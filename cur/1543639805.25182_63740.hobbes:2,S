Yes, perhaps in conjunction with a rationalisation of command packet interface 
to struct request and the block queue that made no prejudgement of what 
actually the command was packetised for.  One modification I was thinking of 
would be simply to make struct_request.cmd a pointer rather than a char array. 
 That way, the prep functions can allocate it and fill it in with an arbitrary 
packet command to be interpreted by the downstream driver (it will also get us 
out of the command size limitation problem---of course, the SCSI committee 
would never consider another command size increase...)

In fact, it would be a particularly deep and rancid can of worms?

Sure, by the time you've got a rational and unified interface that looks good, 
you'll probably have re-written big chunks of scsi and cdrom.  However, if you 
can come up with a good scheme for the sense codes, it would be nice (the ASC 
ASCQ code combinations are in a table that covers thirteen pages of close 
printed type in the SCSI spec---constants.c only has the more frequently used 
ones).
