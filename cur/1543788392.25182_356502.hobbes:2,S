Vitaly has a problem then.  We must _not_ call suspend three times
just because it has different "levels" - SUSPEND_DISABLE,
SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE and SUSPEND_POWER_DOWN.
As I've said earlier in the thread, the only reason these exist is
because no one has gone to the effort of cleaning up the crap left
behind from PM version 1 for the platform devices.
When PM v2 happened, I just hacked the platform device drivers to
work with this new model.  So please consider the three argument
suspend callback a legacy feature and if you're going to use it,
call it exactly once.
And please document that this is the case for your bus type, and
that the "level" argument is meaningless.  Better still, please
do not use the device_driver suspend/resume pointers at all.  Same
argument applies - only platform devices use them, and these should
eventually be killed off.
