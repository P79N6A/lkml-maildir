this isn't allow to be called from IRQ context, because it takes
nl_table_lock for read, but that is taken as
        write_lock_bh(&nl_table_lock);
in 
	static void netlink_table_grab(void)
so without disabling interrupts; which would thus deadlock if this
read_lock-from-irq would hit.

but it's more complex than that, since we ARE in BH context.
The complexity comes from us holding &priv->lock, which is 
used in hard irq context.
so the deadlock is like this:
cpu 0: user context					cpu1: softirq context
   netlink_table_grab takes nl_table_lock as		take priv->lock	in ipw_irq_tasklet
   write_lock_bh, but leaves irqs enabled
   hardirq comes in and the isr tries to take           in ipw_rx, call wireless_send_event which
   priv->lock but has to wait on cpu 1                  tries to take nl_table_lock for read
                                                        but has to wait for cpu0
and... kaboom kabang deadlock :)
