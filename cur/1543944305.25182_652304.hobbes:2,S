Which shows:
 CONFIG_GEN_RTC=y
 CONFIG_GEN_RTC_X=y
Disable that, then those warnings will vanish.  (I'm told that
having proc_register() return a fault code is off the table,
much like impeachment.)
How to fix ... how about:  instead of just warning folk
off such legacy RTC drivers [1] we just wrap them with
an "if RTC_LIB != n" so this mistake won't be possible.
