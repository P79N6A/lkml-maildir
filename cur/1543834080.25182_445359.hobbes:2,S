I'll change this in an updated patch. I wasn't really sure this was 
needed/wanted as I could imagine these driver_alloc() functions enabling
easier debugging of driver specific allocation code (Meaning that you 
can add whatever debugging code to just this specific driver's memory
allocation code).
With friendly regards,
