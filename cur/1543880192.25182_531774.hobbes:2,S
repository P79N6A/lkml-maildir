If it happens just under Linux, this is something that really needs to be
addressed post-haste.  Maybe someone should open a bug in bugzilla to help
track it properly?
If it also happens under Windows, you have been sold defective crap that is
being damaged every time you reboot it, get in touch with the manufacturer
and demand a replacement *new* unit with a firmware fix, or your money back.

Shutdown as in "machine power off", and HDs are under SCSI control (they
appear as scsi devices to userspace, due to libata for example)? Known
issue, see 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7838
 (actually, IMHO
this fix should have been fast-tracked into 2.6.21, instead of queued for
2.6.22).
Shutdown as in reboot/restart?  New bug that needs to be stomped as soon as
possible, but make sure it is not (1) above.
