Apparently so, as we had to add it in the past, mainly because the
feature to limit was not part of the SCSI layer when the original limit
code was added. At that time it replaced a complicated sg breakup
algorithm.
Does your statement guarantee that the default will not change to a
large value? If not, then we need to enforce it in perpetuity...
