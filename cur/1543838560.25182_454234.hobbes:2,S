This tree seems to change the Makefile dependancies in the kconfig 
subdirectory such that a plain compile of the kernel leads to an attempt 
to build the menuconfig targets.  This in turn adds a new dependancy on 
the curses development libraries.

This seems to come from this rather innocent sounding change in that tree:

     kconfig/lxdialog: refactor color support
which also seems to change the Makefile about, specifically bringing the 
sub Makefile into the top level one.
