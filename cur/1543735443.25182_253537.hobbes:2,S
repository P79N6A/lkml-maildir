Without any lock or without any common cacheline that are accessed by 
atomic operations?
I usually consider the costs of
    atomic_inc(&global_atomic_var);
and
    spin_lock(&global_lock);
    global_var++;
    spin_unlock(&global_lock);
as nearly identical (assuming that global_var and global_lock are in the 
same cacheline): one cachline transfer per run. The 5 instructions under 
the spinlock and the theoretical chance that spin_lock() blocks are 
noise compared to the cost of the line transfer.
And that's without thinking about smb_mb__{before,after}_atomic_inc().
Btw, Ingo forgot to mention sequence locks and percpu_counter as two 
high-scalability locking primitives.
