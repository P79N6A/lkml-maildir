And when they are dynamically allocated on a per-object level? Then
you'd have to keep linked lists around to keep track of them. Sorry,
doesn't work.

Because experience shows that the more some people copy the same code
someone will get it wrong.

So you add a few pointers per task compared to the code that does the
demultiplexing. We're talkin 3-4 extra pointers in comparison to the
demultiplexing code *and* the extra function call.
My approach is consitent with the rest of the kernel does for most
structures, struct file operations etc.
But if thats what makes the difference as to whether we go for this
type of API, then lets change it back. I am not married to the API,
but rather the functionality.

Thats really what it was intended for, but of course only in the
task's own context.

Well then the name is somewhat misleading ;-) Sounds almost like
something that could fit into Erik's Job stuff, but I guess it's a
question of what criteria those tasks are put onto that list with.
Being a little short on the history, are there any pointers to
examples or descriptions of what this would be used for? Curious to
understand the usage pattern.

I did go through the archives a while back and I did notice that both
Jack and Erik pointed out a number of issues with those approaches. If
we are going to do the task-group-notify thing, then going to Keith's
approach is probably the best.
Cheers,
