First of all, thank you for your continued development of SD. I've
been using RSDL v.30 since it came out with skunk-sources (a gentoo
patchset). It has ran stable since that time.
I went ahead and taught myself how to patch a kernel together so I
could try  SD-0.46.

My findings:
SD 0.46 is much more responsive than RSDL  0.30. I have portage niced
to 19, make -j2, and it doesn't interfere with Xorg/Beryl at all.
Animations are silky smooth in beryl compared to the standard 2.6.21
scheduler which lags/becomes jerky when there is any kind of load (and
nicing it didn't help). This is especially important since I use
resier4 with cryptcompress (lzo) and it does peg out my CPU at 100%
during portage database rebuilds and searches. Not to mention all the
untaring/unzipping that portage does to build from source (and i have
everything built in tmpfs, so there isn't an i/o limitation).
I have rr_interval at 6 ms.
Xorg is "slightly" more responsive (doesn't lag) under load with nice
-10, although I also have beryl and emerald to worry about too since
they draw the windows and consume cpu. Xorg with nice 0 is still
responsive under all loads, so at least the tweak isn't required.
So far this is my new favorite scheduler. I'm compiling openoffice in
the background right now and I can't even notice it.
I will spend some time with this scheduler to get a feel for its
performance and later try CFS to get a comparison.
