Subject: [patch] ACPI: kbd-pw-on/WOL don't work anymore since 2.4.14
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
since I didn't notice any change about the fact, that since 2.4.14
kernel, after issuing 'halt', the Keyboard Power-ON and Wake-On-LAN
don't work anymore on my ASUS P3B-F, which I reported Thu, 15 Nov 2001
18:43:22 +0100 here on this list, I wrote a small patch to fix
this myself.
The patch does nothing else than suppressing the clearing of the
General Purpose Events (GPEs).
Thanks to Patrick Mochel, who explained me, what was changed
between 2.4.13 and 2.4.14 regarding my problem.
The patch applies to 2.4.14 up to 2.4.18 at least.
With this patch applied and CONFIG_ACPI_NO_GPE_DISABLE #define'd,
Keyboard-Power-ON as well as Wake-On-LAN are working for me,
without this patch or with CONFIG_ACPI_NO_GPE_DISABLE #undef'ined,
both don't work.
Of course, there would be better ways to dynamically change this
behaviour (via some kernel option for example), but the way the
patch goes, was the least invasive one for me.
I have no idea about possible side-effects of suppressing the
execution of acpi_hw_disable_non_wakeup_gpes(), but i'd like
to hear about them, if there are any.
If there are no (relevant) side-effects, I'd be happy, if you'd
consider applying it to 2.4.19 or something like that.
And yes, I did notice, that acpi_hw_disable_non_wakeup_gpes()
should disable *non-wakeup* GPEs, but however - at least for
me it disables more than them :)
PS: I'm not member on the linux-kernel@ list, so please CC me in
    replies, thanks.
regards,
   Mario
