FreeS/WAN when they clean their things up.

You know there's a Ciper- and Digest-API distributed with the
international kernel patch?

Renove DES! Add Serpent and the (five?) finalists of the AES

I think that is application-specific and uncritical w.r.t speed and
therefore belongs to userspace.

Crypted swap with hidden key generated on boot-up from /dev/random? IIRC
HPA was talking about such.

Wouldn't the userspace-to-kernel-to-userspace transitions be too great a
penalty w.r.t speed? Maybe making the CryptoAPI a library would help.

Let the implementations of ciphers for the CryptoAPI get a _lot_ of
peer-reviewing by crypto-professors and they'll run to use these
routines.

As it seems that a linux-crypto ml does not exist yet:

I had not the time to let this happen. Michael, maybe you can talk to
Rik, if you are interested in doing the hosting.
