I remember from working on Unix over 10 years ago, that block devices
required you write multiples of whole blocks, and would otherwise
return "EINVAL" if you tried to write a partial block or tried to seek
to a non-multiple of the blocksize. 
Anyway, Linux allows you to write smaller portions since quite a
while...
