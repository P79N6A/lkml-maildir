Here's a patch with your suggestion implemented.  Seems to work
fine under heavy NFS load for me.  Note that the log recovery has
some inconsistancies already about doing I/O both on locked and
unlocked buffers.  Long-term it might be a good idea to change
xfs_get_buf_noaddr to return a locked buffer like xfs_get_buf(_flags)
does already.
