I wasn't under the impression suspend had really ever worked.  Such a
messy problem to solve.
And how does going back to having new features only arive in stable
kernels every 2 years an improvement over the current system?  Getting
support for new hardware (which lots of users keep insistingon because
for some reason they keep insisting on buying the stuff that is currently
for sale) also requires writing new code.
