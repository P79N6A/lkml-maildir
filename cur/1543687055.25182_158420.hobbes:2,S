As others have said some apps use "interesting" signals normally.  For
instance probably the most common is vmware.  vmware sends itself SIGSEGV
all the time (at startup, at least) as part of its memory-management foo:
Aug 12 14:11:23 foo kernel: grsec: signal 11 sent to (vmware-ui:12180) \
	UID(XXXX) EUID(XXXX), parent (vmware:17653) UID(XXXX) EUID(XXXX)
Aug 12 14:11:23 foo kernel: grsec: signal 11 sent to (vmware-mks:25238) \
	UID(XXXX) EUID(XXXX), parent (vmware:17653) UID(XXXX) EUID(XXXX)
Aug 12 14:11:23 foo kernel: grsec: signal 11 sent to (vmware:17653) \
	UID(XXXX) EUID(XXXX), parent (bash:2883) UID(XXXX) EUID(XXXX)
..So not *all* such cases are cause for alarm.  However, if you run one of
the patches enabling logging of this, you quickly learn what's normal for
the apps you run, and can teach your log-auditing tools and/or your brain
to ignore them.
