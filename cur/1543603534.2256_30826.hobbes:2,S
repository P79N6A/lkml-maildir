For the moment I plan to maintain the 2.4.*-ac tree. I don't know what will
happen about 2.4 longer term - that is a Linus question. Looking at
historical VM history I don't think we will eliminate enough "2.4.10+ oops
on my box" and "on this load the VM sucks" cases from 2.4.10 to fairly 
review Andrea's VM until Linus has done another 5 or 6 releases and the VM
has been tuned, bugs removed and other oops cases proven not to be vm
triggered.
