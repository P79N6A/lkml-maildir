The current numa=fake=N kernel command line option is just boottime,
and just x86_64.
I presume we'd have to remove these two constraints for this to be 
generally usable to containerize memory.
We also, in my current opinion, need to fix up the node_distance
between such fake numa sibling nodes, to correctly reflect that they
are on the same real node (LOCAL_DISTANCE).
And some non-trivial, arch-specific, zonelist sorting and reconstruction
work will be needed.
And an API devised for the above mentioned dynamic changing.
And this will push on the memory hotplug/unplug technology.
All in all, it could avoid anything more than trivial changes to the
existing memory allocation code hot paths.  But the infrastructure
needed for managing this mechanism needs some non-trivial work.

As the linux-mm discussion last weekend examined in detail, we can
eliminate this performance speed bump, probably by caching the
last zone on which we found some memory.  The linear search that was
implicit in __alloc_pages()'s use of zonelists for many years finally
become explicit with this new usage pattern.

I haven't read these patches enough to quite make sense of this, but I
suspect that this is not a distinction between cpusets and these
containers, for the basic reason that cpusets doesn't need to 'move'
a file's references because it has no clue what such are.

This may be a deciding point.
