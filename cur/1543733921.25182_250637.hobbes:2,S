linux/fs/xfs/support/debuc.c:
    84	void
    85	cmn_err(register int level, char *fmt, ...)
    86	{
[...]
   105		if (level == CE_PANIC)
   106			BUG();
   107	}
Using cmn_err with CE_PANIC will show up as this, so it's likely your
google search is showing multiple different bugs, many of which have
been fixed.  You need to check the stack traces to see if they are the
same.
