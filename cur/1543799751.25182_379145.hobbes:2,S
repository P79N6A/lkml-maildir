The Statement ----> const typeof( ((type *)0)->member) *__mptr =
(ptr); is basically declaring a constant pointer of the data-type
exactly same as the member data-type  of the type (can be "struct foo"
let say) argument. For this by specifying ((type *)0)->member you
actually telling the compiler that at the address 0 my type (struct
foo) pointer is located and get me the member field of it and then my
typeof you are getting the typeof the member field. If you don't
specify (type *)0 then how you can tell the compiler to get the typeof
member field of the type (struct foo).
I hope you are will be able to get answer with my explanation.

I just say that check your header files included, because I think the
.h file containing definition of struct ath_buf is not included and
the list_entry won't able to create __mptr pointer or so !
