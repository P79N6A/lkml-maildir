Actually I haven't tested further kernels than 2.5.45 as I just spent the night moving
 files from the laptop that suffered, alas, uncorrectable drive errors. Luckily the only
 file lost was linux-2.5.45.tar :) I only hope that the poweroffs didn't help the drive
 to die earlier than it should have :/
