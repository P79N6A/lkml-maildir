Yeah. :)

It's C code, not shell, so that was off the top of my head. :)
And that, in fact, is one of the big reasons that there's a utility for it: 
not accidentally deleting anything out of your root partition is kind of 
important.
(Another is that calling chroot and such after deleting their binaries out of 
initramfs but before the paths are adjusted so that the ones in the new root 
can find their shared libraries is a bit of a headache.  It's a lot easier to 
just have it all in one binary that's already loaded everything it needs and 
frees its memory on exec.)
