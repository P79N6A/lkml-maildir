	I can't guarantee it'll fix it, but Ingo Molnar suggested I tell
the kernel that I have an even multiple 2M of memory (One quick test
seemed to indicate that it actually might need to be a multiple of 4M, but
I'm not sure of that).
	So, if you think you have 64M of memory in the system and your
kernel image is named "linux_new" in LILO (press TAB at the lilo prompt if
you're not sure), try:
linux_new mem=64M
	at the LILO prompt.  If that doesn't work, try mem=60M or other
even numbers less than the real amount of memory.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
