Shouldn't we be syncing them all before the suspend anyway, to
minimize corruption in case the user chooses to mount the filesystem
*without* resuming (think a dual-boot configuration.)  This would be
another application for the "supersync" operation that was discussed
at OLS 2002 -- a need for an operation which not only flushes all
blocks to disk but also forces the journal to be replayed and
truncated.
