   to power fail -- so I expect it to do full fsck anyway.
   I'm told that when you force-fsck NT they find some FS corruption over
   extended periods of time, so that "fsck-after-crash" might give sense
   after all.
What kind of SW crash ?
Unless the FS itself code failed, the filesystem on disk is still in valid
state. With a good FS that is.
