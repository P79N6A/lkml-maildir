Subject: [PATCH -mm] select_bad_process: kill a bogus PF_DEAD/TASK_DEAD check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/27/65

(Compile tested, on top of introduce-task_dead-state.patch)
The only one usage of TASK_DEAD outside of last schedule path,
select_bad_process:
	for_each_task(p) {
		if (!p->mm)
			continue;
		...
			if (p->state == TASK_DEAD)
				continue;
		...
TASK_DEAD state is set at the end of do_exit(), this means that p->mm
was already set == NULL by exit_mm(), so this task was already rejected
by 'if (!p->mm)' above.
Note also that the caller holds tasklist_lock, this means that p can't
pass exit_notify() and then set TASK_DEAD when p->mm != NULL.
Also, remove open-coded is_init().
