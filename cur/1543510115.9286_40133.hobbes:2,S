What do you call real device driver support?
Device drivers on all systems have to be linked in with the kernel. Linux
already has support for loading and unloading individual modules, and almost
all the device drivers are already done that way.
It is unfortunate that the kernel interface keeps changing, and they expect
you to recompile after every kernel patch.

If what you wanted is something like Sun's DDI/DKI, you should probably look
at UDI. It provides a device driver interface that is portable among several
operating systems. The prototype was done on Linux and Intel is doing the
changes to make it compliant with 1.0 of the specification.
