Bullshit.
17 USC 106(3) talks about transfer of ownership *of the item*, not of the
copyright itself (see 17 USC 202, which clarifies this).  So you can sell a
book - but that isn't transferring the copyright of the book.  There isn't any
actual transfer without a document that actually *SAYS* "transfer of copyright" -
see 17 USC 204 (a) (Note that there's whole companies in Utah, with actual
large legal teams, that seem unclear on the concept in 17 USC 204(a), so I'm
not surprised that you're confused on this as well).
