Yes I have seen that. Normally a lot of these greater that 4GB
interfaces are activated on BITS_PER_LONG. We have passed a few changes
on to adapter driver maintainers to activate these interfaces also on
the CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G. This has helped on these 32 bit greater than 4GB
systems.
What driver does the FCA 2214 use?
