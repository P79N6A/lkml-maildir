I don't think -fno-builtin has any bearing on whether gcc will emit calls to 
memcpy; instead it prevents gcc from open-coding them when it thinks it 
understands what's going on.
Try this with gcc -O2 -S, and again with -fno-builtin:
struct s { int a[200]; };
f(struct s *a, struct s *b)
{
  *b = *a;
}
g(int *a, int *b)
{
  memcpy(b, a, 4);
}
p.
