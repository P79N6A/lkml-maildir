Actually it was: 99f895518368252ba862cc15ce4eb98ebbe1bec6
Which is what you url points to, odd.

The patch looks correct.  Although this won't cause anyone problems as the code
is disabled.

As for enabling this.  I believe we need an extra permission check just before
we copy the data from our temporary buffer to the target task, to ensure
nothing has changed.  The history does not really capture why this code
was disabled, but before this gets enabled I would like to understand more
than just the comment.  I believe with a little care this can be safely enabled
as it doesn't let you do anything ptrace wouldn't do, and it should let you do
it anytime except when ptrace would allow it.  Thus not introducing any new
security holes.
