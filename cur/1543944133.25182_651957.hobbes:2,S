Actually, it sort of does.  If you look here:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jejb/merge-tree/
You'll find a merge candidate tree that builds nightly from everyone's
git and quilt trees.  I'm using it to track merge conflicts (so I only
build the patch, I don't check it compiles).
You're welcome to the scripts that do this:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jejb/build.pl
And the config file that runs it:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jejb/merge-tree-build
I don't plan to do much more than keep it building to check conflicts,
so you're welcome to take it over.

Actually the experiment with the -mc tree shows that most of the
conflicts are trivial in nature (usually docbook stuff or
feature-removal.txt stuff), so you can do a trivial triage by hand.  You
can't automatically drop them (well, not unless you want to end up
dropping half the trees).
The other problem is that we actually maintain deliberate conflicts with
a last person to merge fixes it type attitude.  Again, it's usually in
minor areas, and the fixups are fairly trivial, but it illustrates why
conflicts can't be a reason to drop a tree, you have to maintain some
sort of automatic fixup (at least I had to with the -mc tree).  The
reason we do this is that it would give the maintainers a nasty web of
included trees (which is almost impossible for the quilt trees anyway)
if we tried to resolve the conflicts and destroy our ability to rebase.

Yes, this is the bit I've never dared do ... principally because it's
such a time sink.
