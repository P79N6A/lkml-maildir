Me too.  As I increase the number of arguments, I now have
a smooth cutover from "works" to "Arg list too long", without
the in between zone where the process is killed.
The IA-32 compatability exec path is now working too (I didn't
stress it too hard, but I did try argument lists up to a megabyte).
