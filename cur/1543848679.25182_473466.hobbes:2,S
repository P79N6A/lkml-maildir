You would only be changing it for the multithreaded path, which itself is 
very new.  But this is all hypothetical anyway...

So the question is what do do if someone calls device_register() or
device_add() with dev->driver set.  If everything succeeds except for
creation of the symlinks, should the device remain registered?  The driver
core has been vacillating about this recently.  I'm not sure what the 
right answer is.
However the kerneldoc for device_attach() should be updated to mention
that when multithreaded probing is used, a driver might end up getting
bound even though the return value is 0.

P.S.: If you initialize probe_task to ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM) or something 
similar, then you could eliminate one of the calls to bus_for_each_drv() 
in device_attach().
