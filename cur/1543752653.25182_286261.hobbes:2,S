In general I think it was a bad idea to merge this driver at all.
The protocol is obviously broken by design - they use a 16 bit sequence
number space which has been proven for many years (in ip fragmentation)
to be far too small for modern network performance.
Also the memory allocation without preallocation in the block write
out path looks quite broken too and will most likely will lead to deadlocks
under high load.
(I wrote a detailed review when it was posted but apparently it 
disappeared or I never got any answer at least) 
IMHO this thing should have never been merged in this form. Can it 
still be backed out?
