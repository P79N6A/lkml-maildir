Hello,
could someone please tell me if XFS is trustworthy in the latest 2.6.16? 
There have been some bugs:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6380
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6757
and maybe there are more of them. I would like to stay on the 2.6.16 
branch as I don't like to update my kernel several times a week. I just 
want a stable kernel and 2.6.16 seems to fit all my needs.
Thank you very much in advance
Yours
Manuel Reimer
