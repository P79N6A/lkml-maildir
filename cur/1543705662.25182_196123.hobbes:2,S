A kernel profile is needed.

Sounds unlikely.

Could be a networking problem, but boy that's a lot of CPU time.
Please, do this:
- Boot with `profile=1' on the kernel command line
sudo readprofile -r
sudo readprofile -M10
time <whatever command it is that is causing the problem>
readprofile -n -v -m /boot/System.map | sort -n +2 | tail -40 | tee ~/log
Making very sure that /boot/System.map is the correct map file for the
currently-running kernel.
Thanks.
