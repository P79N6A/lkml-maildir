The problem I see, based on reading this list, is that the testing is
not so thorough as you say.  First of all, do we really know how many
people test the pre-relase kernels?  How about which features they
actually test?
In principle, we could find out how much test coverage there is.
The problem with an army of testers, is that after an individual has
gone through the build/install/screw-around-with-it process a few
hundred times, it starts to get a bit repetitive.  They start to get
sloppy and haphazard regarding what they test or whether they even try
out xxx-pre<put_big_number_here> at all.  If we could automate at
least some basic testing that would be a big win.
