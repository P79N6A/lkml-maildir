Subject: [PATCH] Typo in md.c

Hi Marcelo.
There's a small typo in drivers/md/md.c where detected_devices[] which should
be of the type kdev_t is wrongly typed as an int.
These are the only two references to detected_devices[]:
void md_autodetect_dev(kdev_t dev)
{
	if (dev_cnt >= 0 && dev_cnt < 127)
		detected_devices[dev_cnt++] = dev;
}
static void autostart_arrays(void)
{
	...
	for (i = 0; i < dev_cnt; i++) {
		kdev_t dev = detected_devices[i];
	...
}
Patch is included, please apply.
Regards,
	Jakob Kemi
