True ... staring at unfamiliar code made me forget a few things ;-)
OK, the below patch works, no oopses, no hangs. If this is acceptable
(even if it's not the final solution), could you apply it? Seems to
be better than the current situation, at any rate.
-----------------------------------------------------
We can encounter a race condition where task->sighand can be NULL in 
proc_pid_status, resulting in an offset NULL pointer dereference in 
render_sigset_t. This can be easily demonstrated running SDET with a 
load of 32 to 64 on a large machine (16x NUMA-Q in this case).
This patch makes us take task_lock around the sighand deferences,
and fixes the oops in testing on the same machine. Thanks to Linus,
Andrew, Manfred and Zwane for lots of guidance ;-)
