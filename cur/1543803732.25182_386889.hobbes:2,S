Also, some people mentioned tuning, I used 8192 as the w/r size it then 
took 15 seconds, with 65535 it took 28 seconds.
I wonder how much faster NFS over TCP would be, or if NFS in the kernel is 
the problem itself?
Will try later thanks.
FTP seems to be the winner for now:
<--- 226 8.927 seconds (measured here), 78.31 Mbytes per second
733045488 bytes transferred in 9 seconds (77.08M/s)
