Unfortunately, this is going to involve deep hackery inside the error handler. 
 The current initial premise is that it can simply retry the failing command 
by issuing an ABORT to the tag and resending it (which can cause a tag to move 
past your barrier).  In an error situation, it really wouldn't be wise to try 
to abort lots of potentially running tags to preserve the barrier ordering 
(because of the overload placed on a known failing component), so I think the 
error handler has to abandon the concept of aborting commands and move 
straight to device reset.  We then carefully resend the commands in FIFO order.
Additionally, you must handle the case that a device is reset by something 
else (in error handler terms, the cc_ua [check condition/unit attention]).  
Here also, the tags would have to be sent back down in FIFO order as soon as 
the condition is detected.

Other OSs (well the ones I've heard about: Solaris and HP-UX) try to avoid 
ordered tags, mainly because of the performance impact they have---the drive 
tag service algorithms become inefficient in the presence of ordered tags 
since they're usually optimised for all simple tags.
