Good. I use that sound driver too (I was the one who updated it and
caused the commotion back in 2.4.9 :)
I am interested if you see any different times if you switch to ALSA,
though.

The scheduler does hold some spinlocks.  So does VM.  I am working on
some ideas to tackle the highest of the worst-case spinlocks. Stay
tuned.

5ms is not an issue at all, especially for a worst case spinlock... no
problem here.

We are getting higher, but still not an issue.  I'll theorize below why
I think it is increasing...

Now we are above what I consider perfect (10ms), but I still am not
concenrned until 15-20ms times.  The list I am compiling is of much
higher problems, so you are fine here too.
The reason I think it jumps during the higher threaded dbenchs is for
the obvious reason - more I/O.  This is causing more seeks and longer
tranversing of the I/O queue.

0.2ms is ideal for any system :)

You see 1-3second skips in the audio? With the 0.2ms latencies? Grr,
odd.

Still OK.
Thanks for the feedback.
