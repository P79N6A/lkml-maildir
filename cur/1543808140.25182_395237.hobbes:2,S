I've begun briefly to have a look at this.
Part of the problem I have, both with doing incremental patches for swsusp
and with doing a userspace version, is that some of the fundamentals are
redesigned in suspend2. The most important of these is that we store the
metadata in bitmaps (for pageflags) and extents (for storage) instead of
pbes. Do you have thoughts on how to overcome that issue? Are you
willing, for example, to do work on switching swsusp to use a different
method of storing its data?
