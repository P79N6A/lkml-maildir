So why not just add file->f_op->ftruncate() and file->f_op->fstat()?
Most filesystems can trivially redirect these to do_truncate() and their
existing getattr() method. Those, like FUSE, that care can use the hook.
In fact, I think that NFSv4 could also benefit from an ftruncate():
currently we have to hunt around for an open file context for that
particular case.
