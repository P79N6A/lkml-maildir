Hi everybody.
Does someone know if it's planned (or even in the works) to support
newer versions of the UDF filesystem?
Especially the versions 2.50 and 2.60 would be very interesting for
mounting BluRay discs (and HD DVD)...
I've seen somewhere a patch but that was pretty old and AFAIK not yet
finished or included in the vanilla tree.
Best wishes,
Chris.
