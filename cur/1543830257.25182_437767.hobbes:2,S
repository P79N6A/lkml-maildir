The difficulty I have there is that suspending to disk doesn't seem to me to 
be something where you can add a bit at a time like that. I do have proc 
entries that allow you to say "Just freeze the processes and prepare the 
metadata, then free it and exit" (freezer_test) and "Do everything but 
actually writing the image and doing the atomic copy, then exit 
(test_filter_speed), for diagnosing problems and tuning the configuration, 
but if I start were to start again with nothing, I'd only write the dynamic 
pageflags code to start with and submit it (giving you lib/dyn_pageflags.c 
and kernel/power/pageflags.c), then the refrigerator changes and the extent 
code and so on. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm not mutating 
swsusp into suspend2 here, and I don't think I can. Suspend2 is a 
reimplementation of swsusp, not a series of incremental modifications. It 
uses completely different methods for writing the image, storing the metadata 
and so on. Until recently, the only thing it shared with swsusp was the 
refrigerator and driver model calls, and even now the sharing of lowlevel 
code is only a tiny fraction of all that is done.
Could I ask what might be a dumb question in this regard - why isn't Reiser4 
going through the same process? Is it an indication that I shouldn't have 
submitted these patches and should have just asked Andrew to take Suspend2 
into mm, or is there something different between Reiser4 and Suspend2 that 
I'm missing?
Regards,
Nigel
