Hi all -- I was recently trying to record a high bandwidth signal & ran
into the bandwidth limit of my ultra-dma drive. 
I've hacked the program & also bonnie-big to write alternate blocks to two
files on different ide interfaces, with the idea that I'd get more bandwidth
writing to two disks.
I get the odd result that this actually slows down the data rate.
Anyone know what's going on here? Is there some other bottleneck? Is
software raid going to give me the same result (slower than one drive)?
I'm running an ASUS P2B-D, 2.2 kernel. hdparm for both drives are set to 
"-d 1 -m 16 -u 1 -c 1".
This result is basically the same for either drive. One is primary master,
the other secondary slave. The secondary master is a cd burner which is
not accessed during the test:

This is the result for writing to two disks:
