I don't understand the ATA spec issue, but *every* PCMCIA ATA device I
know of (including all SmartMedia, CompactFlash, etc) suffers from
this problem.  It is not an isolated manufacturer.  As far as I know,
the IDE driver has always had the problem that it may trigger
interrupts before it installs a handler.  Are you saying that is only
true of pre-ATA-4 devices, or only devices that deviate from the spec?
