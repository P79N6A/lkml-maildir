I don't see what longhorn and quartz have to do with the question at
hand (this plan to cram FB and DRM together).
If we want to do the pretty graphics things that these improvements to
graphics on other OSes have done, we don't need to touch FB at all.  We
already have X Servers with the composite extension.  We've got a vector
graphics library.  Now we need to make those go fast.  We can do the
go-faster part within the X Server and the vector graphics library
without touching the DRM, FB, or anyone else.  I'm spending far too much
of my free time currently working on this.
Now, another good project is to get our 3d drivers to the point that we
could write our X Server on top of that.  Basically, we need pbuffer
support for that.  That'll touch the DRM and client drivers (and our
current X Servers, though that part wouldn't be used in the X-on-GL
model).  Again, not FB.
A completely separate issue is how to arrange for synchronization
between the multiple users of the graphics hardware on linux.  I think a
pretty decent model has been proposed by the Linux kernel people, and it
seems rather simple.  FreeBSD is happy with it because it doesn't affect
us in any way.  (When we get around to dealing with the issue (if ever),
i.e. when we've got accelerated graphics layers for console, I'm quite
sure we'll follow the same model of a relatively generic lock in the
kernel which all graphics clients will use to arbitrate hardware
access).
Please, stop trotting out Longhorn and Quartz to justify whatever you're
trying to push into the kernel.
