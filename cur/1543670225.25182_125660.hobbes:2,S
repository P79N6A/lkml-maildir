On hdh, it appears you're setting the max lba > the native size.  Maybe this
is the problem.
For RAID on two drives, I would imagine your RAID size would need to be the
size of the smaller device, not the larger device.  (Note that they aren't
identical).
Not sure if the two different CHS translation modes on each drive is
important or not (probably not), that legacy bios stuff is something that
has always confused me...
