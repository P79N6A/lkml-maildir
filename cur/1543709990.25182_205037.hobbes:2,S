not at all. I pointed out specific workloads that create tons of vmas,
which would perform very bad if swapping. OASB is not one of those
workloads. [I could also mention UML which currently creates a vma per
virtualized page, which, with a low-end UML setup, generates tens of
thousands of vmas as well.]
(if the linear search is fixed then i have no objections, but for the
current code to hit any mainline kernel we would first need to redefine
'enterprise quality'. My main worry is that we are now at a dozen emails
regarding this topic and you still dont seem to be aware of the severity
of this quality of implementation problem.)
sure, remap_file_pages() fixes such problems - while i'm happy if more
people use remap_file_pages(), apps are not (and should not be) forced
to use remap_file_pages() and i refuse to concede that the VM must
inevitably get wedged with just a couple of thousand vmas created on a
256 MB 500 MHz box ... I dont know how to put this point in a simpler
way. This stuff must not be added (to mainline) until it can take the
load.
