As a follow-up to my post: I just checked what already got in and what's 
still missing. I attached the stuff from request_firmwar() that didn't 
make it into the kernel yet.
Please note that I did not check if the problem has been solved 
otherwise. Perhaps Manuel Estrada Sainz <ranty@debian.org> can tell us 
what the current state is?
CU
Michael.
