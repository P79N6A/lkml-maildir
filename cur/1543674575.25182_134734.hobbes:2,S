Subject: 2.5.69 won't mount root on md device

Hello!
I tried out both 2.5.69 and 2.5.69-mm8, both which won't mount my root
filesystem on a RAID 1 device (/dev/md1).
All md devices are recognized and - so it seems - initialized
correctly while booting (the kernel even wants to reconstruct them if
they aren't clean) but mounting the root fs fails with the following
message:
can't mount root filesystem "901" or "/dev/md1"
(message typed from memory, no serial console currently available)
.config included. Any suggestions?
Regards,
Julien
