Yes, the obvious and stupid implementation has a ton of problems.
Most likely the right approach is some sort of background deamon
(garbage collector, defragmenter, journald, whatever you may call it)
that does exacly this even after the fact for the last unchecked
writes.  Asyncronous under load, possibly even synchronous when almost
idle.
A stupid implementation would still help for some workload (few, while
hurting many) and already get the code tested, so even a stupid
implementation helps.
