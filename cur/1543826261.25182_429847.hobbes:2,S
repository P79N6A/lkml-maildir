I tested this _A_LOT_ and it doesn't matter if I
use "nvidia" binary drivers or x.org's free "nv" or
have just a text console with no X at all.
It happens on a production machine :(
Most easily to trigger this bug is to use USB2.0 epson
scanner over and have scanbuttond running - it will poll
scan buttons via usb2.0 and crash
