Let me explain it to you again:
1) ZONE_NORMAL + ZONE_DMA is low on free memory
2) the memory is taken by buffer heads, these
   buffer heads belong to pagecache pages that
   live in highmem
3) the highmem zone has enough free memory
As you probably know, shrink_caches() has the following line
of code to make sure it won't try to free highmem pages:
                if (!memclass(page->zone, classzone))
                        continue;
Of course, this line of code also means it will not take
away the buffer heads from highmem pages, so the ZONE_NORMAL
and ZONE_DMA memory USED BY THE BUFFER HEADS will not be
freed.

Rik
