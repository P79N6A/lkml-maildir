You do realize how foolish that sounds?  Why do you think

I'm with Dmitry; the whole thing becomes much, much simpler if we put back
your patch and prevent sysfs access after unregistering an attribute 
file.  No API changes are needed, no driver changes are needed, no radical 
core changes are needed,...  All we would have to do is fix the one SCSI 
method to make it use a workqueue.
