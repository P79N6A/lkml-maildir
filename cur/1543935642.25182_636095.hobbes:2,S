 Hi,all
I'd like to say something about this issue.
Currently,the blackfin on chip SD host ONLY support 1-bit MMC while
support 1-bit/4-bit SD/SDIO.
And we want our driver to support both 1-bit MMC and 4-bit SD/SDIO.but
the current MMC driver framework
Only allow us to set one kind of bus width,either 1-bit or 4-bit.So in
order to meet our case,we need more flexible mechanism
To inform the upper commom driver to know our situation.
Cliff

As Mike said, the reason split this flag is because Blackfin on-chip
SDIO controller's limitation.
Cliff is working on it for a long time, so I dropped him in. Hope he can
clarify the confusing things.
