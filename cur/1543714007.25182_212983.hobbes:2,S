Greetings all;
I just rebooted to 2.6.5-mm3 while a cd with the Planet CCRMA image on 
it was in the writer.  It took the boot about 5 seconds to get past 
the IDE1 piece of the scan, and it squawked about the drive having 
'incompatible media'.  I have a line in my rc.local that uses hdparm 
to turn the dma back on after the kernel decides to turn it off, and 
that also spit out a media error although an hdparm -d indicates dma 
is on.  dma works just fine with that drive.
After bootup, I tried to mount the disk, but again got the media error 
and fail message.  Removing the disk and rebooting again, and its all 
working again.
Is this a bug?  Seems like it to me.  Its not something I've noted 
before, but then the drive is usually empty, so this is a new error 
to me and I cannot say when it started happening.

Cheers, Gene
