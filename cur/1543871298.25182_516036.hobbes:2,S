Hello Adrian,
> does the patch in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/23/184
 fix your problem?
Yes, it does, so it's a Good One (tm), but I don't understand what's going
on then... My dmesg says, related to rtc :
...
rtc_cmos 00:03: rtc core: registered rtc_cmos as rtc0
pnp: Device 00:03 does not support disabling.
rtc_cmos: probe of 00:03 failed with error -16
...
and then later :
...
drivers/rtc/hctosys.c: unable to open rtc device (rtc0)
...
What does this all mean ? I thought an RTC Cmos was always there on a
standard PC motherboard... (that's why I had activated the option in the
first time).
Regards,
Paul
