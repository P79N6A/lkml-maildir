Subject: [patch 0/5] RFC: fault-injection capabilities
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch set provides some fault-injection capabilities.
- kmalloc failures
- alloc_pages() failures
- disk IO errors
We can see what really happens if those failures happen.
In order to enable these fault-injection capabilities:
1. Enable relevant config options (CONFIG_FAILSLAB, CONFIG_PAGE_ALLOC,
   CONFIG_MAKE_REQUEST) and runtime configuration kernel module
   (CONFIG_SHOULD_FAIL_KNOBS)
2. build and boot with this kernel
3. modprobe should_fail_knob
4. configure fault-injection capabilities behavior by debugfs
For example about kmalloc failures:
/debug/failslab/probability
	specifies how often it should fail in percent.
/debug/failslab/interval
	specifies the interval of failures.
/debug/failslab/times
	specifies how many times failures may happen at most.
/debug/failslab/space
	specifies the size of free space where memory can be allocated
	safely in bytes.
5. see what really happens.
The idea is taken from failmalloc (
http://www.nongnu.org/failmalloc/
).
Andrew Morton gave me interesting suggestions.
