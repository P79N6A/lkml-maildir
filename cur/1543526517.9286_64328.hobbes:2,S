Hello,
I have a running 2.2.14 kernel, with the 0.18.5 nfsv3-client patch.
I have the following problems:
-- Sound rate is incorrect: I have an ES1888 at 0x220, irq 5, dma 1 and 5.
I have a 44.1 KHz, 16 bits stereo wav file. When I play it with this
command line, it works correctly:
  sox -t .wav bla.wav -t ossdsp -r 17950 /dev/dsp
However, if I use the following:
  sox -t .wav bla.wav -t ossdsp -r 17951 /dev/dsp
I get a distorted sound; it seems that the data is sent to the card
at half-pace, music is one octave lower, it runs for twice the correct
length. Same for any rate above 17951.
The sound used to work with kernel 2.2.9. Between 2.2.9 and 2.2.14, I do
not know.
-- The clock locally drifts. I use xntp3-5.93-2 (from RedHat 5.1) and I
get messages like this:
time reset -1.652937 s
synchronisation lost
about three or four times per hour. This is not critical since I am
never drifted more than 2 seconds, but this is annoying since my mailbox
and homedir are NFS-mounted. The box is an Alpha ev56 at 516 MHz (a 500 MHz
model a bit overclocked). /proc/cpuinfo gives this:

user unaligned acc	: 0 (pc=0,va=0)
platform string		: Digital Personal WorkStation 533au
cpus detected		: 1
Maybe there is some configuration problem I missed ? ntpd, after a few
hours, sets the drift value in ntp.drift to -500.000, which seems to be
some sort of extremum.
Thanks in advance for any info. I could not try 2.2.15-pre9 since it is
not compatible with the nfsv3 patch.
