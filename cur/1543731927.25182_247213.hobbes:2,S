Yes, I remember this was discussed at the same time. However, I don't see
that boot time display actually is connected to uptime. Boot time is
available in /proc/stat as seconds sice the beginning of the epoch. It's
now derived from wall_to_monotonic, thus should be reasonable constant
(and I'm not aware of recent reports that say otherwise).
If some program thinks it has to calculate boot time from 
gettimeofday() - uptime, and it drifts, so what?
It's got a better way to do that. But there are no better ways to recover 
from inconsistent statistics in /proc.
