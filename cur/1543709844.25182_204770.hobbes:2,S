I have the same problem as you have. I have not gotten around to test
your patch yet (but will later tonight), but I read in another mail from
you that you had discussed the patch with Urban Widmark. Is the any
opinions against this patch? If not, will you try to submit it to
Andrew/Linus?
Anyway, thanks for the patch :)
Best regards,
Stian
