No it has nothing to do with early_node_mem which is just a thin
wrapper around find_e820_area() anyways.
I think the problem is that the page alignment in bad_addr() and friends is not 
always correct. e.g. the early_reserve for the kernel in head64.c really need to 
round up to pages. I suspect (not 100% sure yet that is the core of the problem) 
Note this was broken even before early reservation; the only difference
was that it was all hard coded in bad_addr() then.
There were various hacks around this in the past, but none fixed the problem 
completely.

That is find_e820_area() or rather find_e820_area+early_reserve now.
I had this implemented as a shrink wrapped function earlier for lockdep too, 
but dropped the patch because there was a nasty ordering issue with the e820 
command line parsing that i could not easily resolve.
