Hm. Could some kind soul please enlighten me what was wrong with my patch ?
AFAIK %ebx isn't used globally in the kernel (like PIC in userland). When I
check the asm output in -pre8 I get (ewrk3.s:3503):
	...
        movl 24(%esp),%esi
        movl (%ebx,%edx,4),%edi
#APP
        cld
        movl %esi,%edi
        repne
        scasb
        notl %ecx
        decl %ecx
        movl %ecx,%edx
1:      movl %esi,%edi
        movl %esi,%eax
	...
where especially the last two lines look confusing to me. What exactly is
%esi supposed to hold ? Why does %edi get overwritten so early before it gets
used at all ? ? ?
IMNSHO after the patch that got applied for -pre8 the %8 had to be changed to
%9 to accomodate for the extra operand somehow, and "4" should probably read
"5" as well, but then the whole thing doesn't compile any more.
On the other hand, my version produces:
	...
        movl 32(%esp),%esi
        movl (%ebx,%edx,4),%ebx
#APP
        cld
        movl %ebx,%edi
        repne
        scasb
        notl %ecx
        decl %ecx
        movl %ecx,%edx
1:      movl %ebx,%edi
        movl %esi,%eax
	...
Which looks OK to me. Opinions ?
[ I changed asm-i386/string.h line 213,8 (?) to read:
        "jne 1b\n\t"
        "xorl %%eax,%%eax\n\t"
        "2:"
        :"=a" (__res),  "=&c" (d0),       "=&S" (d1),   "=&d" (d2), "=&D" (d3)
        : "0" (0),      "1" (0xffffffff), "2" (cs),     "b" (ct));
return __res;
}
and no need for d4 since %ebx remains unaltered ]
Please give it a (last) try !

P.S.: I too prefer processors that have _registers_, not crooks like
Intel&compats.
