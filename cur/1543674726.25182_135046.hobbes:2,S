I have compiled in vesafb. My Radeon 9700 is running on lastest ATI 
drivers in X. Everything is ok , till I enter X and then exit. After 
exiting console is totally messed up. There is no chance to even read a 
single character.Kernel is patched with nforce2 agp support Everything 
was ok on 2.4.21-rc2-ac3 which I also patched with nforce2 agp.
Asus A7N8X-deluxe on nforce2
Radeon 9700
Sorry for such poor describe of bug but I'm new to linux:(
