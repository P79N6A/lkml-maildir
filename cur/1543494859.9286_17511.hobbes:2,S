Whle this discussion continues, I'd like to remind people of the
the work of the linux scalability project, at 
http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/citi-netscape/
Some of these patches have already been applied to current kernels; but 
some have not, and there are some issues described there for which there 
are yet no solutions, including the poll() work there....
