Right.  Ted's observation says that network traffic should not
contribute to the entropy *count*.  However, it is probably still
useful to add network traffic timings to the pool (without bumping
up the count).  Adding extra traffic to the pool should not hurt,
unless the cryptographic hash function is insecure (in which case
you've probably got worse problems than chosen-timing attacks).
