Hi Corey,

I like this. You're right, there is code duplication here, which we can
get rid of, so let's do so. I'd only have one comments about your patch:
You can get rid of the dev_dbg calls in i2c_master_send() and
i2c_master_recv() altogether IMHO. I recently updated i2c_transfer() to
make it more verbose in debug mode [1], so the debug messages in
i2c_master_send() and i2c_master_recv() are mostly redundant now as far
as I can see.
