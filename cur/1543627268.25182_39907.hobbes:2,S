I'm not sure, but I don't think any code is needed if you run X.  Bung
four USB mice, four USB keyboards in and four video cards.  Write a
separate X config for each one specifying which PCI card should be used
and which mouse/keyboard device should be used.  Now start an X server
for each one.
(Fun should form in the efforts to figure out which mouse is associated
with which keyboard and with which video output).
