test5-mm4 crashed during RAID-1 autodetection and setup.
It got as far as:
md: created md0
md: bind<hda1>
md: bind<hdb1>
md: running: <hdb1><hda1>
After this, I usually get this (from test5-mm3 dmesg):
raid1: raid set md0 active with 2 out of 2 mirrors
md: ... autorun DONE.
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Instead, I got the dump at the end of this message.
I'm using devfs and Viro's compile fix for devfs in mm4.
The root fs is on raid-1, the raid-1 gets autodetected.
The kernel has no module support, and no initrd.
Here's the dump:
Unable to handle null pointer deref at virtual address 00000000
