I can see the use for this, but you can also just do `echo whatever >

It is automatically inherited by its children.

My patch already does this.  If the user writing the affinity entry is
the same as the user of the task in question, everything is fine.  If
the user possesses the CAP_SYS_NICE bit, he can set any task's
affinity.  See the patch.
