Here's what a Quake server looks like, in case anyone is in doubt on this
one:
22:05:13.360531 oldselect(1, NULL, NULL, NULL, {0, 1}) = 0 (Timeout)
22:05:13.370390 gettimeofday({945209113, 370452}, {4294967236, 0}) = 0
22:05:13.370535 gettimeofday({945209113, 370584}, {4294967236, 0}) = 0
22:05:13.370657 oldselect(1, [0], NULL, NULL, {0, 0}) = 1 (in [0], left {0, 0})
22:05:13.370916 read(0, "", 256)        = 0
22:05:13.371035 gettimeofday({945209113, 371083}, {4294967236, 0}) = 0
22:05:13.371158 ioctl(8, FIONREAD, [0]) = 0
22:05:13.371662 gettimeofday({945209113, 371728}, {4294967236, 0}) = 0
22:05:13.371801 oldselect(1, NULL, NULL, NULL, {0, 1}) = 0 (Timeout)
22:05:13.380392 gettimeofday({945209113, 380459}, {4294967236, 0}) = 0
22:05:13.380534 oldselect(1, NULL, NULL, NULL, {0, 1}) = 0 (Timeout)
22:05:13.390388 gettimeofday({945209113, 390453}, {4294967236, 0}) = 0
Yes, there is no doubt that Quake could be a little nicer, but it's not
even on the top radar on this 400MHz AMD box.
