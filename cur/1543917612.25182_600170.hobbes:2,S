Yes. For the native, "safe_halt" is "sti; hlt". The "native_halt" is
just "hlt". So the para_virt part of "hlt" could be moved to pv_cpu_ops,
and the "sti" part stays in pv_irq_ops.

Okay I understand what you are saying.

Actually my concern was that such misc ops might grow to include the
things don't fit well anywhere else. To me, then pv_lazy_ops (with just
.set_mode) might be better.
