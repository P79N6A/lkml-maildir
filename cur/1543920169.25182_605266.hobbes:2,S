Maybe this:
Allow removal of select from Kconfig files
Difficulty: 4
Many config options depend on other options is unrelated submenus.  As a
result, people have complained about not being able to select the
desired option because they finding all dependencies is too complicated.
Select solves this problem and creates a near-identical new one.  Now it
is just as hard to turn some options _off_ as it was before to turn
others _on_.
The solution would be to have smarter tools that give the user
information roughly like this:
  [ ] CONFIG_FOO
      If you enable this option, you will also enable CONFIG_BAR.
Or :
  [x] CONFIG_BAR
      If you disable this option you will also disable CONFIG_FOO
      and CONFIG_FOO2.
Difficulty is somewhat increased by the number of tools that require
such functionality.  Support for xconfig and menuconfig appears to have
priority as those users have a harder time grepping the kernel.
