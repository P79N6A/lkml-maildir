   I am trying to troubleshoot why in 2.5.13, (Though I also saw this in 2.5.7)
   on my UltraSparc, why my slabcache is broken.  Has anyone else seen this?
The technique used by the slabcache to verify to pointer
is %100 non-portable and totally wrong.
get_user() MUST be used only on "user pointers", it is being
used on a kernel pointer here.
It would work if the access was surrounded by:
	old_fs = get_fs();
	set_fs(KERNEL_DS);
	... get_user(kernel_pointer) ...
	set_fs (old_fs);
But it is not.
