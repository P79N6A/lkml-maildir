We are looking into ways to do this in a way that makes sense, since
there are so many varieties of stackable filesystems out there (e.g.,
gzipfs, unionfs, ecryptfs, etc.), each filesystem having its own
unique characteristics that affect how the ``stackable'' components
take form. This is something we are investigating for the future, but
in the meantime, we would like to have eCryptfs merged in as it is
currently implemented.
