0x4000 is VOLUME_CHKDSK_UNDERWAY.  It means your volume is in the middle 
of having chkdsk run on it.  Do as the driver says: run chkdsk on it and 
mount in Windows and the error will go away and you will be able to mount 
in Linux read/write...
Here is the minimum you have to do:
- Boot windows and log in.
- Open command prompt and type: chkdsk c: /f /v /x
- Windows will ask you if you want to schedule the chkdsk for next reboot.  
Answer yes and reboot.
- Allow chkdsk to run to completion.  Windows will reboot again.
- Boot windows again and log in.
- Open command prompt and type: dir c:\
- Reboot.
The below may be required in some circumstances but may well not be 
necessary so you can try mounting in Linux r/w now and if it still does 
not work then do this:
- Boot into windows _again_ and log in.
- Open command prompt and type: dir c:\
- Reboot.
You should now definitely have cleaned up the volume for Linux to be able 
to mount r/w.
Should it still not work, please let me know but you would be the first 
one for whom the above sequence would not have fixed it...
Best regards,
	Anton
