I guess my machine is cursed. emu10k does not work -- produces no
sound. ens1371 does not work -- is not initialized. usb sound card --
produces no sound.
Now, I tried to break the curse by connecting usb sound card to
another machine... but guess what, still no sound. Connected to second
machine:
root@amd:~# cat /proc/asound/cards
 0 [I82801DBICH4   ]: ICH4 - Intel 82801DB-ICH4
                      Intel 82801DB-ICH4 with AD1981B at 0xc0000c00, irq 5
 1 [U0x4fa0x4201   ]: USB-Audio - USB Device 0x4fa:0x4201
                      USB Device 0x4fa:0x4201 at usb-0000:00:1d.1-2, full speed
root@amd:~#
(usb soundcard clicks when I launch mpg123, but that's it.)
Any ideas?
