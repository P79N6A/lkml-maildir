   Casts are ugly and they hide bugs. There is a fix
   for this problem: make u64 be "unsigned long long"
   for every arch. That works for both 32-bit and 64-bit
   systems. Likewise, choose "unsigned" for u32 even
   if an "unsigned long" would work for a given arch.
That merely hides the lack of user defined printf types
in gcc, it doesn't make the real problem go away.
What you suggest is merely a bandaid.
