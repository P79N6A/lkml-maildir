Either a corrupt log, or a misstated external log, it seems.
Ah, on irc you said only the first part of the uuid was off,
that's a bit odd.  Knowing the actual numbers would be very
helpful.  Perhaps the raid swizzled some bits?

Those numbers may be important, without the real output this isn't very
helpful.

Hm, so the log was in very bad shape.  I don't know how it got there;
it may or may not be xfs's fault, but it shouldn't segfault.  If you have
the core file maybe we can take a look.

Sounds like you've already repaired it and whacked the log, so no use
now.  It would also be interesting to know if any I/O or other errors
occurred in the system before the problems.  You might also run without
the nvidia driver* for a while and see if things go better.
