Subject: [PATCH 3/4] Use the APIC to determine the hardware processor id - x86_64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/4/123

hard_smp_processor_id used to be just a macro that hard-coded
hard_smp_processor_id to 0 in the non SMP case.  When booting non SMP
kernels on hardware where the boot ioapic id is not 0 this turns out to
be a problem.  This is happens frequently in the case of kdump and once
in a great while in the case of real hardware.
Use the APIC to determine the hardware processor id in both UP and SMP
kernels to fix this issue.
Notice that hard_smp_processor_id is only used by SMP code or by code
that works
with apics so we do not need to handle the case when apics are not
present and hard_smp_processor_id should never be called there.
