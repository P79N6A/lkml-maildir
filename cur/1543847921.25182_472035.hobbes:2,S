  Oh, I see. OK.

  Hmm, those traces look really useful. I just have to digest them ;).

  Yes, it should and it seems it really was removed from it at some
point. Only later journal_dirty_data() came and filed it back to the
BJ_SyncData list. And the buffer remained unmapped till the commit time
and then *bang*... It may even be a race in ext3 itself that it called
journal_dirty_data() on an unmapped buffer but I have to read some more
code.
