Look what I've just recieved...
It seems that 2.2 isn't vulnerable after all.

Hi,
our initial posting contains a mistake about the vulnerability of the 2.2
kernel series. Since the 2.2 kernel series doesn't support the
MREMAP_FIXED flag it is NOT vulnerable. The source states
"MREMAP_FIXED option added 5-Dec-1999" but it didn't make into recent
2.2.x. We apologize for inconvenience.
