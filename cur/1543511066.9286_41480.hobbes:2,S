TULIP_SIZE is still defined as 0x400, whereas, for me anyway, it needs
to be 0x80.  Making that change results in detecting the NIC at
eth1-eth7 with outrageous-looking addresses.  While I'm using 2.3.18
I'll probably just define USE_IO_OPS in tulip.c which reverts to the old
behaviour.  I'll await a driver update from Donald.  Actually, in the
nearterm I'll probably download the patch for the pre-release 2.2.13 and
see how that works.
