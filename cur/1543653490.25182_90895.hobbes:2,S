I have a question; "What problem is this supposed to solve?"
This looks like a M$ism to me. Real source trees don't
look like this. If you don't have write access to the source-
code tree, you are screwed on a real project anyway. That's
why we have CVS, tar and other tools to provide a local copy.
Cheers,
