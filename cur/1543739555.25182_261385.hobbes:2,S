It's more likely the BIOS is executing SMM code to handle
the touch pad and that SMM code doesn't have the correct
workaround for the erratum.

The code is already ugly enough and handles most of the cases, 
I don't think it is worth it complicating it even more just
to handle more corner cases of buggy BIOS.
The real fix is to fix your BIOS.

This is dubious because the I/D bit is undefined when NX is disabled
in EFER (e.g. with noexec=off or when the CPU doesn't support NX)
