15 drives == 16 interfaces == 8 channels == 4 controllers
with primary and secondary channel.
He will have groups of about 4 drives on each channel wich
serialize each other due to excessive IRQ line sharing and
master slave issues.
8 x 130MBy/s >>>> PCI bus throughput... I would rather recommend
a classical RAID controller card for this kind of
setup.
The request aliasing effects will be almost for sure disasterous
to overall system performance.
