Because reading argv[0] is not a hack at all.  The location of argv[0]
will never change.  There is no dubious overwriting of argument or
environment string space, and no dubious limits are assumed or broken.

I can't think of any reason why a program needs to change its
environment list.
A clean way, IMO, is to allow a process to write() to
/proc/self/cmdline.  A syscall seems excessive -- the information is
only visible in /proc/PID/cmdline after all.
But an equally clean way, one that's convenient and AFAIK actually works
on some other operating systems is to permit a program to say `argv[0] =
"my new name";'.
