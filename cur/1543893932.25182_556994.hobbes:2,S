Can they modify the software in their device?
Do they pass this right on?

It's not the kernel source.  That's not where the TiVo anti-tampering
machinery blocks modifications.
It's about that copy of the kernel that ships in the device in object
code.  That's the one that TiVo customers ought to be entitled to
modify, if TiVo can modify it itself.

Where it says that you should pass on all the rights that you have.
While TiVo retains the ability to replace, upgrade, fix, break or make
any other change in the GPLed software in the device, it ought to pass
it on to its customers.
