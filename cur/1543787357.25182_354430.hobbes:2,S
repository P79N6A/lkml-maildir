That is probably the root and single cause of quality problems in
companies: Deployment folks (read: sales) set the delivery date (and get
the bonus for selling) and the rest (read: tech folks) have to follow,
no matter what (and get the blame for being late and buggy).
Or why do you think that MSFT has such quite crappy software?

ACK - in the commercial world (and the bigger the company the worse
because sales people are far more distant from the tech people).

Then submit your driver as a (separate) block device in parallel to the
existing SCSI subsystem. People will use it for/with other parts if it
makes sense (and you - as the maintainer - accept their patches). And in
a few years the "old" SCSI core fades out as legacy drives fade out (or
they will happily coexist forever).
The point is: If *you* want it that way, *you* must go that way (and do
not expect others to do it just that *you* get *your* driver merged).
You are the maintainer of the new stuff and (almost) everything will
work as you want.
It might not be the cleanest or most elegant solution in the world, but
if it works, who cares and why?
Where is now the real problem?
I can't see one.
