It would be nice to see what assistance the FreeVMS group may be able to 
offer. It appears that they are attempting to make an operating system 
compatible with VMS based on the Linux kernel.
 From what I have observed, a few of them seem to have extensive 
experience with VMS and may be able to offer at least some baseline 
knowledge as to how VMS accomplishes this.
My curiosity lies with the ability to run FreeVMS on VAX....
(Why not? It's just a hobby....)
