Hm, I reported what looks like a similar problem some time ago. At least the 
symptom, but not what caused it. Though I didn't get an oops.
See my previous mail: 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0312.2/0792.html
Also got "ide-scsi: Strange, packet command initiated yet DRQ isn't asserted" 
and afaict this happened the first time since I used 2.4.23. Maybe it is the 
same problem?
If you got an oops you should probably post it. After running through ksymoops 
of course. :)
Bye,
Oliver
