ugh.  Most of these look real.
AFAICT fs/sysv/itree.c:find_shared is innocent.
fs/nfsd/nfsproc.c:nfsd_proc_link is a bit obscure.  There's a bug in a
callee of nfsd_proc_link(): nfsd_link() can forget to do an fh_unlock() on
an error path (the goto out_nfserr).  Is that what the tool is referring
to?
Anyway, I've enumerated these 109 bugs and placed a couple of text files at
   
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/stanford-locking-bugs/
so we can keep track of which of these possible bugs has been fixed or
otherwise disposed of.
If people could track the bugs by those identifiers, that would help.  I
fixed err1-10 and err1-25.
If someone wants to volunteer to maintain this list, that would be nice.
