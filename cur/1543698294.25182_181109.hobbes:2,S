Because new hardware requires newest kernel, and neither I, nor the
majority of the users out there have the knowledge to 'forward' apply
patches.
Even if 2.4 is phasing out, the process has just begun and it will last
a lot until 2.6 will be ready for production systems.
We are not talking about a fancy, experimental feature. We are talking
about a mature, serious project, that has been traveling for 3 years
along the 2.4 kernel and with even more years of testing and research
behind. I find it just pitty for the linux kernel not to include it.
When going to a conference, you don't present the brand new stuff you
have just computed or measured the night before, because you just can't
know if it is correct or not. Instead, you will present older, but
mature work, that you can swear on. The same with the 2.6 kernel.
Everybody is pushing it in front, but no one is using it for production
systems. XFS and 2.4 are, even together, old, mature work, that anybody
would 'present' anywhere.

Ionut
