During the discussion some people like Erich Focht and Ram mentioned
that this information can be useful for them. I remember that Erich had
in mind something like cluster-wide pid tracking in user space. 
When I wrote "several user space applications" it was just to say that
this fork connector is not designed only for ELSA and fork information
is available to every listeners.
