Hi,
    I developed a kernel module. Within that i am
dynamically allocating memory(using kmalloc and
vmalloc) for a buffer to read data. After that while
trying to read into this buffer from the hard disk
using sys_read i am getting an error. And the same
error i am getting while writing into another buffer,
which was allocated in the same way, using sys_write.
The error number set is -14(EFAULT) i.e., Bad address.
   Give me any idea to resolve the problem.
  If anyone help me i am gretful to them.
Thanks & Regards
