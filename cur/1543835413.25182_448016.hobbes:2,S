Some comments from a MMC/SD perspective.
On a general note, please replace all your constants with defines. Magic
values are no fun (unless they are in fact a magic number ;)).
Also, calling the struct "card" might be a bit misleading as it might be
a bus in the MMC case.
In tifm_sd_o_flags(), try not to case on response types as the hardware
shouldn't have to care about this. If you really, really, _really_ must
do this, then make sure you have a default that prints something nasty
and fails the request with an error.
A default is also needed for cmd_flags in the same function.
In tifm_sd_exec(), you should only need to test for the presence of
cmd->data, not that the command is of ADTC type.
Rgds
