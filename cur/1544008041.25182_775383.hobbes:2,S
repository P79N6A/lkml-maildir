That's basically why I want this to go into the v4l-dvb repository: this 
makes it easier for people to start working with it. It doesn't affect 
existing drivers, except for the i2c driver changes and those changes 
are just transforming a big switch to a set of functions. So I really 
consider this a pretty low-risk merge.
If someone is willing to do some testing with my tree in the next two 
weeks then I don't mind waiting, but it's been in development now from 
early September (if not earlier) and been reviewed several times. In 
addition, ivtv has been modified to work with it and that driver uses 
more sub-devices by far than any other driver.
I don't know what more I can do, to be honest.
Regards,
	Hans
