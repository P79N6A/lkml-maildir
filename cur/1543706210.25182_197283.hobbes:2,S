Morning!
What Linux supported filesystems support UTF-8 filenames?
Looks like at least xfs and reiserfs are not able of handling them,
as Apache with UTF-8 as default charset delievers wrong names, when
accessing files with German umlauts.
Is it somehow planned to enable it?
Or are you waiting for patches which do that job?
Greetings,
Nico
