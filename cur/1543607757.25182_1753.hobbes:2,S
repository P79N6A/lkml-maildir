Gcc won't guarantee that it puts different variables adjacently - the
linker (or even the compiler) can move things around to make them fit
better. Which is why it would be better to use the separate section trick.
(The union trick Juergen uses obviously also works around this, but
requires that the _users_ be aware of what kind of lock it is, which I
don't particularly like - then you can't just change the lock, you have to
change the users too).
