It's a solution, and it more or less fixes things without any changes
to userspace, which is nice. I still prefer my patch in
<20060827083438.GA6931@var.cx> though, possibly with modifications so
it doesn't affect all timespec users but only nanosleep (we'd have to
check if the other timespec users aren't converting to ktime_t). 
With this patch, we sleep shorter than specified, and don't signal
this in any way. Returning EINVAL for anything except negative tv_sec
or invalid tv_nsec breaks the spec too, but I prefer errors to
silently sleeping too short.
I'll grant this is more of an aesthetic point than something that'll
cause real-world problems (300 years is a long time for any sleep),
but if things break I like them to do so as loudly as possible, as a
general rule.
