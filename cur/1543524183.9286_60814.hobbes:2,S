     Of course the application check for errors, but the error always
   occur in the first recvfrom. The application doesn't change any
   socket property, so I assume it is on blocking mode.
     The sequence is: socket, bind, select,recvfrom. No one uses any
   extra param.
Right, and if recvfrom returns an error, the sockaddr structure
holds garbage.  It's contents cannot be relied upon, and what
I get from your report is that the sockaddr passed to recvfrom
is the same one which gets passed to sendto/sendmsg.  That is
wrong, and is what causes the problem.  The application in question
needs to be fixed if this is the case.
