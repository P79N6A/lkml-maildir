Are those 80-ribbon cables by themselves marked/keyed in any way?
If so, the chip set would need support to read the key.
If not so (which I assume), you cannot tell if you have the proper cable
unless you transfer data and trash it. 
You might try to actively probe (like reading inquiry data at UDMA/16
and UDMA/66 and compare it), but this may succeed, while subsequent
transfers fail. You never know. 
High-frequency technology requires care and thought. It's not about just
switching DC on and off. There's more to it.
