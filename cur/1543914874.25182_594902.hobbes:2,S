Why am I not surprised? :)

My approach is to have one for mount points and ramfs/tmpfs/sysfs/etc.
which are pinned for their entire lifetime and another for regular
files/inodes.  One could take a three-way approach and have
always-pinned, often-pinned and rarely-pinned.
We won't get never-pinned that way.
