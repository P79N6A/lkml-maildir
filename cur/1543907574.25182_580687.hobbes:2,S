Servicing I/O over the network requires an allocation to send a buffer
and an allocation to later receive the acknowledgement. We can't free
our send buffer (or the memory it's supposed to clean) until the
relevant ack is received. We have to hold our reserves privately
throughout, even if an interrupt that wants to do GFP_ATOMIC
allocation shows up in-between.

By the point that this patch is relevant, there are already no clean
pages. The only way to free up more memory is via I/O.
