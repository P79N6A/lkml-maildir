I should possibly have mentioned that APM is enabled on this machine,
but no suspend/standby had been done, it's only for use in power-cuts
when I want to minimise draw from the UPS batteries.
The machine is an athlon desktop.
I'll see if I can reproduce this with 2.4.11, 2.4.10 is utterly unusable
for me. (totally insane swapping out causing things to get killed on 
significant reading.
