It is.  I have done it several times.  Just rm -rf all of the
arches that you don't use.  Also, rm -rf any other subdirs to
which you know you won't enable any features.  For example, no
SCSI, rm -rf the scsi dir.  Works for me...

As above, it does that now for me, and I'm using official
tarballs.

I think that due to the kernel's modularity right now, the end
user doesn't have much of a need for recompiling a kernel, nor
should they.  More technical users do though, and also
businesses, and other special purpose machines/users may want to
recompile the kernel too.  This comes with some requirements, one
of which is disk space.  In order to untar the kernel so that you
can remove the stuff that you don't want, you need the space to
untar it allready.  If you can do that, then you can allready
remove unnecessary parts.
Someone has allready created scripts which allow you to build a
kernel from ALLREADY compressed sources by manually uncompressing
one at a time.  It was a while back I saw it though, so you might
need to hunt it down.  Also, it came with a compilation speed
penalty that was quite drastic.

One could find that out by trying it first.  ;o)  Works here.
