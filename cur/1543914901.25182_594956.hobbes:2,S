I don't say the group should never be mixed. The movable objects could
be moved out on demand. If 64k get allocated then up to 64k get
moved. That would reduce the impact as the kernel does not hang while
it moves 2MB or even 1GB. It also allows objects to be freed and the
space reused in the unmovable and mixed groups. There could also be a
certain number or percentage of mixed groupd be allowed to further
increase the chance of movable objects freeing themself from mixed
groups.
But when you already have say 10% of the ram in mixed groups then it
is a sign the external fragmentation happens and some time should be
spend on moving movable objects.

In your sample graphics you had 1152 groups. Reserving a few of those
doesnt sound too bad. And how many migrate types do we talk about. So
far we only had movable and unmovable. I would split unmovable into
short term (caches, I/O pages) and long term (task structures,
dentries). Reserving 6 groups for schort term unmovable and long term
unmovable would be 1% of ram in your situation.
Maybe instead of reserving one could say that you can have up to 6
groups of space not used by unmovable objects before aggressive moving
starts. I don't quite see why you NEED reserving as long as there is
enough space free alltogether in case something needs moving. 1 group
worth of space free might be plenty to move stuff too. Note that all
the virtual pages can be stuffed in every little free space there is
and reassembled by the MMU. There is no space lost there.
But until one tries one can't say.

PS: How do allocations pick groups? Could one use the oldest group
dedicated to each MIGRATE_TYPE? Or lowest address for unmovable and
highest address for movable? Something to better keep the two out of
each other way.
