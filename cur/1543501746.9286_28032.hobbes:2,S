Unfortunately, no. The 'Interceptors' allows to safely intercept *existing*
syscall.
And this is why: Let us say,
    - The kernel 2.3.121 has 300 syscalls.
    - The tv.o module registers the syscall NR_TURN_ON_TV = 310
    - The tetris.o module registers the syscall NR_GET_BONUS = 310
Then you can not use TV and tetris card in one time :-(.
To safely register new function, the kernel requires some sort of naming
service.
It's still possible to use wrapper:
        register_syscall("Tetris bonus game", &handler);
in the kernel and
        get_syscall_number("Tetris bonus game");
in libc.
But this is already new mechanism - not regular syscalls!
So, instead, I have another proposal: new driver system !!!
We need it!  Do you agree?
Continued in "[RFD] new driver system" :-)
                        Best regards.
                                    Alexander.
