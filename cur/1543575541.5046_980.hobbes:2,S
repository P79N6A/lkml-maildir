Two points: (1) gcc 2.95 makes slightly slower code than egcs-1.1
(according to benchmarks on gcc.gnu.org) so compile 2.4 kernel with
egcs for a fairer comparison. (2) The new VM was a performance
regression for throughput.
I think that it is important that the extent of the indisputable
performance decreases be quantified and traced. For me there was a
subjective performance peak around 2.3.48 IIRC, though it might have
been before. Andrea Archangeli has a VM patch that seems to
help in some cases.
It would be interesting to run a series of (automated) tests on a lot
of kernel versions, and to see how far performance is behind FreeBSD
(or even NetBSD).
