Actually I think /dev/console is (at least if you dont use serial console)
only a alias for a virtual console, therefore it can send signals. I guess
the break char is simply not set to ^C. use stty to set break to ^c and then
save the settings to ioctl.save. This will be restored by init. Or if you
want to avoid init, set stty by hand.
