A look at /proc/*/oom_score might shed some light on the "at random" part.
I.e., doing
  for job in /proc/[0-9]* ; do \
    echo -e "`cat $job/oom_score` \t $job \t `head -c50 $job/cmdline`"; \
  done | sort -n
the last process listed is considered the biggest memory hog of the 
moment (Of course, this still does not tell _why_).
