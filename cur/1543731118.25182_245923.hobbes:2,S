Personally I think the latter is a good thing as it encourages better coding, and the former is something we'll have with any alternate design.
Well ... it'd be nice to know what nicksched was trying to fix. Then maybe
we could try to measure it. There's lots of stuff in the changelog about
what technical stuff was fiddled with ... but nothing I can see about what
it was meant to acheive.

The only feedback on nickshed was that it hurt NUMA somewhat, SMT interactivity was broken (an easy enough oversight), and I did not comment to avoid giving biased criticism.
The main thing I liked about staircase was it seemed to simplify things.
Having mere mortals comprehend the code seems like a Good Plan (tm).
The fact that it seemed to bounce tasks around a crapload less was a nice
bonus ;-) Cache is king.
