But there seems to be still an AVL tree in there?

So what are its drawbacks compared to slab/kmalloc? 
Also if it really performs that much better it might be a good
idea to replace all of kmalloc() with it, but doing that
would require a lot more benchmarks with various workloads
and small and big machines first.
