it will take me a little bit of time to do this. the one I've been working 
with is now my desktop at work, now that the holidays are over I need to 
work with it instead of rebooting it, the other boxes are in a stack at 
home. getting at them is easy compared to figuring out where to set them 
up. I should have something setup within a couple of days.
