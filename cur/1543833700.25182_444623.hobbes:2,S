You are still using the wrong abstraction. Data that is not global to
the entire machine has absolutely _no_ place being put into the
superblock. It doesn't matter if it is process-specific,
container-specific or whatever-else-specific, it will still be vetoed.
If your real problem is uid/gid mapping on top of generic filesystems,
then have you looked into the *BSD solution of using a stackable
filesystem (i.e. umapfs)?
