WHAT??? 2 log(sqrt(n)), please (assuming as you apparently did that depth
is divided evenly).
	Hans, sorry, but it's plainly bogus - "trees" in structured
files/bundles/whatever are attached to *leaves* of the large tree. And if
you are thinking of the allocation metadata of the underlying file - how
deep is it going to be? You are spending most of the time doing actual
file data IO, not the tree traversals. And data IO is *not* going to see
the intermediate level at all.

Translate it, please.
