	The LFS specification defined  loff_t for 64-bit offset value.
	The   ssize_t  will not change.

	ReiserFS: Propably works
	EXT2:     works
	Coda:     Not (local cache issues, protocol is ok.)
	UFS:      works (although not complete vs. O_LARGEFILE flag use.)
	NFSv2:    protocol is limited to 2G-1
	NFSv3:    protocol is ok, not sure of Linux implementation status.
	SAMBA:	  works (but linux kernel SMBFS might be another story)
