That begs the question: do we trust that nobody but the kernel will send
packets to a NETLINK_KERROR socket?  Ordinary users can't, but any root
application can.  Without kerror_netlink_rcv(), such packets don't get
dequeued.

We include log_kmagic and log_kversion so the receiving app (e.g. the evlog
daemon) can figure out which version of the kernel header it's getting.  Note
that we're up to #3 (going on #4, with the changes you and others have
suggested).  As long as we have to include log_kmagic and log_kversion, they
need to be first.
That said, I get the impression that people would be more comfortable if
log_facility[] were moved to the end.  Other than that, can anybody point
out a specific area where there's likely to be an alignment problem?  The
various members' offsets are the same on i386, ppc32, and ppc64.  This should
also be true for s390 and s390x.  I'd think it'd really matter only when kernel
and user on the same system are different architectures.  ppc64K/ppc32U,
at least, works.

Thanks for the pointer.  Looks nice.  If performance turns out to be an issue
(e.g., if for some reason people want to cc all printk messages through this
interface), I'll keep that in mind.
