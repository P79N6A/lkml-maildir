Not having auto discovery for that kind of thing disturbs me.  But
if you can discover what you must do and then the policy is about
what you can do it I guess I'm fine with that.

That sounds sane.  With that you can at least do NFS style caching 
with a lot of stat calls to verify your cache is coherent and by
implementing it as a write-through cache you can even do a halfway
decent job of being cache coherent.  Which is probably about the
best you can do with the current unix API.
With a write-through cache you can likely achieve the same
semantic effect of totally not caching a file with an appropriate
number of stat calls.  Not caching some files will like yield 
I suggest you document the quid.vers == 0 magic for an uncachable
file, so future interoperability is assured.
