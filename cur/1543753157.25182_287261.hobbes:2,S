Patched + removed VESAFB from config.
The mtrr patch in 
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77674
 appears 
to fixes the problem.  No further mtrr debug outputs occurred.   Clean 
boot output now for 2.6.10-r4 + mtrr-debug.patch.
Will try again with VESAFB re-enabled and post further results @ 
bugs.gentoo.org (if any).
THX!
Steve
