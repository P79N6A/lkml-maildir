Unless esd has ever gotten fixed, esd doesn't handle errors or write() 
return values.
Some sound cards can't handle the flood of data and only accept so many 
bytes at a time.  Esd does a write of 4K, only 2387 bytes (this is an 
example) are actually written.  Esd doesn't pay attention to this and 
starts writing with the next 4K chunk.  This leads to the skips.
On slow machines or slow kernels you don't notice this (as much), on 
faster stuff, it's very apparent.
For what it's worth, there is hardly any error checking at all in esd.
