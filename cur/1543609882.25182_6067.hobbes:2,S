Yes. One cpu is generally right below the power supply so the airflow is
obstructed or something, and it runs warmer than cpu0. Everyone's s2460 is
like this.
temp1:     +41.0 C  (limit =   +2 C, hysteresis =  +64 C) sensor = 3904 transistor
temp2:       +39 C  (limit =  +80 C, hysteresis =  +75 C) sensor = 3904 transistor
temp3:       +42 C  (limit =  +80 C, hysteresis =  +75 C) sensor = 3904 transistor
