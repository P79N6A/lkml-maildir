If we're going to go that far, why not use a better coloring algorithm?
IIRC linear_page_index(vma, vaddr) % MAX_NR_NODES has issues with
various semiregular access patterns where others do not (most are
relatively simple hash functions). This reminds me that getting the vma
and vaddr accessible to the allocator helps with normal page coloring.
