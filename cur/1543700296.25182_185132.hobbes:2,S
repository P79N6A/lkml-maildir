Update: Underclocked from 1.8G to 1.2G (whups, meant to go down only
2-300mhz) and its been vaguely stable for about 1.5 days.  I don't have
another week (yet..) to run it under its normal load and wait for a
crash, so what I'm going to do is:
 - Move the workload (web/mail/..) to a different machine so this one
can be down for an extended period
 - Replace the ram with new sticks (they arrived this morning)
 - Reclock everything to stock (1.83G cpu, 200mhz ram and verify the
timings from kingston)
 - Replace the video card
 - Memtest86 until it cries
 - If it passes, bonnie++ on the new drives
 - If that passes, usb/acpi/apic testing with the associated patches
Anyone still watching this?  Tips and suggestions on what else might be
useful/informative are more than welcome.  The tests above mostly
replicate what I did when building this box, and it passed them then..
Recap:
 Epox 8rda+ nforce2 mobo
 AMD Athlon XP 2500+ (Barton) 1.83G
 Kingston HyperX PC3200
 WD Caviar WD1200JB 8M/UDMA100
 Antec case w/ 350W AMD-certified PSU
Oopses and occasional hangs, usually in do_generic_file_read, using
stock kernel.org 2.4.2x kernels.  Hardware passed testing (memtest86,
bonnie++) before I put Linux on it.
