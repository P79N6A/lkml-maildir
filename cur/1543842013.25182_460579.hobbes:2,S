Subject: [PATCH] BC: resource beancounters (v4) (added user memory)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Core Resource Beancounters (BC) + kernel/user memory control.
BC allows to account and control consumption
of kernel resources used by group of processes.
Draft UBC description on OpenVZ wiki can be found at
http://wiki.openvz.org/UBC_parameters
The full BC patch set allows to control:
- kernel memory. All the kernel objects allocatable
on user demand should be accounted and limited
for DoS protection.
E.g. page tables, task structs, vmas etc.
- virtual memory pages. BCs allow to
limit a container to some amount of memory and
introduces 2-level OOM killer taking into account
container's consumption.
pages shared between containers are correctly
charged as fractions (tunable).
- network buffers. These includes TCP/IP rcv/snd
buffers, dgram snd buffers, unix, netlinks and
other buffers.
- minor resources accounted/limited by number:
tasks, files, flocks, ptys, siginfo, pinned dcache
mem, sockets, iptentries (for containers with
virtualized networking)
As the first step we want to propose for discussion
the most complicated parts of resource management:
kernel memory and virtual memory.
The patch set to be sent provides core for BC and
management of kernel memory only. Virtual memory
management will be sent in a couple of days.
The patches in these series are:
diff-atomic-dec-and-lock-irqsave.patch
 introduce atomic_dec_and_lock_irqsave()
diff-bc-kconfig.patch:
 Adds kernel/bc/Kconfig file with UBC options and
 includes it into arch Kconfigs
diff-bc-core.patch:
 Contains core functionality and interfaces of BC:
 find/create beancounter, initialization,
 charge/uncharge of resource, core objects' declarations.
diff-bc-task.patch:
 Contains code responsible for setting BC on task,
 it's inheriting and setting host context in interrupts.
 Task contains three beancounters:
 1. exec_bc  - current context. all resources are charged
               to this beancounter.
 2. fork_bc  - beancounter which is inherited by
               task's children on fork
diff-bc-syscalls.patch:
 Patch adds system calls for BC management:
 1. sys_get_bcid    - get current BC id
 2. sys_set_bcid    - changes exec_ and fork_ BCs on current
 3. sys_set_bclimit - set limits for resources consumtions
 4. sys_get_bcstat  - returns limits/usages/fails for BC
diff-bc-kmem-core.patch:
 Introduces BC_KMEMSIZE resource which accounts kernel
 objects allocated by task's request.
 Objects are accounted via struct page and slab objects.
 For the latter ones each slab contains a set of pointers
 corresponding object is charged to.
 Allocation charge rules:
 1. Pages - if allocation is performed with __GFP_BC flag - page
    is charged to current's exec_bc.
 2. Slabs - kmem_cache may be created with SLAB_BC flag - in this
    case each allocation is charged. Caches used by kmalloc are
    created with SLAB_BC | SLAB_BC_NOCHARGE flags. In this case
    only __GFP_BC allocations are charged.
diff-bc-kmem-charge.patch:
 Adds SLAB_BC and __GFP_BC flags in appropriate places
 to cause charging/limiting of specified resources.
diff-bc-vmlocked-core.patch:
Introduces new resource BC_LOCKEDPAGES for accounting
of mlock-ed user pages.
diff-bc-vmlocked-charge.patch:
Places calls to BC core over the kernel to charge locked memory.
diff-bc-privvm.patch:
This patch instroduces new resource - BC_PRIVVMPAGES.
Privvmpages acointing is described in details in
http://wiki.openvz.org/User_pages_accounting
diff-bc-vmrss-prep.patch:
This patch intruduces small preparations for vmrss accounting
to make reviewing simpler.
diff-bc-vmrss-core.patch:
This is the core of vmrss accounting.
Pages are accounted in fractions and it is described in details in
http://wiki.openvz.org/RSS_fractions_accounting
diff-bc-vmrss-charge.patch:
Calls to vmrss core code over the kernel to do accounting.
Summary of changes from v3 patch set:
* Added basic user pages accounting (lockedpages/privvmpages)
* spell in Kconfig
* Makefile reworked
* EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
* union w/o name in struct page
* bc_task_charge is void now
* adjust minheld/maxheld splitted
Summary of changes from v2 patch set:
* introduced atomic_dec_and_lock_irqsave()
* bc_adjust_held_minmax comment
* added __must_check for bc_*charge* funcs
* use hash_long() instead of own one
* bc/Kconfig is sourced from init/Kconfig now
* introduced bcid_t type with comment from Alan Cox
* check for barrier <= limit in sys_set_bclimit()
* removed (bc == NULL) checks
* replaced memcpy in beancounter_findcrate with assignment
* moved check 'if (mask & BC_ALLOC)' out of the lock
* removed unnecessary memset()
Summary of changes from v1 patch set:
* CONFIG_BEANCOUNTERS is 'n' by default
* fixed Kconfig includes in arches
* removed hierarchical beancounters to simplify first patchset
* removed unused 'private' pointer
* removed unused EXPORTS
* MAXVALUE redeclared as LONG_MAX
* beancounter_findcreate clarification
* renamed UBC -> BC, ub -> bc etc.
* moved BC inheritance into copy_process
* introduced reset_exec_bc() with proposed BUG_ON
* removed task_bc beancounter (not used yet, for numproc)
* fixed syscalls for sparc
* added sys_get_bcstat(): return info that was in /proc
* cond_syscall instead of #ifdefs
Many thanks to Oleg Nesterov, Alan Cox, Matt Helsley and others
for patch review and comments.
Patch set is applicable to 2.6.18-rc5-mm1
Thanks,
Kirill
