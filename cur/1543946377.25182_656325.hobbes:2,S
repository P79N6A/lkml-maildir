Hmmm - interesting.  I'm not good enough with the kernel startup
sequence to know what it might be waiting for.  I don't see any problem
with a longer wait other than perhaps delaying the kernel startup.  We
left it a module and never really worked with it linked into the kernel,
primarily because its performance can be dependant on the work load, and
some folks will want the flexibility that a module gives.  We didn't let
it autoload at boot time for a similar reason.
If you want it to autoload at boot, you might want to add a modprobe
command to an init script.
