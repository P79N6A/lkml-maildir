I agree with David.  The GPL isn't free software it is "open" software,
it wants all the changes to be done out in the open.  Which is perfectly
fine, one can look at the BSD history and the Linux history and argue that
the GPL is what made Linux the "winner".  But GPLed software isn't free, it
is software with an agenda, a noble agenda in many opinions (including mine),
of allowing everyone to benefit from the work and enhancements of the work.
Not everyone likes this, however.  The BK license took a lot of heat for the
fact that we reserved the right to force your repositories out in the open
(because it became clear that some people were using the BK commercially and
not paying license fees).  Even though we were saying "it's free if you are
working out in the open" some free software developers felt that was too 
much (it occurs to me as I'm writing this that what the license should say
is that we can force you to open the repos if and only if the changes have
been pulled to another repo - that would finess security feature problem).
