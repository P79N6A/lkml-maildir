We'll start merging it up after 2.6.0.  It'll be quite a lot of work,
actually - a lot of things have been parked in -mm for some time and may
not have had sufficiently wide testing, especially on non-i386.  I need to
ask the originators and others to re-review and retest some things.

I guess I'll keep -mm going until there's a reason not to.
