Then open O_RDONLY (with CAP_SYS_RAWIO).  Then the utility won't have
write access.  If that's all you are worried about.
or.
If you have only one capability (CAP_SYS_RAWIO), you are not owner of
/dev/kmem, you are in group kmem, and /dev/kmem is 0640, then all you will
get is read-only access to /dev/kmem.  This does not require kernel changes.
