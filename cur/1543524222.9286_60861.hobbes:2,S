Ignore the OSS complaint.
If your sound is distorted, make sure you do not have an IRQ conflict or
similar BIOS problem.
Next, try version 1.1.2, available at
http://gtf.org/garzik/drivers/via82cxxx/
   or in recent 2.3.x kernels.
It includes some fixes which help out a lot of people.
If that still doesn't work, my advice is patience.  I am working on a
native driver which removes te SB emulation support and sounds a LOT
better.  It should be released at Linux Expo or immediately afterwards.
I have a K7M motherboard at home to test with, so your configuration
will definitely be supported.
