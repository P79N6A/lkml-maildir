strange, it still works flawlessly here with your .config :
egrep 'dummy|shaper' /tmp/test/lib/modules/2.4.24/modules.dep 
/lib/modules/2.4.24/kernel/drivers/net/dummy.o:
/lib/modules/2.4.24/kernel/drivers/net/shaper.o:
I have depmod 2.4.22i, gcc 2.95.3, ld 2.12.1 if this can help.
Have you tried without modules versionning ?
