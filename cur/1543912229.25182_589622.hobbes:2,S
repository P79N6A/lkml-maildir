Subject: [PATCH] Add a "rounddown_pow_of_two" routine to log2.h.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/29/50

To go along with the existing "roundup_pow_of_two" routine, add one
for rounding down since that operation appears to crop up on a regular
basis in the source tree.

  some brief tests indicate that these routines return the correct
answer.  i'm not sure if i've officially submitted this before or if
it's already been accepted in a tree somewhere.
