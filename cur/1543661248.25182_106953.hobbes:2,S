hmmm.  I've attached the latest tg3, version 1.4, which I just sent off 
to Marcelo.  It includes some fixes that may affect your 5701.
Can you try two things?
1) 2.4.21-pre4 + tg3 v1.4
2) 2.4.20 + tg3 v1.4
I'm interested to know if you can reproduce with the latest driver in 
either of these two scenarios...
