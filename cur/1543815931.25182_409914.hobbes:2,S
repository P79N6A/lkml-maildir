Ok well if we're going to run with this set of changes then we need to assess 
the affect of each change and splitting them up into separate patches would 
be appropriate normally anyway. That will allow us to track down which 
particular patch causes it. That won't mean we will turn down the change 
based on that one result, though, it will just help us understand it better.
Cheers,
