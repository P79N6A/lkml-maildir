    yep i agree - in this case a receivefile() implementation would

    pagecache and VFS point of view, it's just not there yet), thus
    you could receivefile() your data into a temporary file, and
    sendfile() it to the other card, without ever touching data. This
    is faster than any zero-copy read()/write(), because it can do
    things straight in the pagecache, without having to deal with
    user-space page mappings.
Why not something like lm's splice?
