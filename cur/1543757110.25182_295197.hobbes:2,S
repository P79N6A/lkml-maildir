In the interest of the size of everyone's inboxes, I mentioned to Ray
that we might move this discussion to a smaller forum while we resolve
some of the outstanding issues.  Ray's going to post a followup to to
linux-mm, and trim the cc list down.  So, if you're still interested,
keep your eyes on linux-mm and we'll continue there.
