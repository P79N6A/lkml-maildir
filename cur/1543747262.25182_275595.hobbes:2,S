I object sternuously to your "the header files". If you can't even say 
_which_ header file, I'm not interested.
If you can say "these X header files have this specific problem Y, and if 
we move part Z into a common area A, we'd solve it because B", that's a 
different matter.
See what I'm saying? Whole-sale "move things around because we want to" 
I'm not interested in. Specific problems, yes.

No. I told you why it cannot and MUST NOT be done. Repeat after me:
	WE MUST NOT POLLUTE THE NAMESPACE!
There are many cases where including a header file means you want the
structure, but it does _not_ mean that you can expose totally unrelated 
types, even if those types happen to be used as part of the structure. See 
what I'm saying?
In contrast, __u8/__u16/__xxx are explicitly defined by the relevant 
standards to be "system name space", and that is _exactly_ why we don't 
use the standard namespaces.
And the fact is, the rules for _when_ you export _which_ standard types
are just too damn hard, and more importantly, they are not something that
the kernel headers should even be deciding. They depend on glibc internal
things like __USE_BSD etc, and they depend on which standard you compile
for, and sometimes even on which _version_ of the standard you compile
for.
I will not have that mess in the kernel. Which means that we do _not_ 
export any of the standard names. Which means that we can't _use_ any of 
them. End of story.
