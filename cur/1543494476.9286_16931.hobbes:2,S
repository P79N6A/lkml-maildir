Now, I want a sample of the stuff *you* are smoking. Maybe it will make me
see the beauty in EMACS, IRS, INS, advocates and lusers ;-)

Yup. I would hate to see SplashSnotters running amok and filling Ken's
mailbox with (ahem) indignant (ahem) replies. As for the anit-MS backlash
- it's a troubling thing. There are imbecils for whom Linux is exactly
that - would-be-Windows-not-from-MS. IMHO we could live without them. They
will eventually go away to pester somebody else (methink their next
target will be FreeBSD), but I'ld rather see them leaving ASAP. Not going
to happen yet. Sigh...
