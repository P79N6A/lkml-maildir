I know this user-defined region needs address space handler, but your
address space handler below  is so weird that make me doubt
the correctness.  The example of address space handler is:
ec.c : acpi_ec_space_handler
I suggest LCD support in hotkey.c like:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=6843&action=view
Implement device ASIM  in a separate driver to support user-defined
address space handler.
Config userspace acpi daemon to respond events by evoking
LCD._BCM with command:
	echo -n xx > /sys/hotkey/brightness.
If you do these, then the only specific thing would be ASIM.
Thanks,
Luming
