Actually I suspect that "restrict" makes little difference for inlines 
or even statics, since gcc generally can do alias analysis fine there. 
However, in the presence of an intermodule function call, all alias 
analysis is off.  This is presumably why type-based analysis is used at 
all ... to at least be able to a modicum of, say, loop invariant removal 
in the presence of a library call.  This is also where "restrict" comes 
into play.
