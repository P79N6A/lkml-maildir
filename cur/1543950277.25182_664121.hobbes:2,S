I almost flagged this earlier, but I don't think we've ever seen an LSM 
with a longer name, and it can be expanded if needed.  32 or something 
seems similarly arbitrary.

Theoretically, security_module_enable() could be called at any time, 
although it does seem unlikely never to be called at boot, especially if 
multiple LSMs are compiled in.
In that case, perhaps mark the function as __init, and require it be 
called only at boot time.

With the above, yes.

Indeed :-)
