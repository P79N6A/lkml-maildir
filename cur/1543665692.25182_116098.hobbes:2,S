Hello,
I don't know if this is a kernel issue, but since I have a pb with one
kernel and not the other, I assume it is... Please don't flame.
I am trying to have a small distro that uses ramdisk for its partitions
that need rw access, and the cd for the rest. Part of the script
(slurped from boot-cd hint from linux from scratch) consists in copying
over from the cd to the ramdisk these partitions (script in app-1).
The behavior depend on the kernel... after the last mount, with 2.5 the
fake/needwrite directory doesn't contain anything, whereas with 2.4.20
it does contain what I put in it. And I think it is related, but with
2.5, I never get into run level 1 or 2 or 3, it just hangs after the
last script in rcsysinit.d., whereas 2.4.20 slides smoothly into
whatever inittab tells him to.
Do I need extra modules in 2.5?
(Note that the size of 2.4 is ~ 930k, where as 2.5 is 1.5M)
Thx for any suggestion.
Matt

#!/bin/sh
dev_ram=/dev/ram0
dir_ramdisk=/fake/ramdisk

        start)
                echo -n "Creating ext2fs on $dev_ram ...              "
                /sbin/mke2fs -m 0 -i 1024 -q $dev_ram > /dev/null 2>&1
                evaluate_retval
                sleep 1
                echo -n "Mounting ramdisk on $dir_ramdisk ...         "
                mount -n $dev_ram $dir_ramdisk

                cp -dpR $dir_needwrite/* $dir_ramdisk > /dev/null 2>&1
                evaluate_retval
                sleep 1
                echo -n "Remount ramdisk to $dir_needwrite ...        "
                umount -n $dir_ramdisk > /dev/null 2>&1
                sleep 1
                mount -n $dev_ram $dir_needwrite
                sleep 1
                ;;
        *)
                echo "Usage: $0 {start}"
                exit 1
