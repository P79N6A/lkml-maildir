I'd like to delta compress the addresses as well. I think the way to
do this is to change the address table to be sparsed by a factor of 16
or 32 or so, with pointers into the stem table. The pointers are
chosen to land us on stems of length 0 so we don't have to do any
backtracking. Then in addition to stem length, we keep a 16-bit
address delta. 
So we do a binary (or linear) search on the reduced address table, hop
into the stem table, and iterate along as before until we find our
symbol. Even if we stick with linear search on the address table,
we've sped up the search by 32x. So now we have nearly random access
into the stem table and for 15000 symbols, we'll save on the order of
30k (and 90k on 64-bit!).
We can also drop the nulls from the end of the ascii strings and look
for termination by finding the next stem code (hopefully always in the
control character range). This should be worth another 15k.
