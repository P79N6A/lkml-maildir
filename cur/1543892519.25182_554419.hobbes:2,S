I meant, caller specifically selects the feature, on a per-fd basis. If 
you select the task flag runtime, then all the allocated fds will be in 
the non-sequential area. Even fds allocated inside the library code, with 
libraries not expecting this. I fail to understand how a linker can nicely 
solve this. If my app is using, for its own reasons, fds in the 
non-sequential area, and library XYZ internally uses fds and does not like 
them in that area, I still want to link to that library. As long as I do 
not pass my fds to the library ("XYZ internally .."), this must still 
work. The contrary is also true. If my app is not non-sequential fd aware, 
and my library wants to use them in order to keep them alive from apps 
doing the for-each-fd-close loop, with a per-fd policy, you can still mix 
them together.
Or are you planning to have two sets of each userspace (userspace is not 
only glibc, there's other stuff too) libraries?
