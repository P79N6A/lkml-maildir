I follow your post last year, and made it to adaptive to relocatable kernel.
for x86_64 head.S
you are using _KERNPG_TABLE + _PAGE_USER
and i found out it it is _PAGE_TABLE.===> otherwise initrd can not be loaded.
for other code for i386, you may need to dig and repost it.
for code in early_printk.c, i added some timeout control. your orginal
code will hang if client not take accept char.
two things left:
1. find port with debug device, and set it to default debug port.
Nvidia chipset has one in PCI config space. need to check other
chipset...
2. make ehci controller can work at the same time with debuge port.
