Well, I always thought that ROM-BIOS is expected to
be... well... read-only? Can you really write to your BIOS? [I know
about Flash-BIOSen, but they are certainly not writable by "normal"
write.] Plus we should overwrite it with same values...
Anyway, IMO bios should be marked as reserved (and we should not be
touching reserved pages). Can you verify that your BIOS is properly
marked reserved? [Ccing l-k, this might be interesting.]
