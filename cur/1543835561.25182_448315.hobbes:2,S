Well, ramfs has some pitfalls, which doesn't make it suitable for a 
long-lived rootfs.  OTOH, tmpfs is much more mature, while semantically the 
same.
Being semantically the same, while not exhibiting ramfs pitfalls, makes it 
suitable to be pushed into the -stable tree, IMHO.
It's your call, but this patch should have been in 2.6 since day 1.
Thanks!
