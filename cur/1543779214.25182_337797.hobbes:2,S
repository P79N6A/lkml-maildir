I'm not really sure, what you disagree about.
1 HZ is about one second, which I don't think is such a difficult concept. 
I already said wrapper functions are fine and for anything smaller than 
HZ/2 it's probably a good idea nowadays.
My main point is to keep the core functionality in jiffies and provide 
some wrapper functions. What exactly do you disagree here on?
bye, Roman
