Subject: Re: [RFC][PATCH 0/3] A Dynticks Aware Processor Idle PM Governor
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/31/435

Applied this series to acpi-test
in anticipation that Venki is about to send some incremental
patches to address the feedback on it.
thanks,
