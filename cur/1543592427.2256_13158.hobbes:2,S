Not really, our policy has been much more restrictive than the rest of the
kernel.  Look at the patches we didn't send in.

The patch is a _huge_ change to the way files are deleted and truncated, to
what happens during mount, and to the way transactions work.  It is
effectively a format extension, and must be verified against both 2.2.x
kernels and 2.4.x kernels, in both disk formats.
Before I even consider introducing a change of this size, I want to be as
sure as I can the rest of the code is stable.  It is the only way we can
debug it and stay sane.  Even after I release the code, I won't want it in
an ac series for a while.  It does much more harm than good if it somehow
ruins compatibility with an older kernel, especially in 2.4.x.  
Yes, it is a bug fix.  But, it is a very different kind of bug fix than
something that corrupts files at random, or something that doesn't get
buffers to disk at the right time.  
I won't pretend the fix isn't important, but I won't allow larger changes
to ruin the progress we've made so far.
