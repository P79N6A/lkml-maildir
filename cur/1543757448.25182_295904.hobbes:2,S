Well, I'm not sure if input layer is suitable for batteries... Modern
battery has quite a lot of parameters. It can tell you current
voltage, current capacity (either mAh or mWh), design capacity, last
capacity at full charge, current current, battery's estimate of run
time (which may be better than system's estimate), ... But some
batteries only know percentage of energy left, and some batteries only
know current voltage (you can estimate %left from that). I'm not sure
if input system can handle all that complexity...
