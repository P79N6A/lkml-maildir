You are obviously not quite familiar with industrial boxes where this is
state-of-the-art. 
My thinking is:
* CPU hotplug: should not be too hard
* RAM hotplug: has already been discussed in several threads, sure needs brain,
but must be doable.
Generally spoken every part of a computer should be thought of as a "resource"
that can be added or removed at any time during runtime. CPU or RAM is in no
way different.
