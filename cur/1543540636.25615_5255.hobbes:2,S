Seriously (or "Sealand" :)  Note that there is nothing, as far as I
can tell, that would keep us from integrating the FreeS/WAN group's
work into the standard kernel.  They still maintain their own code,
and we integrate their work.  Now, they might have difficulties with
this because of the lack of an "untainted" code base to work against.
