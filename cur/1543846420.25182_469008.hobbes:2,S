I think this is fine, but I also think it's a bit hacky.
Wouldn't it make more sense to make the whole "nofxsr" thing just clear 
the capability, ie just a diff like the appended...
Does that work for you? If so, we should _also_ make sure that "no387" 
calls this function too, so that you don't have to do _both_ no387 and 
nofxsr, which is clearly silly. Once you do no387, the kernel should do 
the nofxsr for you, methinks..
