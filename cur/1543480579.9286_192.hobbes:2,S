> I just compiled 2.2.0-pre7-ac7. Guess what. It still oopses. So once again you'll find the oops trace, and the contents of /proc/pci, /proc/scsi/scsi and /proc/scsi/aic7xxx/0. Please tell me if it is a known problem and if somebody is working on it. It's my 3rd oops report on this issue but so far nobody anwered my mails.

I updated my Adaptec-BIOS from 1.21 to 1.34.3. Nothing changed :((
