Yes, thank you.

I made some tests with iozone on 2 CPU hyperthreaded computer (= 4 CPUs,
Bull Express 5800 120 Lh), and it seems atomic_t is faster than
"percpu_counter". I'll try to make some tests on IBM x440 (8 CPUs, 16 if
hyperthreaded) with iozone and sysbench.
Moreover, I think percpu_counter uses a lot of memory...

Anyway, wa can't have a 64bit addressing space on a 32bit machine, so I
think, for the moment, it's not a problem.
