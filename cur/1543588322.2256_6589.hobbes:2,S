Francois (PCI DMA) and me (everything else).  The scyld version does not
support 2.4 kernels, so these changes were necessary.
Besides Francois changes, the biggest thing in 2.4.3 was a merge of
additional scyld.com code :)
I'm leaving on a trip so I won't be able to look at this until after
2.4.4 is released...   Maybe one of you guys is willing to play patch
circus, and go through the changes to the epic driver one by one and see
which one caused the breakage.  When I get back I'll take a look at
this.
Here's a suggestion to try: go through epic100.c and write 0x12
unconditionally to MIICfg register.  Right now it is conditional:  if
(dev->if_port...) out(0x12,ioaddr+MIICfg);
