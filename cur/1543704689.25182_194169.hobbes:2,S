Well, at least not hardware problems, I think. I don't know anything 
about messages that xmms throws, but it hangs regularly under heavy 
disk load. Usually clicking pause and play is enough to bring it back.
In case of doing anything else it hangs completely. 
I have Athlon XP 1700+, sound via via82xx, ATA-100, 
kernel 2.6.1 (with 2.6.0 was the same). 
Had no problems with 2.4, but haven't used alsa then. Maybe i'll try to
debug it a bit more if i find some time. 
chears,
