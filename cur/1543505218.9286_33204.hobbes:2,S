That piqued my curiosity.  For others curious about what I2C might be,
see
http://www-us2.semiconductors.philips.com/acrobat/applicationnotes/AN168.pdf
It appears to be a 100KHz two-wire bus for use wiring up 
microcontrollers to each other and to peripherals inside
embedded systems like televisions, etc.
As such, an I2C driver might be handy for people using
Linux on microcontrollers to control a television set
or set-top box.
