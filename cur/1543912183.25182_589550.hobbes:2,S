That's OK. So long as the patch is against a well known tree, it
is just less ambiguous even if it doesn't actually compile :)

GFP_ATOMIC will not be failing at this point (also, kswapd could
probably have reclaimed several hundred or thousand pages in 1ms,
but that's besides the point -- we do have correct buffering here).
The watermarks go roughly like this:
high -- kswapd stops reclaiming
low  -- kswapd is started by any allocation, nothing else happens
min  -- non-GFP_ATOMIC can't go below this point; enter direct reclaim
min/X-- GFP_ATOMIC allocations fail below this point
0    -- PF_MEMALLOC fails.
