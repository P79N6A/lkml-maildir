Hello all,
I'm not quite sure if this is the right newsgroup to post this in, but I
have a few comments/bug reports about the beta kernel 2.5.50.
First off, general X performance is vastly improved. However, when compiling
something (I use Gentoo), I've noticed that the system hangs a little, and
the mouse acts strangely.  It appears to register mouse clicks when I
havent clicked anything.  It especially likes to register the mouse wheel
scroll as a paste operation.  
Under the same circumstances as before, my sound (ARtS and ALSA) is jumpy.  
I didn't notice any of these problems under 2.4.19.
BTW, I compiled with gcc3.2.
Thanks,
John
