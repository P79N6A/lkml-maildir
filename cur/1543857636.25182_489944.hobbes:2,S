please at least use an owner-recursive per-CPU lock, not a naked 
preempt_disable()! The concurrency rules for data structures changed via 
preempt_disable() are quite hard to sort out after the fact. 
(preempt_disable() is too opaque, it doesnt attach data structure to 
critical section, like normal locks do.)
