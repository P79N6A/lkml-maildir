Actually, there is. mdadm reads the bitmap file, so that would be 
broken. Also, it's just useful for a user to be able to read the bitmap 
(od -x, or similar) to figure out approximately how much more he's got 
to resync to get an array in-sync. Other than reading the bitmap file, I 
don't know of any way to determine that.
