No, in this context, the variable "pin" is to select PCI INTA/B/C/D, not
a interrupt controller pin.
If SN2 is using its pre-determied interrupt configuration, then is is
probably a bug that it calls down into this code at all, since SN2 wants
this code to be a NOP, yes?

yeah, probably these IRQ patches should come through me, but haven't b/c
my patch throughput has been very low the last couple of weeks.  At
least if I ship no new patches I don't get blamed for breaking stuff;-)

Yes, there are lots of places where IRQ0 is an error condition.  I
expect that this was lazyness based on the fact that the timer code is
hard-wired to use IRQ0, so it is always taken on IA32.  My suggestion
to un-hard-wire the timer code was not greeted with enthusiasm, so this
is how things sit.
But IRQ0 should not be a problem on the ES7000, as there is an override
to supply IRQ0 from pin 0:20.  pin 0:0, on the other hand is a PCI
interrupt on the ES7000, completely valid to be assigned from the _PRT
and to be assigned by the es7000-specific code to any arbitrary IRQ#.
I'm not sure exactly that the patch above was trying to fix.  Looks like
it is time to examine the latest ew7000 changes in detail.  But I think
the patch has pointed out that this routine really should be returning 0
for success and non zero for failure; and returning dev->irq was
probably a latent bug all along.
