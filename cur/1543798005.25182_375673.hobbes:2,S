parisc probably does compile in mainline these days.  It's certainly
much closer than it ever was before.  The 64-bit code doesn't compile
because Andi keeps blocking the is_compat_task() stuff.  Why not do the
netdevice compat_ioctl patch before killing this?  I'd hate to have to
back out this patch in the PA tree.
