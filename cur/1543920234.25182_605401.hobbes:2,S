Yes, completely agree! I think Arjans patch makes a heap of sense, but
some numbers would be great to see.

It should not be merged as-is, instead I'll provide a function to do
this. It should also set current->io_context->ioprio_changed. Since no
IO has been done yet at this point it doesn't matter. But we should cut
a piece of set_task_ioprio() out and provide that as a kernel helper for
this sort of thing.
Even just writing it as:
current->ioprio =  (IOPRIO_CLASS_RT << IOPRIO_CLASS_SHIFT) | IOPRIO_NORM;
would be more readable. Or perhaps this would suffice, given the above
restriction that IO hasn't been done yet:
current->ioprio = IOPRIO_PRIO_VALUE(IOPRIO_CLASS_RT, IOPRIO_NORM);
