With just reads you had stability on the record level at least.
Concurrent reads/seeks on a file made it obvious where things weren't
thread safe.
Obviously userspace doing stupid things isn't a kernel problem but it
could become one in the future if a previously safe concurrent pread
interface is migrated to use seqfile.

I'm only referring to unstable records since every time we seek we
trash the cache.
