No need for a new API.  We have drivers/pci/quirk.c where we add PCI
devices with known bugs.  If there is commonality of the bugs across
hardware, we can easily add a common "quirk" which fixes the situation.
Individual drivers shouldn't need to bother with this, really.
As an aside, if you need to blacklist certain _systems_ rather than
certain PCI devices, you should either modify drivers/pci/quirks.c or
arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c.
