I meant whether "immediately" mean in reference to socket
state or includes auxiliary things like route lookups.
When you do a non-blocking write on a socket, things like
memory allocations can block, potentially for a long time.
It is an example where there are definite boundaries to where
the non-blocking'ness applies.
And therefore it is not so cut and dry and you present this
issue.

And that connect() call can hang for a long time due to any memory
allocation done in the connect() path.
You are not avoiding blocking by setting O_NONBLOCK on the socket, it
is quite foolhardy to think that it does so unilaterally.
And that's why this is a grey area.  Why is waiting for memory
allocation on a O_NONBLOCK socket OK but waiting for IPSEC route
resolution is not?
