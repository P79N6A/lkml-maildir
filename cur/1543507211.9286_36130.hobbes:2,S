Hi !
I explained the problem once before, but I got no answer, maybe I
haven't described it good enough: 
running kernel 2.3.1[45], after 1-2 hours I get always the same
error when checking the filesystem (e2fsck -f -p):
 /dev/hda6: Inode 208983, i_size is 387916 should be 389120	FIXED
The Inode which has the wrong size is different, but the i_size is 
always 387916 and should always be 389120.
This occurs NOT when using kernel 2.2.xx, the problem is related only
to the 2.3.1[45] kernels, I have tested it for a few days on two
different machines. There are no lock-ups and no died tasks/processes
or something else, the machine seems to run without any problems further.
/var/log/[warn|messages] don't say anything, and the 2.3.xx kernels
work just fine (except this inode-problem).
Does anybody know what's the cause of this problem and why the i_size
gets always corrupted after few hours of running ??
I'm pretty shure that it is not a hardware problem and that my 
harddisks are working well and are not defective.
What can I do to find out which process does this inode corruptions ?
Any hints ??
So, back to 2.2.xx for this time .... :\
