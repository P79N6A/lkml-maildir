Subject: Solution to some UDMA IDE drives failing?

This is a solution (for me) rather than a problem!
Gigabyte GA-586TX4 motherboard, P233 (not overclocked) Fujitsu
MPD3108AT drive;
kernel 2.2.13pre11 with the extra IDE patches still failed to
recognise the drive as being UDMA capable (failed with BadCRC and
lots of other things if DMA enabled using hdparm)....
but turning off UDMA support in the BIOS brought it back to life,
and we now get 8MB/sec as opposed to 4.6MB/sec in PIO mode 4. Happy
again, but I don't understand it.
yours,
John Hayward-Warburton
