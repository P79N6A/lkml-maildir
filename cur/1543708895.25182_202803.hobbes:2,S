More to the point, why didn't you just install a 2.4.18 kernel
and use the Adaptec-supplied driver and the RAID-1 capabilities
built into the card's firmware?  (Note, I'm not trying to disparage
Jeff's work on libata here.)
I have this setup and it works flawlessly with a pair of 160GB
SATA drives.
