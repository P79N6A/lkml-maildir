Those tools report different things because they are measuring different
aspects of the performance.  For many system configurations, the fact that 'dd'
is writing on a buffer rather than a drive is actually a *feature*, as you
might care about just how much of a boost the cache is giving you - I don't
care how fast my compile writes to disk, I care how fast the cache and page
subsystems actually present the data to userspace...
"better results" depends on the question - otherwise "42" is as good an answer as
any, for exactly the reasons that Deep Thought gave.... ;)
