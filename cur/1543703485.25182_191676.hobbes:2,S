Wouldn't that depend on the overcommit options?
With permitted overcommit -
	compile/link ok
	launch - segfault/-ENOMEM if heap/stack + static data UPDATES exceed
		 system capacity
Without overcommit:
	-ENOMEM if the heap/stack can't be initialized; as in even the
		first page of the heap/stack fails - and before actual
		launch completes, as the situation you describe.
If static data is just referenced, it should page in, and get dropped.
