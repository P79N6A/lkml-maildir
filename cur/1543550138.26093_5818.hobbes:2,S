Not sure what you mean with out-smart.
My only point is that the OS actually can only swapout such shm. If that
SHM is not supposed to be swapped out and if the OS I/O cache have more aging
then the shm cache, then the OS should tell the DBMS that it's time to shrink
some shm page by freeing it.

For the mapped pages we never make presumptions. We always check the accessed
bit and that's the most reliable info to know if the page is been accessed
recently (set from the cpu accesse through the pte not only during page faults
or cache hits).  With the current design pages mapped multiple times will be
overaged a bit but this can't be fixed until we make a page->pte reverse
lookup...
