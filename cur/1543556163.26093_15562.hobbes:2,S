No slaves on mine.
> What brand is your motherboard?
Intel Morrison64 (not Morrison32!) aka Advanced/MN (in some sources Advanced/AL). BIOS AMI 1.00.03.CA0 (upgraded to 1.00.04.CA0).
What version of hdparm are you using? By the output it looks like 3.9, patched? Did DMA work from the very beginning? Can you send me a copy of your .config file?
Regards
Guennadi
