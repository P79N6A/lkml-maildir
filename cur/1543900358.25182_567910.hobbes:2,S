That's correct.  (Though it's the client that's doing the comparison,
actually--the server is just reporting the value.)

The choice of upper word in your example is arbitrary, but other than
that I believe your example is essentially the only one.  So this would
only happen when *both*
	- the read of the new value of the low word happens precisely
	  2^32 i_version updates after the word was read on the client's
	  previous cache revalidation, and
	- the value of i_version itself is close enough to a 32-bit
	  boundary that wraparound can happen between the reads of the
	  high and low words.

A 32-bit i_version could in theory wrap pretty quickly, couldn't it?
That's not a problem in itself--the problem would only arise if two
subsequent client queries of the change attribute happened a multiple of
2^32 i_version increments apart.
This is more likely than the previous scenario, but still very unlikely.
I would have guessed that even in situations with a very high rate of
updates and a low rate of client revalidations, the chance of two
revalidations happening exactly 2^32 updates apart would still be no
more than 1 in 2^32.  (Could odd characteristics of the workloads (like
updates that tend to happen in power-of-2 groups?) make it any more
likely?)
I'd be happier if ext4 at least allowed the possibility of 64 bits in
the future.  And there's always the chance someone would find a use for
an i_version that was nondecreasing, even if nfs didn't care.

If the client always requests the change attribute before reading, and
the i_version is always updated after data is modified, I think we're
OK.  Admittedly this is a little subtle.
