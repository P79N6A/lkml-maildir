That's an accident: PG_lazyfree got added but the out-of-tree ext4 patches
didn't get updated.
otoh, the intersection between pages which are PageBooked() and pages which
are PageLazyFree() should be zreo, so it'd be good to actually formalise
this reuse within the ext4 patches.
otoh2, PageLazyFree() could have reused PG_owner_priv_1.
Rik, Ted: any thoughts?  We do need to scrimp on page flags: when we
finally run out, we're screwed.
