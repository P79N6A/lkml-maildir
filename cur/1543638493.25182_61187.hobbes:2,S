Please fix that before you give your presentation.
Sparse files won't save you from the triple-indirection limit.
This has me suspicious of the other numbers as well.
Ext2 gives you 0xc blocks addressed right off the inode.
Then with one 4 kB block of block pointers, you can get
to another 0x400 (1024) blocks. With a block of pointers to
blocks of pointers, you may address another 0x100000 blocks.
Finally, triple indirection gives you a block of pointers
to blocks of pointers to blocks of pointers, for another
0x40000000 data blocks. That's a total of:
0x4010040c blocks
0x4010040c000 bytes
4.4e12 bytes and change
4402 GB (decimal gigabytes)
4.4 TB (decimal terabytes)
Of course you can't really use 4.4 TB on 32-bit Linux,
so there is a sort of dishonesty in making this claim.
I can get to 2.2 TB, which disturbingly would wrap any
code using signed 32-bit math on units of 512 bytes.
The exact limits are:
0x000001ffffffefff max offset
0x000001fffffff000 max size
