It's in mod_devicetable.h: see comment at top of that file.  These
structures serve dual purpose: to describe the capabilities of the
driver to the kernel probing functions, *and* to export them to
userspace tables.  The former purpose is why there's a data pointer in
there.
scripts/mod/file2alias is the program that reads this: although it can
be altered to parse 32-vs-64, Adrian's fix is the simplest.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
