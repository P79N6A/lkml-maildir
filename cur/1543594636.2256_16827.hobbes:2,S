My post you replied to yesterday, subject "Re: getrusage vs /proc/pid/stat",
contains code that does what you want (it's also at 
http://www.kegel.com/lt.tar.gz
).  
To use it, declare a variable
  LinuxTimes lt;
have each thread call lt.addSelf() once; then to measure the total CPU time
used by all those threads as a group, call lt.times() instead of times().
(On Solaris, you can continue to just call times(), you don't need lt at all.)
lt.times() is a simulation of the classical times() system call for LinuxThreads.
Let me know if this helps.  And anyone else, let me know if there's a simpler
way to do this.  Should LinuxThreads be doing this under the hood, so it can
be a little closer to posix threads compliance?
