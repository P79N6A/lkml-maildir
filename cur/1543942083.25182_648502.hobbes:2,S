The original OpenCores keyboard controller is a 6 rows x 12 cols 
keyboard controller that can be customized for other row/col sizes 
modifiying Constants.vhd VHDL file, in which also the translation table 
is defined, and for different key disposition schemes both the number of 
rows and cols can be changed. We are currently using this controller 
with a 4x4 key matrix, and with a different key mapping values, so I 
thought that it would be preferable to have the driver mapping fixed to 
1:1 and do the mapping in the VHDL, since in most cases the keyboard 
using this controller would be different to the default keyboard defined 
in the original Contants.vhd VHDL file.
