There should be a register/unregister interface that uses RCU.  That
makes sense.  This assumes that this is an uncommon thing that happens
at init/load and unload. The notifier callback's better not change
themselves! Especially, since they get called when the system may be in
a unstable state like in a panic or other error handling.
