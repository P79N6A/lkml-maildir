That points away from the TSC actually. select and alarm use the jiffies
clock, which is managed by the PIT timer in the southbridge. AFAIK
they never rely on the TSC.

Assuming it is the TSC: 
You could write a multithreaded program that polls the TSCs
on your both CPU for a long time and check out the drift rate. 
The kernel will try to fix it at boot time, but it cannot do that when the TSCs
are drifting later.
One way to work around it would be to boot with "notsc". This will
make your gettimeofday() slower and more inaccurate though.
In theory you could resync the TSC in a regularly running timer,
but this would probably be quite some overhead.
Assuming it is not: 
Something is wrong with your PIT timer in the southbridge. Maybe
just run ntpd ?
I know that later AMD chipsets - in particular the 8111 - are somewhat
bad time keepers, which makes it a good idea to run NTP always.
