   Btw, both the Sparc64 and the PPC code still call "lock_kernel()"
   before calling the ipc functions. The new ipc functions are thread
   safe, someone could remove these calls.
sparc64 still does not build/work on sparc64, let me take care
of that first ok (I'm currently at 2.3.27 and constantly trying
to catch up one patch set at a time)? :-)
