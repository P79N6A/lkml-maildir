The queue depth being set, is the highest queueing depth that the scsi
mid layer will throw at you. The actual TCQ depth may be lower, depends
on the hardware. aacraid, iirc, has a pretty big depth so I woudldn't be
surprised if it could use all of those 128 tags.
It would be interesting to see a forced depth of 2 with AS against the
stock case of 128 (and deadline).
