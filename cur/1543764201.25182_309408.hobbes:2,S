Subject: bdflush/rpciod high CPU utilization, profile does not make sense

Hello list,
Setup; 
 NFS server (dual opteron, HW RAID, SCA disk enclosure) on 2.6.11.6
 NFS client (dual PIII) on 2.6.11.6
Both on switched gigabit ethernet - I use NFSv3 over UDP (tried TCP but
this makes no difference).
Problem; during simple tests such as a 'cp largefile0 largefile1' on the
client (under the mountpoint from the NFS server), the client becomes
extremely laggy, NFS writes are slow, and I see very high CPU
utilization by bdflush and rpciod.
For example, writing a single 8G file with dd will give me about
20MB/sec (I get 60+ MB/sec locally on the server), and the client rarely
drops below 40% system CPU utilization.
I tried profiling the client (booting with profile=2), but the profile
traces do not make sense; a profile from a single write test where the
client did not at any time drop below 30% system time (and frequently
were at 40-50%) gives me something like:
raven:~# less profile3 | sort -nr | head
257922 total                                      2.6394
254739 default_idle                             5789.5227
   960 smp_call_function                          4.0000
   888 __might_sleep                              5.6923
   569 finish_task_switch                         4.7417
   176 kmap_atomic                                1.7600
   113 __wake_up                                  1.8833
    74 kmap                                       1.5417
    64 kunmap_atomic                              5.3333
The difference between default_idle and total is 1.2% - but I never saw
system CPU utilization under 30%...
Besides, there's basically nothing in the profile that rhymes with
rpciod or bdflush (the two high-hitters on top during the test).
What do I do?
Performance sucks and the profiles do not make sense...
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated,
Thank you!
