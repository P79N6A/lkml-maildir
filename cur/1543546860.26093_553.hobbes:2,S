Things like process_timeout() knows the task is sleeping thus it would be
a double waste of CPU time for them to check if the waitqueue is empty and
then also to grab the waitqueue spinlocks to do the wakeup browsing the
list with only 1 task in it. I don't think we should force the whole
kernel not to use wake_up_process, I think there are cases where using
wake_up_process carefully is better and it doesn't seems to be an abuse of
the scheduler internals to me. Furthmore the same optimization you did at
the waitqueue layer can be done also at the wake_up_process layer (not try
to wakeup a task that is just running). But that would be still a waste
for a things like process_timeout() and it should be checked carefully
w.r.t. SMP races since it wouldn't anymore put a barrier between the
checking of the state and the previous instructions (so it should probably
called with another name).
Returning to your patch you're introducing an SMP race in the wait event
interface. We enforced that wake_up had to provide an implicit memory
barrier to avoid adding an explicit memory barrier in the middle of things
like UnlockPage. On IA32 at least UnlockPage can't trigger the race
because there's the lock on the bus to do the clear_bit, but for example
on the alpha we do the clear bit with the load locked store conditional
operations (same thing on sparc64), thus we don't put any memory barrier
anymore between clearing the bit and reading the waitqueue. Thus I think
we could read the waitqueue before the effect of the clear_bit become
visible to the other CPUs, and that will have the effect of reversing the
order of execution between wake_up and clear_bit.
	CPU0				CPU1
					wake_up() -> got reordered before clear_bit
	add_to_wait_queue() /* too late */
	do {
		sync_page()
		set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)
		if (!PageLocked())
			schedule()
					clear_bit(PG_locked)
	*deadlock*
With the implicit spin_lock() at the preamble of wake_up the above can
never happen.
Something like the above can trigger also in IA32 due the write buffer (if
the event setting isn't done with atomic operations of course :), btw, the
only reason we have the atomic operation while clearing the page->flags is
because of things like shrink_mmap that play with the referenced bit even
while the page may be locked).
I see there are things like UnlockPage() that doesn't have any waiter most
of time while doing normal reads and writes and we can safely optimize
some suprious spin_lock/_unlock away this way:
