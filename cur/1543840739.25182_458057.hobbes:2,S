We need to hold workqueue_mutex to protect the per-cpu workqueue resources
while cpu_online_map is changing and while per-cpu memory is being
allocated or freed.
Look at cpu_down() and mentally replace the
blocking_notifier_call_chain(CPU_DOWN_PREPARE) with
mutex_lock(workqueue_mutex), etc.  The __stop_machine_run() in there
modifies the (ie: potentially frees) the workqueue code's per-cpu memory. 
So we take that resource's lock while doing so.
