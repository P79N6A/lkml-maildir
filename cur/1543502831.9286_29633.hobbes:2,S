depends on the definition of nicer, clone is less complicated to implement
except when you start dealing with signaling threads and implementing a
M to N mapping thread library.

well, context switches are painful as is any kernel crossing in high
performance computing. imagine user level networking on high speed
connections that can have round trip times in the ~50us range (this is
a software implementation in our lab, SGI's GSN is committed to round
trip times of around 7us roundtrip hardware latency), if you
have several outstanding connections and your kernel switch between
a thread per connection is around 20us then it sux to be you. of course
you could say that going to an event loop programming model would be
much more appropriate for this system, but if you can get a thread
model to handle it this type of load, then do it.

so, i am really confused by this with the sample program attached below
and run against the MIT pthreads user level package and the glibc
linuxthreads implementation shows a bit of a bigger difference than you
suggest over a 2.2.9 kernel.
the cache miss domination argument doesn't seem to make alot of sense
unless you want to believe you are flushing the whole cache which you
aren't because you are sharing the VM space between the threads.
