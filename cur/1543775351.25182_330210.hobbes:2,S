Agreed!  For someone working on making PREEMPT_RT better, comparing to
SMP code running on a UP kernel is extremely useful, since it gives an
idea on where to focus.  But someone who was wanting to build a realtime
application might not care so much.
Me, I would like to see an SMP-kernel comparison on a 2-CPU or 4-CPU
system, though probably not too many applications want SMP realtime
quite yet.  My guess is that SMP realtime will be increasingly
important, though.

Agreed, a PREEMPT_RT-to-IPIPE comparison will never be an apples-to-apples
comparison.  Raw data will never be a substitute for careful thought,
right?  ;-)

Me too!  ;-)  For me, the real surprise was that I-PIPE's and PREEMPT_RT's
worst-case irq latencies were roughly comparable.  I would have guessed
that I-PIPE would have been 2x-3x better than PREEMPT_RT.
And I expect that there are a number of applications where it is worth
paying the extra system-call cost in order to gain the better latencies,
particularly those that spend most of their time executing in user mode.
As you continue your work reducing the costs, more and more applications
would see the benefit.
Other applications might need the low-cost system calls badly enough
that they want to deal with the greater complexity of the non-unified
I-PIPE programming model.
Still others might be satisfied with the less-good realtime latency of
a straight CONFIG_PREEMPT kernel.  Or even of a non-CONFIG_PREEMPT
kernel.

Agreed, this experiment would not be useful to an user -- after all,
if the user has a single-threaded application, they should just buy
a UP box, run a UP kernel on it, and not bother with the experiment.
This experiment -might- be useful to a developer who is working on
either the SMP kernel or on the hardware, and who wants to measure the
overhead of SMP -- in fact, I did this sort of experiment (among others,
of course!) in my RCU dissertation.
I also agree that Kristian's and Karim's benchmark does not show the
full picture.  No set of benchmark data, no matter how carefully designed
and collected, will ever be a substitute for careful consideration of
all aspects of the problem.  The realtime latency and the added overhead
are important, but they are not the only important things.
But, for the moment, I need to get back to an RCU implementation that
I owe you.  It is at least limping, which is better than I would have
expect, but needs quite a bit more work.  ;-)
						Thanx, Paul
