One allocator is all I need; it would just be grand if all could be
supported.
So what you suggest is not placing the 'emergency' slab into the regular
place so that normal allocations will not be able to find it. Then if an
emergency allocation cannot be satified by the regular path, we fall
back to the slow path and find the emergency slab.

I could hack in a similar reserve slab; by catching the failure of the
regular allocation path. It'd not make it prettier though.
The thing is; I'm not needing any speed, as long as the machine stay
alive I'm good. However others are planing to build a full reserve based
allocator to properly fix the places that now use __GFP_NOFAIL and
situation such as in add_to_swap().
A well, one thing at a time. I'll hack this up.
