Hello!
Since radeonfb driver was moved from -ac to official packages -
I've done diffs of radeonfb driver for Linus distribution.
What is noticeable:
- merge with Ani Joshi radeonfb-0.1.0 (fixed console switches, blanking fixes)
- ENABLE CRT PORT ON RADEON VE!!!
- Radeon M6, M7 support (EXPERIMENTAL!!!)
- fixed bug of rom bios detection on Radeon VE
- MTRR support
Best regards! Nick
