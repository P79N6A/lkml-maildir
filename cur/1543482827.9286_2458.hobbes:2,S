How serious is _serious_?

Sounds reasonable.

Sounds like a fully ok solution.
The main issue is, however: when will v2.3.x be opened up? Maybe we should
have some kind of wild wish-list/death-list brainstorm here before v2.3.x
opens up?
I'd really like to know what you believe to be the main-issues that we
need to deal with in v2.3, and what the schedule should be for it.
Personally, I think that the development time for v2.3 must be
significantly shorter than the one for v2.1, and more focused on a narrow
set of important improvements, apart from obvious bugfixes and new
drivers.
