Well, before the TSO changes, if TSO was enabled then TCP would not obey slow
start or do congestion control properly.  Did you increase the TCP send/receive
buffers (sysctl's net.ipv4.tcp_rmem and net.ipv4.tcp_wmem)? You may just
be window limited.  Also, 2.6.9 has TCP bugs with TSO that can cause panic's.
These have been fixed in 2.6.10-rc2.
