 From ISO/IEC 9899:TC2, both of these specifically mention volatile:
7.13.2.1 The longjmp function
3 All accessible objects have values, and all other components of the 
abstract machine212) have state, as of the time the longjmp function was 
called, except that the values of objects of automatic storage duration 
that are local to the function containing the invocation of the 
corresponding setjmp macro that do not have volatile-qualified type and 
have been changed between the setjmp invocation and longjmp call are 
indeterminate.
7.14.1.1 The signal function
5 If the signal occurs other than as the result of calling the abort or 
raise function, the behavior is undefined if the signal handler refers 
to any object with static storage duration other than by assigning a 
value to an object declared as volatile sig_atomic_t, ...

Sure, so the implementation of the locking primitives requires 
hardware-specific knowledge.
But for someone coding to POSIX, is there any reason why they would use 
barriers?  If so, what API would they use?
