I wasn't clear enough.  I meant that the change did not fix the 
seemlingly-m15w problems on 3114.

I took out ATA_FLAG_NOINTR test from sata_sil in the latest ALL branch 
and tested it.  It fails to read IDENTIFY data.  Actually, there is no 
code to read PIO data.  It should be done in the interrupt handler but 
sil_port_irq doesn't do it.

Ah... I see.  Section 7.4 of sii3112 manual says that
Wait until an IDE channel interrupt (bit 11 in the IDEx Task File Timing 
+ Configuration + Status register is set).
Where the register is at BAR5 + 0xA0 and bit 11 is
• Bit [11]: Interrupt Status (R) – IDE0 Interrupt Status. This bit set 
indicates that an interrupt is pending on IDE0. This bit provides 
real-time status of the IDE0 interrupt pin.
And, section 6.7.1 (PCI bus master - IDE0 register) says
• Bit [18]: IDE0 DMA Comp (R/W1C) – IDE0 DMA Completion Interrupt. 
During write DMA operation, This bit set indicates that the IDE0 
interrupt has been asserted and all data has been written to system 
memory. During Read DMA, This bit set indicates that the IDE0 interrupt 
has been asserted. This bit must be W1C by software when set during DMA 
operation (bit 0 is set). During normal operation, this bit reflects 
IDE0 interrupt line.
So, the last sentence means that while on DMA command is in progress, 
bit 18 of the PCI bus master is identical to bit 11 of the conf/status 
register.  Right?
Yeap, I agree that this is a good change although it hurts a little bit 
that it causes a few extra PCI transactions.
Also, it seems a little bit weird that the code enters interrupt 
handling even for ports which don't have ATA_DMA_INTR set, although I 
don't think the current code would bogusly finish commands due to the 
ATA_BUSY check.  Is this intentional?

That sounds cool.
