Subject: [PATCH] fix vsyscall page core dump segment size
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/5/16/32

My change to core dumps that was included with the vsyscall DSO
implementation had a bug (braino on my part).  Core dumps don't include the
full page of the vsyscall DSO, and so don't accurately represent the whole
memory image of the process.  This patch fixes it.
arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32_binfmt.c's copy of this code needs the corresponding
update as well.  I don't include a patch since that code is not in the main
tree.
Thanks,
Roland
