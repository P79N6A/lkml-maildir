I think Bill is referring to the "resume" interface i.e an
unset_all_cpus_idle() interface, which is missing (set/unset
probably are not good prefixes maybe?). I feel we can
add one.

Should be from the place where the last cpu is set in the bitmap
and bitmap is found equal to cpu_online_map.

So are you saying that setting of the CPU in the bitmap will be done
inside reprogram_timer routine? If we consider that reprogram_timer can 
directly point to a routine in a interrupt source file (like apic.c/timer_pit.c)
I dont think that it is the right place to set bits in the nohz_cpu_mask.
It can be done by the callee of reprogram_timer itself.
