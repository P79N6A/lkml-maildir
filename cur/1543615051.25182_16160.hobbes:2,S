You don't.
There is no fixed method, though the following may help:
1. eth0 is assigned to the first device identified. This works if you have
   multiple interfaces (using different drivers), then the order the drivers
   are loaded will define which is eth0 - I do this for a system with
   mixed 3c509 (ISA), and 3c905 (PCI) interfaces.
2. In a muli-interface environment with (say) two 3c509 - the order happens
   to be in bus order. This has implied that the slot number it is plugged
   in determines which is eth0. In my case a system has two PCI 3c905C
   interfaces, the first at 00:0e.0, and the second at 00:0f.0. The 0e.0
   interface appears as eth0.
Note: if one of the interfaces is unplugged/fails dramatically , the bus scan
will assign the FIRST interface located as eth0. The only way to determine
the ACTUAL eth0 is via mac number and trial and error.
I configure ONE interface (all others are down), then plug in to a working
network.
If I can ping the other machine then I know which network a given
interface is on - label it.
Now down that interface, and initialize another one. Repeat until all
interfaces are identified.
