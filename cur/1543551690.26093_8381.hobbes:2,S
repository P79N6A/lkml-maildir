Hi,
I hope IF C++ kernel modules written I could find the same module written in
C too, because I would refuse using C++ in kernel for various reasons.
I'm Hungarian guy and I can speak English (yeah, only a bit ;-).
Note that I can't make Hungarian the default language for a software
made for non Hungarians. So I think it's not good to try to write C++
in a system written in C. Or convert the whole kernel into C++, but please
do not mix several languages together ... I think it's a bad idea.
Comments ?
