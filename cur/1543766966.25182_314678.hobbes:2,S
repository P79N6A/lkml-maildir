It's not just pleasentness.  You should be _very_ careful with any
changes you make to this kind of code, and have a very clear
explanation why the change is needed, and why it won't do any trouble.
I didn't actually think about the sb_list stuff, but my feeling is you
should not move it unless there's a very clear reason to do so.
