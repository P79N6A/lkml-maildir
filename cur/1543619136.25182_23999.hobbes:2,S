Linus,
That's fine, but there's a major problem with your scheme.  What happens
with all the stuff for which no one is listed in MAINTAINERS?  For example,
no one owns linux/Documentation.  As the person nominally in charge of
linux/Documentation/Changes, there's no one between me and you, period, let
alone anyone between me and you that you trust....  And I realize that you
don't consider documentation very important, but there are other segments of
the Linux source tree for which this breakdown in hierarchy is also true....
later,
chris
