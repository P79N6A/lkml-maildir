I don't know.
Taking read_lock(&tasklist_lock) for send_specific_sig_info might hurt 
scalability. Ingo?
If we do not want a global lock, then we have two options:
- make task_lock an interrupt spinlock.
- add a second spinlock to the task structure, for the signal stuff.
Design question - what's worse? Memory bloat or a few additional 
local_irq_{en,dis}able().
I don't care - no performance critical codepaths.
Additionally many task_lock()/task_unlock users could be replaced with 
spin_unlock_wait(&task->alloc_lock), which would not need the 
local_irq_disable().
