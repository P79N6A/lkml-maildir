G'day all,
First off I will explain what I was doing that caused the problem.
I was copying a whole CD to the hard-drive. They are both scsi AIC7xxx.
While I was copying I noticed Xosview not looking too healthy so I ran top
and noticed that the amount of buffer memory was obviously wrong.
here is the vmstat output :
:vmstat
   procs                      memory    swap          io     system cpu
 r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    cs  us sy id
 1  0  0    744   2908 4193304 205452   0   0     2     4   52    14  47 0 53
                       ^^^^^^^
Notice the 4.1 GIG of buffer memory.
Also half way through the copy klogd started using up all the CPU time on
one of the processors.
Even after the copy had finished klogd was still using up large amounts of
CPU (100%).
The machine is Dual PIII 450 compiled as SMP with AIC 7xxx SCSI driver.
With 256 meg ram.
Cheers Mof.
