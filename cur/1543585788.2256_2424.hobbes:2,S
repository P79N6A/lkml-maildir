U can set cb to zero, but u also plan to use cb for storing ur data. If
that happens then u need to modify the way the macro IPCB
(probably in net/ip.h) is defined. Also make sure to increase the size 
of cb to accomodate ur data. This will solve ur problem but making this
general (part of the standard kernel code) needs a lot of work in the ip
layer. The cb is also used by TCP. The same needs to be done in IP layer
but this will again largly depend on the layers below and hence the
complexity.
The alternative to this is that u can add another buffer like cb in
sk_buff.
