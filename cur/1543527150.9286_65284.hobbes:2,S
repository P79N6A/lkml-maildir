I think the PII can match both of those correctly.

A really good optimiser might expand the control flow graph to
accomodate poor branch prediction.... but not in this example.

Actually bit-ors were faster for some simpler operations on old
processors too.
Consider:
   mov var1,%reg
   or  var2,%reg
   jne label
vs.
   mov var1,%reg
   jne label
   mov var2,%reg
   jne label
 or even
   mov var1,%reg
   or  %reg,%reg
   jne label 
   mov var2,%reg
   or  %reg,%reg
   jne label 
enjoy,
