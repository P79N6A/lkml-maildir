Ok.

There are lots of ways to go with this, and I'd like to get an
idea of what you think makes most sense before going off and
spending tons of time here.
I see possible choices as:
  1) create something like:
	/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/topology/socket_id
     And leave it up to the arch to figure if/how they want to
     implement it. On ia64 systems, we can get this information
     from the _SUN method.
  2) create something like:
  	/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/acpi/
     And port over the stuff from /proc/acpi, adding in a new
     field for _SUN.
Thoughts?
Thanks.
