is this a boot-time-only problem? In recent updates to the softlockup 
code in -mm:
 timer-irq-driven-soft-watchdog-cleanups.patch
 timer-irq-driven-soft-watchdog-percpu-race-fix.patch
 timer-irq-driven-soft-watchdog-percpu-fix.patch
 timer-irq-driven-soft-watchdog-boot-fix.patch
i changed soft lockup detection to be turned off during bootup. That
should work around any boot-time warnings.
(if this can happen on a booted up system then the real fix would indeed
be to split up register_console()'s workload - that would also make it
more preemption-friendly. But at first sight it looks quite complex to
do.)
