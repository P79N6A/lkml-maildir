Indeed.

Hmm, interesting. A password per resize is not terribly onerous though.

There's been some talk about such infrastructure already. I believe
some pieces of it may already be in place.

While possibly suboptimal, this won't surprise anyone. But dmsetup has
no mention of security in its manpage and doesn't show keys in typical
LVM usage. So people might reasonably assume that data from dmsetup
tables is not secret.
