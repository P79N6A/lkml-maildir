/me scratches head
We know, that
- disabling local apic timers work
- local apic timers (which turn off PIT) work. when noacpiFSCKEDPARSING
is given on the kernel command line.
I have no clue, what might be the difference of noacpiFSCKEDPARSING. The
boot log is not giving any hint at all.
acpi_disable_pci() sets acpi_pci_disabled and acpi_noirq to 1.
What happens, if you set "acpi=noirq" instead ?
