Hi, some of the APIs of Linux do get tested with full traceability. For 
instance, there is the Open Posix Test Suite. It tests the combination of Linux 
and libraries to check that they conform to Posix specifications.
This seems to be sponsored by Intel as far as I remember.
The OSDL also is writing specifications for Linux (e.g. Carrier Grade Linux) or 
ways to integrate components from the Linux world (e.g. kernel.org sources + 
high res timers from Montavista) to achieve some kind of performance.
I would therefore say that there are in fact roadmaps and specifications for 
Linux (note that this is my opinion as a user). And more seem to be emerging 
even though most of the development is probably driven by the process that Kyle 
just described.
	these were my 2 cents as a user,
