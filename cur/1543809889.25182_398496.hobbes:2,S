Sounds good.

Always good. I just didn't want to be the one :)

Gah! I missed those APIs. Makes perfect sense.

Slight optimization -
	if (get_nr_files() >= files_stat.max_files) {
		if (capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)) {
		/*
		 * percpu_counters are inaccurate.  Do an expensive check before
		 * we go and fail.
		 */
			if (percpu_counter_sum(&nr_files) >= 
						files_stat.max_files)
				goto over;
		} else 
			goto over;
	}

Well, as of now there is none (xfs use was removed a few months ago).
So, I removed the EXPORT_SYMBOL for get_nr_files() and forgot to
make it static. Your patch does the right thing.
Thanks
