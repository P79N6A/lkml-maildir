I have finally gotten around to getting 2.6.x libata development moved 
over from BitKeeper to git.
The "for Linus/Andrew" repository is libata-2.6.git, available at
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/libata-2.6.git/
The new libata-dev repository is libata-dev.git, available at
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/libata-dev.git/
A word about these repositories.  I don't use any SCM besides git 
itself.  libata-2.6.git appears as you would expect:  .git/HEAD points 
to refs/heads/master, which is the top-of-tree, and contains patches 
destined for upstream ASAP.
libata-dev.git is a bit different, as it contains multiple branches:
> [jgarzik@pretzel libata-dev]$ ls .git/refs/heads/
> adma        atapi-enable        iomap        pdc2027x
> adma-mwi    bridge-detect       iomap-step1  pdc20619
> ahci-atapi  chs-support         master       promise-sata-pata
> ahci-msi    ioctl-get-identity  passthru     sil24
I use the attached 'git-switch-tree' script to update the working 
directory to reflect the desired branch.
As soon as I am comfortable with git merging, I will create an 'ALL' 
branch, which contains all of these trees, merged together properly.
