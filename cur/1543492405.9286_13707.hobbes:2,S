Problem description:
	Since several weeks we realized that some days, the system clock 
	of a dual pentium system goes back by 10/15 minutes some days,
	meanwhile other days the clock was correct.
	The same problem was discovered on a second dual Pentium system
	and reported to this forum.
Solution:
	According with  Clayton Weaver (cgweav@eskimo.com) we had two solutions
	to turn around this problem:
	1) assuming the hardware clock was uncorrected, use nist package
	2) assuming the hardware clock was correct, use hwclock
	The hardware clock is stable, this means in 10 days it didn't went back
	on both systems.
	We have introduced by cron on each hour the command
		hwclock --hctosys
	and both system clocks are now fine.
Feeling:
	The fact the system clock was degrading some days and not other days
	is probably due by the fact the days the system clock was corrupted
	the system executed heavy disk I/O night background tasks.
	Both systems have an internal adaptec scsi controller addressing
	4 9GB scsi disks. Then one system is using DPT controller meanwhile
	the second is using Mylex eXtremeRAID 1100 for RAID5 storage.
	Both systems are using the same network controller (3Com 3C905)
	My feeling is that the timer interrupts are delayed by some scsi driver
	interrupt handler.
	This is a copy of current /proc/interrupts:
	 0:   16382786   timer
 	 1:       1643   keyboard
 	 2:          0   cascade
 	 8:          3 + rtc
	11:   10953720   eth0
	12:    1293394   aic7xxx
	13:    8687408 + IPI
Hope this will help
