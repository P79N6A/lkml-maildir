I've seen that fix in the latest -mm
patch released shortly after I wrote
the original message, but I can't help
feeling that the other serial drivers
have the same bug. I can see the very
same code in the au1x00_uart.c and other
files too, and it doesn't look like the
fix affected those.
I wasn't dare to ask, but now since also
Alan is bothered - can you please confirm
the other drivers are safe?
