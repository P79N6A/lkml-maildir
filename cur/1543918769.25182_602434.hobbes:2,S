   What does it mean for a C-level bitfield ordering to be little-endian if the
   processor is BIG_ENDIAN?

It makes no sense because a bitfield is something having to
do with a 'C' compiler and it must NEVER be used as a template
to address hardware! 'C' gives no guarantee of the ordering
within machine words. The only way you can access them is
using 'C'. They don't have addresses like other objects
(of course they do exist --somewhere). They are put into
"storage units," according to the standard, and these
storage units are otherwise undefined although you can
align them (don't go there).
If you want to call machine-control bits by name, just
define them as hexadecimal numbers (unsigned ints) and,
if your hardware is for both little/big endian, use
a macro that resolves the issue between the number
and the hardware.
