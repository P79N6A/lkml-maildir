Subject: [PATCH] kswapd performance fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Alan,
here's a one-liner that makes kswapd a little bit faster
by not dirtying cache lines needlessly any more.
The patch should apply to any 2.2 or 2.3 kernel, but for
2.3 it'll have the interesting side effect of nullifying
the (minimal) page aging that's going on there.
Expect a patch for the newest 2.3 tomorrow :)
(if I'm not in a moving frenzy and packing my things
like I should be doing by now)
cheers,
Rik
