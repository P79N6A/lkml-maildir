I dont feel strongly about this, we could certainly change it.
But these are system calls which have per platform bit order anyway - is 
it really an issue? I'd agree that it would be bad for any sort of 
persistent or otherwise cross-platform data such as filesystems, network 
protocol bits, etc.
We use bitfields in a couple of system calls ABIs already, for example in 
PPP:
if_ppp.h-/* For PPPIOCGL2TPSTATS */
if_ppp.h-struct pppol2tp_ioc_stats {
if_ppp.h-       __u16           tunnel_id;      /* redundant */
if_ppp.h-       __u16           session_id;     /* if zero, get tunnel stats */
if_ppp.h:       __u32           using_ipsec:1;  /* valid only for session_id ==
