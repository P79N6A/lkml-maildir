Definitely.  We need a low-risk development environment where we can put
test-fit pieces together, but also not worry too much of we have to rip
pieces out, or completely change them.
I'm not sure we *need* to rewrite things for review-ability later.  I
think some of us have gotten pretty good at keeping our development in
reviewable bits as we go along.
