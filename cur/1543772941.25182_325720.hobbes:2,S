I have encountered kernel oops while testing AIO. 
Since I had set panic_on_oops I  was able to take the memory dump through 
kdump,
I have run preliminary analysis over the dump using gdb and have attached 
the analysis, please look into the bug
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4721
and let me know if further analysis is needed
