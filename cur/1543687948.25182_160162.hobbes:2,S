I omitted to say that I've fixed up most of the non-platform based
PCMCIA socket drivers.  However, this set of patches is waiting on
a response from gregkh/jgarzik on a fix to the PCI save/restore state

In any case, we need to get the platform device situation resolved by
public discussion before making any code changes.
