I just wish you'd bothered to make all this public sooner.  Here I am, having
spent the last couple of months growing a beard to enhance my hackerhood, and
now, just when it's starting to look good, you want me to shave it off!  That's
the whole problem with Linux.  It's about time you stopped using these
undocumented hygiene interfaces and published some solid standards!  (And don't
give me that old excuse about having your pictures right in front of us -- "A
real hacker wouldn't need documentation, he'd just read my face.")
