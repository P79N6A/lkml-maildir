c) semaphores are total overkill for 99% percent of the users.  Remember
this thing about optimizing for the common case?
Pretty much everywhere we do want mutex semantic.  So let's have a proper
primitive exactly for that, and we can keep the current semaphore
implementation (with a much simpler implementation) for that handfull of
users in the kernel that really want a counting semaphore.
I really don't get why you hate mutex primitives so much.
