Is there a reason why we specifically want to make a distinction
between binfmts having and not having VDSOs and do we want aout to
have the possibility of NOT having VDSO when a) It used to have it
unconditionally b) nothing special is needed in arch or common code to
have it and c) Not letting have it requires special arch-specific
code* ?
[*] I see the patch handles i386 and x86_64 - but I am not sure if
something similar will be needed for the other arches to allow aout
executables in absence of VDSO (powerpc, sh).
