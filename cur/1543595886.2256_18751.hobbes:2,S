When Sybase always submits its buffers block aligned (same requirement as
for raw io) you can do it with a simple LD_PRELOAD hack.
I hacked sapdb (which has source available unlike sybase) to do direct IO 
and it seems to not hurt at least.

LVM makes raw partitions much less worse than they used to be. It is 
basically a file system of raw partitions; allowing you to move and resize
them.
