Each root bridge has the ability to route the VGA memory space.  I imagine
only one has that bit set at a time.

I don't think HP supports a configuration other than having the VGA
device on the AGP bus, but there's no reason one couldn't put a VGA
device in every PCI-X slot, is there?

It only requires separate config space.  In practice, you may well
get separate IO port space and/or memory space per domain, or even per
root bus.  On PA-RISC, we extend the IO port space to 24 bit and use
the top 8 bits to determine which PCI root bus we're talking to.

I think some of the NUMAQ stuff can have separate IO port space, but
you'd have to ask someone familiar with the architecture like Martin
Bligh or Bill Irwin.
