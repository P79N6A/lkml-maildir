No recursion is needed because only one acl exists, so that is the only 
one you need to update.  At least on disk.  Any cached acls in memory of 
descendant objects would need updated, but the number of those should be 
relatively small.  The starting point would be the directory you start 
the lookup from.  That may be the root, or it may be some other 
directory that you have a handle to, and thus, already has its effective 
acl computed.

If you want the directory to be root accessible but the files inside to 
have wider access then you set the acl on the directory to have one ace 
granting root access to the directory, and one ace that is inheritable 
granting access to bind.  This latter ace does not apply to the 
directory itself, only to its children.

Yes, if /foo/quux is not already cached in memory, you would have to 
walk the tree to build its acl.  /foo should already be cached in memory 
so this work is minimal.  Is this so horrible of a problem?
As for moving, it is handled the same way as any other event that makes 
cwd go away, such as deleting it or revoking your access; cwd is now 
invalid.

Which would be no different than if they just deleted the entire thing. 
  Your cwd no longer exists.

What's this got to do with acls?  If you are asking what effect the 
umount thas on the acls of the cdrom, the answer is none.  The acls are 
on the disc and nothing on the disc has changed.

Ohh, I see... yes... that is a very clever way for root to misuse 
chroot().  What does it have to do with this discussion?

Same root abuse, same result.  The acl on the cwd would still be exactly 
what it was before the chroot.

Ok, so you found a pedantic corner case that is slow.  So?  And it is 
still going to be faster than chmod -R.

If by falls over you mean takes some time, then yes.... so what?
