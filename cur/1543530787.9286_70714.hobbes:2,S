It is not micromanagement - it is a policy decision that someone has
to make. This decision affects every user, and potentially, the viability
of the company.

Right now, and in a LOT of cases - it kills the "wrong" one, making the
system unusable.

Correct - We Need Resource Quotas - Although Rik's patch makes things
look better sometimes, not always.

No it doesn't - It refuses to spawn more of the daemons (at least it
should - the quota has been exceeded).

If the parent is killed, yes. But the resource quotas have presumably
been computed to support the proper number of slaves. Thus the parent
doesn't die, but the child process (doing a runaway database query for instance)
would. At this point it becomes the job of "per process" quotas rather
than "per user". This particular example MIGHT be handled by currently
existing limits if it weren't for the fact that the SYSTEM cannot control
resource consumption.

Yes - ME THE USER. I should not be able to cause the SYSTEM a problem.
I should not be able to cause OTHER users a problem.

That is possibly why the OOM complaints will not go away.
