Looked a bit closer.
We have more warnings in this area and I see
code where we previously remove the __devinit
annotation.
It looks like we should take all the HOTPLUG only
functions from probe.c and move them elsewhere
(hotplug.c or probe_hotplug.c) and then
only build this file if HOTPLUG is enabled.
This seems like a straightforward solution.
If no-one beats me I will look into that in the weekend.
