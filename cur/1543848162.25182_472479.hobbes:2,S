  Yes, this is certainly one we need to fix.

  Now it is put on the running transaction's BJ_SyncData list. But
otherwise you're right.

  Yes, PageLock should protect us. Where can we call
journal_dirty_data() without PageLock? I see the following callers:
  ext3_ordered_commit_write - should have PageLock
  ext3_ordered_writepage - has PageLock
  ext3_block_truncate_page - has PageLock
  And that are all callers from ext3. Am I missing something?
