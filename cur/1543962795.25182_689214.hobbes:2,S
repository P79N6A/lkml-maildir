Well...  I see what it's trying to do, but it's a bullshit.  Look: it's from
        if (current->files && atomic_read(&current->files->count) > 1)
                sbytes += kobjsize(current->files);
        else
                bytes += kobjsize(current->files);
Now, what we really have is size of current->files (fixed and not too large)
+ if descriptor table is too large to be embedded,
	size of current->files->fdt
	size of current->files->fdt->fd
	size of current->files->fdt->open_fds/->close_on_exec
And the second term there can be *large*, so if we are really serious about
taking descriptor table footprint into account, we'd better take care of
that too.  I'm not sure that we want to, though - note that we do that only
on nommu targets...
So what's that code really trying to achieve?
