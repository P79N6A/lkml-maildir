i updated from rc2-mm3 to rc3-mm2 and now i observe something strange: 
the cpu is running all the time at 100% because of the kswapd0 that is 
running always and not becomming idle. 
after having the computer running for about one hour, top says this about 
kswapd0:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
  155 root      25   0     0    0    0 R 89.6  0.0  38:56.06 kswapd0
the config file you can find here:
