I think that drives retry enough, we should leave retry at zero for 
normal (non-removable) drives. Should this  be a policy we can set like 
we do with NCQ queue depth via /sys ?
We need to be able to layer things like MD on top of normal drive errors 
in a way that will produce a system that provides reasonable response 
time despite any possible IO error on a single component.  Another case 
that we end up doing on a regular basis is drive recovery. Errors need 
to be limited in scope to just the impacted area and dispatched up to 
the application layer as quickly as we can so that you don't spend days 
watching a copy of  huge drive (think 750GB or more) ;-)
