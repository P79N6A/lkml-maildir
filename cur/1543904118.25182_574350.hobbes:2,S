I was mearly quoting the what I'd seen.  I am completely ambivalent on
the whole process.  I had assumed when we updated the documentation to
strongly indicate that this was a style guide not a robot with patch
veto power that people would realise they could ignore those things they
disagreed with and things would be good.	
checkpatch is only intended to tell you what a Reviewer is likely to
pick up and winge about and is intended to save _them_ time, their time
generally being more limited that yours if for no other reason than you
want your patch in, and they may have no vested interest.
That said I want it to be as unannoying as we can and we will have
loosened most of the checks you do not like in the next release.
