With some hacking to produce a polling network driver, it should very
well be possible to provide a communication back-end for a gdb stub
that uses an ethernet NIC.
gdb itself is already perfectly capable of communicating with
such targets, using the specifier
	target remote otherhost:1234
where 1234 is the port number the gdb stub on the target reserves for
itself to communicate with the host. It's probably best to use a
dedicated network interface, though it's not absolutely required. (With
a dedicated interface otherhost will then be the interface's hostname.)
A serious issue is that the communication protocol is somewhat more
complex, so there is a possibility the debug runtime will not be robust.
