I did some additional testing, the results are:
[0e4851502f846b13b29b7f88f1250c980d57e944] r8169: merge with version
8.001.00 of Realtek's r8168 driver
does not work, I after some traffic the transmit timeout occurs.
[6dccd16b7c2703e8bbf8bca62b5cf248332afbe2] r8169: merge with version
6.001.00 of Realtek's r8169 driver
Seems to be the last version to work. I did some stress testing (much
more than the level that was enough to make
[0e4851502f846b13b29b7f88f1250c980d57e944]  break) and am currently
using this version and no problems so far.
