What is your packet size?  How many packets/second are you  forwarding?
I did a lot of testing on 2.4.18 and 2.4.20 kernels with a couple of
different
hardware platforms, using 82543 and 82544 chipsets.  cache
contention/invalidates
due to locks, counters, and ring buffer access becomes the bottleneck.  I
actually verified the
the stats using the cpu performance counters.  As traffic goes up, cache
invalidate increase
and usefull cpu cycles decrease.
I found I was best off to bind the interrupts for each gig-e chip to a
different processor.
That way, only one cpu is accessing the data structures for that interface.
You also not
suffer from packet reordering if you bind the interrupts.
Also, be sure that you have the latest e1000 driver.   If the driver is
refilling the ring buffer
from a tasklet, find a later driver.
Play with the rx interrupt delay until you minimize the interrupts, if
you're not using NAPI.
Be aware that earlier intel chipsets have some problems.  I believe 82543
and earlier
have unreliable rx interrupt delay and can't use more that 256 ring buffers.
I don't have my numbers handy, but I believe I was able to achieve around
400 kpps, 64 byte size,
with a dual cpu dell box with I believe, 1ghz cpus.
By the way, your performance won't scale linearly with cpu speed.  We had a
2.4 ghz dual HT cpu
box from intel for a bit, and it didn't run that much faster.
You may want to search the archives for netdef@oss.sgi.com for some work
being done
on skbuff recycling.   I did some work along those lines, avoiding
constantly allocing
and freeing memory, and it made quite a difference.  It's been a month since
I last looked,
so there may be more progress.
If you happen to turn on vlans, I be curious about your results.  Our
chipsets produced
cisco ISL frames instead of 802.1q frames.  Intel admitted the chipset would
do it,
but 'shouldn't be doing that...'
