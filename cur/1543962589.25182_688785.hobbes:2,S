Andi already answered that one:
"Merging file systems too early can quickly ruin their name and that 
 taint is hard to ever get rid again then (e.g. happened to JFS)"
And a stable kernel shouldn't be something for getting "more testers", 
it should be for tested code ready to be used in production.
What you call "more testers" would be people who try it in production
(e.g. to overcome shortcomings of JFFS2) thinking it was stable.
And no, EXPERIMENTAL in the kernel is not usable for keeping people from 
trying known-whacky code.
