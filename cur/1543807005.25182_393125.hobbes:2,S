And how bad would it be for openvz to move away from the vpid approach ? do
you have any plan for it ?
I've also seen that openvz introduces a 'vps_info_t' object, which looks
like a some virtualization backend. I'm not sure to have well understood
this framework. What the idea behind it ? is it to handle different
implementation of the virtualization ?
thanks,
C.
