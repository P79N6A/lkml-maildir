I was given a tip once to take care of things like this.  After
patching, run make oldconfig which will ask about any new items not in
the old .config file.  Actually what I do is copy the .config file to
/usr/src, then make mrproper, then copy the .config back in, then run
make oldconfig.  That may not be the reccommended way, but it works for
me!
