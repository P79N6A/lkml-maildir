Yeah, this problem is not easy.. I have a set of per architecture
timestamping implementations that detects the limitations of the
hardware and overcomes them (32 bits TSC -> 64 bits extension that
supports read from NMI context, detect TSCs not in sync (AMDs and some
intels) that falls back to what is more or less a logical clock then,
printing warnings. I also keep a recipe cookbook about what people
should disable on these architectures to get precise timestamps.

This is why I use a 2 pass approach in LTTng: the first one, given a
NULL buffer, calculates the reserve size, and then the second pass does
the copy.

The problem with relogging is that it will be a huge timestamping mess.
I doubt that we can reliably continue tracing while we do this copy.
Therefore, we will end up losing events or having timestamps jumping
backward.
A solution that would export the static buffers separately to user-space
and (maybe) allows them to be (somehow?) de-allocated once they have
been read by user-space seems cleaner to me. The switch between the
static buffers and the normal relay buffers could then be done
atomically in a simple pointer overwrite.
