Ok, if the new helper function facility does not imply the breaking of the
previous interface / procedure (i.e., if the current code still works), I
don't see any problem then.
Please note that this is not because of laziness (not that it doesn't
exist, of course ... ;), but because the WAN protocols available in
syncppp are not the only ones in the Linux kernel. Well, I know y'all
understand my (and Madarasz's) point.
