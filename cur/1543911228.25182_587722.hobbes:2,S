Thats makes sense - good catch.

Something like this then:
[PATCH] x86_64: fix preferred-stack-boundary check
gcc has different interpretation of the -preferred-stack-boundary flag
dependent on the option -m64 is present or not as seen in the following:
     # gcc -mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 -S -xc /dev/null  -o FOO
     # echo $?
     0
     # gcc -m64 -mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 -S -xc /dev/null  -o FOO
     /dev/null:1: error: -mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 is not between 4 and 12
     # echo $?
     1
Adding the -m64 to CFLAGS let cc-option do the right thing.
Thanks to Andy Whitcroft <apw@shadowen.org> for spotting the root cause.
