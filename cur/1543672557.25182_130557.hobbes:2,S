Oh, mine's different.  Total lockup with no messages.  Starts a few seconds 
after the yenta module is loaded.  I think it occurs during the yenta probe
but I haven't been able to prove that yet.  
: Ah. I don't use ACPI, because well... it caused me more pain than it helped me 
: in the past, in both OS' on my system (being Linux and win2k)
Yeah, it's a pain but this laptop no longer has APM so I need some way to read
my batteries and soft power the system off.  But, if it weren't for the 
batteries I wouldn't bother because it is a real pain to deal with
