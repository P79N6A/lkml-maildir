I've tried contacting ASUS several times with this issue as I have lots of 
their dual P3 and dual Xeon servers, but end up butting a brick wall, so If 
somebody does have a useful Asus contact, please step forward!
It does raise the issue of exactly what we want out of the kernel though. Ie 
should the kernel just not work with all these asus machines when ACPI is 
enabled, or recognise the problem and fall back to the old discovery 
mechanism.
_I_ can get my asus servers working because 1) I read lkml and am aware of the 
issues 2) Can compile a custom kernel 3) Care enough to keep trying until it 
works. But I'm not normal ;)
And of course The Proprietory OS (tm) seems to manage.
How do the major distros cope? Not enable ACPI at all, or do alot of discovery 
during installation and select an appropriate kernel?
