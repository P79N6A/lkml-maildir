I found the issue that was breaking my amanda dumps.
Using the ip_conntrack_amanda component (either compiled into the kernel
or loaded as a module) corrupts the packets by replacing one LF by a NUL
byte. This in consequence invalidates the checksum, causing the packets
to be discarded.
Workaround: unload ip_conntrack_amanda.
Fix: I've sent a patch in separate mail, Subject:
[BK PATCH] Fix ip_conntrack_amanda data corruption bug that breaks amanda dumps
