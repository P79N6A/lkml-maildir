I suspect that is the case - people seem to be reporting it with other
filesystems too, and it's more likely just a case of "somebody who feels
he needs to set up raid probably is also likely to feel he needs XFS".
That effect is then quite possibly exaggerated by XFS having different IO
patterns than some other loads (ie it is likely that a lot of RAID
developers are themselves using just ext3 and may thus have hit the
"normal" bugs and fixed them already).
