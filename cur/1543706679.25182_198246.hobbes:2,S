Other than allocating a key and bytecode for non-breaking-white-space as a
separator (Hmm.. allocate 'left-windows' purely for ironic value? ;), how do
you propose to actually improve it's knowledge of the distinction?  The basic
problem is that we're overloading x'20' as both space and separator, and then
end up disambiguating based on context and syntax.  And quite frankly, I don't
see much hope for improving things as long as x'20' is overloaded.
Could go the VMS command/this/that/the/other/thing route, I guess?  :)
