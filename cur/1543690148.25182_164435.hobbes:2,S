I get similar crashes with minion.de's patches and the nForce2 AGPGART. I'm in 
the process of tracking it down.
For the moment you can just disable AGPGART in your kernel and use the 
provided NVAGP, Option "NvAGP" "1" in your XF86Config. You will get AGP 8x in 
XFree86, which is probably all you want.
