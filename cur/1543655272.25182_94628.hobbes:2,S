I just tried to run make menuconfig on 2.5.50, on a serial terminal,
and it reports:
Your display is too small to run Menuconfig!
It must be at least 19 lines by 80 columns.
make menuconfig in 2.4.20 works perfectly.
I'm pretty sure I've got the terminal configured correctly - has
anybody experienced this?
