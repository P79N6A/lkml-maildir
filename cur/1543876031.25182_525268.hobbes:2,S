I think I can understand your words. but I need confirm:
Before specific driver register this device, the
fundamental/standard/common(select one by your mind:) driver had already
attach on it likely. At this case, we should detach this hid_device from
its working driver, let this hid_device attach with our new specific
driver. then new driver will handle all input event later, so the your
words is same with the third choice in fact, is it right? if so, the
actual behavior is same with former HID simple interface.
Good luck.
