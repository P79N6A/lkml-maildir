You can already mmap using different pagesize on ppc64.  A certain
infinibad adapter with interesting design choices requires 4k mappings
even on 64k kernels, and for some spu-related mappings on Cell we
want the same.  I'm no expert on the powerpc mmu, but I'd be surprised
if 64k pagecache mappings wouldn't work on 4k base page size kernels.
