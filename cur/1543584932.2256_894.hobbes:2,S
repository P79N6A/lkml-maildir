The automounter could indeed chase those symlinks.
Also, if the automounter creates a symlink in /opt anyway, and the link
subsequently works (as you said), then it shouldn't be returning "No
such file or directory" the first time.
In other words the latter behaviour looks like a bug in the automounter,
and the former is a feature which could be added but isn't needed for
your application.
