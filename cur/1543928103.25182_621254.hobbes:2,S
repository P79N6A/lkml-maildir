I'm not sure who introduced this names (lazy to look to history) but
that's very misleading. Nothing says that while in
AC we cannot do power saving and vice versa. This naming is scattered
all over the code, there should be only one place where AC and BATTERY
are  translated into appropriate (maybe configurable) power levels. We
have 5 power levels defined for iwlwifi.
