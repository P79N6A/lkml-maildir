Thanks Oleg.
I made a small style update - basically removed the helpers
siginfo_from_user() and siginfo_from_ancestor_ns() and moved their
logic into send_signal() (merged patch 4 and 5 from [v6] patchset). 
Also added a patch to update /proc/pid/status to include SIG_DFL
signals and removed a pending todo for the patchset.
Roland, Eric, Daniel, Bastian, can you please comment on the [v7]
patchset ?
Thanks,
Sukadev
