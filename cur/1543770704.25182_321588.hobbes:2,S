Hello Lukasz and Greg,
I'm a graduate student at Portland State University in Prof Bart Massey's
OS Internals Class.  Many of us have been working on the driver for
this chip also and we just recently got SIR working at 9600. We are in
the currently in the process of testing. We would like to join forces,
share what we've done and help with efforts to add support for speed
changes, FIR and more testing.
Judy.
