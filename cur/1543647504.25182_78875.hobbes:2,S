I seem to remember a "drive optimzier" on an old SE Mac. It would move
files and dirs about so that commonly used files all sat together. It
would run in the background too...after the disk was idle for about 5
minuest (configurable, iirc) it would go to work moving things about. It
really helped, as programs and used libs usually all sat in nice self
contained directories. I wounder if load times could be significantly
reduced by having libraries/programs fault in w/o all the seeking that
goes on on X load; as I first test, I guess, I'll have to see if
"prefaulting" all the X/kde dependences in help much.
