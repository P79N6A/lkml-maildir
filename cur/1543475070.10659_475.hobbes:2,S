Hi,
At least on 2.2.0pre4, there's an interesting behavior change with
regards to TCP applications.
The sequence of events:
inetd listen()s on a port
client connect()s and writes to server
inetd exec()s my service
service writes some output and exits without reading
Under 2.0 kernels, the data written by the client is ignored.  When
the server was upgraded to 2.2pre4, the server started responding to
the written (but unread) data with a RST.  This makes the client
unhappy.
Is this change intentional?  Should I fix my application, or does the
kernel need fixing?
Please Cc: me on any replies, as I am not on linux-kernel (but I will
try to follow any discussion in the archives).
Thanks,
-andy
