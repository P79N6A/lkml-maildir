There are two things to check. The first is to do a 'cat /proc/net/wireless' and check the number 
under the word link. The second is to do a 'iwlist scan' command and qheck the "Quality" value. If 
these are both 100%, then it is a problem with the Atheros driver and should be reported as a 
regression to the MadWifi mailing list and/or developers. The rest of the 2.6.22-rc3 kernel is 
functioning correctly.
