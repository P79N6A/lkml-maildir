Hi Jeff.

I don't know about "via the C pre-processor", but you could try one of
the following bash commands:
 1. To detect whether the currently running kernel is from a
    stable series:
	if [ $[`uname -r | cut -d . -f 2`%2] -eq 0 ]; then
		echo STABLE
	else
		echo DEVELOPMENT
	fi
 2. To detect whether the kernel source in /usr/src/linux is
    from a stable series:
	TEST=`grep ^PATCHLEVEL /usr/src/linux/ | head -1`
	if [ $[`echo $TEST | cut -d ' ' -f 3`%2] -eq 0 ]; then
		echo STABLE
	else
		echo DEVELOPMENT
	fi
Best wishes from Riley.
