There are no holes between nodes for any i386 NUMA machines at the moment,
and we don't free back the struct pages for internal holes yet. So we have
pfn_valid set up for i386 such that there's a valid struct page if pfn_valid
is true.

page_is_ram is defined in arch/i386/mm/init.c:
static inline int page_is_ram(unsigned long pagenr)
{
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < e820.nr_map; i++) {
                unsigned long addr, end;
                if (e820.map[i].type != E820_RAM)       /* not usable memory */
                        continue;
                /*
                 *      !!!FIXME!!! Some BIOSen report areas as RAM that
                 *      are not. Notably the 640->1Mb area. We need a sanity
                 *      check here.
                 */
                addr = (e820.map[i].addr+PAGE_SIZE-1) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
                end = (e820.map[i].addr+e820.map[i].size) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
                if  ((pagenr >= addr) && (pagenr < end))
                        return 1;
        }
        return 0;
}
However, we probably want a runtime one that checks some aspect of
the struct page itself to see whether it's a valid memory page or not.
I believe it's useful to have the faster and slower tests still.
Most things using pfn_valid seem to be doing it before a pfn_to_page
translation to check it's safe, and we still seem to have that correct.
pfn_has_struct_page or something might be a better name, but still.
