Hi
I am trying to get a fast NFS server going here. I started fiddling around
with the knfsd code with 2.1.131ac5 - running bonnie and other tests.
It seems that things have slowed down since I first started. The local-disk-io
speeds have increased (bonnie results included here, just for people's
interest).
NFS speeds, however, have dropped slightly. I am not sure why this is (and it's
6am, so I am not going to go crawling throught patches right now - and even
if I did, I would certainly just get everything wrong! :)
2.1.131ac5 seems pretty happy (though I haven't compared it to older versions
Between there and 2.2.0pre1ac1 sequential output has dropped by about
300K per second. 
Sequential per char input has dropped by something near 1 megabyte per second
and sequential block input has by even more. Number of random seeks has also
dropped a little.
Alan has said that the new nfs code sits on the buffer cache. Could the recent
tunings of this have changed things? It's possible that the nfs code hasn't
changed significantly enough to do this (unless someone has plugged in broken
readahead support?).
Info: Two ultra-wide, ultra fast (40MB/s) disks raid-0d together. 256Mb
ram, 1gig bonnie files. I have used the default nfs mount options - no
fiddling with read/write sizes or anything.
LOCAL DISK ACCESS:
Local disk access seems to be pretty stable - it is getting better with time.

ACROSS KERNEL-NFS:
All tests are localhost mounts. Performance seems to have dropped between
kernel 2.1.131 and kernel 2.2.0

here - compared to 2.1.131ac5 WITHOUT the readahead patch. Block throughput
is close to the old user-level nfs patch)

The ac1 changes seem to slow block stuff down further - at least they
speed the random seeks and sequential input a little
