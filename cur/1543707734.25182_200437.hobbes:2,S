I am linux newbie, but have done 100's of kernel compiles the past 2 years.
AFAIK, 2.95.3 is still the official compiler and still supported.
2.95.3 without framepointers compiling kernels for 686 has never failed me
with 2.4 and 2.6 and I still use it exclusively for kernels.
3.2.2 made me lots of trouble with kernels - crashing within minutes.
Using RH 3.2.5 and Gentoo 3.2.3 for other compiles (whole system except kernel
in case of gentoo). No problems seen.
Have not tried 3.3 but by what I have read it is OK.
In any case keep your trusted old workhorse 2.95 around when trying something new...

Michael
