I've discovered some differences between Linux's handling of the
routing table from other Unix and Unix-style OS's, and was wondering
if anyone could shed some light on things.  It's not a bug, really,
just a bit of a misfeature.
I have a program I am working on (high availability/failover stuff),
that as part of it's operation does the following steps:
1. Brings down an interface with 'ifconfig interfacename down'.
2. Depending on circumstances, either brings the interface up with an
   'ifconfig interfacename up', or changes it's IP address and then
   brings it back up with 'ifconfig interfacename up'.
The problem I've run into is that whenever I do an 'ifconfig
interfacename down', the kernel automagically removes all the routing
table entries for that interface.  If I bring the interface back up
with 'ifconfig interfacename up', I also have to run a bunch of route
commands to restore the routing table.
So the problem I have is that I need a way to either:
1. Get the kernel to leave the routing table intact when the interface
   is brought down, or...
2. Find a way to save all the routing table entries involving the
   interface I'm bringing down, and restore them after bringing the
   interface back up?
Anyone know how do do either of these?
On every other Unix OS I've worked, an 'ifconfig interfacename down'
followed by an 'ifconfig interfacename up' restores things to their
initial state, and never changes the routing table.
For example, on one of my old SunOS boxes (with addresses remove to
protect the innocent):
# ifconfig -a
le0: flags=63<UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING>
        inet xx.xx.106.62 netmask ffffff00 broadcast xx.xx.106.0
        ether 8:0:20:23:1e:df 
le1: flags=63<UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING>
        inet xx.xx.196.1 netmask ffffff00 broadcast xx.xx.196.0
        ether 8:0:20:23:1e:df 
lo0: flags=49<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>
        inet 127.0.0.1 netmask ff000000 
# netstat -r

So as you can see, the routing table is completely unaffected by the
'ifconfig' commands on the SunOS machine---it leaves the routes for
the deactivated interface intact even if the interface is down.
On linux (with 2.2.x kernel), I get the following:
bofh:~# ifconfig -a
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:E0:29:21:5A:54  
          inet addr:xx.xx.18.23  Bcast:xx.xx.18.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

          RX packets:34 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:34 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

default         tc8x.router.umn 0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0

As you can see, the ifconfig command is removing my route table
entries, and the route table isn't restored by bringing the interface
back up.  Thus necessitating that I store the routing table, which on
some of my stranger machines is non-trivial.
Ideas?
