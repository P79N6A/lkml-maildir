I would really like raw I/O to make it into the Linux kernel.  Not for
consistency on a raw partition, but for speed through a filesystem.
I can get ~40 MB/s off of a 8-way striped FC array through GFS (on Linux).
On an SGI O2, I can get ~80 MB/s with the same array when using Direct I/O
(their version of raw I/O).  I believe a big part of the difference in speeds
is the memory copy from the buffer cache to user memory.
I would really like a good interface that would allow a filesystem to bypass
the buffer cache on big file data.
