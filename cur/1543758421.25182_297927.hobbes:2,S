I don't know if you can still find them, but the Evergreen upgrade kits 
worked pretty well on my old 486's 
(
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2640
).  It brought the processor up 
to 133 MHz.  Not too shabby for an old PC that would be collecting dust 
in most peoples houses.  I now use it only as a firewall/router for my 
home network; but I'll take whatever speed increases I can get since I 
commonly compile updates directly on that system.  I needed iptables, so 
I'm running a 2.4.2? kernel.  The only time this system goes down is 
when the power goes out (no UPS yet).  I think the longest I've made it 
is about two months.  I'm quite certain I could have uptimes as high as 
a year or more if I had a battery.
Talk to you later,
