Subject: [BUG] loop device problem in 2.2

Hi,
  I observe a problem with loop block device over a sparse file grater than
2GB on alpha. When write attempts to the device appear (probably only at
offset greater than 2GB), the filesysstem where the loop device file is
located gets corruptted. i observe this eg. while doing
mke2fs /dev/loop0
I think it is either loop or ext2 problem...
Up till now I have tested 2.2.20pre2 and 2.2.19 kernels.
1. Is this a known problem ?
2. If so, is there any way to fix it ?
Andrzej
