How many goats did you have to sacrifice to get that to work?  I like it with
just one very minor niggle: if CONFIG_BLOCK=y, CONFIG_MTD=y, CONFIG_ROMFS_FS=y
CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y and CONFIG_ROMFS_ON_BLOCK=y then the CONFIG_ROMFS_ON_BLOCK
configuration item disappears and reappears depending on the state of
CONFIG_ROMFS_ON_MTD.  But, as I said, it's a very minor niggle.
