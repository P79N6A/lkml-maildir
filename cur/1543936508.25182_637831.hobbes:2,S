Hi Bart,
here are the remaining patches which had issues to be worked out. I decided
to keep the Flexible Disk Page and Capacity Descriptor in
idefloppy_floppy_t for the sake of the two printk calls for which they are
used. Otherwise, we'll be changing long-known driver behavior and this won't
be acceptable. I'll audit the driver to see whether rq_data_dir() can replace
the PC_WRITING flag completely and get rid of that one too.
By the way, I have an Iomega ZIP 100 drive somewhere in my hardware pile and
will do some testing with the "new" :) driver just in case.
