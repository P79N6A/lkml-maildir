No, atkbd does not need to ACK anything, it is keyboard controller
ACKs commands set to it. Normally there is only one owner of a serio
port and atkbd rightfully complains when it gets ACks from keyboard
controller when it does not expect it. However during panic we cut
in the middle and start sending kommands to the keybaord without atkbd
knowledge. Keyboard ACKs commands we sent to it and these ACKs reach
atkbd causing it to complain.
Somehow you get 2 ACks in a row, I wonder if on your boxes i8042 pumps
command and data into keyboard before i8042_interrupt gets a chance to
run. Could you please apply the debug patch below and tell me the
pattern of the data flow.
Thank you.
