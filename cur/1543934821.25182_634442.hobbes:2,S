Huhrmm? OK, let me ask this then:
So what you're saying is that the address is only initially wrong
(e.g. due to card EEPROM content somehow initializing the registers
in wrong order on power-on), it's not _always_ supposed to be stored
in wrong order during operation.
IOW, the default card state after power-on is _unusable_ (due to
invalidly ordered MAC address) and has to be _corrected_ by the driver,
_initially_ only?
OTOH I know that at least acx100 has a _permanently_ wrong-ordered
MAC address setup, i.e. it's required to have it in "wrong" order
_during operation_. And I wouldn't be surprised to see several examples
of other hardware having a permanently wrongly-ordered address
requirement, given the amount of MAC reversal in Linux drivers.
Couldn't it be by chance that it's _believed_ to be reversed-on-power-on only,
whereas those cards should _actually_ have it reversed-during-lifetime
instead? Such a misunderstanding might explain a lot of trouble...
Obviously I was expecting the latter case, which my code layout proposal
was supposed to support in a clean way.

If it's indeed reversed-on-power-on only, then one probably cannot do
much about it, thus I'd give up and simply check the MAC address for
validity (should be very easy to check for a simple reversal by
checking for the manufacturer-specific fingerprint in reverse order).
Keeping _any_ sort of state to record the fact that it used to be reversed
or now is reversed is futile (or rather: catastrophic) given the complexity of
suspend / virtualisation or whichever other nice operations Linux may invent
in the future ;)

You most likely did more analysis than me, I just said
"this very obviously must be the problem" and replied ;)
