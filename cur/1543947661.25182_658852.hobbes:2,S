Actually, unfortunately, it was ... I just didn't spot it.  The second
patch has this in the header:
diff --git a/drivers/scsi/mvsas.c b/drivers/scsi/mvsas.c
old mode 100644
new mode 100755
It's git slang for change the mode to executable ... no idea why marvell
would do that unless it's something windows related?  Anyway, I'll
change it back.
