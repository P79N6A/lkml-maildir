Yes indeed:
ls 	DIR
cp 	COPY
mv      REANME
cat     TYPE

The reaons is that it is making the splitup betwen the enumeration
and naming part very easy. Not just for scripts but for C code as well.
Numbers get user quite frequently for versioning as well.
And I tought the above should be mainly used by programs?
