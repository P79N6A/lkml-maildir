Actually you'd have to add 3 x NNN to get a roughly correct number.
But then there's the question what you want to measure. Now you are 
measuring the amount of patches (that is already printed in the 
announcements). If you want to measure the amount of changes, you should 
better substract this from the older ones instead of adding it to the 
newer ones.
The next problem is that e.g. in BK times, Greg's trees were only a few 
lines of the announcement, while now every single patch in his trees is 
listed...
