This is the sort of bug where everyone sits in stunned silence because we
don't have any idea of who broke it.
It would be great if you could help us fix it, but it will take some time.
First step: please add `initcall_debug' to the kernel boot command line so
we get a better idea of where it failed.
Second step: try older kernels.  2.6.12, 2.6.16, etc.  If one of those
works OK then we know that we can find the buggy change via git-bisect.
Thanks.
