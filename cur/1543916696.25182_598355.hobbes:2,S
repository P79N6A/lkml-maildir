hm.  I saw that warning on my 2-way.  It has CONFIG_NR_CPUS=8 so perhaps
the kernel has decided that this machine can possibly have eight CPUs.
It's an old super-micro board, doesn't have ACPI.

APIC timer registered as dummy, due to nmi_watchdog=1!
checking TSC synchronization [CPU#0 -> CPU#1]: passed.
Brought up 2 CPUs
One would think that the kernel would work out that eight CPUs ain't
possible on such a machine.  But we don't seem to print out any info which
allows me to confirm that this is really what the kernel did.
