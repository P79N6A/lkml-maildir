And who are most likely far more intrusive than XFS is currently, or have
other issues. [1]

So they mark XFS experimental, and unless the user configures for
experimental features to be asked for they won't even notice their presence.

So, you are not using ext2 then either? Since that can loose files, too, on
a crash. (I've actually even once seen a whole ext2 partition disappear
after a crash. Same for reiserfs, BTW)
Any fs can have bugs. Even while ext2 is indeed more likely to be the most
tested, it too can bite you sometimes. [1]

[1] Actually I've had problems with dma timeouts resulting in ide hangs on
    an ext2 system last week, and it too managed to lose a few files. Sure,
    fsck picked up most of them, and none were critical, but it does prove
    my point well enough.
