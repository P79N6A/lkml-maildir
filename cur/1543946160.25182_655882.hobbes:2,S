I know very well what unaligned access is. As I said the code
works on MIPS, which can't do unaligned accesses.
The _real_ question is, why doesn't align the compiler the stuff properly
on ARM? It does the right thing on x86_32/64, powerpc and MIPS. Why doesn't
it do the right thing on ARM and we have to manually align stuff?
See section "Code that doesn't cause unaligned access"
