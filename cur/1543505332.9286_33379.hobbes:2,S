I can say I have never seen this before...
Suspend at August 8, 1999 20:53:43
Resume at September 23, 1991 10:33:11  ?????
Has anyone seen this before?  
Suspend/resume is my normal method of operation... 
Linux tawman 2.2.9-ac4 #43 Sat Jun 26 15:49:43 CEST 1999 i686 unknown
I have been running this kernel.. solidly since Jun 26th..... no
problems... this is why I am still using 2.2.9-ac4.
From syslog:
Aug  8 20:53:40 localhost cardmgr[2755]: executing: './network suspend
eth0'
Aug  8 20:53:41 localhost cardmgr[2755]: executing: './serial suspend
ttyS3'
Aug  8 20:53:42 localhost cardmgr[2755]: executing: './network suspend
eth1'
Aug  8 20:53:43 localhost cardmgr[2755]: executing: './serial suspend
ttyS1'
Sep 23 10:33:10 localhost apmd[73]: Resume after 4294964420 days,
4294967286:4294967276:4294967266 (98% 3:16)
Sep 23 10:33:11 localhost cardmgr[2755]: executing: './network resume
eth0'
Sep 23 10:33:11 localhost cardmgr[2755]: executing: './serial resume
ttyS3'
Sep 23 10:33:12 localhost cardmgr[2755]: executing: './network resume
eth1'
Sep 23 10:33:12 localhost cardmgr[2755]: executing: './serial resume
ttyS1'
My only guess is an integer problem...
2^32 = 4294967296 vs. Resume after 4294964420 days
bizzaro world.
Sincerely,
Todd.
