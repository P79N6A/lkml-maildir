Well, I don't share the hatred for ioctl, at least compared to another
type unsafe interface like write().
But John and I are open to doing whatever is the consensus.  If there is
an agreed alternative, and that is the requirement for merging, I'll do
it.
I'd like to keep the user-space interface and simple, and absolutely
want to keep the single file descriptor approach.  How the fd is
obtained is up for discussion.
Ingo, what do you prefer?
Best,
