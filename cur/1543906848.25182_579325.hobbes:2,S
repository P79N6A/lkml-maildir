Linux has always been a "POSIX unless its stupid" type of system.  For 
the upstream kernel, we should do the right thing -- noatime by default 
-- but allow distros and people that care about rigid compliance to 
easily change the default.

Though strictly in the context of atime vs. noatime, servers benefit 
from that too, not just desktop.
