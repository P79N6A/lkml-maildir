Sorry, I couldn't resist.
1) "Solaris running on more processors"? Think of Beowulf clusters.
   Strangely enough, people running them choose Linux as the kernel.
2) "QNX is real-time", true. Linux is not. Please don't compare apples with
   oranges.
3) "Windows has more apps"? True. Is it a kernel property of any kind? No.
4) "MacOS has better color and font management" this is funny as it speaks
   for itself. I'd also add "MacOS is usually housed in a better-looking
   case". Luckily enough, under Linux color and font management is NOT a
   kernel job. No more than the external design of the case, I mean.
And I really hope Linux will *never* be exactly the same as Solaris,
technically.

From "The design and implementation of the Perfect OS 1.0", yet to be
published. The good thing about this book is that there will never be
a second edition. Of course the only release of Perfect OS will be 1.0!
