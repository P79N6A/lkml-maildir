Hi!
My SMP machine crashes after an "Unknown interrupt" occured.
After that one CPU hangs and later the system crashes completely :-(
Other people also have this problem ...
The "Unknown interrupt" message comes from "head.S". How can I get 
the number of the interrupt?
Could someone make a patch, please? I've no knowledges in programming 
x86 assembler - sorry :-(
Gerald

The box said "Requires Win95, NT, or better," and so I installed Linux.
