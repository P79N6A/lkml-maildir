Sounds like gcc should get fixed. I once used a so-called 'C'
compiler which would barf if it found '%' anywhere, not
in quotes.
The so-called meta-char was used to "expand macros" that
were compiler-specific. I contacted the company, Intermetrics,
and they called it a feature. Strangely, they are still in
business, recently awarded a 3 million software contract by
NASA for "spacelink". Go figure. They probably have fixed their
crap by now because NASA isn't that dumb. GCC should probably
do the same.
