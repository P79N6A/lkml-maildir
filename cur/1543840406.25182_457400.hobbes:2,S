This may not solve the problem, as 
 - we won't be able get the controller data structure given the
   beancounter data structure. 
 - we need to keep the data in sync (since there are multiple copies).
 - we will be copying the whole beancounter data structure needlessly
   (the controller might care only about _its_ parameters).
I agree with you that this can be added later when needed. The problem I
see is that this might need some change in the core data structure which
might face more resistance (than it does now :) once it is in mainline.
