I have a retiered BP6 at home I could try to bring up this weekend.  The only 
problem is that I haven't been able to boot a 2.6 kernel from the HPT 366 
attached drive it as the device id's seem to have been shuffeled about on me.  
hdd goes to something else or so i thought before I gave up on the thing.
I could put 2 IDE's in it one on the 366 and one on the chipset IDE 
controllers to get the thing to boot up.
just let me know.
