Of course, but as you said below these changes happen very rarely 
indeed.

Eventually there comes a time when you can remove the old interfaces 
when they are no longer desirable for maintanance reasons.

Exactly! If the interfaces really are very stable and hardly ever 
change, then what the hell is all the fuss about actually *defining* 
what the currently API's are so that binary compatibility can be 
assured?
