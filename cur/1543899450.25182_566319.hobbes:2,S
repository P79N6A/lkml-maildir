No.
notify_change() does *not* do permission checks for 
ATTR_CTIME/MTIME/ATIME.
It does them for the "xxx_SET" attributes, but MTIME/ATIME is expected to 
change when other things change, so notify_change() expects that those 
_other_ changes have been validated from a security standpoint!
utimes() is special.
