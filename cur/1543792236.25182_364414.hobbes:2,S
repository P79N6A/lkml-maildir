Wow.  It's amazing how these things spread from my little corner of the
universe ;)  What you speak of sounds dangerously close to what I've
been working on lately.  Indeed it is not standard at all yet.  
I am currently working on an new approach to what you tried.  It
requires fewer changes to the kernel and implements the special large
page usage entirely in an LD_PRELOAD library.  And on newer kernels,
programs linked with the .x ldscript you mention above can run using all
small pages if not enough large pages are available.
For the curious, here's how this all works:
1) Link the unmodified application source with a custom linker script which
does the following:
  - Align elf segments to large page boundaries
  - Assert a non-standard Elf program header flag (PF_LINUX_HTLB)
    to signal something (see below) to use large pages.
2) Boot a kernel that supports copy-on-write for PRIVATE hugetlb pages
3) Use an LD_PRELOAD library which reloads the PF_LINUX_HTLB segments into
large pages and transfers control back to the application.

I have used this method on ppc64, x86, and x86_64 machines successfully.
I'd love to see how my system works for a real-world user so if you're
interested in trying it out I can send you the current version.
