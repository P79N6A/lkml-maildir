I don't think there is very much __exit code around in general.
e.g. a fairly fat x86-64 kernel here has a little over 5K.

The problem is we would need separate exception tables for this then
or teach binutils about not warning. Hardly worth it for 5K.
In general it's more useful to focus on the real memory pigs 
(and measure first who they are) if you want to save memory.
