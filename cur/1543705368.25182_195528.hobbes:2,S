It doesn't work for me. During "write cache" phase, at 75% of the
progress bar, my powerbook powers off the LCD backlight and it seems
locked... at this point I can only power off the system...  Any idea?
BTW, I cannot compile your patch with highmem support. It will be very
useful for me...
I've also tried the benh's pmdisk patch and it works fine but it lacks
highmem support too.
TIA,
Marco
