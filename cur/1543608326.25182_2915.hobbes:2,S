Interesting though: I had exactly the same error with gcc 3.0.1, but
for me 3.0.2 has compiled that file correctly in a couple of
13-ac releases, including -ac5.  The resulting kernels are about 8%
bigger, and seem a trifle slower, than the same ones compiled with
2.95.3 -- IIRC other people have found the same, so maybe the easy
fix is to wait a few versions before using gcc 3 for kernel
compilation.
