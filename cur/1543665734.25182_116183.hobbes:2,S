It's a little bit more complicated...
The thing crashes in the TAILQ_REMOVE macro, in ahc_runq_tasklet :
		TAILQ_REMOVE(&ahc->platform_data->device_runq, dev, links);
I tracked it down to the last line of TAILQ_REMOVE :
#define	TAILQ_REMOVE(head, elm, field) do {				\
	if ((TAILQ_NEXT((elm), field)) != NULL)				\
		TAILQ_NEXT((elm), field)->field.tqe_prev = 		\
		    (elm)->field.tqe_prev;				\
	else								\
		(head)->tqh_last = (elm)->field.tqe_prev;		\
	*(elm)->field.tqe_prev = TAILQ_NEXT((elm), field);		\
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            \ It crashes here
} while (0)
The thing is, if I put enough printks before the macro, it slows the
thing down (9600 bauds serial console effet, maybe), and the machine
comes up.
So it looks like a race of some sort... Concurent tasklets effect ?
Any idea ?
