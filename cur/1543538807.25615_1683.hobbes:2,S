I finally got a kernel after 2.4.0-test3 to compile (it also booted just
fine).  So I started X to make sure it worked too.  It seemed to work
fine.  So I quit X.  I was left staring at a blank screen, not even a
blinking cursor.  So before panicing, I blindly typed "reset" and bingo
everything came back just fine.
I think this is probally caused by the 3DFX DRM driver.  I don't need it
(and I think I've heard that it doesn't even work right now), so I can
compile it out of my kernel.  But just to let who ever know what I have
seen.
Oh, BTW, I'm running XFree 4.01 if that has any berring.
Thanks,
Chris
