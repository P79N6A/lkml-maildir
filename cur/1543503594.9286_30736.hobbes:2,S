That took care of the problem.  Evidently, what Matthias described is
exactly what occurred when I added the Cyrix coma bugfix code back into
2.3.10, i.e., the kernel compression characteristics were changed just
enough to allow things to work.  The same trick wasn't effective to
allow 2.3.11 to boot in my case.
Let's *do* raise the heap size a bit.  0x3000 was effective for me.
Didn't try a smaller increment.
FYI, the problem has shown up on another machine I use that has the
"officially blessed" compiler setup: gcc-2.7.2.3.  This isn't a gcc
issue, nor is it a Cyrix-specific issue as I originally thought.
