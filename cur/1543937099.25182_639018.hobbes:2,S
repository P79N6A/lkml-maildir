Right... But, with something like this:
... have_some_fun(... cls)
{
	mutex_lock_nested(&cls->mutex, SINGLE_DEPTH_NESTING);
	have_other_fun(cls);
	mutex_unlock(&cls->mutex);
}
... have_more_fun(...)
{
	...
	mutex_init(&cls->mutex);
	mutex_lock(&cls->mutex);
	have_some_fun(cls);
	mutex_unlock(&cls->mutex);
}
probably you wouldn't get any lockdep warning too...
Of course, if we know all the locking is right such proper lockdep
annotating shouldn't matter too much. (And of course this could be
improved later.)
