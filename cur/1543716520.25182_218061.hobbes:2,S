Does the rule have to be that all sys_FOO() entry-points must be
exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL()?  Otherwise we have the strange issue
where a kernel-module may not be able to (easily) invoke a system call
which it could formerly invoke via _syscallN().  For example, the ATI
driver wants to call mlock()/munlock().  While this happens to be a
proprietary/binary-only driver, the same issue can arise with GPL'd
modules.

In my opinion, it would be good to remove _syscallX() altogether.
