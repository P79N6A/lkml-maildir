Alan already has integrated 6.1.11 into his kernels.  6.1.13
corects an issue with cdrecord and improves read performance on
U160 cards, so I'll ping Alan about syncing up.  I've sent Linus
patches post 6.1.5 in the past, but I think he's been too
busy with other issues to push them through.  I'll ping him too.
