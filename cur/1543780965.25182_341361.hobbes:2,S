That idea is already changing from the first line of the patch. 
And the change is "allowing the load to grow upto the sched 
group's cpu_power"

Second part of the patch is just a logical extension of the
first one.

We are talking about lightly loaded case anyway. We are not changing
the behavior of a heavily loaded system.

We will do that already with the first line in the patch. 
If we want to distribute uniformly among the memory controllers, 
cpu_power of the group should reflect it (shared resources bottle neck).

My first patch is a simple straight fwd one.
