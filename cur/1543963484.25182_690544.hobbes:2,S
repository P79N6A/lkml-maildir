Also, note that we only look for start while looking at fixed range MTRRs.
This is not as scary as it seems. We are finding the effective memory type
by just looking at the start of the address range. We still go through
the PAT reserve free mechanism, once we find the effective memory type
and that list will catch any other users with conflicting type anywhere
in the start to end range. And we will still keep effective type consistent
across all mappings.
For example:
0xf0000000-0xf1000000 is mapped WC by one user with appropriate MTRR setting
0xf2000000-0xf3000000 is mapped UC by another user with appropriate MTRR setting
Now if there is a request to map
0xf0000000-0xf4000000, we do mtrr_lookup and assume effective type for the
whole range is WC. Then we go through PAT list to see any conflicts. And
while parsing the list, we will find there is an overlap with conflicting
attributes and we fail the reserve.
In case the second UC mapping above is not present, we use effective memory
type for the whole range 0xf0000000-0xf4000000 as WC and track it in our list
that way.
