Hmmmmmmm.  page_address() is already 5 loads (on ARM) if page->virtual
isn't used.  I'm seriously considering changing page_address() to cover
the 3 cases more efficiently:
1. non-discontiguous case (should be around 2 loads + math)
2. discontiguous case (currently 5 loads + lots of math)
3. weirder setups where loading page->virtual is faster
We currently ignore (1) completely, and just assume its the same as (2).
