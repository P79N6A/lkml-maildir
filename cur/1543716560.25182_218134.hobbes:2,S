Bill,
(replying to:

I don't have mailbox access to your email ATM)
I wish that I had a way to test this patch.
Apparently Willy does, so I recommend his patch.... :)
with one change:
change
+static int setuptime;	/* time(ms) to let devices set up before root mount */
to
+static int setuptime = 10000;	/* time(ms) to let devices set up before root mount */
or 60000 (= 1 minute).  Whatever is comfortable for you.
Willy, it seems that some default value would be good there.
Later,
