Hello,
I'm looking at a kernel driver module which makes use of the gcc-ism of
"long long" to represent a 64-bit variable on 32-bit architectures.  I
assume that this takes some kind of performance hit or other undesirable
side-effect, or else it would be used more often. :-)  What are the reasons
to _not_ use this variable type within the kernel?
thanks,
-bp
