This is a disaster waiting to happen, and I would be against adding
such functionality to Linux.  It would allow userspace applications
to implement a denial of service to any file that they can open (e.g.
open("/lib/libc-2.7.so", O_DENYREAD) would be really bad :-).
It was always also a pain in the ass on Windows systems (back when I used
them) that backing up the filesystem would fail because something (app or
kernel) had files open in this mode and the backup tool couldn't even read
them to do the backup.  In some cases these files were opened very early
in boot and the only way to do a full backup was to boot from a separate
device and run the backup.  Not my idea of fun.
I can't see any reason for O_DENYREAD or O_DENYWRITE that can't be met
with existing file locking to maintain coherency if that is really needed.
As for O_DENYDELETE - wouldn't that be irrelevant if the WINE code keeps
an open file reference?  The data would still be accessible until WINE
exits, and it wouldn't be a DOS.
Cheers, Andreas
