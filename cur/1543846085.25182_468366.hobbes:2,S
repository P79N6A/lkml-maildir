Unlike 98% of the warnings of this type, this gcc warning does indeed 
seem to indicate a bug:
drivers/atm/zatm.c: In function ‘zatm_open’:
drivers/atm/zatm.c:919: warning: ‘pcr’ may be used uninitialized in this 
function
If alloc_shaper() argument 'unlimited' is true, then pcr is never 
assigned a value.  However, the caller of alloc_shaper() always tests 
the pcr value, regardless of whether or not 'unlimited' is true.
