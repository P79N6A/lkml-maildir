Hi,
I just got a lockup in X windows, (black screen,
nothing works but the power off button still works)
when compiling Lyx and running several program
(LimeWire, Mozilla). Unfortunately I can not have any
informative message yet, just I found in
/var/log/message this line when reboot
 __alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed (gfp=0
x1d2/0) from c012f7a6
This is 2.4.10 with prempt patch and vm1 tweak form
Andre.
