I have applied your patch against kernel 2.4.16
This was the message:
(Stripping trailing CRs from patch.)
patching file drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_linux.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 625 (offset 1 line).
Hunk #3 succeeded at 1714 (offset 1 line).
Then I built a kernel with hi mem support, and vfat driver built as a module.
reboot machine with new kernel.
Root login, modprobe vfat (modutils 2.4.12) and I always get this message:
Warning: loading /lib/modules/2.4.16/kernel/fs/vfat/vfat.o will taint the kernel: no license
Then I try I mount the vfat filesystem:
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
and when I try to copy a file from the vfat FS to the linux root FS I get this kernel panic message
code: 0f 0b 80 4f 07 80 8b 03 8b 53 2c 83 ca 82 89 50 14 8b 13 8b

ebx, edi, ebp values change at every panic.
Hope this help you.
