It tries to patch an instruction past the kernel text.
It could be in the discarded .exit.text/.text.exit. With new binutils you should
get an link error when this happens, but perhaps yours are too old for that.
When you comment these entries out from the DISCARD statement in 
arch/i386/vmlinux.lds.S does it go away ? Alternatively use Andrew's
latest 2.5.69-mm*, that has the patch too.
