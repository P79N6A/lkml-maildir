"memory x 2" is probably a good rule. With normal usage patterns, at the
point you fully use up your swap, you _want_ the system to start killing
things off due to out-of-memory errors.
But there really is no "fixed" rule: it can depend a lot on your usage
patterns. Some people have a lot of big background processes that don't
have a big active footprint but that have a lot of "idle" pages that can
successfully be swapped out - using up tons of swap-space without
actually causing any bad behaviour.
And you might end up adding more memory..
