You should probably mention that it is not necessary to run git-pack-refs 
by hand: git-gc is what you want.
BTW have I praised y'all for inventing git-gc? It is _awesome_. I think I 
will turn into a DWIM geek yet; it is soooo much more convenient to issue 
"git gc" from time to time, than to think exactly about what I want to 
clean up right now.

Should we introduce "git config" in time for the "let's please end-users" 
release (1.5.0)?

... (use "git push <remote> :refs/heads/<branch>" to delete "branch".)

It might make sense to enable something similar for git-fetch in time for 
1.5.0.

It might make sense to reformulate that:
	Reflog records the history from the view point of the local 
	repository. In other words, regardless of the real history,
	the reflog shows the history as seen by one particular repository
	(this enables you to ask "what was the current revision in _this_
	repository, yesterday at 1pm?").

Did I mention that I really _love_ git-gc?

I am no native speaker, but should that not be "we have a C 
implementation" instead?

I fully expect people to complain that a config like this
	format.suffix = .txt
does not work. better say ...
	or setting the config variable "format.suffix" to ".txt".

Amen. I think this really helped a lot of people already.

Maybe we should go the "restrict first, and loosen later" approach? I.e. 
forbid git-upload-pack to run if is_repository_shallow()?

Maybe forbid git-push and git-receive-pack to run if 
is_repository_shallow()?
(I _think_ git-push should be safe, but not git-receive-pack.)
