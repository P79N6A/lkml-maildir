I bet pcmcia works without hotplug ;-)
IMHO the worst thing that might happen without hotplug would be one has to 
modprobe some drivers for CardBus cards by hand. But maybe I'm missing 
something because I'm not using hotplug...
Anyway, I really hope the network-hotplug deadlock issue gets resolved 
before 2.6.0 or we'll see quite a number of such reports then...
