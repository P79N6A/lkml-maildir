  I don't want to get into politics on this, but wasn't Albert the
maintainer of procps? I think I saw him state that you guys started
releasing your own versions instead of sending him patches,
  I can't find a maintainer's name in any of the not so old versions I
have here, so I am just replaying my recollection of his statement as a
question.
  For what it's worth, both recent versions seem to work, his top is far
prettier;-)
