We copy a cpuset by value?

Yes, we already do.
That thing contains spinlocks and list_heads (at least), which cannot
be copied in this way.
Seems that we're doing this gross thing because it just so happens that
we only use the cpus_allowed and mems_allowed fields, and because
several of the called functions require a cpuset*, but only needed a
cpumask_t.
How perfectly beastly.
