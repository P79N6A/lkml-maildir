Subject: 2.6 - Kernel panic with GRE tunneling

Hello,
I encountered some kernel bug in the ip_gre module. This problem has
been tested on: 2.6.0-test3, 2.6.0-test4-mm2, 2.6.0-test4-mm4 (In VMWare
to get stacktrace).
All kernels were build with gcc 3.3 (the latest with 3.3.2 20030831
Debian prerelease). Tested on 2 systems (one was a VMWare), both running
Debian Sid.
this is what I did:
modprobe ip_gre
ip tunnel add test mode gre remote 10.2.0.1 local 10.2.248.255
ip link set test up
ip addr add 192.168.0.1 dev test
ip route add 192.168.0.2/32 dev test
ping 192.168.0.2
***crash***
In order to limit the e-mail's size:
http://brains.student.utwente.nl/~iq-0/ipgre-2.6-panic/
there are the paniclog, an attempt to run it through ksymoops and a
tcpdump.
*note: In this test case I didn't set up the other end-point of the
tunnel (because the other system is also 2.6 ;), but on a real life
tunnel the same thing happened. But one doesn't liketo crash his/her
system more than 10 times a week...
Regards,
justin....
