If you're thinking about investing in this platform (I personally wouldn't 
recommend investing in a chipset architecture at launch, but I guess if 
people have money and time to burn..), just go for it. The transition from 
nForce3 S754 to nForce4 S939 was unnoticable, and I suspect (especially for 
NVIDIA boards) that the transition between S939 and AM2 sockets will be 
negligible. You might find some hardware doesn't work at launch, but you can 
help the list fix that up.
