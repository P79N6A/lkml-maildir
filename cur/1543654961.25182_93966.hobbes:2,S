I don't know.  Then for every bus specific driver, they would have to do
the "dereference the structure" logic before they can start to determine
if they should bind to this specific device.  That's all the PCI and USB
code really does, strip out the proper structures that are relevant to
the specific bus type, and then call the driver.
So in the end you would probably have a lot of duplicated code that
would be better off being in one place, like it is today :)

That seems a bit overkill.  The bus specific code can add those
architecture setup hooks right now if it's needed, right?
