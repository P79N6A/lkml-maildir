For information: this is 2.5.64 + sched-2.5.64-B2, no preempt or other
patches.
I changed the command that sawfish executes to only append the current
date to a file and then I made it take a nap again.
I got a file containing 57 lines, one for each time the command was
executed by sawfish.
it took 41 seconds to execute the command 57 times and the machine was
very idle during that time.
According to top sawfish's priority is between 15 and 20 the whole time.
And as I said the machine is very idle during the test.
The command was a very small bashscript:
#!/bin/bash
date >> /tmp/result
So no aumix executed in the script, didn't want another error factor in
the test.
I've reproduced the problem three times and this is what I got:

    57        41 seconds

Do you have any clues to what might be happening?
