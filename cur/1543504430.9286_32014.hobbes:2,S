Thank you for prompt reply.  It's really great thing that we can reach
the author in that way.
Well, I've read the spec, of Unix98 and O'Reilly's "POSIX.4".  You're
right that RT process should never "yields" to a SCHED_OTHER process.
However, the case which Suzaki-san provided is two _RT_ processes.
In the current (2.2.10) implementation (with the "if" clause), RT
process never yields (even to the another RT process).  That's the
point I'd like to point out.
How do you think?
