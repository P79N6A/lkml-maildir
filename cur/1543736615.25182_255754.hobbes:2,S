Zwane,
As far as irq_affinity is concerned, workaround fits nicely in quirks.c
infrastructure.
x86 irqbalance is the one which is causing the pain. Workaround will be more
cleaner if we can move balanced_irq_init() to late_initcall.
If there is no objection, I can post a new patch with that change.
thanks,
suresh
