This is a initialization order problem then, because:
	arp_init
	   neigh_table_init
		rwlock_init
does the initialization already. So fix the initialization sequence
of the qeth driver or you will have other problems.
My impression was the -rt folks wanted all lock initializations t be
done at runtime not compile time.
