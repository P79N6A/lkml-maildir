This was very much done on purpose. The theory is, that if you're low on
memory and have a lot of pages mapped, you will see enough TLB trashing
for this to not matter.
And if you aren't low on memory, or don't have a lot of pages mapped, it 
_also_ doesn't matter.

Yeah, all hail bad MMU's.
Hash tables may need some kind of "not very urgent TLB flush" thing, so 
that it doesn't penalize sane architectures.
