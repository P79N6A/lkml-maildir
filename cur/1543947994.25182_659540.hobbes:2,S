Can you please add
http://linux-m68k-cvs.ubb.ca/~geert/linux-m68k-patches-2.6/series?
So far there's only one patch in between NEXT_PATCHES_{START,END} yet,
though.

Ah, I see the m68k cross-compiler is still missing? ;-)
Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

P.S. For the interested, a script to update the SHA1 in the quilt series file:
anakin$ cat $(type -p quilt-update-git-base)
#!/bin/bash
series=patches/series
if [ ! -f $series ]; then
    echo Cannot find $series
    exit 1
fi
if head=$(git rev-parse --verify HEAD); then
    if grep '^# BASE' $series > /dev/null; then
	sed -i -e "s/^# BASE.*$/# BASE $head/" $series
	echo Updated BASE to $head
    else
	echo No BASE found
    fi
fi
anakin$

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
