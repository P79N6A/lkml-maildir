FWIW, I determine whether I should rebase or merge based on
 + Whether the branch/head I maintain is public. For public repos, I
*must* merge carefully as rebase "rewinds" the head and that makes a
mess of any repositor tracking me.
 + Whether the changes on my both sides are significant, and it is
semantically meaningful to have a merge. If either side had just a
couple of minor commits, rebase makes life a lot easier down the path.
If both side clearly saw parallel development, it is more sincere to
merge and let that be recorded.
 + If my attempt to rebase leads to any non-trivial conflicts or
co-dependencies, then I definitely cancel the rebase and merge.

I'd argue that it is not about distributed or not. It's all in what
you want to record in your history. As such, it is a communication
device -- and I want to make effective use of it. I guess the question
I ask myself is: what will communicate what's happened here most
clearly? What will be useful for people to read? In that context, a
white-lie here and there simplifying the history a bit where it's not
interesting counts as a good thing.
