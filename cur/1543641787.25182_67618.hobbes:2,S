I think we are agreeing: POSIX mqueues are not perfectly designed to be

No, it is more complicated than that.  They can be compromised by an
arbitrary process if the permissions on the mq include S_IWOTH.
That is the fundamental problem with a userspace shared memory
implementation: write permissions on a message queue should grant
mq_send(), but write permissions on shared memory grant a lot more than
just that.
