Yes it simply works, as long as it works...

SG_IO is perfect as is, what problems are you referring to?

In 2.6, there is basically zero extra overhead with CDROM_SEND_PACKET,
since it's just a small wrapper on top of SG_IO (see scsi_ioctl.c if you
are curious), so you cannot measure a performance difference between the
two there.
In 2.4 it's orders of magnitude slower, since it will not use
CDROM_SEND_PACKET and it puts unnecessary strain on the memory allocator
to larger chunks of physically contigous memory. Note that you will not
see interrupt handler load if you are only doing casual performance
monitoring.
