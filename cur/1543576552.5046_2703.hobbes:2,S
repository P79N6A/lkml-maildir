Hmm, would have been nice, but it crashes here with 20001222, nevertheless. 
For which CPU do you have your kernel configured? It might be a CPU specific 
issue, I'll try to compile for Pentium I and 486, now, and report my results.
It would also be nice to know if this is a gcc issue or a kernel issue - if I 
knew which precise file was responsible for the crash, I could compare the 
assembly output for stable and snapshot GCC. My suspect is kernel/sched.c, 
but this might be wrong, as the story begins on the launch of kupdate in 
fs/buffer.c.
But now I have almost no clue what really goes wrong.
Geetings and a nice christmas to everybody!
Andreas
