    For a period of two or three months, V4L maintainer (Gerd Knorr)
quited as a maintainer, but V4L activities has not gone... lots of new
improvements was done since them, but not applied due to lack of a
maintainer.
    This patchset was a series of patches to synchronize both structures
(kernel AND v4l devel).
     We are aware of the regression caused by these patches (promptly
corrected), and will take efforts to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Mauro.
