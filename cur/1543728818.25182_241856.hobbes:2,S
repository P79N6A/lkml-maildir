This patch looks OK except that it includes the command WRITE BUFFER. It 
is used to flash the firmware for many devices. Even the SCSI standard 
(draft) specifies that mode 06h is "Download microcode and save". This 
command _should be removed_ from the list of allowed commands.

As far as I can read the code, the filtering applies to all devices. 
Except WRITE BUFFER, the commands are acceptable for tapes considering the 
opening mode or undefined for tapes. The undefined commands may cause a 
device with bad firmware to lock the SCSI bus and in this way to cause DoS. 
However, this applies also to commands defined for a type of device but 
not implemented because they are optional.
I am ready to accept this risk of DoS (provided that allowing the filtered 
commands is really useful for somebody) but this is a risk we must 
recognize.

I think always requiring CAP_RAWIO would be the approach of least 
surprise.
