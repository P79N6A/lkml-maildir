From Jargon File (4.3.0, 30 APR 2001) [jargon]:
  schroedinbug /shroh'din-buhg/ n. [MIT: from the Schroedinger's Cat
     thought-experiment in quantum physics] A design or implementation bug in
     a program that doesn't manifest until someone reading source or using
     the program in an unusual way notices that it never should have worked,
     at which point the program promptly stops working for everybody until
     fixed. Though (like {bit rot}) this sounds impossible, it happens; some
     programs have harbored latent schroedinbugs for years. Compare
     {heisenbug}, {Bohr bug}, {mandelbug}.
Hold on to your horses everyone? :)
