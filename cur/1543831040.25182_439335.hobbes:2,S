 and it does not suggest this (it goes Maintainer> Linus | Alan Cox), so I did not know.  Maybe this address could be added either to maintainers or the lkml page?
At the end of:

there's:
"Contributing
Contributions are welcome on this FAQ. These can be submitted,
preferably in diff -u format, (against this HTML document source) by
Email to Richard (see the Contributors section above).
Sometimes, we may feel your contribution is controversial and/or
incomplete and/or could be improved somehow. Also, the turnaround time
has a wide range, from hours to months, depending on how busy Richard
is. Please do not email him to chase changes as it slows him down.
Suggestions and patches are queued, and will be processed eventually.
Acknowledgements are usually sent when the change is made. Please be
patient, FAQ updates are rarely urgent. Note that small, "obviously
correct" patches are more likely to be processed faster, and often jump
the queue ahead of larger patches."
If you want to send a patch...
