Or that's just how you see it.
Yes, if you don't compile and test on both it can always break on the
other arch. But this at least lets a developer know that what they are
modifying requires a compile and test on both. The current way is more
of a surprise that it breaks another arch.  You're changing a file in
arch/i386/... and you later get yelled at for breaking x86_64 ??  That's
not negligence, that's blame for being ignorant of the interlocking
dependencies. Where-as if you change the file in arch/x86 or
include/asm-x86, you had better test both architectures.
With the proposed patch set, what can break i386 by modifying something
in arch/x86_64, or what can break x86_64 by modifying something in
arch/i386? (not counting the unfinished pci shared code).

I'm not so sure about that. It at least gets people aware of the issues.
If you expect x86_64 to start encompassing 32bit, then at least have all
the files under arch/x86_64 and point the i386 there.  Create something
like a x86_common directory under arch/x86_64 and have that contain all
the code that i386 can also share.  Something that makes it cleaner and
not the total hacks that we have today.

Look, I sympathize with you. I'm not about to throw these patches at you
and then walk away. I'll take responsibility for them (I've been warned
by others that this will happen).  If there's issues and hardships that
cause you pain, feel free to kick some of the work over to me, and I'll
help you out. I'll even accept it when you write to me saying "here!
this is broken, and I think your arch/x86 crap is the cause. Fix it or
else!".
But I don't share your view that this doesn't give better software. And
I think what I've done was real work. Hey, I'm fine with keeping this in
arch/x86_64, in something called arch/x86_64/x86_common or something. As
long as there's a distinct separation of what is shared and obvious that
more testing needs to be done if modified.
