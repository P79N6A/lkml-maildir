Subject: [PATCH -mm -v3 2/2] i386/x86_64 boot: document for 32 bit boot protocol
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/19/54

This patch defines a 32-bit boot protocol and adds corresponding
document. It is based on the proposal of Peter Anvin.
Known issues:
- The fields in zero page are fairly complex (such as struct
  edd_info). Is it necessary to document every field inside the first
  level fields, until the primary data type? Or is it sufficient to
  provide the C struct name only?
ChangeLog:
-- v3 --
- Move hd0_info and hd1_info back to zero page for compatibility.
-- v2 --
- Revise zero page description according to the source code and move
  them to zero-page.txt.

+**** SETUP DATA TYPES
+
+
+**** 32-bit BOOT PROTOCOL
+
+For machine with some new BIOS other than legacy BIOS, such as EFI,
+LinuxBIOS, etc, and kexec, the 16-bit real mode setup code in kernel
+based on legacy BIOS can not be used, so a 32-bit boot protocol need
+to be defined.
+
+In 32-bit boot protocol, the first step in loading a Linux kernel
+should still be to load the real-mode code and then examine the kernel
+header at offset 0x01f1. But, it is not necessary to load all
+real-mode code, just first 4K bytes traditionally known as "zero page"
+is needed.
+
+In addition to read/modify/write kernel header of the zero page as
+that of 16-bit boot protocol, the boot loader should also fill the
+additional fields of the zero page as that described in zero-page.txt.
+
+After loading and setuping the zero page, the boot loader can load the
+32/64-bit kernel in the same way as that of 16-bit boot protocol.
+
+In 32-bit boot protocol, the kernel is started by jumping to the
+32-bit kernel entry point, which is the start address of loaded
+32/64-bit kernel.
+
+At entry, the CPU must be in 32-bit protected mode with paging
+disabled; the CS and DS must be 4G flat segments; %esi holds the base
+address of the "zero page"; %esp, %ebp, %edi should be zero.

-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!
-The zero page is a kernel internal data structure, not a stable ABI.  It might change
-without warning and the kernel has no way to detect old version of it.
-If you're writing some external code like a boot loader you should only use
