Hello, 
I was looking through the ext2 source code, and I found EXE2_UNRM_FL which
(I think ) will make the file with this flag undeletable (or recoverable).
Is this thing ever implemented ? or if this flag works, where is the code
for it? Thanx in advance.
In case you were wondering, it is defined in dir
'linux/linclude/linux/ext2_fs.h'
ext2_fs.h:187:#define   EXT2_UNRM_FL                    0x00000002
but I couldn't fine that anywhere else..
