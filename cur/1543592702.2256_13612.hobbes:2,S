2.4.4-ac5 seams to use the swap about as much as 2.4.4, which is less than
2.4.5-ac2. In my simple "freesly boot kernel, start X and Mozilla" test
2.4.4-ac5 showed almost identical 'free' output as 2.4.4:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         62760      61368       1392          0       1828      28760
-/+ buffers/cache:      30780      31980
Swap:       160608          0     160608

Yes, I feel bad interactivety with later 2.4.4-acX kernels, and 2.4.5
kernels. Switching between apps and such feels a lot slower.
Let me know if you want me to do more tests.
