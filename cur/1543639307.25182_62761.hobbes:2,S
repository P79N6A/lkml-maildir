Subject: [patch 8/12] reduced buffer layer locking
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

lockmeter instrumentation shows that during a 60-second write to four
disks the kernel takes 12,000,000 spinlocks.  It wrote 1,000,000 pages.
The kernel is taking a spinlock once per 10,000 instructions.  That
seems to be quite a lot.  And it's not counting the 7,000,000 rwlocks. 
And lockmeter doesn't count the buslocked operations which arise from
semaphores or bitops.
3,000,000 of those spinlocks are pagemap_lru_lock.  The patches which
I'm working on against that lock reduce its count to 90,000.
Of the remaining 9,000,000 spinlockings, 3,000,000 are in
__find_get_block (getblk).
This patch removes the locking from __find_get_blocks(), so we're down
to 6,000,000.
The locking in __find_get_block() is only needed to protect against
invalidate_bh_lrus(), which is called at unmount and ioctl(BLKFLSBUF).
Remove the spinlocks and use a cross-CPU call to perform the
invalidate.  Protect against that with a local_irq_disable() in the
fastpath.
This assumes that local_irq_disable() is cheaper than a lock.
This code assumes that local_irq_save() provides protection from an
smp_call_function() handler.  This is OK in 2.5 but is not supported in
2.4.  Because sparc32 IPIs are not blocked by local_irq_disable() in
2.4.
On uniprocessor we don't need any of this locking - a preempt_disable()
in the invalidate path is sufficient.
The code assumes that find_get_block(), getblk() and bread() are never
called with interrupts disabled.  There is an x86 bugcheck for that. 
If it trips I'll need to fix the caller or replace local_irq_disable()
with local_irq_save().
The remaining piggy spinlocks are:
rmqueue(): 1,000,000
    One per page.  I'll be doing gang allocation for readahead, but
    for write(2) and anonymous pagefaults we'll need a per-cpu page
    buffer.  I have a patch for that but it's hacky.
__free_pages_ok(): 1,000,000
    gang-free is close, and will reduce this to 70,000-odd.
try_to_free_buffers(): 1,000,000
create_empty_buffers(): 1,000,000
    That's life with buffers.  A delayed-allocate ext2 would bring
    these to zero.
kmem_cache_reap: 270,000
    This one is interesting not because of the lock, but because of
    the semaphore.  The rwlock inside cache_chain_sem is 25% contended.
    What's happening is that each caller into page reclaim runs
    kmem_cache_reap: take the semaphore, futz around doing nothing for
    a while, then release the sempahore and go do page reclaim.
    This has the effect of serialising entry into the page reclaim
    and accidentally decreases contention on pagemap_lru_lock.
