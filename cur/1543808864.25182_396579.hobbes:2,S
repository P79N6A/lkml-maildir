Ok, I checked with 3.3.6 and 3.4.5 and adding const to ktime_divns/ 
posix_cpu_nsleep fixes the problem (actually the kernel becomes even 
smaller because posix_cpu_clock_getres is better off without const), both 
are complex and noncritical functions.
Andrew, I'd really prefer to keep the patch and I'll send a patch to add 
the const where it's actually an improvement.
bye, Roman
