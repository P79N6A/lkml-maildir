There were no isa devices on that machine. Just the eepro and the 
adaptec 2940 on board. There was a secondary eepro, which i removed
when i had troubles with the onboard card ( when i got the onboard
adapter working i added the secondary eepro100 PC which by the way worked
smoothly already).
By the way, i am using a redhat 6.1. I had to replace the rh kernel 2.2.12
with a vanilla 2.2.13 , the redhat kernel was hanging up when initializing
the eth1. ( and all this after i spent quite a while finding out why
lilo didnt work with rh 6.1, for those having problems rh6.1 forgets
the "linear" option on the lilo.conf. to work around either pick up the
new boot images from redhat or choose custom install, which allows you
to choose to specify "linear" option on the lilo configuration).
With the vanilla kernel the "kudzu" tool didnt work properly anymore,
so i had to remove it. are there special kernel extensions to get that
"hardware detection" tool to work ?
