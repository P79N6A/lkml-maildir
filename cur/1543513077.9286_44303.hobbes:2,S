What I mean is can esd send one set of sounds out to one user's terminal
and another set to another user's terminal? :)  I know it doesn't do NAS
yet, but that's what I meant.

So's NAS, I need NAS :)  Some people need rplay.  Some people just need
/dev/audio.

What I mean is that by providing an interface as opposed to a policy you
give people the option of using whatever mechanism they like--esd, NAS,
rplay, or their own thing--and they'll all work together, AND they can do
stuff like what I want to do if they want.  I am not suggesting forcing
people into one solution.  Perhaps an interface like this would be
beneficial though?

I don't particularly like svga programs and it's not critical to me that
they work.  I wouldn't go write this program even if the interface I'm
talking about _were_ in the kernel :)  But if I were I'd rather write a
program to do it that runs outside of svgalib.  That would save me the
trouble of recompiling all my svgalib programs and figuring out a way I
could still use them to do what they normally do.
