That sounds almost certainly like a VPN problem.  The tg3_timer() code
wakes up every second or tenth of a second (depending on which mode
you're in) and takes care of keeping the tg3 hardware mollified.  On a
standard kernel, this shouldn't ever be an issue.  For the -rt kernel,
this problem only shows up if you have enough tasks running at
rtprio's above the rtprio of the softirq-timer for long enough that
tg3 chip gets angry....
