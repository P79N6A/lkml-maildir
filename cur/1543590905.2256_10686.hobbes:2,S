First of all, I apologize for not having sent this notice out sooner. 
This kind of writing is very painful to deal with.
Linus Torvalds has requested a moratorium on new device number
assignments. His hope is that a new and better method for device space
handing will emerge as a result.
Alan Cox has requested that I maintain a forked registry for his -ac
kernel patch tree.  I have agreed to do so once I have forked off the
"final" version of the registry for Linus' tree.  At that time I will
process the backlog for the benefit of the -ac registry only.  Please
have patience until I can get that to happen.
Please note that this is not my decision (in fact, I have serious
concerns with it.)  In particular, /dev namespace coordination still
applies.
Sincerely,
	H. Peter Anvin
