Hello,
finally got around to upgrading my old cyrix 486-66 box to 2.4.0
[compiled it locally for the first time since the 2.1.1xx series.  It took
about 3.5 hours to compile the kernel.  make dep took 30 minutes.  make
menuconfig was almost so slow as to be unusable].
In any case, the CPU is incorrectly reported as a NexGen chip, of all
things.  It was reported correctly in 2.2.x
I do remember someone mentioning that the new cpuinfo code in 2.4.x might
be untested on older chips.  In any case attached is the 2.4 and 2.2
cpuinfo files.  If I get a chance I might try to sort this out myself.
Vince
