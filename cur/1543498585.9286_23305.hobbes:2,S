I confess ignorance about H323 as well as kernel internals to have
an opinion on user-space vs kernel-space. I remember
reading that while the computer telephony adpaters plug into PCI or
ISA slots, they are also connected by and additional cable. Considering
that a separate bus is involved, I am surprised that no kernel
support may be needed.

I presume we would at the least need device drivers for adapters.
