Subject: [PATCH] avoid compiler warnings
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/15/133

Pointers should not be casted to u32 as this results in compiler warnings
on 64-bit platforms.
