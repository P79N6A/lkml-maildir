The code as was submitted last year to this list did _NOT_ "sit around
and wait for everything to time out".
It is unfortunate (but clever tactic by bottomley) that the code was
NOT pulled from my git trees into scsi-misc and then "worked on", but
was instead "worked on" in private and then committed to scsi-misc.
So the code has no git history/revision history before it was "edited by"
by bottomley, as we'd seen with the SAS event processing.
BTW, I do have git trees of the code and an uninterruptible git
history of the code from the very beginning.
I.e. uninterruptible continued git history after initial
posting date of 09/09/2005, 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=112629423714248&w=2
The git trees were then hosted by 
http://linux.adaptec.com/sas/
