OK, if you are going to do it that way, then the ioc_batching code in get_request
has to be reworked.  We never push the queue so hard that it kicks itself into the
batching mode.  However, calls to get_io_context and put_io_context are unconditional
in that function.  Execution profile shows that these two little functions actually
consumed lots of cpu cycles.
AFAICS, ioc_*batching() is trying to push more requests onto the queue that is full
(or near full) and give high priority to the process that hits the last req slot.
Why do we need to go all the way to tsk->io_context to keep track of that state?
For a clean up bonus, I think the tracking can be moved into the queue structure.

Absolutely. I'm disappointed too and this is totally out of expectation.  There
must be some other factors.
