   readsl becomes relevant once people start shipping bridges that can do
   asynchronous pci mmio read or burst mode to order however
   
This would be relevant if the MMIO address were to increment,
but bursting from the same MMIO word?  That's what readsl
is meant to do, just as insl does for port I/O addresses.
UltraSPARC can do what you mention using 64-byte block loads and
stores, the same ones we use for fast memcpy/memset.  It just looks
like a huge 64-byte MMIO on the pci bus.
