Adrian,
At first glance, I already see many collisions with pending
patchsets...  Mauro is getting ready to push a whole bunch of patches
onto the v4l-dvb git tree.
Could you please wait until after those get merged?
Also, I'm not sure about some of the changes here... Hopefully some of
the other DVB guys will have some comments.  I think it's better to
postphone reviewing this until after we merge our new v4l / dvb stuff.
Regards,
Michael Krufky
