 Did a bit of that recently with 2.4, everything was ok except that
fixation, at least for audio CDs under xcdroast, took a _very_ long
time.  That box is now running 2.6.1 and using -dev=/dev/hdc : I tested
xcdroast on audio the other day - writing was ok, but it insisted on
reading from 0,0,0 and claimed there was nothing in /dev/hdc.  I've just
tested writing a data cd from /dev/hdc and it works fine for me.
 I got the impression that under 2.4 dev=ATAPI was not the best way to
go.  For 2.6 it seems happy to use the regular device name.  Burns at
16x, which is all the drive supports, reads fine on what I've tested.
Suggest you (Charles) try it as -dev=/dev/hdc (or wherever it is).

 Surely not!  The basic system on that box of mine was put together in
October 2002 (although X, the graphical stuff, and cdrecord were only
compiled two or three months back - 2.6.1 is my first try with 2.6 on
it).  I'm a good boy, I don't have /usr/src/linux:
