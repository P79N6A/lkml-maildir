No, I'd just fix them up.
They mostly don't _need_ the lock (at least not the binary loader ones),
since at executable loading time you're guaranteed to be the only user
anyway, but hey, we get the lock for do_mmap() there for the same reason:  
to just keep things consistent (and I think we used to have a warning in
do_mmap() a long time ago when we were chasing down some other bug, so
doign the same thing for do_brk() is just very consistent).
Another issue is likely that we should make the whole "uselib()"
interfaces configurable. I don't think modern binaries use it (where
"modern" probably means "compiled within the last 8 years" ;).
