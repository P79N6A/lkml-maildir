Doubtfully of course. I maintain a small OSS applicatione and although
it sucks, it wouldn't be there where it is now w/o input from others.
Some are better at writing code, others making patches and others
complaing why XYZ doesn't work. But all do contribute. 
Imho it would be very unpolite to them to just say, thanks for
everything but this app is dead and btw. I removed all references to it.
Please play be the rules, GPL is GPL period (and don't make this a weak
spot for OSS by being soft).

I'm sure this will resolve one day (in the meantime, I've put what I had
on my hd on 
http://www.xs4all.nl/~jjvrieze/pwc.html,
 please alert if the
md5sum are incorrect for those having this somewhere too).
