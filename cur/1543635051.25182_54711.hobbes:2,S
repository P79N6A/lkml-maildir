*shrug* FreeBSD should have eaten some of those drives as well, it has
been offering hw.ata.tags="1" to enable DMA QUEUED for a while now.
And yes, my deathstar DTLA307045 still works without a single broken
block, but never used TCQ beyond booting 2.5.17 once (no LVM -> not
useful for me).
Another DTLA307045 died some days ago, it has never seen TCQ.
