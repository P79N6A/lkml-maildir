Ah sorry. I misread the intention of your code. I thought you wanted
to do it the other way round - 32bit syscall from 64bit code.
I just wanted to point out that you can do it directly without
changing the code segment, as long as you use int $0x80.
From 64bit-from-32bit the lcall is needed agreed. However as a 
warning it will not work for all calls since a few check a bit
in task_struct that says if the process is 32bit or 64bit
(rather rare though, most prominent is signal handling)

I haven't ever tried it, but I see no reason it cannot work.
