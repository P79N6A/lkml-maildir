I wondering about the status of encrypted loopback support in the 2.5
kernel series. I know crypto-api was merged in, but I haven't been able
to find any pointers about encrypting loopback devices, and I haven't
seen any pointers to this after searching.
It would also be nice to be able to apply encryption to a partition
directly, without a loopback, although I can see that this might require
a new set of ioctls and might introduce some incompatibilities.
Thanks,
