The driver is waiting in the -mm tree (-mm2 right now) for being
included in the mainline kernel sometime in the future. If it is
included, I will maintain it as I coded it as it apears in the
MAINTAINERS file. Why are you so worried about it if I can ask? Do you
want some more features or something like that?
I missed the other two questions you wrote few days ago. About the
second one, that was discussed a lot in the past and the people
decided that (it wasn't my idea). About the first one, well, my ks0108
code is the one for the wiring of an auxiliary LCD, so if you read the
discussion you will find the people wanted to split video things and
other auxiliary displays, so I think it is better to split it.
(Anyway, I'm answering quickly, I haven't checked the code you talk
about, but I will anyway).
Thanks,
