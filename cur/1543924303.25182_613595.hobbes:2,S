True (just verified again). But then I didn't actually say that this line
is problematic. Since I had to replace the leading . replacement part already
I decided to simply fold everything into one sed expression.

"Debian stable.", aka "Update not an option.". Right?
Since the specs list both possibilities I'd simply go with the safe one,
the one that works on older dash versions, too.
Unless adding a $ sign happens to break other equally important
shells...

This is where I'd think the problem is. If dash once upon a time
decided to support the $ variant only and the specs didn't list both
at that time, well...
The dash version on my system is 0.5.3-5, BTW. Even Debian testing
has 0.5.3-7 only.
I'm now quite certain on which side to tweak things ;)
Thanks a lot for your review,
