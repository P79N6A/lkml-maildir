I seams to work for M$, not that they are a good example.
But in /proc/sys/vm or /proc/sys/swapfile having
min_swap, max_swap, min_free_space and the filename to use. This could
then be set by init scripts like sysctl.
It never grows larger than max(swapfile.max_swap, free_space -
min_free_space).
so if you have free space on the filesystem it can be used,
but if you don't have space the current behavior remains.
Sure it would be slow, but that would only be a problem if you
run out of swap space and need to allocate more. Any
time this routine allocates a larger file than syapfile.min_swap
or frees space you send a WARN message.
Now the user will know why the performance dropped
and can either add RAM, or increase swap with by
partition, file, or increase swapfile.min_swap.
Those with enough RAM/swap will never even know it's there.
