Ouch ouch ouch. It should better be
typedef uint32_t __u32;
So that even if there happens to be a compiler that does sizeof(int)=8,
sizeof(u32) will actually be 4. Say, if there happens to be an
architecture that does only know 64-bit integers, the compiler will
have some extra magic to make uint32_t behave like a 32-bit type in C
and transparently use 64-bit assembler. So far the theory.
