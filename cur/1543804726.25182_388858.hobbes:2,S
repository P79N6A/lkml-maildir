Subject: isapnp causes "REALTIME operation timeout exceeded" with 2.6.12 and newer

Hello,
beginning with 2.6.12 (everything older is OK), this started to appear 
during boot (and it's still present in 2.6.15.1):
REALTIME operation timeout exceeded - Switching to normal scheduling
nanosleep failed: Interrupted system call
I tracked it down to "/sbin/isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf"
/sbin/isapnp is from isapnptools-1.26-i386-1.tgz (Slackware-current).
I use /sbin/isapnp to configure my network (3C509) and sound card 
(CMI8329A used as SB16 with sb16 module). It probably causes no problems 
(as both cards work fine) but the error message (and the delay too) is 
annoying.
Does anyone know what can cause this?
