Ok, Thanks!

Yes, you are right.

Good point. This text was directly taken from the man page of
posix_fallocate and is also there on the posix specifications at:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/posix_fallocate.html
The current posix_fallocate() implementation and also the fallocate()
implementation in ext4 are based on above documentation, wherein EOF is
compared with "offset + len" and not with "offset + len - 1".
I am not sure if this is right or wrong. But, this is as per posix
specifications. ;)

Please see my previous comment.

There is a typo above. We have "file system" repeated twice in above
sentence. Second one should be "file".
