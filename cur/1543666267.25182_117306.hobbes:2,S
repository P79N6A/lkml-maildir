Sounds similar to the problem of recognizing valid plaintext when 
breaking a code.
As a practical matter (and in the context of this being a heuristic 
debugging aid, not a guaranteed 100%-correct method), I wonder 
whether one might not tend to sync up fairly quickly to the correct 
code. For example, strings of one-byte instructions provide a 
"landing zone" for disassembly leading up to them, and illegal 
instructions provide clues that you're out of sync (not perfect, but 
perhaps good enough).
I'm not in a position to do it right now, but I'd suggest trying it: 
disassemble hunks of random code on random boundaries, and see how 
many ways there tend to be of arriving at EIP+0, given enough of a 
BEIP running start (for some definition of "enough").
