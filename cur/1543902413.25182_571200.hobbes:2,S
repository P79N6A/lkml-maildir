uhm, [and the uninterested reader might want to skip to the next mail 
;-)], i'm really confused about your reply. Do you really mean this:

the ";-)" emoticon (and its contents) clearly signals this as a 
sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek remark. To make it even clearer, please 
re-read it with the <sarcastic> tag added as well for clarity:

ok? (If you didnt see/read it as sarcastic straight away then my 
apologies for insulting you!)
The "_might_ be able to answer" bit is of course sarcastic too, and 
contrary to your (i have to say, pretty absurd) suggestion i did not 
suggest that i "might be _willing_ to answer" - which would be quite 
arrogant indeed and which i never said or suggested. To make it even 
clearer: i'm definitely able to answer questions about code i wrote 
originally and which i just changed, were you to show genuine interest 
in hearing my opinion :-)
