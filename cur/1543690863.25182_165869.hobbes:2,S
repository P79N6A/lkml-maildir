Subject: 2.6.0test-1 error while writing files to loopback UDF filesystem UDF-fs DEBUG fs/udf/balloc.c:192:udf_

Hi,
I created an UDF filesystem (dd of=file if=... && mkudffs file && mount -o 
loop -t udf /mnt) and then added some files to it (tar cf - * | (cd /mnt ; 
tar xvpf -)).
That went well for a while, but after aprox 2GB (beware: no file was longer 
then +/- 1GB), I got these errors in syslog:
Sep 14 00:04:38 boemboem kernel: UDF-fs DEBUG fs/udf/balloc.c:192:udf_
bitmap_free_blocks: bit 3125 already set
Sep 14 00:04:38 boemboem kernel: UDF-fs DEBUG fs/udf/balloc.c:193:udf_
bitmap_free_blocks: byte=20
Sep 14 00:04:38 boemboem kernel: UDF-fs DEBUG fs/udf/balloc.c:192:udf_
bitmap_free_blocks: bit 3125 already set
Sep 14 00:04:38 boemboem kernel: UDF-fs DEBUG fs/udf/balloc.c:193:udf_
bitmap_free_blocks: byte=60
etc.
I then did a compare (cmp -l) and found that the copied file was different 
from the original one, so it seems something is going wrong while writing to 
the UDF filesystem.
As I wrote in the subjectline, I'm using 2.6.0-test1.
