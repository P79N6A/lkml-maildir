Hello!
   I just run memory intensive process (actually vmware thast eats
   1/2 of memory at that box). All almost fine (unfsd was killed and
   complained about 'Oh no Mr. Bill... nfs_server() returned!').
   But after I exited that process, I got this 'free' output
   (look at buffers value):
angband:~# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         30672      29920        752      13744    4191956      22828

This is UP 2.3.9-pre8 compiled with GCC 2.7.2.3
