Hello, I have a gaming rig and would love to help benchmark with my copy
of UT2004(E6600 Core2 and a 7950GTO card). Or if you have anything else
that would better serve as a benchmark I could grab it and try.
The only problem is I don't know what 2 kernels I should be using to
test the schedulers. I assume 2.6.23-rc1 for CFS, but what about SD?
