00:12.0 Ethernet controller: VIA Technologies, Inc.: Unknown
device 3065 (rev 42)
        Subsystem: D-Link System Inc: Unknown device 1400

And I do not have drivers for the dlink card in win98.  The 2
cards are in my workstation, one goes to my firewall @ 10Mbit and
the other to my build/devel machine at 100mbit which 98 doesn't
get to see.  It is sure interested in the card at boot time
though... EVERY time... ;o(
