It doesn't really matter that the hash collision is /less/ likely to ruin data
than something in hardware as it adds an /extra/ layer of possible corruption,
so you have a net gain in the possible corruption of your data.  Now, if you
could write it so that there was /no/ possibility of data corruption, than it
would be much more acceptable as it wouldn't add any extra likeliness of
corruption than already exists.
