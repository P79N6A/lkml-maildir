The socket lock (sock_readers) ensures this. From user context
the kernel lock guarantees single entry as long as you don't sleep,
when you sleep (e.g. in a user space access) the TCP code is careful
enough to recheck everything. As long as sock_readers is > 0 the 
network bh context rcv_* functions will not be executed for new
arriving packets, they are queued in the backlog instead and processed
in the release_sock.
In 2.3 lock_sock also does the synchronization for user context that
the big kernel lock does in 2.2.
Hope this help,
