Subject: SMP filesystem corruption in 2.3.40 (and before) with sawmill "make install"

Hello,
As per our conversion on IRC, here are all of the details.
Installing the sawmill window manager manually on my machine seems to
sometimes cause one or more of the files in the sawmill themes directory
to be corrupted.  It appears to usually be one or more .png files in the
/usr/local/share/sawmill/0.22/themes/microGUI directory, and it's quite
easy to see because the window manager will not start (or bomb out if
restarted while in X) when a png file is corrupted.
I'm running on a dual processor box with 128 MB ECC SDRAM, and I've
noticed this back in the days when sawmill 0.15 was current (when I first
started using it).  The problem seemed to have gone away (or happened
less often, I suppose) in the last few weeks, but now it just happened
twice in a row again, when I reinstalled sawmill from within X.
In the last installation run that broke, two images appear to have been
corrupted.  I copied the directory to "microGUI.broken" and installed
again, and did a diff:
[sroot@oof:/usr/local/share/sawmill/0.22/themes]# diff -urN microGUI*
Binary files microGUI/close_normal.png and microGUI.broken/close_normal.png differ
Binary files microGUI/minimize_clicked.png and microGUI.broken/minimize_clicked.png differ
[sroot@oof:/usr/local/share/sawmill/0.22/themes]# strings microGUI.broken/close_normal.png

Interesting...it got overwritten with the directory that it's in!  Almost
exactly the same as the directory listing.
Sometimes this seems to happen in cache, and sometimes it seems to happen
on disk and work fine in cache.  You may want to try "make install" while
samwill is running and again without it running if you can't seem to
reproduce it.  I know I can reproduce it quit easily here, and the fact
that it corrupted two files this time seems to show that it isn't a very
hard to reproduce problem (with sawmill's "make install", at least :) ).
The filesystem it's installed on is just a standard ext2 1K block
filesystem, and I haven't really seen anything else making any corruption
on it before.
