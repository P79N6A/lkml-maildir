I'm not sure to understand your point.
The first sentence tell me that the "struct pt_regs ..." line is x86
specific and this was the reason behind my proposition to not add a _signal
macro but a  _sys_nanosleep macro to include this too.
The second sentence seem's to indicate that this is a classic problem for
the ARM port. So if this is correct what is the best way to solve it ?
