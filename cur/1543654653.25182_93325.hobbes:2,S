32Gb was indeed what we've been working towards for 2.6, and we've 
been running that on some workloads.
However, if you're willing to run with a 2:2 or even a 1:3 user:kernel
split instead of the default 3:1, you can get away with all sorts of
things, probably including 64Gb. I've got the hardware to build such
a beast, but haven't bothered yet (we have enough problems already ;-)).
Big databases won't like it, but other workloads without huge individual
processes (or shared mappings) will be fine.
