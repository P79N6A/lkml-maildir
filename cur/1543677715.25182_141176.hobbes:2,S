This seems a bit heavyweight; although some VFS support is needed for
a complex filesystem, effectively doing it all in the kernel (#3)
seems a bit... excessive.
At least #2 can be done with existing means using follow_link.
I think using a revalidation pointer like dentries might be a better
way to do #4/#5, although using the existing one in the dentries is
probably better.
#1 isn't really clear to me what you're going for, but it seems to be
to duplicate bookkeeping.
I also don't see how this solves the biggest problems with complex
automounts, which are:
a) how to guarantee that a large mount tree can be safely destroyed;
b) how to detect partial unmounts.
