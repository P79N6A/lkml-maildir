Please avoid using longs here.  "res" really is a virtual address, and
it would be polite to keep it in a pointer of some kind.  Returning
void* would also avoid the two casts in alloc_pagedir().  The same
probably goes for pbe->address and pbe->orig_address.
BTW, I think get_zeroed_page() returns a long to keep people from
confusing it with the allocator routines that return actual 'struct page
*', and not the page's virtual address.  So, you really should be
casting them to real pointers as soon as it comes back from
get_zeroed_page() and cousins.
