I think those people who has two boxes and an eth link can test 2.5 on NFS 
root mode since 2.5 does not contain big changes to NFS code and it's harder 
to corrupt filesystems over NFS ;-). Problems? Just use that Big Red Switch!
(don't forget to write down oops first though ;-)
I personally would do that too, once it would compile for me.
BTW, where's netconsole patches for 2.5, just in case?
