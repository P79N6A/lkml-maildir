Let's clarify that we are talking about userspace->kernelspace
direction.
Only for that messages callback path is invoked.
For such messages there is always scheduling after system call.
So if we have situation when after a schedule() call work queue can not
be scheduled, but userspace process in that situation can not be
scheduled
too, so no new message will be delivered and nothing can be dropped.
Actually you pointed to the interesting peice of code, 
I've digged out some old pre-connector draft, where there is a note, 
that it could be fine to
1. send messages to self, but first implementation was dropped.
2. call several callbacks in parallel, although it can not happen now.
So I will think of changing that code, although it works without unneded
drops now.
