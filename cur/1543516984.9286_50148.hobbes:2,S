You agree with what? If I don't understand what David suggested, I don't
understand what you agree with.
If David suggested to write -1's to userspace's fd[2] that means overhead
in non-failing case which is totally unacceptable. (it's the same as doing
verify_area(), in fact it is cheaper to keep the kernel lock over
copy_to_user() and close the descriptors if failed than doing that).
If David suggested to write -1's to local kernel fd[2] then I don't see
how it makes any difference.
Regards,
Tigran.
