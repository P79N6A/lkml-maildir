Well, I have tried with 2.4.5-pre1 compiled form SMP, and the result has been that this morning when I wake up the system has the console black (is there any way to prevent cons.saver from blanking the screen) and the disks where quiet, so I SysRQ-Sync, Umount, powerOff and then, at the last command the console wake up and I have been saluted with:
Kernel BUG in sched.c:709!
Invalid operand: 0000
Dump copied by hand, but not yet filtered by ksymoops (I'm at work now).
kernel panic Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt not syncing.
This afternoon when I return home I will feed the stack dump to ksymoops and post the results, I mail this now just to see if someone sees the ligth.
