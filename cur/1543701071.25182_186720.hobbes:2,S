Ok, so the ataraid framework will not be ported at all tp 2.6.x, it will be
replaced with a device mapper?
Where could one read more about the device mapper?
I'm currently running RAID1 using ataraid on a Promise TX2000 card using the
2.4.23 kernel (patched with Walt H's pdcraid patch set to the list
yesterday).

the plan is to have a userspace device mapper app take it's place.
As for the timeframe; I'm looking at it but the userspace device mapper code
is still a bit of a mystory to me right now.
