Nope, not a trick question. The nagle heuristic means that small sends
will not wait indefinitely since sending the first small bit of data
starts the retransmission timer as a course of normal processing. So, I
am not in the habit of thinking about a "clear the buffer" timer being
set when a small send takes place but no transmit happens.
