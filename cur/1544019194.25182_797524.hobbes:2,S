We do know that it is happening on one system while creating
a symlink for a memory section so it should also happen on
the same system if unregister_mem_sect_under_nodes() were
called to remove the same symlink.
The test was actually added in response to a problem with an
earlier version reported by Yasunori Goto where one or more
of the leading pages of a memory section on the 2nd node of
one of his systems was uninitialized because I believe they
coincided with a memory hole.  The earlier version did not
ignore uninitialized pages and determined the nid by considering
only the 1st page of each memory section.  This caused the
symlink to the 1st memory section on the 2nd node to be 
incorrectly created in /sys/devices/system/node/node0 instead
of /sys/devices/system/node/node1.  The problem was fixed by
adding the test to skip over uninitialized pages.
I suspect we have not seen any reports of the non-removal
of a symlink due to the incorrect declaration of the nid
variable in unregister_mem_sect_under_nodes() because
  - systems where a memory section could have an uninitialized
    range of leading pages are probably rare.
  - memory remove is probably not done very frequently on the
    systems that are capable of demonstrating the problem.
  - lingering symlink(s) that should have been removed may
    have simply gone unnoticed.

It actually silently skips pages (not nodes) in it's quest
for valid nids for all the nodes that the memory section scans.
This is definitely desirable.
I hope this answers your questions.
Thanks,
