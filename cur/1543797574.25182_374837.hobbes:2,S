Looks mostly okay to me, small comments below.

len and p are unused.

Why the limit? We may want to allow very big images when someone wants
"as similar to suspended system as possible".

In fact this is not maximum. If more than 500MB can't be freed, well,
it will not be freed. Very improbable, but possible.

With runtime configuration, we should not need additional
compile-time config. OTOH /proc tunables should have descritption in
Documentation/.
