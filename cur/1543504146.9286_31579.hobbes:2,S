Hi,
Sorry to follow so quickly from the last version but there was a stupid
one-liner fault which managed to sneak into the 2.2 patch I sent out
yesterday.  Get
    
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs/raw-io/raw-19990728.tar.gz
Change summary:
    Raw device support v0.6, 28 July 1999
    Changed since v0.5:	    Removed 2.3 support: it's now in the mainstream
			    kernel as of 2.3.12-pre7.
			    Added diffs for both plain 2.2.5 and RedHat-6.0
			    2.2.5.
			    Fixed a one-liner compile problem which affected
			    the 2.2 patch as distributed.
