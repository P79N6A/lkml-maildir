I haven't looked at this new code all that closely as yet.  One thing I 
did notice is that there is an assumption that the "timer being 
delivered flag" can be shared between LR timers and HR timers.  I 
suspect this is wrong as the delivery code is in seperate threads (I 
assume).  This could lead to del_timer_async missing a timer.
In the prior patch we just ignored the del_timer_async issue for HR 
timers (code I plan to do soon).  This WAS taken care of in earlier 
kernels by a reuse of one of the list link fields, but Andrew convince 
me that this was _not_ good.
So, my guess, a nanosleep for an RT task (I think you said these are 
promoted to HR) is completing and over writing the deliver in progress 
flag for a LR timer which just happens to have a del_timer_sync going on 
at the same time.
