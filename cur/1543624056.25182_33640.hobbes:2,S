The client code in 2.2.20 is supposed to be the same as in 2.4.x. The
only thing I can think might be missing is the fix to cope with broken
servers that reuse filehandles (this violates the RFCs). Reiserfs 3.5
+ knfsd is one such broken combination. Another broken server is
unfsd...

You might try keeping a file open on /backup while you play with /mnt...
