Hi guys,
I have made a new version of BCP on:
  
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/bcp/bcp-2.3.40-p4.patch
The changes are serious but do not add any new functionality - only
bugfixes and a couple of optimizations.
Those who don't know what BCP is - it is an enhancement of Linux boot code
to allow (at present) setting command line parameters without help of LILO
or other bootloaders. You can still use LILO, of course, and just override
whatever LILO has set (or examine the setting at boot).
All comments are welcome, as usual.
Tigran.
PS. Many thanks go to Kevin Lawton for writing Bochs - I spent 99% of the
time inside the simulator and only at the end tested it on real hardware.
(Also, BFE

 is great for this sort of thing)
