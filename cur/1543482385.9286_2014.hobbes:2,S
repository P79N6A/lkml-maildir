Yes, I've noticed some prompting that 2.2.0pre9 thought I
had a ES1888 but I KNOW I have the older 1688.  When I
recompiled
2.2.0pre9 with sound and 100% SB as MODULES, the ran sndconfig
later, I got 'some' sound playing with all the various DMA,
IRQ, etc options both with all ESSxxxx sndconfig options and
sound blaster.  Same thing, bad, choppy sound & longer sound
files, esp. *.wav's would not complete and I get:
Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?
But I reboot right back to 2.0.36 and all is perfect!
Can't wait to see wherein the problem lies: kernel, module(s)
or SHOULD there (or whereis) be a DSP_BUFFSIZE= as in 2.0.36?
Kinda seems like in  2.2.0pre9 sound bites are _not_ being
buffered properly?
Hope this was at least .0000001% useful???
