Looks like knfsd does not work at all.  In pre7, it worked for me
for a few days, and then stopped responding.  In -final, it does
not respond at all.  knfsd package is 981228 (or somesuch - the
latest one), no patches to the kernel applied.  Machine is UP P200.
Clients are Sparcs running varios versions of Solars and Linux 2.0.36.
On the server, I get "authenticated mount request from ..." and then
silence.  On the client, there are messages like "nfs server on ...
not responding".  knfsd processes are present, they are in "SD" state.
