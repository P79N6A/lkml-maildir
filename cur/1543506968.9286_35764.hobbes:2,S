>What does PARPORT_DEV_COMA mean?
Nothing, it is a historical relic.  The flag you are thinking of is actually 
PARPORT_FLAG_COMA in any case and it was never intended to be used for 
devices.  (It actually signalled that a port had given up its hardware 
resources to let legacy devices have a go.)
