I think this is the XFS problem with freezable workqueues.
Maxim, please try to apply the appended patch and see if it helps.
Greetings,

Since freezable workqueues are broken in 2.6.21-rc
(cf. http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=116855740612755,
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=117261312523921&w=2)
it's better to remove them altogether for 2.6.21 and change the only user of
them (XFS) accordingly.
