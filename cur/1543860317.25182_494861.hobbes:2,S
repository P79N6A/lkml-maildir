Hm in that case, what about having something like
void *memset_int(void *a, int x, int n) {
    asm("mov %0, %%esi;
         mov %1, %%eax;
         mov %2, %%ecx;
         repz movsd;",
       a,x,n);
}
in include/asm-i386/ and asm-x86_64/? (For x86_64, also a memset_long 
that uses rsi/rax/rcx/movsq)
