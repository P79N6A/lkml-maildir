Nobody can show an example of an application that would be broken because 
of this and, given the scenario and sequence of events that it requires to 
be broken when implementing the default as Choice B, I don't think it's as 
much of an issue as you believe.

So all applications that use the libnuma interface and numactl will have 
different default behavior than those that simply issue 
{get,set}_mempolicy() calls.  libnuma is a collection of higher level 
functions that should be built upon {get,set}_mempolicy() like they 
currently are and not introduce new subtleties like changing the semantics 
of a preferred node argument.  This is going to quickly become a 
documentation nightmare and, in my opinion, isn't worth the time or effort 
to support because we haven't even idenitifed any real-world examples.
Maybe Andi Kleen should weigh in on this topic because, if we go with what 
you're suggesting, we'll never get rid of the two differing behaviors and 
we'll be introducing different semantics to arguments of libnuma functions 
than the kernel API they are built upon.

True, but the ordering of that scenario is troublesome.  The correct way 
to implement it is to use set_mempolicy() or a higher level libnuma 
function with the same semantics and _then_ attach the task to a cpuset.  
Then the nodes_remap() takes care of the rest.
The scenario you describe above has a problem because it requires the task 
to have knowledge of the cpuset's mems in which it is attached when, for 
portability, it should have been written so that it is robust to any range 
of nodes you happen to assign it to.

No, because nodes_remap() takes care of the instances you describe above 
when the task sets its memory policy (usually done when it is started) and 
is then attached to a cpuset.

Supporting two different behaviors is going to be more problematic than 
simply selecting one and going with it and its associated documentation in 
future versions of the kernel.

Paul, the changes required to an application that is currently using 
{get,set}_mempolicy() calls to setup the memory policy or the higher level 
functions through libnuma is so easy to use Choice B as a default instead 
of Choice A that it would be ridiculous to support configuring it on a 
per-system or per-cpuset basis.

Choosing only one behavior for the kernel (Choice B) is by far the 
superior selection because then any task can share a cpuset with any other 
task and implement its memory policy preferences in terms of low level 
system calls, numactl, or libnuma.  That's the power that we should be 
giving users, not the addition of hacks or more configuration knobs that 
is going to clutter and confuse anybody who wants to simply pick a 
preferred node.

Yet the 'mems' file would still be system-wide; otherwise it would be 
impossible to expand the memory your cpuset has access to.  Everything 
else would be relative to 'mems'.
