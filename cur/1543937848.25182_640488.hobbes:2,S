Just curious...
My biggest latency problems (as observed by me, the user) happen when a
program needs memory, or launching a new program, and the kernel begins
forces dirty memory to disk.  This results in an unholy seek storm of
mixed writes (flushing, maybe a little swap) and reads (new program
loading).  Streaming audio/video almost always starts freezing up during
this as well.
I don't suppose LatencyTop would help track anything down in that case,
would it?
