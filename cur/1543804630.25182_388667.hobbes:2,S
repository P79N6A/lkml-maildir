Yup, none of us has time to single-handedly manage such a large 
security/bugkeeping effort.  I just want to see it done in the community 
since I'm a user, and developer using, three different distro's for now and 
the forseeable future, and potentially a fourth.  Not with 100% overlap 
but...certain distros lend themselves better to certain things.
