It's the saa7134 chip raising the IRQ with "parity error" bit set in the
IRQ status register.  Permanent error, acking the bit to the chip
doesn't make it go away, so the driver disables this IRQ condition to
make the card quiet.
Not sure why this happens, it really shouldn't see parity errors on the
PCI bus.  I've never seen that myself on my machines, probably it is
hardware related.
