But that doesn't come free of cost, does it, seeing we've now pushed
the conditional inside kfree() itself. kfree() isn't inlined so we do
save on space but lose out on the extra time overhead for the common
case. Speaking of which ...
[PATCH] {slub, slob}: use unlikely() for kfree(ZERO_OR_NULL_PTR) check
Considering kfree(NULL) would normally occur only in error paths and
kfree(ZERO_SIZE_PTR) is uncommon as well, so let's use unlikely() for
the condition check in SLUB's and SLOB's kfree() to optimize for the
common case. SLAB has this already.
