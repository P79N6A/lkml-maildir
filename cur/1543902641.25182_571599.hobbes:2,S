Incremental is preferred, but I convert replacement patches into
incremental patches at about 10Hz nowadays.  Whatever's easier.
(Actually, if it's a replacement patch then only I get to see the
incremental patch, and the incremental patch is more reviewer-friendly).

I don't _think_ there's any global exclusion on ->probe calls.  For a
particular driver instance it's hard to see how these thigns can run
concurrently, dunno.  I guess two hotunplugs coud happen concurrently.
