This *supposes* to be for VDMA, but since its introduction in kernel 2.5.35
(released on 15-Sep-2002!) it does *nothing*.

From the previous mail:
[PATCH] remove __ide_dma_count() and ide_hwif_t->ide_dma_count
Incremental to "[PATCH] remove ide_dma_{good,bad}_drive from ide_hwif_t".
->ide_dma_count() was introduced in kernel 2.5.35 and was meant to add support
for host FIFO counters (for VDMA), but is only a wrapper for ->ide_dma_begin()
(even for siimage.c b/c SIIMAGE_VIRTUAL_DMAPIO is undefined).
Moreover it should be possible to add VDMA code directly to ->ide_dma_begin().
