That would do for x86 without MMIO.

This can work. The compiler CALLS the assembly code.
Nothing new here: see all the libgcc functions if you aren't
used to the idea of the compiler calling functions behind
your back.
So we have assembly functions somewhat like this:
__volatile_read(void*dst, void*src, size_t size);
__volatile_write(void*dst, void*src, size_t size);
They probably have to look up the memory address to
determine if it belongs to a PCI device or not, etc.
For userspace code, they could even be system calls.
Without that, gcc just isn't correct on normal hardware.
I'm not suggesting this is fast, of course. Probably the
right answer is something like this:
-fvolatile=smp   # Add locks
-fvolatile=call   # Call custom functions
