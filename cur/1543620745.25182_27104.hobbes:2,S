The highlights are:
- NFSv4 allows *nix and windows clients to play well with each other
  (NFSv4/CIFS clients can interact appropriately).
- Strong security (authentication/integrity/privacy) is required of
  implementations.
- A single protocol instead of a collection of protocols (e.g. file
  locking, ACL support are in the protocol)
- Delegation (similar to CIFS oplock support) allows for more
  aggressive caching at the client
The University of Michigan/CITI work is the first to "release" but the
other implementations are not far behind.  We will be meeting at
Connectathon in a couple of weeks to do interoperability testing.
Should be a good event.
