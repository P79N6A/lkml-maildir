I would say that a few venerable programs, that have seen wide use
on old broken versions of unix, contain workarounds for this
problem.  I'm sure that most applications don't contain such
workarounds.  And it is expensive, so I would certainly prefer that
my find and ls didn't do this.

Wouldn't bind mounts solve your problem?  Why are you still
interested in hard links?
