Hi,
I am new to this list... so I am not sure if this question fits in the
topic of the discussion list.
I developing a Real-Time network protocol to work under Linux
ipv4. In the first phase of the project I took only the hardware
addresses to make the connections between PC's for not to worry about
the TCP and IP stuff and socket implementation, just for testing
purposes. My idea is to come up with a user level real-time socket
implementation and now I am in the process of reading the TCP/IP code to
find where the hostnames turn into TCP and IP addresses and finally where
these turn into hardware addresses. I would like my protocol to work in
an environment in which TCP/IP is operating.
I have found arp_find() and other functions that seems to look at the
route table and obtain the hardware addresses, but they are so inmersed
into the design of the TCP/IP that I have not clear idea how to use them.
Any help and/or reply would be really appreciated.
Thank you very much for your time.
