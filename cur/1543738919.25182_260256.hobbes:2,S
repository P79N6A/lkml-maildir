Subject: Submitting patches for unmaintained areas (Solaris x86 UFS bug)

I've run into a bug in the UFS reading code (on Solaris x86 the
major/minor numbers are in 2nd indirect offset not the first), so I've
patched it & bugzilled it
(
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3475
).
But where do I go from here? There doesn't seem to be a maintainer for
UFS so I can't send it there.
