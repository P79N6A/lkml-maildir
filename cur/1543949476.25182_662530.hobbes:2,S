There is also a bit of confusion about what any specific time should
_mean_.  Once upon a time NAND flash had ECC, could be written only once
(i.e. not write single bits by cleverly masking and rewriting), had a
well-known amount of OOB for general use, etc. while NOR could be
written bit-by-bit, rewritten, did not have ECC, had a higher quality
and all that.
These days you can buy NOR flashes that have all attributes of NAND
except OOB, NAND flashes may use all OOB area for error correction, etc.
etc.  In short, there is just about nothing left you can use the type
for.  And when it is used in JFFS2, you will find lots of code like "if
it is this type, but not that exception, then...".
