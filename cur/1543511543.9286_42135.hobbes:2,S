I merged Dave's fix (s/write_lock/write_lock_irq/) on my ntp patch. It was
a typo of course (hopefully it was why my original patch didn't worked
completly ;). Many thanks for fixing it.
The new patch is here:
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/my-2.3.18ac10/ntp-SMP-races-2
It can be applyed to the ac10 tree (it's exactly like in 2.2.13pre14).
