I'm entering the option 'hda=noprobe' (as one example) right after my boot
label in LILO.  The dmesg output I attached last time was a boot of straight
2.6.25-rc2 without any options; I've attached 'dmesg.noprobe.out' which is
the result of a boot with 'hda=noprobe'.
I must have done something stupid, but I can't see what; if you look at this
line from the dmesg output:
Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=linux_2.6.25rc2 ro root=900
md=0,/dev/sda5,/dev/sdb5 hda=noprobe
... it would suggest the option 'hda=noprobe' was entered correctly?

Heh.  This is my first new machine in 8 years, and I couldn't wait to start
using multiple cores.  I was quick to discover the '-j' option ... but I only
do '-j 4'.  Anyway ... I'd downloaded the full baseline linux-2.6.24.tar.bz2,
unpacked it, and then ran the patch patch-2.6.25-rc2.bz2 against it.  That
patch ran perfectly.  And I was in the right directory when I ran Bart's patch,
as I listed in my earlier e-mail!  All indications were that I was running the
2.6.25-rc2 kernel as required, I thought.
Well, I see that rc3 is out; maybe I'll give that a shot.
