Err.. Ok. I have the latest version of SD (that I know about). I could upgrade CFS, but unlike those 
doing real scientific testing, I'm just getting a feel with my usual usage patterns (thunderbird, 
firefox, openoffice, gimp, x-chat and gnome). I don't have any hard fast metrics I can measure 
against really.
Anything I post would be subjective at best. (And to be honest, once I get a stable and usable 
kernel I tend to stick with it for a month or so as I don't reboot - suspend2 regularly goes 100 
suspend/resume cycles to S3 between reboots for me)
I'm a little more willing to experiment on my desktop box, but I really live from the laptop.
Brad
