Could you tell me what's wrong in having an app with a 1.5G mapped executable
(or a tiny executable but with a 1.5G shared/private file mapping if you
prefer), 300M of shm (or 300M of anonymous memory if you prefer) and 200M as
filesystem cache?
The application have a misc I/O load that in some part will run out
of the working set, what's wrong with this?
What's ridiculous? Please elaborate.
To emulate that workload we only need to mmap(1.5G, MAP_PRIVATE or MAP_SHARED),
fault into it, and run bonnie.
