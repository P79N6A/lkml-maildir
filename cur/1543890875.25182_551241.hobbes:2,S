Hi,
Since you are using libata ata_piix driver and not IDE piix one
Jeff and/or Alan are the right people to ask this question...
Anyway...

Shouldn't really matter since it is for multi-word DMA transfers
and this device is using UDMA transfers.

-m is for multi sector PIO transfers and probably won't help here
Everything (except harmless "abnormal status" garbage) seems fine.
Where does the max 40MB/s come from?  Were you able to get this device to
work with this speed using some other controller and/or other OS-es?
Thanks,
Bart
