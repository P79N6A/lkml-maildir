The idea is to avoid regressions in arch/ppc; maintaining feature parity 
isn't necessary.  If, as you say above, 8xx i2c was already broken in 
2.6 (even in arch/ppc), then I see no reason not to go to an of_device 
right away.

Actually, I plan to do some arch/powerpc 8xx work over the next couple 
months, so hopefully it will change soon. :-)
