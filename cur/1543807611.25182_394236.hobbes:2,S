To say this more simplistically, the LGPL essentially says "Even if  
dynamic linking constitutes making a derivative work, we allow you to  
dynamically link, so long as the rules are followed for the LGPL code  
to which you link".  The GPL essentially says "If dynamic linking is  
making a derivative work, then these rules apply to the whole  
derivative work and all of its constituent parts".
Whether or not an NVidia binary module is a derivative work is left  
up to the courts to decide.  It _may_ be legal (don't trust me,  
consult your lawyer) to have a very simple cross-platform interface  
and some BSD-licensed glue.  On the other hand, if your interface  
derives from or exposes any kind of kernel-internals, then it is most  
certainly a derivative work (because you can't argue that the binary  
interface was written to be independent of Linux, and it therefore  
falls under the GPL.
