Ok, there's a test9-pre3 there now..
The SCSI stuff is pretty straightforward, and it works for me (and I also
built a kernel with all regular x86-capable SCSI drivers included, so the
others got at least that level of testing). But there are some non-x86
scsi drivers out there etc, so give it a whirl.
Basic approach: remove all #ifdef MODULE, and get rid of the hosts.c
hardcoded listing of SCSI devices - let SCSI controller drivers do their
own initialization.

----
 - pre1:
    - USB: OHCI controller unlink and bandwidth reclamation fixes
    - USB: storage update
    - sparc64: register window race. Non-deadlock rwlocks.
    - name clash in hamradio/pi2.c and hamradio/pt.c  
    - epic100 credits, 8139too driver update, sr.c initcalls
    - acenic update
    - NFS sillyrename fixups
    - mktime(). Do it just once - not 16 times.
    - misc small fixes to random drivers by Tigran
    - IDE driver picks up master/slave relationships on its own.
    - truncate unmapped/uptodate case handled correctly
    - don't do notifier locking at low level: higher levels do (or
      should do) this already. 
    - ACPI interpreter updates (and file renames - making this part big)
    - SysKonnect gigabit driver update
    - 3c59x driver update
    - pcmcia debounce logic. Ugh.
    - MM balancing (Rik Riel)
 - pre2:
    - "extern inline" -> "static inline".  It doesn't matter right now,
      but it's proactive for future gcc versions.
    - various net drvr updates and fixes
    - more initcall updates
    - PPC updates (including PPC-related drivers etc)
    - disallow re-mounting same filesystem in same place multiple times.
      Too confusing. And /etc/mtab gets strange.
    - Riel VM update
    - sparc updates
    - PCI bridge scanning fix: assign numbers properly
    - network updates
    - scsi fixes
 - pre3:
    - uninitialized == zero. Remove extra initializers.
    - block_prepare_write and block_truncate_page: if the page is
      up-to-date, then so are the buffer heads inside it once they
      are mapped..
    - SCSI initialization - move over to the modular case. No more
      double initialization.
    - Sync up with Alans 2.2.x driver changes
    - networking updates (iipv6 works non-modular etc)
    - netfilter update
    - adfs correct dentry operations
    - ARM update (including ARM drivers)
    - acenic driver update
    - floppy: we'd better hold the io_request_lock when playing with "CURRENT".
    - NFS cache coherency across file locking fix
    - NFS over TCP - handle TCP socket writability right..
    - USB updates
