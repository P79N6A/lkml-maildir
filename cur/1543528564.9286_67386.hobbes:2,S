Will we see support for the above in 2.2.x in the future, or will we
hav to wait till 2.4? I was hand merging in the patches from Andre
Hedrick, but the last version was for 2.2.10, and the web page has
gone. I was getiing:
  hda: set_multmode: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
  hda: set_multmode: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
in /var/log/messages, and the performance sucked. 
thanks.
