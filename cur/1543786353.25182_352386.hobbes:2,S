What is the lifetime of this script?  The reason I am asking is that
somehow, the 'linux' directory got emptied when I used mc to make a
copy of it to /usr/src/linux-2.6.14-rc2, which then built just fine
and I'm running it.
But editing the script so that it only does the stuff from the rsync
line on, I have not been able to duplicate its flawless performance,
instead getting this near the end of the proceedure:
------
[...]
tags/v2.6.14-rc2
sent 563 bytes  received 2778 bytes  954.57 bytes/sec
total size is 779  speedup is 0.23
rsync: link_stat
"/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git/objects/info/alternates"
(in pub) failed: No such file or directory (2)
rsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at
main.c(812)
------
I have now re-ran this 4 times, each time doing an rm -fR on the
'linux' directory, with the same results as above each time.
Is this normal, or am I missing something important (and probably
a 'duh' moment too) that it takes to do a re-run?
