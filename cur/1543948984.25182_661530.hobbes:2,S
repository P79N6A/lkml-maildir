I actually have a TiBook 400 myself, but so far without Linux, and its 
FireWire PHY is dead.  But I can use CardBus FireWire cards on it to do 
basic testing on a big endian PC, and I can test the selfID 
byte-swapping by the PHY-less onboard controller.
I now started a Fedora 8 live CD (self-test says the medium is 
corrupt... need to burn another one) and dmesg says:
firewire_ohci: Added fw-ohci device 0002:24:0e.0, OHCI version 1.0
firewire_ohci: recursive bus reset detected, discarding self ids
[...]
The second line looks like this is indeed one of those which needs the 
header byte-swap workaround which ohci1394 has but firewire-ohci hasn't yet.
On the weekend I'm going to attempt to put Linux on this PowerBook, at last.
