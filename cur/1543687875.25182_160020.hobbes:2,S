your patch clearly simplifies things. Would you mind to also extend the
rebalance-frequency based balancing to the SMP scheduler, and see what
effect that has? Ie. to remove much of the 'tick' component from the SMP
scheduler as well, and make it purely frequency based.
I'm still afraid of balancing artifacts if we lose track of time (which
the tick thing is about, and which cache affinity is a function of), but
maybe not. It would certainly unify things more. If it doesnt work out
then we can still do your stuff for the cross-node balancing only.
