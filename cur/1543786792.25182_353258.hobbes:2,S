Yes I've heard this argument before, and it works for ARRAY_SIZE, but I'm
not sure it'll be okay for all macros we use, the other thing is I've no
idea what BSD or Solaris have or don't have, so if we just DRM_ most
things it makes it less likely we'll have a namespace clash later on ...
I'm not really caring either way though, I prefer to leave it as is unless
someone comes up with a really good reason as I'm lazy by nature, and I
don't think it really affects anyone either way... there are a lot worse
things in the drm that need looking at on my list before I start worrying
about naming macros...
Dave.
