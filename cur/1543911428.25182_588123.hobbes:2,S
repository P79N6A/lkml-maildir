It doesn't mean that (volatile int*) cast is bad, it means that current gcc
is bad (or "not good enough"). IOW: instead of avoiding volatile cast,
it's better to fix the compiler.

Linus, in all honesty gcc has many more cases of suboptimal code,
case of "volatile" is just one of many.
Off the top of my head:
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28417
unsigned v;
void f(unsigned A) { v = ((unsigned long long)A) * 365384439 >> (27+32); }
gcc-4.1.1 -S -Os -fomit-frame-pointer t.c
f:
        movl    $365384439, %eax
        mull    4(%esp)
        movl    %edx, %eax <===== ?
        shrl    $27, %eax
        movl    %eax, v
        ret
Why is it moving %edx to %eax?
gcc-4.2.1 -S -Os -fomit-frame-pointer t.c
f:
        movl    $365384439, %eax
        mull    4(%esp)
        movl    %edx, %eax <===== ?
        xorl    %edx, %edx <===== ??!
        shrl    $27, %eax
        movl    %eax, v
        ret
Progress... Now we also zero out %edx afterwards for no apparent reason.
