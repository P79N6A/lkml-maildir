kmod in the kernel is trying to demand load unix domain sockets with
'modprobe -s -k unix'.  modprobe gets some error.  Because modprobe
was given "-s", it calls syslog to record the error.  syslog tries to
use a unix domain socket, causing the kernel to again 'modprobe -s -k unix'
again, continuing the recursive cycle.
I am not sure why you are getting an error in the first place though,
especially that error.  Do you perhaps have a custom module of your own
named "unix"?
By the way, a bunch of x86 machines at Yggdrasil at this moment are running
the same 2.2.1 kernel binary that is built with unix domain sockets
as a loadable module, so rest assured that it can be done.  On the
other hand, there is a kludge in each of the different initial ramdisks
that these identical fully modularized kernels boot that disables loading
of the unix domain sockets module until the hard disk is mounted
and a new conf.modules has been automatically generated from the
machine's detected hardware configurations  This is to prevent just
the scenario you are describing if there is a problem with the initial
modprobe configuration.
