Increasing struct slab size doesn't sound too appealing. I don't think the 
slab allocator should know about mempools. Your critical allocations and 
regular slab allocations have very different needs. For regular 
allocations, we want to avoid page allocation which is why the object 
caches hold on to slab pages whereas for mempool, I think you almost 
always want to give back unused memory to the pool.
I think a better way to go is to improve the mempool implementation to 
allow non-fixed size allocations and then combine that with the slab 
allocator to get what you need.
