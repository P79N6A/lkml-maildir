VM_LOCKED means that someone did mlock() and the VMA isn't eligible for
paging.
PG_locked is very different: it provides the caller with exclusive access
the page while its actual contents are being changed.  It's also used as a
synchronisation point for adding to and removing from pagecache.  It's
pretty much a pagecache concept rather than an MM concept.
PG_reserved does mean that the page is "special" and the VM should just
leave the thing alone - some device driver owns the page and knows how to
manage it.
VM_RESERVED is a bit of a mystery, really and we've had some trouble over
the semantics of this vs PG_reserved.  Presumably it's supposed to be like
PG_reserved, only for whole mmap regions.  It may not work properly because
it gets damn little testing.
We really should have gone through and rationalised, consolidated and
documented the PageReserved/VM_RESERVED code in the 2.5 cycle but it didn't
happen.  The most noxious part is all the testing of PG_reserved in the
core kernel page refcounting logic.
