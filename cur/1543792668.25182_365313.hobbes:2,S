No, no, that is not MY way. That is the 2.6 way.
 (see 
http://lwn.net/Articles/64444/
).
With the old API (kernel_thread) there was no way (at least, direct
way) to bind a thread to a cpu, which i actually need. And this is not
MY own approach , it is used throught the kernel:
* migration thread at sched.c:
           
http://lxr.linux.no/source/kernel/sched.c#L4196
* ksoftirqd thread at softirq.c:
           
http://lxr.linux.no/source/kernel/softirq.c#L350
* worker thread used in workqueues:
           
http://lxr.linux.no/source/kernel/workqueue.c#L182
...and so on
All these threads are standard and well debugged, and all use the API
which I was talking about. Of course, as they are included in the
official kernel sources, none of them is stopped at module unload
time.
Thus, all I want to know is why kthread_stop() cant be called at
module unload time, if the cleanup code can sleep and if there is a
workaround for that.
I hope my questions are clearer now.
Thanks for your help
Aritz
