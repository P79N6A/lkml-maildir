I suppose I don't really care. The __add is no longer just add, and
mix was the word that came to mind. But it doesn't really describe it
well either.

I'm gonna call this last iteration done. Repasted below for akpm's
benefit. Urgency: medium-ish.

This patch fixes a problem where /dev/urandom can return duplicate
values when two processors read from it at the same time.  It relies
on the fact that we already are taking a lock in add_entropy_words(),
and atomically hashes in some freshly mixed in data into the returned
randomness.
