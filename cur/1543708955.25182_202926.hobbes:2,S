They are, until you count the number of occurances.
My solution, as given, puts #if crud in just 6 files.
The existing situation has crud all over the place,
growing day by day.
If there is some patch merging issue, I'd be happy
to send you a separate patch for ppc64.
If you'd prefer, I can create <linux/bit_types.h>
for these types and pull that in. For now it would
be included by all the asm-*/types.h files. Like so:
#if defined(_BROKEN_USER_TYPES) && !defined(__KERNEL__)
typedef unsigned long __u64;
typedef __signed__ long __s64;
#else
#if defined(__GNUC__)
__extension__ typedef unsigned long long __u64;
__extension__ typedef __signed__ long long __s64;
endif
#endif
