Hi,
	I've been getting this error for my brand new (2 months old) Samsung
HDD. The model Number is: SV0411N, and it is a 40GB disk. I'm using the
kernel version 2.4.20-8 provided by RedHat. When I used RH-7.2(before
upgrading to RH-9), the same HDD worked fine. Also, when I re-installed
RH-7.2, it worked fine?
Any suggestions?
Please cc me the reply, sine I'm not subscribed.
Thanks ;-)
