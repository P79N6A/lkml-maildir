I'm sure that a couple of tens of thousands of well-informed
Open-Source/Free Speech proponents attending Sklyarovs trial would draw
attention.
Similarly a large manifestion on the day of the hearing on SSSCA,
preferably with known (important!) professors, scientists, authors, etc
giving lectures on why DMCA/SSSCA is so bad for
freedom/economy/whatever, would probably give quite some
column-millimetres.

I think few, if anyone, has said anything such.
But I do know, that an Alan at home, co-working with his under-ground
cluster of gnomes, does a hell-of-a-lot more good for free software
than an Alan in a US-prison as yet another victim of "justice".

Ahhhh. So you argue, that this is a publicity-stunt pulled by Alan,
and at the same time complain about the fact that the people fighting
the DMCA/SSSCA don't get enough attention? That is, you complain about
an alleged attempt to pull attention to an idiotic law, yet whine about
the fact that it's hard to get enough attention about this law?
