Yes, I do very much intend to test it on real hardware.  I have a couple 
of Kurobox HGs which desperately need a 21st century kernel.  I still 
need to install U-boot on it, but first I'm just going to test the 
vmlinux with the loader.o kernel module.  (And my rs232 voltage 
converters haven't gotten here yet, so I'm being a little conservative 
about all of this.)

Yeah, thunderbird sucks for this stuff.  Keep nagging me and I'll set up 
mutt again. :)  Thanks!
