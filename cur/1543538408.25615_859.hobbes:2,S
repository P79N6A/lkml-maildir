Hi, I have PIII/500 with 256MB of RAM with a Mylex AccelRaid 250
attached to a 80GB RAID-5 array. This box is an NFS server running
2.2.15 with SourceForge NFS patches and nfs-utils-0.1.19.1 
I am seeing the following errors in /var/log/messages even after doing
a complete fsck on all the partitions. Does this mean there is some
hardware corruption or anything else. 
The system hangs when placed under some NFS load. Is there anything I
can/should do to provide more information
EXT2-fs error (device rd(48,5)): ext2_check_inodes_bitmap: Wrong free inodes count in group 337, stored = 16088, counted = 16085
EXT2-fs error (device rd(48,5)): ext2_check_inodes_bitmap: Wrong free inodes count in group 338, stored = 16090, counted = 16089
EXT2-fs error (device rd(48,5)): ext2_check_inodes_bitmap: Wrong free inodes count in group 339, stored = 16091, counted = 16090
EXT2-fs error (device rd(48,5)): ext2_check_inodes_bitmap: Wrong free inodes count in super block, stored = 5471066, counted = 5470713
