Why not ask on every boot? (and yes, the passphrase could be stored on a
fixed disk location - hashed with a function of sufficient complexity
and number of bits, just to warn the user if he does a typo, couldn't
it?). If suspend is working, you basically never reboot. So why ask on
suspend _and_ resume? This also solves the "suspend on lid close" issue.
And a resume is - in the beginning - a boot, so just ask early enough
(maybe the bootloader could do this?)
I'm not a crypto expert at all, just thinking loud...
