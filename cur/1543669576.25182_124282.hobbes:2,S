The main problem of open source software development and open source
programming is, that most developers bang out a cool "skeleton
solution" or a "two weeks project" and after that, hope that some
volunteers will fill up the spaces that they left when they turned to
the next "cool skeleton solution".
Thats' why 90+% of the project on sf are dead and of the rest, most
are in a "beta" state.
