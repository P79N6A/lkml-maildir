Hi, everybody,
I need your help!
1. How can I switch to another virtual terminal by
normal user process?
VT_ACTIVATE ioctl can only be called by processes
having root rights.
2. When I switch away from and again back to the
virtual terminal where I do frame buffer drawing,
screen content is destroyed and replaced by original
console text?
How can I avoid this problem?
3. What is FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP? What does it do?
4. How can I do flipping between primary frame and
secondary frame?
