I kind of like the phrase "blatant layering violation" - catchy, isn't
it?  The main reason people think of ZFS as a blatant layering
violation is because it has the letters "FS" in the name, but it does
a lot more than a file system.  ZFS actually includes three distinct
layers with well-defined interfaces, none of which directly maps to
most people's conception of a "file system."
The really painfully short summary of the layers is:
SPA - Storage Pool Allocator, disks go into the bottom, virtually
addressed, explicitly freed/allocated blocks come out of the top
DMU - Data Management Unit, virtually addressed blocks go in the
bottom, plain objects come out the top (an object is like a file with
no dangly bits like permissions, etc.)
ZPL - ZFS POSIX Layer, plain objects go in the bottom, VFS ops come
out the top
For a really nice, much more detailed ZFS source tour, see:
