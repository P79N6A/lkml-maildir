As far as the capability module is concerned, ping can be setuid and can
drop all other capabilities at startup, so you can approximate the
above.  As far as SELinux is concerned, you can bound the capabilities
that ping can exercise based on its security context even if ping runs
as uid 0 and is granted full capabilities by the capability module,
regardless of whether ping ever drops capabilities itself.  So there are
in-tree ways to achieve what you want.

I doubt you'd drop capability altogether.  You could incrementally
enable the direct granting of capabilities based on SELinux security
context by defining a new class in its policy (cap_override) that
mirrors the existing capability class, and modifying SELinux to
authoritatively grant the capability if it is allowed in that class for
the process' security context; otherwise, you fall back to the existing
combined behavior of requiring both SELinux+capability (or SELinux
+dummy) to grant the capability.  That is simple enough from a code
perspective.  You just need to be careful about the implications for
userspace and policy configuration, to avoid introducing security holes
in this manner.

Given the extensible nature of the security xattr namespace, it is
already possible to store the capability bits in the filesystem (just by
beginning to use security.effcap, security.inhcap, ...).  The code
modifications to the capability module should be simple.  But modifying
userspace to set and preserve those attributes would take some work,
work which has already been done for the SELinux attributes, and you'd
have to figure out the right set of capability bits for each program,
which doesn't scale very well (vs. using equivalence classes as in
SELinux types).  And the capability evolution logic has always been
problematic, vs. explicit transition definitions as in SELinux.  So fs
caps doesn't seem very promising to me as a path forward.
