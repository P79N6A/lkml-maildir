I think you're misunderstanding the match_token() interface.  The
comment before match_token() says:
 * @table: match_table_t describing the set of allowed option tokens and the
 * arguments that may be associated with them. Must be terminated with a
 * &struct match_token whose pattern is set to the NULL pointer.
and that's exactly what already exists here:
 	{Opt_gid,	"gid=%u"},
 	{Opt_err,	NULL},
So your patch is effectively an obfuscated NOP.
