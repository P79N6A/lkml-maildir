I do not have anything against guest-eth0 - eth0 pairs _if_ they are set up
by the host administrators explicitly for some purpose.
For example, if these guest-eth0 and eth0 devices stay as pure virtual ones,
i.e. they don't have any physical NIC, host administrator may route traffic
to guestXX-eth0 interfaces to pass it to the guests.
However, I oppose the idea of automatic mirroring of _all_ devices appearing
inside some namespaces ("guests") to another namespace (the "host").
This clearly goes against the concept of namespaces as independent realms,
and creates a lot of problems with applications running in the host, hotplug
scripts and so on.

Then what to do if the host system has 10.0.0.1 as a private address on eth3,
and then interfaces guest1-tun0 and guest2-tun0 both get address 10.0.0.1
when each guest has added 10.0.0.1 to their tun0 device?

Andrey
