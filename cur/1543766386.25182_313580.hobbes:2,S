I think rc3 has code from rc2-mm2/3.  Both of these reboot here randomly.  Nothing
shows up on a serial console...  Think something is seriously wrong with x86_64 in rc3.
That being said its possible its fixed in HEAD by.
[PATCH] x86_64: fix new out of line put_user()
[PATCH] x86_64: Bug in new out of line put_user()
some people have reported reversing (in -mm)
sched-unlocked-context-switches.patch
Helps too.
