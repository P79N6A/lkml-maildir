For multiple lines, wings are a Good Thing (TM). Otherwise it looks
sloppy.
  /* Service input, then unset the BREAK to
   * release the Waker. */
extra asterisk! ok then
  /* Service input, then unset the BREAK to
     release the Waker. */
Yuck, that "release" looks like it can be code, especially with parsers
that look for comments that start with some sort of /* or *
Those little wings do IMHO make the code look nicer. I know in the Linux
community, my weight compared to you is a chihuahua compared to a
St. Bernard.  But in this case, I believe others think that my collar is
prettier than yours. ;-)
Some one buy Rusty a bigger hard-drive to store those extra lines.
