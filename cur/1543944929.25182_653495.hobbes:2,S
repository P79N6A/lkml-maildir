I verified tbench regression is not caused by the same patch. I am digging tbench now.

I got oprofile data but it didn't show clear evidence.
When doing volanoMark testing, vmstat showed the good kernel's context switch
is about 1100000, but the bad kernel's context switch is 720000. Good kernel's
idle is about 1%, and bad kernel's idle is about 5%.

I used some scripts to start volanoMark.
Netperf loop UDP-RR-1/512's 10% regression on 16-core tigerton is also related to the patch.
If I set CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED=n, there is no the netperf regression. I bind the netserver
process to a core and bind the client to another core in another processor.
It's hard to debug into netperf regression if it's caused by scheduler.

Yes.

Yes.
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED=y
CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHED=y

No regression if CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED=n.
