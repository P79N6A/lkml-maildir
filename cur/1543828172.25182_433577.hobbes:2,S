I forgot to add: when turning RA off for the device before reading
the disk, read errors are propagated to the application quickly,
without those long delays and attempts to read all the bad blocks.
Ofcourse (with conv=noerror), dd will request next blocks anyway,
but it stays responsive still, and reports each error quickly.
The patch helps still: after first batch of attempts to read,
RA gets reduced, when follows next (much smaller) batch, and
finally RA is set to 0, and the above 'quick route' (as if
RA was turned off initially) takes effect.
