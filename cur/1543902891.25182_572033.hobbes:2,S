Subject: [PATCH]: update coredump path in kernel to not check coredump rlim if core_pattern is a pipe
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hey-
	Patch to update do_coredump such that it ignores RLIMIT_CORE in the
event that core_pattern is a pipe.  RLIMIT_CORE is meant to prevent dumping
cores that are to large for the filesystem they are being written to for a given
user id.  If the core_pattern points to a pipe, the core isn't written to disk,
but rather sent to a spawned reader utility, negating the need for the check.
If the pipe reader later decides to write the core to disk, the reading process
is bound by the quotas and permissions that the target filesystem has set on it.
Thanks and Regards
Neil
