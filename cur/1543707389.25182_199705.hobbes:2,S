I have seen this same Treason uncloaked! error message between two of my
Linux systems recently, while running rsync backups between them.  One
system is 2.4.21, the other 2.6.2.  I was not using any shaping.
I was trying to figure it out, but I cannot reproduce it reliably, it
seems to just happen.
