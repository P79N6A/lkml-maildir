That's IMHO not brain-damaged, but pure physics: just consider scratches
or dust (or other substances) applied to the touch foil. This happens
all the time, so the touch screen gets out of calibration. This won't
happen on a screen used only twice a day. But think about a touch screen
that's tortured all the day with pencils, finger rings, dirty fingers,
...

Min/Max values (as of protocol theory) is possibly not the very best you
can do with the hardware. I more thing about submitting these (after
physical calibration) to the kernel driver to supply them to it's users.

Is this done eg. by Elo, Mutouch, Fujitsu, T-Sharc (to only name the
most common)? I don't think so...

This only happens if you don't configurethe MSR properly :-) Most of
them can be configured to send quite complex (as in: structured) init
sequences that cannot be generated by a keyboard (ie multiple break
codes without make codes and the like).
