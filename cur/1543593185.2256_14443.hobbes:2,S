Unfortunately, at least X and few framebuffer modes can not survive
that too well.
vesafb ypan mode attempts to do video-to-video copy, which is slow.
Xserver attempts that, too.

But they can't be posted indifinitely, right? I'm copying whole
framebuffer at a time, I do not believe PCI has enough buffers to
cache *that*. [Or is it using some kind of burst mode it can not use
for reading? That does not give a sense, you can cache reads, too....]
