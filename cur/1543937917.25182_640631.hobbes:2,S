The others need to be irq_handler_t because that's the precise type 
that's being used in each particularly situation.  Each time the code 
re-creates that definition creates a problem for future irq handler 
changes of any type, really.
As I noted, I've fixed all this crap already, and read through each one 
of those drivers.
