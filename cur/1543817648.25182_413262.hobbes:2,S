LOCAL_MAP_NR does not take a kernel virtual address.  If you look at how
it's defined (Eg):
#define LOCAL_MAP_NR(addr) \
        (((unsigned long)(addr) & 0x07ffffff) >> PAGE_SHIFT)
then you will notice that it's actually converting an offset into a node
into an index.  This means that converting a PFN to a virtual address is
just a complete and utter waste of time.
So:
> -#define arch_local_page_offset(pfn, nid) (LOCAL_MAP_NR((pfn) << PAGE_OFFSET))
> +#define arch_local_page_offset(pfn, nid) (LOCAL_MAP_NR(__va((pfn) << PAGE_SHIFT)))
this should be:
#define arch_local_page_offset(pfn, nid) LOCAL_MAP_NR((pfn) << PAGE_SHIFT)
Please also avoid the over-use of parens.  It's a disease which just makes
things harder to read (eg, the have I got enough close parens at the end
of the line to balance.)
