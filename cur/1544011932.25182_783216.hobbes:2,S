There's a BUG messages in the log and several IRQ enable/disable
messages && once timeout happens on one of the ata port, the other one
begins to time out too.  I'm out of ideas and think this really needs
a look from someone who knows xen.  It doesn't seem to be a libata
problem at this point.
Thanks.
