I implemented this feature with your workload in mind. This is what i

'the common case' == ordinary (non-RT) Linux boxes! When i implement
scheduler features i'm always trying to make them as generic as
possible, i.e. this feature too is structured to be as upstream
mergeable as possible. For that purpose the change had to be
low-overhead in the common, non-RT case. It is easy to hack the
scheduler to fix some RT issue but break the generic scheduler - this
solution is not meant to be such a hack.
