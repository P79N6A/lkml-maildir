I tested it with 2.2.12-pre4 and it worked fine for me. The box
seams still resonably responsive with / mounted sync, so if it's 
safer, I want it.
Anyway this is the kind of patch that I'd really like to see
comments on from Linux big names. Either it's conceptualy
broken and I'd (and probably many others) like to know why,
or it's the kind of thing that we definetly want in all
standard trees, even if it's not 100% granting agains meta data
corruption.
Lastly, I bet you'd better refine the sentence:
'Just mount ext2fs with "sync" option, ext2fs will keep
consistency of filesystem. Your filesystem would never be broken.'

Do you mean that you force the controler and disk to write meta
datas in the right order to the disk, or do you assume that
there is no order problem at controler and disk cache level ?
