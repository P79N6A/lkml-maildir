I'd rather be careful with that..... mm is enough for now. Why go to the 
extremes immediately. If it is an option then people can gradually start 
testing with it.

Uhhh.... Right. So SLUB wont work if the lowest page table block is 
managed via slabs.

ARCH_USES_SLAB_PAGE_STRUCT to disable SLUB on these platforms.
