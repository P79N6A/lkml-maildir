Yes in general page cache and other global caches should be spread 
around all nodes by default. There was a patch to do this for the page 
cache in SLES9 for a long time, but d/icache and possibly other slab
caches have of course the same problem. For doing IO caching it doesn't matter much if 
the cache is local or not because memory access in read/write is not that
critical. But it's a big problem when one node fills up with 
IO (or dentry or inode) caches because an IO intensive process ran
on it on some time and later a process running there cannot get local
memory.
Of course there might be some corner cases where using local
memory for caching is still better (like mmap file IO), but my 
guess is that it isn't a good default.
