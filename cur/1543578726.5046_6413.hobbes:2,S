As far as I know the same as on FIC VA-503+, that is vt82c598 north and
vt82c586b south - the MVP3 chipset. I've got the VA-503+ here and it
works really well. the 503+ and the 2013 differ only in form factor, one
is Baby AT (503+) and the other is ATX.
It's vt82c586b, and most probably 3041 silicon - the most bugless VIA
southbridge I know of ...
Weird. Could the person who reported it test the 2.4.0 kernel? I think
the 2.2 drivers had some MVP3 (and 3041 silicon)  related bugs. 3041 has
some registers layed out differently from all other chips.
Btw, this is not the 586 nor 586a, so changing the test to test for just
these two probably won't be the right thing to do ...
