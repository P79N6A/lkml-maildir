Hi Dave,
I have verified that booting the system with iommu=off (with vanilla
kernel) does seem to make the problem go away.
I apologize for not being fully up to speed with knowing what relationship
the iommu has with the gart, but I will find out.
I just wanted to post my findings.
Thanks again!
Best Regards,
Arthur Perry
