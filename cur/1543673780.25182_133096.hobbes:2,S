Maybe. Though, eisa is still a sane bus, where we get ids and slot 
numbers etc. The isa code is pretty much a free for all.

Yes, agreed. Probably the easiest way to this is something like an 
isa_reserve_(region/resources) that checks if either eisa or pnp know 
about anything at the place where we are going to probe. This keeps isa 
autoprobe from blindly stealing everything it can get it's hands on, and 
lets the higher level buses have priority over it.
This also brings up the question of whether something from eisa/pnp 
should also be registered on the isa bus.

Yeah, basically all we need is something that says "this is my device, 
give it to me later".

Right now, it is basically first come, first serve. request_region keeps 
people from stepping on each other toes. So, once a driver finds a 
region it likes it keeps it and nobody else can touch it. I think it is 
probably best to keep it this way.
