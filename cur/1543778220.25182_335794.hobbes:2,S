Is do_gettimeofday supposed to be monotonous? I'm seeing time go backward by
tiny amounts, and then progressing.
I'm using do_gettimeofday on a single processor, CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y, and
saving stuff from generic_make_request - see 
http://ds9a.nl/diskstat
 for the
source. 2.6.13-rc3-mm1, HZ=250.
I'll try to figure out how much it is going back, and it is some kind of
magic interval.
Is there another monotonous clock in the kernel that doesn't wrap (all
that often)? Doesn't really need to be wall time.
Thanks!
