I bought it, but the GDB testsuite didn't.  Both copies seem to be
necessary; there's generally no signal handler for SIGTRAP, so moving
it disables the test in the most common case.  I didn't poke at it long
enough to figure out what the failing case was, but it introduced a
different situation which could leave TF enabled. This, however,
worked:
If a debugger set the TF bit, make sure to clear it when creating a
signal context.  Otherwise, TF will be incorrectly restored by
sigreturn.
