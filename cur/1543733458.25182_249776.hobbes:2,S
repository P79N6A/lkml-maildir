  Yes, but backup programs always needed to be taught about new
  features. Be it new type of files, attributes or meta-data. I think
  that teaching backup applications is far better than teaching every
  application.

  Yes, this seem to be one solution. It isn't very dynamic in usage
  though. You can't use this directly from applications wihout
  manually doing the mount.
  This is only a solution to browsing contents of files. It doesn't
  provide a solution for using meta-data streams or other things like
  this.
