Well, I'm not exactly a kernel hacker even if I did some minor driver work in 
the past, so don't rate my advice too high :)
Anyhow, I lurk l-k regularly and most of the developing tools that appear in 
discussions among real kernel hackers appear to be the standard GNU tools.
I did personally try out some of the open source IDE like sourcenav and 
kdevelop, but the raw size of the kernel code pushed them to or beyond their 
limits. That was a couple of years ago things may have changed.
Other stuff that come to mind are: a decent mailer (Mozilla Mail should 
qualify :), a decent irc client, bk or if you prefer cvs. I saw ctags cited 
at times, but I didn't use it myself. 
Hope this helps,
Alessandro
