Yes, this does make a difference, here the results of running
   dd if=/dev/full of=/dev/sd?1 bs=4M count=4883
on 8 disks at the same time:
   34.273340
   33.938829
   33.598469
   32.970575
   32.841351
   32.723988
   31.559880
   29.778112
That's 32.710568 MB/s on average per disk with your change and without
it it was 24.958557 MB/s on average per disk.
I will do more tests tomorrow.
Thanks,
Holger
