   hcd.c: In function `usb_hcd_pci_probe':
   hcd.c:627: `irq' undeclared (first use in this function)
   hcd.c:627: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
   hcd.c:627: for each function it appears in.)
Go to line 627 in an editor and change "irq" to be "dev->irq"
The same build failure got introduced when this code was merged
into the 2.5.x tree and I had to fix it there too.
