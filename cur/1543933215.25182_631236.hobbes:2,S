The problem is that the IT87xxF chips do decode 4 ports (recent chips,
0x294-0x297) or 8 ports (older chips, 0x290-0x297), not 2 as the
datasheets say. The ITE Super-I/O chips differ from the Winbond
Super-I/O chips in this respect. The it87 driver only needs to access
ports 0x295 and 0x296, true, but the device itself decodes more
addresses than that. So, with this proposed patch, ports which are busy
will be shown as being free. This pretty much voids the point of
resource declarations, doesn't it? This might not cause too much
trouble in practice, but to me this still looks like the wrong way to go.
The resource declarations made by these motherboard BIOSes are totally
bogus. 0x290-0x29f is much larger than what the chip decodes.
0x290-0x294 is a subset that doesn't make any sense. The GA-K8N Ultra 9
is even funnier with 0x295-0x314, which again doesn't correspond to
anything real. All these happen to not intersect with 0x295-0x296 but I
wouldn't count on it. If Gigabyte (and possibly others) care that
little about these declarations, pretty much anything could be seen. So
while your proposed workaround happens to fix the problem at hand, it is
not really correct technically, and could break again soon.
I'd rather fix the problem at its source, or, as fixing it as the source
isn't very realistic in this case, as near of the source as possible.
That would mean DMI-based quirks for the affected motherboards, that
would discard or adjust the bogus resource declarations. I have not yet
looked at what the code would look like, as I am not familiar with the
pnp system driver, I don't know what it would take to implement my
proposal.
I also don't fully understand what pnpacpi is useful for. I have heard
about PCI drivers that might request resources that the motherboard
doesn't want them to touch, but I don't know the details, I also
don't know if it is a theoretical issue or if it really happens on some
systems, and I don't know if there are other uses for pnpacpi. I'm
asking because I want to know if forcing pnpacpi=off on the faulty
motherboards would be good enough or if we really need finer-grained
quirks (assuming that we go the DMI-based quirks route at all.) The
former would obviously be easier.
