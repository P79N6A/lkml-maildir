Doing kexec load in two steps is a possible solution. Although this is a
little complex, we can wrap the two steps into one /sbin/kexec invoking.
That is, When do /sbin/kexec --load-preserve-context
<kernel-image>, /sbin/kexec first call sys_kexec_load() to load the
kernel image and reserving memory, then amend the memory image of loaded
kernel (B) according to the new information available such as return
address and backup pages map. For this solution, something still need to
be solved is how to pass some information back from kernel B
(hibernating kernel) to kernel A (original kernel) and how to pass some
information from kernel C (resuming kernel) to kernel A (original
kernel).
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Another possible solution to pass information between kernels (in user
space): needed information from kernel are passed in stack, and a
special ELF_NOTES is used to access the information in peer kernel.
Details is as follow:
1. Possible information need to be passed:
1.1 From user space (known before sys_kexec_load):
a. ELF core header
b. vmcoreinfo (pointer only)
1.2 From kernel space (known after sys_kexec_load):
a. jump back entry (return address)
b. backup pages map
2. When jumping from kernel A to kernel B:
2.1 In /sbin/kexec --load-preserve-context <kernel-image>, /sbin/kexec
allocate a special ELF_NOTES (ELF NOTES kernel) for information from
kernel space.
2.2 When doing sys_reboot(REBOOT_CMD_KEXEC), kernel put needed
information and physical address of ELF core header onto stack just
before jump to purgatory.
2.3 After jumping to purgatory, purgatory fills "ELF NOTES kernel" with
corresponding address in stack.
2.4 When kernel B is booted, /proc/vmcore is created and the information
form ELF NOTES kernel is available too.
3. When jumping back from kernel B to kernel A and jumping from kernel C
to kernel A:
3.1 Same as 2.1
3.2 Same as 2.2, but there is no purgatory in kernel A, so when
information are put on stack, jump to "jump back entry" of kernel A
directly.
3.3 The code on jump back entry of kernel A will work as a purgatory to
fill "ELF NOTES kernel" with corresponding address in stack.
Then /proc/vmcore reset code is called again to (re-)construct
the /proc/vmcore with new information.
