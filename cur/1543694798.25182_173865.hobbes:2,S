I'm seeing these compile errors:
	LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
	drivers/built-in.o(.init.text+0x4e6b): In function `ide_setup':
	: undefined reference to `cmd640_vlb'
	drivers/built-in.o(.init.text+0x5361): In function `probe_for_hwifs':
	: undefined reference to `ide_probe_for_cmd640x'
	make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
The .config contains:
	CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640=y
but ide/pci/cmd640.c doesn't seem to get compiled. I tried doing it
manually and got a screen full of errors.
