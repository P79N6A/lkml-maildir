I don't know those kernel versions, they appear to be redhat-specific.
But current mainline kernels, both 2.4 and 2.5 have had this check for
a while already. You have to set a config option to enable them.
In principle, there is absolutely no way how linux can tell when the
check will spill over. The check in do_irq simply checks if the kernel
was close, at the time of that interrupt. This is enough to catch
dangerous code paths and fix them, before any real problems occur.
"close" for mainline kernels means, there is less than 1k of free
stack left. Your redhat kernel seems to use 2k, I even go as far as
5k, but that definitely fills my logs. 1786 is the number of bytes
still free on the stack. Should be enough for you.
If you can reproduce something as low as 1786 for a recent 2.4 or 2.5
kernel, I'd be interested in the backtrace. For 2.4.9, I just don't
care. :)
