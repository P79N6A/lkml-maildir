Subject: [2.5.63 and prior] Voodoo3 framebuffer bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Kernel is compiled with gcc version 2.95.4 20010319 (prerelease)
That bug was in previous versions too.
I've got Voodoo3:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: 3Dfx Interactive, Inc. Voodoo 3 (rev 
01) (prog-if 00 [VGA])
         Subsystem: 3Dfx Interactive, Inc. Voodoo3 AGP
         Flags: 66Mhz, fast devsel, IRQ 11
         Memory at e4000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=32M]
         Memory at e8000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=32M]
         I/O ports at c000 [size=256]
         Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled] [size=64K]
         Capabilities: [54] AGP version 1.0
         Capabilities: [60] Power Management version 1
Framebuffer works really strange.
- when I start it in 1024x768-16@75 I have strange colours: background 
is brown-red, other colors are not good too (techno-like style). See 
dump from 1024x768 16bit:

I don't know how to make screenshot on console better, sorry...
- I can't set other refresh rates than 60Hz - from lilo I've passed 
append="video=tdfx:1024x768-16@75", but I've became 60Hz set.
- when I set resolution with fbset to i.e. 1280x1024 I have resolution 
changed but avaible area is in old size.
- when I set resolution to other than passed from lilo: when I switch 
from X, my screen is completely not usable. Manual setting resolution 
(without visibility) makes it usable again - until next switch.
P.S.: sorry for my english - I hope you understand what I mean...
