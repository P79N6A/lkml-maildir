Right.  But, /proc started somewhere, didn't it?
I have the feeling that other systems will duplicate it if it's good.
Even if they don't, it would be more beneficial to me and probably most 
Linux users to have metafs supported in both GNOME and KDE, even if they 
still need an emulation layer to support other systems.
I agree that the emulation layer should be common.

I am trying, at least getting the conceptual glitches ironed out.
But, it does need GNOME/KDE VFS changes in order to be sane -- 
otherwise, GNOME/KDE will duplicate it, creating even more of a mess 
than we already have.
I'm not sure why the thread still lives, but now that I've typed this, I 
may as well send it...
