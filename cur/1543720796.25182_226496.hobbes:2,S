Are user pointers actual pointers?  That's much too tempting to dereference.
If you really want to force user space accesses to follow certain rules, 
make them longs or structs (or at least void *) (depending on 
architecture) so that only the proper user-space-access functions can 
interpret them.
Now, if this "handle" corresponds directly to a user space pointer, 
someone might cast it and dereference it, but that would be easy to 
detect, and such patches would be easy to reject.
Bad idea?
