You seem to be referring to one non-generic function that's
documented as OK to pass DMA-unsafe buffers to.  There are
several other synchronous transfer calls that don't make
such guarantees.

I think the very first version did that, but nothing since
has taken that shortcut.  (Several months now.)  It uses
a buffer that's allocated on the heap.

So that the typical case, with little SPI contention, doesn't
hit the heap?  That's sure what I thought ... though I can't speak
for what other people may think I thought.  You were the one that
wanted to optimize the atypical case to remove a blocking path!

No I didn't.  I actually said that the upper layer drivers should
just not use DMA-unsafe areas for I/O buffers in the first place.
Places like stacks or static data.  Doing that means there's never
a need for a new kmalloc buffer, unless maybe you're marshaling
things into a scratch buffer.

Given the policy that all code avoids DMA-unsafe areas for I/O buffers,
the issue has already been worked out globally.
