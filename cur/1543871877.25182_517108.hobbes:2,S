I don't have that in my inbox anymore so won't reply to it itself
unfortunately, but what it conveyed is also not that nsproxy should be
the 'resource control' object.  If anything it seems to argue that all of
Paul's patchset should be done in userspace.

I disagree.
Sam, there are two very separate concepts here.  Actually three.
What you had originally presented in a patchset was resource
virtualization:  so when process A asks for some resource X, rather than
get resource_table[X] he gets resource_table[hash(x)].  The concensus
you mention at the start, and which you say Eric was arguing for, was to
not do such translation, but just get rid of the global
'resource_table'.  By allowing processes to have and manipulate their
own private resource_table, you implement namespaces.
And as I've said, the nsproxy is just an implementation detail to keep
namespace pointers out of the task struct.  Using nsproxy or not has
nothing to do with the namespace approach versus global resource tables
with id translation at all userspace->kernel boundaries.
So virtualization via explicit translation through global resource
tables is one concept, and private namespaces could be said to be a
second.  The third is resource controls, which Paul's container patchset
implements.  It has nothing to do with the previous two, and it is what
Paul's patches are addressing.
Sam asks:

To keep track of a process' place in any of several hierarchies, where
each node in a tree inherit default values from the parent and can
customize in some way.

Because these have nothing to do with resource controls.
> What does it mean to make a new container? 
It means to create a new set of limits, probably inheriting defaults
from a parent set of limits, customizable but probably within some
limits imposed by the parent.  For instance, if there is a cpuset
container which limits its tasks to cpus 7 and 8, then when a new
container is created as a child of that one, it can be further
restricted, but can never have more than cpus 7 and 8.

If you want to argue that resource controls should be done in userspace
i *suspect* you'll find that approach insufficient but am interested to
see attempts to do so.
But just moving the container structure into nsproxy is just that
- moving the container structure.  Since Sam argues vehemently that
there should be no such thing, I don't see how he can be seen as wanting
to move it.
All that being said, if it were going to save space without overly
complicating things I'm actually not opposed to using nsproxy, but it
looks to me like it does complicate things.  One reason for this is that
through the nsproxy subsystem we are mixing pointers to data (the
namespaces) and pointers to pointers to the same data (nsproxy subsystem
containers pointing to nsproxies) in the same structure.  Yuck.
