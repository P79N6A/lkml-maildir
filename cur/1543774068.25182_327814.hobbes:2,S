Can you revert gregkh-pci-pci-collect-host-bridge-resources-02.patch
from the broken-out patches for 2.6.12-mm1 and see if the problem
goes away? If yes, it could be that the ACPI firmware on this
system is not reporting proper host bridge resources, and all
downstream device resources get messed up..
