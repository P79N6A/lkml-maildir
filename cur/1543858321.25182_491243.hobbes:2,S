Doesn't matter.
IT IS SO FUNDAMENTALLY AND HORRIBLY WRONG THAT I REFUSE TO HAVE IT IN MY 
TREE.
As an "example", the _only_ thing it can possibly ever do is to just 
confuse people - in other words, it's an _anti_example, not a real one.

I'm really not convinced about the user-mode thing unless somebody can 
show me a good reason for it. Not just some "wouldn't it be nice" kind of 
thing. A real, honest-to-goodness reason that we actually _want_ to see 
used.
No features just for features sake.
So please push the tree without this userspace IO driver at all. And if 
you actually have a real user, not just an example, that is worthy and 
shows why such a driver in user space is actually a good thing, _then_ we 
can push that.
In other words, I'd like to see code that uses this that is actually 
_better_ than an in-kernel driver in some way.
For USB, the user-mode thing made sense. You have tons of random devices, 
and the abstraction level is higher to begin with. Quite frankly, I simply 
don't even see the same being true for something like this.
Btw: there's one driver we _know_ we want to support in user space, and 
that's the X kind of direct-rendering thing. So if you can show that this 
driver infrastructure actually makes sense as a replacement for the DRI 
layer, then _that_ would be a hell of a convincing argument.
There may be others. Feel free to fill in the blank: ________.
