Subject: [PATCH 0/3] VFS changes to collapse all the vectored and AIO support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
This work was originally suggested & started by Christoph Hellwig, 
when Zack Brown tried to add vectored support for AIO. These series
of changes collapses all the vectored IO support into single
file-operation method using aio_read/aio_write. 
Christoph & Zack, comments/suggestions ? If you are happy with the
work, can you add your Sign-off or Ack ?
Here is the summary:
[PATCH 1/3] Vectorize aio_read/aio_write methods
[PATCH 2/3] Remove readv/writev methods and use aio_read/aio_write
instead.
[PATCH 3/3] Zack's core aio changes to support vectored AIO.
To Do/Issues:
1) Since aio_read/aio_write are vectorized now, need to modify
nfs AIO+DIO and usb/gadget to handle vectors. Is it needed ?
For now, it handles only single vector. Christoph, should I
loop over all the vectors ?
2) AIO changes need careful review & could be cleaned up further.
Zack, can you take a look at those ?
3) Ben's suggestion of kernel iovec to hold precomputed information
(like total iolen) instead of computing every time.
Thanks,
Badari
