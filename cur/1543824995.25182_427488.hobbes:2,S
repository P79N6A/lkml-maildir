Sure, me too, have been thinking about it ;-)

I'm now using DIV_ROUND_UP(), maybe we can settle with that.

Sorry for being a bit lazy.
It is true that some situations are rather tricky, and some
if()/numbers are carefully chosen. I'll continue expanding/detailing
the documentation with future releases. Or would you prefer to add
them as small and distinct patches?
Comments for this one(also rationalized code):
        /* 
         * Snap to EOF, if the request
         *      - crossed the EOF boundary;
         *      - is close to EOF(explained below).
         * 
         * Imagine a file sized 18 pages, and we dicided to read-ahead the
         * first 16 pages. It is highly possible that in the near future we
         * will have to do another read-ahead for the remaining 2 pages,
         * which is an unfavorable small I/O.
         * 
         * So we prefer to take a bit risk to enlarge the current read-ahead,
         * to eliminate possible future small I/O.
         */
        if (ra->readahead_index + ra_readahead_size(ra)/4 > eof_index) {
                ra->readahead_index = eof_index;
                if (ra->lookahead_index > eof_index)
                        ra->lookahead_index = eof_index;
                ra->flags |= RA_FLAG_EOF;
        }
