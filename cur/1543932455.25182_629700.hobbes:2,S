We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.23.12 kernel.
It just reverts one patch that has been causing some users some
problems.  For details about the problems, see:
	
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9514
If you are not having any problems with the 2.6.23.11 kernel, then there
is no need to upgrade.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.23.11 and 2.6.23.12
The updated 2.6.23.y git tree can be found at:
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.23.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
