If networking patches are sent purely to linux-kernel, they will often
be missed.  Please use netdev@oss.sgi.com, Jean of all people should be
more than aware of netdev@oss.sgi.com as the place to post and discuss
networking patches, not linux-kernel and not privately to Marcelo or
myself.
I only happened to spot this post by accident this time, I'm being
asked a question and I'm not even CC:'d on the email. :-)
