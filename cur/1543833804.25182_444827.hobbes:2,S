Are you supporting the effort if I send in patches that removes the
vmstat.h and then goes and tries to find all the places that fail to
compile because of the removal and adds vmstat.h directly, that the
patches would get accepted?
It would probably need to go into -mm for a bit just to find those
places I missed.
This wouldn't be a problem to do and can be accomplished rather quickly,
but I wont waste any time on it if it is doomed at the start.
