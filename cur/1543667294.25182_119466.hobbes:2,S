The five CRC in a row is what causes the DMA->PIO changedown. That
implies there is a real bug in the error handling locking, or in
the driver handling of that.
Can you throw some printks into the ide code and see what kind of 
a death you get when it tries to change back to PIO.
As to the cable stuff, I'll take a look at it in time, but both
need fixing
