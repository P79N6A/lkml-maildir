It is not a struct on those arches, but array of structs.
Just try:
#include <stdarg.h>
void foo (int x, ...)
{
  va_list ap, ap2;
  va_start (ap, x);
  ap2 = ap;
  va_end (ap);
}
on say x86_64 or ppc32 and you'll see what I mean:
test.c:7: error: incompatible types in assignment
That's why the standard has va_copy so that you can do the
copying portably.
