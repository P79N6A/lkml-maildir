This does not play happily with the sched_domains patches.
Program received signal SIGEMT, Emulation trap.

It appears that x86's arch_init_sched_domains() is blindly assuming that
each CPU's migration thread is running and is pointed to by
rq->migration_thread.  But from the above you'll see that CPU0's migration
thread is running, but CPU1's has never been created, hence the
null-pointer deref.
I'll drop this final patch.  Please reissue it against next -mm.  Thanks.
