If I, for example, make changes across the tree to SKB handling, I'd
like to be able to build as many drivers as possible and fix up the
compile warnings and build failures before _you_ get to see them.
That's why it's a good idea to make drivers available to as many
platforms as possible, even if the hardware isn't necessarily
used there.
