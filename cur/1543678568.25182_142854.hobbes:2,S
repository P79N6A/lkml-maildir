Ah, right, insmod.static.old was indeed missing, I basically assumed
it'd copy that one in automatically (since it worked for 2.4.20), but
apparently, 2.4.20 just worked for no apparent reason while it shouldn't
have.
Adding insmod.static.old to the ramdisk image (add the line 'inst
/sbin/insmod.static.old "$MNTIMAGE/bin/insmod.old"' in /sbin/mkinitrd)
fixed the issue for me. Thanks for the pointer!
Ronald
