Hi,
I have to setup a fast Linux Server for a database application.
I would like to use a Mainboard for 2 Pentium4 CPUs for this.
I found such a board with a Intel I860 chip. Is this chip
supported by the current Kernel v2.4.14 or will I get problems
with this board and Linux?
many thanks,
   Achim Kruemmel
