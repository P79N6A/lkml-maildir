   couldn't reiserfs use asm/unaligned.h like anyone else?
   Seems at least sparc and mips may need the same treatment.
Sparc will act correctly for unaliagned accesses.
It will trap and run very slowly, but it wont' OOPS and
it will give correct results.
This is actually required behavior, I don't know why parisc
is acting differently.
