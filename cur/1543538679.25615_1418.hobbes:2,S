this the error that i got when i compile a new kernel 2.0.32 after the
these instructions 
make mrproper
make menuconfig
make dep 
make zImage
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -D__ASSEMBLY__ -traditional -c
entry.S -o entry.o
/tmp/ccL5M8ZT.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/ccL5M8ZT.s:257: Error: suffix or operands invalid for `call'
make[1]: *** [entry.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel'
make: *** [linuxsubdirs] Error 2
when i want to cop the /arch/i386/boot/zImage to /linux/vmlinuz-2.0.32-new
i got that zImage  is not there
i try the solution that marcello said to avoid make clean but it still the
same problem
