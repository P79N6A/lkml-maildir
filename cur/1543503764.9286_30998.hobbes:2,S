Not a lot. This particulat problem need fairly minimal knowledge about

Of course. It should be.

You just can not do it. You can not "save pointer to userspace for future use
in interrupt handler". That's all.

What you are doing is wrong in first place. Interrupt can be served in
completely different context. Where userspace belond to competely other
process. It can be even on disk ! How you will access data on disk from
interrupt handler ??? You do not need to know much about kernel internals
to understood stupidity of this...
