Interesting that it does this with a 2.2 server and not with a 2.0
server.

Sure.
2.0.36 client to 2.0.36 server:
   Works well.  Able to make hundreds of concurrent connections and
   move 80Mb/s with larger requests.
2.0.36 client to 2.2.2 server:
   300 ms delays on all connections, and frequent packet loss when
   making concurrent connections.
2.2.2 client to 2.0.36 server:
   Works OK.  Performance almost that of 2.0.36<->2.0.36.
   Frequent packet loss under load.
2.2.2 client to 2.2.2 server:
   Performance almost that of 2.0.36<->2.0.36.  Frequent packet loss
   under load.
