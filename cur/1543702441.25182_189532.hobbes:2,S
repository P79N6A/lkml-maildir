I got it to crash the kernel. Build with no sis_fb compiled in, hack the
dri userspace (client non priviledged code) to pass random numbers to
FB_ALLOC/FREE and it oopses.
The checks in the sis_drm for which memory allocator to use also come
out with bogus answers for some module/non-module combinations. Probably
the sis_mm one should be a seperate module since the alternate mm in the
4.3.99x DRM seems exploitable and insufficiently sanity checked.
