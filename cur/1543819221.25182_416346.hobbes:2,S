bahhh I see... the wiki has "change" instead of add.  Now i'm running 
into another problem, I have an XCP qdisc that I have already added via:
tc qdisc add dev ath0 root xcp capacity 54Mbit size 500
therefore when I also try to incorperate loss:
tcq disc add dev ath0 root netem loss .1%
I get:
RTNETLINK answers: File exists
Is it possible to use two qdiscs on the same interface?
Thanks!
George
