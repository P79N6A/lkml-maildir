Taking a bit of an example from Veritas, would it be, at all, feasible
if n+ blocks were used at the end of the disk or partition(beginning
maybe?), to write a specific identifier that is unique to a specific
controller, or to make note of the drive serial number and store that on
the disk somewhere in some agreed upon understood way. 
Much like the private region on a veritas disk or volume. With the extra
accounting, which should only be needed during boot, or during
disk/volume manipulation, one could conceivably always have a sane
device map, all the time. 
As to the rest of the comments lower down on the original mail, I'd say
that this is *a lot* of trouble, versus the opposite, but if implemented
properly would be highly useful. Using LVM and the like, which does
something like this, seems to be fine for most people(even when moving
disks around, etc), but this ability, without the overhead of LVM in the
mix would seem a good idea for some. 
Just my $.02
TIA
