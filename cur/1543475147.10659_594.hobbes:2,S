It is possible, but I do not believe that this thing is really useful.
ARP is enough cheap to prefer background pinging to new syscall,
made in data path. Besides that, it requires, that datagram protocols,
keeping some state (f.e. DNS) become system dependant.
This thing has no chances to live.
Well, I think, when this element will appear (or recognized to be useless)
for IPv6, we will port it back to IPv4.
What's about this case: using user level notifications in this case
is not solution. If target does not answer arp, it is broken,
no advanced tricks will change this fact and any cure is just workaround.
Increasing timeout is the easiest workaround, at least.
