I think some time in the 90's, Chevy considered discontinuing the 
Corvette.  Then they realized that that would kill their business. 
People who would never buy a Corvette buy other GM cars just because the 
Corvette exists.  Lots of reasons:  It's an icon that people recognize, 
it makes them feel that other Chevys will share some of the Corvette 
quality, etc.
