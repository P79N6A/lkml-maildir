It's wrong *wherever* you do it.
The X server should not be re-niced. It was done in the past, and it was 
wrogn then (and caused problems - we had to tell people to undo it, 
because some distros had started doing it by default).
If you have a single client, the X server is *not* more important than the 
client, and indeed, renicing the X server causes bad patterns: just 
because the client sends a request does not mean that the X server should 
immediately be given the CPU as being "more important". 
In other words, the things that make it important that the X server _can_ 
get CPU time if needed are all totally different from the X server being 
"more important". The X server is more important only in the presense of 
multiple clients, not on its own! Needing to renice it is a hack for a bad 
scheduler, and shows that somebody doesn't understand the problem!
