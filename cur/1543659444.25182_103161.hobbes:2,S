At the risk of looking bad replying to myself, I re-generated the HTML
output of the documents. A lot of the figures, especially call graphs did
not come out because latex2html had trouble with macros and the navigation
icons were totally broken. I didn't notice because it is only the PDF I
read myself.
The HTML output is still not as good as it should be so if you see any
inconsistencies, the PDF should be consulted. I'm hoping there is no major
discrepancies left though.
