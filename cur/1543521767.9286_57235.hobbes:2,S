Subject: epic100 driver BROKEN (2.2 and 2.3)

Hello.
We have several machines at work with "SMSC EPIC/100 83c170" network cards.
While using the epic100 driver (version: 1.04 8/23/98) of the kernel, we
experienced several reoccuring hangups/crashes of the network connection. 
It always appears, when transfering large amounts of data (> 200 MB) and only
on the sending side. This was tested with ftp.
On the drivers homepage
(
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/epic100.html
) is a "test version"
(version: 1.07h 8/18/99), which works perfectly fine with 2.2.* kernels. No
problems at all since it got installed about 6 months ago.
Maybe Alan Cox would like to include that driver in the main 2.2 kernel as the
older version is not usable for serious usage. 
The same problem should occur on 2.3 as it is the same driver version.
Please CC answer to me as I am not subscribed to the list.
