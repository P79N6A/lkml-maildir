Yeah, that was not one of the things that we liked either. We tried
other ways to get around the get_task_struct but, ended up with
the get_task_struct in the end anyway.

Caching the rq is an interesting idea. But since the rq struct is local to 
sched.c, what would be a good API to do this?
in mutex.c:
	void *rq;
	[...]
	rq = get_task_rq(owner);
	spin_unlock(&lock->wait_lock);
	[...]
	if (!task_running_on_rq(rq, owner))
in sched.c:
	void *get_task_rq(struct task_struct *p)
	{
		return task_rq(p);
	}
	int task_running_on_rq(void *r, struct task_sturct *p)
	{
		struct rq *rq = r;
		return rq->curr == p;
	}
