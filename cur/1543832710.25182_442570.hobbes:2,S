Well if the i2c code happens to depend on another module, I hope
that Jean would warn us in a timely manner :-). And even if Jean
failed to do so, it would immediately result in a compile
error/warning which should lead to an easy fix.
I still prefer 'select' just because it's easier to parse, but
either way is okay, though your method takes me a few more seconds
to understand.
