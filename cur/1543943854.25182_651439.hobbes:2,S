I was never able to trigger this or get anyone to reliably trigger it with
a debug patch in. Which is why it has taken so long to fix. It looks like
kde4 is triggering this big rash of new reports.
Anyway, I have fixed a race or two and removed that warning code (which was
also a little racy). So I think that should be OK.

That's interesting.
