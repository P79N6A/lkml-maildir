Version 0.0.8 of yaird is now available at:
	
http://www.xs4all.nl/~ekonijn/yaird/yaird-0.0.8.tar.gz
Yaird is a proof of concept perl rewrite of mkinitrd.  It aims to
reliably identify the necessary modules by using the same algorithms
as hotplug, and comes with a template system to to tune the tool for
different distributions and experiment with different image layouts.
It requires a 2.6 kernel with hotplug.  There is a paper discussing it at:

Summary of user visible changes:
     * Implement NFS root support (TCP, UDP, v2), based on klibc code.
     * Added manual page.
     * Make debugging output and shell break-outs optional,
       triggered by kernel option 'ydebug'.
     * Minor template simplifications.
     * Merge klibc-1.0.14 changes.
     * A Debian package is available (Based on work by Steven Ihde)
