Sparse with my multi-context patch will continue to parse versions of
the kernel without this kernel patch, since I made the context
expression optional in sparse.  Versions of sparse without my
multi-context patch will not parse kernels with this kernel patch (since
previous versions of sparse will not support the extra argument).  The
same dependency relationship has held true with past additions to sparse
and the kernel; furthermore, that dependency relationship often exists
anyway due to the use of new GCC extensions in the kernel which require
changes to the sparse parser, such as __builtin_types_compatible_p,
__builtin_extract_return_addr, __builtin_va_copy, and
__attribute__((no_instrument_function)).
