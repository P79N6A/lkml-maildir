  [PNP] Locking Fixes
  
  The semaphore in pnp_init_resource_table is not needed and, in some
  cases, can cause resource management lockups.  This patch removes the
  improperly placed semaphore.

  [PNP] pnp_init_resource_table compile fix
  
  In the last release, this api was accidently changed and therefore 
  affected some drivers.  This patch corrects the issue by renaming
  the api back to pnp_init_resource_table.
