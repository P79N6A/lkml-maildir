Can we get you to agree that basically all subpage objects are immovable?
And as a consequence that garbage collecting at subpage levels doesn't
guarantee freeing up any pages that can then be given up to other
subsystems in response to VM pressure? The GC must think in terms of pages
to actually make progress.
One of the design goals of slab by the way is that objects of a similar
type will end up having similar lifetimes, avoiding some of the worst
cases of sub-page allocations.
