   I like to assign address like unicast (using ioctl and rtnetlink 
   (RTN_ANYCAST)).
   We suggest you not exporting this facilicy until finishing new API
   (And, another API would be standardized;
   This is another reason why I am against exporting that API for now.)
I think anycast addresses are more like multicast than unicast.  Do
you agree about this?
But here is what really matters, does the advanced IPV6 socket API
say anything about a user API for anycast?
