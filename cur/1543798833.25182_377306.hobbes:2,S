Well, the one thing that is preventing this is the fact that interrupts
don't call up and down, since down can schedule.  Now they might do a
down_trylock, but then if it would succeed, it would most likely call the
up. So the semaphore would be back to what it was before the interrupt
took place.
But you do have a case about preemption.
