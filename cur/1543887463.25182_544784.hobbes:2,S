A sort of race condition ;-)
I posted this as an RFC when one of the last 2.6.21-rc's came out, that is 
timerstats wasn't ABI yet, anticipating that I was late anyway.

It would be similar for other kernel code I have looked at.
And I think there would be an advantage if one was able to understand device 
driver A's statistics code immediately because it was written against some 
common library functions.
But it isn't easy to get this interface into the kernel by finding users.
I have got to "intercept" candidates before they add some own ABI to proc or 
whereever, while I can't change established statistics.
In short, if you would like to help in this case, I would appreciate it.

Almost. Though, there might be ways to keep the old format totally unchanged.
It would be a matter of stretching the concepts of a unified user interface for 
statistics.
Currently, my format comes with a substring representing <statistics name> 
<basket> preceding each line, which currently reads "expired - " plus the line 
powertop is familiar with.
Would it be feasible to to teach powertop to skip the first two elements?
