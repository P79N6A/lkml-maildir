Just a compile failure not inherently broken!
Add:
#include <linux/highmem.h> to the top of linux/mm.h and it should  
compile just fine.
Although it may cause a problem as highmem.h also includes mm.h so a  
bit of trickery may be needed to get it to compile...
I suspect that is_vmalloc_addr() should not be in linux/mm.h at all  
and should be in linux/vmalloc.h instead and vmalloc.h should include  
linux/highmem.h.  That would be more sensible than sticking a vmalloc  
related function into linux/mm.h where it does not belong...
Best regards,
