I would also appreciate the return of good resolution.  Blocky mouse 
startup moves make graphic editing rather difficult.  No mouse movement 
until I have moved my finger a significant distance then the mouse all 
of a sudden jumps a dozen pixels before it "smoothly" glides along.
I would also love to see the sync issues go away. :/  Whatever this 
patch(es) was supposed to accomplish, it introduced some rather 
undesirable side effects.  a) sync issues, b) tapping, c) fine grain 
movements, d) loss of scroll sliding as well (moving your finger along 
the side/bottom of the glidepoint).
Not griping, just providing feedback.
