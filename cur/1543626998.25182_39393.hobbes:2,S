Heh, no it's not in development.  Sorry for giving you such a short
answer, but it was a short question, with a lot of needed information
missing :)
Your distro should have set up all of the /dev nodes properly.  If you
are using an old distro version (as I am guessing you are) you will have
to set up the missing /dev entries by hand.

All of the numbers are documented in the Documentation/devices.txt
file.  The Linux USB Guide at 
http://www.linux-usb.org/
 also has info on
how to create the needed USB device entries if you're interested.
Good luck,
