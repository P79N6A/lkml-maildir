I think the fs driver layer might be the wrong thing too; maybe it'd be
best to do the CRC and/or checksumming at the block layer?
At the very least, I see a lack of genericity with respect to making it a
plugin to a specific fs. I'm going to try not to delve too far into
specifics, as my knowledge in these areas is limited, but I'd welcome any
corrections of misunderstandings I might have about feasibility, value,
or importance of these things, and even techhical misconceptions.
Jens, I apologize if advance if this is just another lame flamewar best
bitbucketed as opposed to answered.
Thanks.
