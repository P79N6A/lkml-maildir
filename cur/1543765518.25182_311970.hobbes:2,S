So the only remaining case is where an attacker can read the random
seed file before boot but can't install any trojans.  Which seems
like an awfully small case.  (Although in some scenarios, passive
attacks are much easier to mount than active ones.)

Yes, I know.  Fortuna's claim to fame is that it tries to achieve that
without explicitly measuring entropy.

I'm not a big fan of Fortuna either, but the issues are separate.
I agree that trusting crypto prmitives that you don't have to is a bad
idea.  If my application depends on SHA1 being secure, then I might as
well go ahead and use SHA1 in my PRNG.  But a kernel service doesn't
know what applications are relying on.
(Speaking of which, perhaps it's time, in light of the breaking of MD5,
to revisit the cut-down MD4 routine used in the TCP ISN selection?
I haven't read the MD5 & SHA1 papers in enough detail to understand the
flaw, but perhaps some defenses could be erected?)
But still, all else being equal, an RNG resistant to a state extension
attack *is* preferable to one that's not.  And the catastrophic
reseeding support in /dev/random provides exactly that feature.
What Fortuna tries to do is sidestep the hard problem of entropy
measurement.  And that's very admirable.  It's a very hard thing to do in
general, and the current technique of heuristics plus a lot of derating
is merely adequate.
If a technique could be developed that didn't need an accurate entropy
measurement, then things would be much better.

Just to be clear, I don't remember it ever throwing entropy away, but
it hoards some for years, thereby making it effectively unavailable.
Any catastrophic reseeding solution has to hold back entropy for some
time.
And I think that, even in the absence of special-purpose RNG hardware,
synchronization jitter on modern GHz+ CPUs is a fruitful source of
entropy.
