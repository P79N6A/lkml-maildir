There are filesystems around (MSDOS, VFAT) that haven't got fixed inode
numbers for files. There are networked filesystems where this would need
radical changes to the server side. Some even make up inode numbers on the
fly IIRC.
If in dire need, you could hack something together for <favorite
filesystem> by groveling over the disk image. e2fsprogs' libraries should
come handy...
