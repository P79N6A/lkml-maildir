What's an "iproute"?  Is that anything like "ip route", which a few people
have been telling us to use?  I just looked in my 2.2.1 tree, and the only
mention I find of "iproute" is in networking/policy-routing.txt (which
likely isn't read by anybody not interested in policy routing) and
routing.txt, which says nothing about route being broken or deprecated.
Maybe this is why so many people are confused.
