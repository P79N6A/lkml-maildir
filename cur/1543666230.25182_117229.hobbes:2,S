I'm having the same problem with 2.5.64 (haven't tried another dev kernel 
yet). The system boots, prints the
'Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel.'
message and then locks up. After 2-3 seconds the capslock led turns off and 
then the system is totally locked, requiring a press of the reset button to 
reset the system (CTRL-ALT-DEL doesn't work). SysRq doesn't work either.
My system specs:
- AthlonXP 1700
- VIA KT266A chipset / 512Mb DDR ram
- normal keyboard (no USB) and PS/2 mouse
- GeForce4 Ti4600 videocard (kernel not compiled with framebuffer)
- 3 IDE UDMA harddisks, 1 IDE CD-RW attached
