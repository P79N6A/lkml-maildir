I have said nothing about sleeping in interrupt or softirq context.
First, one has to make kmap fallible. Second, ensure that it does not
fail often. This can be done by creating a page table pool, where kmap
can allocate page tables from, when all of the remaining page tables are
full. The mempool is of course refilled at the next occasion.
For stuff, that cannot be allowed to fail, kmap_atomic is still there.
