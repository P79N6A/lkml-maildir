Davide,
from what I understand, Marc is not asking for the code above to remove
the fd from the epoll set, but he's in fact complaining that he *observed*
that the fd was removed from the epoll set in the *parent* process when
the child closes it, which is of course not expected at all. As strange
as it looks like, this might need investigation. It is possible that there
is some strange bug somewhere in some kernel versions.
Marc, I think that if you indicate the last kernel version on which you
observed this and provide a very short and easy reproducer, it would
help everyone investigating this. Basically something which reports "OK"
or "KO".
Regards,
Willy
