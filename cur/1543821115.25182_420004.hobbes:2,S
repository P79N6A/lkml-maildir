Once register_cpu_notifier is placed in an init section, everything should
be okay.  If some other module does _exactly_ what xfs did, it won't oops
-- instead the module will get an unresolved symbol error whenever someone
tries to insmod it, because the register_cpu_notifier symbol won't be
defined.  I think this is an appropriate kind of failure mode.
However, it wouldn't hurt to add some comments to the definition and 
declaration of register_cpu_notifier, explaining the circumstances in 
which it should be used.
