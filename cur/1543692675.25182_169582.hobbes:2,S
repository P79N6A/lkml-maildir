Mousedev can only be compiled as a module if you've said yes to "Remove 
Kernel Features" from the General Setup screen (usually used for lightweight 
embedded kernels.)   Otherwise it's always compiled straight in.

Hmm.  Well, I think I'll give it a go and see what I can get working; I'll 
probably want to use the pen/eraser stuff properly at some point.  Although 
I'm not drawing much any more, they do come in handy sometimes.  I'll get 
back to you after I've had a bit of a play.
