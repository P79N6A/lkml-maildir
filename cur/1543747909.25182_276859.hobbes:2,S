So you gonna call virt_to_bus several times (for each page) and see 
whether you get new phys page or not? This could work, but for the 
common case of phys-continuous buffer it'll be suboptimal, i.e. you 
waste time calling virt_to_bus when it's not needed. TO make it better 
you have to move that range check from virt_to_bus and friends to your 
DMA library, in this case we end up in the same situation we are 
already :) - no need to modify virt_to_bus....
