I think the following flushing policy would work almost as well, while
remaining generic:
 - if there's a read that is not handled from the buffer cache, flush
   (write) all dirty buffers
 - if we need to flush (write) one dirty buffers, flush all others too
This wouldn't catch cases like an explicit spin-up without data I/O,
but I don't think this is much of a problem in real life.
