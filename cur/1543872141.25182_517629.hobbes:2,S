Right - We both agree - And setting console=/dev/null in the bootargs still 
does not help.
When the kernel initializes the UART Port, it asserts RTS - which confuses the 
host it is attached to (in this case, the Linux system is the serial 
peripheral).
How about adding a module_param to serial core, which the default is to assert 
RTS (as is today), and someone (like me) can override with serial_core.RTS=0
