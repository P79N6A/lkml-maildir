But those are not the same spinning mutexes. Chris wrote his mail on Jan 
05, Peter his first mail about spin-mutexes on Jan 06, as a reaction to 
Chris's mail.
My reply links back the discussion to the original analysis from Chris 
pointing out that it would be nice to try BTRFS with plain mutexes plus 
Peter's patch - instead of throwing away BTRFS's locking design or 
anything intrusive like that.
Where's the problem? :)
