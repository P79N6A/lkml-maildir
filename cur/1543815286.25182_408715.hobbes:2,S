what DMA problem? ive always used via chipsets with usb. now the 8237. 
the via pci-busmaster dma hangs the system? try setting pci latency to 64.
most bioses initialize with 32. this had been a known problem, for me too.
this has been left out of the discussion at via forums.
and what knows a usb controller about MPEG? thats another layer.
so a bios fixes this and other os have no problem with this, 
so its fixable by software. then do it now, pls.
and stop this "blacklisting habit", all these nowadays chips are designed-to-cost 
"consumer crap" somewhow.
or do you want linux-usb to be blacklisted as "broken" by the manufacturers blacklists? ;)
