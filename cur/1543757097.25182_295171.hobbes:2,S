I can confirm that. Creating a correct  iso image from a CD is a
major pain w/o ide-scsi. Depending on what one has done before the iso
image is missing some data at the end most of the time.
(paired with lots of kernel error messages)
Testing was done here using Joerg Schilling's sdd:
sdd ivsize=`isosize /dev/cdxxx` if=/dev/cdxxx of=/dev/null \
	bs=<several block sizes from 2048 up tried,does not matter>
and most of the time it results in bad iso images....
