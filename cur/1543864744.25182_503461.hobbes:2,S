I think I recall hearing about hald breaking in rhel4 with modern
kernels here on this list, some time before I built a custom kernel
for that rig (Athlon 64 3200+ on Asus A8V w' VIA K8T800Pro chipset
running 32 bit RHEL 4 ES). I was expecting it to happen. I think at
the time, the current kernel was 2.6.15.2 or thereabouts.
However, I haven't upgraded any software that's in the distro packages
beyond what up2date provides, so:
$ rpm -qa | grep hal
hal-0.4.2-4.EL4
So sorry about that, I didn't mean to take up any of your time. I
only mentioned it incidentally and wasn't expecting it to be
addressed. (I was more happily stating that nothing of significance
to me is broken in the distro). If that was something I needed, I
would have looked into upgrading it.
