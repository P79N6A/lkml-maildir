Oops.  You're right; I didn't think of this.
So, I guess the best short-term solution is to fix the C library so it
always uses llseek for directories and never tries something stupid
like a SEEK_CUR.  Then, at least it'll always work for NFSv2.  I'll
file a bug report.
At the same time, a patch for CFS to use "small" (from a little-endian
perspective) cookies couldn't hurt, so I'll do that, too.
Thanks for the help.
