Let me expand a bit on that. 
You can hook a non-conforming modem/whatever to a PBX. As long as it
works, that's fine. If it doesn't, it's your problem.
The Netherlands only cares about Dutch conformance. So you're
perfectly allowed to sell an international traveller kit that doesn't
conform in the UK. Now that we're both EU, things might start moving
towards the one conformance test and one approval, but we still won't
care wether a modem blows up the exchange in the USA....
