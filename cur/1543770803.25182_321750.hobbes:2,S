Subject: [2.4 patch] document that gcc 4 is not supported
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

gcc 4 is not supported for compiling kernel 2.4, and I don't see any 
compelling reason why kernel 2.4 should ever be adapted to gcc 4.
This patch documents this fact.
