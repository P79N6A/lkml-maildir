Subject: [PATCH 2.6.9] Fix menuconfig on Solaris
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Something occured to me after I sent my first round of Solaris patches,
people might want to use 'menuconfig' not just config/oldconfig.  The
following two bits are needed to get it working (not as colorful as on
Linux, but it functions) for me.  First, unless CURS_MACROS is defined,
scroll(x) doesn't get expanded to wscrl(x, 1).  I did some quick
grepping on Cygwin and Linux (debian/unstable) and didn't see
CURS_MACROS show up anywhere else, but to be safe I put it inside of
__sun__.  Next this uses libcurses instead of libncurses otherwise we
get a bunch of undefined refs to w32attrset, w32addch, acs32map and few
more.
