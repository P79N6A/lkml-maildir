What you're describing is not microcode in the traditional sense. 
Traditionally, microcode is a program store in the processor, and 
machine instructions cause the CPU to start executing micro instructions 
from that program store.  The Pentium 4 doesn't operate that way.
On the other hand, it would make sense to have some of the instruction 
decode being done using lookup tables, but the complexity of the x86 
instruction set is such that it can't all be done that way.
