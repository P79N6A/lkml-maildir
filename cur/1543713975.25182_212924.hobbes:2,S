I completely agree with you on that. Security is not
only technical issues. I was an owner of the company
when our server was hacked, so I did all explanations
for down time with our customers. (Downtime was
significant - server was collocated in another country
and it took quite a while for reinstall Linux -
different time zone, nobody on 24x7 duty...).
Advice to apply all new patches is good, one should do
that. But there are problems:
1. One should monitor patch development constantly and
be paid for that job (additional expenses).
2. Will be patch available in time and would it be
possible to find it - there are questions.
3. Some patches are created after security hole was
exploited. I don't want to be among these first sites
:-)
So, even if you patched everything - there are
security holes anyway (patches will be developed in
the future). If it is not production server - not a
big deal. If it is production - downtimes should be
minimal and stealing of sensitive information is
unacceptable. If kernel is slow - I'll buy faster
hardware with SMP if needed - it's not an issue at
all. Not enough - I'll install cluster, but I can't
allow system to be compromised.
Serge.
