I haven't been following the whole thread, but it is _possible_ that the
email data was written to the end of a data block which was later re-used
for a file exported via SMB.  Depending on how the SMB code works, is it
possible that it is sending a whole block of data to the client and/or
not zeroing out new blocks?
Of course (not having looked at the original tcpdump output), is it
possible that the email was captured by tcpdump because it arrived on
the host via the network?
Cheers, Andreas
