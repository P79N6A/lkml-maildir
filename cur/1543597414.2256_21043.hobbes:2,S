Yeah, however nobody tried to implement SCC command class before.
It is much easier for a controller vendor to provide REPORT_LUNS
(which is enough to find volumes), and have some out-of-band
management interface - front panel, telnet, or a web form.
Out of curiousity, what is your hardware?
The patch looks ok.
