you are missing the point.
as stated before: embedded systems use the smallest, most efficient, most
inexpensive chip that is up to the job.
8bit chips are still used all over the place. And even in 38 years time,
there will be plenty of tasks that can be done with a 32bit chip and a
lightweight unix-like OS.
Why would you use a 64 bit chip if a 32bit would do the job? 
The 64 bit chip is bigger, so your device has to be bigger.
It will need a lot more power, so your device has to be bigger, needs more
expensive batteries, needs (a larger quantity of) and/or (more expensive)
ancillary components.. etc.. 
And finally, the 64 bit chip will itself cost a lot more than the 32 bit
one.
It's extra cost on top of extra cost on top of extra cost.
Granted there will be plenty of uses for 64bit chips in the future, but
there will also be plenty of tasks suitable for 32bit chips...
