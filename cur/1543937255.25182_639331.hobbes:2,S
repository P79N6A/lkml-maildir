Subject: [PATCH] Deprecate checkpatch.pl --file mode; add warning; add --file-force
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/16/354

I'm not entirely sure who collects checkpatch patches for .25 -- i thought it
was Andy W., but he doesn't seem to answer. Anyways whoever does it please
queue this patch for the next checkpatch.pl update. Or perhaps it could
be put into -mm?
Thanks,
-Andi

Deprecate checkpatch.pl --file mode; add warning; add --file-force
As discussed on linux-kernel checkpatch.pl only patches for whole
files have a significant cost. Better such changes should be only
done together with other changes. Add a explicit warning about
this; deprecate --file and add a --file-force instead.
