Hi,
I'm going to bring my device drivers[1] from 2.4 to 2.6 and have successfully 
installed kernel-2.6.5 for my athlon-PC.
Compiling (unmodified) 2.4-sources of my modules stops, missing irq_vectors.h.
What do I have to do to successfully include <linux/interrupt.h> from inside a 
kernel module? Or is ther a completely different strategy for ISRs in 2.6? 
(Where is the starting point to read, in this case?)
FYI:
$ uname -r
2.6.5
$ gcc -c -Wall -I/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ 
-DHARMONIE_DEBUG harmonie_io.c
In file included from /lib/modules/2.6.5/build/include/linux/irq.h:20,
                 from /lib/modules/2.6.5/build/include/asm/hardirq.h:6,
                 from /lib/modules/2.6.5/build/include/linux/interrupt.h:11,
                 from harmonie_io.c:44:
/lib/modules/2.6.5/build/include/asm/irq.h:16:25: irq_vectors.h: No such file 
or directory
