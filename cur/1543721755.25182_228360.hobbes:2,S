Every time I run mrtg (which uses snmp), I see al lot of these messages 
in my kernel logs (running kernel 2.6.7)
Jun 18 20:19:28 localhost Bridge does not support ioctl 0x8947
This didn't happen under 2.6.6. I tried upgrading net-snmp to version 
5.1.1, but that didn't help.
Everything seems to work ok, though, including snmp.
Cheers,
Michael
