ah, i completely missed that! Thanks :-)
this changes the picture completely and makes the IO-APIC/local-APIC hw 
retrigger code/logic the main suspect. I think you right that it's quite 
bogus to hw-retrigger level irqs, and that could be confusing the 
IO-APIC (or the local APIC, or both).
and i think i see why my first sw-resend patch didnt do the trick:

we used the hw-resend method unconditionally, right?
