You can deal with all that in one single port.  See the MIPS port which is
running on a wide number of big and little endian targets.  The effective
number of places where this needs to be considered is quite small.
User applications are somewhat worse because there is alot of code which
does not differenciate between the processor architecture and the
architecture of a machine around it, therefore make wrong conclusions like
``It's a MIPS, therefore it's big endian'' - just because RISC/os, IRIX,
SINIX etc.  are big endian.

Those who know have signed NDAs ...
