How does that work?  module.c does the register/deregister on behalf of the
module?
I certainly encourage people to disagreee with me here, but my current
thinking is:
- the cleanup aspect isn't worth the runtime overhead and
- the support-modular-users aspect is largely new and would need a lot
  more description and justification (with examples) before we can even
  begin to evaluate it.
