Looping five times before giving up seems arbitrary and failure-prone
on busy systems.
Is msleep_interruptible (as opposed to msleep) really appropriate?
Hope all the callers of this function are in non-atomic context (but I
wasn't able to find any callers?).
And this function is too big to be inline.
