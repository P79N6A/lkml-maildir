Adam mentioned earlier, and I agree, that it is probably a bad
idea for this code to blindly scribble on the BIST field at i=3.
Probably we should clear that field before restoring it.
Re: this patch
I think that this patch is likely a positive forward step.
It seems logical to restore the BARs before the CMD/STATUS in general,
nothing specific to the ICH here.
But yes, this is a helper routine and devices where it hurts
instead of helps should have their own routine.  Complex devices
need to handle the device-specific config space state above these
1st 16 locations anyway.
