The 2.6.27 series have been out for a while, so it's not a common bug
you have hit and something must be special in your case. Perhaps its
your config, but it's impossible to pinpoint anything from your
description above.
It sounds like that you could use git-bisect(1) to tell you which commit
it started not working from. According to your description above I'd say
you would want to start with
git bisect start
git bisect good v2.6.26
git bisect bad v2.6.27
and git will respond with something like
Bisecting: 5685 revisions left to test after this
[dd9ca5d9be7eba99d685d733e23d5be7110e9556] USB: usb-serial: fix a sparse
warning about different signedness
Then you'd make, install and test the kernel for this revision and
determine whether it was good or bad and get the next revision by
stating 'git bisect good/bad'. You'd have to repeat this about 13 times.

Don't set that. The help text for this option warned you:
  Choose this option if you want kernel modesetting enabled by default,
  and you have a new enough userspace to support this. Running old
  userspaces with this enabled will cause pain.  Note that this causes
  the driver to bind to PCI devices, which precludes loading things like
  intelfb.

Yeah, see [1].

P.S. Please set a subject for your emails, and make it something more
descriptive than the one I provided if possible.
