The behaviour is random unless you define a new si_code number or fix
SI_FROMUSER, see the queued SIGIO bug report thread you conveniently 
ignored a few days ago.
The problem is that the !SI_FROMUSER check in bad_signal() does not work
properly, because SI_FROMUSER does not match the defined SI_* codes (it returns
true for kernel generated signals). The result is that it always looks at
current and what happens depends on the credentials of the current process
(= random)
