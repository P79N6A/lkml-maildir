First, regardless of any real or imagined "partisan attitudes" I have
yet to see a good implementation of a good idea rejected.
Second, and more importantly, having 'redhat.com' (or mandrakesoft.com
that for matter) in your e-mail address does not automatically imply
that that 'helping Jeff Merkey' is included in the job description. 
Many kernel hackers (a) do what they want, and (b) have friggin' HUGE
mailboxes.
If you have a specific technical issue, I am sure we are more than happy
to discuss it in public on lkml.  Sure maintainers are sometimes slow to
respond, or don't respond at all.  Just keep trying, and keep civil
about it.
So chill out...  the harder you push, the more doors you are closing for
yourself.
Regards,
	Jeff
