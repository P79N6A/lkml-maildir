oops, forgot to do the last step - should be fixed now.

ok, i'll try that too - there should be nothing particularly special 
about glxgears.
there's another tweak you could try:
	echo 500000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_granularity_ns
note that this causes preemption to be done as fast as the scheduler can 
do it. (in practice it will be mainly driven by CONFIG_HZ, so to get the 
best results a CONFIG_HZ of 1000 is useful.)
plus there's an add-on to CFS at:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/cfs-scheduler/sched-fair-hog.patch
this makes the 'CPU usage history cutoff' configurable and sets it to a 
default of 100 msecs. This means that CPU hogs (tasks which actively 
kept other tasks from running) will be remembered, for up to 100 msecs 
of their 'hogness'.
Setting this limit back to 0 gives the 'vanilla' CFS scheduler's 
behavior:
     echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_max_hog_history_ns
(So when trying this you dont have to reboot with this patch 
applied/unapplied, just set this value.)

cool, thanks!
