Given that such behavior implies some raciness in userspace, you'd
probably need either malicious or buggy user code to trigger it, and
in the latter case, you're limited to apps using threads.  Thus, it's
probably not that surprising that it hasn't been seen.
It could also happen in other rare cases, such as if the page gets
swapped out, and you get an I/O error swapping it back in, or if
forced filesystem unmounting were implemented.
