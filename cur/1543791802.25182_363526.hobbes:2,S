Yep, right for your case... however currently the majority of users use tmpfs 
(I hope for them)...

See lwn.net last issue (when it becomes available) on this issue. In short, 
however, the real point is that we need this kind of support.

I'm aware of this possibility, and I've said in fact "Frag. avoidance will be 
nice to use". However I'm not sure that the system call overhead is so big, 
compared to flushing the TLB entries...
But for now we haven't the issue - you don't do hotunplug frequently. When 
somebody will write the auto-hotunplug management daemon we could have a 
problem on this...

Jeff's trick is call the buddy allocator (__get_free_pages()) to get a full 
page (and it will do any needed work to free memory), so nobody else will use 
it, and then madvise() it.
If a better API exists, that will be used.

I couldn't parse your sentence. The allocation will free memory like when 
memory is needed.
However look at /proc/sys/vm/swappiness or use Con Kolivas's patches to find 
new tunable and policies.
