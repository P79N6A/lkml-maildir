Hi!
thanx for your (and others) help, it's now clear to me.
My problem was not the mixup with 'pre9'/'final' and 'final'/''
but with directory sorting! I always looked at the bottom of the
directory for new patches and therefore missed the '-final' file
as it is somewhere in the middle...
As someone wrote, 
'Linus was a bit distracted when he came up with that lot'
and,
'ARGH.'
Have fun,
Florian
