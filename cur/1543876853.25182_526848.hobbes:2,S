Sparc does the same thing, it's a common convention and you really
should not break it.
Every powerpc and sparc system out that is using ttyS0 with dynamic
minor numbers being allocated.  I really think this should be
generalized instead of breaking serial on every powerpc machine out
there.  (sparc won't be broken because we have our own copy of
the 8250 driver that does ttyS? minor allocations and keyboard/
mouse serio hookups properly).
