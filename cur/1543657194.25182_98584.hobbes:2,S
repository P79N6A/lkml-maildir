It got merged because no-one was testing it when supplied in its current form 
outside the 2.5 tree and because no-one was fixing the older incarnation of 
this driver that was in the tree.  Including it was a caclulated risk 
mitigated significantly because we still have a maintained aic7xxx_old driver.
So far, the only bug report I have is from Andrew Morton proving that it still 
doesn't get it's bounce buffers right.
I assume all your bug reports are on their way to linux-scsi?
