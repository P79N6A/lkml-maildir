Hello!
> semantics of snd_sml), maybe it makes the difference but then I don't see how.
It makes. One small packet is allowed to fly, not depending on packets_out.
This is idea of Minshall.
"Classic" Nagle also does not prohibit this, but it is difficult
to formulate it in terms of presegmented queue, used in linux,
so that we preferred Minshall's approach.
Third algo, used by linux-2.2: "queue as soon as packet is small
and packets_out!=0" is _not_ Nagle's one, it is surely wrong.
