A young lady in Ireland has developed a cryptographic algorithm that
at first look provides significantly better speed than RSA.  She is
thinking of releasing the algorithm under open source.  The article
seems relevant to the kernel due to the recent discussions of
cryptographic hooks.  An open source algorithm would be well accepted
by many users of Linux.
