Can't you just memory-map the area you need? That reserves it
until it's unmapped. You don't need to directly touch the TLB.
If you need a physical location, use ioremap_nocache() in your
driver. If you can't get your physical location because the
kernel already uses it, boot the kernel with mem=xxx on the
command-line to prevent the kernel from using memory you
want to reserve for your DSP. You can use num_physpages
(an integer) to find out the last page the kernel uses.
BTW, if this is a new design, most DSP devices put their
RAM on their own board so you don't have these problems.
That RAM gets mmaped to user-space as needed for access,
that address being set asside in PCI space.
