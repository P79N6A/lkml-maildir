I think you misunderstood our experiment. In fact, we were trying to
generate as much possible different singletons on the domain (each of
our rule was the header of a packet which have not been seen before),
because if we can group these rules into intervals, then our scheme is
having some advantages.
We were using IDD (Interval Decision Diagrams) which is a kind of
extended BDD (Binary Decision Diagrams) where you take your decision by
looking at a partition of the possible values of the variable. For
example, looking at the value x in [0,1024] where [0,128] leads to one
node in the decision tree, [129,256] to another and [257,1024] to a last
one. More this partition is fragmented more you increase the size of the
structure. Having a lot of overlap does certainly increase the number of
partitions, but adding singletons is the simplest way to increase the
number of partitions.
Take a look at this paper, maybe you can get some idea for your scheme
(it might be that some hybrid between your ideas and ours can make it):

I'm always happy to see a firm funding some Open Source project. So, I
can do anything else but wishing you good luck for the future. :)

Good. :)
