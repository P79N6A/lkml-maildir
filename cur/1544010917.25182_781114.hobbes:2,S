Nick,
fuse and reiser4 still use __grab_cache_page() although your patch
removed it:
build-r7257.out:/local/linsrc/tmp/mmotm-2008-1216-0043/fs/reiser4/plugin/file/file_conversi
on.c:689: error: implicit declaration of function '__grab_cache_page'
build-r7257.out:make[3]: *** [fs/reiser4/plugin/file/file_conversion.o] Error 1
build-r7248.out:/local/linsrc/tmp/mmotm-2008-1216-0043/fs/fuse/file.c:792: error: implicit declaration of function '__grab_cache_page'
build-r7248.out:make[3]: *** [fs/fuse/file.o] Error 1
