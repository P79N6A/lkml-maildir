The usermode agent (watchdog(8) can, btw monitor the availableness of a
file, no need to write a module. MAybe this feature was added after somebody
took that code over from you? :)
watchdog.conf(5) says: 
#     file = <filename> Set file name for file mode.  This option can be
#              given as often as you like to check several files.
