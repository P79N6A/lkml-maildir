Thank you very much for your answer, I have tried the bk -r get, but I
didn't get the 2.5.70 in the Makefile...
I am a little bit lost with bk. Finally I tried:
bk pull
bk -r co
And then I got the 2.5.70 and it still compiling it ;-)
(the xfs stuff is passed).
Sorry for the complete off-topic: I use DVB, and most of the time, the
one included in the kernel is outdated and I took the one from
cvs -q -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@linuxtv.org:/cvs/linuxtv co dvb-kernel
and the dvb-kernel/makelinks replace some files from the kernel with
symlinks: could I then use bk to update after?
An hudge thank,
	Grégoire
