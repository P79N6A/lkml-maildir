Hi!
I had to remove "static" from the agp_init-function in
drivers/char/agp/backend.c to get the kernel to link (when building
Intel 810 Framebuffer into the kernel).
I also got unresolved symbols for two modules.
arch/i386/kernel/suspend.ko: enable_sep_cpu, default_ldt, init_tss
arch/i386/kernel/apm.ko: save_processor_state, restore_processor_state
Regards,
Andreas Henriksson
