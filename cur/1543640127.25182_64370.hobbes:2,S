A 4G/4G split will perform _so_ badly that it isn't even funny (it's also
technically impossible since you have to have some shared area anyway, but
you can get pretty close to it).
My bet is that we'll never do it due to performance issues. It's just 
simpler to make the high pages end up being some special stuff (ie the old 
"swap victim cache" etc that wouldn't show up to the VM proper).
