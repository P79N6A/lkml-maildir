Done, no change.
Got some articles, restarted the server, all is good.
Got other articles, rebooted and the files now differ.
And I have another problem: I'm experiencing random hangs using X[1] with
2.4.0-test12. After a variable amount of time, some of the times I use X
(I mostly use console) it just freezes hard (no caps lock activity).
I'm not sure if this only happens while using X or it's just less
frequent in console. -test9 works fine and I used it since it has been
released with no ill effects.
