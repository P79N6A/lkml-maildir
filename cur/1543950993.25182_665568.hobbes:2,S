I don't recall this, but from looking at the source it seems that only 
part of my patch made it upstream for some reason ... 
Bruno, does the patch below remove the warning for you? (we should rather 
used lockdep_set_class() now, when this is already available ... it wasn't 
in the time I was doping the original patch back in 2006).
Set locking depth properly (level == 0 for DVB frontend, level == 1 for 
DVB adapter).
