The patch corrects the messages about shared interrupts:
pccard: PCMCIA card inserted into slot 0

I have lost the connector cable that attaches the card to an ethernet
cable, so I have been using a cable labelled 3COM instead.  It has
LEDs for 10 and 100 Kbps connections.
Neither LED is lighting up.  On the other hand, NetworkManager
seems aware when I have an ethernet cable attached.  I now
suspect that I need a new cable.  The card is a D-Link DFE-650
Fast Ethernet PCMCIA adapter.  Maybe I should order one of these:
