CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL is way to coarse. I always need to turn it on and
then it loses any value.
Why not encode the drivers status into the driver name so that is is
obvious when you are configuring the kernel?
Like this for a driver name:
   Compaq Smart Array 5xxx support (experimental)
Some drivers are already do this:
   Micro Memory MM5415 Battery Backed RAM support (EXPERIMENTAL)
Now the status is obvious on an item by item basis.
