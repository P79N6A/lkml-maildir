All naming policies are moving to userspace.  It will not be a kernel
issue.

No, we need the major/minor number to be in driverfs.  That way the
userspace program (that's running the naming policy) can look at
driverfs to see what devices are present, what the major/minor number of
the device is, what type of device it is, and then create the /dev node
for the device, based on that information.
We are slowly getting there, and I don't see any intermediate steps
along the way (meaning ones that get ripped out later.)
