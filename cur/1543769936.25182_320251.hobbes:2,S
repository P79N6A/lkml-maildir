I don't know of x86-64, but atleast on x86 ipi broadcast will send 
to _all_ CPUs present, right? I mean the h/w does not know of the offline
CPUs and will send to them also. This could lead to a problem for the offline 
CPUs when they come online and can take a spurious IPI (unless
there is support in h/w to clear pending IPI before doing STI).

I think this should be the recommended approach (using send_IPI_mask if 
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is defined) unless h/w is intelligent enough 
that it avoids sending IPIs to offline CPUs or it supports clearing 
pending interrupts.
