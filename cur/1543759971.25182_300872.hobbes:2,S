  Isn't also the following scenario dangerous?
  __journal_unfile_buffer(jh);
  journal_remove_journal_head(bh);
  If journal_unmap_buffer() decides to destroy the buffer before we call
journal_remove_journal_head(), we get an assertion failure in
__journal_remove_journal_head()...
  I believe the right fix really is that anyone having a pointer to
bh/jh should hold a reference counted in b_jcount - so basically the
idea Andrew proposed. 
  It could work like follows: When you first create jh you get a
reference in b_jcount (that is already happening). If you file a jh in
some transaction list, you will 'delegate' this reference to the
transaction and hence you won't do journal_put_journal_head() after
you're done. Now if you unfile a buffer from the list you 'get back' it's
reference (and you have to journal_put_journal_head() if you're not
going to file the buffer back again). The only thing you have to assure is
the proper list locking so that two different callers cannot 'get back' one
reference but that should be already done...
  This solution should be doable without additional locking or big code
changes but maybe the reference policy is a bit too complicated...
