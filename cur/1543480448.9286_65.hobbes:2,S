Hi,
I've updated my "spelling" patch, a collection of small changes to
documentation.  This revision has my attempts at having
Documentation/Changes mention Linux 2.2, and having the driver for the
Assassin 3D use the same spelling as the manufacturer's Web site
(
http://www.fpgaming.com/portfolio/assn3d.html
).
This one has not yet been tested in the sleep deprivation lab. :)  It's at
http://jpj.net/~trevor/linux/spelling-2.2.0-pre7.diff.bz2
 and is 203 518
bytes.
