Slackware 11 (2.6.18 kernel) didn't have GNOME installed. So if it is a GNOME thing, how come Slackware too was giving the same error? 
Also, if previously the kernel wasn't reporting errors when asked to do stuff like this with VCDs, how come it was still able to mount the VCDs and allow playback/ copying of the files in it? Its ok if the kernel reports more errors than before, as long as it allows playback/ copying ...

Your system tried to read a Video data block. The usual cure for this
problem is to remove Gnome, or at least kill all the Gnome stuff and flip
to init level 3 then mount the cd from the command line. 
The kernel is correctly reporting it was asked to do something stupid.
Older kernels would fail to report many of these errors due to a bug in
the ide-cd reporting logic.
