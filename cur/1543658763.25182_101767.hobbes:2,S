What about something like lmsensors?  Wouldn't the motherboard normally
report different temperatures for each cpu, since each has its own temp
diode?
(this originally was supposed to be a in-jest idea to run two threads and
see if one cpu or two cpu's heat up, but then i realized you might as well
just count the temperature diodes :D)
