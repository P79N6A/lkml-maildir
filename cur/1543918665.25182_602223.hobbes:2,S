Yes, I thought about that too. But I never seemed to need more than
two tries to make it fail.
So I would only suspect the last good step as wrong positive.
That would then point to the first of your maps2-patches, the moving
of the pagewalker code.
Would you thing that this is a plausible cause?

What backups? :-)
Yes, I also thought about hardware trouble, but the bisect result
seemed to consistent.
Also that its not always the same drive that fails, only every time
one of the sil-drives.
I now have activated ATA_DEBUG to see if the good and the bad boots differ.
It looks the same until the RAID5 starts.
Good boot:

the drive sda falls of the earth and can't be recovered through soft-
or hard-resetting the port by the error handler.
So I will use the weekend to see if I can find out who issues this
command and add more debug to that place...
