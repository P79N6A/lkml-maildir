Yeah, well, ...
Two years ago when I started all this, I was looking for a good name.
All I could come up with sounded stupid, so I picked "LogFS" as a code
name.  As soon as I find a better name, the code name should get
replaced.
By now I still don't have anything better.  All alternatives that were
proposed are just as bad - with the added disadvantage of being new and
not established yet.  My hope of ever finding a better name is nearly
zero.

Half-agreed.  For callers, the name "cookie" makes sense.  It is a
transparent thing they should not tough and hand back unchanged.  For
logfs_iget() and logfs_iput() something like "is_cached" would be
better.
Will change.
