I've been using the 2.6.17 series with "all-generic-ide irqpoll" on a
Gigabyte 965P-S3 motherboard [using the ICH8 chipset].
It worked semi decent [other than random interrupt 177 hehehe].
However, this morning I took the same .config and applied it to 2.6.18
with some nasties.  It compiled fine, the disks work now (my SATA
drives also show up as /dev/sd* finally) but now the sky2 device
disappeared.
lspci can still see it, it's a Marvell "Uknown Device 4364, rev 12"
sitting off the PCI-E bus.
Odd...
