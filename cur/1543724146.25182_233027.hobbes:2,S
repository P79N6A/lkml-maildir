IMHO, yes it may be better.

A table with coefficients taken from datasheet. They're used to
compute the core frequency according to XLB bus frequency and external
jumper configurations.

I suppose your question is why create bi_mbar_base instead of using immr.
Well, I guess that would work just fine. The structure is just taken 
straight from U-Boot sources.
If the question was if I really need to add fields for the frequency, 
then the answer is yes. (Else, I must measure them which takes times and 
is inherently less precise).
