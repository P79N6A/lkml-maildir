I've confirmed that my problem in the Promise driver is NOT related to
the HPT366 device.  I swapped the promise card (And the drives attached
to it) to another board, and it hung at the same step in the boot
process - right after finding the drive(s) on the system chipset's
controller, where it should then begin finding stuff on the Promise...
but it can't.
At this point I guess I'm down to waiting.  I don't want to be stuck
using it with the generic driver and thus getting hideous performance.
I've done everything that I know how to do; I'm not much of a coder
(especially not C).   If I thought I could fix it myself I'd try. :)
Hopefully someone becomes my savior before I start looking to *BSD for
an answer... I really don't want to lose all of the data on these drives
(XFS & LVM aren't supported anywhere else) and I have no easy way to
back them up.  That's the biggest thing keeping me on linux at the
moment.
I'll wait patiently now, I know that gurus musn't be pestered. ;)
