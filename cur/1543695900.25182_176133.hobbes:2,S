Hi all,
After switching from 2.4.22 to 2.6.0-test9, I have received reproducible
MCE non-fatal error check messages in my kernel log.  (For example, one
shows up right after my first scsi card init).
From Dave Jones' patch here:
http://lists.insecure.org/lists/linux-kernel/2003/Sep/7362.html
and another message here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/10/7/214
would seem to imply that Athlons don't like having their Bank 0 poked at,
though that's what non-fatal.c does.  Would it be correct to make sure
that that non-fatal.c starts at bank 1, if it is an Athlon?
Dave, is the following patch correct?  Booted and tested, no ill effects
so far ...
