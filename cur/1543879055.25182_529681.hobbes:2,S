That's fine.  I just use the futex key lookup code to get a unique key
for shared memory between lguests (this is how lg.ko decides if they can
send DMA & interrupts to each other).
Looks like Andrew has already patched the lguest callers (I resubmitted
the moved lguest code just today).
Thanks!
Rusty.
PS.  As original futex author, I could have been cc'd on these patches
anyway.  But since the futex code has become unforgivably ugly (but, oh
so fast for pthreads), it's probably better not to see them 8)
