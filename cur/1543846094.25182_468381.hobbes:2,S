when unlimited is true, this means ubr.  alloc_shaper() creates a queue
to use for all ubr (best effort) traffic.  ubr doesnt count against tx_bw
so its handled a bit differently.  alloc_shaper() should return a 0 for
the pcr since this gets assigned to the vcc's qos parameters.  min_pcr =
0 and max_pcr = 0 means "best effort".
still generates a warning from gcc though.
