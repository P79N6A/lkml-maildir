Hi,
I'm having problems with a new 500 GB USB disk. It works, but sometimes I
get these in dmesg:
usb 1-3: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 2
usb 5-1: USB disconnect, address 2
drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp0: removed
sd 0:0:0:0: Device not ready: <6>: Sense Key : 0x2 [current]
: ASC=0x4 ASCQ=0x2
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 254148215
sd 0:0:0:0: Device not ready: <6>: Sense Key : 0x2 [current]
: ASC=0x4 ASCQ=0x2
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 252434023
EXT3-fs error (device sda1): ext3_find_entry: reading directory #15761836
offset 0
There's also a printer connected. This is on a pci/usb2 card. When the above
happens, I get I/O errors. When I mount the drive next, there are errors
and often missing files. Quite annoying!
Kernel is 2.6.21
What's going on?
Thanks,
Niels
