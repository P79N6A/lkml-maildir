Because you'll be doing I/O on 4kB entries at least, and the overhead of
merging a 128kB request into the queue is much smaller this way. But
yes, 16 -> 26 seems quite a large win, I wouldn't expect this much
(unless you get no merging in any of the cases, then I suspect the 4kB
would be an even bigger win)

I would expect reiser to do the same. Setting the soft block size higher
is not required though, users are free to submit 4kB buffer heads even
for devices that have 1kB set. By default, it doesn't happen though.
