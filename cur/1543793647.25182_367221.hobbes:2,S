Ahh.. thought you meant the lru_add_drain run on the local processor.

smp_call_function is also used by the slab allocator to drain the 
pages. All the spinlocks in there and those of the page allocator (called 
for freeing pages) use spin_lock_irqsave. Why is this not used for 
lru_add_drain() and friends?
Maybe we need to start a new thread so that others see it?
