I am not sure. The other watchdog setup functions p3, p4, k7 are all
in nmi.c file and thats the reason I kept the new function in the same file too.
Also, as this is specific to watchdog event, it won't be called by anyone else.
If you are thinking of putting these disable and enable functions in same place so
that we can share it across i386/x86_64, we can put it in intel_cacheinfo or create
a new file for this. There is one line difference between i386 and x86_64 enable
functions due to a macro getting used in i386 version. So, we will have to workaround 
that to make this code shared.
Thanks,
Venki
