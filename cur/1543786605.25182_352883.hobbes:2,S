I got a concern here. Are we not breaking the convention. NT_TASKSTRUCT note
type represents that task_sturct is stored in note data. elf_core_dump()
and /proc/kcore already do that (That's a different story that it might not 
be needed at all). Now if we store a null NT_TASKSTURCT, same note type will
carry two meanings.
IMHO, introducing a null NT_KDUMPINFO will help in that sense, at least 
there are no two interpretations of same note type. Also it provides the
scope to add more elements to it if need be.
Thanks
