Gold plating contacts is nothing fancy that would have relevance for the
price elsewhere - but it is a way against corrosion, and been used for
decades with success. And contact problems make for nearly one half of
the issues I have here with older computers. In newer computers, having
components with moving parts that are too cheap (IOW they were saving
pennies from the wrong end) is a problem because it causes downtime
again.

I'm not exactly a friend of empiric programming if I can help it.
Sometimes, when working with closed-source firmware, there's no other
choice, but that doesn't imply everything needs to be done that way.

The bug in GNU make that Jörg complains so loudly is about is purely
cosmetic with no adverse effect on the stability of the build. It's just
spewing a few messages about non-existant .d files it is trying to
include, because of the way it works. The dependency on these files is
fully functional, it spews the warning, generates the file, and that's
it. If you feel uncomfortable with that, filter them.
GNU make is rock solid in projects much larger than Jörg can imagine,
and with more complex dependencies than he might oversee.

Reusing existing terms in different context is one of his hobbies, yes.
