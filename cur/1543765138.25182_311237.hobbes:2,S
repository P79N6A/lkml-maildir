some config changes are additions, some redefine things.
you are mistakeing the .config file for a symbol table.
for example if you compile a kernel with SMP=y you get different code then 
if you compile with SMP=n
if you have the same kernel version on identical machines, but with the 
SMP option different on the two different machines you cannot use the same 
module binary on both of them.

you would have an ABI for that kernel image, compiled with those options, 
and with that compiler. if you change any of those things then your 
modules won't work (you have a different ABI

what you are missing is that nobody has any interest in supporting a 
kernel ABI, even within a single kernel version. there are just too many 
advantages to changeing fundamantal things in the kernel depending on the 
config options.

I don't know why the default location for the modules, but again you are 
assuming that you CAN have a single vmlinuz-2.6 kernel file for all 
machines of a given arch.
you can't.
there are just too many config options that change the internals of the 
kernel (locking, function call formats, CPU type optmizations, etc) for 
you to just have one.

but 2.6.11.7 is not nessasarily binary compatable with 2.6.11.7, let alone 
something drasticly different (say 2.6.11.6)

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
