 Yep, but the reasons are different -- the embedded people are paranoid on
cutting away any possible bit of silicon and, admittedly, they are right,
to some extent.  Why do they need 36-bit physical addressing in 32-bit
cores remains a mystery to me, though, yet the MIPS32 ISA spec permits up
to 36 bits (implementation-specific) here.  Even more interesting is why
an implementation chose mapping of I/O devices there -- it's usually
easier for an OS to have them mapped within the low 29-bit address space
where they can be accessed bypassing the TLB.
