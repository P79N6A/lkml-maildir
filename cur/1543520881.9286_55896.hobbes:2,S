Yes, your following examples are examples of wrong code, but they do 
not involve locks. My current problem is that spin_lock_irqsave,
instead of atomically raising irq and grabbing lock, has been degraded
into two operations, ie, 1. raise irq, 2. grab lock, leading to the 
same problem as in your examples.

I can not follow your scenario, please give an example, involving 
cpu1, cpu2 etc, L1, L2 etc. Here is what the proposed 
spin_lock_irqsave_intercpu() function looks like in theory:
extern inline void spin_lock_irqsave_intercpu(lock, flags) 
{
loop:
	local_irq_save(flags);
        if (!spin_trylock(lock)) {
                local_irq_restore(flags);
                goto loop;
        }
}
