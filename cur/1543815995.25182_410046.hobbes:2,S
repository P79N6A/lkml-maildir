Apologies for dashing this off without the proper homework.  My
customer is out of country doing an installation, and didn't test
this configuration first :(
Customer is running RHEL3 on a 64 bit PC.  Running the 64 bit kernel
and my 64 bit driver.  They are calling the driver from their 32 bit
app.  The driver supports a whole mess of ioctls.
It seems that the kernel is trapping the 32-bit ioctl call and returning
an error to the app w/out calling the driver.  It looks like
register_ioctl32_conversion() can convice the kernel that the driver can
handle 32-bit calls, but it has to be called for each ioctl cmd (??)
Putting aside (please) discussion of whether the kernel should presume
to hijack private ioctls, and whether I should be using the ioctl
interface at all (compatibility with app interface going back to 2.0
and SunOS) is there some way to make _one_ register call to indicate
that all my cmds are safe, or maybe an alternate ioctl entry point
that the  kernel won't trap?
Yours in desperation,
Bill
