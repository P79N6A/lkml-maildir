Have you tested with Arne Koewing <ark@gmx.net>'s synaptics_reset patch:

                psmouse->name = "TouchPad";

                return PSMOUSE_PS2;
        }
w/o that patch, using 2.5 on a dell laptop disables the track point
until something else causes a rest on the ps/2 bus, such as hot-
plugging an external ps2 mouse or suspending and resuming the box.
For that matter, does running the touchpad in absolute mode affect
the track point at all?
(I'm primarily just interested in stopping the unintended mouse button
events I get from the pad's default config....)
