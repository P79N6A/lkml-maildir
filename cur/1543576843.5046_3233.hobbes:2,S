What ?
The TCP stack is threaded, so things like checksum calculation will
take advantage of multiple processors - right ?
Thes rest of the work is roughly copying data that isn't already
cached from the disk into memory.  Well, you have one disk so threads
will buy you zero there.
Unless you do blocking I/O on the files or on the sockets, I fail to
see how threads could possibly boost the performance on a web server
that serves *static*only* pages.
99% of the real work is done by the kernel, so whether you have your
user-space application threaded or not should not be an issue - the
way that I see it...
Andrea, or someone else, would you care to enlighten me on that ?
(The reason I'm curious is because I'm about a month away from implementing
 something that would run high-bandwidth TCP transfers and I'm planning
 on keeping it single-threaded - unless someone can tell me that's a bad
 idea)
Thanks,
