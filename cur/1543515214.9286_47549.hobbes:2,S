I'd have another go - I'm running 2.3.26pre2 with the various divide->shift
patches that have been posted and it's OK here.
Specifically what source files are you having problems with.
The only isssue I had was in ntfs_statfs where it divides the size of
the mft by the mft recordsize to approximate the number of files - I'm
fairly certain the the mft recordsize is not going to be a power of 2
so I just set the return value to zero as a very temporary hack.
