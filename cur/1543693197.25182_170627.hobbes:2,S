Who is the Maintainer for the (old) ISDN-Hisax-Part for the kernel-2.6 
(located in drivers/isdn/hisax)? I've digged into the code and got some 
problems. IMHO there exist some old/outdated code which will never be 
used in the current state (there are some Kernel-Config-Values which are 
not defined or which will never be used). I tried to write an module to 
get an Teles ISDN-PCMCIA Card running and run into some problems which 
prevents me from further testing now.
Any help?
Thx, Jan
PS: May someone point me to an Kernel-Module-Howto for kernel-2.6? There 
is none in the the Documentation-Directory and i did'nt found one in the 
net for now....
