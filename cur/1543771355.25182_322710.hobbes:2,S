Posting it here for comments should generate commentary, but it will also
help greatly if you format the patches properly, closely follow the kernel
coding style and include the patches in your emails.  The closer it looks
to be ready to apply to a real kernel tree, the more people will take
notice.
You can also ask for help with development, or if it's a really compelling
project, people may just dive in anyway.
