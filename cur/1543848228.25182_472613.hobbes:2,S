because it's new semantics. I was involved in this GCC feature (not in
the coding just in the asking for it) and this behavior was specifically
requested: It is called __must_check, you MUST CHECK it. It's not the
normal "unused warning", by putting the attribute on the function you
tell gcc that the result MUST be checked. Just a cast to void isn't
checking it.... so it rightfully warns.
