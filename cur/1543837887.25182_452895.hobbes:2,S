I put my name at the top when I was the primary author. 
I put Jim's name at the top when he was the primary author. 
Both names are there because I sat in Jim's office and used
his keyboard. I got him to compile and run the tests on
his hardware, and we'd then debate the results.

The patches I ave from akpm have the CC's after the 
signed-off by line, not before.
