Could we handle this by setting a nomixerreset=1 option in modules.conf
or as the module default that would effect module reloads. Then on boot
up explicitly modprobe with a mixerlevel=0 and then set the levels via
aumix etc?
This way the existing hardware can keep the levels if it knows how. As
mentioned there would also have to be a setlevels user script called
after suspend/resume.
Barring this, we could create a persistantdata module that we can
modprobe and then discover with Keith's inter_module_xxx and read/write
opaque data to/from. Then if the user does not want to use it they can
just "alias persistantdata off" it and poof.
