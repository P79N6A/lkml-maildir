ok. that makes sense. As you said the private subtree shall get copied
to the new location, however propogations wont be set in either
directions. However I have a rather unusual requirement which forces 
multiple rbind of a shared subtree within the same shared subtree.
I did the calculation and found that the tree simply explodes with
vfsstructs.  If I mark a subtree within the larger shared tree as
private, then the number of vfsstructs grows linearly O(n). However if
there was a way of marking a subtree within the larger shared tree as
unclonable than the increase in number of vfsstruct is constant.
What I am essentially driving at is, can we add another feature which 
allows me to mark a subtree as unclonable?
Read below to see how the tree explodes:
to run you through an example: 
(In case the tree pictures below gets garbled, it can also be seen at 
 
http://www.sudhaa.com/~ram/readahead/sharedsubtree/subtree
 )
step 1:
   lets say the root tree has just two directories with one vfsstruct. 
                    root
                   /    \
                  tmp    usr
    All I want is to be able to see the entire root tree 
   (but not anything under /root/tmp) to be viewable under /root/tmp/m* 
step2:
      mount --make-shared /root
      mkdir -p /tmp/m1
      mount --rbind /root /tmp/m1
      the new tree now looks like this:
                    root
                   /    \
                 tmp    usr
                /
               m1
              /  \ 
             tmp  usr
             /
            m1
          it has two vfsstructs
step3: 
            mkdir -p /tmp/m2
            mount --rbind /root /tmp/m2
the new tree now looks like this:
                      root
                     /    \ 
                   tmp     usr
                  /    \
                m1       m2
               / \       /  \
             tmp  usr   tmp  usr
             / \          / 
            m1  m2      m1 
                / \     /  \
              tmp usr  tmp   usr
              /        / \
             m1       m1  m2
            /  \
          tmp   usr
          /  \
         m1   m2
       it has 6 vfsstructs
step 4:
          mkdir -p /tmp/m3
          mount --rbind /root /tmp/m3 
          I wont' draw the tree..but it will have 24 vfstructs
at step i the number of vfsstructs V[i] = i*V[i-1] which is an
exponential function.
This is a issue in general if somebody does a --rbind of shared tree
within the same shared tree multiple times.
However this issue can be alleviated if we mark the subtree as private.
In the above example, if I mark the tree under /root/tmp as private the
number of vfsstructs will reduce drastically to O(n). 
But if there is a way of marking a subtree unclonable, this entire issue
can be resolved.
