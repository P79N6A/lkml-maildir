Mutt requires a terminal, which is not always convenient (e.g. the
copy-paste is not possible short of saving to a file, panels are infested
by similar icons). It is the ultimate text-mode client though.
I picked the Sylpheed from DaveM. It is unusually customizeable, for
a GUI client. It can corrupt patches if they have non-ASCII characters,
but that's something unavoidable, until the world switches to UTF-8
at least. Other than that, it has no discernable vices regarding
the whitespace mangling or line wrapping.
