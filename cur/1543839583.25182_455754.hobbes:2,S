I agree.

I wouldn't call those false positives.  They're warnings of poorly
written code that might fail with further changes to the kernel or with
custom security modules, or on another Unix-like platform.
Of course, the kernel or security modules must not change the semantics
arbitrarily yet expect old apps to work, however expecting that apps
honor return value from set*[ug]id() would be reasonable.  (The only
reason why it is not is that there are so many broken apps out there and
more are being developed.)
