Subject: [PATCH] as: Fix issue reported by coverity in drivers/block/as-iosched.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/27/191

This fixes an issue found in drivers/block/as-iosched.c by Coverity.
Error reported: 
CID: 3167
Checker: FORWARD_NULL (help)
File: /export2/p4-coverity/mc2/linux26/drivers/block/as-iosched.c
Function: as_insert_request
Description: Variable "arq" tracked as NULL was passed to a function that 
dereferences it.
Patch description:
It looks as if the code already assumes that arq != NULL. If arq == NULL, it
should crash later where arq is dereferenced(e.g. as_add_request) without
checking.  Removed the NULL check.
