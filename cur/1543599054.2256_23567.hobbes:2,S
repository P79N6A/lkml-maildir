Please enlighten me: do daemons need to be writted with some support
code specific for inetd in order to be compatible with it?

I have rpc.portmap started just before inetd in my init script.

For now, my machine is under very light load (around 0.0) so this is
not a problem.
But I experiment a lot with different Linux toys
(NFS,Samba,TFTP,BOOTP/DHCP,PostgreSQL,MySQL). I'd like to configure it
so that under light load daemons die out, leaving bare minimum
(ideally, inetd only)
I presume daemons spawned by inetd are supposed to be designed so they
lurk around for some time in case some more requests are coming for them
and die after a timeout? Can they be made to spawn additional daemons when
load increases? This behavior would be nice - no need to guess how
many nfsd daemons to spawn for NFS, httpd's for HTTP etc.
Want to know why I'm asking all this?
