Bartlomiej is the old IDE layer maintainer. I would direct any enquiries
to him about those drivers.

2.6.17 with the libata pata patch from
http://zeniv.linux.org.uk/~alan/IDE
 has a Promise driver for the PDC
20268 and higher that was written by Albert Lee. There is also a test
driver for the older chips (20265 etc).
To try that build 2.6.17 with the patch and then say "N" to CONFIG_IDE,
"Y" to the SATA options under SCSI and the right controller. It will
move your disks to /dev/sda /dev/sdb etc as it uses the SCSI layer.
