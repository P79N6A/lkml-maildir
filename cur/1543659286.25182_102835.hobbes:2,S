I think Dave needs a diff that allows me to keep as many patches
in sync as bk lets me.  We don't all have your superhuman
patch-fu Alan 8-)
I do periodic GNU diffs of the 'big bundle o' patches'.
There are even split up versions of the patches.
All there to see at k.o
The merges Ive done with bitkeeper to Linus recently
have been diffs already posted to the 2.4 commit list.
Asides from the AGP bits, which were 99% already posted
to linux-kernel. The remainder were trivial things, and they
showed up in -bk an hour or so later anyways..
