Hello everyone,
The system I am working on is a single processor Athlon. In the kernel I 
need to detect a cache miss (L1/L2) and trigger an event/function 
(inside the kernel). Now we have performance counters for 
detecting/counting cache misses. Among the various tools/patches 
available for accessing performance counters, which one do you guys 
recommend. Or do you think it would be easy to write code for this 
myself, as i just need this one event detection. Can you give some links 
where one can read about programming performance counters or some book 
on it.
Thanks a lot.
please cc reply to me too.
