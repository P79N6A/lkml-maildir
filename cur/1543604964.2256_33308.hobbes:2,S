The bad performance of the VM in earlier kernels is really visible to
management, which is why going to something more capable is desirable (and
works well). The issue was that Linux has always taken too long to get the
development kernel series out, which encourages development work in the
"stable" kernel. Currently the -ac kernels tend to avoid flights of fancy
and "jackpot" bad VM bahaviour. Making a parameter name change just seems
a very odd thing.

People who are sticking with obsolete kernels aren't on this list in
general, I don't upgrade until there's a reason, but much better
performance visible to the user is definitely a reason.
I would love to see Alan do the stable releases and Linus do the
development, and a development branch at the time of the first release
candidates for a new stable branch.
If Linux is going to continue to gain credibility as an everyday, every
application o/s, which I think everyone on the list believes is desirable,
then a little effort to behave a bit more like traditional development is
a good thing. World domination take some "low animal cunning*" as well as
a better technical product.
