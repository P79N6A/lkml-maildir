Well I'm confused I know I tested this, and I even added a printk and
saw it trigger a couple of times.
Hmm.  Looking at the code it is clearly not safe to hold the tty_mutex
when calling tty_vhangup.  I thought the other caller in tty_io.c was doing
that but on a second glance it is clearly not.  And the hangup and close
methods do seem to take the tty_mutex.
How this worked in my testing is beyond me..
I will see if I can generate a better patch later.
