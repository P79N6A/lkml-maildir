No data loss is a good thing!  That was my biggest worry, as I have no
documentation for the addon card case.  Out of curiosity, did the LED
usage change at all before and after the patch, or was it totally
unaffected.  I would guess the latter.
Unfortunately, what documentation I do have shows (briefly) that add
on cards implement their LED via a different mechanism.  If I knew the
addresses for the flash read and write strobes (FL_RDN and FL_WRN), I
might be able to work something out.  So as it stands, there is not
much hope for the people with addon cards.

Thanks, I will.  I have emailed Silicon Image in the (slim) chance
that they will provide me with the information I require.  If they
come through then I might be able to whip something up and have you
test it.
If anyone has any data on the 3112a (or 3512 as I believe they are
register compatible) and isn't bound by an NDA, I'd like to hear from
you.
