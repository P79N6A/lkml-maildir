Because 100 4K drivers suddenly becomes 0.5Mb. There are those of us trying
to stuff Linux into embedded devices who if anything want more configuration
options not people taking stuff out.
What I'd much rather see if this is an issue is:
bool	'Do you want to customise for a very small system' 
which auto enables all the random small stuff if you say no, and goes
much deeper into options if you say yes.
