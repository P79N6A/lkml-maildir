Rob,
	Here's an edit on the WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT ioctl:
WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT:
	If the watchdog has a configurable timeout, then this is how and
	where it gets set (other than module load or kernel command line).
	The passed argument is the new timeout in seconds.  Watchdogs
	with a granularity that does not allow the new timeout must set
	the timeout to the next greater allowable timeout.  The watchdog
	must never fire in less than the passed timeout.  After setting 
	the new timeout, the ioctl copies the actual timeout in seconds
        back to userspace.  This allows userspace to know what the
	timeout really is.
Thanks,
Joel
