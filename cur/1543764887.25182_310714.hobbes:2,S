Here's the result:
BUG_ON(!pbe->address) hits, so is seems to be a swsusp problem.
So I added a BUG_ON(!to_copy) as shown below (mangled for mailing):
if (saveable(zone, &zone_pfn)) {
       struct page * page;
       BUG_ON(!to_copy);
       page = pfn_to_page(zone_pfn + zone->zone_start_pfn);
       pbe->orig_address = (long) page_address(page);
       /* copy_page is not usable for copying task structs. */
       BUG_ON(!pbe->address);
       memcpy((void *)pbe->address, (void *)pbe->orig_address,
              PAGE_SIZE);
       pbe++;
       to_copy--;
}
The BUG_ON(!to_copy) hits, too.
So it seems that the result sum of saveable() increases between
count_data_pages() and copy_data_pages(). The problem seems to be
easiest hit when starting a larger GUI application and suspending during
application startup. It does ususally take a few suspend/resume
iterations to hit the bug.
Pavel,
the crypto stuff in swsusp.c starts in data_write() which is called
after copy_data_pages() if I'm right. In this case the crypto stuff
can't be the culprit.
