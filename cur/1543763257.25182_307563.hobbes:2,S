update: i found a bug in the latency tracer that could explain some of 
the artifacts you noticed, IRQs would reset the tracing timer under 
certain circumstances. So sometimes traces would show up, sometimes they 
wouldnt - and even if traces were generated, they often were truncated.  
The bug is fixed in the -41-24 patch. If you were hit by this bug then 
you'll likely see new and larger latencies reported.
