Oh. The definition I was using is based on which PCI devices can do
peer-to-peer transactions. ie a "PCI Domain" is defined by the
PCI MMIO address space routing.

yes - that makes sense for configuration space accesses.
I can see why you'd call this a "PCI Domain" as well.
The platforms I was commenting on can only generate config cycles below
a PCI "Host Bus Adapter" (aka controller).
