Subject: incorrect taint of ndiswrapper

It seems that the kernel module loader taints ndiswrapper module as
proprietary, but it is not - it is fully GPL: see
http://directory.fsf.org/sysadmin/hookup/ndiswrapper.html
Note that when a driver is loaded, ndiswrapper does taint the kernel (to be
more accurate, it should check if the driver being loaded is GPL or not, but
that is not done).
Thanks,
Giri
