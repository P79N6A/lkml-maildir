Just to clarify, setting compute 1 implys interactive
0?
These numbers are very reproducable nad have done them
(in a continuous loop) for two hours.
The test is a make of headers for a propritary exec. 
Making headers is rather simple is all it does it link
a bunch of h files (traversing dirs) and some
dependance generation (3 files, yacc and lex).  I have
moved the source code base to local disk to dicount
nfs issues (though the difference is neglibible and
nfs performance on 2.6 is generally faster than 2.4).
I have tried to get a good test case that can be
submitted. Still trying. 
Any suggestions to try to diagnose this?
Thanks!
