If it is any help, SGI patched the ia64 perfmon code to cope with a 2.4
version of the out of line spinlock patch.  The ia64 code uses a
non-standard calling sequence to work around a bug in gcc prior to 3.4,
r28 is the return address for the out of line code.
pfm_record_sample()
{
	...
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
        extern char ia64_spinlock_contention[], ia64_spinlock_contention_end[];
#endif
	...
        h->ip   = regs ? regs->cr_iip | ((regs->cr_ipsr >> 41) & 0x3): 0x0UL;
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
        if (h->ip >= (unsigned long)ia64_spinlock_contention &&
                        h->ip < (unsigned long)ia64_spinlock_contention_end)
                h->ip = regs->r28;
#endif
	...
