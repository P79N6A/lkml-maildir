Fixed in 0.1.1

Checked this - and can't reproduce it with one keyboard. With two
keyboards the focus is changing for each keyboard separately - this
is intentional, and is a beginning of multihead support.

Should be fixed in 0.1.1 The problem was that when the mouse wasn't
plugged in during the BIOS POST, the BIOS removed IRQ 12 from the
i8042, and then though the AUX port was still there, it was nonworking.
The 0.1.1 code works this situation around by creating a synthetised
interrupt to flush the buffers if the true one doesn't come.

Fixed the mouse wheel in 0.1.1. HID parser is still far in the future.

Nothing new here yet.
If you can, try out the 0.1.1 if it fixes your trouble.
