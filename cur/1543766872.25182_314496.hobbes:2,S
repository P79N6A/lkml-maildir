I don't think that will include page tables, unless the architecture
allocates page tables from slab (some might, especially recently).
And it won't have memory that didn't come from slab, e.g.
get_free_pages() or anything else right off the buddy allocator.
There is no easy way to do this.  To do it right, we'd need fine-grained
accounting.
