Did anybody send the press release to CNET?  An article went up yesterday
around noon that seems to be based very closely on the content of the
press release, but it is not quoted directly.
In any case, the article, while short and not particularly informative,
is positive and mentions most of the bullet points from the press
release -- so the release did its job.
The article is at:
