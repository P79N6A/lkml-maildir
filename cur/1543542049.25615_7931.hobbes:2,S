I know the above is an open flamebait, so let me state clearly that I am
well aware of the fact that one can allocate the same 100M multiple times
and I still don't call this "overcommit" because those 100M are available
at the time of allocation, i.e. at the time vm_enough_memory() is called.
Yes, if all processes want their memory immediately, some of them are
going it get killed and that is an unfortunate fact of life, but I can
live with it.
