it enterely depends on the workload. On a desktop machine there may be
only some hundred entries in those lists at maximum with glibc being the
biggest offender:
cat /proc/*/maps | grep libc.so.6 | wc -l
with shared memory on some server there can be easily several thousand
entries for some inode even on 64bit, but a timeslice was probably
exaggerated (the timeslice was for the walking of the ptes in each
mapping too, I don't think you need to look at every pte).
