We provide two different ioctl commands, it is not a bad multiplexer.
We have discussed this before.
We do use the fd.  It maps back to the inotify device.

It is not implausible to believe that a system might have the default
maximum for file descriptors (not very high) but allow a _much_ greater
number of inotify watches (32k, say).
That is our rationale.  I hear what you are saying, I understand it, and
at the end of the day I disagree.  I appreciate your input, but I feel
otherwise.

Everything to you is "really bad" and "totally unacceptable".  Chill
out.  Stop ranting so much and enjoy life.
