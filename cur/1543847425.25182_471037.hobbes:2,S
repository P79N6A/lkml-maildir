Agreed. That would also allow to pass down knowledge of wether we can be
interruptible or not (coming from userland or not). Useful in a few case
when dealing with strange hw mappings.
Now, fault() still returns a struct page and thus doesn't quite fix the
problem I'm exposing in my "User switchable HW mappings & cie" mail I
posted today in which case we need to either duplicate the truncate
logic in no_pfn() or get rid of no_pfn() and set the PTE from the fault
handler . I tend to prefer the later provided that it's strictly limited
for mappings that do not have a struct page though.
