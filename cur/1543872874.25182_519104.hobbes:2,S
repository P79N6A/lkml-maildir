Unfortunately we have some vendor-supplied software that does care about 
timeslices.  It's a crazy thing with multiple SCHED_RR kernel threads 
that don't really self-manage very well.  They're spawned by a 
SCHED_OTHER task and inherit its nice level.
We modified the startup for the spawning task to run it at a lower nice 
level and were fairly surprised when the latency of message handling 
went way up.
