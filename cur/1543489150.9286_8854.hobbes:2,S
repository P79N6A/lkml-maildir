Just out of curiosity, couldn't the resolving of symlinks all be
done in the userland?  Rough outline of the idea is to make all
system calls that takes any pathname parameter to return an
error indicator, visible only to the caller (usually inside of
libc), and if the error indicator says it encountered a symlink,
the caller resolves the symlink(s) before retrying the call.  If
the return from these new set of system calls are anything other
than the `I see symlinks; resolve them and come back to me',
that can be returned to the caller of the libc.  We can even
phase in these new set of syscall interfaces while retaining the
current interface, until we update libc to be aware of this new
error condition.
