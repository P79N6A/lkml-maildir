If sending routines can work with constant ammount of memory, why use
kmalloc at all? Anyway I thought we were talking receiving side
earlier in the thread.
Ouch and wait a moment. You claim that GFP_KERNEL allocations can't
block/sleep? Of course they can, that's why they are GFP_KERNEL and
not GFP_ATOMIC.
