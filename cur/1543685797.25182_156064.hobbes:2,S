Preempt, and/or occupy cpu space which would otherwise be available for the 
root realtime task.  If a SCHED_SOFTRR task or tasks share the same queue 
with an SCHED_RR task, or occupy a higher queue, runtime of the 
SCHED_SOFTRR tasks[s] will have an effect on the root realtime task.  OTOH, 
if SCHED_SOFTRR queues were below the 'full potency' realtime queues, they 
would be able to neither preempt, not round-robin with the root authorized 
realtime task.
