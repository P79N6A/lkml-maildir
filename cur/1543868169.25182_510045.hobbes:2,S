I am no judge of that. All I know about the possibilities of Kbuild
is what the files in Documentation/kbuild tell me. From browsing
through other kernel Makefiles it would appear that there are more
possibilities though, such as if/then/else constructs.

Alright, then so be it. But that raises another question:
asyncdata.o is only needed for M105 and M101, not for the base
driver. How do I express in Kbuild that asyncdata.o is to be added
to gigaset-y only if CONFIG_GIGASET_M105 and CONFIG_GIGASET_M101
are not both 'n'?
Thanks,
Tilman
