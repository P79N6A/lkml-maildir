yeah. It would lead to incorrect code to use a completion if the purpose 
is a real lock. The main non-PREEMPT_RT-compatible use of semaphores is 
the unlocking of a semaphore the task did not lock itself. It is correct 
Linux code, so that alone is not a good reason to change upstream (and 
upstream doesnt and shouldnt bother about PREEMPT_RT at this point) - 
but if the underlying code is not entirely clean and the cross-owner-use 
of locks is not justified it might be possible to solve this via a 
cleanup.
