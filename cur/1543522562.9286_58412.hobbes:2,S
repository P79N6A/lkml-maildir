Alim15x3 driver prior to kernel 2.3.28 was unable to properly detect our chipset rev ;)
Anyway you can read your PCI bus speed from /proc/ide/ali
Tom> I hope to try this once I have backed-up my root HD. I'm puzzled by the 
Tom> argument to idebus. Where do you get the 30 from? I cannot find any 
Reading the source, idebus is used only if you are PIOing wich is not your case and
that's why you don't see "..assuming 40Mhz" message anymore.
Tom> Does anybody know the nature of the 'instability' ? 
I've hack the driver to _force_ udma33 with my revision 0x20, please don't do that !!
This completely _fuck_ my hdc WDC AC24300L, and I need to repartitioning
but with my new IBM-DJNA-371350 I've got _very_ good result and right
now I didn't fall back to dma2 :| 
I've moved several gbytes of data, compiled to many kernels and run several
benchmarks without any problems:

I don't know why I'm so slow in buffer-cache, maybe the fastpage ram ?
