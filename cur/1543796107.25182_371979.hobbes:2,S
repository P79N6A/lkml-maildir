Hi,
I'm trying to use git and in the middle of installing it on the RHEL4 U2.
I have following modules in hand.
- git-core-0.99.7-1.i386.rpm
- cogito-0.15.1-1.noarch.rpm
During 'git-core-0.99.7-1.i386.rpm' installation, I'm getting following
error message,
[root@dhcp root]# rpm-ihv git-core-0.99.7-1.i386.rpm
error: Failed dependencies:
	perl(String::ShellQuote) is needed by git-core-0.99.7-1.i386
	python >= 2.4 is needed by git-core-0.99.7-1.i386
Where can I find those modules?
Also, please point out if you see any further obstacles along the way to
move forward.
Any feedback would be appreciated.
Regards,
Seokmann
