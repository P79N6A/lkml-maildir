Hi all,
  most net device drivers have replaced MOD_INC/DEC_USE_COUNT with
SET_MODULE_OWNER but SET_MODULE_OWNER doesn't do nothing.
  Therefore, those modules (though I can only vouch for 8139too) always
report 0 use. Some people that had "modprobe -r" in their cronttab found
it quite annoying.
  I'd guess that there's a good reason for why struct net_device doesn't
have .owner field and why this happens. Can someone be so kind to point
it
out?
