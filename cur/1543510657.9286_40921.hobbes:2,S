Unfortunately, code is also a poor substitute for documentation.

I don't think anyone's claiming that it can be. I think the claim is
just that you can get it close enough to help.

I disagree. I think guessing at what the Right Way is by looking at
what other code does with those interfaces encourages bad habits
because nothing tells you not to do them.

I don't think the goal is to completely replace reading the code with
documentation. I think the goal should be to have the documentation
serve as an introduction to the interfaces. Yes, you'll never
understand a piece of code as well by reading about it as you will by
reading it, but you'll get a basic level of knowledge faster and with 
less effort by reading documentation.

I'm not convinced this is bad. There _should_ be some inertia to an
interface; otherwise, what's the point?

I'm not sure this is true; documentation can simply mean "this is how
this works, and this is how it changed since the last version" instead 
of "this is how it works now and always". Mention that interfaces can
change in the documentation; make sure the reader knows that. Make the 
few relatively unchangeable interfaces loud and obvious exceptions.

Well, yes. Most worthwhile things are.

So? Are you sure we couldn't do better with it?

Unfortunately, even that sort of documentation is often outdated and
not as useful as it could be. So even if we entirely reject the idea
of API documentation, it would still be good to try and keep what
little documentation that we do have up to date.
