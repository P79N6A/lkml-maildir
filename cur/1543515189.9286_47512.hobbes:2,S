I don't know if slackware used to do that, but I'm running slackware 6.3
beta (with some 7.0 packages) and it uses symlinks. I'm pretty sure it
used symlinks back in the 3.x days - I remember getting weird errors
whenever I tried to compile something relating to header files missing
when I removed the kernel source (back when I was just starting out with
Linux)
