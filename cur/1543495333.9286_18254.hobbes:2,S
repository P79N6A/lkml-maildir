The apparent kernel memory leak problem I asked about a few days ago has been
solved: "pump", the DHCP client daemon that comes with RedHat 6.0 did not
close the raw packet socket that was opened to handle DHCP transactions. Thus,
every time the DHCP lease was refreshed, some memory was lost in the kernel. I
probably would not have noticed this, if I hadn't kept the lease duration very
short in my test network.
Lots of thanks to all of you who helped, especially Andrea. 
Apoligies for having cast suspicion on the kernel :)
