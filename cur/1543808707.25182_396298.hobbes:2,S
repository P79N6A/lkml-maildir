Sigh...  12 works at the limit on your particular config, filesystems
being used and syscall being issued (hint: amount of stuff on stack
before we enter mutual recursion varies; so does the amount of stuff
on stack we get from function that are not part of mutual recursion,
but are called from the damn thing).
