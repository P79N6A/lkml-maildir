Makes sense, will do.  How about calling it INFINIBAND_USE_IPV6 or
something like that, though?  (Since it's under the INFINIBAND config
stuff and exists to forbid INFINIBAND=y && IPV6=m trying to use IPv6).

this doesn't make sense, does it?  Your CONFIG_IF_IPV6 will be set in
the case IPV6=n too I think.  (Which is the whole point... we want to
build this code, just without IPv6 support, if IPv6 is turned off
completely)
