I appreciate seeing finally kernel support for this but have a few
problems with the actual implementation:
- CLONE_ITIMERS
  The meaning of the flag should be reverted.  Since sharing itimers
  among all threads in a process is the POSIX behaviour this bit must
  be set.  But it is not in existing implementation for obvious reasons.
  This is a general problem with extensions to the clone interface.
- MAX_ITIMERS
  This should be TIMER_MAX.  POSIX does not define  MAX_ITIMERS.
- There is no DELAYTIMER_MAX definition.
  This might be missing since the implementation is not yet finished
  but in case this is not the reason please add it.
