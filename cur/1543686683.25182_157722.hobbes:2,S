  Intel plans Linux support for Centrino
  Intel is working on Linux support for Centrino, its package of chips for
  mobile computers with wireless networking abilities, but the company
  hasn't yet decided how or when to release it.
That was on March 24, 2003.
Well, that was almost 5 months ago. So I figured I'd ask if there's any
progress -- so far the built-in wireless in my notebook still doesn't
work with Linux and the machine is monstrously power-hungry because
Linux doesn't scale the CPU frequency.
I know there are some Intel people on the list -- perhaps someone can
comment?
