Here's the suggested (totally untested as of yet) patch:
 - it moves the system call page to 0xffffe000 instead, leaving an
   unmapped page at the very top of the address space. So trying to
   dereference -1 will cause a SIGSEGV.
 - it adds the AT_SYSINFO elf entry on x86 that points to the system page.
Thus glibc startup should be able to just do
	ptr = default_int80_syscall;
	if (AT_SYSINFO entry found)
		ptr = value(AT_SYSINFO)
and then you can just do a
	call *ptr
to do a system call regardless of kernel version. This also allows the
kernel to later move the page around as it sees fit.
The advantage of using an AT_SYSINFO entry is that
 - no new system call needed to figure anything out
 - backwards compatibility (ie old kernels automatically detected)
 - I think glibc already parses the AT entries at startup anyway
so it _looks_ like a perfect way to do this.
