GPL gives you the right to remove the BSD licensing *TERMS*, but this has no
effect on the actual license. The works do not become GPLv2 only just
because you removed the licensing terms.

Exactly. So you *cannot* change the license, you can only remove the
licensing terms. And even if you do modify it, that still has no effect on
the available licenses for any creative elements you did not author.
"6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions."
For both the GPL and the BSD license, anyone who receives covered works or
elements receives the offered licenses directly from the original author.
There is nothing you can do to change this.
Neither the BSD license nor the GPL license allow you to in any way modify
the license or licenses offered by anyone else to creative elements they
authored. In the United States, at least, this is not even possible without
a written re-licensing agreement. The licenses always flow from each
creative element's original author to the final end user. Distributors
simply provide copies of the works, they do *NOT* relicense them. People who
modify the works simply add and license other creative elements, they do not
relicense the existing ones.
