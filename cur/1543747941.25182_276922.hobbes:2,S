I do not view BLKRRPART as a request to read the partition table.
It is a request to revalidate: "if the disk is in use, return EBUSY,
otherwise, discard any old information, read any new information".
If the disk is blank then there is no new information to read,
that is not an error, and certainly not an I/O error.

Yes, I think I want to - am getting worried mail from people
who very much dislike I/O errors on a brand-new disk.
