When I tried removing large files on filesystem with 1k blocks there is
indeed a lot of seek activity visible on the disk.

Actually I made such a test a few weeks ago.
I made 2 500MB filesystems on a SCSI disk, one with 1kB block size
and the another with 4kB block size.
I must admit the test is not 100% scientific, since the filesystems were
in different locations on the same disk, so there might be some
differences in seek time or transfer speed depending on physical location
on the disk (I just did not believe it would make much difference, so I
have stopped these tests).
The test was like this :
I created 4 files 100MB each on one filesystem,
and 4 identical files on another filesystem (using dd from /dev/zero,
ibs=1k, obs=1024k);
Then I timed rm command;
For files on filesystem with 1k block size, removing one file took about
7 seconds elapsed time; for files on filesystem with 4k block size
it took 0.1 to 0.2 second, that is more than 30 times faster.
When removing files from filesystem with 1k block size, vmstat showed
about 60 operations per second  in bi column and 6..10 operations
in bo columns every 6..8 seconds:

The tests were performed on an idle system with RedHat Linux 5.2 with
updates for 2.2 kernels and 2.2.5 kernel with no patches.

I would suggest that filesystems containg large files be created with
block size larger than 1k. In my tests involving 500MB filesystems and
100MB files the time difference for rm command was more that 30-fold
between filesystem with 4kB block and one with 1kB block size.
If you deal with even larger files, you might want to test performance
of filesystems with even larger block size.
