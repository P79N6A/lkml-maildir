Just remember plase to map it to /proc/sys/kernel/xxx
So we could implement the following properly:
_SC_CLK_TCK            CLK_TCK       Ticks per second          (clock_t)
(Taken from Solaris pecs.)
Unless of course we stick to the fact that HZ exposed
to user land remains an arch specific constant as in 2.5.25 which
I think is the more prefferable solution.
Pitty is RedHat beta does mess with this! The 2.5.25 solutoin from
Linus is far better.
