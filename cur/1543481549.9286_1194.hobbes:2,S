If you mean disk quotas, no I'm not using those. If you mean rlimit,
then they are:
core file size (blocks)     1048576
data seg size (kbytes)      unlimited
file size (blocks)          unlimited
max locked memory (kbytes)  unlimited
max memory size (kbytes)    unlimited
open files                  1024
pipe size (512 bytes)       8
stack size (kbytes)         8192
cpu time (seconds)          unlimited
max user processes          256
virtual memory (kbytes)     unlimited

Nope.
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda3             4.0G  3.6G  207M  95% /
/dev/hda1             4.2G  3.0G  1.2G  71% /dos
That reminds me, I could read and write /dos even while I has having
trouble with /. (/dos is vfat32, / is ext2fs. I should also note that no
network file systems were involved.)
