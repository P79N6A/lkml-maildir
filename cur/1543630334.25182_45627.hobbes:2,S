 The PS/2 mouse and the keyboard (or the 8042, actually) are motherboard
devices using the 0x00-0xff range of I/O ports -- ISA is above that.
 For serial and parallel ports it depends on their configuration. 
Traditionally they are ISA devices, but PCI variations are manufactured
these days as well.
