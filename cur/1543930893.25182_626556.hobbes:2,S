We know this. The problem is that there is no good known way to 
figure out which machines need it. Also it is typically 
slow hardware anyways -- the most time critical is probably
the 8259, but nobody who cares about performance still uses 
it except as a fail safe fallback and for those it is better
to be conservative.

Anyways it looks like the discussion here is going in a
a loop. I had hoped David would post his test results with
another port so that we know for sure that the bus aborts 
(and not port 80) is the problem on his box. But it looks like
he doesn't want to do this. Still removing the bus aborts
is probably the correct way to go forward.
Only needs a patch now. If nobody beats me to it i'll
add one later to my tree.
