No, let me rephrase that....
Bollocks.  I wish that every time people started a sentence by going
"Most people..." they would just remember that what they really mean
is "I".  The number of people who care about the fact that you don't
want to be able to use hot-swap on your laptop is, I suspect, quite
small.  As the man said "PCMCIA without hot-plug is nothing but ISA
support".
This is also hopelessly off-topic.
