Looking at fs/squashfs/inode.c (in the release used on Gentoo) I've found this 
code:
static inline struct squashfs_inode_info *SQUASHFS_I(struct inode *inode)
{
        return list_entry(inode, struct squashfs_inode_info, vfs_inode);
}
From the cosmetical point of view, shouldn't that be:
        return container_of(inode, struct squashfs_inode_info, vfs_inode);
? The implementation is the same, but the second is clearer (adding a 
definition in the header would be OK if you need that it works on 2.4, if 
that's the reason).
My 2 cents.
Regards.
