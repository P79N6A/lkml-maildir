Btw, I also want to see what intense "for-optimization" high-order
allocators are going to do to the current VM. 
Think about the possible intensive pressure (and CPU wasted) caused by,
for example, SCSI code which _always_ tries to do 1-order allocations (or
bigger?) to allocate scatter/gather tables. We want those allocations to
fail to 0-order allocations instead looping madly inside the VM freeing
routines.
