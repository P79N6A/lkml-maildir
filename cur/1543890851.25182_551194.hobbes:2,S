Hm, I wouldn't limit the mechanism prematurely.  Using Valgrind as an
example of an alternate user of this mechanism, it would be useful to
use a pipe to transmit out-of-band information from an exec-er to an
exec-ee process.  At the moment there's a lot mucking around with
execve() to transmit enough information from the parent valgrind to its
successor.
