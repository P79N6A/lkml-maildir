You are wrong.
Section 5.1.2.2.2 of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 says:
In a hosted environment, a program may use all functions, macros, type 
definitions, and objects described in the library clause (clause 7).
Since a hosted environment means gcc+libc, it's therefore clear that gcc 
can assume the presence of a full libc if gcc isn't told that it's used 
as a freestanding environment.
