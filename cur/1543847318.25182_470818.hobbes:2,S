That simplicity means setting up timers in kernel space and determining when
a device is "active". You only simplify the interface.

I can have suspend without wakeup. It just means that I need to
hit a key to make X notice me again.

That is exactly the point.

What allows you to assume that I want to suspend the whole system?
That power/latency tradeoff is not a policy to be set in kernel.

I did not speak about X11. I can keep X pretty busy with keyboard and
touchpad. Nevertheless my mouse has no business going to sleep even
if I don't move it and it is the only usb device.
