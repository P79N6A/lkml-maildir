I tried your example and I was able to reproduce the OOPS that you
found.. Although there is one problem, you don't have the same number of
up()'s to down() calls so you end up leaving the dummy_read function
with the lock still held ..
Reviewing the OOPS and the warnings it looks like your progressively
corrupting the mutex waiter list since remove_waiter() actually leaves
the stack based waiter object on the waiter list.. (That's what it looks
like anyway)..
So I converted your code to use a compat_semaphore, and no oops
happens.. Which makes sense because compat_semaphores are designed to
work the way your using them.
