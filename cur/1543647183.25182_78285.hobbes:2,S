I spent some time discussing this with David and we couldn't quite come to
an agreement, so I want to see what other people think...
From: "Linux Kernel Mailing List" <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>" really
bugs me.  I want to be able to skim down the message list and see at least
"ingo" instead of "Linux Kernel Mai".  But how to do this?
My instinct is:
From: :USER: at :HOST: <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
Mail-Followup-To: Linux Kernel Mailing List <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
Reply-To: Linux Kernel Mailing List <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
Which should get all mailers to do just about the right thing.
