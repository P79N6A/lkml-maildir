Andreas,
Thanks for the perfect explanation to our problems. The question then arises as
to why does SUSE do KBUILDS in this way and the vanilla kernels or Redhat/Fedora/Mandrake/Debian
kernels use another way?. What I'd like to see is at least some standard.
SuSE's Linux 2.6.4 kernels did it the Vanilla kernel way where /lib/modules/2.6.4/build pointed to /usr/src/linux.
The issue is also SuSE's 2.6.4 kernel added the REGPARM patch which was only introduced in Linux 2.6.5
for example. Wouldn't it be better if SuSE had shipped their kernel as Linux 2.6.5?. The point is
what constitutes a "baseline" Linux kernel?. You can add all your patches but if now the kernel is
more in tune with Linux 2.6.7, just call it Linux 2.6.7 - calling it 2.6.5 will break a lot of software.
that isn't included with your kernel sources.
I don't care if SuSE adds patches to drivers but to patch the base kernel/headers in way that breaks
out-of-kernel drivers is something we would like to see addressed.
Ofcourse we will now have to modify our software to detect a SuSE distribution but it's waste of time
and energy because the other distros don't use your concepts. If you deem that your way of building
modules is the "right thing" then I'd love to see Linus move to such a system in his vanilla kernel
source tree.
Most out-of-kernel drivers like ours or other vendors simply rely on kernel include files and not
on the actual .c files. THe location and contents of such kernel includes should be inviolable if
there is a kernel version associated with it.
