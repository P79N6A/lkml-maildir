along the same lines, it would probably be a good idea to have the ability 
for a system to re-ask for the pass phrase periodicly while the system is 
running.
I see two possible approaches to these issues.
1. implement the periodic re-request capability, and when going into 
hibernate time-out any known pass phrases.
this is a lot of work overall, but the suspend portion is trivial so there 
would not be any suspend surprises.
2. flush the keyring on hibernate and have the resume process re-populate 
it (either by pokeing directly into the memory, or by providing a table 
that the resuming kernel reads from during wake-up to re-populate it)
this is less work, but it's all suspend related so it will get less 
testing.
