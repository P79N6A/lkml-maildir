I've structured the aio userland structure so that this is possible, just 
not implemented yet.  There are fields for compatible and incompatible 
features, as well as the length of the header.  This way, the library can 
implement a faster getevents call when futex support is added, but it 
always has the option of falling back to the syscall should it not understand 
any changes we make to the data structure.
