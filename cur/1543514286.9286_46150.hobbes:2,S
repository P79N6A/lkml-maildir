I think the license that Intel put on their gigibit ethernet driver would
be GPL-compatible if they added the right to sublicense. They do not. The
X11 license does, and is otherwise GPL-compatible in the restrictions it
makes, and thus you can apply the GPL to any work under the X11 license and
combine that work with GPL code.
The Intel driver does not meet test #2 of the Open Source Definition because
it has been deliberately obfuscated. 
I agree with other posters that the best use of the software is as notes
for writing an un-obfuscated, GPL version.
Someone was clueless at Intel for shooting themselves in the foot this way.
They would lose nothing by distributing an unobfuscated driver.
	Thanks
