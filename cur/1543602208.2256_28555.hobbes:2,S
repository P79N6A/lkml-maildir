Well, of course, turning off the cache will cause performance penalties,
but it at least gives you a chance to get away with a recoverable file
system should the power fail or the box crash.

I switched a box to ext3 with write caches off in expectance of multiple
power outages during works, and NOTHING happened. I expect that box is
now writing 4 times slower than before, I have no real figures, and it's
still "smooth enough" in spite of 2.4.9.

Utterly non-sense.
Linear writing as dd mostly does is BTW something which should never be
affected by write caches.
