Fine, I definitely like this compiler change 8).
The new IKD patch for 2.2.11 that will compile also with the latest gcc is
here:

FYI: I have not fixed yet the kdebugger single step trap-bug by merging
the latest kernel debugger (I am getting lots of bug report about this).
I'll do that ASAP (I personally don't use the kernel debugger so it's very
low priority for me...).
Thanks Mike!
