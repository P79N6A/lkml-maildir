Subject: [PATCH 7/6] fill_tgid: cleanup delays accounting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

fill_tgid() should skip not only an already exited group leader. If the
task has ->exit_state != 0 it already did exit_notify(), so it also did
fill_tgid_exit()->delayacct_add_tsk(->signal->stats) and we should skip
it to avoid a double accounting.
This patch doesn't close the race completely, but it cleanups the code.
