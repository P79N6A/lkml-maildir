OK.

Hmm, netperf, hackbench, and fio are all faster with SLAB than SLUB.

Thanks. I guess one of three obvious differences, mine is a K10, is
NUMA, and has significantly more cores. I can try setting it to
interleave cachelines over nodes or use fewer cores to see if the
picture changes...

OK, good to know.

To be honest, my biggest concern with SLUB is the higher order pages
thing. But Christoph always poo poos me when I raise that concern, and
it's hard to get concrete numbers showing real fragmentation problems
when it can take days or months to start biting.
It really stems from queueing versus not queueing I guess. And I think
SLUB is flawed due to its avoidance of queueing.

No. I'm imagining there will be a discussion of the 3, and at some
point an executive decision will be made if an agreement can't be
reached. At this point, I think that is a better and fairer option
than just asserting one allocator is better than another and making
it the default.
And... we have no indication that SLQB will be worse for HPC than
SLUB ;)

I don't know if that is meant to be sarcastic, but the OLTP performance
numbers almost never get better from one kernel to the next. Actually
the trend is downward. Mainly due to bloat or new features being added.
I think that at some level, controlled addition of features that may
add some cycles to these paths is not a bad idea (what good is Moore's
Law if we can't have shiny new features? :) But on the other hand, this
OLTP test is incredibly valuable to monitor the general performance-
health of this area of the kernel.
