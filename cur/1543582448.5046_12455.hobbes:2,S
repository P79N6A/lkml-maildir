I had wanted to get it in before 2.4, but didn't quite make it.
I guess that means that, from your perspective, nfs exporting of
reiserfs remains an extra-kernel patch at least until 2.5 starts up
and the code has been tested extensively and it gets backported to
2.4, or maybe even until 2.6/3.0.  Such is life.
