Hi,
There are more and more Linux servers in business enviroments.
I want  to know something about the upper limits of the kernel.
How much RAM can be accessed by the 2.2 kernel ?
What are the upper limits of the ext2fs  can access ? 
How are the user processes managed ? Is there a limit of accessible memory for
each userd id ?
Is there a limit of open files for a user id ?
At least:
How can I manipulate kernel parameters ?
Thanks 
bernd
