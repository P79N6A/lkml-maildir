Please use two separate patches. The detection and cpuinfo display is
not related to set svm lock.

Yes, documentation would be useful. See below.

Why the check for 0x18 ???? And please can we use understandable
constants for this.
bit 3 (SVM_LOCK) controls only the writeability of bit 4 (SVME_DISABLE),
which controls whether SVM is allowed to be enabled or not. 
bit 3	bit 4
0	0	SVM can be enabled in EFER, SVME_DISABLE is writeable
1	0	SVM can be enabled in EFER, SVME_DISABLE is not writeable
0	1	SVM can not be enabled in EFER, SVME_DISABLE is writeable
1	1	SVM can not be enabled in EFER, SVME_DISABLE is not writeable
So SVM is disabled, when bit 4 is set.

SVM_LOCK is read only according to data sheet. You can set bit 4
(SVME_DISABLE) to prevent KVM or what else using that feature.
