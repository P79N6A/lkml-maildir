Looks good to me.  Only nitpicks are:
 - ps3disk_priv should probably be an inline function instead of a macro
 - ps3disk_open is not needed at all and should be removed completely.
 - please remove PS3DISK_MAJOR - and just pass 0 to register_blkdev.
   Passing 0 to get an unassigned dev_t range is the normal convention
   and giving it a suprising symbolic names makes reading the code a
   little harder.  
 - put_disk in ps3disk_remove should be done after you finished tearing
   down the device, not before
 - calling free_irq directly followed by request_irq in ps3disk_probe
   looks rather dumb.  I'd rather move the request_irq out of
   ps3stor_setup into the low-level driver.
