There are flash chip 'map' drivers which know how to enable WE lines, Vpp 
etc for various northbridges. Only the L440GX one is in the kernel so far. 
For the rest, ask on the LinuxBIOS list <linuxbios@lanl.gov>.
Unless you fancy desoldering your flash chips to replace them when, this is
firmly in the "don't try this at home, kids" category, though :)
