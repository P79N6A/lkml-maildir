Looks like your logger did not capture all the messages. Some important 
messages at the top were likely lost as a result. dmesg will have them, 
but you may have to increase the dmesg log buffer size in order to 
capture them all.
Did you press alt+sysrq+T or did all this come about as a result of the 
suspend?
