Of course not.  But I need pcmcia-cs for cardmgr and other tools.  The
modules are from 2.5.72.  I've also got a wireless card, which works
fine.
After learning about the -F flag to strace, I've been able to figure
out a little bit more about what cardmgr is doing:
3158  ioctl(4, 0xc050643c, 0x8054160)   = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
As far as I can see, this is cardmgr calling ioctl(xx, DS_BIND_REQUEST, xx),
which is defined as:
	_IOWR('d', 60, bind_info_t)

Nope, no change I'm afraid.
