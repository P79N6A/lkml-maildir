True I could use these two spare bytes to store the 2 highest bytes of the 
GFP flags. But then I'd still have some more complicated bit arithmetic in the 
hot code paths of the page allocator to wedge these bits into the gfp 
flags.

Right now I think it could just work by simply not swapping for 
constrained allocations. Do an agressive zone_reclaim that writes out 
potentially dirty pages if needed. But that is a significant change of 
memory allocation behavior. Maybe that would need some kind of option 
during bind that would then set something in the gfp_flags that would then 
trigger the agressive zone_reclaim?
