Is there a zerocopy receive implementation in Linux? I know that FreeBSD
5.0-CURRENT has such an implementation named zerocopy sockets and when used
with a Alteon Tigon II NIC with header splitting turned on in Firmware,
works well. Do we have any such implementation in Linux? Any reponse is
greatly appreciated ...
Thanks
Manish
