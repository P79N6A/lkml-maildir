Doesn't matter where they come from.

Your concrete example is a good one.  Where did that
filename come from?  It would seem to have come from the
keyboard via a tty (or simulator) which also had to display
it.  I'd say this is an argument for the terminal to display
UTF-8 and convert intput into UTF-8.  That is something that
seems to be not consistantly done as yet.  Ultimately it
seems to be a responsiblity of the user interface, whether
tty or GUI.  Until that happens the shells might be able to
fill the gap, however poorly.
Perhaps the utilities that don't attempt to interpret
filenames should treat filenames exactly like the kernel
does.

Then if there is incorrect behavior is it the shell, tty or perl that is
getting things wrong here.

I'll buy that.  Then the first question to ask is "what is
the correct forum for resolving this".
