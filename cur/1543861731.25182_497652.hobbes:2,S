yes. The freezer does the fundamentally right thing: it stops all tasks 
in user-space or waits for them to return back to user-space to stop 
them there, or if it's a pure kernel-space task it waits until that 
kernel-space task voluntarily stop.
Once the system is in such a state, and all processing has been stopped, 
all of the kernel's data structures are completely 'unused', and we can:
- patch the kernel freely (kprobes)
- save+stop the kernel (sw-suspend) 
- remove a CPU (CPU hotplug and suspend)
- (We could also use this mechanism to live-migrate the kernel to 
   another system btw., possibly useful for containers)
- (We could also use this mechanism to create a live snapshot of a 
   running kernel, together with an LVM snapshot of filesystem state, 
   for possible restore point later on.)
It is a very powerful mechanism that has really nice properties - we 
should work on this one shared infrastructure instead of adding zillions 
of per-subsystem CPU hotplug locks.
