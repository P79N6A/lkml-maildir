A single zone is not used only for one thing, period. In my previous
email I enlighted the only conditions under which a reserved pool can
avoid a deadlock.

try_to_free_pages has an huge stacking under it, bounce
bufferes/loop/nbd/whatever being just some of them.

you don't even need irq to still deadlock.

The "garbage" is just an heuristic to allow atomic allocation to work in
the common case dynamically. Anything deadlock related cannot rely on
pages_min.
I am talking about fixing the thing, of course I perfectly know you can
hide it pretty well, but I definitely hate those kind of hiding patches.

I don't think so.
