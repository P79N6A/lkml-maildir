I'd like 3-digit PID numbers on my personal system. They are easy
to remember and easy to type.

There are currently 11 columns for COMMAND in "ps l" output.
There would be only 1 column with 31-bit PID numbers.
All login shells would look like "-", and all swapped out
processes would look like "[". ROTFL... no thanks dude!
Who actually needs this? If someone has hit a 32767-process limit
by design (not be fork bomb), speak up. Would 99999 be enough?
