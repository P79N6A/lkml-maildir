kjournald will not participate in writing to swapfiles.
The situation where we would need this feature is where the loop driver is
involved in the path-to-disk.  But I doubt if that's a thing we'd want to
support.
otoh there may be other kernel threads which are a saner thing to have in
the swapout path and which we do want to support.  md_thread, perhaps?
