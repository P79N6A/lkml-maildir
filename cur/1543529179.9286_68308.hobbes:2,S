No if you don't know there will be another near request as soon as the
current one gets completed.

Right (or more carefully: _possible_). For example that's obviously
wrong if the long seek moves in another disk (raid hardware for example)
and it may be wrong for some hardware but as said I was just supposing
to learn the holdoff time with lowlevel blockdevice interaction.

As just said readahead(read(2))/readaround(pageins) by design doesn't need
such logic at all. They instead invalidate the benefit of that heuristic.
The heuristic make sense only where we can give an hint and where we can't
do readahead/readaround and that's the case of the indirect blocks. And
even the indirect blocks case is an issue only during startup in only
patological cases, then - once the indirect blocks are in cache - that's not
an issue anymore and so it doesn't even look like a real issue to me if you
have enough memory to take the very-hot informations in cache.

The pagein has to discover where the binary data block is. To do that you
may have to follow indirect blocks. So really the heuristic can fit inside
pageins too.
For the binary _data_, the readaround takes care of that, and the indirect
blocks are going to be read only at once anyway as said above (and really
binaries are usually too short to need to fault on lots of level of
indirections so the heuristic is not going to help pageins at all).

That's my whole point. If you fix the fs the heuristic is not necessary
anymore.

You are definitely talking about 2.2.x. 2.3.x recognizes pageins and puts
them at the top of the queue despite of the background I/O. Try and give
me testcases (instead of words :) if that's not true. Interactiveness is
just fine in 2.3.49 (on IDE at least) as far I can tell.
The reason in 2.3.49 you are not getting the bad seek behaviour you are
worried about is thanks to readahead/around and thanks to the cache that
let us to fault in the indirection blocks only once in a while.
Again: if you have real life seek problems with 2.3.49 let me know and I'll
be glad to work to fix them, but I currently don't buy the holdoff time
betweek large seeks as a solution for the seeks since it would harm
too much the common case and for the indirect blocks with fs interaction case
it seems not worty enough. I can certainly change idea in the future if real
life prove I am wrong, but that's my current opinion with the picture I have
in mind.
Thanks.
Andrea
