Actually, ALSA is broken in that respect - it isn't portable as it
stands.  It isn't the API which is broken - it's ALSA which is broken.
Performing virt_to_page() on any non-direct mapped RAM page (which
means the value returned from dma_alloc_coherent or pci_alloc_consistent)
is undefined.
One of my current projects is fixing this crap in ALSA.
Besides, returning an invalid struct page will lead to Bad Things(tm)
in set_pte().
