I was suspecting disk seeking because increasing the number of jobs
(beyond the number of cores) would help. But I really didn't take the
actual kernel building system into consideration. And I do know that ATA
disk seek performance is ehrrmm... suboptimal and absolutely not related
to interface speed or even straight read-from-disk speed. I was hoping
fiddling with the i/o scheduler and readahead knobs would make _some_
difference here.
Interesting fact btw, that if I kick one of the disks out of the mirror,
the kernel building time remains more or less the same. So it looks like
the md mirror theory doesn't have that great impact on practise.
Anyway thank for the clues.
