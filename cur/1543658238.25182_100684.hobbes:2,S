vfork and clone do not work at all with sysenter due to user stack issues.
We should document that (it's already de-facto documented in glibc, but it 
should be explicitly documented somewhere).
Btw, the vfork/clone problems aren't sysenter-specific per se: they are 
really a generic problem with any non-inlined system call mechanism. In 
particular, vfork() really cannot afford to have a stack frame.

Yes. Although I don't see why it should matter, really.
