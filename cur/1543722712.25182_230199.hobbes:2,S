All the suggested benefits listed above could easily be implemented in a 
script.  For instance, one could design a script that checks the amount 
of disk space at logout.  If the amount of disk space remaining is less 
than X (where X is value predefined by an administrator), the script 
could _suggest_ that corrective action be taken and allow the *user* to 
_decide_ what he/she wants to delete/move.
In a workstation environment, my honest opinion is that quota's are set 
entirely too low if you're running that close to your limit.  On a 
server, I do not see deleting files at the decision of the OS, to be 
beneficial.  Nor do I see any reason to develop the suggested FS to 
implement what should be taken care of by a knowledgeable administrator.
The idea of an elastic file system is interesting until you start 
considering how it would be implemented and what affects it would have 
in a production environment.
