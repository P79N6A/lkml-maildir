But I am!!!
Sharing the page cache is more important to me than sharing disk
space.  Disk space is cheap, but increasing memory beyond 1GiB in my
notebook is not and 1GiB is too little, so memory is the real
constraint.
And it looks like Pavel already found the solution.  Whenever doing
something fishy that would confuse the page cache, we
1. lock
2. invalidate page cache for all files belonging to that cow entity
3. copyfile(), write(), or whatever
4. unlock
This is always possibly, because page cache for cow-files is never
read-write.  If it was, we would have done 1-4 before and now have a
regular (non-cow) file.
Did I miss something?
