Subject: bsd accounting lockups on smp 2.6.x machines

i originally reported kernel oopses and locks here against 2.6.1:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107488761716255&w=2
then another person reported it against 2.6.2:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107697407107875&w=2
i just saw it happen against 2.6.3, but i couldn't capture an
oops.  it's still out there.  does anyone have any leads on what
causes it?  disabling  bsd accounting seems to aleviate the
crashes.
running tomcat's stop script (java processes) triggers it at
times for me.
