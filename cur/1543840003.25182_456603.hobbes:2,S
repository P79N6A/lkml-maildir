Are you sure about signals? I thought about that, but they generally
fall into two categories: signals that have to be signals (i.e. SIGILL,
SIGABRT, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV, etc.) and signals that should be replaced a
queued event notification (SIGALRM, SIGRTMIN-SIGRTMAX).
Of course, that leaves things like SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, etc. so,
uh, nevermind then. Signal redirection to event queues is definitely
needed.

There's a handful of little test apps at
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/archive/kevent/
 , but they don't work
with the current iteration of the interface. I don't know if there are
others somewhere else.
