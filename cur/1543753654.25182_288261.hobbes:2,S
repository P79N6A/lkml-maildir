The concern is the following: you are using class_simple and
class_device structure is embedded into input_dev structure. When you
unregister input_dev class_simple_release will attempt to kfree()
memory occupied by class_device which is bad because it was never
kalloc()ated.
For now, if you continue using class_simple (which is I believe right
solution for now, we have issues with lifetime rules there and it will
take time to resolve everything), you need to dynamically allocate
class_device for input_dev (change cdev to *cdev).
