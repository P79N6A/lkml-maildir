Subject: [PATCH] serial: initialize spinlock for port failed to setup console
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It seems serial_core intend to initialize port->lock just once for
each ports.  This is done in uart_set_options() for console, and in
uart_add_one_port() for other ports.  But there is a case the
port->lock is not initialized by serial_core.  If the setup function
for the console was failed, it will not call uart_set_options() but
the port is marked as console (uart_console(port) returns 1).  It can
happen if console was PCI port which can not detected at the time of
register_console.
This patch is to initialize port->lock for such console port.  With
this change, most of spin_lock_init() (some of them are labeled
"Temporary fix.") in low-level serial drivers can be omitted.
