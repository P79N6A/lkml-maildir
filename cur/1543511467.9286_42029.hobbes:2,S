Wasn't there a change made in the module interface or something
between 2.2.10 and 2.2.11, requiring all 3rd party modules to be
updated ? Or was it something to do with the wait queues..
I remember something changing which was quite widespread throughout
modules.
This could also explain the problems I'm having with the SB Live,
as that module is for 2.2.10 also.
regards,
Dave.
