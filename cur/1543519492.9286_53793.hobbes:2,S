Hi to all. First sorry of my bad English. In Science Center Petnica in
Yugoslavia I worked on algorithm called "Detecting of memory leaks using
static pointer analysis", and I want to ask you this: Where can I find some
books about programming Linux kernel and fixing some mistakes in it
(especially in memory leaks). I did some source in debuggers for C language
and right now there are working. I want to improve more my algorithm and to
use it with kernel.
Best regards,
Milos
