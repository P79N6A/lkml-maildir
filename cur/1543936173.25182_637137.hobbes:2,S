btw., that's not to suggest that WC does not have its place - but it's 
not where you think it is.
Write-Combining can be very useful for devices that are behind a slow or 
a high-latency transport, such as PCI, and which are mapped UnCached 
today. Such as a networking card (or storage card) descriptor rings. New 
entries in the TX ring are typically constructed on the CPU side without 
knowing anything about their contents (and hence no need to read them, 
the drivers typically shadow the ring on the host side already, it is 
required for good UC performance today), so the new descriptors can be 
streamed out efficiently with WC, instead of generating lots of small UC 
accesses. But these descriptor rings have constant size, they have a 
fixed place in the aperture and are ioremap()ed once during device init 
and that's it. No high-frequency change_page_attributes() usage is done 
or desired here.
