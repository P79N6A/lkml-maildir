Another thing to consider is that the rate-limiting in
__might_sleep() hides lots of instances being reported -- or at
least it did when I removed that rate-limiting and had to wait
for 2-3 minutes for all of that scrolling to finish.
I guess that if enough people test it and give feedback, we'll see
and fix all of them eventually...
