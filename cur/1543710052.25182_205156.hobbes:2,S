Greetings folks,
    *Groans*  Do we need another revision here again?  It is pain in the butt going from ipf to ipchains and then to Iptables.  Just going over to ipfilter from Iptables is just asking for suicide among lot us if we going to be using the new filter system.
    Just improve on Iptables and stick with it. :)  I don't feel like learning another ip filtering system all over again after going though 3 changes. :)
    Although, it would be nice if we can add the natural language filtering system to the IPtables, something akin to this line:
    REJECT 32.31.38.83:80 INPUT, which make it lot easier than the IPTables setup, but it is just me wishing. :)
