You are missing two facts:
- I'm on the _crusade_ to clean drivers/ide and merge them with libata later
- pata is (slowly) going away but support for it is not going _anywhere_

It is _your_ job to do it properly.
There are no double standards, 'IDE crap embargo' holds for everyone.

I think I provided enough details few times already.
You can always ask in case of problems (keep linux-ide@ cc:-ed).
[ First thing to do is to use REQ_DRIVE_TASKFILE not REQ_DRIVE_TASK. ]
