Yes, please fix the misuse of MODALIAS.

The environment key MODALIAS= and the sysfs file 'modalias" are part of
the driver core, and have a well defined meaning. And it's a much
younger construct, and _not_ free-text.

Sure, it is. Please prefix it with "platform:".

Loops of modprobe by modules requesting itself, you worked around that
in the recent kernel, but that broke other setups. And module-init-tools
"blacklist" does not work, because platform uses no alias, but a plain
driver name. That should be fixed, please, please, please...
Every distro has problems with platform, and believe me, I as the udev
maintainer, get all the questions and the trouble. Some blacklist the
whole platform event, some only a few devices. All just because platform
thinks it must not follow the rules everybody else plays. Please,
please, please do what everybody else is doing with the driver core.
Thanks again,
Kay
