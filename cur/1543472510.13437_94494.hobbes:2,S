Isn't that the same technique used to write software licenses?
Less a license, more a store of legal ammunition.

Basically this is real competition.  If you can figure out how
company A did something, you are free to copy or innovate.  If you
copy, you are unlikely to unseat them without resorting to illegal
tactics like dumping, etc.  Your best choice is to innovate something
better, and that is far more beneficial to the market.
