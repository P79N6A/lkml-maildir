Hello,
I'd like to extract the (virtual) memory page sequences
referenced by a given process. Do you have any idea how I could
manage this? Is it possible at least? I have i386 hardware, if
this is important...
(I intend to study the behaviour of programs corncerning memory
usage, eg. their typical reference sequences (if any).)
TIA,
Gabor
