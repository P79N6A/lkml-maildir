I have successfully used the vesafb with a geforce4 based card on 2.4.18
kernel, so I assume it should work on 2.4.19 too unless your hardware
does something nasty
AFAIK there is no accelerated fb driver for geforce4 in 2.4
linux-fbdev-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailinglist can probably provide
more answers
