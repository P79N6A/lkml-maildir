Which could well be empty, which in turn puts one back in the position
of dealing with a newborn cpuset that is empty (of cpus or of memory),
or else it introduces a new and odd constraint on when cpusets can be
created (only when there are non-exclusive cpus and mems available.)

I wasn't paying close enough attention to understand why you couldn't
do it in two steps - make the container, and then populate it with
resources.
But if indeed that's not possible, then I guess we need some sort of
option specifying whether to create kids empty, or inheriting.
