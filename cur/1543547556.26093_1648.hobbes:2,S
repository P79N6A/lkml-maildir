Does it flush the CPU cache?  I thought the CPU just snooped the bus and
updated its cache with new data.

Ugh.  User space DMA gets complicated quickly.  The performance question
is, perhaps, can you do this without a TLB flush (but with locking the
struct page of course).  Note that it doesn't matter if another thread,
and this includes truncate/write in another thread, clobbers the page
data.  That's just the normal effect of two concurrent writers to the
same memory.
