For this patch to be safe we need to 
A) Fix sysv shm to use the swap cache.
B) garantee that shrink_mmap is the only place that
   removes a page from the swap cache, and that it never removes
   a page while I/O is in progress, (as Stephen said).
This means a lot of the current cases like delete_from_swap_cache,
and free_page_and_swap_cache need to be removed.
And we need to be very carefull when we break down the swap cache,
and make it an unshared page.
The change to normally remove pages with shrink_mmap is what makes it
mostly safe now.
For 2.3 it should go.  For 2.2 it should stay.
