I'm a bit confused about what you're saying here.  What does the 'vector'
in all these expressions mean?
In OO terminology our *_operation structures are interfaces.  Each particular
instance of such a struct that is filled with function pointers is a class.
Each instance of an inode/file/dentry/superblock/... that uses these operation
vectors is an object.
What I propose (or rather demand ;-)) is that you don't duplicate this
infrastructure, and add another dispath layer below these objects but instead
re-use it for what it is done and only handle things specific to reiser4
in your own code.
