I cannot tcpdump the other side, sorry... but I think you could be
right:

...yes, I am pinging the router every minute and since then the network
is working flawlessly. So... bridge problem? Or the "gc_min_interval" 
suggestion can matter? Note: this not a server, routing is static, ip
load is very low.  The other machine is a network server and never has
problem... but this could be understandable, I see now, if the problem
is that the bridge "forgets" to bridge...

the first two entries are "behind" the switch. The tird is directly
connected via an hub. (A subnote: switch and bridge are the same
beast, or not?)
