PowerPC is unique in that it actually relies on the declarations
in include/{linux,asm}/syscalls.h to be present, because the
spu_syscall_table is generated from C code, not from assembly.
One reason why I did this was to be sure to find this exact
type of problem at compile-time, not at link time.
