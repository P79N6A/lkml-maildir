A new pgdir is allocated on resume that does not overlap with any pages
being restored. See relocate_pagedir() in the code..
We assume that the kernel version is the same, and therefore that the code
and static data are in same locations in memory. So, even if the kernel
page tables get overwritten, we can still access the pointer to the pgdir.
