I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this, but if there is a
better place, please let me know.
Most new motherboards these days comes with health monitoring devices,
temperature, CPU fan speed, etc.
Where can I find information/drivers/utils for monitoring the health of
such systems in linux.
I have also heard about high range systems with redundant
power-supplies, and they have the ability to monitor if one powersupply
fails. Any information in regards to linux's capibilities on that would
be very helpful.
I'm looking at providing a linux box that will be in a remote
enviourment, and it needs to look after itself, and report any problems
that it detects.
Thanks for your help,
Nick
A CC of any replies to my email address would be greatly appreciated.
