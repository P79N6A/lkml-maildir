It will deadlock if the user does something braindead like:
	rmmod foo < /sys/class/foo_class/foo1/file
Now I know the network code can handle something like that, but they
have their own thread to handle issues like this...  It's not sane to
make every driver subsystem do that...
So in short, it's used to make sure that all references are dropped,
before allowing the module to be unloaded.
And Alan, I think Pat already has this in his tree, if only he would
send that to Linus one of these days...
thanks,
