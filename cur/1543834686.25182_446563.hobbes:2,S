Sure, but detecting if /dev/rtc via mmap is faster than gettimeofday is an
orthogonal issue to having the choice in the first place.  I say let the X guys
write code to determine at run time what is more efficient to get their job
done.  I really just wanted to give them the ability to avoid making a million
kernel traps a second for those arches where a userspace gettimeofday is not
yet implemented, or cannot be implemented.  It won't cost anything to add this
feature, and if the Xorg people can write code to use gettimeofday if its faster
than mmaped /dev/rtc (or even configured to do so at compile-time).  This patch
doesn't create any interrupts that wouldn't be generated already anyway by any
user using /dev/rtc, and even if X doesn't already use /dev/rtc, the added
interrupts are in trade for an equally fewer number of kernel traps, which I
think has to be a net savings.
I'm not saying we shouldn't implement a vsyscall on more platforms to provide a
speedup for this problem (in fact I'm interested to learn how, since I hadn't
previously considered that as a possibility), but I think offering the choice is
a smart thing to do until the latter solution gets propogated to other
arches/platforms besides x86_64
