The general answer is the backports are small and easy.  I don't test them 
heavily, and I don't go out of my way to make things work. 
But, they do make it easier for people to try out, and to figure how to use 
all these new features to solve problems.  Small changes that enable more 
testers are always welcome.
In general, the core parts of the kernel that btrfs uses haven't had many 
interface changes since 2.6.18, so this isn't a huge deal.
