I think so. Check my mail from 11:14:56 GMT today. I fully understand
that if I supply less data to the device than it expects or get less
from it than it has, it'll be a problem. But I think the specification
doesn't prohibit reading amounts not divisible by multimode setting via
the multimode command. I've read it quite carefully again.
