Ahh thanks, the comments at the top of the file confused me:
 * SNI specific PCI support for RM200/RM300.
I have no opinion on the codes deletion or not. I'm simply changing all
occurances of pci_find_device. Hopefully people will not confuse that
work with my having any familiarity with the actual devices themselves :)
Thanks a lot.
