I first tried -mm1 with AGP disabled, but when I did /sbin/init 5, I got
into a dialog about selecting a different X server, so I elected not to
do that right now.  I re-enabled AGP and disabled DRM, and -mm1 rebooted
as before when "Log Out" was selected.  As a preliminary test, I had
started X with startx, and that worked fine on logout as before.
Sorry, but I'm running out of time for more testing today.  I'll try
again tomorrow when I have more time.
