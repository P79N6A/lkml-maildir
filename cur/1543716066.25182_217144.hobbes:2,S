I don't thinks so. The idle_cpu_mask isn't dependent on the
no hz timer feature. I think it would make sense to set the
bits in idle_cpu_mask even on system that use the normal hz timer.
The tricky part is to find a way to clear the bits again after
a wakeup interrupt. This needs to be done before the interrupt
function is executed, you can't do it in idle().
