Subject: Where's the bzip2 compressed linux-kernel patch?

I just rewrote bunzip2 for busybox in about 500 lines of C (and a good chunk 
of that's comments), which comiles to a bit under 7k, and I was thinking of 
redoing the bunzip-the-kernel patch with my new bunzip code, but I can't find 
the patch.  Anybody got a URL to it?
The most recent one I could find was kerneltrap's 404-error link to 
http://chrissicool.piranho.com/patch-2.4.x-bzip2-i386

P.S.  If you're curious about the micro-bunzip code, it's in busybox CVS:
