Hi,
  I just left my 2.5.44 box unattended for hour and half, and when
I came back, I saw very strange things on screen:
Debug: sleeping function called from illegal context at include/asm/semaphore.h:119

 <0>Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
It looks to me like that system first complained a bit about some
spinlock being held, panicked in schedule, and then it printed
very strange oopses: they look like userspace CPU context.
Kernel is 2.5.44, compiled for SMP, running on machine with 1 CPU.
Before this incident machine was up for about 60 hours.
After reboot fsck found 31 deleted inodes with zero dtime.
                                                Thanks,
