Seems to be ide probe calling the pci probe functions, and then they get
called by the pci layer later when they register. Dunno what the best
way to handle this is. Alan quotes ordering constraints as the reason.
Then maybe the easiest fix is to just do
chipset_init(bla)
{
	if (chipset already setup)
		return;
	do_init();
}
Alan?
