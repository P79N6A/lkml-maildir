No, this is NOT correct behaviour.  Please read the pages at:
http://home.tiscalinet.de/au-ja/review-kt133a-1-en.html
 (and especially
click on "Bugfix for everybody"); this URL is in the code.  You will note
that it is explicitly stated that this fix is NOT meant for any other
Northbridge than VIA.  So, in short, if there is no BIOS update available
for your board, you're going to have to some more research.  The PCI
registers that are configured could have a totally different (and even
dangerous) effect on your configuration.
