Building old kernels with the latest gcc has never worked [1].
First of all, gcc 4.3 is still one year away from being released, so 
there's zero urgency.
And considering that compile errors are the trivial things, and the real 
problems are new runtime errors caused by incorrect kernel code combined 
with gcc optimization [2] I'd even consider backporting only the compile 
fixes before the real issues have been shaken out a bad idea.

[1] the backported gcc 4 support in kernel 2.4 is an exception
[2] look e.g. at commit 8690ba446defe2e2b81803756c099d2943dfd5fd
