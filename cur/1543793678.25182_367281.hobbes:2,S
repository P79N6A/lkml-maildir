Just a heads up - After some lame hacking I finally have got the trackpad on the PB5,8  (15" Late Oct 2005) to work. 
Ok, here is the current definition of working - mouse moves but for that you have to roll over on the trackpad ;)!
Currently negotiating with it so that it's happy with the fingers!! :D
Will post the modified source once for appletouch once it starts working acceptably.
