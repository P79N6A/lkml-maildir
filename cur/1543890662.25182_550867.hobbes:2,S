I guess you mean drivers/usb/gadget/file_storage.c
	fsg_main_thread:
		siginitsetinv(&fsg->thread_signal_mask, SIGTERM | ...);
		sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &fsg->thread_signal_mask, NULL);
Yes?
Please look at
	change kernel threads to ignore signals instead of blocking them
	commit: 10ab825bdef8df510f99c703a5a2d9b13a4e31a5
I think you can convert the code above to use allow_signal().
Please note that it is not good to just unblock the signal, SIG_DFL means
that __group_complete_signal() starts doing SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT things. In
particular, SIGTERM implies sigaddset(SIGKILL).
Oleg.
