The overhead of timer interrupts at this low clockrate is significant
so I recommend to minimize the timer interrupt rate as far as possible.
This is really a tradeoff between latency and overhead and matters
much less on hardcores which run at hundreds of MHz.  For power sensitive
applications lowering the interrupt rate can also help.  And that's alredy
pretty much what you need to know, that is a 10ms  timer is fine.
Btw, is this coincidentally on a CoreFPGA 2 or 3 CPU card on a Malta board?
