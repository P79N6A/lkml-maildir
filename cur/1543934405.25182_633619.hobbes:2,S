It does seem that it might be a good goal to revisit options marked
EXPERIMENTAL, and see if they still should be marked as such, rather
than removing the option altogether.
init/Kconfig describes things in "EXPERIMENTAL" as "alpha-test" - I bet
there are a few things which have moved beyond this, but are still
marked as such.
