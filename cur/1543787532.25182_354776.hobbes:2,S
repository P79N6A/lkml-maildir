Well, I have that ugly workaround that helps me, but is wrong (as rmk
confirmed). His comment was:
|> Sep 29 15:42:34 amd kernel: Call Trace:

|Looking at release_dev(), it does things in the following order:
|
|1. various sanity checks
|2. close the driver
|3. more sanity checks and other housekeeping
|4. close the ldisc
|5. reset the ldisc for the tty to N_TTY
|
|This means that bluetooth is calling into a TTY driver with a tty
|for which the driver has already shut down.  No surprise it oopses.
|Bluetooth should not call the driver during it's closedown.
|
|(There also appears to be an interesting race condition between the
|driver shutting down and the ldisc write functions getting to know
|about it... Alan?)
But no, I do not have patch for that.
