/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq does not exist.

My kernel config file is named cpufreq.txt. The other file is the 
README.Debian file found in the kernel-source doc directory. As you can 
see, it only patches, non-free stuff and firmware mainly.
I've looked at changelogs for 2.6.9 and 2.6.10 and whilst they helped me 
correct a previous error, this problem remains.
/etc/fstab does not contain an sysfs entry, however, /etc/mtab does :) 
I'm guessing this is a debian thing, because i've seen forums all over 
the web where apparently you have to have an entry in fstab. Looks like 
i dont need one. Maybe an old feature?
