I think it was because Linux dump was (more or less) a port from the
Berkeley FFS equivalent, which did this (and furthermore, did it to
the raw device, so dumping a non-quiescent filesystem was guaranteed
to be trouble).  I'm pretty sure the BSD version did it for (a)
performance, and (b) so it could easily keep track of inode
information to make incremental restores easier (not that you couldn't 
do it with stat(), but that's yet another syscall to slow things
down).
