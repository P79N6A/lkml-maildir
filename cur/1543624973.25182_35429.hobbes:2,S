If you have a clone of the full master 2.5 repository somewhere on
your harddisk, you can go just there and do a
% bk send -r1.158 - | bk receive /your/uml/repository
After that change to your uml repository and do a
% bk resolve
to apply the 1.158 changeset to your uml repository (if you give a
"-a" option to bk receive, bk resolve will be run automatically).
