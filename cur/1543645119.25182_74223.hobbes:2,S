Linux is perfectly happy just to have you return 1 in queuecommand if the 
device won't accept the tag.  The can_queue parameter represents the maximum 
number of outstanding commands the mid-layer will ever send.  The mid-layer is 
happy to re-queue I/O below this limit if it cannot be accepted by the drive.  
In fact, that's more or less what queue plugging is about.
The only problem occurs if you return 1 from queuecommand with no other 
outstanding I/O for the device.
There should be no reason in 2.5 for a driver to have to implement an internal 
queue.
