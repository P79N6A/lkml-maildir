Yes, this is what I understood.

Yes, so now, if you take this new definition of indirect_params,
its size is 12 bytes at least.
So when you recompile your old program (as you post it and as I commented on),
it will pass a >= 12 bytes data to kernel, with only first 4 bytes set to O_CLOEXEC.
Other bytes will contain junk (automatic variables are not set to 0 by compiler), 
and your program possibly break - if kernel socket() call was
extended to use new_data struct. (ie wanting O_CLOEXEC features +
 new ones with new_syscall_data1)
You have to take care of binary compatibility, but also that an old program
 (unaware of the new fields) will be re-compiled with new headers.

Yes, sure, but it should be a kernel issue, not a user space one at all,
as long as user provides the size of the data he want to pass to kernel (
and your patch does this already)
