I think it's kind of FAQ. Have a thread waiting in your driver
with add_wait_queue and schedule(). When awoken, the even thread
can signal the main worker thread or do the job itself.
But first, make sure you are not served better with an
event driven main thread (e.g. open a file descriptor
into your driver, then use select() on it together with
all other of your descriptors).
