No worries. Glad to help. :)
One point of note though. Should this be happening?

I only have the following compiled in:
# I2C support
CONFIG_I2C=y
CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV=y
CONFIG_I2C_PROC=y
CONFIG_I2C_PIIX4=y
CONFIG_SENSORS_ADM1021=y
I trimmed things down to this through testing (I compiled in many
options and then left only the ones that appeared in
/proc/sys/dev/sensors)
