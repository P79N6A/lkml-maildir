Can we get an offset into the area as one of the args? Then scatter/gather
should be trivially constructible (via iteration) from the interface.
Maybe something like:
struct dma_scatterlist {
        dma_addr_t dma_addr;            /* DMA address */
        void *cpu_addr;                 /* cpu address */
        unsigned long length;           /* in units of pages */
};
int dma_mmap_coherent_sg(struct dma_scatterlist *sglist,
                        int nr_sglist_elements,     /* length of sglist */
                        struct vm_area_struct *vma, /* for address space */
                        unsigned long address,      /* user virtual address */
                        unsigned long offset,       /* offset (in pages) */
                        unsigned long nr_pages);    /* length (in pages) */
int dma_munmap_coherent_sg(struct dma_scatterlist *sglist,
                        int nr_sglist_elements,     /* length of sglist */
                        struct vm_area_struct *vma, /* for address space */
                        unsigned long address,      /* user virtual address */
                        unsigned long offset,       /* offset (in pages) */
                        unsigned long nr_pages);    /* length (in pages) */
int dma_alloc_coherent_sg(struct dma_scatterlist **sglist,
                        unsigned long length);      /* length in pages */
int dma_free_coherent_sg(struct dma_scatterlist **sglist,
                        unsigned long length);      /* length in pages */
Would be useful? And these in turn would drive the dma_alloc_coherent()
and helpers like:
int dma_mmap_coherent(struct vm_area_struct *vma,
                        unsigned long address,
                        dma_addr_t dma_addr,            /* DMA address */
                        void *cpu_addr,                 /* cpu address */
                        unsigned long nr_pages);        /* length (in pages) */
int dma_munmap_coherent(struct vm_area_struct *vma,
                        unsigned long address,
                        dma_addr_t dma_addr,            /* DMA address */
                        void *cpu_addr,                 /* cpu address */
                        unsigned long nr_pages);        /* length (in pages) */
Does any of this sound like it's on the right track API-wise?
My thought on attacking the scatter/gather issue is basically centered
around "they're going to try to do it anyway, and if they don't have
something there to do it for them, they'll get it wrong."
