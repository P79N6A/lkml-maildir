Review had been easier if the patch was inlined.
Took a quick look at the small Kconfig bits.
From arch/sparc64/Kconfig:
+config LMB
+       def_bool y
+
Can we plase have this changed to use:
 config SPARC64
+	select HAVE_LMB
And then in lib/Kconfig have
+config HAVE_LMB
+	bool
So we avoid creating a new variable each time we introdce LMB support.
You would need to update powerpc Kconfig too of course.
This way of doing it is documented in:
Documenation/kbuild/kconfig.language.txt
Thanks,
