I was toying around with the idea of making /proc/meminfo use KiB as
the unit instead of KB [just something to waste 10 mins] when I noticed
that you guys have prototypes like
static int meminfo_read_proc(char *page, char **start, off_t off,
				 int count, int *eof, void *data)
Then do things like
	len = sprintf(page,
Wouldn't it be safer to pass the size of "page" into the function and
use snprintf to prevent any possible buffer overflows?
Sure right now it's not a problem but it would make the code easier to
review, say when someone wants to add a /proc/thingymagingy later on in
the future.
I'm still a kernel newbie so I'll defer the coding work to other people
;-)  Just thought I would point that out.
Tom
