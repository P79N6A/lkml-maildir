  This could be part of the problem too?  I don't think I set anything
specific to get to 32bit on my system.  Hmmm, the multcount too?
I'm starting to think, if this is your output from 2.4.20-pre2-ac4 that
you're hitting a bug in the current code which is REALLY not doing the
right thing for your controller.

  Try hdparm -u1 /dev/hda

  And may as well use -d1 too if it works on the device (yes, I know you
said neither kernel enabled it per default).  Then you're after finding
which DMA mode the IDE bus and drive can do, 'man hdparm' for the
possible values (like -X69 if it's all ATA100 capable for UDMA5).
  With a 60GB Maxtor and an 80pin cable I use:
	/sbin/hdparm -u1 -d1 -X69 /dev/hda
root@emelia:~# hdparm -t -T /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.52 seconds =246.15 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.03 seconds = 31.53 MB/sec
Although I'm wondering if with ATA100 and UDMA5 I should be seeing even
better than that.
HTH,
