I have seen a motherboard that complains if /dev/hda (the primary
master IDE device) is anything other than a hard drive, and I fixed
that problem by putting the IDE tape drive on as a secondary drive (so
it would appear as /dev/hdb instead). The system in question was set
up to netboot, and doesn't have any form of hard drive in it, so
/dev/hda is unused as a result...
The system in question isn't mine, and doesn't run Linux, so I can't
comment on what Linux makes of it, but because of that experience, I
always stay clear of /dev/hda for IDE non-hard drives...
Best wishes from Riley.
