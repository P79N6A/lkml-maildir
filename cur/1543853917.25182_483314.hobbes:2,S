Hello,
With great astonishment I've found none of
these "networking" names in the CREDITS file:
Stephen Hemminger, Thomas Graf, Alexey Kuznetsov,
Andrew Morton, Pedro Roque, Jamal Hadi Salim,
Herbert Xu etc.
IMHO there is something wrong with the hitherto
way of updating this file and probably some
additional work should be done regularly by kernel
supervisors. Otherwise the name of this file
should be changed to not discredit many current
and in particular previous developers.
Many thanks and regards
to myself,
Jarek P.
