Then you see something I don't see.  For example there are quite a few
recursions with some function like
void foo(int depth)
{
	if (!depth) {
		bar(1);
	}
	...
}
bar will, maybe through several more functions call foo(1).
How can you say that foo will beak this recursion after two rounds
max?  What if a changed bar decrements the depth value?  The recursion
will run for infinity now, won't it?  And whoever changed bar doesn't
have a clue that he now fucked up your comment to foo.
I claim:
There is no way to tell the depth of any recursion without looking at
all involved functions.
Prove me wrong, please.
