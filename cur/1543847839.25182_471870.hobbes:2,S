I agree with that. But the printk can't go in until all the in-tree
users are converted. I will  get around to doing that once the
interface is firmer.
As for timeframe, I don't have any strong feelings, but 6 months might
only be 1 kernel release, and we may not have got around to putting the
printk in yet ;)
