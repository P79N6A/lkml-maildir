No.  In the latter case, there is no userspace daemon.  As there are no
dentries, filenames and paths in CacheFS, keeping track of the cull table
consumes a less space than for CacheFiles.
You start the cache by mounting it:
	mount -t cachefs /dev/hdx9 /cachefs
Then it's online.  However, you might want to check that whoever's calling
mount has permission to bring a cache online...
Actually, I think the permission to bring a cache online applies in all cases,
and is probably separate from checking that CacheFiles(d) is permitted to
mangle the filesystem it's using for a cache.  With CacheFS, we could do the
equivalent and do a MAC check to make sure we're permitted to read and write
the blockdev, as you suggest in the next bit:

So, to summarise, is it worth having two checks:
 (1) Permission to bring a cache online or to take a cache offline.
 (2) Permission for the process bringing the cache online (cachefilesd or
     mount) to access the backing store, be it a set of files and directories,
     or be it a blockdev.
