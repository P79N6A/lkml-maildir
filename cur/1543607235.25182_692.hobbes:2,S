I have replied to this person personally a when this thread started with what I
think is the fix to his problem.  I have seen this error on my machine before.
The problem arose when I compiled the running kernel with gcc-3.0.  At first I
thought it was just gcc-3 breaking the kernel.  Then I realized that the nvidia
modules use `cc` to compile.  The symlink to cc was gcc-2.95.  Changing the
symlink to gcc-3.0 made the problem go away.
