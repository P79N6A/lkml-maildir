/proc/sysconf will never be able to handle non-kernel configuration
settings.  Linus mentioned settings for 'bc' and 'expr' and I don't want
to teach these to a kernel.
In addition, you want the administrator to be able to add more settings
that the company needs, such as build type, location and country.
The interface I would expect to see in a large corporation:
- There is a build machine used to build special kernels.
  If we need maxgroups 256, fine, compile a special kernel for that
  enterprise.
- As machines are built using that special kernel, the administrators 
  ensure /etc/sysconf has the proper values. 
Ans yes, the kernel parts of this could be done using kernel support
(which is bloat).  All other aspects need admin attention anyway, you
might as well make that consistent.
