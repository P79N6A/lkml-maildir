Linus's incremental min will protect ZONE_DMA in the same manner.

It is possible to mlock 700M of the normal zone on a 4G -aa kernel.
I can't immediately think of anything apart from vma's which will
make it fall over, but it will run like crap.

It does not appear to be an important fix at all.  There have been
zero reports of it on any mailing list which I read since the google
days.
Yes, it needs to be addressed.  But it is not worth taking 100 megabytes
of pagecache away from everyone.  That is just a matter of choosing
the default value.
2.5 has much bigger problems than this - radix_tree nodes and pte_chains
in particular.
