Hi,
on a Thinkpad 600X I noticed the CPU getting very hot. It turned
out that pm_idle was never called (which invokes the ACPI pm_idle
call in this case) and default_idle was used instead.
	/* arch/i386/kernel/process.c, line 723 */
	void cpu_idle (void)
	{
		/* endless idle loop with no priority at all */
		while (1) {
			void (*idle)(void) = pm_idle;
			if (!idle)
				idle = default_idle; /* once on bootup */
			irq_stat[smp_processor_id()].idle_timestamp = jiffies;
			while (!need_resched())
				idle();
			schedule();  /* never reached */
		}
	}
The schedule() is never reached (need_resched() is never 0) and
so the idle-variable is not updated. pm_idle is NULL on the
first call to cpu_idle on this thinkpad, and so I stay idling
in the default_idle()-function.
By moving the "void *idle = pm_idle; if(!idle)..." in the inner
while()-loop the notebook calls pm_idle (as it get's updated by ACPI)
and stays cool.
