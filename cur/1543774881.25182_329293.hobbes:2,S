Subject: [GIT PATCH] PCI patches for 2.6.12
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/28/19

Here are a bunch of PCI patches against your latest git tree, and even a
merge (hey, it was my first, I was happy it all worked out ok...).  They
include:
	- acpi pci hotplug driver updates and reworks.
	- dma bursting help for drivers
	- msi minor cleanups
	- MCFG acpi table parsing for pci busses
All of these patches have been in the -mm tree for the past few months.
I have not included any of the pci patches in the -mm tree that were
causing people problems.  Those are still being worked on to get
correct.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-kernel and linux-pci mailing
lists, if anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
