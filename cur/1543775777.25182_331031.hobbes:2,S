You have to wait for the current command to finish, that is the fastest
approach. Aborting it would likely take longer. So what I describe
above, is really as fast as you can issue that command. If you are busy
doing io (writes, from the sound of the above), a single command doesn't
take very long as it goes to cache. Lets just say 10ms as a nice
pessimistic number. On average, that means you have 5ms until that
command finishes and you can issue the park. Submitting the park command
doesn't take long, the time is dominated by the actual park time. Which
is hardware bound, there's not much we can improve there in software.
The actualy accel daemon would run at an appropriate scheduling
priority/class, to ensure good response there.
