Yes, I agree that X may be in the way.  It is also possible, if you are
logging in via telnet or some other remote service that the I/O service
tasks don't have the needed priority.
My solution for X is to bump its priority too.
Attached, find rt, a program to allow you to change the priority of any
task, and getrt a simple reporting program to get the priority of any
task.
By the way, if you have a relatively secure system, and you want to use
telnet, you can set the priority of inetd.  This way all the I/O
services and the resulting session are boosted in priority.  You must do
this ahead of time, after your task goes into a loop, its too late to
boost anything, but once you do this, you should be able to telnet into
the machine even if your task is "lost" in some loop.
