I applied the acpi-dock patch that I specified, and that patch only, and
i'm getting errors building:
drivers/acpi/dock.c: In function 'dock_notify':
drivers/acpi/dock.c:543: error: 'KOBJ_DOCK' undeclared (first use in
this function)
drivers/acpi/dock.c:543: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported
only once
drivers/acpi/dock.c:543: error: for each function it appears in.)
drivers/acpi/dock.c:562: error: 'KOBJ_UNDOCK' undeclared (first use in
this function)
Is there something else I need to apply that I am missing?
Thanks!
George
