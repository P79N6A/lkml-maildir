Hello:
When I moved from 2.4.0-test5 to 2.4.0-test6 (pre1 and now pre2) I lost the ability to run the 'man' command as an ordinary user. When running the command (e.g., "man man") I get an error that I am unable to set effective user ID, and permission denied.
I am using Debian Woody on Intel. Any details needed, I can supply.
Hope this is of help,
