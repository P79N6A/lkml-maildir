I'll post some more benchmarks, but I have found that loads with
lots of IO streams. Those with more than about 1/2 as many IO streams
as request slots start to show improvements. I don't think changing
the size of the queues on the fly would be any good. They can be
made runtime tunable quite easily now, which is a good bad solution.
