Yes, that's probably right.  In fact the hw_unavailable flag exists
specifically to stop orinoco_interrupt() and others doing anything
worse than giving a warning if called at this sort of time.  It would
certainly be bad to go ahead and access the hardware at this point.
We've already cleared the INTEN register at this point, so we're not
expecting to get an interrupt.  But I guess that interrupt line is
shared with something else.
In the long time that warning should probably disappear (we should
just do nothing safely and silently).  For now it is still usful for
tracking down real problems.

I think that's correct.

I suspect this may be another PCMCIA rather than orinoco problem,
although I'm not sure.  If it's happening in the orinoco driver, I
have no idea where it could be - I've generally been careful to have
timeouts and checks to handle the device suddenly disappearing.
Do you get a hang if you ifconfig down the interface, but don't
cardctl eject the card?  I've also heard that some PCMCIA hardware
can't reliably cope with hot unplug like this.

:-( this sounds like one of the perennial problems we've had with some
cards.  The firmware falls over, and I haven't been able to figure out
what we've done to upset it.
