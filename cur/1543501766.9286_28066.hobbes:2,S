Apparently "GUI lusers" can't use archiving tools.
Which is no big deal for copying, but a pain when they want to attach
a "compound document" to an email using they're old favourite mailer.
I do think it's worth having compound documents _as files_ one way or
another.

You forgot one:
  - I'd like to invoke "gimp my_document/picture_number_1" without
    having to "export" the image first and "import" it back after
    editing.
    This sort of thing will work fine in a good compound document
    application framework -- and one of those is required anyway for
    cross-platform support.  It would just be _nice_ to be able to
    dig into a document without having to use the framework.

You've shown why it must be implement in user space, that's all.  It
could have kernel support by way of _efficiency_ and _convenience_.
Since we like to keep things orthogonal here, if there are any kernel
changes, best to keep them independent of compound document frameworks
that we may have in mind.

It already moves directories :-)

Good for you.  I don't want to fire up the word processor -- it might
take ages to load the 35 fonts etc. which I'm not actually interested in
looking at.
Look at it this way: when you want to change the logo on your web pages,
do you load up Netscape Composer first?  No, you just get on and edit
the image.
As for API: I'm for having the components as _separate_ files in
directories.  Let the "convenience" features of libc/kernel hacks make
it appear as a file, but let the underlying thing be a directory.  On
other systems it will always look like a directory.
People seem quite happy with this for web pages.

This is the standardisation problem.  A big part of this discussion is
about "compound documents", which require a number of different
applications to edit them.  Web pages with inline images are probably
the best example.  Presentations with graphs built from tiny
spreadsheets are another (the presentation document contains a diagram
component which contains a spreadsheet).

I think this is a great idea also.  It does have to be cross-platform
first and foremost.

Hold on, what if the "standard format" is a directory full of files?  As
is so often the case for a web page?
