That's a bit nicer, that way you don't have to declare it twice, but
it's not a big deal either way (no style rule here :)

No, they can be static, and they should, to keep the namespace a bit
cleaner.  The pointer itself isn't static, and all references to the
function goes through it, so the functions do not need to be global.

Just a "keep all #includes at the top of the file" type of thing, unless
it's absolutely necessary.
Hope this helps,
