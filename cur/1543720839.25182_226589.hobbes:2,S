You are missing the model:
To enable executable stack/heap you would:
if ((fd = open("/proc/self/NX",O_RDWR)) >= 0) {
   write(fd,"1",1);
   close(fd);
}
(disabling would be symmetric with "0")
Because this is a sequence of specific instructions (that shouldn't exist in the
default library to prevent stack return hack invocation) these instructions would
exist only in programs that want to be EX anyway.
Because it is /proc/self other tasks cannot "do it for you".
You could put together a stack image of these instructions and overflow them into
place, but if the stack/heap isn't already executable, you couldn't run them.  IF it
was already executable you wouldn't need to.
Note also that this is about old code and not new code.  In the existing model, one
"actively secures" his ELF image at compile time.  All the existing code is secure or
not with a kernel switch.  This proposal relaxes that system wide restriction.
-- The system is NX by default.
-- ELF marked PT_GNU_STACK apps are NX and are /proc/self/NX resistant.  (This is a
refinement I guess I didn't fully think about until last night.)
-- Any app that needs to be EX can leave their ELF unmarked and turn EX on and off by
tweaking this file.
-- Legacy apps can be EX enabled on a case-by-case basis with an LD_PRELOAD of a
shared library that contains the above in its __init().
So now, WINE (for instance) can put the above code in its startup system
unconditionally (since it is conditional on the presence of /proc/self/NX in the
first place) and WINE can be run on a system that is "otherwise NX".
The implementation doubles the "flag density" of the implementation because you have
to keep the ELF-set flag and the /procf/self/NX flag separately.  You would also need
to be able to alter and reload the segment descriptors in the running application.
Neither should be terribly onerous.
But now the NX kernel increases security by default even for apps that are already
existent or that cannot be recompiled due to being non-Open-Source.  This increases
both portability and security without requiring a complete rebuild of a distro.
So I would guess that this would be a "changeable default plus a hard lock" belt-and
suspenders approach to backwards compatability.
Rob.

no. This only means the 1-2 attack must be done in two steps (maybe three).
1. create the file (first buffer overflow)
2. write? (second buffer overflow - depends on whether file must have value)
3. disable NX (third)
