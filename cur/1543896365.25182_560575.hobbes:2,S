sorry if I was a bit harsh, but at least for me it wasn't clear that the 
main (and perhaps only) reasonable use case for your conditional calls 
was to get markers enabled in distribution kernels.
Please correct me, but my understanding is:
- conditional calls aim at getting markers enabled in distribution
  kernels
- markers are a valuable debugging tool
- you don't need markers during normal operation
- markers allow normal modules doing things they shouldn't be doing,
  implying that markers should _not_ be enabled in normal distribution
  kernels
