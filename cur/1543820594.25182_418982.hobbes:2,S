kref has faster function for decrement refcount.
kref_put()
{
...
	/*
	 * if current count is one, we are the last user and can release object
	 * right now, avoiding an atomic operation on 'refcount'
	 */
	if ((atomic_read(&kref->refcount) == 1) ||
		(atomic_dec_and_test(&kref->refcount))) {
		release(kref);
		return 1;
	}
If this is good one and the places where Al Viro pointed out really affect
performance, should we propagate this faster one by introducing helper
function like:
static inline int refcount_test(atomic_t *refcount)
{
	return (atomic_read(refcount) == 1) || (atomic_dec_and_test(refcount));
}
and replace atomic_dec_and_test with it?
