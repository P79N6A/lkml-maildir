Yes, but in no greater a number.

So far, however, there have been no lockups! The previous kernels would die 
very obviously within a couple of minutes.
I wonder if the ACPI problem was causing lockups (one thought I had was that 
the "ondemand" cpufreq governor was generating more ACPI events than usual, 
as the BIOS stepped through the different CPU speeds).

Well, thanks for the info. As you said, when the remaining issues have been 
resolved, I'll need to step up to a more efficient kernel, because I require 
extremely low kernel latency for the software I'm writing (this was not an 
idle patch fest).
