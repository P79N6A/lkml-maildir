And he's not doing it, the COPYING file applies for all the code which 
doesn't specifies its own license.
Notice that COPYING has this: "Also note that the only valid version of
the GPL as far as the kernel  is concerned is _this_ particular version
of the license (ie v2, not  v2.2 or v3.x or whatever),
unless explicitly otherwise stated."
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(IOW, people should care about their own code, but obviously people
usually licenses their code under the same license the project uses,
except some drivers that use a dual-license scheme etc)
