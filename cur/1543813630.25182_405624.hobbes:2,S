actually it is not that much udev but modprobe issue and modprobe already 
supports multiple modules on command line (modprobe --all, module-init-tools 
3.3.2 that I have here). So assuming module aliases cannot have embedded 
spaces and udev properly space-splits command line (I have not checked, but 
it should be the case IIRC) udev simply has to use 'modprobe --all $modalias' 
to be compatible with this patch. It also remains backwards compatible with 
single-alias modalias.
Or do I miss something obvious here? I understand that alternative is to make 
every alias appear as separate device in sysfs, but I do not know PNP 
structure well enough to decide if it makes sense.
