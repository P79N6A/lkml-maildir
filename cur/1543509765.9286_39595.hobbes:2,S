Could you tell us how big the FIFO buffers on the modem are? 
What poll frequency do you need and how much time you can miss?
My experience (sorry 2.0.37, HZ=1000) is that mlocked processes running with
RT priority can miss the deadline by more than 50 ms. Especially core dumps
of big programs are a disaster.
Try "dd if=/dev/zero of=aaa bs=10x1024k count=10"
For any hard real time only RT-Linux gives the guarantee. I think that
performance of many drivers would improve if microsecond resolution timers
with jitter typical 5 us, max 30 us would be available in the kernel.
