Ah, right - that's uswsusp isn't it? Which isn't what I'm having problems with 
AFAIK?
My suspend procedure is:
xfs_freeze -f /scratch
sync
echo platform > /sys/power/disk
echo disk > /sys/power/state
xfs_freeze -u /scratch
Which should work (actually it should work without the sync/xfs_freeze too).
So to debug the problem I'd like to minimally extend this process rather than 
replace it with another approach.
I take it there isn't an 'echo y > /sys/power/do_image_checksum'?
