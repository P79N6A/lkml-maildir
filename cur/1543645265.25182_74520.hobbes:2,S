I think if we scale slists to be like lists, we don't need to make the 
difference at all. slists are supposed to be lightweight lists, single 
direction, and working anywhere on any type of structure. (e.g. you can 
access a whole struct thread through the ->next pointer, instead of 
further crap.)
If we can avoid type dependency, we should do now. If you want inlined 
code, go read list.h. (I remember that's why the lists were called 
`type-safe', BTW. Meant to be type-preserve, and definitely the same type 
as before.)
