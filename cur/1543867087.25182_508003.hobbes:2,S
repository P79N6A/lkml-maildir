Didn't we have problems with this exact approach before? This one was dropped

http://www2.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.13/2.6.13-mm2/broken-out/x86-64-ptrace-ia32-bp-fix.patch
See:
	
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/09/16/261
for the one I proposed instead.
And in any case doesn't cstar_tracesys() need the same fix?
