Sure there is, it's a userspace program that's including kernel headers 
for one thing.. Also what makefiles are being used to compile this? You 
can't just use any old makefile on a kernel module in 2.6 and expect it 
to work properly.
Given that the kernel doesn't produce such errors in its own 
compilation, that pretty much automatically makes it the problem of the 
3rd-party code.

This has been covered time and again. If drivers don't want to be broken 
by kernel changes, the best solution is to get them included in the 
kernel source tree where they will be kept up to date automatically. And 
there is very little interest in the community in helping binary drivers 
work any better, they're not something people want to encourage, for 
good reason.
