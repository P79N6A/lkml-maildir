Something running rarely gets thrown out - It is usually only pages
that see little use that gets evicted.  Such as startup code.
Of course you can improve the situation a lot by adding swap - the kernel
will then be free to swap out dirty but little-used pages instead
of not-dirty but more used executable mappings. That will improve
your performance.
Getting more memory or running fewer programs also helps, obviously.
