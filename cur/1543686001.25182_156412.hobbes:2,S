 I'm getting this warning with gcc-3.3.1:
drivers/char/keyboard.c: In function `k_fn':
drivers/char/keyboard.c:665: warning: comparison is always true due
to limited range of data type
 gcc seems right, because the ``value'' variable only go to
255 and the size of ``func_table'' in my system is 256.
 Even if gcc transforms unsigned char to a higher in this case, its
not solve the problem, because the value in ``value'' will use only
8 bits (this is made by the K_VAL() macro).
 thanks,
PS: I'm getting this with 2.6.0-test3 too.
