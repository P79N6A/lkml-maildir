I'm already on record saying I don't think attributes in the generic
code is the right approach.  All of the attributes I can see adding are
bus specific (even to the extent that PCIe ones wouldn't apply to PCI
for instance).  I really think the right approach is to sort out the
attribute infrastructure and not try to overload the generic DMA API.  I
can certainly see that we might like to use it to take advantage of
other PCIe attributes (where available, of course).
Ultimately, it might be the best implementation course to pass the
attributes in to the dma_map routines, but I can't see them being
generic, they'd still be bus specific, so the correct way is to have a
bus specific attribute setup routine and pass some sort of opaque
attribute handle (or even just use the existing dma handle).

P.S. please update my email address: the @steeleye.com one no longer
works now.
