Subject: Print long messages to console from kernel module

I need to write messages > 1023 characters long to the console from a module*. printk() is limited to 1023 characters, and splitting the message over several printk()'s results in a line break and "Month hh:mm:ss host kernel:" being inserted in my text.
I tried including <linux/console.h> and using the console_drivers declared there, but get
"WARNING: "console_drivers" [<path>/log.ko] undefined!" when compiling and
"insmod: error inserting 'log.ko': -1 Unknown symbol in module" when insmodding.
I guess this is because non EXPORT_SYMBOL'd symbols are only accessible to statically linked code, and not to modules? I see in printk.c that console_drivers is set up there, and I haven't been able to find any other interface to console_drivers.
In short: is there any way to print messages to the console from a kernel module, except printk()? Is opening /dev/tty and writing to it the way to go?
* I'm writing an in-memory logger to be included in a module. The log can be several megabytes. The idea is to use SysRq to print the contents of the log to console after a kernel panic or otherwise when writing to disk might not work.
