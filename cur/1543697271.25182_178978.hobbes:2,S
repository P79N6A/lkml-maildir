I am guessing its more driver support, etc.  Input devices for
instance do not seem to have any sysfs support yet, and full
initramfs support with udev in there, and udev.permissions setup
to get general permissions, etc right, might make it more advertisable
for the masses (no need to maintain /dev or the initial costs for
users not so interested in the workings of things).
Lets just say from what I have seen from users talking/asking, the
initial setup and seeming 'lack of functionality' is the biggest
blocker.
