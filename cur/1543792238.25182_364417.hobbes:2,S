No no no.  (I feel sure that you will get plenty of responses.)

We can submit patches for that.
Basically (generally) we never want a struct to be typedef-ed.
(There may be a couple of exceptions to this.)
We do allow a very few basic types to be typedef-ed, as long as
the basic type (e.g., pid_t) is also a C language basic type or
the typedef is useful for strong type checking.
