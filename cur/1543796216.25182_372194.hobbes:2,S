You not supposed to see thiese messages. When you boot, what mouse type
does the kernel detect? Could you send me your dmesg please? Also, if
you could do:
1. echo 1 > /sys/modules/i8042/parameters/debug
2. Switch your KVM to another box
3. Wait 5 seconds
4. Switch back
5. Move the mouse slightly
6. echo 0 > /sys/modules/i8042/parameters/debug
... and send me dmesg I would appreciate it.

You can disable resync mode by doing:
	echo -n 0 > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX/resync_time
where serioX is serio port your mouse is connected to.
