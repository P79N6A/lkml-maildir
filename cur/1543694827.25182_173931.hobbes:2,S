Hi Eric,
nice to get some feedback from you. I definitely didn't expected
an answer from down the driving core with such a brillant response
time. Thanks a lot!

All in all, the damage was pretty harmless. Critical data lives
on IDE SW Raid5 arrays here anyway. This was the first out of 10 
Maxtors failing, which were purchased during the IBM IDE disasters
around 2000/2001.

Then let's prove the fact. One could cool the drive, swap controllers, 
cable, driver settings...

I'm under the expression, that this is different in my case. It looked
like after some retries, it finally responded with the correct block in
some cases. I will later analyse this further.
From was I see, the kernel retries up to 8 times to read the same
LBA:
Oct 17 22:36:17 pico kernel: hdc: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=34225448, sector=34225448
Oct 17 22:36:39 pico kernel: hdc: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=34225448, sector=34225448
Oct 17 22:37:02 pico kernel: hdc: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=34225448, sector=34225448
Oct 17 22:37:25 pico kernel: hdc: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=34225448, sector=34225448
Oct 17 22:37:48 pico kernel: hdc: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=34225448, sector=34225448
Oct 17 22:38:11 pico kernel: hdc: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=34225448, sector=34225448
Oct 17 22:38:34 pico kernel: hdc: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=34225448, sector=34225448
Oct 17 22:38:57 pico kernel: hdc: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=34225448, sector=34225448
$((350*8)) = 2800 physical retries, if your number is right.
That's why it took 31 hours to copy the 80 GB. Under error free 
conditions, this job takes about 30-60 Min.
Thanks to your hint, I've found the offending piece in ide-disk.c/900:
    } else if (stat & ERR_STAT) {
        /* err has different meaning on cdrom and tape */
        if (err == ABRT_ERR) {
            if (drive->select.b.lba &&
                /* some newer drives don't support WIN_SPECIFY */
                hwif->INB(IDE_COMMAND_REG) == WIN_SPECIFY)
                return ide_stopped;
        } else if ((err & BAD_CRC) == BAD_CRC) {
            /* UDMA crc error, just retry the operation */
            drive->crc_count++;
        } else if (err & (BBD_ERR | ECC_ERR)) {
            /* retries won't help these */
            rq->errors = ERROR_MAX;
        } else if (err & TRK0_ERR) {
            /* help it find track zero */
            rq->errors |= ERROR_RECAL;
        }
    }
Now it looks, like I need an interface for a new option in the 
drive structure, where I can switch off this behavior of just
stupidly retrying on CRC errors. Any hints from somebody for
this one (which has a chance to get included, finally...).
Thanks again, Eric. This brought me directly to this.
