Ok, I'm getting nowhere fast.  It isn't shm but having shm enabled seemed to
exacberbate the real problem.
The problem is that processes get stuck in D state and unfortunately I can't
see what they are waiting on.  ps hangs at the first process that's broken  
when i run 'ps axwl'.  sysrq shows all sorts of different EIPs, some of them
at 00000246....odd place.
It happens even with apache stopped and proftpd stopped.  I haven't found
the magic key yet but here's a clue.  up for 30 minutes, nothing happening.
I log in, run pine, and start to send this mail.  *bam*  in a few seconds my
watchdogd kicks off the kernel's watchdog reboot.
Note, composing the the email is fine.  Saving it to /tmp/pico.123456 is
what appears to have triggered it.
  
(side note, here's watchdogd.c)
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
 
int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
{
   int fd=open("/dev/watchdog",O_WRONLY);
   if(fd==-1) {
	perror("watchdog");
        exit(1);  
   }
   while(1) {
        sync();   
 	system("/bin/ps awlx >/root/psawlx");
        write(fd,"\0",1);
 	sleep(20);
   }
}
Note, /root/psawlx shows _nothing_ out of the ordinary.  no D state, just S
and a the one R of the ps process.
As I send -this- email attempt, I am going to strace it and see if I can
catch something of a clue
how odd, note how "strace -f -p 213" exited when it shouldn't have

the machine is still running at this point
ok, it worked after -CONT, let's try another email.
perhaps it is the size of the body.
ok, it locked, watchdog snagged it and it's rebooting.  here's the session,
not the same as before, note where things ended.  now this could be
funkiness with strace timing or it could really be a broken kernel.

my guess is something bad is happening and the process died or was killed in
some fashion by the kernel and it's leaving some other kernel function in a
bad state.
