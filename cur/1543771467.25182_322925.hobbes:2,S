That would be interesting to find out. I've it on my TODO list to teach
bench-stresshighalloc to time how long allocations are taking. It'll be at
least a week before I get around to it though.

rmqueue_bulk() in the patch does something like this. It tries to allocate
in the largest possible blocks and falls back to the lower orders as
necessary. It could always be trying to reclaim though. I think the only
easy way to fail and return w/o reclaim is to use GFP_ATOMIC which would
have other consequences.

That is quite possible :) . I'll see about teaching the benchmarks to time
allocations to see how much time we spend satisfying order 4 allocations
on the standard kernel and with the patch.
