Thank you for the comment.
I think it's quite reasonable.
By doing that, we don't need end_io_error() anymore.
Jens,
What do you think?
If you agree with the interface change above, I would prefer to
separate the patch-set from blk_end_request patch-set like below:
    o blk_end_request: remove end_that_request_*
    o change interface of 'uptodate' in blk_end_request to 'error'
It makes the purpose of blk_end_request patch-set clear
(and also, each patch of device drivers could be smaller).
But, it doubles your merging work.  So if you would like to get
the changes at once, I'll merge them into blk_end_request patch-set.
As for the patch inclusion, do you push the driver changes to Linus
all at once?  Or should I ask each maintainer to take the patch?
Thanks,
Kiyoshi Ueda
