Just a general thought on removing drivers in general, when a driver is 
removed because there's a better one, it would be good to have either a 
message which shows up at "make oldconfig" time, or a file listing the 
driver(s) which replace it.
Half the resistance to removing drivers is finding what is supposed to 
replace the driver. For instance a list of all the drivers Adrian Bunk 
has suggested to replace sk98lin, so users have something better than 
searching the source code and/or LKML archive to find the next thing to try.
In general, if a driver works and is being used, until it *needs* 
attention I see no reason to replace it. I don't agree that "it forces 
people to try the new driver" is a valid reason, being unmaintained is 
only a problem if it needs maintenance. I am not going to reopen that 
topic, I'm simply noting a general opposition to unfunded mandates, and 
requiring changes to kernel, module and/or rc.local config is just that.
