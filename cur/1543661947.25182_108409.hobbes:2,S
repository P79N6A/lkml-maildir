the proper way to avoid such scenarios (besides removing tasks from all
waitqueues) is to remove the thread from all the PID-hashes prior setting
it to TASK_ZOMBIE. Since any signal-sending needs a task pointer, and the
task pointer can only be found by looking it up in the hash, the proper
way to exclude signal related wakeups (without introducing special
handling into the wakeup code), is to remove the thread from the hash.
