i turned off the motherboard Marvell Gbit devices and installed a 
Realtek 8169 card, all the while keeping to kernel version 
2.6.23-rc6, and saw all the network problems go away.  Must mean it 
was a sky2 driver bug.
Am currently running 2.6.23-rc7 on the affected server and the rc7 
sky2 driver is holding up fine so far.
thank you!
