This is Maciej's patch - latest posting of it that I have seen,
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2004-04/3174.html
His fix up of the 8259 ack issue (when used without routing 8254 pit into
io-apic INTIN0) successfully establishes a virtual wire mode input of the timer
which the nforce2 seems happy with albeit without being able to use
"nmi_debug=1"
It is that timer ack issue tied up with the integrated apic.

This refers to when it was in the 2.6.3-rc1-mm1
