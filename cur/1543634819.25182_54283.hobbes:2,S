Please do us a favor and do a *complete* upfit to the new DMA mapping
routines in a single file at a time, send the patch out for that one file,
then move on to the next.  Doing it the way you are now just generates
patch churn and makes it harder for other people to keep in sync with
current versions of files and makes it harder to avoid duplicating effort
and makes it harder for other people to work on these files as their
patches start failing to apply due to one line changes here or there.
