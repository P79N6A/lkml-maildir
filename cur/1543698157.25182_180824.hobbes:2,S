Hi, I just rebuilt my kernel with libata support.
I have 3112 Silicon Image controller with IDE drive attahed.
(I have 2 IDE drives, so I bought second controller to split load between them. One is connected to the MB IDE controller.)
When I run hdparm command, I can see strange behaviour of the ilbata driver:
[root@shrike root]# hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
  Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.19 seconds = 53.78 MB/sec
[root@shrike root]# hdparm -t /dev/sda1
/dev/sda1:
  Timing buffered disk reads:  read(1048576) returned 921600 bytes
[root@shrike root]#
Meanwhile -T switch works normally.
I know, that siimage support is broken, any ideas, what can possibly cause such errors?
Is it somehow linked to the error discussed in this message thread?
WBR.
