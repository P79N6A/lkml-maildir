 Perhaps, but these drivers are involved and the device-specific knowledge 
will help tracking down the cause.  I have general experience on how 
interrupts work, including on APIC-based systems, but I have no idea how 
UHCI and EHCI devices work in this area and, in particular, how you know 
an interrupt coming from the line #19 is related to one on the line #20 
and then a spurious one if not recorded as ERR or otherwise unclaimed 
(which would be reported as "irq 19: nobody cared").
