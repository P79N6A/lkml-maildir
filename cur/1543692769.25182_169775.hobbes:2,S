I just got some new Dell Precision 360's, 2 of which have SATA drives
that I'm trying to install RH9 on. I built a new kernel from the 2.4.22
sources, patched with the 2.4.22-ac4 patches. When I boot, linux
recognizes the drives, but hangs doing a partition check. Here's what I
see on the console:
ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xFE00 ctl 0xFE12 bmdma 0xFEA0 irq 17
ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xFE20 ctl 0xFE32 bmdma 0xFEA8 irq 17
ata1: dev 0 ATA, max UDMA/133, 234375000 sectors (lba48)
ata1: dev 0 configured for UDMA/133
ata2: port disabled, ignoring.
scsi0: ata_piix
scsi1: ata_piix
  Vendor: ATA	Model: ST3120026AS	Rev: 0.71
  Type:   Direct-Access			ANSI SCSI revision: 05
Attached scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
SCSI device sda: 234375000 512-byte sectors (120000 MB)
Partition check:
sda:<3>ata1: DMA timeout, stat 0x24
Has this been seen before, or are these boxes just too far out on the
bleeding edge and I'm going to have to wait a while ?
Thanks,
	Drew
