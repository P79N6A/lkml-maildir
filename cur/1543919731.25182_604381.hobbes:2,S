Fix line number reporting when checking source files (as opposed to
patches)
Signed-off-by: Mike D. Day <ncmike@us.ibm.com>

checkpatch.pl-next (as of Oct. 12) reports lines incorrectly when
checking source files as opposed to checking patches.
A line number will show up twice in a normal message, 3 times when
using the --emacs option. Here is an example using the 10/12 version:
~/slp-devel/src/cmd-utils/slp_query/slp_query.c:9:
ERROR: trailing whitespace #13: FILE:
~/slp-devel/src/cmd-utils/slp_query/slp_query.c:10:
In the report above, checkpatch reports three different line numbers:
9, 13, and 10. When using the --file option, all numbers are supposed
to be the same. One of the errors is caused by initializing the prefix
too early. By moving that line from 606 to 675 there an improvement,
though still incorrect:
~/slp-devel/src/cmd-utils/slp_query/slp_query.c:10:
ERROR: trailing whitespace #13: FILE:
~/slp-devel/src/cmd-utils/slp_query/slp_query.c:10: 
To check a sourcefie, checkpatch diffs that file with /dev/null and
pipes the resulting patch into stdin. Checkpatch uses different
variables to keep track of a patch ($linenr) and the corresponding
line in the sourcefile ($realline). Since the sourcefile *is* a patch
in this case, the line number is reported incorrectly.
To fix this, checkpatch needs to alter the variable it uses for the
source line when the --file option is used, as below. 
$prefix = "$filename:$realline: " if ($emacs && $file);
$prefix = "$filename:$linenr: " if ($emacs && !$file);
