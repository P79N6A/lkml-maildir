Hi,
I am writing a dummy filesystem with the minimal features. At present I am
writing the mkfs.dummyfs. I am testing it on a Ramdisk. My doubt is
whether both are funtionally the same. That is if my mkfs.dummyfs works on
Ramdisk, it sjhould also work on a harddisk partition right? Please help
me wi the answer.
Thanks in advance,
Warm regs,
sathish.j
