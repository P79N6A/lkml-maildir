there's no way the rlimit patch can cover shmget(SHM_HUGETLB) and
shmctl(SHM_LOCK). That's the use of this patch.
Plus it obsoletes the need of setting rlimit for apps like databases.
the rlimit patch remains useful for the multiuser system you're talking
about (assuming you also limit the number of tasks per-user
accordingly).
