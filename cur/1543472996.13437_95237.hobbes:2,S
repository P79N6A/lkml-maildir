It's possible to reduce it to two variables, but not one.
The host compiler and the target compiler must be kept separate
so that cross-compiling works.  Consider someone on an i386 who is
building a kernel for an alpha machine.  They need HOSTCC to
compile helper programs like scripts/mkdep.c, and CC to compile
the main body of the code.
Try something like this:
	HOSTCC  	=egcc
	HOSTCFLAGS	=-Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
	TARGETCC	=egcc
	TARGETCFLAGS	=-D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
	CROSS_COMPILE 	=
	AS	=$(CROSS_COMPILE)as
	LD	=$(CROSS_COMPILE)ld
	CC	=$(CROSS_COMPILE)$(TARGETCC) $(TARGETCFLAGS)
	CPP	=$(CC) -E
If that works for you, mail me a patch, and I'll test it myself
and submit it to Alan Cox.
