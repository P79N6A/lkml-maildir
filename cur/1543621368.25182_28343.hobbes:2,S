I think I see what you meant.
However, I'm not particularly keen on the M68K offset generator. I'm not sure
why exactly, but it just doesn't seem the right way to do things... OTOH,
without making the assembler able to parse C structs, I'm not sure there is a
"right" way:-/

How about I quote Linus (who explained what he wanted better than I did).
Firstly, in response to me having supplied a patch that made a set of four
byte-size values as the status area in the task_struct:

And then after some discussion:

(struct low_level became thread_info).
