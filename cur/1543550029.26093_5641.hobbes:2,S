Hum nobody has said anything to me till now. I was holding back with my
patch till I had time to test it on more that one laptop. While the
patch looks Ok, passed experience has shown it must be verified on more
than one model of Toshiba laptop before being marked as safe. Ideally a
dozen or so laptop models is best.
Remember any error in this driver could render a Toshiba laptop quite
literally unusable. With a trip to a Toshiba authorized reseller, the
parting of some cash, and with potential data loss.

Which may not be enough. When I submit my own version of the driver
is it permissible to have a sprinkling of #ifdef's so it still compiles
on older kernels. I would prefer to only have to maintain one version.
