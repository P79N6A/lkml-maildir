Yes it is.  Just a bit funny if you think about it, but with Intel and
Via putting the UHCI core into their chipsets I guess it makes sense.
One note for the archives, if you are presented a choice between a OHCI
or a UHCI controller, go for the OHCI.  It has a "cleaner" interface,
handles more of the logic in the silicon, and due to this provides
faster transfers.
In it's defense, the UHCI design was the first one, and OHCI
capitalized on that by fixing some of its weaknesses.  Hopefully the
same thing will not happen for USB 2.0, and everyone will like EHCI.
