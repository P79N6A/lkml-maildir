Yes, all files are correctly removed and the memory freed with that patch.

That's ok. Right now its only a potential problem for us and if it becomes
a real one, I can investigate it further. My current idea is to have a
device_{create,remove}_{platform,bus}_file() interface that adds files
to all devices (*_platform_file) or all devices in that belong to one bus
subdir (*_bus_file). They would then shared a struct inode and thus 
appear hard linked. The space wasted by the dentries is a lot less than
what the dentries need.

Yes, I know. Unfortunately, the physical layout is not a tree and therefore
not easy to represent in a file system. The architecture is also trying
hard to hide the physical layout from the OS because 99% of the time,
we don't care.

If it was that easy, I probably wouldn't have needed to ask ;-). The main 
problem is that a device can be connected to multiple control units 
(something vaguely like a bridge in PCI semantics) and each of these can 
itself be connected to multiple channel paths (i.e. connectors of the 
'channel subsystem', our root bus within driverfs).
The i/o driver in Linux can mostly ignore these details, because it is based
on 'subchannels', which are logical connections from the channel subsystem
to a single device, independent of the path(s) inbetween.

There can be 256 channel paths, each going to a control unit and each 
control unit can have a number of devices depending on its type, at least 
thousands of devices for certain types (actually, it's yet a bit more 
complicated than that ;-).
The total number of devices is currently limited to 65536, each device has 
one unique subchannel, irq (irq number equals subchannel number) and device 
number.
[Conny, please correct me if I've been telling nonsense]
It might be possible to list the devices by their channel path if I could
use symbolic links inside driverfs for devices that are accessed through
multiple channel paths, but I don't think there is much to gain from that
compared to the extra effort.
Thanks for your help,
