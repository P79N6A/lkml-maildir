  Guys, it looks like we've got two "competing" objectives:
- ASCII, human-readable output which doesn't require specialised tools
- binary, computer-readable I/O which does require specialised tools.
But these objectives don't *have* to compete. They're actually
orthogonal.
It *is* possible to have the best of both worlds. Have a look at the
MTRR driver. It's got an ioctl(2) interface for the benefit of X, and
it's got a simple read(2)/write(2) interface for the benefit of humans
and script writers.
You get efficiency and convenience for programmes (ioctl(2) interface)
and convenience for humands (read(2)/write(2) interface).
