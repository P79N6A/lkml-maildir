How will the clean up of the kernelstore work?

In that case the access to kernel level is protected by a very secure
combination of secure hash and magic number checking. But anyway there is a
small chance to get to some kernel memory unauthorized. Do you know if this is
the first (known) interface which has a more practical approach to kernel data
structure security?
If we want to be a bit more strict, we can have a pre-allocated pool of
semaphores and the kernel pointer check can add the kernelk address of the
semaphore region into account. It's faster than the checksum probably and more
secure in protecting the rest of the kernel memory. Spoofing access to other
semaphores would be still possible (but can be protected by a smaller hash).
