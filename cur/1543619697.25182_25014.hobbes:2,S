I notice that the BKL is held for a short time, while daemonizing:
+ 
lock_kernel();
+ 
daemonize();
+ 
reparent_to_init();
+ 
strcpy(current->comm, kth->name);
+ 
unlock_kernel();
Have you noticed that a lot of kernel daemons hold the BKL whenever 
they're active?  Things like nfsd are always holding the BKL, only 
releasing it on schedule(), and exit.  Is there any compelling reason to 
hold the BKL during times other than during the daemonize() process?
