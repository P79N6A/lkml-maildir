My understanding is that if one designed a power supply with enough 
headroom, one could remove the power and still have time to write dirty 
sectors to the USB flash stick. Would this not remove the need for a 
journaling fs on a flash stick. This would remove the "wear on that 
spot" problem. Actually USB flash sticks are a bit clever, in that they 
add an extra layer of translation to the write. I.e. If you write to the 
same sector again and again, the USB flash stick will actually write it 
to a different area of the memory each time. This is specifically done 
to save the "wear on that spot" problem.
This "flush on power fail" approach is not so easy with a HD because it 
uses more power and takes longer to flush.
