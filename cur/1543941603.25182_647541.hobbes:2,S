Hi,
Currently we have a generic clock api for using clocks.
This patchset tries to fill other side: an api for providing
clocks.
Currently each platform that wants to provide <linux/clk.h>
implementation is forced to reimplement everything from scratch.
This leads for major code duplication. E.g. the ARM arch
contains 13 implementations (one for each mach). Also there are
implementations for AVR, MIPS, PowerPC and SH.
This patchset implements the "management" part, so each platform
would have to only implement few platform-specific parts.
