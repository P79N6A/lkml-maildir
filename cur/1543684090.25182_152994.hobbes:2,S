Without this patch the probability to globally balance when going idle
is 0. Now it is 1/global_balance_rate(cpus_in_this_node) . This is
tunable and we can make this probability depending on the node load
imbalance. I'll try that in the next version, it sounds like a good
idea. Also changing this probability by some factor could give us a
way to handle the differences between the platforms.
Balancing globally only when idle isn't a good idea as long as we
don't have multiple steals per balance attempt. Even then, tasks don't
live all the same time, so you easilly end up with one node overloaded
and others just busy and not able to steal from the busiest node.

I'll try to include the node imbalance in the global balance rate
calculation, let's see how it works. Just wanted to fix one issue with
my patch, now it looks like it provides some simple ways to solve
other issues as well... Thanks for the idea!
