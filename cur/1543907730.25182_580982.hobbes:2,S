I don't think how it could be relevant here. lguest kernel does use
2MB pages, and it goes smootly. For 2MB pages, we will update the page
tables in the very same way, and in the very places we did before.
Just that the operations can now be overwritten.
So, unless I'm very wrong,  it only makes sense to talk about not
supporting large pages in the guest level. But it is not a
paravirt_ops problem.
