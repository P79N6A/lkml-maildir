You've obviously never been to a meeting/conference and booted
a Linux notebook with a kernel that sets things to a non-zero
default :-)
If the default is to turn up also the microphone (and to enable
it in the first place), you might notice that even apparently
weak speakers are perfectly capable of producing a very LOUD
alarm-like sound. And you'll have to sit through this until
your user-mode utility loads and turns the mess off, while
everybody is turning to stare at you.
0 is the only safe default setting.
