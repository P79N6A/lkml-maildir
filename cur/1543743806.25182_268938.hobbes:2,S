I agree with Andries that a reasonably small number of lines with
Pure Bloat (aka, not used at all) can stay as source bloat, #ifdefed,
but disagree on it getting lost if removed from the kernel, these days
once something gets in the kernel for at least one release it can be
fairly considered written in stone, with so many mirrors, source
navigation sites, search engines that open all kinds of files looking
for any sequence of letters or even pictures, sounds, etc.
Some years ago, when working with IPX I thought about looking at
finishing Jay Schullist initial work on SPX, but after some time I
just gave up and deleted the thing from mainline, but it is easly
retrievable in case somebody has any kind of interest.
