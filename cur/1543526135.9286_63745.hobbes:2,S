What's even more problematic is that you can not find state of eject BUTTON.
And if CD is already removed it's to late to issue "eject cd" command or
umount or ... Disk is gone, the only choice you have is to oops (or ask user
to put CD back -- see my other letters on subject)...
P.S. And "ask user" approach is also not perfect: WHICH user ? If there are
100 users logged in system and disk is used by dome deamon  (like updatedb)
which user should be asked to put CD/floppy back ? It's easyto put such feature
in single-user OS like AmigaOS, WindowsNT and/or MacOS. It's MUCH more
complicated to put it in mutliuser OS with remote login possibility...
