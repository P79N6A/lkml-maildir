Hi Jamie,
  I agree there is little if any information in the Intel documention
(anyone from Intel care to
comment?)  on this topic.   I do not have the references handy at the
moment, but in a prior-art
search for a patent I was working on, I stumbled across a number of patents
and papers
regarding controlling or optimizing hardware TLB replacement.  The only
hint we have on
IA32 is _PAGE_GLOBAL, and we have already gotten ourselves in touble with
it once.
  As the world moves toward software-managed TLBs this will become moot
anyway.
Thanks,
Mark
