I've added boobytraps to do_wp_page, do_anonymous_page,
swap_in, kmem_cache_alloc and kmem_cache_create.

With the new patch (see my other message) we can track down
the bug in a slighly more detailed way. This is because most
of the calls to __get_free_pages() are not done directly but
through other functions.
The new patch contains booby traps for those functions too.
