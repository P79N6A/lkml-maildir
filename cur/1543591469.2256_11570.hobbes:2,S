I'd like to break these assumptions.  Or at the very least see how far
they can be bent.  I know this sounds crazy to a lot of hackers, but 
I think there's a certain amount of unhelpful elitism and self-puffery
in the "kernels are hard to configure and they *should* be hard to 
configure* attitude.  Let's give Aunt Tillie a chance to surprise us.

Already in the plan -- in fact the EXPERT symbol exists in CML2 now.

It is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our
liberties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of
citizens and one of the noblest characteristics of the late
Revolution. The freemen of America did not wait till usurped power had
strengthened itself by exercise and entangled the question in
precedents. They saw all the consequences in the principle, and they
avoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this
lesson too much ... to forget it
