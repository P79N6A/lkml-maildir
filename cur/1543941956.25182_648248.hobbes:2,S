one caveat btw; when the multiqueue storage hw becomes available for Linux,
we need to figure out how to deal with the preference thing; since there
honoring a "non-logical" preference would be quite expensive (it means
you can't make the local submit queues lockless etc etc), so before we go down
the road of having widespread APIs for this stuff.. we need to make sure we're
not going to do something that's going to be really stupid 6 to 18 months down the road.
