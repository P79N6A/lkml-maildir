i think we should actually do #1 unconditionally.
ISTs are bad for the native kernel too. They have various nasty 
complications in the stack walker (and hence they _reduce_ reliability in 
practice), and they are non-preemptible as well. Plus we have the 
maximum-stack-footprint ftrace plugin now, which can remove any perception 
about how bad the worst-case stack footprint is in practice.
If it ever becomes an issue we could also soft-switch to a larger (per 
CPU) exception stack from the exception handlers themselves. The 
architectural stack footprint of the various critical exceptions are 
calculatable and low - so we could switch away and get almost the kind of 
separation that ISTs give. There's no deep reason to actually make use of 
hw switched ISTs.
So feel free to send a patch that just standardizes the critical 
exceptions to use the regular kernel stack. (I havent actually tried this 
but it should be relatively simple to implement. Roadblocks are possible.)
