Not necessarily true at all.
There are actually a number of BIOSes that have an option to enable
_nothing_ but the actual devices needed for booting. 
Now, I admit to not having tried that option, because it definitely
doesn't work with the current state of Linux drivers.

I'm not saying the driver should do the dirty work.
I'm saying the _helper_ function should do the dirty work, and I'm saying
that the bootup sequence should _not_ necessarily do it.
Note that on non-PC machines this tends to make more sense. It also makes
a whole lot more sense if you start thinking about hot-plug etc. You
should let the driver do a simple "pci_enable_mem()", and that's the thing
that enables the memory mapping.
The same way you should have the PCMCIA drivers do a
"pcmcia_enable_mem()", for example. 
Think of it as a part of a larger pattern. In general, the driver may be
the only entity that knows which memory regions it needs enabled. It's not
just about PCI, it's about the concept.
