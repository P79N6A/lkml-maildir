Hi,
  Actually even though the printks are getting executed.
  ONLY some appear. I have given both KERN_ERR and KERN_DEBUG
   Its not the log level problem. probably the buffer or something else.
   am not sure on that.
   i have given printk_ratelimit_burst= 1000 ; printk_ratelimit_jiffies = 0 ;
   but it does not work.
   Please Advice,
   Regards,
   sriram
