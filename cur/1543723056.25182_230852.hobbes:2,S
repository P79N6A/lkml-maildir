It isn't that simple.  As I've already pointed out, there is no provision
to do a "maybe hardware exists, maybe it doesn't, lets claim individual
ttys based upon that decision".
It's a restriction of the way the TTY layer is setup to work with the
rest of the kernel, especially the character device layer.
We have these objects called TTY drivers.  They claim a range of TTY
devices, which are attached to a major number, starting at a minimum
minor number, and extending for a certain number of minor numbers.
This marks the complete range of minor numbers as being in use.  This
occurs when a serial driver is registered _well_ before any hardware
is touched.
Separate from that, we register TTY devices for each tty line, maybe
depending on whether hardware exists.  This occurs substantially later
than when the major/minor range is reserved.

Seriously, the scale of changes required to make this work without
hacks is nontrivial.  If it were trivial, I'd have done it long ago,
since then I wouldn't need /dev/ttyAM, /dev/ttySA, /dev/ttyFB etc
on ARM.
