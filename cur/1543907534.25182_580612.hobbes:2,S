See the code added to slub: Allocations are satisfied from the reserve 
patch or they are failing.

What would be expected it some recalculation of min_freekbytes?

Try NUMA constraints and zone limitations.

Because the argument is that performance does not matter since the code

There is your problem. The justification is not clear at all and the
