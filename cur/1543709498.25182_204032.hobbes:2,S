This doesn't fail right now, or rather it shouldn't.  We would call
kgdb_arch_init() which would set it to 8250 (or arch serial) and go.  If
8250||arch serial is compiled in.

Which means you have to either c&p this into kgdb_arch_init for every
arch that provides it's own, or (and I've been thinking that this isn't
necessarily a bad idea) standardize on names for the arch serial driver,
and in kernel/kgdb.c::kgdb_entry() do:
#ifdef CONFIG_KGDB_8250
  extern ... kgdb8250_serial;
  kgdb_serial = &kgdb8250_serial;
#elif CONFIG_KGDB_ARCH_SERIAL
  extern ... kgdbarch_serial;
  kgdb_serial = &kgdbarch_serial;
#elif CONFIG_KGDB_ETH
  extern ... kgdboe_serial;
  kgdb_serial = &kgdboe_serial;
#endif
