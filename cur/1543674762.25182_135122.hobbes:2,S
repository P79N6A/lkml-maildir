You'll also enter BIOS (System Management Mode actually) when inserting
or removing the power cord, or when thermal events occur, and possibly
also when suspending.
The blacklist rule is a catch-all since we don't have detailed DMI
data on all Inspiron/Latitude models, and at the time, _all_ of them
were broken. Looking through my records, Inspiron 8000 and 8100, and
Latitude C600, C610, C640, C800, and C810 are known to be broken. Note
that this includes at least one P4-based machine (C640), so it's not
restricted to "old" mobile P3s.
The only non-broken Dell laptop that I know of is the Latitude D600
(Centrino), and that was reported only two months ago.
I'm all for adding an explicit white-list to dmi_scan.c. For starters,
the D600 should be included. Partial dmidecode data for it is included
below.
(There is also a generic problem in that apm can enter the BIOS
asynchronously if you configure DISPLAY_BLANK or CPU_IDLE, or build
apm as a module and unload it. Both DISPLAY_BLANK and unloading the
module are known lock-up triggers if the local APIC is enabled.)
