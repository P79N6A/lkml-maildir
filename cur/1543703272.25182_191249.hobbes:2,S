Correct, in fact every platform where cache flushing matters
at all (ie. where flush_cache_*() routines actually need to
flush a cpu cache), they should have tlb_start_vma() do such
a flush.

When the kernel unmaps a mmap region of a process (either for the
sake of munmap() or tearing down all mapping during exit()) tlb_start_vma()
is called, the page table mappings in the region are torn down one by
one, then a tlb_end_vma() call is made.
At the top level, ie. whoever invokes unmap_page_range(), there will
be a tlb_gather_mmu() call.
In order to properly optimize the cache flushes, most platforms do the
following:
1) The tlb->fullmm boolean keeps trap of whether this is just a munmap()
   unmapping operation (if zero) or a full address space teardown
   (if non-zero).
2) In the full address space teardown case, and thus tlb->fullmm is
   non-zero, the top level will do the explict flush_cache_mm()
   (see mm/mmap.c:exit_mmap()), therefore the tlb_start_vma()
   implementation need not do the flush, otherwise it does.
   This is why sparc64 and friends implement it like this:
#define tlb_start_vma(tlb, vma) \
do {    if (!(tlb)->fullmm)     \
                flush_cache_range(vma, vma->vm_start, vma->vm_end); \
} while (0)
Hope this clears things up.
Someone should probably take what I just wrote, expand and organize it,
then add such content to Documentation/cachetlb.txt
