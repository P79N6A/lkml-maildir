I found some bug in linux-2.3.4:
1- Compiler warning gcc-2.7.2.3 (There are BUGS!):
/usr/bin/gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce
-DCPU=686 -DMODULE   -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c usb.c
usb.c: In function `usb_init':
usb.c:76: warning: implicit declaration of function `usb_acm_init'
/usr/bin/gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce
-DCPU=686 -DMODULE   -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c acm.c
acm.c: In function `write_acm':
acm.c:79: warning: declaration of `buffer' shadows a parameter
acm.c: In function `acm_probe':
acm.c:168: warning: passing arg 2 of `__create_pipe' makes integer from
pointer without a cast
acm.c:169: warning: passing arg 2 of `__create_pipe' makes integer from
pointer without a cast
acm.c:170: warning: passing arg 2 of `__create_pipe' makes integer from
pointer without a cast
2- Floppy disk as module
Kernel with floppy disk as module don't work (from 2.3.3). There was
a lot of message in the kernel list, with many solution, but floppy
don't work as module.
3- Clock too fast!
When I compile, reboot and recompile I have a lots errors like this:
make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.3/kernel'
make[2]: *** Warning: File `.time.o.flags' has modification time in the
future (928354045 > 928347961)
make[2]: Nothing to be done for `all_targets'.
make[2]: *** Warning:  Clock skew detected.  Your build may be
incomplete.
The error come from a kernel between 2.2.6 and 2.3.3.
