3) teach people that you don't always have to add new includes right
   at the end of the list
4) teach people that you don't have to add Makefile rules right at the
   end of the list
5) ditto feature-removal
6) ditto lots of other things.
My usual way of fixing these things when they pop up is to just move the
offending addition to some random position other than end-of-list.  I must
have done this hundreds of times and as yet I don't think anyone has noticed ;)
