But at the same time I'd like to avoid sync becoming serialised on its
writes.  If you've got a lot of filesystems mounted, doing each
filesystem's sync sequentially and synchronously is going to be a lot
slower than allowing async syncs.  In other words, for sync(2) we really
want async commit submission followed by a synchronous wait for
completion.  And that's probably more churn than I'd like to see at this
stage for 2.4.
Cheers, 
 Stephen
