It would be easy to add a label "owner" the same way that there's
an optional CIPSO mapping now. Writes to /smack/load would require
that the writer be the owner of the object label in the rule. I think
it would still require privilege to assign ownership, a non-parsed
write to /smack/labelowner should suffice for the mechanism. It seems
that you might need to support multiple labels for this to be really
effective, but I'm not sure why I think that. I'm also not sure that
once you draw a complete picture it won't be indistinguishable from
POSIX ACLs.
