For the battery module:
# echo 0x00040000 > /proc/acpi/debug_layer
and then to turn on everything about it:
# echo 0xffffffff > /proc/acpi/debug_level
These hooks exist only if the kernel is built with CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG.
It would be interesting to know if you can examine the contents of
/proc/acpi/battery/*/*
