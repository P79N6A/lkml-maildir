Ok that much is easy to deal with. You print the luid in /proc.

So you want a setpluid(pid, luid) ? Trivial to add although you might
want to refuse it in many secure environments but thats an SELinux rule
again.

In those cases its akin to and matches security domain transitions which
says to me SELinux (or AppArmour) should do it.
