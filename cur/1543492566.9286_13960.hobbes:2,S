Well, the exact point of using a macro would be to replace code like:
if(!current->uid){
	do_root_stuff();
}
with somethig like:
if(IS_ROOT_PROCESS(current)){
	do_root_stuff();
}
That way if someone does't like the idea, the macro could be defined
diffrent ways:
#ifdef DYNAMIC_ROOT_ID
#define IS_ROOT_PROCESS(P) p->uid == special_id
#else
#define IS_ROOT_PROCESS(p) !p->uid
#endif
