FS generates request, received by loop. loop reads/writes the buffer on
the real device, that uses another request.

Yes

No -- in 2.4 it does, all queues have their own request freelist.
However the way that loop works in 2.4, it doesn't allocate/use any
requests at all.

Well data is read/written to loop, which then generates a matching
request for the target device.

The source is right there, under your nose.

Just dive in, learn as you go along. Or look at loop + crypto patches.
