I wonder if it would be a good idea to separate all the user-space
relevant stuff in header files from the kernel-only internals.
I mean creating a <linux/api/ppdev.h> etc. for all the ioctls and
user-visible structure definitions.  Leave the _kernel_ stuff in linux/.
Applications that use a feature should still make a copy of the
appropriate header file.  (But they don't have to, at least when
throwing something together locally).  At least they could just copy
files, instead of extracting individual definitions and having to change
the references to fundamental types.
