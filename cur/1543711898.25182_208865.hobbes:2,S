If someone's not treating the leftover bits as "don't cares", then
there's a bug. Or so goes the current convention. I think originally, I
had avoided touching the bits at the end, then the "don't cares"
suggestion was incorporated). This doesn't appear to be problematic on
smaller systems. Any idea where this bogon might be?
