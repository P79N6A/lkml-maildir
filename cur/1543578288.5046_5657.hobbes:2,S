 cat /proc/version
 Linux version 2.4.0-test11 (root@celery) (gcc version 2.95.2 20000220
 (Debian GNU/Linux)) #1 SMP Fri Dec 15 01:45:43 EST 2000
snipping from dmesg:
reiserfs: checking transaction log (device 21:08) ...
Using tea hash to sort names
ReiserFS version 3.6.22
while mkdir "$(perl -e 'print "x" x 768')" works just fine, doing a
mkdir "$(perl -e 'print "x" x 4000')" will create the dir, but will NOT
segfault any program, NOR cause a kernel oops.. howeever, it will NOT
show up with ls.  rm -rf "$(perl -e 'print "x" x 4000')" _will_ work...
i have yet to experience any crashes, segfaults or oopses since.
