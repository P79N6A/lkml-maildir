Yeah, but who did the auditing of all user land packages if they
don't need changes? And who told user land developers that they need
to do this all if they only want to recompile software.
That hasn't been done as far as I can figure out, and I'm not really
willing to serve as the frontend/coordinator for this process on the x86-64 
side.
I would request that this stuff is only turned on by default
until there is a reasonable process found for this.

That would still leave the mainline users who just update their
kernels from a kernel.org tarball out in the rain.
And guess who they will complain to if their favourite program doesn't
work anymore in x86-64 32bit emulation?
