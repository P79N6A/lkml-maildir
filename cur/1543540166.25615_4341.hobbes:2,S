And I find it ridiculous. Yes, for FILES I agree - it's place to install
local files for system. But for directory stubs... Where the hell I must
put local perl packages ? I prefer /usr/local/lib/perl for architecture
specific-ones and /usr/local/share/perl . And I (as dstribuion creator)
even can configure perl to use this directories. But I CAN NOT (according
to FHS) create this directories. Gosh. So now I need to GUEES where I can
put my extension files in /usr/local (or just put system specific files for
perl, tcl, guile and so on in some other place in system - but where ?).
Looks like FHS was created without such packages in mind (even if they are
numerous - emacs, perl, tcl, python, guile, etc: all this packages can be
configured to use OS-specific files and system-specific files just like
C compiler, but FHS supports such thing only for C compiler). Still it's
not kernel problem.

Your packager should handle this. If it's not part of OS then it should be
installed in /opt - this part of FHS looks Ok.

IMO the only reson to keep X in there is to make linux more like other unixes.

It's usually not even possible: you need glibc for /sbin/init. It's why there
are exist /bin,/lib,/sbin and /usr/bin,/usr/lib,/usr/sbin : files in
/bin,/lib,/sbin are needed to support mounting of other parts of system so
you can not put then on separate partition.

Yeah, kernel source is usually bigger then contents of /bin,/lib,/sbin
(and /etc) combined.
