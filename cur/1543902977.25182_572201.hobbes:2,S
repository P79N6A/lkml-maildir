Okay, as noted off-list, after I exported the xtime_seconds it now 
builds and works. However, there are a *lot* of "section mismatches" 
which are not reassuring.
Boots, runs, glitch1 test runs reasonably smoothly. automount has not 
used significant CPU yet, but I don't know what triggers it, the bad 
behavior did not happen immediately without the patch. However, it looks 
very hopeful.
Warnings attached to save you the trouble...
