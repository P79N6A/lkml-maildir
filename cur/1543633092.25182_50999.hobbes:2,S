I can't even find info on this mobo.  Every hit Google returned was a link
to a thread on lkml :)  Does it have a VIA chipset by any chance?
There is a known lonstanding incompatibility between the SoundBlaster
Live! series and the VIA VT82C686B southbridge.  You can fix it by messing
with your BIOS, but I wasn't brave enough to try that.  You can get more
info from www.viahardware.com I think (it won't load properly on this
computer so I can't give an exact link).
