It always seemed to me that it was userspace that should poke the
watchdog as an indication user space still works on the system.  That's
how my watchdogs are managed.  I do initialize them in the boot loader
with a 3 minute timeout which is more than long enough for the system to
boot, load the driver and change the timeout to 60 seconds or whatever
I want at runtime and start the watchdog daemon.
If the kernel hangs at initializing some driver, I do NOT want the
kernel to automatically be poking the watchdog.  I want it to time out
so to me the kernel should not be able to kick the watchdog at all by
itself.
