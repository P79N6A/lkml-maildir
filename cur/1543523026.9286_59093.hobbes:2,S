I deleted the corresponding -march=i686 flag in arch/i686/Makefile
(if PROCESSOR_TYPE=K7 ... ) and compiled the kernel without any
errors.
But after reboot and the message "Uncompressing kernel ..."
appearing on screen my system freezes without any further
information (no kernel panic or so).

Ha! What I've guessed before. It's not dependend on the dist.
It seems to me, that nobody has tested this configuration before.
Hm?!
Let's wait what will come next ...
