Hi Phil,
Thanks Phil - the updated driver solved my problem, I am now happily up and 
running (and doing big writes without problems) on a fresh-compiled 2.4.20 
kernel, with the /drivers/scsi tree patched with the latest set of Justin 
Gibbs' drivers (6.2.36)
Thanks to Justin also, and everybody else who has (no doubt) worked on the 
new Adaptec drivers to improve it since the versions included with the 
official kernel.org 2.4.19 and 2.4.20 kernel sources.
Vinnie
