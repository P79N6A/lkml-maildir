Sure. Any attempt to keep the old min/max and make them automagically
do the right thing is doomed since there is no _single_ right thing
we want from them and choice should be deliberate and explicit. No
arguments here.

Ugh. I have a serious feeling that most of them would be redundant, but...
OK, I guess that somebody might want "unsigned max of x and y % 256" (x
being unsigned char and y - unsigned long).  Yes, with stuff like that
we'd really need a function for every type, but I would be very surprised
if somebody actually needed that (and I'd rather see it written explicitly,
regardless of the mechanism we use).

Well, that's what grep is for.  Bet that we'll see MAX, __max, m4x and
all sorts of similar "workarounds", so grep'n'LART will be needed anyway.
