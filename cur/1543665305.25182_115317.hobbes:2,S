No progress since Linus totally ignored it, but at least two
perfctr-patched trees exist. OSDL does one for the development
kernel, and Jack Perdue has pre-patched RedHat kernel .rpms.
(For Jack's stuff, check out PAPI -> Links -> Related Software.)
I'm planning to simplify the kernel <--> user-space interface in
perfctr-2.6 (drop /proc/pid/perfctr and go back to /dev/perfctr),
and then I _think_ I can do a version that doesn't require patching
kernel source. (It will do binary code patching at module load-time
instead. Horrible as that sounds, it's easier to deal with for users.)
