Well, just having documentation on how all the spooge in drivers/mtd
actually goes together would go along way to helping people use it.  The
flash chip is an SST 39SF010.  It will appear somewhere in PCI memory
space once I reenable the adapter ROM.  It is a JEDEC compilant device.
I have some code from SST for programming it, but I'd rather go the
general route instead of the one-shot flash-and-run module.
I was playing with the physmap driver but that kept oppsing the machine.
That was with 2.4.7 tho'.
I think it'll be as "simple" as adding the ID to jedec.c.  Load chips/*,
maps/hpt-rom (doctored physmap to enable the rom and use it's location),
and then see if I can get mtdchar to drive the mess.

PS: Never use the PoS "load.exe" from HPT.  It's apparently designed for a
    4MHz 286.  The delay loops are VERY wrong on any modern processor.  A
    PII 233 fails to properly write 10% of the bytes.
