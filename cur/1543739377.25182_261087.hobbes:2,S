I run both, on different machines.
I'm actually running 2.6.9-rc4-mm1-U3 at this very moment, on my laptop
(P4 2.53Ghz/UP, Mdk 10.1c) and also on my desktop machine (P4
2.80Ghz/SMP/HT, SuSE 9.1).
However, on the desktop (SMP/HT) I could only made it boot/init
successfully with CONFIG_PREEMPT_REALTIME off. On my laptop (UP) is
running pretty well on full RT.
Both kernel configs are attached.
config-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-U3.0smp.gz: is from my SMP/HT destop (non-RT-preempted)
config-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-RT-U3.0.gz: is from my laptopn (RT-preempted).
These seem stable, even though are taken from the menu-du-jour :)
Take care.
