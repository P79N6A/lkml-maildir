Even with large data sets that are mostly unsorted shell sorts performance 
is close to qsort, and there's an optimization that gives it O(n^(3/2)) 
runtime (IIRC), and another nice property is that it's iterative so it 
doesn't eat up stack space (as oposed to qsort which is recursive and eats 
stack like ****)...
Yeah, I think shell sort would be good for the kernel.
