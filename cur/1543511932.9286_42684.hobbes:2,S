You don't have to be a jackass to fail to make a point. We could drop the
devfs wars if the purists who stubbornly cling to broken and non-sustainable
implementation quit bitching and spreading misinformation.

I thought about writing this special kernel patch where you make all
these things called "files".  You then assign "permissions" to them
using things called "commands".  It means you can do stuff like
chown root.disk /dev/sd/c0b1t3u0
chmod 0664 /dev/sd/c0b1t3u0
Amazingly, these "files" just have these permissions after I do this.
Now that's nice.
Then I realised that it would be _really_ great if once I'd run these
"commands" once, the "files" kept those "permissions" even after I
reboot!  Its really neat, but the only problem is it already works,
and I can't find anything for my patch to do...
