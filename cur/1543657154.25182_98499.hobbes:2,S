This would be the wrong thing (tm) for SMP: cli() gives a compile error 
for SMP, local_irq_save() creates the impression that the driver works 
on SMP systems. m68k is UP only, thus there is no need to fix it properly.
What about adding
+ #ifdef CONFIG_SMP
+ #error This driver does not work on SMP
+ #endif
Or a Kconfig dependency on !CONFIG_SMP?
