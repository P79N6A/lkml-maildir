Hiya
Looks good (well, won't be able to test that it doesn't break 4401 until
next week :-) ).
As for the 1GB patch going in, I sure hope they would (perhaps in a cleaned
up state, it might be more pretty if I just unconditionally enabled the
workaround and had a b44_alloc_skb() that tries a normal dev_alloc_skb and if
that gives something over 1GB retry with GFP_DMA...
A situation where it breaks even without 4g4g would help in getting the
patch in :-)
