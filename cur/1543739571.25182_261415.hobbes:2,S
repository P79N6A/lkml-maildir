But you have removed the sysctl that allows enabling and disabling of
dnotify at run time.  And you create setattr_mask_dnotify for which I can
find no caller.  And make gratuitous changes to the current dnotify code.
(I point this last out as it just increases the size of the patch for no
purpose.)
