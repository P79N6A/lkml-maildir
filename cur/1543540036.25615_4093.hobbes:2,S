I did prepare a boot diskette  getting the files from another server and 
with the command of
dd if=vmlinuz of=/dev/fdo bs=1440k
at /boot directory of 
Linux Mandrake release 6.1 (Helios)
Kernel 2.2.13-7mdksmp on an i686.
My machine is  586. dual pentium. and I do not remember the kernel. It
is stupid but so... 
Anyway  my guy says when I want to boot it
from floopy  
VFS:can not open root device 08:04
Kernel panic:VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:04 
Could you please help.(more info: I had scsi hard disk and loaded WinNT
and linux version. Then I had bid IDE hard disk and I did install
Mandrake to the half of 15GB new HD. the other part attached to NT. Then
my booting was from C and mandrake was running. mandrake see all otlers
old linux and dos(NT). When I want to run old linuux and NT I had to
boot(from BIOS) from SCSI. But old linux can not see mandrake. )
I would be thankful, if there exists any chance to open this guy without
spending days and days.. I did already spent one...best wishes
I did try 
dd if=floppyfw-current.img of=/dev/fd0
and he says 
Could not find kernel image:/
