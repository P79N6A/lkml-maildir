Not in do_wp_page(): that is only used for physically present pages, so
the pte we are touching doesn't count as a swap entry in the first
place.  A write fault to a swap-entry pte will go from
handle_pte_fault() via do_swap_page() into swap_in(), and there we _do_
perform a swap_free where necessary.
