The reason why BFS is often referred to as BeFS, is that there is a
another file-system, far older than Be's filesystem AFAIK, called BFS;
the SCO Unixware Boot File System, which is already supported in the
Linux-kernel. Hence the misnomer BeFS. I think we should keep it that
way to avoid confusion... After all, BeFS does indicate pretty well what
file-system we mean, and other alternatives, such as be_bfs, or renaming
SCO BFS to sco_bfs or similar feels awkward.
