Yes, false dependency is what I meant. And hrm, yeah I guess that mostly
movzbl would be used to get the byte from memory and zero-extend, making
sure there is no false dependency.

Since we have, on i386:
        int                     preempt_count;  /* 0 => preemptable, <0 => BUG */
        int                     migrate_count;/* 0: can migrate, <0: BUG */
        mm_segment_t            addr_limit;     /* thread address space:
and:
typedef struct {
        unsigned long seg;
} mm_segment_t;
Turning migrate_count into a char would only put padding between
migrate_count and addr_limit. So I still do not see a clear improvement
in memory usage there... but I don't specially care about it being an
integer or a byte though :)
