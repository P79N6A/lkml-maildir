Hmm, does akpm's -mm6 patch contain any header file cleanups?  I know
this file built in Linus' bk tree last night, although this wasn't
for SA1100.
Can you check whether arch/arm/kernel/setup.c includes asm/cacheflush.h
just before asm/tlbflush.h (which is a recent fix which went into Linus'
tree recently.)

I certainly don't like adding linux/mm.h to tlbflush.h - that seems
like a recipe for disaster.
