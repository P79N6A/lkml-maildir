While using the in-kernel Alsa, my ens1371 based Soundblaster behaved
the same way, but with the seperate Alsa modules (1.0.6a from Debian
unstable) the blopping, crackling etc. is far less present, but still
audible in some cases, mostly disk I/O.
(Kernel 2.6.9 with staircase 9.1, Abit KV8 Pro, AMD64 3200+)
