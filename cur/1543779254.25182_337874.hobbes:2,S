I was googling a bit with no luck.
But apperantly looking at include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h
I'm utterly wrong. It was the other way around that caused problems.
Placing the labels outside {} sometimes gave an unaligned start address,
whereas placing the label inside {} gave the correct address.
At his also makes sense. If ld decide to align a section then it will do
so after a label defined outside the section.
