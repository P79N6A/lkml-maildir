Except it still wouldn't be able to go: Does file xyz exist?  If not,
create file xyz.  If someone else had xyz that you didn't see, you would
still not be able to create it.  So what is the point of NOT showing it
other than to make it much harder to avoid conflicting names?
if you want to not see files that you have no rights to, filter it in
your user space application when it matters, and let user space see the
files when they need to in order to avoid name conflicts.
It would be an incredibly idiotic system that auto hides files just
because you can't use them.  We have ways to hide files in user space
for the convinience of users.  It would be too inconvinient for
applications if the OS hid files on us.
