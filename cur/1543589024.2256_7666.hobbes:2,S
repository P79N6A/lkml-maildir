Hellor George,
As others have suggested, you can do what you are asking for using LTT
(
http://www.opersys.com/LTT
).
Specifically, you may want to use the event allocation capabilities.
This will enable you to add your own events and view these as part
of the trace.
By the way, there are mailing lists for LTT if you're interested to
make a contribution.
Cheers,
Karim
