Subject: [patch 2.6.25-rc2-git] gpio:  <linux/gpio.h> and "no GPIO support here" stubs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/22/559

Add a <linux/gpio.h> defining fail/warn stubs for GPIO calls on platforms
that don't support the GPIO programming interface.  That includes the
arch-specific implementation glue otherwise.
This facilitates a new model for GPIO usage:  drivers that can use GPIOs
if they're available, but don't require them.  One example of such a
driver is NAND driver for various FreeScale chips.  On platforms update
with GPIO support, they can be used instead of a worst-case delay to
verify that the BUSY signal is off.
(Also includes a couple minor unrelated doc updates.)

 There are other system-specific mechanisms that are not specified here,
