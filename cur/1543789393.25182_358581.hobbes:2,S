ugh, what were they about then, poetry?
Ah i think i know what you mean: these were about a PREVIOUS VERSION of 
the patch, and hence they fell off the face of the earth, regardless of 
their content, right? What a tricky little definition of "Thomas replied 
only 3 times" ...

your latest mail with the list of 'open' issues seems to contradict your 
assertion that the above 3 mails from Thomas where "the only mails 
related to the patch". E.g.:
' - "timer API" vs "timeout API": I got absolutely no acknowlegement 
     that this might be a little confusing and in consequence "process 
     timer" may be a better name. '
was raised and discussed in the first chunk of mails just as well.
