A power failure is a different thing from a power button press. There are
users (me for example) who want to have something different then "init 0"
mapped to the power button, for example a sleep state (since my box
doesn't have a dedicated sleep button). I doubt there are many people who
want something else than a shutdown if the power is out (although I think
there will be with suspend-to-disk working, so we might have to change UPS
handling here).
My plan for power management was to have a special daemon that would
decide what to do based on system state (battery status, local time, ...)
and events (power/sleep button, last user logged out, ...) [I know that
from a programmer's POV, both are events]. This daemon could, for example,
make sure that no services are affected, for example by priming WOL and
entering a not-so-deep sleep state instead of doing a suspend-to-disk if
someone is still listening on a port after the "shutdown unimportant
services" scripts have been run.
