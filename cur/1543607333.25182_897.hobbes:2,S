UGLY!
two VM is one kernel is a nonsense. To develop an OS you have to do also
choices like this. I already wrote what i think of those VMs, they
are both usefull, but with different conditions and with different
worksload and HWs, depending on the behaviour you need.
Rik and Andrea know my point of view, I need a predictable VM for mission
critical USE, on desktop people will need the fastest VM for low memory
systems.
But to manage the development implys a choice, that could be different
for different branches, but anyway someone has to say, "This is the
right VM for this kernel, for what I think this kernel should
do"!
