I thought that for 4GB of memory the CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G is not set
would be enough.
From looking in source code the CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G is broken in many respects,
in my opinion. It's really a 64-bit with 32-bit quirks enabled. Does it even
run on None 64-bit machines? Not many! 
You have a magnificent 64-bit Machine, why?
