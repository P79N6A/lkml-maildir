For some reason, I cant even make config, make menuconfig or anything like
that. I did find something weird when I tried the 2.4.21 kernel .. Did make
menuconfig and nothing showed up on screen except Load Alternate config and
Save.. 
I think its only a variable that I need to set but I don't know where to
look. Help
