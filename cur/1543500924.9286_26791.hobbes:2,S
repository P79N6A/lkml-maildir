I've seen this twice on 2.2.10:
Supermicro P6DGU P2-400 x 2
128MB
AIC7895 SCSI
2 x IBM 9.1G UW SCSI drives
When I get home, I'll see if I still have the logs to post.
This is very intermittant, takes about 2-3 days to occur.
I think both times, it occurred at 4am when cron ran
the update command for the locate program. At the time the
only other things running would be a couple of instances of
seti@home.
I tried to reproduct it by just banging on the machine with
bonnie, then bonnie and heavy net traffic, and then multiple
bonnies, heavy net traffic and lots of processes to get a load
of 30+, but was never able to force this error.
