For those who did not see my original post, I had a problem with my new
Tyan 1590 Super Socket 7 mobo running a AMD K6-3 450mhz with 128mb of
PC100 RAM. I also have a Gravis Ultrasound MAX sound card (ISA).
Whenever I used the sound card, my PC would hang hard forcing a reset or
power off. I was able to easily reproduce the hang by playing MP3s and
either locking the screen or by simply doubling the size of my XMMS
window, obviously causing a fair amount of video updating. I also
noticed that switching desktops in Enlightenment seemed to force the
hang. It also locked up last night when I was not using the sound card
at all (modules unloaded and commented out of conf.modules). 
What was done to find the problem, well quite a lot over the past 2-3
days:
- Checked the IRQ and DMA settings for all cards. No conflicts. Tried
different IRQ settings for all cards.  Played with the PnP BIOS changing
the IRQ and DMA settings to/from PnP. Still hangs. 
- I tried another sound card, same result.
- Downloaded the latest Tyan BIOS version 1.16. no change. 
- I found a readme file in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/sound/VIA-chipset that described the same  
problem I was having. I followed instructions and it still hung.
- Turned off APM in BIOS, no change.
- I removed all my ISA cards except for my sound card, still hangs. 
- It was suggested that I make sure PCI quirks and other IDE and PCI
related kernel settings were on, they were. 
- A few people suggest turning off 'PCI Peer Concurrency' in my BIOS. I
am using Award BIOS and they do not support that option. AMI I
understand does. 
- I rebuilt my kernel with a bare minimum of built in drivers, still
hangs. 
- It was suggested that I use the pciutils package to disable Peer
Concurrency. I did not know the options to the setpci command but
thought maybe Award would be able to help. They had no clue. 
- I called Tyan tech support. It was suggested that I drop my bus speed
to 95mhz or lower to see if my memory supported the 100mhz bus speeds. I
went as low as 66mhz, still hangs. 
- Finally it was suggested that I turn off 'CPU to PCI buffering'.
Bingo! No lockups for 9+ hours. I have been playing MP3s continuously
for 9 hours now with no lock ups. I have tried everything I can to force
the lock up. Right now I am quite confident that my problem is solved. 
Thanks to Heinz Diehl for suggesting that I turn off "CPU to PCI
buffering" in my Award BIOS. Heinz had a number of suggestions to fix
the problem. 
Also thanks to the following people who took the time to suggest
workarounds to my problem:
	John Stultz
 	Andrea Arcangeli
	Dan Hollis
	Neil Schemenauer
I plan on following through with Tyan to see why the CPU to PCI
buffering has to be disabled on the Tyan 1590 board. I am not sure if
it's related to just the motherboard, the processor, the memory or what
but I hope to find out. I will post what I find out here. 
Thanks to everyone again!
