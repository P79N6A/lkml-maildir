Answer : The owner of the floppy ( more precisely the owner of /dev/fd0
).
The owner of this file is usually set to the user who is logged in on
the console ( it makes no sense to bug some remote user to insert a
floppy ).
So when the situation arises :
If the user is logged on via X11 , display a dialog.
If on console , just write some msg to /dev/console.
This should be done by some daemon , off-course.
And the man who said 'Think about kerneld/kmod/whatever it is this week'
probably mean't "use an userland demon, in concept similar to the kmod
stuff",
and not use kerneld-V2.0.1 .
