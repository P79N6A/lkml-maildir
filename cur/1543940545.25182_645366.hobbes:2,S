Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, please pull the latest x86 git tree from:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git
Find the shortlog attached below.
Most of the changes we have described here:
    
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/21/230
It's not a small merge, it consists of 908 commits from 96 individual 
arch/x86 developers (!):
    671 files changed, 42791 insertions(+), 38967 deletions(-)
so here are a few highlevel comments as well, in addition to the 
shortlog:
- a number of core files are changed as well: most notably percpu,
  debugging details, timers, the firewire remote debugging patch and ...
  the KGDB remote debugging stub in kernel/kgdb.c.
- we tested KGDB to be merge-worthy within the x86 architecture (the 
  only supported architecture for now) and it's better to have 
  kernel/kgdb.c than arch/x86/kernel/kgdb.c. The code is reasonably 
  clean and the user-space exposure is small - the only real exposure is 
  the decades-old remote GDB protocol. We are happy to fix up any 
  further cleanliness comments that people might have - but we really 
  wanted to start somewhere and get this thing moving. As an added 
  bonus: finally a kernel debugger that can be read without puking too
  much ;-) [anyone remember KDB?]
- the core timer and genirq changes are pushed via x86.git for 
  convenience reasons, we tested them inside x86.git for a long time.
- the module loader bits have been seen and acked by Rusty - work is 
  going on in parallel to make those bits cleaner, but they are no 
  merge-stopper for him now.
- the ptrace/regset bits from Roland are tied to x86 regset support and 
  affect no other architecture. (but they enable easy regset merging for 
  other architectures in the future)
- the lockbreak cleanup patches are tied to the ticket spinlocks and big 
  ticket spinlocks - hence the changes to fs/*.
- the changes to agp drivers are mechanic, due to the CPA API cleanups 
  and fixes. Behavior is not supposed to change, a number of drivers 
  were tested in that category and no breakage is known at the moment. 
  (see further below about the CPA changes)
- a sizable portion of the queue is the 120 patches strong CPA/ioremap 
  rewrite. Tons of bugs fixed and we now think it's a dependable basis. 
  Because this is the riskiest item we've placed it near the end of our
  queue, in a way that makes it easy to revert/mute the riskiest (or
  all) aspects of these changes. [ NOTE: these CPA fixes, due to their 
  intrusiveness are not backmergable into v2.6.24. Sorry about that, but
  pushing 100+ patches into stable is just not realistic. ]
- the PAT patches are not included yet - they were breaking too many 
  boxes and were exposing too many hardware details that we are 
  neither handling right nor do we have them all mapped yet to a 
  sufficient degree. Also, the basic CPA machinery has to be dependable 
  before we can start putting in the hard cache attribute constraints 
  that PAT requires. The CPA changes are fully compatible with all known 
  driver details and there's no known breakage at the moment.
- there's full 64-bit paravirt support now - but no hypervisor bindings 
  yet. These might show up a bit later as they are rather isolated (in 
  fact i'd expect them to show up real soon ;) - important was to get 
  the core changes cleaned up, integrated and tested.
- PIE/brk randomization. Not a single regression happened due to this so 
  far (and it's been in x86.git for months) - it seems exec-shield has
  rooted out stuff years ago - but we'll see. Details in the patch. It's 
  easily revertable in any case.
- new debugging feature: init memory permanently unmapped from the 
  direct mappings, to catch __init section bugs faster. This could 
  trigger in other subsystems. Right now dependent on 
  CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y.
- if we forgot to mention any important item it's due to sheer
  exhaustion :-/ Please ask and we'll explain anything that is missing.
the x86.git queue has been built and booted on 32-bit and 64-bit x86, 
allnoconfig and allyesconfig [the new CONFIG_SIS190 gigabit driver in 
-git has been disabled because it has build failures], including a real 
legacy i386 DX 33 MHz system which successfully booted x86.git today.
In the past few weeks tens of thousands of random x86.git bzImages were 
successfully built and booted on a number of (commodity) 32-bit and 
64-bit testsystems - and there has been a fair amount of test exposure 
on -mm as well. We expect the x86.git changes to be pretty robust - if 
any problems there are they should be under more specialized conditions. 
(or due to very recent changes that we kept at the tail of the commit 
list) Famous last words? :)
