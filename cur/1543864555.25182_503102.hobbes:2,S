I expect an msleep(1) will be OK, if you can indeed sleep on this
codepath.  Yes, that can delay for longer: ten milliseconds for sure
if HZ=100.
If that's a problem I guess you could spin for a millisecond or two, then
start sleeping:
	end = jiffies + msecs_to_jiffies(400);
	while (time_before(jiffies, end)) {
		loop++;
		...
		if (loop < 5)
			mdelay(1);
		else
			msleep(1);
	}
or something like that.
