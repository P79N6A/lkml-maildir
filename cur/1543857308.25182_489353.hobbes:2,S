Hello,
I've send 2 patches for a DTS/DSR handshaking to the list
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/5/7/76
  and long long time ago 1998
My problem are manufacturers the make printers with
DTR/DSR Handschaking. POS Printers are very sensible for
a buffer overrun!
For on or two printers, we can wire a adapter, for 10000...30000
printers is a software option the better way.
I've write a patch for 2.2 and published it, 
I've write a patch for 2.4 and published it, but i've see there is no
DTR/DSR Handshaking in the kernel 2.6.
I'm a litte bit  frusted. Are a few  thousands pos-systems not
enough for upgrading the standard kernel sources?
Have I a really chance to commit a patch for kernel 2.6.
What is the best way to handle this problem.
Thanks for comments ;-)
Michael Westermann
