No, I still get them in 2.6.4
To my knowledge, they only happen when one thread is blocked in a system 
call
and another thread makes a system("foo bar") call.
The blocked thread will return with EINTR.
I see this usually in sem_wait, but also in epoll_wait sometimes.
Is it possible system() is causing the wrong process to get woken up?
Let me know if you need any further information, I can reproduce it 
consistently.
