Subject: more pedantry:  "depends on" versus "depends" versus "requires"

  i'm thinking that the kconfig structure doesn't really need to
support all three of these dependency directives for Kconfig files.  a
quick occurrence count:
  "depends on":	4421
  "depends":	45
  "requires":	0
  under the circumstances, why not just standardize on "depends on"
everywhere and remove the obvious redundancy from the scripts/kconfig/
parser files?
