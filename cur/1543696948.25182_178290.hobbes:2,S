The problematic part are "correct sequence numbers" here. These numbers in 
the commit list mails are pretty much useless. At least the numbers in 
this line:
#                  ChangeSet    1.1437+1.1350.5.10 -> 1.1438
have to be replaced with a unique identifier. This identifier does exist, 
e.g. it's visible in the exclude mails.
As soon as someone finds out how to export changesets in this format and 
stores them somewhere, other people can make use of this data. 
Unfortunately it's rather unlikely that anyone who can do the first, knows 
also how to do the latter (but maybe Larry can tell us the trick).
Anyway, if someone has this data I'd be interested in a copy.
bye, Roman
