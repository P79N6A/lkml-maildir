The below kind of increment is fine for a volatile variable. It's at least
what I expect the compiler doing for me.
        movl foo,%eax            ! Get it
        leal 1(%eax),%edx        ! bump it by one
        movl %edx,foo            ! write it back

Yes, more economical way for eyes.

lost_ticks_system is _not_ declared as volatile. And lost_ticks doesn't
need to be declared volatile as well, but not declaring it volatile won't
make any difference looking how it's used.
Only jiffies needs to be declared volatile because of free readers.
