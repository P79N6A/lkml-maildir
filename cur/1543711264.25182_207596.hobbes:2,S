Some suse 8.2 kernels had write barriers for IDE, some did not.  If
you're running any kind of recent suse kernel, you're doing cache
flushes on fsync with ext3.
Not sure if RH has ever carried the patches or not.  Easy enough to test
for on suse, just look for blk_queue_ordered in the System.map.

Then it sounds like your 2.4 is doing flushes.  I'd expect this test to
run very quickly without them.
