I am assuming that is a requirement that it is possible for software
to bring a device out of the state is place in by the ->shutdown method.
->shutdown is called on the reboot path and if it results in a pure
software only reboot (i.e. the reset line on the motherboard is not toggled),
then the device driver for the OS loaded after the reboot must reinitialize it.

Yes.  My point is that I don't especially like having an additional argument
as that introduces more conditional control flow cases.  My experience
suggests unconditional control flow is more likely to be implemented properly.

If it can be done reasonably I am for it.

Except that kexec suffers from the same class of issues a cooperative
multitasking (every component must do the right thing), it is quite
simple.  All of my code paths are written assuming they are the slow
uncommon path, so they place the smallest possible burden on the rest
of the kernel.

I think I now see where you are coming from.  Instead of changing the
production code paths.  Introducing a set of testing code paths to
assist with driver testing.  At least that is the feel I am getting.
