Not that I know of. BTW: I don't really see how your scheme would
work, since I don't think you could "make an empty map" anyway. All
you could do is find a vacant region in VM, and mmap() a single page
at a time as you needed it. That's horrible.

You don't need to hack the VM layer to do this. You could probably
implement it in a device driver which provided a mmap()able
device. But the problem is you'd need root privileges to load the
module.

You have an evil sense of humour.
