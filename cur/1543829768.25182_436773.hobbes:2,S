Hi,
at first I got nervous about the asymmetry of this (eg why only do this
copying only on entry, and not a copy back on exit)... but then again
these bits shouldn't change so your patch is ok as is...
it's regrettable that we need to add this for the softirq accounting;
part of me wishes we would just count irq-vs-user time and be done with
it ;)
