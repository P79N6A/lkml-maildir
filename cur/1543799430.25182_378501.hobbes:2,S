-rt deals with this using priority sorted wait queue and direct ownership
hand off to the woken thread. It's working fine for now, but things like
wake-all and company should probably be explored for various uses. A
strict general purpose and RT usage of the Linux kernel have different
performance characteristic and mutex selection at compile time should
address things precisely.
