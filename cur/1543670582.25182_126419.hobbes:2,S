Btw, why would you _want_ your redirect table to look like that?

Starting at 31 is better, because..

Then we'd have devices at 81 and 89 (two per block of 16 is ok, but 80
isn't ok because we use that for system calls).
And having two devices in the 8x series means that it takes more irq
sources to overflow and start to re-use the 3x block - and we want to
delay re-using the 3x block as long as possible due to the silly "only
one pending irq per block" rule that some intel APIC's have.
So that's why FIRST_DEVICE_VECTOR is normally 31 - because it gives a
nicer pattern for the first round of allocations, and that's the common
case (machines with hundreds of APIC irq sources are still rare, the
common case is a single IOAPIC with 24 or so pins).
