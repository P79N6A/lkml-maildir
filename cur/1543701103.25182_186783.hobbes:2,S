The messages jump around fast and there is no possibility to scroll
back once the kernel stops, but I am convinced that nothing is said about
detecting the device.
However, if booting the kernel "normally", the device gets detected (later).
How do I use the console? Is it something like nullmodem cable console in
Windows NT?  I have given away my nullmodem cable to a friend for purpose of
debugging NT kernel so what possibilities remain?
