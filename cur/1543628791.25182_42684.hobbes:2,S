What you say is true enough if you speak for yourself and/or the core
cadre of kernel maintainers.  On the other hand, the linux-kernel list
has been and mostly continues to be a good place to get help with
problems related to kernel changes that affect non-GPL modules.
To put it another way, the kernel developers aren't necessarily the
target audience when a request for assistance is posted to linux-kernel.
If that was too subtle, kernel developers aren't the only people who
read linux-kernel.  Is linux-kernel an appropriate venue for such
assistance requests?  Maybe not the *most* appropriate one, but it's
often the most efficient.  Let me put it this way: speaking for myself,
I don't ask linux-kernel list readers for help with a problem if the
problem isn't the immediate result of a kernel change.
