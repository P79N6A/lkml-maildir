Great!
Running wine as an ISO task will give it short periods of high priority
over and above your web browser - that's the point since it is soft real
time scheduling.
You may want to try disabling the interactive setting as well
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/interactive
as some very resource hungry applications (eg games and perhaps wine)
seem better behaved in that setting too.
Thanks for feedback.
