The problem still remains in 2.6 that we limit the count to 256.  I've 
attached a quick patch that I've compiled and tested.  I don't know if 
there is a better way to handle dynamic assignment of minors (haven't 
kept up to date in that realm), but if there is, then we should probably 
  use it instead.
