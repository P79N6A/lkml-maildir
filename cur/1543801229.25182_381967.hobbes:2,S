I'm talking about replacing:
	<caller>:		call
	mutex_lock:		 lock decl
	mutex_lock:		 js
	.text.lock.mutex:	  call
	__mutex_lock:		   ret
	.text.lock.mutex:	  jmp
	mutex_lock:		 ret
	<caller>:		...
With:
	<caller>:		call
	mutex_lock:		 lock decl
	mutex_lock:		 js
	.text.lock.mutex:	  jmp
	__mutex_lock:		   ret
	<caller>:		...
Or:
	<caller>:		call
	mutex_lock:		 lock decl
	mutex_lock:		 js
	__mutex_lock:		  ret
	<caller>:		...
This sort of thing is done by the compiler when it does tail-calling.

In what way would this be unbalanced? You end up with one fewer CALL and one
fewer RET instruction. And why would the CPU think this is any different from
a function with a conditional branch in it? Eg:
	<caller>:		call
	mutex_lock:		 lock decl
	mutex_lock:		 js
	mutex_lock:		 ret
	<caller>:		...
The only route to __mutex_lock would be through mutex_lock...
Are there docs on this feature of the x86 anywhere?
