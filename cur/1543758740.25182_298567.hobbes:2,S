Heh. Let me brag about it a little:
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : CentaurHauls
cpu family      : 5
model           : 4

$ uname -a
Linux kawasaki 2.6.10-rc3 #3 Fri Dec 17 21:44:53 CET 2004 i586 unknown
$ uptime
 19:00:14 up 58 days,  1:21,  1 user,  load average: 0.37, 0.17, 0.11
Running 2.6 at least since 2.6.0-test11-wli-something, dated Dec 6 2003  
according to /boot (may have been running other 2.6-test before, but I  
dont have them around any longer):
$ ls -al /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.0-test11
-rw-r-----    1 root     root       840607 Dec  6  2003 /boot/vmlinuz- 
2.6.0-test11-wli
Not a single hiccup, so far *knock on wood*. Bragging even further, I  
also have a genuine 80386 DX 33 up and running, although that one is  
still on 2.0.37, iirc.
Oh, yes, I'm a loonie ;-)
