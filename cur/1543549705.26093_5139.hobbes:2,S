Granted that smaller apps can help -- for a particular workload.  But while I
am very partial to BusyBox (in fact I am about to cut a new release) I can
assure you that OOM is easily possible even when your user space is tiny.  I do
it all the time.  There are mallocs in busybox and when under memory pressure,
the kernel still tends to fall over...
