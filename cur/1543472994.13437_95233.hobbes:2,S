Hello,
My school's SMTP server doesn't seem to reply to large-ish email messages. If
I send a small one (like this), it works fine. But if the message is slightly
larger (say 20 lines of text), it just sits there waiting for the final reply.
I just wanted to make sure this has nothing to do with the kernel before I
bitched to them about it.
Thanks,
m.
