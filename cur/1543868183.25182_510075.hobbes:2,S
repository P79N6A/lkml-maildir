I think you might have misunderstood becaues I do beleive it's actually
very general :-)

This is roughly similar to the cell "toplevel" model where interrupt
messages encode the source unit/node, target and class. The chip has an
interrupt "controller" (receiver of those messages) for each thread. In
the kernel, I use a "flat" model, that is I create one host for all of
them and my hardware numbers are mode of a similar bit encoding of those
"routing" infos.
That is, with a remapping model like mine, the x86 non-legacy situation
could be easily expressed by having one domain (I call them hosts in the
code) covering the whole fabric and the hw number be your (CPU << 16) |
vector thing.
In addition, but you don't need that on x86, cell has an external
controller cascaded on one of those interrupt, I use a separate domain
for it.
The reason my hwnumber thingy is a generic type is that i provide
generic functions to create a linux interrupt for a domain/number pair
and generic mecanism to do the reverse mapping. That's where I think my
code might be of some use as with the "numbers" going away, pretty
everybody will need a wat to reverse map from HW numbers back to
irq_desc *.
I use an unsigned long because I needed to choose a type that would fit
the biggest number potentially used by an interrupt controller, and that
can be real big with some hypervisors for which those are "tokens" which
are potentially 64 bits.

So you do intend to keep the linux number which is what I call the
"virtual interrupt" number on powerpc... I wouldn't have thought that to
be necessary except as a special case of an array of 16 entries for ISA
interrupts...

It would be fairly easy to change my powerpc code to pre-allocate a full
range for a given domain/pic when initializing it instead of doing
"lazy" scattered allocation like I do, though it won't bring much I
think. It's not possible for all PICs though, for example, the pSeries
needs to use the radix tree reverse mapper because of how large HW
interrupt numbers can be.
I chose not to do it. In the long run, the only remotely meaningful way
to expose interrupt to users would be to -add- columns
to /proc/interrupts that provide the "host" and the HW number on that
host, though I'm not sure that wouldn't break some userland tools.

I don't understand why you would go to all that lenght to replace irq
numbers with irq_desc * and ... keep then numbers :-)
But again, as I said, this is in no way a fundamental limitation of the
powerpc code. It could be modified easily to allocate the whole range of
a given PIC that uses the "linear" remapping. It makes no sense for PICs
that use the "radix tree" remapping though.

I fait to see how what I described would not apply nicely to x86 ..
