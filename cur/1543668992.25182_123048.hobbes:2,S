Good question to illustrate with.
Extra spacing added just for ease of reading:
0-150 -> 150-200 -> 200-300 -> 300-400 -> 400-500 -> 500-999
 A          A          A          A          A          A
 B          B
            C          C          C 
                                  D          D          
                                  E          E

We can always leave the sys_remap_file_pages stuff using pte_chains,
and should certainly do that at first. But doing it for normal stuff
should be less controversial, I think.
