Exactly. I hooked up a PATA CDROM temporarily when I changed the mobo,
but otherwise the only storage it has is that SATA disk.

Do you think that this problem is caused by or at least triggered by
Linux or it's disk usage patterns? At least if you type "b200000000070f0f"
into g00gle you get a lot of hits all of which has something to do with
Linux.

Well I have to admit I'm not a kernel hacker but a simple user without a clue
so I have no idea how I could have got a stack trace from a kernel that is
paniced, frozen hard, and couldn't even sync it's disks so after I realized
there is no reaction to any input devices on the system I've just hit the
reset button and hoped it will come up again. I guess this is exactly what
Windo$$$ users used to do when they get a blue screen... ;)
Thanks!
