Actually I don't think so:
- X and games need hard interactivity: they have to compute fast a
response to an input.
- xine can precompute a few frames if it wants (I dunno if it does) and
just needs a precise timing to display them and sync the audio buffers.
It could do with CPU slices if X does the right 'display this frame at
this time' thing.
