I don't know. 
I've built the osdb test while I've just installed postgres
from the Mandrake 9 standard installation (so i586.rpm).
May be we are using different version of postgres...
Anyway, my test show that there is a lack of performance 
in 2.5.* is the kernel fits in a machine with low memory,
any hint ?
And probably the "standard" swappiness value is not the 
optimal, I'd like to see a few tests with the contest
tool ;-)
      Ciao,
               Paolo
