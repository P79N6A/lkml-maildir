Hi.
Interesting turn in my efforts to make linux boot on my newly acquired
old computer: Mike Galbraith offered me IKD for 2.4.0t8, which I
accepted and tried (I said yes to all the IKD config options). This
made 2.4.0t8 boot and get as far as complaining about bad root fs
(which is correct for it to barf over). However, right after
'Uncompressing linux....' I get a columnfull (12 characters from left
edge in, top to bottom) of random characters with "unconventional"
color and background. The last 7 of these change rapidly, the list 5
faster.These seem to stay on top as the boot messages goes normally
from there. They do not show up in the serial dump (not surprising).
So adding IKD to 2.4.0t8 made the initial oops go away/be hidden.
Status: 2.2.17 (double) oopses, 2.4.0t8 oopses, 2.4.0t8-ikd boots with
wierdnesses.
It should also be mentioned that all these problems persist across
a change of RAM to 64MB (from a machine that runs 2.2.16 without
problems).
