The one "close" to the floppy, of course.  Associate consoles and devices.
If a network user is accessing the floppy sitting next to my keyboard and I
\ull the floppy out, I should be the one to get the notice.  If I have two
complete heads sitting on a machine and a USB floppy sitting there next to
:1, then the user logged into :1 should get the notice if they pull the
floppy.
I'm sure the person inventive enough to work out the infrastructure for
having the kernel alert a userspace notification daemon would be smart
enough to allow for a device->console mapping.
