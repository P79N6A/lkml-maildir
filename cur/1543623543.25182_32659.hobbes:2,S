If no show-stopper bugreport comes in in the following days, I'll submit a
patch (marked sis5513.c v0.13 final) with debug mode deactivated to lkml,
you and Marcelo that will address this.
So lkml SiS chipset owners, please stress the 20020304_1 patch
available at:
http://inet6.dyn.dhs.org/sponsoring/sis5513/index.html
As I lack test reports on some chip generations, if people with a SiS530,
540,620 or SiS5511,5513 chip would take the time to mail me test results
with this patch, that would be perfect.
LB.
