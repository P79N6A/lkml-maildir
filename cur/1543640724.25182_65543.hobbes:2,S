I started using it again recently.  I really like it.  I believe the
package on oss.sgi.com doesn't include a graphical monitoring package.
I don't think SGI ever released that for Linux, which is too bad because
it's really cool[1].  
Michal Kara worked on creating a graphical monitoring package called
PCPMON[2] but I haven't tried it out yet.
