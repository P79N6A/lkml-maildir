Yes, but ideally this kludge would go away...

That sounds like a lot of overhead.  In particular it means we keep
converting to and from `virtual IRQs'.  I would hope the MSI work would
allow us to tie in at a lower level than virtual interrupts.  I was
thinking an interface would look something like:
void *request_msi(struct device *dev,
		irqreturn_t (*handler)(int, void *, struct pt_regs *),
		unsigned long irqflags,
                void *dev_id)
You need a struct device to figure out which interrupt controller it
needs.
