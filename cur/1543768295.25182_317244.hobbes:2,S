No:
$ cat /etc/modprobe.d/test
install test-module /tmp/test-program 1
install test-module /tmp/test-program 2
$ cat /tmp/test-program
#!/bin/sh -e
echo $* > /tmp/test-log
$ modprobe --verbose test-module
install /tmp/test-program 2
$ cat /tmp/test-log 
2
$
And if both commands were to be run, it would break in a different way
(blacklisting would not work).

Eventually yes if nobody else will beat me, but I cannot spend time on
