The scsi multi-path patch is not in Rusty's list.
It includes modifications for the aic, qlogic, ips and 53c700 scsi host
adapter drivers, but not for all the other host adapter drivers.
The patch is not hardware specific, but it does require changes in list
traversal that are used by all (or nearly all) the scsi adapter drivers.
