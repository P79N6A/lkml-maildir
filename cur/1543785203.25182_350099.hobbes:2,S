NFS uses XDR to encode C strings.  They are encoded as counted byte arrays
and are _not_ null terminated.  The space containing the string is rounded
up to the next 4 byte boundary though and, usually, this space is zero 
filled.
The number of bytes in the string is encoded as a big endian integer in the
first four bytes.
    Thanx...
