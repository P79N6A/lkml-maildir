The packet #0 message is not causing any trouble.
The wheel will work in X with mouse set to imps/2, in XF86Config(-4):
Section "InputDevice"
..
    Option "Protocol"    "ImPS/2"
    Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
...
EndSection
Button on left may act same as middle button, at least for me it is and
nicer to use.
Mouse position loose seems to be caused by strange messages from mouse:
is your mouse wireless too ?
Here is a patch that works for me: note that it is too ugly for real
inclusion and may cause troubles in other setups. But you can try it if
you want. I have sent it to maintainer too, maybe a better solution will
arrive in future kernels.
