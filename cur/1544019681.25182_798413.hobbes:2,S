Subject: [PATCH 1/4] reparent_thread: don't call kill_orphaned_pgrp() if task_detached()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

If task_detached(p) == T, then either
	a) p is not the main thread, we will find the group leader
	   on the ->children list.
or
	b) p is the group leader but its ->exit_state = EXIT_DEAD.
	   This can only happen when the last sub-thread has died,
	   but in that case that thread has already called
	   kill_orphaned_pgrp() from exit_notify().
In both cases kill_orphaned_pgrp() looks bogus.
Move the task_detached() check up and simplify the code, this is also
right from the "common sense" pov: we should do nothing with the detached
childs, except move them to the new parent's ->children list.
