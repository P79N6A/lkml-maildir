Subject: [PATCH 2.4.0] agpgart support for i815 not using on-board video
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/11/14/150

the agp driver for the i810/i815 is designed to support the 810/815's
on-board i7xx video. the i815 (which can use on-board video or a seperate
AGP 2x/4x/Pro card) does not function with this driver when using a
seperate AGP card.
the 440LX/BX/GX and 840 agp driver does work, however, if
agp_try_unsupported is set to 1 -- they all share the same generic Intel
AGP interface, the driver just does not detect the i815.
this patch, against 2.4.0-test11-pre5, adds specific support for the 815
to the 440LX/BX/GX/840 driver, so agp_try_unsupported need not be set, and
the i815 is detected and handled properly.
the patch also updates the configure docs to show that CONFIG_AGP_INTEL
now supports the i815, and CONFIG_AGP_I810 supports the i815 when using
the on-board video only.
ive been using this patch for a couple days with no problem, and
agp_try_unsupported=1 for many months ... DRI works great with it.
my system is an ASUS CUSL2 with a Matrox G400.
