The problem is that the "common pool" ends up being a very wide swamp
very fast.  The last few times I've needed any instrumentation in the
kernel, I was chasing slab leaks, and didn't need precise timing or
latency measurements.  On the other hand, the RT guys probably don't
care all that much about slab events, but need timing and latency.
Then there's other guys that don't care about slab, timing, or latency,
but do care about some other events.
So under your plan, all 3 groups now use a "common pool" that includes
slap, timing, latency, and other stuff - and nobody's using more than
1/3 of it, but paying the performance penalty for the 2/3 unused hooks....
