   OK, You have right, I'm not a driver programmer, but it probably should
   look like this:
   +#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_OXSEMI_16PCI954   0x9501
That's correct, yes.  The reason why the original poster was having
problems was that the serial_compat.h defined PCI_VENDOR_ID_OXSEMI
PCI_DEVICE_ID_OXSEMI_16PCI954 if PCI_VENDOR_ID_OXSEMI was not defined.
Since 2.2.18 defines PCI_VENDOR_ID_OXSEMI, but ..._OXSEMI_16PCI954, the
5.05 serial.c wouldn't compile.  
When we integrate a newer serial driver into 2.2.19, I'll include the
necessary patches to pci_ids.h.  
   Why serial.c from the 2.2.18 not support 921600 speed? We have to patch
   it...
2.2.18 has an old serial driver that doesn't know about PCI devices.
The updated serial driver available at 
http://serial.sourceforge.net
should deal with this correctly.
