IMHO, the massive file corruption that results on a vanilla Linux
system is what's not ready for prime time. I've been running the
1.2.2a patch on Linux 2.2.5 for a couple of weeks now, serving 60 HPUX 
and Solaris boxes without any noticeable problem, whereas before the
server was unusable.
Since this problem has been around for years without a fix getting
into the mainline kernel, unless there's some known problem with the
patches, I don't see a downside.
