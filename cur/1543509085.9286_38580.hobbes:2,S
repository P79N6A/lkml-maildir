Subject: Urgent Need: Ensure certain interfaces don't ARP reply, esp. lo:0

For certain high transaction rate clustering situations (specifically
LinuxDirector with Direct Routing), it is required that certain interfaces
(normally a loopback alias) do not generate ARP replies.  The reason for this
is that there is a router device (the LinuxDirector director) that is acting
as the incoming router for load distribution (a type of reverse NAT).  This is
state of the art, although layer three analysis and routing is the next step.
The notes for LinuxDirector mention that Solaris, Linux 2.0.36, and 2.2.10
with the LinuxDirector patch will not ARP reply for the IP address attached to
lo:0.  Unfortunately I have currently settled on 2.2.13Pre6 as a stable kernel
and this is a problem for me.
Using arpwatch I can see ARP replies from both the director and servers.
It would be nice if there were a way to configure an interface to explicitly
disable ARP replies.  Is this possible now?
If I were to add it, what method would be most desirable?  /proc/net/*,
fattening the ifconfig interfaces a little?
Thanks!
