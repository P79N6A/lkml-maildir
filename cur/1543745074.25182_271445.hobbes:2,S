I believe this patch is required because the original gdt is not addressable
via the low mapping page table (set by acpi_save_state_mem and used for wakeup
code), not the GDTR's linear address size reason.
cc:Shaohua and Len
wakeup_gdt2.patch should be slightestly modified to wakeup_gdt_2.6.10.patch
because %edx is conflict with msr's patch in 2.6.10-rc2 or later.
thanks
