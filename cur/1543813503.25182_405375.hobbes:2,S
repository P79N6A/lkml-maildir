Yes, we can ship it ourselves.  But a significant point of this exercise
is to have the drivers be available to people who use unmodified
distros, and don't want to download other bits to do so.
If Greg can get SUSE to turn on debugfs, that's great.  I can ask Dave
Jones or Doug Ledford or some other Fedora/RedHat kernel person to do
likewise, but they're not beholden to me in any way, so god knows what
my chances are :-)
The "have it just work in vendor distros" notion is also why the OpenIB
community as a whole is focusing on rolling out a 1.0 release of the IB
userspace code, so that people can expect their distros to simply work
with Infiniband hardware.
