It isn't that simple. The LPC bridge also contains the controls for the
joystick ports. You also need them for hotplug handling of the bridge
should someone stick one in a laptop docking station. The ID table also
ensures the driver is loaded. It's probably true that it will need
splitting up a bit if another driver also needs ownership of the LPC
bridge but for now that hasn't happened.
Also a lot of other vendors Midi and joystick ports do have PCI ids.
