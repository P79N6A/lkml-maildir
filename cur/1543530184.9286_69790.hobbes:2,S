Mar 16 09:32:51 ns kernel: hda: no DRQ after issuing WRITE 
Mar 16 09:32:52 ns kernel: ide0: reset: success 
I'm using RedHat 6.0 (kernel 2.2.5-22). My hda is SEAGATE ST34311A.
I found the similar question in the mailing list archive. The answer was
to get a kernel patch in
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hedrick/.
 This directory
contains patches for 2.2.13 kernel, but I'm using 2.2.5-22.
Is there a way to solve this problem without upgrading the kernel?
