Er, because the 'tick' is a valid count of the actual time that the
system has been running, while the "boot time" is totally meaningless.
What if the system has no RTC, or the RTC is wrong until later in the
boot sequence when it can be set by the user/ntpd?  What if you pass
daylight savings time?  Does your uptime increase/decrease by an hour?
Cheers, Andreas
