In commit fba2591bf4e418b6c3f9f8794c9dd8fe40ae7bd9
test_clear_page_dirty was removed a couple of days ago.
Now when I try and build I get this:
WARNING: "test_clear_page_dirty" [fs/cifs/cifs.ko] undefined!
This is caused by line 1248 of fs/cifs/file.c
			if (PageWriteback(page) ||
					!test_clear_page_dirty(page)) {
This isn't my area of expertise so I'm not providing a fix as I'm sure
I'll get it wrong!
My apologies if people have already fixed as I'm not on all the relevant lists.
Regards,
Ian
