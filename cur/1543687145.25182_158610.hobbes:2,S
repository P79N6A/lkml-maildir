Correct, but we don't do that

You increase it and you shortcut on shared lans. Thats really a seperate
issue to the question of which source is used. If you loopback someone
elses address on your own lo device I'm not suprised weird shit happens,
put the alias on eth0 where it belongs.

Not in general. If you are using ARP your lan is hardly "secure". For
most situations the trust across multiple aggregated lans is the same,
if it isnt people use vlan (which rarely helps 8))
