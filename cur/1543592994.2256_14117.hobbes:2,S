lspci -vxxx -s 00:07.0
the APIC sits in the southbridge.
the low 2 bits of offset 0x58 must be set [route USB IRQ to APIC], and 
lspci -vx -s 00:07.2
offset 0x3C must be set to 3 [19 & 15]
There was some discussion about the same problem with the sound part of
the southbridge.
What are the current values of these registers?
