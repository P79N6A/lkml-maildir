I'll get to that, working my way through the first batch of testing on a NUMA platform. [[If anybody has ideas on specific testing to do, that would be helpful.]] I do plan on running some AIM7 tests, as those have shown improvement in other types of affinity changes in the kernel, and some of them have "interesting" IO load characteristics.
