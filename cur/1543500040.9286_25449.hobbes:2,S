great.

i dont think so. But the next stable release is not far away. The
development branch will always have 'cool stuff, wish we had that in the
stable branch too', hopefully in the future stable branches will follow up
each other with higher frequency.

definitely! Many of the improvements show up in a magnified way on 4k
block filesystems. It would be very interesting to see the same
measurement done on a 4k-blocksize testpartition. 
as a rule of thumb, ext2 filesystems should always be created with 4k
blocksize, unless there will be lots of small files on the filesystem.
(typically not the case with most database systems)

ps. be careful with that production system though, even pre2-2.3.8 has
    known, serious, not yet fixed bugs which might corrupt files.
