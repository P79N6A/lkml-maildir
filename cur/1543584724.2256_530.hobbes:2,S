Subject: ac97_codec: AD1885 id 0x41445360 changed to 0x41445460 in 2.4.2-ac patches?

Alan,
Last night I moved from an old BX/PII board to an i815e/PIII
board (an Intel D815EEA with an AD1885 and onboard LAN enabled),
and in trying to set up my AC97 audio (there's an Analog Devices
AD1885 on the board), I found that the vanilla 2.4.2 kernel has
an id match for an AD1885 with a line like
  {0x41445360, "Analog Devices AD1885"  , enable_eapd},
in drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c, but in the -ac patches (I've
tried -ac16 and -ac17) that id has been changed to 0x41445460
which causes the ac97_codec module to not recognize the hardware
for the -ac series.  Here's the snippet from patch-2.4.2-ac17 which 
(the diff is on drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c) shows the change:
-----8<-----------------------------------------------------
 220108  } ac97_codec_ids[] = {
 220109 -   {0x414B4D00, "Asahi Kasei AK4540 rev 0", NULL},
 220110 -   {0x414B4D01, "Asahi Kasei AK4540 rev 1", NULL},
 220111 -   {0x41445340, "Analog Devices AD1881"  , NULL},
 220112 -   {0x41445360, "Analog Devices AD1885"  , enable_eapd},
 .
 .
 .
 220124 +   {0x41445303, "Analog Devices AD1819",   NULL},
 220125 +   {0x41445340, "Analog Devices AD1881",   NULL},
 220126 +   {0x41445348, "Analog Devices AD1881A",  NULL},
 220127 +   {0x41445460, "Analog Devices AD1885",   enable_eapd},
-----8<-----------------------------------------------------
So, in 2.4.2-ac1[67], a line like
  kernel: ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x4144:0x5360 (Unknown)
shows up in '/var/log/messages', while with that ID in ac97_codec.c
changed back, I get this:
  kernel: ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x4144:0x5360 (Analog Devices AD1885)
and then sound works after loading i810_audio.
My question is, why did the ID change in ac97_codec.c?  Am I
supposed to add some sort of switch to modules.conf to tell it
what chip I've got?  Is it just a typo (the AD1881 ID didn't
change)?
Thanks,
-jesse
