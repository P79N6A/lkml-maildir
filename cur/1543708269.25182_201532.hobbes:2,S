This has solved the problem for me.  Please can anyone tell me what 
details are required to provide a bug report on this strange one off 
issue, as I wouldn't know where to start.
To recap:
rtl8139too cards worked on all kernels up until 2.6.3 (like 3 years).
The timeout issues started with 2.6.3 (using make oldconfig)... new 
settings applied.
Tried lilo 'append="noapic"  -> problem still persisted.
After reading I changed: 2.6.2 source-> 8139too.c to replace new 
2.6.3 source-> 8139too.c -> rebuilt with same .config.  No timeouts - 
all hunky dory.
Thanks,
Nick
