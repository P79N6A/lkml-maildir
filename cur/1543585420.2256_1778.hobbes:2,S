Hi, Tim
What is the default anyway?  My BIOS is 0x378, 7, 3 and the driver
reports this:
0x378: FIFO is 16 bytes
0x378: writeIntrThreshold is 8
0x378: readIntrThreshold is 8
0x378: PWord is 8 bits
0x378: Interrupts are ISA-Pulses
0x378: possible IRQ conflict!       [Don't know why it always reports
this]
0x378: ECP port cfgA=0x10 cfgB=0x00
0x378: ECP settings irq=<none or set by other means> dma=<none or set by
other means>
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778), irq 7, using FIFO
[PCSPP,TRISTATE,COMPAT,ECP]
parport0: cpp_daisy: aa5500ff(98)
parport0: assign_addrs: aa5500ff(98)
parport0: cpp_daisy: aa5500ff(98)
parport0: assign_addrs: aa5500ff(98)
With no options in modules.conf, lp0 uses polling; with irq=auto
dma=auto
it uses interrupt-driven but no dma?.
