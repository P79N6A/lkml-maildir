I don't _think_ it's changed, but I'll double-check that in a few days 
(I'm out of town).  I'll also rediff my patch.  Should it be a config 
option?
Anyway, I have no strong objection to seeing a change in 2.6 -- there's 
just some risk that it could break something that depends on the current 
(broken, undocumented) behavior.
Andrew:  would you be willing to put a capabilities fix into -mm?
