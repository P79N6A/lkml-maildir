I disagree.
For example, I can't find the appropriate product/component combinations for
some bugs that I put in there while registering recent regressions.  Also, for
some product/component combinations the notifications sent by the Bugzilla
actually go to nowhere.
[Speaking of which, what should I do to make all of the bugs in the
"Power management"->Hibernation/Suspend category go to
linux-pm@lists.linux-foundation.org ?]
I'm not saying that the Bugzilla isn't useful (otherwise I wouldn't have used
it), but IMO there are some problems with it.
Still, as you said, this isn't the real problem we have with handling bugs.

The only realistic way in which we can *try* to improve things is by increasing
the pressure on developers who don't fix bugs timely, although they could.
To this end, we could, for example, periodically publish per-subsystem
statistics of reported / handled / resolved bugs .  That also would give us an
idea of which subsystems are not sufficiently supported.
However, for this purpose we need to make sure that bug reports actually have
a chance to be read by the appropriate people and we need some tools to monitor
their activity without disturbing them too much (like some kind of passive
tracking).  I also realize that some people won't use the Bugzilla and there's
no way to make them use it, so I'm trying to suggest some general albeit well
defined rules for handling kernel bugs that can be followed by everyone
regardless of whether or not he's using the Bugzilla.
Apart from this, I think that some kinds of bugs are fixed faster if they are
reported by email and in many cases email is just a more convenient way of
exchainging information between bug reporters and developers, so I don't think
that ruling it out as a way of reporting bugs, just becuase we have the
Bugzilla, would be the best idea.
The Bugzilla is useful to me and I think it might be useful to many people, but
that doesn't necessarily mean that it'll be useful to everyone in any case.

Are you sure that this one hasn't been fixed?  The reporter doesn't seem to be
responsive ...

Same here.
