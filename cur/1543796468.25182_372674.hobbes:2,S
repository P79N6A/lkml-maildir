You should do what you think is best. One of the driver maintainers tasks 
is to look at the changes and ask questions if there is something 
suspicious. I asked and you pointed out that this time my concern was not 
valid.
During this discussion you have mentioned good arguments favouring both 
choices. Peformancewise we are talking about a rather theoretical issue: 
in a production server this issue might be relevant a few times a year.
My current suggestion is to use the value 1 (to minimise the possibility 
of bugs due to future changes). If you want, you can add a comment saying 
that using 1 is not strictly necessary with the current design.

It might be best to use naming that does not bind the purpose of the 
parameter to any "abstract" (i.e., read or write) activity when the 
purpose is to tell the function that the buffer contents may have been 
altered.
