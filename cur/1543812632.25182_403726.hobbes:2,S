You should be aware that bugzilla is not universally popular.  I
hardly ever look at it myself and perfer to deal with issues simply in
the mailing list.

Thanks for that confirmation.  It is always best to be sure.

The functions in /etc/init.d are very dependant on distribution.  I
gather you are using RedHat, and I know nothing about redhat's init.d.
However I suspect a badly configured firewall could be an issue and
disabling the firewall before trying again would be a good idea.

Don't worry about that.  Twice is much better than never.  It is very
easy to ignore a second copy of a bug report (when you read
linux-kernel you have to get good at ignoring things:-)
