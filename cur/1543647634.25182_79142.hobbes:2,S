Ole,
I don't think that exporting putpmsg and getpmsg as _GPL will
stop proprietary modules from being linked with LiS.  LiS exports
its symbols on a different basis.  There is no need for a proprietary
module using LiS to access putpmsg or getpmsg or the syscall
registration facility for that matter.  Is you concern that LiS
using a _GPL only facility will force GPL on modules linked with LiS
even though LiS is LGPL?
