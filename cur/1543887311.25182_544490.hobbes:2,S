Why does led_cdev->trigger need to be set to do this? Any well written
LED drivers shouldn't need to look at it as the LED drivers shouldn't
have or need any knowledge about specific triggers. If they need this,
you hw blinking abstraction isn't generic.
I had reservations about the hw blinking support last time we discussed
it but I can't remember the specifics of that discussion now without
looking it up. I'm going to hold this patch until we're about the merge
something that needs it, if it really needs it.

I can't see why you'd need to do this...

2. Encourages bad code ;-).
