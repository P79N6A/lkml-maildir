Having a similar problem here with 2.6.5-rc3-mm1, boot stops with:
Unable to load interpreter
No init found
passing pci=noacpi or init=/bin/bash makes not difference. The hard drive
light is off and the system still responds to keyboard events, but cannot
continue. This is on a Toshiba laptop, updating from a working 2.6.4-mm1.
Bios is updated to the latest version. I am also running reisers on the
root partition if that matters.
