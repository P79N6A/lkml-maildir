Just as an additional datapoint, I also get the "spurious 8259A interrupt: 
IRQ7" message on my laptop. I've been using 2.3.18+ for pcmcia support,
with a driver for my wireless pccard. On my previous laptop (A Toshiba
Satellite 200CDS) everything worked just fine, on my new laptop (a Toshiba
Satellite 230CX) I keep loosing interrupts. This causes havoc for my driver,
since it looks like it doesn't get the interrupt on time.
It MAY be the case that the card issues too many irq's to handle (I have
to poll to receive, with one irq on every packet), but I'm not quite sure
on that.

My current laptop is a Toshiba Satellite 230CX P133-MMX,
  Topic97 pcmcia/cardbus bridge (currently in tcic mode)

No help, but another data-point...
