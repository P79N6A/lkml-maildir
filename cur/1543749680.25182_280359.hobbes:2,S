Because /sys/block happened before /sys/class did.  Al Viro converted
the block layer before I got the struct class stuff working properly
during 2.5.
And yes, I would like to convert the block layer to use the class stuff,
but for right now, I can't as class devices don't allow
sub-classes-devices, and getting to that work is _way_ down on my list
of things to do.
thanks,
