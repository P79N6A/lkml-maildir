I get some strange e1000 failures too.  It usually involves the 
watchdog kicking them back into order, but sometimes they'll stay 
offline for a while.  Heat would explain it, though, because it only 
happens when I'm actually using the cards for a benchmark.  I figured 
that it was either my cables, or a shoddy switch.
The new dual-port e1000 that I have doesn't seem to have this problem, 
even though I'm running 4 times more traffic than the singles that I 
had.
