Unfortunately, life is not so simple.
X speaks RRBBGG -- or does it?  Suppose the user isn't running in
24-bit true-color mode; do I do my own dithering or quantization?  The
terminal emulators only know about the 16 EGA colors.  So, should I
support separate resource formats for X and menuconfig cases?  But
wait!  The Linux console does RRBBGG.
Other possibility: support only the 16 EGA colors by name.  But if I do that,
some of the X colors are just *wrong* on standard gray background (cyan is
a good example).
There's no way to get this right.  So I choose to get it wrong in a simple
way rather than a complex, costly way.
