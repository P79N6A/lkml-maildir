I think what should happen is either one of the followings.
1. Don't restore power state and re-enable PCI device on resume from 
freeze just as we don't do the opposite when freezing.
2. Unconditionally disable and power down PCI device on suspend whether 
it's freeze or not.
#2 would be simpler but I'm a bit worried about it.  There might be 
controllers which choke after such sequence (save state, disable, power 
down, no actual power removal, power on, restore state, re-enable).
#1 can be easily done by taking a look at the current device power state 
(gendev->power.power_state).  The problem is that no one in 
suspend/resume path seems to be setting that variable except for runtime 
suspend/resume stuff which is scheduled to be removed, right?  Pavel, is 
there any reason why suspend/resume paths don't set 
dev->power.power_state?  Is the field going away together with new 
libata?  Or am I just confused about it.
Thanks.
