Hello,
  The kernel 2.5.56 seems to have changed something that affected the XFS
code as I'm getting hit by one (and possibly two) bugs related to it now.
What happens is that the machine suddenly freezes (running Debian/Sid -
XFree 4.2.1, glibc 2.3.1, gnome2 - nothing out of ordinary) so that SysRq
keys don't have any effect (but Numlock still toggles the led on the
keyboard), machine is inaccessible from the net and the only cure is hard
reboot. Nothing gets logged on the freeze and on reboot when XFS attempts to
check the first filesystem the kernel oopses with Oops code 0002, in the
interrupt handler. Nothing gets logged, of course, so I can't provide the
full backtrace right now - I'll try to get it logged through the serial console
if it happens again with 2.5.58. I have copied some values by hand from the
screen (until I lost patience... :)):

The only way to get back to 2.5.5{6,7} is
to reboot to 2.5.55 or earlier whose XFS is able to recover the filesystem
and then go back to .5{6,7}. My machine config is attached. Is anyone else
observing such behavior?
TIA,
marek
