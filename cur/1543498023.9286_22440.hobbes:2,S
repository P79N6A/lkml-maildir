How many directories were in your patch directory?
I've made a long mkdir/rmdir/mv test (only directories)
(ca 70.000 operations), mostly in RAM (140 MB disk, 192 MB RAM)
with 2.3.5, egcs 1.1.2, IDE: no corruptions.
I'll try to repeat the test today with reduced memory.
Should I switch back to 2.3.4?

Have you saved the complete directory sectors?
Perhaps a manual inspection could explain what happened.
