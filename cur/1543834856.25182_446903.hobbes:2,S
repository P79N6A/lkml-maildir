Oh, for people using a distro, I'm sure it's no problem at all.  It's
the homebrew people I'm worried about ;-)

Actually, that's exactly why it's a big deal.  The kernel spits out
messages like:
                printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: Mode Sense: %02x %02x %02x %02x\n",
                       diskname, buffer[0], buffer[1], buffer[2], buffer[3]);
where diskname is something like sda.  Now the user has to figure out
what sda means in terms of /dev/disk/ and in terms of scsi h:c:t:l and
in terms of which sticky label is on which drive.  If we let userspace
change the gendev's disk_name, that printk can be meaningful to the user
in at least one of those senses.
