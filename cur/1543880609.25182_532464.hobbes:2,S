    Big fat truth, I'm afraid. The thing is that I thought that Linux
did that from time to time to update the count. Obviously, doing it for
every statfs call would be very expensive :((

    It doesn't, certainly, but Windows doesn't care. Moreover, the
device doesn't seem to recalculate the value on every run (unless it
does it lightning fast!), so maybe the number is stored elsewhere (the
count can be stored in many places as far as I've read, but I don't know
the details).
    A mount option to force walking the FAT and getting the real info
could be interesting. That way, it will be only done for certain devices
(small disks, for example).
    Thanks for your answer :)
