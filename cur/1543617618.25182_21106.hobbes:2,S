It appears the folks up in redmond have succeeded in having the BIOS
people default disable PCI resources.  Since XP will reject, or assume a
device is in use should the BAR's be allocated, the various archs may need
to have a broader setup table or a more generic ruleset.
Any thoughts on how best to address good hardare, which the BIOS does not
setup per redmond-rules.
