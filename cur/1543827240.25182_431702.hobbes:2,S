Unless specified differently at format time, the inodes-per-group will
be the same value (namely 16384) if the filesystem is larger than 512MB.
So, yes, I agree with you if you start with a tiny filesystem and try
to resize it to a gigantic filesystem you will get a different number
of inodes, but that is true whether this is online resizing or offline.
That said, for anyone who has resized their filesystem I think they prefer
to be able to resize it than not being able to do so at all.
Cheers, Andreas
