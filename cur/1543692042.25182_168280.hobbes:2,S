If you just kfree() there you don't need your own bur can simply use
video_device_release() ...

That's a v4l vs. v4l2 API thing.  The v4l2 API allows applications to
switch a device handle into vbi mode via S_FMT, thus you don't need
separate devices any more.  For v4l1 backward comparibility this is
still needed through.  For v4l2 drivers /dev/video and /dev/vbi almost
the same, /dev/vbi has just some other default settings after opening
the device.
