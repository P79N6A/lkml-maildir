Hello,
How much of memory can be allocated from a tasklet ? [ kmalloc 
(GFP_ATOMIC) ].
I was able to allocate upto 2.5 MB. But I would like to allocate upto 
8MB. Is this possible?
The physical RAM limit is 64 MB. I am running 2.4.7-10 RH 7.2 on i386.
Any suggestions or pointers could be very helpful.
Thank you.
Regards,
Sriram
