Hi everybody !
It my first post to this list, so please don't flame me too much :-)
Here's my problem :
i have a RedHat 5.2, with kernel 2.2.5, on my PC
i have a PCI NE2000-compatible network card, name is 'SN3200', on irq
10, port 0xe800
i compiled the kernel with PCI NE2000 support
when booting the kernel, i see lines 'NE2000, irq 10, port 0xE800', with
the brand 'RealTek' (i think that's it, i don't have the exact message
right here, but i'll find it if necessary), so i may assume the card is
correctly detected.
now, when i 'cat /proc/interrupts', i don't see a line for irq 10 !
i see irq 11 (my SCSI card), irq 7 (SoundBlaster), but nothing for my
network card !
of course, when i use the 'dhcpcd' client on eth0, it fails......
so my question is the following : is there a trouble somewhere ?
i supposedly have drivers for my card, but the sources are for an old
kernel (breaks the makefiles for new ones)
also, something strange : i accidentally booted with an old kernel (i
think is was 2.2.1), with support for ISA NE2000 (my old network card).
The kernel detected the ISA
card (with a warning saying that i should definitely use the PCI
support), and that time
'cat /proc/interrupts' showed a line for irq 10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
another question : is irq 10 cascaded somewhere (i mean, is it the same
as another irq) ?
TIA for ur answers :-)
