I had hoped to collect more data with CFS V2. It crashes in
scale_nice_down for s2ram when attempting to disable_nonboot_cpus. 
So part of traceback looks like (typed by hand with obvious omissions):
scale_nice_down
update_stats_wait_end - not shown in traceback because inlined
pick_next_task_fair
migration_call
task_rq_lock
notifier_call_chain
_cpu_down
disable_nonboot_cpus
...
This is standard -rc7 with V2 CFS applied. It could be a completely
unrelated issue. I'll attempt to debug further tomorrow.
