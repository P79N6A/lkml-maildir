i've uploaded .26-1 which has special BKL-debugging code added, which
will (hopefully) pinpoint where the BKL count leaked. (Karsten had
similar problems, with NFS.)
so, could you try .26-1 from the usual place:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
and make sure you still have CONFIG_RT_DEADLOCK_DETECT enabled. When
this warning message hits next time around it should print some more
info about the place that last acquired the BKL.
