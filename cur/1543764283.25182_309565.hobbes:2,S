Hmm, what exactly do you think _must_ be changed?
Most of your comments are addressed in 4 patches I sent to you and Greg.
Others [mostly atomic allocation] are API extensions and will be added.
There also not included flush on callback removal.

SuperIO and kobject_uevent are also dropped as far as I can see.
Acrypto is being reviewed but it also depends on it, although 
it takes to much time, probably will be dropped too.
Proper w1 notification also requires connector.
