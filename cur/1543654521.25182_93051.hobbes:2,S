Thanks for catching this Christoph I thought the only use was inside
SCSI. I could make a patch to scsi-misc to add tag back in. Another
option if it is still needed is to switch to "->name == "generic").
Though I have not used this interface I thought if one was using an sg
device to a ide-scsi device and the flag was set that sg commands that
where not 100% the same as ATAP commands where translated.
