Only because of the distribution of the windows driver. As I understand US and 
International copyright law, dynamic linking cannot create a new, derivative 
work and hence cannot carry its own license. (It's a "machine translation") 
What that means is that there is no violation of the GPL if GPL'd code is 
linked to proprietary code and then distributed. However, the GPLv3 does have 
language in it that would require the proprietary code to also be 
distributed.
