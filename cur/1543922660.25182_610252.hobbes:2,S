Here is an original patch I proposed (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/18/292
)
------------------------------------------------------
Subject: serial: do not call ->pm() on initialization for console port
From: Atsushi Nemoto <anemo@mba.ocn.ne.jp>
If the port was already enabled as a serial console, there is no need
to call pm callback to power it up.  This patch fixes serial console
initialization on serial_txx9 driver.

OK, then I'd like to propose this alternative
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/18/301
).  This should be work regardless
of the patch above.

Subject: serial: Fix serial_txx9 console initialization
From: Atsushi Nemoto <anemo@mba.ocn.ne.jp>
Now serial_core calls ->pm() on initialization even if the port was
used for console.  This behaviour breaks serial_txx9 console since The
serial_txx9 driver initialize its port entirely on its ->pm() method
if new state was 0.  This patch adds checking for oldstate value to
fix this probelm.
