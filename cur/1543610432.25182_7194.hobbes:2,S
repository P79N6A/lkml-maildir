        does hdparm -u1 fixes the problem?
       -u1 == unmasq irq during its handling
    the problem is that serial port need its interrupt to be served with minimal
   latency, and the drives makes that impossible, unless irqs are unmasked...
   looks like ( = - disc io irq handling periods, . - the ones of serial port):
    both ones wants something like:
   disc:   =========  =============  ================== ============= =========
   serial: .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  in reality:  ==============.=============. ============= ===========
   etc etc...
cheers, Samium Gromoff
