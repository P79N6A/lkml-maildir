Thanks for this information.
That's the one that fixes the breakage introduced in 2.6.16.17...
Looking at Alan's patch in -mm, it seems the best current solution for 
2.6.16 is to go back to the pre-2.6.16.17
  DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_ANY_ID, quirk_via_irq);
and revisit this after Alan's patch was released with 2.6.20?
