I think CNAMEs are all that we need now.  BitMover and Penguin Computing
will host it for the time being and if we cross over to the dark side
someone else can step forward and host it and all you need to do is redo
the CNAMEs.  
We do need to advertise the "URLs" for the CVS tree and the SVN tree and 
the BK trees as well I suppose.  Is that a Gooch/FAQ thing?  Richard, you
still out there?
