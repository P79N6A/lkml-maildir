Thanks for the quick answer.
We've already tried so. From tens of miliseconds to 10 seconds (!), without
success.
We should have mentioned it in our previous mail :(
BTW, the hardware is ok. We tested it in Win95, where it took 8 seconds
to get the syncronism and display correct images, but it worked. From
that the 10 seconds delay we introduced at the begining of the detection
process. But it didn't work either.
We've seen reports from people which seem to be using c-qcam with vic, but 
none of them said what kernel version they were using. We have 2.2.10, but 
c-qcam does not seem to have changed in the near past.
Are there technical specifications somewhere which might help?
Thanks again,
Elena & Juan-Mariano.
