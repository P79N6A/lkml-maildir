If unmodified, yes.  Because if they were not modified, they
would be exact to the orignial which was otherwise licensed, and
as such one could get the original anyways, so it makes no
difference.  However, if I take BSD sources, and modify them, and
I don't mean adding a function here and there, I mean modifying
each existing bit of code, moving things around, etc... and GPL
it, only the ORIGINAL code is BSD licensed.  My modifications are
GPL, and the work as a whole is too.  To use the modified whole,
in full or in part is in violation of the GPL, unless the "part"
used coincidentally has NONE of my modifications in it.
