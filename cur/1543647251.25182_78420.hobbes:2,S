The problem is that the config syntax will continue to evolve and
currently I prefer to keep the library close to the matching config
files.
I think I can keep the basic structure constant, but new options will be
added, so IMO it's more likely that a front end works with a newer
library than that a library can understand a newer syntax.
bye, Roman
