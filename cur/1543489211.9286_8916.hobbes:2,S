Sorry, I wasn't clear in what I said.  You said there was no technical
reason for any endian-ness - it was arbitrary.  So I took that to mean that
you would not agree that running X-endian on a machine with X-endian
devices was a good technical reason.
}No, I'm arguing AGAINST using BE.
Compromise.  8-bit computing.
}The computing world would be better off with just one byte order, that
}byte order isn't going to be BE.
