I don't remember the technical details, but Denys Vlasenko posted some 
patches that implemented -ffunction-sections while retaining exports.
Another approach would be calling gcc with "-combine -fwhole-program".
David Woodhouse once sent a whacky patch that implemented this on a 
per-module basis retaining exports.
Much harder, but with the biggest possible savings, would be a 
CONFIG_MODULES=n kernel built with one gcc call.

You forget the big embedded userbase - some even stay at kernel 2.4 
since kernel 2.6 is much bigger.
