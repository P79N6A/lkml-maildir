Hi!
On Aug-4-1999 I posted two patches to linux-kernel ML.
They arrived, since they appear on the ML archive at www.tux.org. 
( the URLs of my messages are :
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/1999week32/0452.html
 and
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/1999week32/0451.html
 )
One patch if for selecting the root file-system by its UUID or volume label,
the other is to show more information in the file /proc/partitions , 
with my patch it also shows the length of partitions.
The subject lines of the messages are :
[PATCH] Select root-fs by UUID or label
and
[PATCH] /proc/partitions show startings sectors
Now the problem is that I received not a single comment on them,
neither on my e-mail , nor on the LKML ( I'm not subscribed, I read
the archive at www.tux.org ).
Can I at least have a "Your patches suck , go away !" ?
