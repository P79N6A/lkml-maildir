Hi All.
Hope this is not too much off-topic.  I have a client who wants to setup a
high-availability linux server network.  It's an ISP, so we're talking
mail/web/ftp/dns/etc.  I would like to have 2 identical boxes, with
identical harddisks partitioned the same way, and to have the main box
constantly synchronize it's filesystem with the standby box, so that when
it fails, the standby just does an IP takeover, and has all the recent data 
in place.  I would really like to do this on the lowest possible level,
something like 'write this block to head x, cylinder y', instead of doing
cp over nfs every 5 minutes or so.  Is there anything available that would
do something like that?  If not, how easy would adding this to the kernel
be?  Can it be done it all?  My idea was to have the standby box run a
custom init binary, that would just sync the disks and wait for the other
box to die.  When it dies, it runs the real init, everything comes up, and
the box takes over.
Thanks in advance.
