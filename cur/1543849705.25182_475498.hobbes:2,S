MMIO of course is completely different.  For regular memory accesses I 
think we should never allow a load on the left side of "=>" or "==>".  
Keep them invisible!  :-)
Writing ld(A) => st(A) is bad because (1) it suggests that the store
somehow "sees" the load (which it doesn't; the load is invisible), and (2)  
it suggests that the store occurs "later" in some sense than the load
(which might not be true, since a load doesn't necessarily return the
value of the temporally most recent store).
My viewpoint is that "=>" really provides an ordering of stores only.  
Its use with loads is something of an artifact; it gives a convenient way
of expressing the fact that a load "sees" an initial segment of all the
stores to a variable (and the value it returns is that of the last store
in the segment).

How about this instead: "A==>B" means that B sees the value stored by A,
and "A==B" means that A and B are both loads and they see the value from
the same store.  That way we avoid putting a load on the left side of
"==>".

You are right.
