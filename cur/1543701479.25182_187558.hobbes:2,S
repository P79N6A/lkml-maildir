with 2.4.23 it does not work either.
dmesg says:
atyfb: using auxiliary register aperture
atyfb: Mach64 BIOS is located at c0000, mapped at c00c0000.
atyfb: BIOS contains driver information table.
atyfb: colour active matrix monitor detected: CPT CLAA141XB01        
        id=10, 1024x768 pixels, 262144 colours (LT mode)
        supports 60 Hz refresh rates, default 60 Hz
        LCD CRTC parameters: 15384 167 127 130 0 17 805 767 769 6
atyfb: 3D RAGE Mobility (PCI) [0x4c4d rev 0x64] 8M SDRAM, 29.498928 MHz XTAL,
       230 MHz PLL, 83 Mhz MCLK, 125 Mhz XCLK
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 80x25
fb0: ATY Mach64 frame buffer device on PCI
                        
When booting the screen gets slowly flooded with white. 
X11 works anyway.
dmesg's output shows different MCLK and XCLK with kernel 2.4.23 
(see above).
