Maybe if you looked at the source, you'd have a better idea:
	if (newsize < 208)
		newsize = 208;
So, newsize will always be greater than 208, and therefore greater
than 128.  Also:
	if (newsize > 4096)
		newsize = 4096;
So it can't be larger than 4096.  Then we do this:
	for (new2size = 128; new2size < newsize; new2size <<= 1)
		;
to find a value of new2size which is a power of two.
	if (new2size - newsize > newsize - (new2size >> 1))
		new2size >>= 1;
ie, find the power of two value of new2size which is numerically
closest to newsize.  There probably is a better algorithm for
finding this.

You're welcome to provide a solution.  Take into account that shifts
take either 1 (or 0 cycles when combined with another instruction) on
ARM, and modulus is fairly expensive, and this driver is solely for
use on ARM.
Also note that this is an OSS driver for oldish hardware, and the
above has been working fine since 2.2 days.
To be honest, I don't remember too many of the requirements of this
driver at present, (ie, why 208) so since it's known to be working,
I'd suggest leaving it be (adding a comment / reformatting that bit
of code to look less suspicious of course is acceptable.)
