Only if we fix the underlying problem --- I was only pointing out that
even if we drop the setting of s_dirt entirely, which was what we were
trying to fix, we can't avoid having to find the sb.

Yep, but there are probably other places we can find where we can avoid
passing the sb around too if we have the back-pointer. I guess it makes
sense to go ahead with that.
