On return_to_userspace, you /know/ the thread has
released the kernel locks.
Though this might not work for IPC semaphores...
Then again, if the Montavista people (maybe together with
SGI or IBM folks?) can get a light-weight priority inversion
scheme working, then we'll have everything right ;)

SCHED_OTHER is enough for most purposes. OTOH, you
could have one SCHED_FIFO process block execution
of a higher priority SCHED_FIFO process that wants
a lock ... priority inversion anyway?
