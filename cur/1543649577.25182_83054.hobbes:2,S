Yeah, another AOL "Me Too" here - I'm an embedded linux developer and
think would be useful.  Being able to network boot the device, download
software to a flash, and then directly "kexec" boot from the kernel on
the flash would be nice. 
Anything that reduces dependencies on the BIOS is good.  I'd use this
feature if it was available.
