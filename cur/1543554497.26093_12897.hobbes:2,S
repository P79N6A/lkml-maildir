It's the socket drivers which _aren't_ in the kernel source which are most
likely to exhibit this problem. Anything in the kernel tree was probably
converted by Linus, and hence done right. As there are so few socket drivers
in his tree, the amount of code duplication wasn't immediately obvious
either.
The offenders are the multitude of PCMCIA and CF socket drivers for 
embedded boards which are floating around. They aren't likely to get merged 
into 2.4, unfortunately - but I think we should at least make this 
available in order for them to work correctly.
