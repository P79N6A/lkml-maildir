It looks like the 2 first screenshots show buggy data:
First:
CPU0:   0,1% user   0,1% system   0,0% nice  99,18% iowait   0,103% idle
CPU1:   0,0% user   0,4% system   0,0% nice  99,18% iowait   0,101% idle
Second:
CPU0:   0,15% user   0,4% system   0,0% nice   4,1070639% iowait   0,434% idle
CPU1:   0,13% user   0,7% system   0,0% nice   4,1070639% iowait   0,433% idle
Third:
CPU0:   3,1% user   2,3% system   0,0% nice   0,0% iowait  94,0% idle
CPU1:   3,3% user   2,0% system   0,0% nice   0,0% iowait  94,1% idle
Always the same, does not depend on interval. Samples above were taken with
top -d100.
Hope this helps.
