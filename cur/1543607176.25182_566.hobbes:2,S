Hi,
I remember a discussion about net_dev->flags and carrier loss etc
detection. Did the things change? I mean, do we currently have a way
for network device driver to report (to the rest of kernel, to the
userland) that the link is down? It would include DCD (carrier) loss,
Ethernet link down, IrDA/USB disconnects etc.
I think the kernel should deactivate respective routing table entries
as well when a link goes down.
