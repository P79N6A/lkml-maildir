Hi,
To follow up on a recent thread on the arm-linux mailing list, I would 
like to have your your feedback about SDIO wifi cards you are using with 
the brand new SDIO stack.
I look at the page on the MMC wiki :
http://mmc.drzeus.cx/wiki/SDIO
but cannot see a card using the Marvell 8xxx chipset : Can you give me
advice on which SDIO cards/module you are using.
Another point, do you know what the plans are for future SDIO wifi chips
support ?
The Marvell chip seems a bit particular as a wifi chip (802.11 stack
included in chip). Do you think that other chips are more or less
difficult to interface through SDIO ?
Is an Atheros-based card support planned ? (maybe more a madwifi people
question...)
Thanks for your help.
