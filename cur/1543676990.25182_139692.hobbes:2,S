I tried putting this on my Fujitsu Lifebook P2120 (Crusoe based), and it
freezes the system hard when using hwclock to sync the system clock with the
hardware clock.
Running hwclock under strace in the init script prints out it opening
/dev/rtc (for the second time), and then sometimes dying in the middle
of printing out the following ioctl: "ioctl(3, RTC_UIE_ON, 0)", and more
often in printing out the following read().
Removing the rtc module lets the system boot up.
2.4.21-rc7 works fine.  The config file I'm using can be found at
    
http://lorien.emufarm.org/~duvall/.config
What bits should I start hacking away to narrow down the problem, or is
this known?
Thanks,
Danek
