To find out where to report problems on a specific device, look in the
MAINTAINERS file. I developed and maintain that driver. 
Also, the mailing list for network drivers is netdev@vger.kernel.org
There is a receive problem that shows up under load, that is fixed
in the latest version (2.6.18 git), the patch is queued for the stable
tree as well.
