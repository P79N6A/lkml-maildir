Hello,
I always thought that find_first_zero_bit() is for arbitrary length
bitmaps and ffz() is for 32bit length bitmaps (words).
But it seems that find_first_zero_bit() doesn't work for >32 bit. Is it
supposed to?
I declare my bitmap as char *inode_map=kmalloc(128,GFP_KERNEL) and use
test_bit()/set_bit()/find_first_zero_bit() to manipulate it and it works
fine up until bit=31 (0-31) but not higher.
Any responses welcome,
Tigran.
