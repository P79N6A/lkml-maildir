Hi,
I wrote a process that spawns a thread and then the thread just goes to 
town using CPU (on purpose) while the main process waits on it. 
On linux-2.6.3 and top 3.1.15 top shows that the machine is 0% idle, but 
it does not show any processes taking any significant CPU time. 
However, things show fine on linux-2.6.11 with top 3.2.5
Does anyone know if this was a top deficiency or something the kernel 
wasn't reporting correctly?
Thanks,
  Davy
