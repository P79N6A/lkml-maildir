My worry is that such special cases might be needed in more places as we
discover further or as code evolves. Fundamentally looks like the locked and 
unlocked paths of the kernel cannot be separated so well because of interaction 
between subsystems. /me thinks rwsem seems to be a sane thing to go after.
