I found a problem, but it would mean that it was already broken before my
patch.
X does this test to check if a chip has 24 bit or a 32 bit precision display
fifo settings:
    if (pATI->Chip < ATI_CHIP_264VT4)
    {
        pATI->XCLKPageFaultDelay += 2;
        pATI->XCLKMaxRASDelay += 3;
        pATI->DisplayFIFODepth = 24;
    }
In atichip.h, ATI_CHIP_264LT is smaller than ATI_CHIP_264VT4, so according
to the X sources, the Mach64 LT has a fifo depth 24.
Now my code:
    if (M64_HAS(FIFO_24)) {
        info->fifo_size = 24;
        info->xclkpagefaultdelay += 2;
        info->xclkmaxrasdelay += 3;
    } else {
        info->fifo_size = 32;
    };
That looks ok. But look at the aty_chips table:
    { 0x4c47, 0x4c47, 0x00, 0x00, m64n_ltg,     230,  63,  63, M64F_GT |
    M64F_INTEGRATED | M64F_GTB_DSP | M64F_SDRAM_MAGIC_PLL |
    M64F_EXTRA_BRIGHT | M64F_LT_SLEEP | M64F_G3_PB_1024x768 },
The Mach64 LT does not have the M64F_FIFO_24 flag set! That will result in
completely different values to be calculated and cause a distorted
display.
