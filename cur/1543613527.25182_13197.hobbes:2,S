It's not just mandrake, it's all linux and in
fact that's where the named data wants to
live -
Not only dns info, but things like mail spool,
system logs, cron files -
And it's not just linux, it's pretty much a unix
thing in general -
Are you really sure you want to blow away
everyone's mail, all your dns records, cron
jobs etc if the system powers down?
