I don't really have a test application. It's my shell scripts for
synchronising my window manager and X client. The reader is cat and
the writer is tcsh/echo.
No-one should be doing O_NONBLOCK. I don't really know which is
starting first. Earlier in 2.3.4x I had some testcode which sometimes
demonstrated the same problem, but that testcode hasn't failed yet
with 2.3.48.
Not once have I seen the problem with 2.2.14.
