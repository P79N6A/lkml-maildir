The actual TODO is a bit larger :)
4. make container lists per-zone
5. make per-container scanner reclaim not-shared pages first
6. teach controller to account for shared-pages
7. start reclamation when the limit is lowered
8. (?) start reclamation in the background when the limit is 
   not yet hit but the usage is getting closer
