vs and zam, please comment on what we get from our profiler and spinlock
debugger that the standard tools don't supply.  I am sure you have a

We would like to keep the disabled code in there until we have a chance
to prove (or fail to prove) that cycle detection can be resolved
effectively, and then with a solution in hand argue its merits.
