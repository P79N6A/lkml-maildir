The issue was not libata/sata_sil but rather pci device detection on this
box - note the second card was absent from the original lspci output. After
moving the cards to the secondary (64/33) bus everything popped up fine.
Haven't tried the tertiary bus slots.
Interestingly the machine would not boot up at all with the cards in certain
combinations of slots on the primary bus - probably irratated something in
the proprietary Compaq BIOS.
