Another C file in the Documentation directory.  Sigh.  At kernel summit I
suggested that we should be putting these things in a place from where we
can actually build and install them.  People said there was no need to do
that because kernel developers can now easily get new stuff into
util-linux.  I don't believe them.  Wanna be a guinea pig?

newline here.  Just because it's userspace doesn't mean that it needs to
look crappy, despite all the code out there which disproves this ;)
I think you just invented pread().

It's odd to use kerneldoc-style markup in a non-kerneldoc comment.

Are the get_task_struct/put_task_struct here actually needed?
