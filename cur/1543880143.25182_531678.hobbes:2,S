No - the real fix is to change the applications or to run under a policy
that confines all applications. Most of the problems with resolv.conf,
mtab, etc. stem from admin processes (e.g., editors or shell scripts)
all running under the same unconfined domain.
In some cases applications need modification as only the application has
enough information to determine the correct label. Usually this means
preserving labels from input files or separating the output into
distinct directories so type transitions or label inheritance will work.
restorecond is just a hack not a requirement or a sign that something is
wrong with the model. That is why it is a userspace application and not
integrated into the kernel mechanism.
