   Dave, why do you even bother with usbkbd? It MUST DIE and get
   removed. Please, do me a favour: kill CONFIG_USB_KBD from your
   configuration and let me and Vojtech know if something
   actually fails. The hid must support all devices which were
   supported bye usbkbd.
Peter, first relax. :-)
Second, I was merely fixing a build error reported by a user.
I personally use USB HID, but as long as USBKBD sits in the tree, it
should at least build.
