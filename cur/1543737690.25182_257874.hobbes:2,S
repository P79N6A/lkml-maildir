ah ok.

I understand raw_pci_ops is not ACPI specific.
But pci_root_ops is only used by pci_acpi_scan_root().
grundler@gsyprf3:/usr/src/linux-2.6.8.1$ fgrep pci_acpi_scan_root include/*/*
include/acpi/acpi_drivers.h:struct pci_bus *pci_acpi_scan_root(struct acpi_device *device, int domain, int bus);
and
./drivers/acpi/pci_root.c:      root->bus = pci_acpi_scan_root(device, root->id.segment, root->id.bus);
The rename still seems appropriate to me.
thanks,
