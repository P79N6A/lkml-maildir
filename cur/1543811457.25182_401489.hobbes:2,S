Good catch.

The architecture seems to disagree somewhat :) (and I also got a
different response code on the non-MSS capable HW I tested on). On
further looking at the code, the check leaves room for improvement
anyway... I'd prefer the following patch:
s390: Improve response code handling in chsc_enable_facility().
Rather than checking for some known failures, check positively for the
success response code 0x0001 and return -EIO for unrecognized failure
response codes.
