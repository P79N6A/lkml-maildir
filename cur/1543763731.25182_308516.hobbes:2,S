Wouldn't getting rescheduled (and thus having another program trash the
cache on you) really mess up the data collection though? I suppose by
spawning off threads, each with a fixed affinity and SCHED_FIFO one could
hang onto the CPU to collect the data. But then it's not (a lot) different
than doing it in-kernel.

This part seems sensible though :-)
