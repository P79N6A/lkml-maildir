On one machine (with a bad power supply, as it turned out) it took
memtest86 almost 18 hours to report an error. So 12 hours isn't enough
either.
(On a related note, one machine that I tested with mprime's Torture Test
<

 took I think close to 43 hours to show a
failure. In that case I don't know if the failure was the CPU or the
motherboard, because in the end both failed on that system.)
