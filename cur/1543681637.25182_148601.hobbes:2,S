No you don't :-)
If you miss, you do a bypass to main memory.  Then when the
app asks for the data (if it even does at all, consider that)
it get's a clean copy in it's L2 cache.
Overall it's more efficient this way.

Absolutely correct.  We can't use the cache bypass-on-miss stores on
sparc64 unless the copy is at least a couple of cachelines in size.
It all works out, don't worry :-)
