OK, then how are they allocated?  Are they only allocated by your
special drivers or in your architecture?
I think allowing this is weird:
        foo = special_zen_malloc();
        bar = kmalloc();
        kfree(foo);
        kfree(bar);
Shoudn't it be
	special_zen_free(free);?
BTW, your arch-specific definition of PG_foreign is a little goofy.  If
you need the bit, then put it in page-flags.h now.  The memory hotplug
people have an evil plan to consume all unused bits in page->flags
(determined at compile-time) and that little gem will certainly break
it.  
It's great that you contained stuff to your architecture, but little
bits like the page-flags thing don't make me think you've done it for
real, only hacked around it :)
