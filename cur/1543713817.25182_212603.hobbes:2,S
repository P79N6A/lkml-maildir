ext3 doesn't support O_DIRECT in 2.4 kernels.  I did a patch once and I
think it's in 2.4-aa kernels.
ext3 supports O_DIRECT in 2.6 kernels.  Quite a number of filesystems do.

Yup that's a bit silly.  In 2.6 we do the check at open() and fcntl() time.
In 2.4 we don't fail until the actual I/O attempt.

We have been insufficiently assiduous in merging externally-supported
patches into the mainline 2.4 tree.

Looks nice and simple.  You'll need an ext2 filesystem to test it under 2.4.
Be aware that it's rather a challenge to actually get the O_DIRECT #define
in scope under some glibc versions.  I think you need to define _GNU_SOURCE
or something like that.
