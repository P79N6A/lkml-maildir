Unfortunately yes they do. We now have the notifier chains, which
can be used. Firmware, especially if it is large, must be requested
while the system is still fully functional and paging will work.
Asynchronocity will not help much because the devices must work
after resumingand delaying that will not help with respect to needing
devices to get at the firmware.
