* Automatic parsing of things like .config files and oopsen.
* Version tracking that is more suited to a codebase that has at least
  5 very active trees.
* Fully controlable by E-Mail, not only web.
Those are the ones I'm most interested in initially.  Other things can
follow.
I'd had a lot of comments saying that it would be better to either add
these ideas to Bugzilla, or to write a generic bug database, and not
make it specific to kernel development.
The reasons I'm _not_ doing either of those is mostly:
* I don't like Bugzilla at all
* It's easy to make a kernel-specific bug database generic, and not so
  easy to make a generic database kernel-specific
Incidently, can your TV set top box browse the web, or just send
E-Mail?  It would be quite cool if you could go through the bug
database using it :-)
John.
