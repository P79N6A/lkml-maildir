What do these messages mean?  That something is terribly hosed?
swap_dup: Bad swap file entry 1842b040
VM: killing process cc1
swap_free: Bad swap file entry 1dab3064
swap_free: Bad swap file entry 1842b040
swap_free: Bad swap file entry 18429040
swap_free: Bad swap file entry 31d7303c
swap_free: Bad swap offset entry 31d71000
(This is from a UP 2.4.18 kernel with XFS 1.1 patches.)
Is this caused by a hardware defect (broken IDE interface, maybe; in
our case VIA vt8233)?
