I looked at your config and see that you include isdn direct in kernel and
HiSax as module. Please try isdn as module too.
If the kernel boots then, it is clear that the problem is located anywhere
in isdn.o. If the module loads OK, it will be a sign that it have to do with
the init code of isdn, but I tested direct isdn kernel with the 2.3.15 code
(but allways isdn + hisax in kernel not mix module/kernel).
