Wait, you can have hardware with both EHCI and UHCI too.  Does that mean
we should merge all three together?  I don't think so :)
But perhaps we can order the hardware init stuff from all three together
like this into a separate module they all depend on.  In a way, that's
what the lock tried to do, right?  Are we just not catching all places
we could have hardware being talked to by two modules at the same time?
thanks,
