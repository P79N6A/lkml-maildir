I'm with you on that....i put it on one machine and threw away the
redhat rpm to find that i needed it a week later for another machine and
redhat had released their 2.4.18. So had to make it by hand for a
change. 2.4.17 does well at everything while not giving oopses.
also alan's 2.4.13 was really good too.
