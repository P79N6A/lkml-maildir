OK.  In your second oops trace the `swapper' process had used 5k of its
8k kernel stack processing an XFS IO completion interrupt.  And I don't
think `swapper' uses much stack of its own.
If some other process happens to be using 3k of stack when the same 
interrupt hits it, it's game over.
So at a guess, I'd say you're being hit by excessive stack use in
the XFS filesystem.  I think the XFS team have done some work on that
recently so an upgrade may help.
Or it may be something completely different ;)
