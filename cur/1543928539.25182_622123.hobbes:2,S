Exactly.
It is still interesting to test to see what happens if you plugin the
normal values into ioapic_i8259 for .pin and .apic (.pin is 0 or 2 and .apic is 0)
and see what happens.
Having a command line parameter that could do that would be a cheap temporary
solution.
But this is the most likely reason why the timer interrupt is not working.
