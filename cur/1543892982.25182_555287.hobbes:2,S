I've read the archive. I'm totally unconvinced by any of the fd
allocation policy stuff. There are some good arguments about O_CLOEXEC
and threading but not about fd allocation.

Are you being deliberately stupid ?
I suggested *libc* contains a default allocator

Currently the fd ranges are assigned by a committee called POSIX based on
Unix practice.

This is true, but if you are worried about complexity we get back to the
original posix allocator which packs them in tight and produces a most
excellent spread in the general case (whacko apps like bash aside)
