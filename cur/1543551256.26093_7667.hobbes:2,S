  I saw this the other week on our two-way Dell under a reasonibly heavy
load - but with 3c59x.c driver, the eepro100s survived!
  Either NIC (had two Tornados) could go this away after anything from 1
to 36 hours of load.  They would end up running in "poll" mode off the
transmit watchdog timer.
  Swapped them for a dual-port eepro100 and no more problems.
