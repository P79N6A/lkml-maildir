Yes.  Still no idea why that happens through ...

Bug reproducable with this one turned off?

page_cache_release()
> EIP is at videobuf_dma_free+0xa9/0xc0 [video_buf]
The code calling page_cache_release looks like this ...
	if (dma->pages) {
		int i;
		for (i=0; i < dma->nr_pages; i++)
			page_cache_release(dma->pages[i]);
		kfree(dma->pages);
		dma->pages = NULL;
	}
... even with videobuf_dma_free() called twice by mistake that shouldn't
double-free the pages.  Maybe videobuf_dma_free() is called from two
places at the same time because one of the call paths misses a lock, but
I can't find any on a quick review.  Hmm.
Does transcode use threads?  If so, does it call into bttv from
different threads?

must be VIDIOCSYNC ioctl.
