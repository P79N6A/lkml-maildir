Jeff, give it a rest.
Oracle and IBM haven't been complaining, have they? Oracle mostly does 
user-space stuff (that doesn't change), and has been pretty good about 
their Oracle-fs too - they're even actively discussing "git" issues on the 
git mailing list, and asking for help, and just generally being good 
members of the community.
And IBM engineers are part of the people who change internal kernel 
interfaces in order to make it work better for them.
Pretty much the ONLY people who ever complain about those internal kernel 
interfaces changing are the free-loaders. It's hard for them, because they 
don't want to play according to the rules. Tough. Watch me not care:
