No actually the way it works on modern x86 CPUs is that the best
strategy for saving power is to do things quickly and then
idle longer. That means on anything that has reasonably
deep sleep modi e.g. on older server/desktop systems things might
be slightly different because they had very little power saving
features enabled, but it's definitely true for all
laptop systems from the last several years. But even
on desktop/server throttling tends to be a bad idea.
Intel style throttling makes the CPU skip cycles so the maximum built
up heat for a time unit is less, but it will run active for longer that 
makes it overall take more power for a given work unit.
Here's a better description from Dominik:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cpufreq/3497
Note the conditions he describes are quite common. Also the OP
CPU likely has C2 and even deeper sleep modi.
Another problem with throttling / p4-clockmod is that on
at least some CPUs (not necessarily P-M, but we saw this on
some P4s) is that they can create quite long user visible
latencies. You might actually get "hanging mouse pointers" 
from it if you use it with an aggressive governour like ondemand.
The normal use case for Intel throttling is to just do 
an emergency cool down in case the CPU fails (down to thermal
shutdown). And that is done transparently behind Linux's back.
