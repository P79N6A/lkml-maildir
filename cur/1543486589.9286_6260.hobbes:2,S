I'm trying to get the filename that corresponds to a particular inode. I
know that it is not stored in the inode itself, but as a directory
entry. I'm trying to implement some type of auditing on the ext2
filesystem. ie, when I read a particular file, it will put something in
the logs stating that the file was accessed.
