I am assuming that this has something to do with the kernel so here it goes. I 
am looking for a smallest possible font for my console without using 
svgatextmode I am currently using gr8x6 which I found on the net however this is 
too big for my tastes and I would like to know if anyone has actually written 
one smaller or if this can be shrunk down and where to get something like this.
Please rely to me directly
thanks in advance
