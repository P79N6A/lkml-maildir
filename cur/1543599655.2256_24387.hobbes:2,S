Were people's heads on backwards when they wrote the ioctl?  Quite simply:
if an ugly hack has to be put in place, put it in the right place.  In
this case, it would have been *trivial* to put the UGLY hack in
fs/block_dev.c and just make read/write transparently able to access the
end of the disk.  No adding crap to the API, and certainly not risking
truely unexpected disk io due to an incorrect ioctl.
