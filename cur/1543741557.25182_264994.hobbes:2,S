You have definitely given me a lot more information, and I do understand 
why you do it this way. The shape of the curve may be of interest I 
would think, if point3 to point4 is 30C to 40C I'm in a normal chip 
range. If they represent 40c to 85C I really worry about flames coming 
out next. That clearly can be known in the application as well, but it 
isn't as easy to to as having names like max_norm, etc.
Anyway, thinks for the expanded info, more than I expected from a 
non-question.
BTW: I see that the new G5 dual-CPU Mac does run the CPUs at 85C, liquid 
cooled. At least ComputerWorld says they do. Yikes!
