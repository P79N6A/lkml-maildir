Hi there,
More than anything else, the execution speed on modern processors seem 
to be a factor of code and data allignment.  Some processors are OK with 
16 bit word allignment, other require 32 bit word allignment and the new 
crop of processors will probably require 64 bit word allignment.
If the data accesses are not alligned for your type of processor, then 
SDRAM accesses go to hell as the bursting gets upset.
Unfortunately, this is a factor of processor architecture and the MS and 
Intel compilers support a small number of processors and can therefore 
be more easily optimized than GCC, which supports every processor in the 
whole world.
If some application of yours is very speed sensitive, then you'll have 
to insert specific allignment control switches/pragmas to force GCC to 
do things the right way for speed, but that will typically increase the 
code and data size a little.
Cheers,
--
