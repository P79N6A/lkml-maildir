Subject: Is ALSA broken in 2.5.70?

Can anyone help me figure out why ALSA is not working on my 2.5.70-bk1 
setup? I tried ALSA 0.9.2 with 2.4.21-rc5 and it worked. I tried 0.9.3c 
with 2.4.21-rc5 and it didn't work. I'm thinking I did not catch 
something important in the last change.
I'm running RedHat 9 with KDE as my desktop.
I have a AC'97 CMI9739A SiS7012 onboard sound device.
I am using the intel8x0 driver. Everything is configured as defined in 
the ALSA Documentation in the kernel doc directory. I also looked for 
more help from the ALSA site, but I can't find any help.
Has anyone gotten it to work under 2.5.70?
I have all of ALSA compiled as modules in my config except for pci 
modules which I only have the intel8x0 selection as a module.
Thanks,
David
