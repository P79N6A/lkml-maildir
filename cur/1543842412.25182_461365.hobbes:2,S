But the situation is rare full stop otherwise we'd have had more
complaints. And we do tend to care about theoretical max latency
in many other obscure paths than the scheduler.
How about if you have N/2 CPUs with lots of stuff on runqueues?
Then the other N/2 will each be scanning N/2+1 runqueues... that's
a lot of bus traffic going on which you probably don't want.

A sched-domain is per-CPU as well. Why doesn't it work?

Yes, it isn't going to be perfect, but it would at least work (which
it doesn't now) without introducing that latency.

The problem has been known about for many years. It doesn't remain
unfixed because we didn't know about this brute force patch ;)
Given that Ingo also maintains the -RT patchset, it might face a
rocky road... but if he is OK with it then OK by me for now.

I'd be really happy to move this to userspace :)
