And that wants submitting to the GNU compiler people as a bug I guess ;)
MySQL using kernel headers is a bit sad given that the same macros were
put into proper user mode headers and under even more open licenses by
the Mozilla people with Linus permission.
DRI one does seem to be a real bug.
#JG
Would that be the drm.h use of "virtual", or the lack of an standard
interrupt driven vertical sync interface?
If it's the later, I know of hundreds, if not thousands of programs that
would greatly benefit from such a feature. This, coupled with Andrew
Morton's low latency patch and the already available high resolution
timer support, and Linux could quickly become the multi-media king of
operating systems (not to mention gaming).
Thanks.
