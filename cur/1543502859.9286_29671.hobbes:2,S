Hi,
I am not familiar with linux kernel development. Now I am having a
problem of a programm (sipd server) only has segmentation fault when it
runs in linux. When the same programm (binary compiled in Solaris) runs
at Solaris, no segmentation fault. I used gdb to look at when it runs at
linux, it says:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
__pthread_sighandler (sig=-1073744808) at pthread.c: 319
pthread.c: 319: No such file or directory
I thought pthread.c is kernel or system programm. I have no idea why it
is happened and no idea how to fix it because I am not the one to write
the sipd server code (I am only a user of sipd server).
Any help or hint would be very appreciated.
Regards,
Sue Zhou
