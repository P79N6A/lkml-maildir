That was my point too. The original multiplyer was a not prime number
(neither it was an integer). And our whole trick in multiplying the
original multiplier for 2^BITS_PER_LONG is to workaround the fact that we
use integer and not floating point registers to do the calc.
So as far as the original fract-magic-number was the best, according to me
the exact value of 2^32*m should be the best multiplier too.

Exactly ;).

Fine I have nothing against taking a different path. But it must be clear
that doing that we are _not_ using the plain mul-method.

I don't follow you in this last point. Where does 0x1BBCD880 came from?
And what is `hash'? The input of the hashfn of buffers are blocks and dev.
