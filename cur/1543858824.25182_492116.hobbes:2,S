i did that a while ago and it's amazing the variation that you find
beyond the obvious:
$ grep -Er "sizeof.*/.*sizeof" . | less
...
./net/key/af_key.c:     sa->sadb_sa_len = sizeof(struct sadb_sa)/sizeof(uint64_t);
./net/xfrm/xfrm_policy.c:       int len = sizeof(struct xfrm_selector) / sizeof(u32);
./net/core/flow.c:      const int n_elem = sizeof(struct flowi) / sizeof(flow_compare_t);
./net/ipv4/netfilter/arp_tables.c:      for (i = 0; i < sizeof(*arp)/sizeof(__u32); i++)
./net/ipv4/af_inet.c:#define INETSW_ARRAY_LEN (sizeof(inetsw_array) / sizeof(struct inet_protosw))
./drivers/net/wireless/ray_cs.c:        .num_standard   = sizeof(ray_handler)/sizeof(iw_handler),
and on and on.  there's no way a cute little perl script is
going to clean up all of *that*.
so what to do?
