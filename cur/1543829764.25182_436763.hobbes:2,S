Here's what I came up with Friday before I jumped timezones back east:
void smp_replace_instruction(void *info)
{
	struct ins_replace_args *parms;
	parms = (struct ins_replace_args *) info;
	cmpxchg(parms->addr, parms->oinsn, parms->ninsn);
}
void __kprobes arch_arm_kprobe(struct kprobe *p)
{
	struct ins_replace_args parms;
	parms.addr = p->addr;
	parms.ninsn = BREAKPOINT_INSTRUCTION;
	parms.oinsn = p->opcode;
	on_each_cpu(smp_replace_instruction, &parms, 0, 1);
} etc...
After reading your notes it's probably overkill doing the cs on each cpu, since
the interrupt will discard the prefetched instructions.
