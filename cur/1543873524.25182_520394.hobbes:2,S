So maybe we should just add a new parameter to "kallsyms_lookup" to 
inform it if it is safe to take a mutex or not.
Spreading module_mutex everywhere doesn't seem like the right interface 
for several reasons:
  - new users of "kallsyms_lookup" might not be aware that they should 
take module_mutex if it is safe
  - many times we will be taking module_mutex even when we are fetching 
a kernel symbol that shouldn't require the mutex at all
  - it just creates new dependencies (hint: this patch shouldn't even 
compile with current git since module_mutex is not declared in module.h, 
not to mention compile when CONFIG_MODULES not set)
IMHO we should not expose module_mutex outside of module.c. That is just 
wrong from an encapsulation point of view.
