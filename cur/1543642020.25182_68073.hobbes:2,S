Again, with an annoying controller, and having the user change their 
requirements every so often (like once a day), I do not want to change the 
RAID setup lots. The last RAID I was working with took up to an hour to commit 
geometry changes to the disk.

Again, I wouldn't want to depend on that, for the reasons above.

Please describe this algorithm? Would this potentially mean looking at every 
block on the disk, including the giant logical disk that a RAID might present? 
Even if you only have to look at the first few bytes of each block, this is a 
lot of seeking.
