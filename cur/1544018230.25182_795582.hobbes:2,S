Subject: [PATCH 1/5] trace: do not disable wake up tracer on output of trace
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Impact: fix to erased trace output
To try not to have the outputing of a trace interfere with the wakeup
tracer, it would disable tracing while the output was printing. But
if a trace had started when it was disabled, it can show a partial
trace. To try to solve this, on closing of the tracer, it would
clear the trace buffer.
The latency tracers (wakeup and irqsoff) have two buffers. One for
recording and one for holding the max trace that is printed. The
clearing of the trace above should only affect the recording buffer.
But for some reason it would move the erased trace to the print
buffer. Probably due to a race with the closing of the trace and
the saving ofhe max race.
The above is all pretty useless, and if the user does not want the
printing of the trace to be traced itself, then the user can manual
disable tracing. This patch removes all the code that tries to keep
the output of the tracer from modifying the trace.
