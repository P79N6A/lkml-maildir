The guys that did the original ppc linux port (mainly Gary Thomas and
Cort Dougan, I believe) tended to follow the alpha and x86 linux ports
rather than the System V ABI.  There aren't any SysV-based OSes for
PowerPC still extant so it doesn't really matter.
And yes, nobody has got around to implementing CIBAUD/IBSHIFT.

Sure, we can add them.  I suggest IBSHIFT = 16 and CIBAUD = 0xff0000
(or 077600000 if we are going to continue the peculiar convention of
using octal for the C* constants).
