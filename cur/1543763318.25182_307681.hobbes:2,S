yeah.

as we've learned it through painful experience on the ext3 side, 
restarting scans where 'skipping' has to be done is unhealthy.
would it be safe to collect locked entries into a separate, local list, 
so that the restart would only see newly added entries? Then once the 
moving of all entries has been done, all the locked entries could be 
added back to the commit_list via one list_add. (can anything happen to 
those locked entries that would break this method?)
