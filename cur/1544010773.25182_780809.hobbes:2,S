Speaking of Impact: lines, is this a new fashion or what?
Looking at the ones which are already in official tree, they are either
trivially duplicating Subject: line, or effectively duplicating Subject: line,
or cover up for insufficiently informative (read: badly written) Subject: line,
or simply useless.
	Subject: sched: CPU remove deadlock fix
	Impact: fix possible deadlock in CPU hot-remove path
What prevented to write "Subject: sched: fix possible deadlock in CPU hot-remove path"?
	AMD IOMMU: __unmap_single: check for bad_dma_address instead of 0
	Impact: minor fix
Well...
I have an idea on how to make them remotely useful, but can we agree that there is
a problem arising here?
