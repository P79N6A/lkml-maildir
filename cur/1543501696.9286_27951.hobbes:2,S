Here's what this box reports...
 Q> # uname -m
 Q> i686
 Q> # uname -p
 Q> unknown
 Q> # uname -r
 Q> 2.2.10
 Q> # uname -s
 Q> Linux
 Q> # uname -v
 Q> #2 SMP Mon Jun 14 16:51:11 BST 1999
Anything wrong with that?

At least on this system, `uname -p` doesn't return anything useful...
Best wishes from Riley.
