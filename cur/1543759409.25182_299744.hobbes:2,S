I should be able to easily add O_SYNC check to FiSC.  Several questions:
1. Does O_SYNC apply to directory as well?
2. For the same file, if I open twice, once with O_SYNC and another time
without, only writes through the O_SYNC fd will be sychonous, right?
3. I open a file w/o O_SYNC, issue a bunch of writes, then call
ioctl(FIOASYNC) to set the fd sync, then issure a second set of writes.
Only the second set of writes are synchronous?
btw, man page show that O_DSYNC and O_RSYNC are just O_SYNC.  Is this true
for current linux kernel (2.6)?

I checked 2.6.11 with your patch just now.  Looks like the problem is
still there.  If you need more information, let me know.  Image is at
http://fisc.stanford.edu/bug2/crash-1.img.bz2.
