The original cpuset patch did not have a notify_on_release feature, it had 
an 'autoclean' feature, that did exactly what you describe.
But the locking was not clean, mostly at the filesystem level. Paul and I 
tried together to fix it, but at some point Paul proposed this solution, 
to use a usermode helper, and it seemed to be the easiest way to get out 
of this locking issue, so we agreed to drop the old 'autoclean' scheme.
(Even if Paul had a hard time convincing me, as I did not like the idea of 
this usermode helper too much).
