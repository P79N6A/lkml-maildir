hm.  I guess I can continue to use bk until the end of July or until we hit
the 65535th cset.  After that things become murky.

yes, someone needs to set up a bk tree which is fed diffs from Linus's git
tree.  Let's call this the linus-git-bk-tree.  You then pull this into the
acpi tree.

Once you have the linus-git-bk-tree, then yes, it would be very nice if you
(or someone else) were to set up another machine which every six hours or
so does
	cd bk-acpi/
	bk pull bk://linux-acpi.bkbits.net/to-akpm
	gcapatch > /ftp-dir/bk-acpi.patch
and makes /ftp-dir available.  The same machine could also publish all the
other bk trees, such as Tony's
http://lia64.bkbits.net/linux-ia64-test-2.6.12.
  I have all the bk url's.
The fact that some developers change the bk URL between major kernel
releases will be a bit of a pain.

"flux".  I've never seen it spelled that way before ;)

OK, well once we have linus-git-bk-tree I can continue to do bk pulls until
either the bk license explodes or we hit the 65536-csets problem.
After that, the automated-patch-exports thing above would be needed.
In the very short-term, please email me the patch.  Some automated daily
thing would suit.
