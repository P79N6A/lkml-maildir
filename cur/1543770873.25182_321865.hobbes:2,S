Computer: Cyrix MII processor, VIA VP3 chipset  e-machines 1999
Kernels various, now 2.6.12-rc5
Observation: experimental ACPI sleep state, aka active standby,
appears to work with mainline kernels in that it's possible to
do
# echo standby > /sys/power/state
and have the system suspend. The computer's green led that's inset
into the power button blinks slowly, then. And pressing the power button
brings the system back, unless you wait too long. I'm not sure exactly
how long, but I guess it may be roughly an hour or so until linux
no longer returns when the power button is pressed briefly.
