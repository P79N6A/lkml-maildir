Correct... if that.  No guarantee it will make 2.6.23 either, since it 
is low priority :(

Dave Dillow and dean gaudet responded with reports that the 
BUG_ON/WARN_ON traps in would trigger:
WARNING: at drivers/ata/sata_mv.c:1287 mv_qc_issue()
	and
WARNING: at drivers/ata/sata_mv.c:1333 mv_get_crpb_status()
which leads me to think that my sata_mv new-EH patches are accidentally 
turning on NCQ mode.
I have a feeling that I will be able to reproduce this once I attach an 
NCQ-capable drive and re-test on my own systems, but again, haven't 
found the time :/
