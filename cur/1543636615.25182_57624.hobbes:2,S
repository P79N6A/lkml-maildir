(1) if you read the ksymoops manpage you'll see how to run it on a
	non-running kernel, read how to point it at a System.map
	and modules directory of your choosing and avoid using the
	/proc/ksyms of the running kernel there please
(2) to cut down on the number of variables, please reproduce it while
	the NVidia driver is not loaded and decode that ksymoops
It's not particularly useful to post non-decoded oopses.
Cheers,
Bill
