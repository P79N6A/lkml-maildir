Okay, third version, thanks to Samurai.

 You need to append resume=/dev/your_swap_partition to kernel command
 line. Then you suspend by echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep.
 
+Pavel's unreliable guide to swsusp mess
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
+
+There are currently two versions of swap suspend in the kernel, the old
+"Pavel's" version in kernel/power/swsusp.c and the new "Patrick's"
+version in kernel/power/pmdisk.c. They provide the same functionality;
+the old version looks ugly but was tested, while the new version looks
+nicer but did not receive so much testing. echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep
+calls the old version, echo disk > /sys/power/state calls the new one.
+
+[In the future, when the new version is stable enough, two things can
+happen:
+
+* the new version is moved into swsusp.c, and swsusp is renamed to swap
+  suspend (Pavel prefers this)
+
+* pmdisk is kept as is and swsusp.c is removed from the kernel]
+
 [Notice. Rest docs is pretty outdated (see date!) It should be safe to
 use swsusp on ext3/reiserfs these days.]
