firstly i would like to apologize cause i send this mail to linux-kernel
mailling list and not to linux serial but linux-serial@vger.kernel.org
don't accept the email.

in the initialization routine i enable the interrupts
"outb( UART_IER_RLSI | UART_IER_RDI | UART_IER_THRI , eib_io+UART_IER);"
where eib_io = 0x03f8.
in the writer_bottomhalf i do:
//bytes_send    :index to writer buffer which holds the package
//writer_length :length of the package i want to send
//foo           :struct timeval for debugging reasons
if(bytes_send==writer_length){   // i have send the whole package
	//starting timer to catch unacknowledged packages
}
else{
	outb(writer[bytes_send],eib_io+UART_TX);
	printk(KERN_ALERT"sending %x %ld %ld\n",
               writer[bytes_send],foo.tv_sec,foo.tv_usec);
}
return;
and in interrupt handler
static void interrupt_handler(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs){
// code for other interrupts
      if ( inb(  eib_io + UART_LSR ) & ( UART_LSR_THRE) ){
		bytes_send++;
		tasklet_schedule(&writer_tasklet);
		return;
      }
}
so whenever the interrupt handler is calling i increase the bytes_send and
i return to writer_bottomhalf to send the next character of the package.
My question is that if there are differencies in the
implementation of the UARTS between VIA and other manufacturers?
I can't understand why this piece of shit is working only in VIA.
i use 2.4.31 compiled with the same .config  except the processor's type
and chipset support in block devices section(linux serial driver
compiled as a module that i  don't load at all).
i can't understand what registers to print during boot as alan proposed
the registers from 0x03f8 - 0x03ff (aka /dev/ttyS0)?
thanks and sorry for the length of the message...
P.S: do i have to send every email to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org or to
linux-serial@vger.kernel.org
