Hi Andrew, I just noticed in 2.6.15-rc1-mm2 that ppc64/machine_kexec.c has
been moved to powerpc/machine_kexec_64.c. So my and your changes have not
taken effect.  I am attaching an incremental patch.
Thanks
Vivek
o The file ppc64/machine_kexec.c has now become powerpc/machine_kexec_64.c
  This patch removes the crash_notes definition from machine_kexec_64.c
  as crash_notes definition now has become architecture independent.
