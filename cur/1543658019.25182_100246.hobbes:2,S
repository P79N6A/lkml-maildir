Actually, we ask for 36 and get 36, but the field in the response which is
supposed to tell us how much there is total is zeroed out, instead of
having a real value.
All we need to do is recognize when that field indicates less than 36
bytes, and then stop asking for anything else.  Either (a) the device is
lying, in which case our original INQUIRY is fine, or (b) the device really
has less than 36 bytes, which means that we already have all the data.
