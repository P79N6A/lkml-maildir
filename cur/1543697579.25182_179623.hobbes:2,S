You couldn't enable that globally, because it'd break userspace
programs which write below the stack safely using sigaltstack(), or
which even use the stack pointer as a general purpose register (I've
coded games which do that in tight rendering loops), or during funky
thunking code.
It sounds like a good thing to add as a per-task feature though.
