It's an off-by-one difference, but not an 'error'.
You get:
nice +19 = 1 slice (nice +20 doesn't exist, at least not in 2.0.x)
nice +0 = 20 slices
But the linux scheduler can choose to run for a slice even processes
with 0 slices left if there are no processes with higher counter.
So you get the +1 bias you say, in agreement with the numbers 8.7% / 91.3%.
