	From feeding that to a search engine, I have now found your
dancing-makefiles-2.3.15 patch and subscribed to linux-kbuild@torque.net.
	I will look at your dancing-makefiles patch with an eye toward
being compatable and, ideally, just using your relevant changes.
	If I don't hear any complaints by the end of tomorrow, I will
will make and submit changes to modutils first.  Then, I will submit
kernel changes by, probably, mid-week.
	Thanks for the pointers and your feedback.
