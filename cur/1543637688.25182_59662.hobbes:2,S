Actually closed; the "update" patch I sent to lkml fixes it, and that's
also in 2.5.29.
As far as 2.5.29 goes, there is one outstanding serial problem - a
missing include of <asm/io.h> into 8250_pci.c (oddly my builds don't
find it.)  Oh, and 2.5.29 just has other problems elsewhere which
them cause the serial driver (and I'd imagine other subsystems) to
oops.
If someone knows of other serial problems, bring 'em on down. 8)
