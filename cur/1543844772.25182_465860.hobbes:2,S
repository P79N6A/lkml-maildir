Andi,
See http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115897798118500&w=2
for my original report.
I've now built without NO_HZ (but still HIGH_RES_TIMERS) and that fixes
the issue. You've got most of my machine specs since previous, even an
output from dmidecode, but feel free to ask for more if this bug
interests you.
I'm not particularly eager to get it solved... the nvidia driver still
needs one more hack for the glue to build against -rt3.
Mvh
Mats Johannesson
