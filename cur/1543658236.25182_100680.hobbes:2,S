Just to be clear: the vfork syscall does not use sysenter.  It's not
possible with the current implementation.  The magic sysenter wrapping
code would have to recognize the syscall and handle it special by saving
the return address.  From glibc's POV the %edx register would be free
but I consider this interface far to fragile.
