Mistakes happen. Fair enough. They happen all the time. This time around, 
for the 2.6.18-rc1 thing, I had heard more than the usual "nobody even 
reacted", as Andrew had held up two patch-series of his because of that 
issue..
So that makes me like it even less than usual when I'm told that a problem 
with something I merged was apparently known BEFORE IT WAS MERGED.
So Adrian's report on its own wouldn't have caused a revert.

As far as I can tell, you were cc'd on all of these things, along with 
the linux-acpi mailing list.
