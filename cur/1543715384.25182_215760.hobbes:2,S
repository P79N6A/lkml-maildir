Yes, it was a harmless evolutionary addition to save having a depends
SCSI && PCI on every config option in the qla2xxx/Kconfig.
However, I believe in the Kconfig language there is a way of only
sourcing the qla2xxx/Kconfig if SCSI && PCI or of making it a menu
dependent on SCSI && PCI, so the variable could be eliminated nicely
that way.
