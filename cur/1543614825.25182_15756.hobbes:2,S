I rarely get clashes in merges with either 2.2 or with 2.4-ac when I was
doing it. Offsets from multiple patches to the same file happen some times
but its very rare two people had overlapping changes and when it happened
it almost always meant that the two of them needed to talk because they were
fixing the same thing or adding related features.
The big exception is Configure.help which is a nightmare for patch, and the
one file I basically always did hand merges on
