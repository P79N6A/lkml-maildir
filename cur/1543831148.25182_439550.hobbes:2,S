It might help, but I'm not so sure.  The users have been complaining for
years (the most common complaint by far on #alsa is that OSS apps block
the soundcard) but these vendors don't seem to listen.  I doubt that
complaints in the kernel log will have an effect if they won't listen to
their users.
I've heard that one reason they won't port to ALSA is that they think
the in-kernel OSS emulation will be "fixed" someday.  Maybe we need to
make it clearer that this won't happen?
