wmb is defined as a sync instruction which will only complete once the
write has actually left the CPU, that is citing the spec "has become
globally visible".  Uncached stores such as writeX() may be held in a
writeback buffers potencially infinitely, until this buffer is needed
by another write operation.  The real surprise is to see such behaviour
in a modern piece of silicon; the only that I knew of were the R3000-class
processors and that era has ended over a decade ago, so ATI seems to have
done something funny here.
