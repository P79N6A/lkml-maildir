My understanding is that it's a very occasional (every few hours) time 
out of several seconds not something with a variance of several seconds. 
  So it seems to fit the characteristics of the type of problem that you 
are hunting i.e. every now and then going through a (rarely exercised) 
code path that hogs the CPU for too long.  But, as you say, the time 
scales are radically different.

The mode in which the scheduler was being used had all priority fiddling 
(except promotion) turned off so the tasks should have been just round 
robinning with each other.  Also, the time outs are fairly rare (every 
few hours according to Nicolas's e-mail) and happen with several 
different schedulers (with ZAPHOD (the one being used by Nicolas) and 
Con's staircase schedulers having less problem than the vanilla 
scheduler) which is why I thought it might be something outside the 
scheduler.  Perhaps it's something outside the kernel?
