Greg,
Any chance of putting my driver model changes into the driver core tree?
ISTR the reason they ended up in the USB tree was because they clashed
with the usb-pm patches.  However, if the usb-pm patches are
problematical, I'd rather my driver model changes weren't held up.
Alternatively, I could ask Linus to take them directly from me if
you're happy for that to happen.
