/me watches the flames fan out again as a bushfire
do you expect there to be any meaningful technical discussion resulting
out of you calling Jens' (valid) comments 'idiot attacks'? Fact is,
upstream couldnt care less about PREEMPT_REALTIME and/or the deadlock
detector at this point. Upstream _never_ cared about any not yet merged
(and in this case, completely unfinished) feature.
/me apologizes to Jens
