Subject: [patch] new aop block_write_begin fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

	After we enter to block_write_begin with *pagep == NULL and
 	some page was grabed we remember this page in *pagep
 	And if __block_prepare_write() we have to clear *pagep , as 
 	it was before. Because this may confuse caller.
 	for example caller may have folowing code:
 		ret = block_write_begin(..., pagep,...)
 		if (ret && *pagep != NULL) {
 			unlock_page(*pagep);
 			page_cache_release(*pagep);
 		}
