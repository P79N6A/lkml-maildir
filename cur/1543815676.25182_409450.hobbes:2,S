well this isn't really different from the normal ctrl-alt-delete right?
I would strongly suggest to follow the normal ctrl-alt-del path.. that
follows the normal convention sysadmins are used to.
It's not "/sbin/poweroff" fwiw... at least not hardcoded. Following the
normal ctrl-alt-del codepath gets all the policy out of this kind of
thing as well..
