In 2 + 3 you may increment the atomic variable in some places. The value 
of the atomic variable may not matter because you only do optimizations.
Checking a atomic_t for a definite state has to involve either
some side conditions (lock only taken if refcount is <= 0 or so) or done 
by changing the state (see f.e. atomic_inc_unless_zero).

If you want to make it less complex then drop volatile which causes weird 
side effects without solving any problems as you just pointed out.
