2.3.47 build cleanly with the latest gcc (today's CVS head).  I don't
know if it runs yet...
There are quite a few warnings about trigraphs within comments and
strings.  Several warnings about stylistic things and files which don't
end in a newline.  A few unused vars which could be nailed.  But I'm not
sure a patch would be welcome at this time?
