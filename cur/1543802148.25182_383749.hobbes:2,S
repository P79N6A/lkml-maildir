Been there, done that. Bugreport about malfunctioning (due to ACPI) 3c556 in IBM ThinkPad T20 was looked at once in a few months without any progress, 
and I've finally lost track of it after changing hardware. In more than a year this problem wasn't solved, so I'm assuming bugreports aren't so effective.
2200BG ping and packet loss problem was reported in ipw2200-devel mailing list recently (by another user), and the only answer was 
"Switch to version 1.0.0" (which is tooo old and missing needed features and bugfixes, so recommentation was unacceptable). So I'm assuming addressing 
developers directly is not too effective either. 
Two other options I see are to debug/fix it by myself and try to stimulate others monetarily. First option isn't really affordable for me , 
so I'm trying to research second.
