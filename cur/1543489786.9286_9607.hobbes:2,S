Heh. Smashed kboards help hd performance? :)

Well... I could be mistaken but it is my firm belief that I should
be getting > 170kbps on a UDMA drive. :) That is the problem. She's
lookin a tad slow :) I changed it to do 32bit io support and to turn
unmaskirq on but it didn't changeperformance any. the rest of the 
settings are as normal.
The MB is an AOpen AX6BC with v2.20 bios.
Um. If you need more info, please be a bit more specific so I know
