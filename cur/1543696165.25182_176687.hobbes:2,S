This one only has two gige cards:
tg3.c:v2.2 (August 24, 2003)
PCI: Found IRQ 54 for device 0000:01:04.0
ACPI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 0000:01:04.0 - using IRQ 54

As for the dentry and inode-cache tables, yes they're probably too big,
and they're also allocated on node 0 rather than being spread out.
