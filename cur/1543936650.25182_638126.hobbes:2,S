It sounds like you have CONFIG_PM_TRACE turned on.  From the Kconfig help:
    This enables some cheesy code to save the last PM event point in the
    RTC across reboots, so that you can debug a machine that just hangs
    during suspend (or more commonly, during resume).
[...]
    CAUTION: this option will cause your machine's real-time clock to be
    set to an invalid time after a resume.
