I disagree, 2.4.20 is the current stable kernel, it would
be nice to see how it compares to the current development,
what's faster, what's not... from Con's previous results
we can see that some things are indeed not as fast in 2.5.x
as in 2.4.x.  It's just nice to be able to see the whole
picture.  I often follow these threads for just this purpose.
