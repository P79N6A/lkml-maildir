Indeed.  Our own UMSDOS is a helluva lot cleaner design, and doesn't
have half as many problems.  It really ought to have stored the
mangled name in the directory file, though.
FAT32 as well... just as memory sizes were getting big enough that FAT
filesystems could be dealt with sanely M$ decides to screw that up.
Doing an incompatible filesystem they could have gone with a simple
inode filesystem just as easily, but no...

The right thing, I think, is what was already proposed: an ioctl() to
get the short name, an ioctl() to set the short name, and a special
version of tar or cpio to do the actual backup.  Your variant would of
course work too, using the same ioctl()s.
