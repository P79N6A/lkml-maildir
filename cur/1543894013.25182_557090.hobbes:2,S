And? There is *absolutely* *nothing* in any version of the GPL *prior* to 3 
that says that hardware cannot impose restrictions. What the GPL *does* say 
is that you can't "add additional restrictions to the license" - (IMHO) a 
piece of hardware having a restriction isn't an "additional restriction added 
to the license". As well, as Linus stated, there is nothing *anywhere* - 
AFAICT, not even in GPLv3 - that says that you have to be able to run the 
software "in place" or "on the same hardware".
If a hardware manufacturer - like TiVO - uses GPL'd code in their product - 
and complies with the terms of the license - they aren't required to allow 
you to run modified code on that hardware. Without it mentioned anywhere in 
the GPL *OR* the assorted writings of RMS (who founded the FSF and wrote the 
original GPL) that "modified software must be able to run on the same 
hardware" then it cannot be in the "spirit" of the license to allow this.

But you get the TiVO corporations copy of the software? I smell a logical

I don't. You don't get the TiVO corporations copy of the software. You get 
your own copy, with all the rights that TiVO had when receiving the software. 
The right to install and run the kernel in the TiVO device is independent of 
the rights to copy, modify, distribute and run the software. (because the GPL 
never guarantees you the right to run the software on a particular piece of 
hardware.)
