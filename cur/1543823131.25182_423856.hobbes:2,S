Interesting, I'll have to try this on some more hardware and see if I can 
reproduce there.

I was simply copying a 60MB file to the test machine via scp, in a bash while 
loop.  I haven't been doing this on my most recent runs however, and they 
still fail.  So I don't believe the net load is directly related.
I am going to work with Ingo's trace-it.c today and report back.
