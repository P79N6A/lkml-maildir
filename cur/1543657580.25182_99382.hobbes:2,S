   I was wrong about this, I'm sure I'd looked at the docs before and
found it didn't do UDMA ho hum, anyway...

   Looks like the problematic thing on 2.4.21pre2 is the -u1 switch to
hdparm.  I'd carefully tested this before and never had any trouble with
it.  I guess the IDE code has changed such that this is now a bad idea.
   I'm now on UDMA2 for hda,c,d which works fine, nice 24MB/s or so off
the hdc/d which are the big drives.  hdb is still acting weird though:
21:28:05 0$ hdparm -d1 -X34 /dev/hdb
/dev/hdb:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 setting xfermode to 34 (multiword DMA mode2)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
root@jimblewix:~;
21:28:45 0$ hdparm -i /dev/hdb
/dev/hdb:
 Model=Maxtor 82560 A4 -, FwRev=AA8Z2225, SerialNo=C40AHFXA
 Config={ Fixed }
 RawCHS=4962/16/63, TrkSize=0, SectSize=0, ECCbytes=20

 CurCHS=4962/16/63, CurSects=5001696, LBA=yes, LBAsects=5001728
 IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:120,w/IORDY:120}, tDMA={min:120,rec:120}

 DMA modes: mdma0 mdma1 mdma2 
 AdvancedPM=no WriteCache=enabled
 Drive Supports : ATA/ATAPI-4 X3T13 1153D revision 7 : ATA-1 ATA-2 ATA-3 
So, that's MDMA2 set, but hdparm -i doesn't show it (no * next to ANY
DMA or PIO mode).  Similar results for setting lower MDMA modes or any
PIO mode.  Nothing in dmesg after doing this.
