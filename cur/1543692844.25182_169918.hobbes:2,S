Hello,
I have problems to understand the CLONE_NEWNS semantic because I see
some strange behavior in combination with chroot(2).
E.g. look at the program at
                 
http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~ensc/nst.c
There, the umount(2) in 'child()' fails when the chroot is outside
/dev/root. E.g. when /var/tmp is on a separate partition, I get
    # mkdir -p /var/tmp/foo/bar && strace -f ./nst /var/tmp/foo bar
    | mount("none", "/var/tmp/foo/bar", "proc", , 0) = 0
    | chroot("/var/tmp/foo")                  = 0
    | chdir("/")                              = 0
    | clone(Process 28706 attached
    | child_stack=0xbffff7bc, flags=CLONE_NEWNS|SIGCHLD) = 28706
    | [pid 28706] --- SIGSTOP (Stopped (signal)) @ 0 (0) ---
    | [pid 28706] oldumount("bar")            = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
The umount(2) can be replaced with anything which accesses files in
"bar"---it would fail too, since "bar" is not mounted in the new
namespace.
But when doing the same in /, things are ok:
    # mkdir -p /foo/bar && strace -f ./nst /foo bar
    | mount("none", "/foo/bar", "proc", , 0)  = 0
    | chroot("/foo")                          = 0
    | chdir("/")                              = 0
    | clone(Process 28733 attached
    | child_stack=0xbffff7cc, flags=CLONE_NEWNS|SIGCHLD) = 28733
    | [pid 28733] --- SIGSTOP (Stopped (signal)) @ 0 (0) ---
    | [pid 28733] oldumount("bar")            = 0
When this behavior is wanted, what is the formal description of the
CLONE_NEWNS behavior?
