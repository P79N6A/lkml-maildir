Hi!
I have few comments...
> +System sleep states are defined as follows:

> +S1 - "Power On Suspend"
> +   - Processor power, and hence execution context, is preserved.

If S2 and S3 are same, you should use exactly same text. It seems to say
exactly same thing in slightly different words.
> +S4 - "Suspend to Disk", aka "Hibernate"
> +   - All power may be removed from the system.
> +   - All device context may be lost.
> +   - Context is usually written to persistant storage (e.g. disk).
> +   - Execution begins at processor's reset vector; the firmware
> +     will usually load the OS boot loader.
> +
> +S5 - Soft Off
> +   - Technically not a sleep state
> +   - No context is retained
> +   - OS is not responsible for saving context
> +   - OS must completely reinitialise itself on 'resume' (power-on)
> +   - Wake events may still trigger the system to resume from sleep.

                             ~~
				 this should be S5, no?
