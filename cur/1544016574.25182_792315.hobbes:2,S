Subject: [PATCH 3/4] trace: stop all recording to ring buffer on ftrace_dump
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/14/556

From: Steven Rostedt <srostedt@redhat.com>
Impact: clean up to prevent more output in ftrace dump than needed
Currently ftrace_dump only calls ftrace_kill that is a fast way
to prevent the function tracer functions from being called (just sets
a flag and clears the function to call, nothing else). It is better
to also turn off any recording to the ring buffers as well.
