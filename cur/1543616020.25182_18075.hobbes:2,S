Why not fix the problem by adding some a GCC-specific construct which
allows the programmer to say, I know what I'm doing; don't make any
assumptions about this pointer.  (i.e., "my gun, my foot, my rules").
I.e., something like this:
#hide(x)  (__builtin_gcc_this_is_not_the_pointer_you_were_looking_for__(x))
(or __builtin_gcc_jedi_mind_trick__, or pick some other name if you
like :-)
That way, you don't have to posit adding AI to GCC in the future to be
able to intuit what was going on, and programmers can take comfort in
the fact the behaviour is will defined, and won't get screwed up when
in GCC 4.0, the compiler writers decide that "Gee, most people write
inefficient assembly; so let's go and reverse engineering people's
__asm__ statements in an effort to 'optimize' their code".
