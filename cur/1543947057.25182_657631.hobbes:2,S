I've not looked deeply here, but it seems to resolve #2 and #3, we need
some way for glibc to know if it should jump to the vsyscall or make the
syscall itself.
If it always jumps to the vsyscall address, it seems we have to have
some way of falling back to syscall inside the vsyscall.
That or we need to do the NOP/un-NOP part in the update_vsyscall code
dependent on if the current clocksource supports vread, instead of on
the /proc entry access.
