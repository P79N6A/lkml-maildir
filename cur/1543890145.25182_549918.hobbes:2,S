Does the lack of comments mean that everyone on the CC list agrees with this
approach? ;-)
In the meantime, it turns out that this patch fixes the hibernation/suspend
problem with cryptd discussed in the thread at
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/26/24
 .
The problem is that cryptd doesn't call try_to_freeze() and doesn't set
PF_NOFREEZE for itself, so the freezer cannot handle it properly.  In principle
we can add either try_to_freeze() or the setting of PF_NOFREEZE to it, but if
the approach in the $subject patch is acceptable, we'll need to remove that
soon.  So, what should we do?
