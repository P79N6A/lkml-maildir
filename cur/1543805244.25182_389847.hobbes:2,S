I totally that we want the uses of pids to be clear and not over abstracted.
However most places that reference pids are debug statements are simply
line noise in any patch.
I threw together a casual patch for purposes of discussion earlier.
Not fully polished, just a rough draft for discussion and it was so big
most people didn't even receive it.  So regardless of other considerations
the sheer number size is a problem even if abstractions can't help.
I think adding a helper for the common debugging idiom of printing out
the current task is generally useful, and is worth considering on it's own merits.
In particular, does this look like a sane piece of code to add to the kernel?
This is based on analogy with dev_printk.
Either tsk_printk or something like NIP_QUAD is what I am thinking about.
