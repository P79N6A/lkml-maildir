Seems my k6-2 400 is none too happy with the mm changes in pre4-ac1.
A couple of times egcs (1.1.1) segfaulted, once while testing "make -j 8 zImage"the system froze solid. None of this happens with 2.2.0pre4.
Please let me know if any more data are needed, if I have to test with plain
gcc or if I have to buy new memory.
Thanks,
	Luca
