On the truly insane possibilities.  It is actually possible to load
a relocated bzImage.  run setup16.S below 1M and have it jump
to the kernel at any address below 4G.

True.  I at of that is general clean ups to allow the kernel to be
relocated though.  Not to actually perform the relocation.

Unfortunately the process is a little lossy :(
So that still means you still need the vmlinux to get the debug
symbols.
