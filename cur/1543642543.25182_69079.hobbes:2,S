Thanks -- that's what I implemented, except I used a semaphore instead
of a spinlock.
I wanted to check that it's safe to call `mntput' from `->release()',
which seems like quite a dubious thing to depend on.  But if you say it
is safe, that's cool.

Unfortunately, your suggestion, which I ended up implementing, is not
safe from race conditions.
The problem comes during the call to `->release()'.  If that's really
the last reference to the module, than as soon as I call `mntput' the
module might be unloaded.  In practice this doesn't happen, but if there
were a long scheduling delay... (see CONFIG_PREEMPT), it could.
