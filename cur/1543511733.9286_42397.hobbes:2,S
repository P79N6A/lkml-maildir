What about just passing something along the lines of request_module("/dev/sdd4")
to the kernel module loader instead of the request_module("k-major-2")
or for example request_module("net_alias-2").
Or even better just provice a request_device("sdd", 'c', major_nr, minor_nr)
istead
and let the modprobe do anything appriopriate about it? This would be the way
as it should had been done since even the beginning of modularization...
