Hi all; let me introduce myself:  I'm the guy that does IDE sustaining 
for Google.
I'm getting ready to sit down and document the IDE ioctls.  Probably 
Documentation/hdio.txt or something like that.  Before I start though, 
is anybody already doing this?
And while I'm on the subject, we're getting ready to write a new hdio 
ioctl, an extension of HDIO_DRIVE_CMD.  The intent here is to be 
slightly more general-purpose than HDIO_DRIVE_CMD, with an eye to 
supporting the full set of SMART functionality.  Current plan is to have 
the user pass a struct containing a pointer to the argument list, a 
pointer to the data buffer, and a data buffer length value.  Consider 
this a design document; any comments and/or feature requests?
