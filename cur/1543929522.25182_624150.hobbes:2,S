 FWIW I couldn't reproduce the problem with 2.6.23.9. sched_slice()
is quite different on that kernel and _maybe_ it won't never divide
by zero.
 My original report on vendor-sec was wrong. I've said that 2.6.23.9
had the same bug but turns out the kernel I tested had the Ingo's
CFS backport patch applied. I didn't know that, I thought it was a
vanilla kernel.
 Btw, I think it's important to release a new CFS backport patch
because maybe some distro is using it (Mandriva stable kernel is
using the CFS backport patch, but we didn't update to latest
version yet).
