I got a strange problem after I updated from 2.4.34.4 to 2.4.35.1:
The kernel raid autodetection assembles my 2 raid-1 arrays, but mdstat
shows "0 blocks" for each md.
So the filesystem check complains about no valid superblock, but the
arrays seem to run fine.
After raidstop/raidstart the blocks are displayed correctly and all is
fine.
But this is no solution, because the root fs is raid.
Could it be a compiler issue, I assume there is no change in raid since
2.4.34?!?
I use GCC 4.1.2 and no LVM.
Thanks
Daniel
