Hum, my guess would have been ATA_100a.
6xy/7xy chipsets tends to be the same IDE wise and 730 is of ATA_100a type.
ATA_100a is an evolution of the chip design based on ATA_66, ATA_100 is 
a new design (timing registers moved).
Be careful, I can't guarantee that you are using correct timings, it 
might work, but it may also throw your data by the window if you don't 
pick the right timings configuration.
I'll ask precisions to SiS engineers.
hdparm -t only test read performance, and read timings are controlled by 
the drive, the IDE controller only sets *write* timings. So hdparm 
working does not guarantee anything...
If I'm wrong, the linux-kernel mailing list is CCed, I'd be corrected in 
an eye's blink...
LB.
