Pease don't introduce more typedefs. They only hide what the hell the 
thing is, which is actively _bad_ for structures, since passing a 
structure by value etc is something that should never be done, for 
example. 
The few saved characters of typing do not actually _buy_ you anything 
else, and only obscures what the thing is.
Also, it's against the Linux coding standard, which does not like adding
magic single-letter suffixes to things - that also is the case for your
strange "_s" suffix for a structure (the real suffix is "_struct").
Remember: typing out something is not bad. It's _especially_ not bad if 
the typing makes it more clear what the thing is.
I've done a global search-and-replace on the patch. The resulting patch is
actually _cleaner_, because it also matches more closely the old code
(which used "struct tq_struct"), so things like tabbed comment alignment
etc tend to be more correct (not always, but closer).
