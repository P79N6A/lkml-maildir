hm, well, this does assume that cycle_t is implemented as long long (or
unsigned long long, actually).  Which in turn assumes that u64 is
implemented as [unsigned] long long.
Not all architectures use unsigned long long for u64: some use unsigned
long.  They'll probably be OK with this change but I think I'll convert
that into plain old "-1", which just works everywhere.
