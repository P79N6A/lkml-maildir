Thank you for FIFO consideration.
me> Before initialization, does tx_loadsz left 0?

I confirmed this assumption is OK in current code,
because seiral8250_ports[] is static variable.
We will release revised patch later,
please apply our patch until your serial driver 
re-organization completes.
Thank you.
