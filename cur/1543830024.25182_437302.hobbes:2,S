And if fact in that case we don't have to do anything special because
the process pointer will always be correct.

Yes.  I tend to be against implicit namespaces references mostly because
the explicit ones tend to make the code clearer.

Yes.  Although as I recall you don't have to pass anything down very far.
Because most functions once you have done the table lookup operate
on just a subset of the table, when they are getting the real work done.

There is an element of that.  In the output path for the most part everything
works implicitly because you are in the proper context.
I need to dig out my code and start comparing to what you have done.
