I don't know how your compression algorithm works but at least on  
NTFS that bit is easy: you allocate the blocks and mark them as  
allocated then the compression engine will write non-compressed data  
to those blocks.  Basically it works like this "does compression  
block X have any sparse blocks?". If the answer is "yes" the block is  
treated as compressed data and if the answer is "no" the block is  
treated as uncompressed data.  This means that if the data cannot be  
compressed (and in some cases if the data compressed is bigger than  
the data uncompressed) the data is stored non-compressed.  That is  
the most space efficient method to do things.
An alternative would be to allocate blocks and then when the data is  
written perform the compression and free any blocks you do not need  
any more because the data has shrunk sufficiently.  Depending on the  
implementation details this could potentially create horrible  
fragmentation as you would allocate a large consecutive region and  
then go and drop random blocks from that region thus making the file  
fragmented.
