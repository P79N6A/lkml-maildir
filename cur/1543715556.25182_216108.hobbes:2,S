Hi, 
this isn't true, coz when somebody (me) has two keyboards and both returns 
another scan codes for one labeled key, so you can't use hotkeys or Khotkeys 
or another one.
It is because when you pres e-mail key, in one keyboard it returns one 
scancode and run for example will run kmail, but when you press it on second 
keyboard and it returns another scancode, it runs and it will run xterm... :(
So we need wrapper which will translate scancodes from all keyboards to 
standart scancodes and then it can be used with hotkeys and will work with 
all keyboards and will start kmail everytime on every of keyboards.
