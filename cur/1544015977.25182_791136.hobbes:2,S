The latest mcelog version (not yet released) also supports a daemon
mode btw. But the limited buffer has been also fixed already
here and replaced with more flexible per CPU buffers.

It's not hard to extend at all (I did it several times)
Adding fields is extremly simple and fully forwards and
backwards compatible. That works because mcelog asks
the kernel about the record size and just ignores any
excess data.
The only thing that cannot be done is removing old fields, but
that is difficult with ASCII parsers too (text parsers tend
to bail out when they can't find some field they expect)
They can be obsoleted fine however (happened with cpu -> extcpu)

My employer has a lot of experience with MCEs too...  And it matches your
experience.
