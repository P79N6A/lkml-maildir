  netif_rx() would have to copy the buffer.
  Right now, it just puts it on the queue towards the BH. For it to return
the skb would require that all processing occur inside of netif_rx() (a la BSD),
or that it copy the buffer.

  I think that if you had this, and you also returned skb's to this list on
a per device basis (change skb->free, I think) instead of to the general
pool, you probably eliminate your request #1.
