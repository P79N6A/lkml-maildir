Of course, people who own such a device and want to use
it with Linux have no choice but to work with you.
And you do a good job for your users, you support them
well and in return they contribute info and patches
to support new devices.
But the thing is that at mcentral.de you're the man at the top,
and your users will hardly disagree with you on core
technical questions. (Well, admittedly I'm speculating
here as I don't read your em28xx list.)
On for drivers/media/ OTOH you are just one developer among others,
and some of them choose to disagree with you. Even worse,
IIRC there wasn't even _a single_ other developer willing
to ACK your offending patch.
Now, doesn't _that_ get you thinking?
