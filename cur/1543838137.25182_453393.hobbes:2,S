It looks like a false positive to me.

blk->magic is guaranteed to be one of those two things by the first
loop.

Reading closely through the 1st loop we can see that there's no way
to get to the second loop without having one of the LEAF variants in
the magic#.  The NODE variant indicates its an internal btree node,
and we move down the btree toward the leaves, at which point we jump
out into the second loop.

Its not correct.  What I think we should do is add a third branch into
that second loop which just ASSERTs (to trip up a debug build) and set
retval to EFSCORRUPTED (to shut these tools up).
cheers.
