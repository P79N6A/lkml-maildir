It would help if you educate yourself before you wrtite to the thread.
This could help a lot to keep this discussion technical.
If a CD-ROM does not support ATAPI, you are not able to
-	open/close/lock the door.
-	Rip Audio from it.
People who really cannot affort to buy a new drive will still be able
to see the drive as read-only HD.
In addition, if the drive would support DAE via some non-standard interface
nobody would be happy with it. The DAE 	quality would be lousy and none of 
the programs that is still supported would be able to use the drive
decently for DAE.
