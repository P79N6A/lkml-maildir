Hu Michael,
I'm CC-ing the two swsusp gurus ;)

Can't comment on this one, but this message may answer your question:

Are you using the in-kernel image writer or the userspace one?
The userspace suspend tends to be faster than the kernel and you may
limit the image size in order to speed up the process (at the cost of
losing part of the page cache).

This is expected. swsusp is carried on in 4 steps:
- stops the tasks 
- shutdown the devices in order to put the system into a quiescent
  state; this is done to prevent DMA to overwrite memory while we are
  copying
- take a snapshot of the memory
- resume the devices, now it's safe to do it because we have a "safe"
  copy of the memory; we need to reactivate the devices in order to
  write out the image
- actually write the image to disk

It's caused by one of the usb related threads that has been un-frozen;
the thread does the printk() asynchronously, so it's not easy (nor
desiderable) to stop it from writing its stuff.
I think that it's only cosmetic, though IIRC usb used to have problems
with swsusp (and preemption? note to self: try with preempt enabled).
Userspace swsusp supports splash screens, so you may want to look at
a nice progress bar instead of those usb messages ;)
