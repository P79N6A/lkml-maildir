So, could you check in /var/log/messages (or whatever) to see if you
have the original error?  It might not have been written to disk if the
error is on the /var filesystem.  If that is the case, is it possible
for you to set up a serial console or network syslog to capture the
full errors?
Cheers, Andreas
