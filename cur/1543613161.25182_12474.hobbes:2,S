I have confirmed this.  rmmod cyclades && cat /proc/ioports causes the
oops (but not necessarily a system crash).  I have a applied your patch,
and repeatedly ran insmod cyclades && rmmod cyclades && cat
/proc/ioports without causing the kernel oops.

Thanks very much for the patch.
PS.  I needed to change the offsets to apply your patch to 2.4.14, but
no logic was changed.
