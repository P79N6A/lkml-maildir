The Mailman suggestion was obviously made by someone that's never
managed a list of any substantial size.  Mailman might have lots of
fancy bounce processing stuff, but man, it loves to burn CPU all day
and night working it.
I was once burdened with limping a huge mailman installation along
while the list was moved to a service that was a bit more up to
handling the task.  The list was an announce only list for some
celebrity with about 500,000 subscribers.  Mailman's bounce processing
happily burned all the CPU that might've gone to actually doing mail
delivery.  Messages took weeks to deliver.
While I'm sure that lkml doesn't attract as much crap recipients as a
famous person's announcement, I'm sure it has plenty.  I was so happy
when that list went away...
