Subject: [PATCH 2/3] fs/: Move eCryptfs & Unionfs config options into a sub-menu
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/12/281

Using The Misc filesystems sub-menu for layered/stackable filesystems only
makes it harder for users to find eCryptfs/Unionfs.
Additionally, the menu can be easily turned into a menuconfig, which could
be used to turn on any VFS/VM functionality required by layered filesystems
(there is none at the moment).
