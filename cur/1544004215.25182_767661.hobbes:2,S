Subject: [RFC,PATCH] workqueues: turn queue_work() into the "barrier" for work->func()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

To clarify, I will be happy with the "no, we don't need this" comment.
But let's suppose we have
	int VAR;
	void work_func(struct work_struct *work)
	{
		if (VAR)
			do_something();
	}
and we are doing
	VAR = 1;
	queue_work(work);
I think the caller of queue_work() has all rights to expect that
the next invocation of work_func() must see "VAR == 1", but this
is not true if the work is already pending.
	run_workqueue:
		work_clear_pending(work)
			clear_bit(WORK_STRUCT_PENDING) // no mb()
	
		call work_func()
			if (VAR)
it is possible that CPU reads VAR before before it clears _PENDING,
and queue_work() "infiltrates" in between and fails. So we can miss
an event.
I don't know if we really have such a code in kernel, and even if
we have perhaps we should fix it and do not touch workqueues. But
perhaps the current behaviour is a bit too subtle in this respect.
For example, atkbd_event_work() happens to work correctly, but only
because it does mb() implicitly.
The patch merely adds mb() after work_clear_pending(work), another
side already has the mb semantics implied by test_and_set_bit().
From now queue_work() always acts as a barrier for work->func().
