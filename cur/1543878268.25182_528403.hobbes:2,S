It is quite possible to build a kernel that has all the drivers built-in,
but still require an initrd file.  For instance, if you have a recent
RedHat or Fedora system, '/' may very well be on an LVM partition, which
means you need an initrd to do a 'lvm varyonvg' before mounting your real
root filesystem will work....
