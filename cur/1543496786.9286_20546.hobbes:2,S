Guess this would already have been reported, but I see no mention of it in
the last few hundred messages on the list. I'm running an ancient 486 with
Adaptec aha-152x SCSI card that has two different CD-ROM's and a
hard-drive plugged. Upon loading the SCSI CD-ROM (sr_mod) module, I get:
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr1 at scsi0, channel 0, id 5, lun 0
sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 0x/0x caddy
sr1: scsi3-mmc drive: 0x/0x caddy
Which is (obiviously) incorrect. These are both ANSI SCSI 2 devices for
all I know, neither uses caddy etc. Earlier, the same module gave
random-looking four-number values instead of 0x/0x, so this is apparently
closest to "undefined". The actual value returned from sr_do_ioctl() on
the MODE_SENSE call is -95. Can get more information as needed if this is
a new problem. I'm not sure about the SCSI termination, but everything
else works fine so I consider this just annoying...
