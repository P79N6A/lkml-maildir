Nice!  I like the loadable module approach much better than my
boot-time kernel option suggestion.

I cannot confirm this since the systems I am using only support
a single hotplug driver (acpiphp).

I have only tested your changes with acpiphp.

Based on my testing (see below) this appears to be true.

I have been using 2.6.24-rc3 source for my testing.

I think this sounds like a reasonable argument for not
doing what I was trying to suggest.

I am only able to test with acpiphp.  In addition to the
testing on the x3850 described below I would also like to
do some testing on an x3950 which has a mix of hotplug and
non-hotplug slots.  If this testing which I hope to complete
this week goes well, I will be satisfied.
I will let others speak for the other hotplug drivers
and platforms.

I would defer to our illustrious maintainers on this one. :)

I am now much more comfortable with your changes with respect
to acpiphp on the systems I worry about but others may have
concerns with respect to the other hotplug drivers, or even
acpiphp, on other systems.

I just tried your v5 (1/4 v3, 2/4 v3, 3/4 v5, 4/4 v5) applied 
to 2.6.24-rc3 source with acpiphp on the x3850 and found 
nothing to complain about.  About time, eh? :)
Following boot, 'pci_slot' was already loaded and slot directories
(each containing an address file) for all 6 (2 PCI-X, 4 PCIe)
slots were present.  I then successfully modprobed acpiphp and
successfully hot-removed the PCI-X and PCIe cards that were present
during boot.  I then successfully hot-added the same cards to
the slots they occupied during boot and to slots that were vacant
during boot.
I then unloaded acpiphp and pci_slot and reloaded both in
the opposite order (acpiphp 1st, pci_slot 2nd) and
successfully repeated the above hot-remove/hot-add operations. 
I then unloaded both drivers again, reloaded only acpiphp,
and successfully repeated the same hot-remove/hot-add operations.
I will let you know how it goes on the x3950.
Thanks for all your hard work on this.
Gary
