? the driver has to know.  Look at the 53c700 to see exactly how awful
it is.  This beast has byte and word registers.  When used BE, all the
byte registers alter their position (to both inb and readb).

Well ... it's like this. Native means "pass through without swapping"
and has an easy implementation on both BE and LE platforms.  Logically
io{read,write}{16,32}be would have to do byte swaps on LE platforms.
Being lazy, I'm opposed to doing the work if there's no actual use for
it, so can you provide an example of a BE bus (or device) used on a LE
platform that would actually benefit from this abstraction?
