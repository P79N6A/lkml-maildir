But does it work?
The tqueue.h patch will fix the compile time error, but I would prefer
to put that in each .c file, and not in the .h file.
The call to run_sbin_hotplug will not bind any drivers that are already
present in the kernel to the new device.  It will only call
/sbin/hotplug, which is not all that is needed.
What needs to be done is to call the same function that CardBus calls,
and remove a lot of the pci device initialization from the compaq (and
IBM) pci hotplug drivers.
It's on my list of things to do, but pretty far down, patches gladly
accepted :)
thanks,
