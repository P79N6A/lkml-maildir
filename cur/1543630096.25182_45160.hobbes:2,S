The former is for NUMAQ specific stuff, the latter was intended to
switch on clustered apic mode support, which could be used by other
machines too. Due a lack of differentiation in the past, we probably
use CONFIG_MULTIQUAD (or rather its child, clustered_apic_mode) 
in a few places where we should be using CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ. My
laziness - sorry ;-)
