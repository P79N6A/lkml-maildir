I noticed this with 131 and it still happens
with this one and I havn't seen it mentioned.
It happens when Unix98 ptys are compiled as a module.
It also still seems to make 256 of them even though i asked
for only 32.

Similarly for other symbols. I don't understand module in 2.2
so someone else will have to look into it.
Hope this helps and may 2.2 be stable!
