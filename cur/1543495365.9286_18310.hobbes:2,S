If there is a RT task "sleeping" in the runqueue it measn that all CPU are
just running RT tasks. Otherwise reschedule_idle doesn't work properly. Do
you see my point?

I am not sure what do you mean with "static process priorities" but I
think you are talking about the related/mm/avg_slice heuristics. Yes
that's the reason it make sense to run reschedule_idle() (just pointed out
in my first email).

It does affect the common case instead. At every schedule() we issue a
reschedule_idle() of the `prev' task. The common case is when the `prev'
task is != idle_taks... and prev->counter is 0.
But yes, as just said I like it even if I think it's not worthwhile. I am
not asking for removal but I only wanted to point out that my thoughts
about the issue (since I seen that Rik started talking about it).
