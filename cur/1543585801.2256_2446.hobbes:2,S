It just hangs when init scripts try to activate swap. I will look at
what is init trying to mount and decode the info that Sysrq-P gives,
but if this suggests somebody anything already known...
Sysrq-p gives different info as time goes, so perhaps it is not stuck
but caught in an infinite loop trying to mount the only swap partition
I have.
All previous av worked fine.
