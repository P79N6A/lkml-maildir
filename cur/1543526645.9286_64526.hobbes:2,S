hwclock tries to use /dev/rtc to read and set the hardware clock.
[Of course the idea is that if the kernel provides this access
then a userspace program need not try to access the hardware itself.
Today there are still machines where "hwclock --directisa" works
but "hwclock" fails, so the kernel code for rtc is not perfect yet.]
