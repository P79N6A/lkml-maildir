 My memory hasn't served me well this time.  You are right and I was
wrong.  The local APIC uses a priority model and dispenses higher vectors
first.  Given we keep level-triggered interrupts unacked for a long time
now, this really an issue.  Two intensive level-triggered interrupts can
starve the tlb flush and also local timer interrupts completely...

 Of course.  Ingo, how about the following patch?  It works for me.
