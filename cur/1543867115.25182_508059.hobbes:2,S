which is pretty irrelevant unless you have a dual C7.

If gcc generated SSE/MMX instructions that would be a bug. (hint: it doesn't).

The SSE/SSE2/SSE3 etc support for userspace is unconditional. The context switch paths will
save/restore the registers regardless of the CPU you've compiled your kernel for.
The only SSE code in the kernel is the memcpy code (which wasn't that big a win when
I last tried it on VIA due to their poor memory bandwidth), and the RAID code, which
gets tested at runtime rather than compile time.

Yes. But these aren't dependant on any CPU config options.
