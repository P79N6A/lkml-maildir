	I know that I am late here, but I'm also using a via KT133
	chipset with a Duron 600MHz and I'm using a kernel 2.2.18 here
	with the IDE patches and I'm not seeing anything of the above
	problems. Everything just works fine.
	What are you using? I'm using an Asus A7V, with BIOS 1003 (I
	didn't upgrade it, since I'm terribly scarred of it going
	wrong and not being to boot again).
	This is with kernel 2.2.18 (no signs of filesystem corruption
	also, and I have UDMA/66 enabled, but my system is not exactly
	stressed).

	While I don't have problems with the Duron above, I do have a
	486 here with 8MB of memory that I intend to use as a router
	for my local LAN, but 2.4.0 only recognizes 7MB, while 2.2.18
	recognizes all 8MB. Under 2.4.0 (I haven't tried 2.4.1 yet), I
	used a mem=8M option and it worked fine, but I don't know if
	this is indeed safe or not (I'd guess that it would be, since
	the 2.2 kernels use all memory, but you never know).
	[]s, Roger...
