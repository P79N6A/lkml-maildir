Subject: [PATCH] Replace remaining comment references to "driverfs" with "sysfs".
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/3/21

Given that all of the actual code references to "driverfs" have been
replaced with "sysfs," replace the few remaining comment references
just to be consistent.
