No, that wouldn't make sense, that's like making a workaround depend on
arch == i386.
I'm thinking that we should somehow enable this option on the n2100
built-in r8169 ports by default only.  Since the n2100 also has a mini-PCI
slot, and it is in theory possible to put an r8169 on a mini-PCI card,
the workaround probably shouldn't apply to those, so testing for
CONFIG_MACH_N2100 also isn't the right thing to do.
