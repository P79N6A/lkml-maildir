Interesting theory... So I tried to split half of the code of
dmi_id_init() to a subfunction and bingo! gcc 3.2.3 is now able to
build it properly. Thanks for the hint!

Here's a workaround for dmi-id.
Subject: Fix for __you_cannot_kmalloc_that_much failure in dmi-id
gcc 3.2 has a hard time coping with the code in dmi_id_init():
drivers/built-in.o(.init.text+0x789e): In function `dmi_id_init':
: undefined reference to `__you_cannot_kmalloc_that_much'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Moving half of the code to a separate function seems to help. This is
a no-op for gcc 4.1 which will successfully inline the code anyway.

I'll now check if I can do something similar for snd-mixer-oss.
