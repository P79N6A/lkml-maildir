Well, it'd be a lot hairier, since you need PALcode support to free temp
registers (unless I'm missing something). And you need to check access
rights (or jump back to userspace temporarily).
By the way, mb doesn't ensure that the instruction fetcher sees the new
code, you need imb. And the ret will probably confuse the branch
prediction stack.
