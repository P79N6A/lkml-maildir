It is mostly a user space issue. A DVD drive takes a couple of seconds
to decide bad things have happened. A way to lower retries is definitely
sensible but thats different.
The unexpected NULL on the 2.5 case points to IDE layer bugs too btw.
Userspace should be using a thread pulling data at least ten or fifteen
seconds ahead of the UI, even with the retries toned down.
