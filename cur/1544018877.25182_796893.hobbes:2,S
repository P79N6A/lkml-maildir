Hmm, how long does a worker run for each received packet? The thing is,
if the data is cache affine for the issuing cpu, and the worker runs
short it often doesn't make sense to run it remote, as the cache
transfer will hurt more.
If it runs longer, the balancer will usually pick it up and move it
around.
/debug/sched_features is mostly a debug tool, its not a supported/stable
tuning interface.

include/linux/sched.h:
#define SCHED_NORMAL		0
#define SCHED_FIFO		1
#define SCHED_RR		2
#define SCHED_BATCH		3
/* SCHED_ISO: reserved but not implemented yet */
#define SCHED_IDLE		5
and the posix sched_{set,get}schedule() functions.
