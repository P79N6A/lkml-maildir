It is from VMware, so best place would be news server
news.vmware.com. Pointer to patch is resent there 
almost daily, as VMware users are not able to search 
newsgroups (server supports it, but users do not), so 
just join and read all messages from any day ;-) Just 
replace skb_datarefp with skb_shinfo. You can found 
details at:
