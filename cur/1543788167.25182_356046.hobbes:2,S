There are calls to that from the pxa2xx_spi_ssp.c controller driver
which Stephen Street posted.

Unfortunately he's struggling with mailers that are mangling
his patches (tabs-to-spaces, quoted-printable, base64, etc)
so you'll have to cope for a while with wrong-formatting.
I didn't post the OMAP MicroWire driver since I've not yet split
it out from the previous non-drivermodel support, so the patch
would be useless to anyone not working with the Linux-OMAP tree.
