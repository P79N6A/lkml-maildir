Hi Paul,
	Sorry if I wasn't clear.  A flag on the futex_wait operation (or, given
the current implementation, YA multiplexed FUTEX_WAIT variant).

I think so, yes.  The kernel realizes it has to sleep, checks the thread
corresponding to the TID it just read is still alive, if not goes into
cleanup path...
