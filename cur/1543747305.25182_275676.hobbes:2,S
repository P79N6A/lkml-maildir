The 3-overwrites is for "rigid disks" only, and for "sanitize" operations
required when the media is being released from continuous protection (basically,
when you're disposing of the drive).  Clearing (for when the drive is being
kept, but re-used) only requires 1 pass.  A CF card would be handled
under different rules - I'm pretty sure it would be treated as the appropriate
class of "memory" (but admit not knowing which technology it would be).
