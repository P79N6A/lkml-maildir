I submitted a patch to XFree86 on Tuesday which drives the primary head of
G450. It's a cleaned up version of Matrox's own code, and it works on Alpha
for me. Dual head will come later - we have the example code in matroxfb to
work from. All the binary-only HALlib does is mode setup - all the
acceleration is done in the open source code anyway, even when the HALlib 
is present.
