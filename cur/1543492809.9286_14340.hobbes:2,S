Hello All,
I would like get information about How can I get the clock processor 
using Linux tools or other resource (Kernel API, library functions, etc.).
My Machine is AMD K6-II 3DNow 350Mhz, the Linux  Kernel is 2.0.34. The clock 
processor information I get in the BIOS Setup. However, these information  I 
switch in the BIOS Setup and the msg of POST is changed (e.g. AMD K6-II 
166 Mhz.). I'm doubt of my REAL clock processor.
The Windows98 system tools print the AMD-K6 ID, but don't print the clock 
value. A short loop program that I write in C (Borland CPP) run in 13 
seconds in a Pentium 166 (MS-DOS mode). This program running in the 
AMD machine is more slow, finish in 33 seconds. 
List, thanx in advance,
RMj.
