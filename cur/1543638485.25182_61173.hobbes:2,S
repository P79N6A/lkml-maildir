  [PATCH] [PATCH] PCI Hotplug patch to drivers/pci/names.c
  
  I found that both compaq and ibm PCI hotplug driver call pci_scan_slot(),
  which eventually call pci_name_device() in drivers/pci/names.c.
  
  pci_name_device() is declared as __devinit while other data are
  declared as __initdata.
  This may result in undefined behavior for example, /proc/pci.

  PCI: move the EXPORT_SYMBOL(pcibios_*) declarations to the proper file.
