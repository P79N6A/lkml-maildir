Hey,
I'm trying to determine what was the reason for mmap() on /proc/pid/mem
being removed somewhere down the road between 2.2 and 2.4. I tried to do
my homework, but Google and 2.4 changelogs do not give too many clues. I
found several other posts on this and other groups from people complaining
it's gone, but that's all...
So - where is it? Is it coming back in the future? The feature was pretty
useful for debugging and some other purposes.
Thanks,
