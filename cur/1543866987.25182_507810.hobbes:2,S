So the PnP layers put a device on IRQ 4, which is sensible

The PCMCIA layer then ignores this and takes IRQ 4 simply because
although PnP has used it the IRQ isnt currently live

The serial IRQ setup fails

This is all scary and generally not needed spew but handy for debug.
Looks like a PCMCIA layer bug. It should be respecting IRQ assignment
(not just allocation) by other resource configuration layers.
