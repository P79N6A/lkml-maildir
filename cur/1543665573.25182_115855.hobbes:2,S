Cron really isn't at fault, I saw sleep(52) return 4500000, which it
just passed into another sleep call.
The problem is a bug in do_clock_nanosleep. If it gets interrupted by a
signal, when it calculates the amount of time left, it doesn't check if
jiffies has advanced past the expire time, and can pass a negative value
to jiffies_to_timespec, which results in values around 4,500,000
((unsigned int)-1)/HZ, which ends up as sleep's return value.  The
following trivial patch appears to have fixed the problem on my system.
Hopefully this isn't wrapped.
