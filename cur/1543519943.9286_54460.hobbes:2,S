Which says that aha152x has not returned from its initialization
routine.  It is kernel code, not insmod, that determines this.

I would expect more messages, including a device scan.  In any case,
the problem is in kernel code, not kmod/modutils.  Something in aha152x
startup is hanging so the init_module() syscall is not returning to
insmod.  Ask the aha152x maintainer.

No, it is a misleading message.  What it should say is "Can't open
/lib/modules/2.3.33/modules.dep for writing".  I will fix this in
modutils 2.3.9.
