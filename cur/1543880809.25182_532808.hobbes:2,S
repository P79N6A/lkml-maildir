At first I didn't spotted your thread is "independent" and
from your second message it seems you didn't receive all, you
expected. I wonder, if there is a need and possibility to add
somewhere (I would prefer Linus' tree git's http frontend)
addresses of developers (but not maintainers), who are
interested in CC-ing about some files' patches?.

For some time I thought about using a flag (isn't there
one available after NOAUTOREL?), e.g. WORK_STRUCT_CANCEL,
as a sign:
- for a workqueue code: that the work shouldn't be queued,
nor executed, if possiblei, at first possible check.
- for a work function: to stop execution as soon as possible,
even without completing the usual job, at first possible check.
There would be a question, whether the flag should be changed
under a lock for exact synchronisation.
Cheers,
Jarek P.
PS: I hope there is no reason against going with this to lkml
