I don't think I follow the scenario you have in mind there.  When siglock
is dropped there, noone has been woken up yet.  It's just as if the sending
of SIGCONT had not begun yet.

Hmm.  It's an interesting idea.

I agree.

do_notify_parent_cldstop will always need tasklist_lock because of its
parent link.  With my patch below, the signal-posting path should never
drop and reacquire the siglock any more.  So we could just make
do_notify_parent_cldstop take the lock (read_lock nests anyway) and the
signal-posting path callers don't need to take it.
> What do you think about the approach at least?
My first reaction was that it would have the wrong semantics.  The special
effect of SIGCONT to resume the process happens at the time of signal
generation, not at signal delivery.  The CLD_CONTINUED notification to the
parent has to happen when the resumption happens.  If SIGCONT is blocked or
ignored, then the process is woken up but may never dequeue the signal.
However, in fact it will always already been in get_signal_to_deliver by
definition, since that's where stopping happens.  So it will indeed always
come out and see your check before it resumes.  The only difference then is
whether the SIGCHLD gets sent immediately at post time or only when the
resumed child actually gets scheduled.  I don't think that's a problem.
Certainly it should just be a flag or two in signal_struct.flags.  The
extra field is really too ugly.  We need to think carefully about all the
places that clear/reset ->signal->flags, though.  Note that doing two
do_notify_parent_cldstop calls in a two is redundant, since the signals
don't queue and the parent is not often going to respond so quickly that
the second one ever actually posts.  I'd be inclined to just make that an
else if.
> Hmm... Can't we make a simpler patch for the start? See below.

That is exactly what my first impulse was and what I described as opening
another can of worms.  (I almost sent the identical patch yesterday.)  Here
is what I was concerned about.  This does the CLD_CONTINUED SIGCHLD before
any wakeups, so task_struct.state is still TASK_STOPPED.  The parent can
see the SIGCHLD, call wait, and see the child still in TASK_STOPPED.  In
wait_task_stopped, a few things can happen.  It might by then have gotten
to the signal-sender's retaking of the siglock and wake_up_state; if so, it
sees p->state no longer TASK_STOPPED and/or p->exit_code no longer nonzero,
and returns 0.  Then the parent's wait goes back to sleep (or reports
nothing for WNOHANG), and it never gets a wakeup corresponding to the
CLD_CONTINUED notification, which it expects in a call using WCONTINUED.
This is why the notification comes after the wakeup.  It might be feasible
to get the right semantics with changes in wait.  But like I said, a new
can of worms.
I don't dislike the direction of your flag-setting approach above.  But
it does introduce more new subtleties that warrant more thought.  Here is
another version of my patch, that also eliminates the lock-drop for the
CLD_STOPPED notification when a group stop is still in progress.  
(Though I still haven't yet grokked how that case introduced any bug.)
What do you think?
Thanks,
Roland

[PATCH] clean up and fix SIGCONT
This reorganizes some of the signals code, replacing handle_stop_signal()
with prepare_signal() and finish_signal(), called as a pair before and
after generating any signal.  The CLD_CONTINUED notification to parent is
moved into finish_signal(), taking place after the signal is made pending
and siglock dropped.  This fixes a race where a process waking from SIGCONT
could resume application code without running its SIGCONT handler first.
