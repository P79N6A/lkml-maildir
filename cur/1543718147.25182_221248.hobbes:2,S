The IO APIC idle c1 halt patches should work fine on 2.6.5 and stop
nforce related hanging. 2.6.6 is supposed to have the "correct" fix for
the BIOS issues. Perhaps there is something else wrong with the system?
Others will have more input.. Im yet to try 2.6.6 on the nforce system
here due to the IDE caching issues.
