the broken one is:
 GNU assembler 2.14.90.0.8 20040114
the working one is:
 GNU assembler 2.16.91.0.6 20060212
i guess i found the reason for the breakage: i was using a 
cross-compiling setup via the following script:
 make -j165 bzImage ARCH=x86_64 CC='distcc /opt/crosstool/gcc-4.0.2-glibc-2.3.6/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc'
Note that i override 'CC' instead of specifying a 'CROSS' prefix. I 
suspect this means as-instr does not switch over to the 
cross-environment and thus mis-detected the gas version?
