I'm in violent agreement here.
Justin was just as anti-social of an engineer as one could get.  And,
when you put an ex-FreeBSD guy onto Linux driver maintainence, what in
the world could anyone expect. :-)
For example, instead of accepting that the symbol "current" is a
reserved symbol when compiling under the Linux kernel, he decided that
"sticking a square peg into a round hole" was a better way to deal
with this, and thus he put an "#undef current" into the adaptec driver
instead of simply renaming a structure member from "current" to
something else.
I don't know how else to define "control freak".
