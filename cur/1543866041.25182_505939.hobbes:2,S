It isn't that far off, and we could improve it if we wanted to. In
_general_ it's quite good already.

It would work quite nicely in the graphical tools, although you've
thrown me a little by wanting it in the hacker's tool 'oldconfig' too.
You obviously care more about turning stuff _on_ with 'make oldconfig'
while other people who've spoken up seem to care more, as I do, about
turning stuff _off_ that way. If I want my hand held, I'm happy enough
to use the graphical tools.
I think the answer is probably just to go ahead and implement the 'make
oldconfig_noselect' so we can all have what we want.
