I guess so. Hmm, at least I appreciate it (them) getting testing in -mm
for now. I guess I should break it in two, do you agree Hugh? Do you
like/dislike the anonymous page change?

Uh, I forget. But luckily this one should be quite correct reglardless
of pending mm changes... unless something there has fundamentally changed
the semantics or locking of PG_uptodate... which wouldn't be too surprising
actually ;)
No, it should be OK. I'll double check when I look at resubmitting it as
2 patches.
