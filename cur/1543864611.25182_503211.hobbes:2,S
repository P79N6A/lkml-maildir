Hello,
I was working on this test machine with 2.6.20-rc6. There was a
strange X log out (KDE 3.5.x). Three applications were running:
BitTorrent client, Firefox 1.5.8, and KWrite.
Suddenly, there was a log out from my work space (blank-blink for 3-4
seconds duration). Then, KDE log in screen appeared. When I logged in
back, those applications were gone!!
I would like to investigate this issue - whether it's a X bug or
something to do with kernel?. I am not running the Firewall & SELinux
(but, connected to internet).
Any inputs for this pl? This maybe OT for LKML...not sure :(
Thanks,
~Akula2
