To be frank modem DSP is the relatively easy part. The more difficult part
is the implementation and testing of all those standards; speed
negotiation, error checking, recovery, compression etc. Getting the DSP to
equalize the channel especially if you don't have much a processing power
concern is not that difficult. It is not , IMNSHO, usefull at all to have a
modem which is not a "modem". Very few people would have any use for
something which doesn't talk to the Internet, IOW, an ISP.

Gzzz. DSP is the hard part. You could use gzip for compression if you
really wanted to, and error correction is usually done with crc +
retransmits, so that's not problem, either.
Well, you could end up with driver that would only be able to connect
linux-to-linux, but I guess that it is WAY better than no driver at
all.
