Wrong. 256 (I've done this much with Fibre Channel).
Both these are driven by the bits available in the struct scsi_address
structure.
Further, the NDI framework which everything inside Solaris is shifting to
completely separates addresses out from limitations as the dev_info_t is
constructed by the nexus driver and the address can be arbitrary. In
theory this means that even without changing the target drivers the
a_target, a_lun and a_sublun fields could be recycled to be a flat 32 bit
integer which means you get 4GB seperate addresses *per HBA instance*.

Again, this is trivial. Try doing at least first level SCCLUN with 65535
luns.

The problem is more serious in what you can dig up for device nodes than
actual internal scsi addressing.
