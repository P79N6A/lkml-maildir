That is not going to work. It is too late by then. One single wrong
udelay() can corrupt your data, or crash your machine [assuming broken
hw. On good hw, no udelay is needed]. You should not run with wrong
bogomips, not even for short periods between real change and you
noticing it...
What are other possible timebases? [I'm talking i386 architecture]
loops		- thats what we have
clock counter	- changes with bogomips
rtc		- it has 32khz time base (IIRC), that gives 31usec
granularity. Not enough.
timer		- it has 16bit counter, and runs 18 times a second
when 65535 is used as divider. That gives me 0.84usec precission (good
enough). I just wonder how long it takes to do_read_hwtimer()...
Any other ideas?
