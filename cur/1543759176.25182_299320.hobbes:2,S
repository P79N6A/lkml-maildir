You're right of course Randy.  Thats an option I hadn't canceled out 
of force of habit because at one point i needed a driver for the 
advansys scsi cards that you all had rendered an opinion that it was 
broken.  IMO the maintainer had vanished.  I looked at the code, but 
came to the conclusion I was looking at a bowl of spagetti.  I'm no 
good at sorting stuff like that.
