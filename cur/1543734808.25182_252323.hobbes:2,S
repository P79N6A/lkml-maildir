Subject: [PATCH 2.4] Update Documentation/i2c/writing-clients

Hi Marcelo,
This is a quick update to the Documentation/i2c/writing-clients file. A
similar change was accepted by Greg KH in 2.6 and was also applied to
the i2c CVS repository.
The changes are about i2c client driver IDs. It used to say that chip
driver writers should ask for a unique ID. It now explains that such an
ID is not required and they can go without it. The patch additionally
features CodingStyle updates.
Fell free to apply it if you want,
thanks.

 use something descriptive here.
 
-The id should be a unique ID. The range 0xf000 to 0xffff is reserved for
-local use, and you can use one of those until you start distributing the
-driver. Before you do that, contact the i2c authors to get your own ID(s).
+If used, the id should be a unique ID. The range 0xf000 to 0xffff is
+reserved for local use, and you can use one of those until you start

+at all so you can just omit it.
 
 Don't worry about the flags field; just put I2C_DF_NOTIFY into it. This
 means that your driver will be notified when new adapters are found.
