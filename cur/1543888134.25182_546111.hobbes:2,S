I would much rather use PAGE_SIZE direct since we have access to that symbol.
I would require a small modification in most asm-*/page.h files
so ld can parse them:
#define PAGE_SIZE (1UL << PAGE_SHIFT)
will become
#define PAGE_SIZE (_AC(1,UL) << PAGE_SHIFT)
This will allow the arch's to use that symbol in assembler too
which is a win.
Then we could do something like:
#define RODATA(alignment)	\
	ALIGN(alignment)	\
And on the call site we will most likely use
	RODATA(PAGE_SIZE)
But the architecture can override it.
Full flexibility and acceptable documentation.

Will do.
And may expend the effort a bit further when attacking the .lds files.
It will be a week or two before I get at it.
