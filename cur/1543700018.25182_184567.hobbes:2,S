Edit '/etc/modprobe.conf' and change "alias char-major-<major> foo" to
"alias char-major-<major>-<minor> foo".  Or "char-major-<major>-*" if
you can't determine the minor number.
The modules themselves are supposed to export these chardev aliases, which
will obsolete the entries in '/etc/modprobe.conf', but as yet only one or
two actually do this.  I have patches that fix most of the serial drivers
and right now I'm working my way through './drivers/char/'.  But I haven't
yet sent them in.
