By me for instance.  I'm used to modules having no influence until
loaded, even at compilation time.  I'm used to in-tree and out-of-tree
modules to have exactly the same status (ignoring the binary-only
modules crap).

I suspect what you _really_ want is a "disable ipv6 entirely"
depending on CONFIG_EMBEDDED which would remove the then bloat.
Normal users would never see it and the meaning would be obvious for
the ones who care.
