Mumble, mutter, dunno.
There are two sides to kiobufs: they can be used as a front-end to get_user_pages (video-buf.c, Imran's application and at least one
proprietary mpeg streaming driver of which I am aware).  And they
can be used as a container for direct IO to a block device (mtdblk.c
and LVM1).
Nobody seems to have come forth to implement a thought-out scatter/gather,
map-user-pages library infrastructure so I'd be a bit reluctant to
break stuff without offering a replacement.
We need a general-purpose "read or write these pages to this blockdev"
library function.  For mtdblk, LVM1/LVM2 and probably swapper_space.
With that we can remove the block IO stuff from kiovecs.  And convert
the other drivers to use get_user_pages() directly into an ad-hoc private
page array.  Those things would allow kiovecs/kiobufs to be retired.
I guess we need to get more motivated about this, before some large
piece of infrastructure (EVMS/LVM2) lands in the tree using ll_rw_kiovec.
This:
generic_direct_IO(int rw, struct inode *inode, const struct iovec *iov, 
        loff_t offset, unsigned long nr_segs, get_blocks_t get_blocks)
is getting close to what we need.  But it is synchronous, and too
heavyweight for swap I/O.
