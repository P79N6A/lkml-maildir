Here is a patch.

Subject: pktcdvd: remove broken dev_t export of class devices
The pktcdvd created class devices only export some sysfs files,
but have no char dev_t registered in the driver.
At class device creation time they copy the dev_t value of the
block device to the char device, wich will register a new char
device in the driver core and userspace, with a conflicting dev_t
value.
In many cases the class devices dev_t just points to a random
USB device. This fixes the sysfs "duplicate entry" errors.
