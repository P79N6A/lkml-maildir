I actually had PAP-5760. And after applying the patches it was the
PAP-14030. During all the tests today my reiserfs got currupted. A
reiserfsck ran into a segfault when checking the semantic tree. And this
happened exactly while checking /var/log/ksymoops/20020131.log ;-) After
deleting this file reiserfsck did it's job and my 2.5.3 works now.
bye and thanks for the fix,
  Martin
