Hi *, 
Sorry for jumping into this mailing list but I do not know how to solve this. 
RTFM did not work out and searching the list archives did not help either. 
Situation: 
We are using SuSE Linux 5.3 in our PC laboratory for about a year. Now it is 
time to upgrade and I am in the progress of installing Debian potato on 
the clients. Of course I installed version 2.2.12 on the clients. The 
server is still running 2.0.37 and shall be converted when all clients 
are upgraded.
Problem: 
Many programs do not work anymore when run on a NFS volume (e.g. /home...). 
They block in an SETLK call to fcntl. I need to get everything working 
without upgrading the server to 2.2.x.
Question: 
What can I do that locking is compatible with the 2.0 kernel installed before?
I found two postings about the same problem in the archive, one of them with 
a patch to the kernel. But I do not want to patch the kernel for this little 
problem - is there a way I can run a dummy lockd on the server or something? 
Or is 2.2.x needed for rpc.lockd? 
Thanks in advance
	Torsten
