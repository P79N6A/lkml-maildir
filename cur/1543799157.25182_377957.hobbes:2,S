Hi Pekka,
What other interest have you pulled up on this?  I mean, have others
shown interest in pushing something like this.  Today's slab system is
starting to become like the IDE where nobody, but a select few
sado-masochis, dare to venture in. (I've CC'd them ;)  Perhaps it would
make the addition of NUMA easier.
Maybe, putting this into RT might be a way to get it tested, and help us
with the memory management and a fully preemptible kernel.
