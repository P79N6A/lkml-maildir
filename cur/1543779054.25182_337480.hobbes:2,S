Hi
I can change the speed with my changes however there is something wrong with
taking care of failures.
If we are sending something for example have a ping command running and change
the speed with mii-tool or disconnect the cable and connect it again, the count
on ifconfig says that we are sending packages though I don't know what because
nothing arrives to the destination machine..hmm.. I can try to dump
the the network traffic
on my 10Mbit hub if needed but I don't think we are sending anything
that makes sense.
Is there any kind of test or information I can provid to help you fixing this ?
