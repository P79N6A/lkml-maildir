And the preamble, not being part of the active portion of the license, has 
absolutely *ZERO* bearing. Just as it is not the *intent* of RMS, the FSF or 
*ANY* person (or legal entity) that had a hand in crafting the GPLv2 or GPLv3 
which is looked at when determining the "intent" of the license. It is the 
intent of the person and/or "legal entity" that has placed their work under 
said license.
What is so hard to understand about that ?

And that may be what courts in Brazil believe, independent of the fact that 
the license itself *intentionally* limits itself to "copying, distribution 
and modification". That legal decision, in fact, may not have been motivated 
by the actual belief that that was the intent of the license - it could (and, 
from looking at the situation and available facts, might actually have been) 
motivated by political reasons.

In Brazil, because the courts there have rendered a judgment that the license 
requires the unlimited running of the covered work. But that is *unfairly* 
applying a license on a piece of software to the hardware on which it runs. 
Based on your logic the hardware manufacturer would have to enable people to 
run code compiled for an entirely different processor. Not that it matters in 
the least.

Not in the least. They have the rights to "copy, modify and distribute" 
the "source code for a work". That is *EXACTLY* the set of rights they have 
to the code, and it is *EXACTLY* the set of rights they pass on. The GPL does 
not apply to any *BINARY* form of the work, except for the fact that you are 
required to provide the source code that was used to generate the binary.
The GPL *clearly* defines "source code" as:
"the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it"
It goes on to state:
"For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for 
all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus 
the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable."
(Note that, since the "signing" of the TiVO kernel is part of the installation 
they *should* be including the script that does the signing. However, since 
the SHA1 key that is part of the signing process is *not* a "script" (even in 
the loosest possible definition of the term) they do not have to provide it.)
