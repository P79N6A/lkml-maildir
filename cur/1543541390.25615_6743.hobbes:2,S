Subject: [RFC] Setting RTC alarm time

Simple RFC:  How does one set the RTC alarm time?  I know you can 
try to do it via /dev/rtc.  However, on reboot, whatever was set in
the BIOS under APM type screens will blow away the RTC alarm setting.
That is, I can set an alarm via bios.
Boot up Linux, change ALM time via /dev/rtc.
Eventually boot linux again, ALM time is set to what I put in BIOS,
not what linux set via /dev/rtc.
While linux is booted, and you look at /proc/rtc, the alarm time there
reflects what I set via /dev/rtc.  The overall problem is that I want
to be able to set the alarm time via linux and have it _stick_ -- so that
If I go back into the bios, under the Power MGMT functions, the RTC
alarm will be set to what I set via /dev/rtc.
