I could see descriptors getting that large, particularly if
they're turned from binary form into text.  I seem to recall
Patrick was anticipating troubles with that 4K limit, at
some point.

But we aren't that way today.  Examples:
    - Take a multifunction PCI card ("physical device") and plug it in.
      Each function shows up as another "logical device" in the tree.
      Each such logical device gets one driver.
    - Take a composite USB device ("physical device", like a keyboard
      with hub) and plug it in.  Each logical device shows up separately.
      Each such logical device gets one driver.
The issue with USB is that it's got a much more complex configuration
model, not all of which is well supported yet in Linux.   There's a type
of device which is handled inconsistently:
    - Take a multiple-interface USB device ("physical device") and
      plug it in.  It's presented as one logical device.  BUT (!!) such
      devices need MULTIPLE drivers!!  (Example:  speaker with
      built in volume control, needs audio and HID drivers.)
I was observing that we have a chance to make things consistent.
In my experience, that's normally a good thing.  Similarly, I think USB
should handle configurations more as first class entities.  Changing
a device's config doesn't trigger driver rebinding, for example; we're
in luck, so far, that most devices don't have many configurations.

Ah, but changing usbfs is impractical at this point since lots of
userspace programs rely on it not changing.  Which is why I
was pointing this out in the context of driverfs, which can still
be improved in such ways ... "usbdevfs" was always advertised
as "preliminary", anyway! :)
