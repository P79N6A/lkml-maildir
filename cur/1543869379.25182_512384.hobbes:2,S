I have tracked this down to a broken version of gnu cpio (latest release, 2.7) 
which was used to create the initramfs archive. Bloody annoying since this 
has bitten me before! Last time I even sent the maintainer a bug report, and 
apparently a fix is in CVS waiting for the next release. Ho hum.
Sorry for the noise.
