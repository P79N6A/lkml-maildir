What about extending the namespace with leading ".." and "...".
In Unix names starting with a  "." already have the meaning of being a 
hidden/config entry.
A name starting ".." means streams/metainformation, etc. something belonging 
to the file/directory that should get backed up, copied, etc.
There could be a "..streams", "..metas" or a "..acl" entry.
If it starts with "..." it means some system specific information, like the
name of the hash algorithm used for the current directory. It's basically 
information that is not portable and not required by applications, like
"...fsplugins".
There is still the big problem of how to copy files with their associated 
streams or meta information onto a standard unix filesystem as the 
file/directory duality cannot be expressed. (It's forbidden to have
a directory + file with the same name in the same directory)
Maybe copy could create something like a ".#filename" directory for this kind
of information if the advanced features are not supported on the target 
filesystem. This is neither nice nor clean, but at least you don't loose 
information. I do not suggest that the kernel should simulate the advanced 
features with  ".#filename" directories, it's more a backup/restore thing 
that could work if it's written down properly.
