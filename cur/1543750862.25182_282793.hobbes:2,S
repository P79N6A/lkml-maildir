Dmitry,
I have tried kernels 2.6.9-rc2-bk3 and 2.6.9-rc2-bk4. I first copied the 
.config from the stripped-down 2.6.10 into the 2.6.9- directories and then 
ran make oldconfig (hopefully make oldconfig works in reverse?).  Then I 
built and ran the kernels. Both exhibit the same behavior as 2.6.10 
regarding the keyboard.
The /var/log/{dmesg,syslog,messages,kern.log} files for both kernels are 
available at:

PS:  I forgot the log_buf_len=131072, hope it's ok for you...
PPS: I also forgot "acpi=off".  Should I re-run these tests?
