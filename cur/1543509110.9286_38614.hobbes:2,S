  My guess of what is happing here is that there the original
dentry is flushed out of memory.  Then when the file is next
accessed the path has to be rebuilt.  This generate all new
dentries, so the search to find the export point fails.
The solution might be:

+++ nfsfh.c	Sun Sep 12 23:16:26 1999

Or something a long those lines.  (I am guessing.)
