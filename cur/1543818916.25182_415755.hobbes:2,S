Note they ran the benchmark on an Opteron 285 instead of a Xeon with 16 
GB of memory.    Opteron peformance currently **SUCKS** with 2.6 series 
kernels under any kind of heavy I/O due to their cloning of the ancient 
82489DX architecture for I/O interrupt access and performance.  Looks 
like the test was stakced against Linux from the start.  Should have 
used a Xeon system. 
AMD needs to get their crappy I/O performance up to snuff.  Looking at 
the test parameteres leads me to believe there was a lot of swapping on 
a system with already poor I/O performance.
