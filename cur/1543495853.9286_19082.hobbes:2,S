I had more-or-less the same problems, so hopefully this reports helps a bit.
What happens exactly I don't know. Running nfsd with debugging switched on 
looks like the calls are coming through OK. tcpdump on the client seems to 
indicate that the responses are coming in as well, but my packet-level 
knowledge of NFS is rusty. The result is processes hanging in Disk-wait; lots 
of signal 9's gets them killed and things are normal after that. Sometimes it 
works, it seems to be related with the amount of calls (eg., a 'du' over the 
mounted directory will certainly hang, while a simple 'ls' often comes through 
fine).
My test results:
2.0.35 -> 2.2.x user : OK
2.0.35 -> 2.2.x kernel: not tested
2.2.x  -> 2.0.35 user: OK
2.2.x  -> 2.2.x user : BAD
2.2.x  -> 2.2.x kernel: BAD
2.2.x + v3 patches -> 2.2.x user: BAD
Seems that something in 2.2.x fs/nfs is broken so it doesn't talk too well to 
2.2.x servers?
Hth,
Cees
