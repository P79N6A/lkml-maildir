Maybe but there is an NFS change that appears to be in the current
2.6.23-rc kernel and doesn't seem to be in 2.6.22 that is known to break
some autofs maps and also breaks amd.
I can't seem to locate the commit just now.
In the meantime what version of user space autofs and nfs-utils are you
running?
And can you post your autofs maps please?
