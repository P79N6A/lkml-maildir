It does - even if we don't use it, this stuff occupies regions in the bus
address space. If we ignore it we'll end up with incomplete resource
tree and pci_assign_resource() won't work anymore. Especially with AGP
aperture window, which tends to be large (32-128M), we'd have very good
chances to allocate a new resource (either by hotplug drivers or just
working around BIOS allocation bugs) in the middle of this window. Ouch.

Yes, and as Grant already pointed out, to deal with overlapping (or just
incorrectly allocated) regions.

[Hmm, on alpha we're doing that for years. :-)]
But even if we don't reprogram the bridge, we need to know about the
ranges that it decodes as we don't want to step on them accidentally.

I agree in general. Reasonable probing policy certainly is a good thing.
"Don't probe by default" would work wonderfully for PCI and ISA bridges -
I've yet to see one with normal BARs.
I'm just afraid that with the default "don't probe northbridges" we'll end
up with a lot more quirks than with "probe by default".
In either case, all of this can be trivially implemented on the top of
that patch. I'd suggest another pci_dev bit - "force_probe", to override
default policy:
static inline int default_probing_policy(struct pci_dev *dev)
{
	switch (dev->class >> 8) {
	case PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_ISA:
	case PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_EISA:
	case PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI:
		return 0;	/* Don't probe */
	case PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_HOST:
		return ???
	default:
		return 1;	/* Do probe */
	}
}
static void pci_read_bases(struct pci_dev *dev, unsigned int howmany, int rom)
{
	...
	if (dev->skip_probe ||
	    (!dev->force_probe && !default_probing_policy(dev)))
		return;
	/* Disable I/O & memory decoding while we size the BARs. */
	pci_read_config_word(dev, PCI_COMMAND, &cmd);
	...
Ivan.
