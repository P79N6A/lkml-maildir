Subject: [PATCH] alpha build pm_power_off hack
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This follows up Eric W. Biederman's patch of Dec 8, 2005:
  [PATCH] Don't attempt to power off if power off is not implemented.
To avoid having problems with one arch break the crosstool
builds which developers for other arch's do to ensure they
haven't added an arch-specific build bug, add a NULL
pm_power_off() function pointer definition to the alpha build.
Without this change, an alpha build fails in the final link
stage, for the missing 'pm_power_off' symbol that is used
in kernel/sys.c
If the alpha developers don't like the behaviour of '/sbin/halt'
on their kernel, I will leave that to them to figure out.
