The only performance problem with using PMDs which are shared between
kernel and user PTE pages is that you have a potential to be required to
instantiate the kernel portion of the shared PMD each time you need a
new set of page tables.  A slab for these partial PMDs is quite helpful
in this case.  
The real logistical problem with partial PMDs is just making sure that
all of the 0 ... PTRS_PER_PMD loops are correct.  The last few times
I've implemented it, I just made PTRS_PER_PMD take a PGD index, and made
sure to start all of the loops from things like pmd_index(PAGE_OFFSET)
instead of 0.  
Here are a couple of patches that allowed partial user/kernel PMDs. 
These conflicted with 4:4 and got dropped somewhere along the way, but
the generic approaches worked.  I believe they at least compiled on all
of the arches, too.
