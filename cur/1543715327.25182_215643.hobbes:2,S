why? Most hardware have an alternative time source for such time stamps.
Timer events *won't* be delivered too late, simply *because* the timer said
"don't bother checking back for X amount of time", so when that time has
expired (eg the delay) then the timer comparison tells the kernel "ok this
one is due now".
