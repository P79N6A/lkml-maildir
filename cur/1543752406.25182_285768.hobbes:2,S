Yes, exactly.  Not sure which part of my brain was misfiring when I
wrote that gibberish ;-)

The patch from Andi that I tested which fixed the issue for me was:

This looks like just a straight fix for the following from your patch (AFAICT):
-		pxm2node[pxm] = numnodes - 1;
-		numnodes++;
+		pxm2node[pxm] = num_online_nodes();
+		node_set_online(num_online_nodes());
However, what's in bk is a bit different and it too is working well:

Hope that clarifies.  Thanks.
