Good point.
Lets keep the nonreclaimable pages on a list, so we can keep
the migration code (and other code) consistent.
We can deal with lazily moving pages back to the nonreclaim
list if we find that, after one munlock, there are other
mlocking users of that page.

If we ever want to do that, we can always introduce separate
lists for those pages.
