Well, we have that problem with the slowly incrementing "last_ino" too.
Should we make "last_ino" be "static unsigned int" instead of "long"?
Does anybody actually even use the old stat() with 32-bit interfaces? We 
warn for it, and we've done so for a long time.. I dont' remember people 
even complaining about the warning, so..
