Local addition == something created just for this comp (cluster, etc). ALL

Not, of course. It's in /etc/X11/xdm as it should be according to FHS:
-- cut --
/etc/X11/xdm holds the configuration files for xdm.  These are most of
the files normally found in /usr/lib/X11/xdm.

In /etc/X11 ... At least in normal (FHS compliant) Linux systems.

This is other story :-) Of course you could have configuration local to your
account as well...

FHS is just recomendation as whole. And you are free to do anything. This is
Linux after all! But if you want to have LSB-compatible system you should
follow FHS recomendations (FHS is basis for LSB).

Yes. There are was this error more then year ago. In RedHat 5.1 xf86config
will put configuration in /etc/X11/XF86Config as it should be (just checked)...

There are NO /var/X11R6/bin, /var/X11R6/lib or /var/X11/bin or /var/X11/lib or
whatever. Why there are should be such thing as /var/X11R6/bin /var/X11R6/lib ?

/var/lock is THE ONLY place for lock files. There are NO /var/locks and
/var/spool/uucp is not link to /var/lock (what for? /var/spool/uucp is
directory for UUCP spool, not for locks!).

I'm not interested in "lawyers eye". When some specification started to be
read with "lawyers eye" this is clear sign that this specification will not
be usefull for anything: if your goal is just a formal approval then there a
plenty ways to do something 100% compatible and 100% useless. For [almost]
any specification...

What's http logs ? httpd may be ? In /var/log or in subdirectory or /var/log ...
In case of RedHat it's subdirectory: /var/log/httpd

Hm. Yes. This is out of scope of FHS :-(( May be LSB will help here.

In / , /root or /home/root according to FHS ...

User, of course.

This is clearly not system-wide logfile :-)

Hm. Not know what's so horrible there. NIS support is integrated in glibc not

At least bugs in glibc are not left unfixed forever !

How many useful information you'll got from fact that I'm use KSI-Linux 2.0 ?
To me information about libc used here (2.0.7) is much more usefull...

Not always. If you have information about libc and/or kernel -- this is always
usefull information (there are only few versions of kernel and libc :-) but
information about system name is MUCH less usefull...

Hm:
-- cut --
   It is forbidden to reproduce or distribute data carriers which have
   been reproduced without authorisation for payment without the prior
   written consent of S.u.S.E. GmbH or S.u.S.E. Linux.  Distribution of
   the YaST programme, its sources, whether amended or unamended in full
   or in part thereof, and the works derived thereof for a charge require
   the prior written consent of S.u.S.E. GmbH.
-- cut --
Have THIS as heart of "free OS" ? You are joking. I'm not crusader (like RMS)
but for me such program is clearly unappropriate and SuSE without YaST is not
very usefull (or am I wrong?). And "/var/X11/lib/xdm was alive and well on
SuSE last time I looked." -- this means that SuSE is not even FSSTND 1.2
compliant ! Gosh.

More or less. But for me all was Ok even for few systems with 5-8 partitions of
total size >20Gb...

Why not ?

Why edition of /etc/HOSTNAME file is any better then edition of
/etc/sysconfig/network file ?

Program with name "control-panel". Started automatically for root after startx.

May be. Since there are no "menu thing at startup" (in RedHat 5.1 at least)
I'm could not confirm or decline this.

If this was really linuxconf then see above.

You call THIS "hard try" ? Gosh. I'm start with find and grep in such situation
and usually in few minutes solution is found. BTW even if I'm not use not
control-panel nor linuxconf myself I found place for hostname in BOTH programs
in two minutes (while writing answer to you angry letter :-)

I not know much about menus in control-panel or linuxconf but 2 minutes was
enough to find this item in both...

Choice is yours. But I'm have a lot of RedHat based systems and they are mostly
works as expected -- you could change hostname in /etc/sysconfig/network and
enable/disable forwarding with the same file, you could call to ISP via
'ifup ppp0' and stop call via 'ifdown ppp0', etc. All works just fine (may be
menu-driven tools does not work fine in RedHat -- I'm simple not know since
I'm not use them :-)
