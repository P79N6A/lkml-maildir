I think I read your remark, yes. Thanks for the update; I hoped some strides 
had been made in that direction since then. Personally,  I know to little 
about the topic to be of any use.
I guess the best option is then using slab caches per object type, so that I 
can at least find obvious memory leaks. 
On a sidenote, it'll be interesting to see what valgrind reports once (if?) 
the kernel gets a good grinding.
