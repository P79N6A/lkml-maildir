We already have infrastructure to allow either xmon or kdb to be used,
and in fact both can be built in and you can select at runtime which
you prefer.  See the __debugger stuff in system.h.  You should just be
able to hook kgdb into that same infrastructure.  We're also planning
to move to using the die_notify stuff for getting all the significant
events to the debugger.
