Hi,
Andrew, please drop this patch. 
Nish, please stop fucking around with kernel APIs.

Nish, did you read this? Is my English this bad?

And a little later it does:
	timeout = expire - jiffies;
which means callers can get back a larger timeout.
Nish, did you check and fix _all_ users? I can easily find a number of 
users which immediately use the return value as next timeout.
There are _a_lot_ of schedule_timeout(1) for small busy loops, these are 
asking for "please schedule until next tick". Did you check that these are 
still ok?
schedule_timeout() is arguably a broken API, but can we please _first_ 
come up with a plan to fix this, before we break even more?
bye, Roman
