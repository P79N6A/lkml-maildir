Nvidia.  Already happened. 
From August:
http://www.sgi.com/newsroom/press_releases/1999/august/nvidia.html
"As a major initiative to bring a dramatic
price/performance discontinuity to the 
visualization market and accelerate
product time-to-market, SGI will incorporate 
NVIDIA's graphics technology
into new desktop graphics systems. As part of the
initiative, SGI will transfer a world-class team 
of 3D graphics engineers to NVIDIA to work on its
next-generation technology."
-Richard.
