Wrong.

That's better: it's a kernel facility to send arbitrary crap around.

Good idea. How about deciding the HDD should handle partition tables, too?
How about filesystems? Better still, abandon IDE and SCSI: just define all
storage devices to come as DIMMs and implement a hardware mmap()...

Again no, there should be a legitimate kernel interface for "put drive to
sleep" which userspace then uses.

Firmware upgrades should be done via the firmware upgrade interface from
the kernel, NOT via a "do arbitrary crap" interface.

Not really - it just shouldn't be exported to userspace.

Yep.

Yep: keep all the implementation details abstracted into the device
driver.

Indeed. Long term aim: kill this sort of crap entirely, providing an API
with proper facilities for "put drive to sleep", "upgrade drive firmware"
etc.

Agreed - that was my long term aim all along. It's just too late to make
this switch for 2.4.0, I suspect.

Agreed on both counts - so what DO we do for 2.4 in the mean time? IMO, we
should block as much of the "arbitrary screwing with hardware" API as
possible for now, and block the rest out later once we have a proper
replacement.

How so? If it blocks out some of the direct arbitrary crap, it's a step in
the right direction.

Indeed - we need a kernel interface good enough for XFree86 & co to use
instead.

Very easily. Design != source. Design precedes source, unless you're on a
doomed project. Design the product BEFORE you start building it, not
after!

If we divide use of the direct API into two categories, legit and
non-legit, it seems clearer. We need to block out both; the former needs
to be replaced by a proper API, the latter can just disappear. Andre is
trying to delete the latter category; we can deal with the former at a
later date.

I want a nice sane API, which provides proper services. A function of "do
arbitrary crap with chunks of binary data" doesn't fall into this
category.

Time for a disarmament treaty, then. Or SDI :-)

Yes - so take the nuke away. Andre is taking part of the nuke away with
his patch; the rest can follow later.

Because SOME of the power IS needed, some of the time, ATM. Take away as
much of it as possible now, then replace the remainder with conventional
weapons and remove the rest.

You do NOT need a "do arbitrary crap" interface to upgrade firmware. You
need an "upgrade firmware" interface.

It is NEVER needed, unless the API we are currently providing is
inadequate - in which case, fix the API. Don't hand out nukes on the door.

Nor can a generic userspace app. So what?

If the kernel is providing an adequate API, we no longer need ANY aspect
of the "raw crap" interface. In the mean time, we need SOME aspects - but
should block the rest.

I don't want to do low-level hardware stuff via a WWW page. Netscape is
NOT a system level diagnostic tool, so do NOT try to give it low-level
access like that!
