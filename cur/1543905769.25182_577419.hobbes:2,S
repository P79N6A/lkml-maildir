That's an interesting problem.  Thanks for the report!
I don't believe that long comma-delimited string actually has any
meaning to the kernel--as far as the kernel is concerned, it's just an
opaque object that will be passed back to mountd later (along with a
path name) to get export options.
So I suppose that string could be replaced by a hash, or maybe even just
by the ip address of the particular host--the disadvantage to the latter
being that it would require the kernel to keep a separate export for
each client address.
