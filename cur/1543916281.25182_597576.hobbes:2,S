That's certainly possible. We already pass a very small amount of data between 
the boot and resuming kernels at the moment, and it's done quite simply - by 
putting the variables we want to 'transfer' in a nosave page/section. I could 
conceive of a scheme wherein this was extended for driver data. Since the 
memory needed would depend on the drivers loaded, it would probably require 
that the space be allocated when hibernating, and the locations of structures 
be stored in the image header and then drivers notified of the locations to 
use when preparing to resume, but it could work...

... that said, I don't think the above should be necessary in most cases. I 
believe we're already calling the ACPI S4 methods in the proper order. If I 
understood correctly, Rafael put a lot of effort into learning what that was, 
and into ensuring it does get done.
