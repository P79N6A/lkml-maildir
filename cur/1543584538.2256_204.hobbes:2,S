I think that for filesystems this size you definately want to look at XFS
of JFS.  Maybe you will decide not to use them - but you should test them.
I am currently using XFS and it really works.  It currently has some
issues when used with raid 1, but it is probably the most suited for what
you want.  Exporting an XFS volume over NFS is no problem.  You can also
use xfs_growfs to change the size of your XFS partition.  I haven't had
any instability during all the time I've used XFS.
