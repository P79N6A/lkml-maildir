fam and imon also sound like they would do what you want to do.
fam works with or without the imon (inode monitor) kernel extension.
If imon is present, then fam doesn't need to poll for changes on interested
files/directories and operation is much more efficient. I think imon still
needs some work from reading the docs (is only version 0.0.2).
