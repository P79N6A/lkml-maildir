Ok, there's something fundamental we're missing here, the IDE boxes I
test on don't show this ;-)  Can you setup a serial console and capture
sysrq-t during the pause?  Or better yet setup kgdb.  
What kind of keyboard/mouse do you have?  
I'll give you an updated q->full patch on Monday, including the
__get_request_wait latency stats.
