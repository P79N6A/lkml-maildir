Yep, same as the results I've been seeing with Rik's patches beginning
from -ac9. Several of my machines run lots of simultaneous compiles using
both gcc and javac, and on a machine with 64megs RAM I've had great
results (much less sluggish) with Rik's tuning.
As a side note, -ac11 only contains Rik's eatcache portion; you may wish
to grab his hogstop diff against -ac11.

I'm using ext3-0.9.12, which Andrew Morton posted as
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/ext3-0.9.12_for_2.4.10-ac9
 a few days ago
(note: it's unofficial, which is why it's not linked on the main page). It
applied with only tiny fuzz against -ac11. The last official patch against
the -ac tree was against 2.4.9-ac9 (0.9.9), though Robert Love did put
together a patch that compiles relatively cleanly with only 1 trivial
reject against the later .10-ac series.
