Just ran out, of that sir,
If we'll need to lock away ACPI (just matter of time, my guess), we'll
stumble upon the non-interruptible down()s deep inside in the ACPI
code. So we can't guarantee and shouldn't promise it's really
interruptible.
It's not that strange that a function might fail even if it's named
"do_something()", you know. It's down() that forms an exception - it's
so simple we know it can't fail.
