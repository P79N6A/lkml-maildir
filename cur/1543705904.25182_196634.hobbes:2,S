Actually it's exactly the same here I'm just not bothered by my USB HCD 
not having an IRQ since
my USB mouse still works.
It says this when booting:
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 0000:00:02.0. Please try 
using pci=biosirq.
drivers/usb/core/hcd-pci.c: Found HC with no IRQ.  Check BIOS/PCI 
0000:00:02.0 setup!
All I can say is that in 2.6.1-rc1-mm1 it worked and I could have all my 
interrupts off the XT-PIC.
