Maybe someone can help fill me in if I missed this FAQ.  I've got a Redhat
6.1 machine here where the CDROM was working fine with their vendor
supplied kernel (modified 2.2.12).  I then recompiled their kernel,
modularizing all pieces needed to access my CDROM (ide, cdrom, isofs) and
when I mounted it next, the mount completes but it does not work
correctly.  mount shows that it's mounted but where I mounted it becomes
befuddled as so:
Premount:
drwxrwxr-x   2 root     root         4096 Oct  9  1998 cdrom
Executed:
mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom (which is hda) /mnt/cdrom
Postmount:
-r-xr-xr-x   1 root	root         0    Dec 31  1969 cdrom
The date might be slightly off, but it was something like that (I'm doing
this from memory).  So I downloaded new kernel source for 2.2.13 applied
prepatch pre4 to it and changed the options so I said yes to IDE but still
modularized idecd and isofs.  This resulted in no difference in behavior.
However, at any time I seem able to reboot into the original kernel and
use the CDROM with no problem.  
Any ideas?  I'm currently rebooting with Y to everything and will mail
back with the results.  Btw, this is my lilo.conf, there is one other
difference between the setup with their kernel and mine, I don't bother
using initrd, I'm not sure why this would make any difference.
