having thought of it for a minute, it is probably not the best design
though.
I am going to try to change vread() interface to accept kernel addresses
and make temporary kernel buffers in read_kmem() and see what happens.
Btw, Stephen mentioned kmapping user addresses but I still have not seen
any working examples of that - the stuff in mm/filemap.c only deals with a
page at a time...
Regards,
Tigran.
