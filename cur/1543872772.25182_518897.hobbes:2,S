The higher priority one always get 6-7ms whereas the lower priority one runs 
6-7ms and then one larger perfectly bound expiration amount. Basically 
exactly as I'd expect. The higher priority task gets precisely RR_INTERVAL 
maximum latency whereas the lower priority task gets RR_INTERVAL min and full 
expiration (according to the virtual deadline) as a maximum. That's exactly 
how I intend it to work. Yes I realise that the max latency ends up being 
longer intermittently on the niced task but that's -in my opinion- perfectly 
fine as a compromise to ensure the nice 0 one always gets low latency.
Eg:
nice 0 vs nice 10
nice 0:
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    7 ms
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    6 ms
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    6 ms
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    6 ms
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    6 ms
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    6 ms
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    6 ms
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    6 ms
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    6 ms
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    6 ms
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    6 ms
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    6 ms
pid 6288, prio   0, out for    6 ms
nice 10:
pid 6290, prio  10, out for    6 ms
pid 6290, prio  10, out for    6 ms
pid 6290, prio  10, out for    6 ms
pid 6290, prio  10, out for    6 ms
pid 6290, prio  10, out for    6 ms
pid 6290, prio  10, out for    6 ms
pid 6290, prio  10, out for    6 ms
pid 6290, prio  10, out for    6 ms
pid 6290, prio  10, out for    6 ms
pid 6290, prio  10, out for   66 ms
pid 6290, prio  10, out for    6 ms
pid 6290, prio  10, out for    6 ms
pid 6290, prio  10, out for    6 ms
exactly as I'd expect. If you want fixed latencies _of niced tasks_ in the 
presence of less niced tasks you will not get them with this scheduler. What 
you will get, though, is a perfectly bound relationship knowing exactly what 
the maximum latency will ever be.
Thanks for the test case. It's interesting and nice that it confirms this 
scheduler works as I expect it to.
