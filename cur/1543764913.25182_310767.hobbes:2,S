Christoph was not objcting to lack of choice, rather the opposite.  He
would like to have only the "allow_other" behavior.

You are basically right.  This would conflict slightly with 5) in that
the attributes of the root would be lost.

I don't agree that it's less obnoxious.  Root squashing and a
restricted directory (-rwx------) would have exactly the same affect:
root is denied all access.

That is exactly what you should do if you use the default_permissions
options.  You set the file mode, and the kernel checks the permission.

How would you get such I file?  I don't understand.

If I want to allow unprivileged users to be able to mount their
filesystems, then handling everything in userspace is not an option.
For example if you could mount a filesystem in which files have
user=root instead of your own user ID, you could probably confuse some
applications running as root, and cause information leak.  That's
exactly why allow_root and allow_other are disabled for normal users.
The only safe option that I can imagine is that the kernel will reset
the user and group fields of the file attributes.  This would again
require a kernel option, but would be far less useful IMO.
Thanks,
