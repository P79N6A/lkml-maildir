I was recently involved in a week long headache that resulted from
a botched filesystem resizing.  I didn't have backups (most people
don't) and I lost a lot.
I did get the chance to recreate my ext3 filesystem with 256k
inodes, as seen in ext4.  Other than the kernel and e2fsprogs, every
tool I point at the new filesystem pukes and dies, in no particular
order.
So:  bring a system down for hours to perform a dangerous operation
with tools that may be out of date, or spend five minutes with "dd" as
root on a running system -- making use of features supported by the
kernel for years?
Some people think memory changes are important enough to write
code to allow memory hotplug.  My hardware doesn't support that, but
some people have been bandying about the idea of
hibernate->hardware change->resume.

Well don't do that then.  No one should have permission to open
those files anyway, they're full of privledged data, just like the
nodes in /dev.
If the kernel's caching swap, that's... just perverse.

Intel Macs use GPT partition tables, which support a huge number
of primary partitions, and so don't support secondary partitions.
32bit Windows does not support GPT, so PC-style MBR partition tables
must also be used.  GPT was designed to coexist with MBR tools, so
this mostly works, but you're limited to the union of supported
features -- 4 primary partitions, no secondaries.
