This particular case is the one that bugs the most, but that
error matches best.
Seems like all ULPs treat socket lookup error as ICMP_MIB_INERRORS
(tcp, udp, sctp, dccp).
SCTP is a little special in that in needs to check one one piece
of data (the 'vtag') to correctly identify the connection.
If that piece doesn't match, we treat that as the same error.
