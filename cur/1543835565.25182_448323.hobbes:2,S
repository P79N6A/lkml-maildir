Actually, that *isn't* what I read regularly in lkml. Most statements of
rejection by kernel developers do *not* read "we don't care about that,
go away", but "this needs work here and there before we will accept it",
which in a way is the opposite of "we don't care".
But I am growing tired of this discussion. I tried to help, and instead
drew fire myself. My own fault of course. I misjudged the situation and
the emotional content of the ongoing dispute. I will now keep my tongue.
