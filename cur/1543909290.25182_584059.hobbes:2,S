x86_64 is the only platforms that uses ZONE_DMA32. Ia64 and other 64 bit 
platforms use ZONE_DMA for <4GB allocs.

It would leave the driver API as is for many arches.
I think s/ZONE_DMA32/ZONE_DMA would restore the one DMA zone thing which 
is good. We could drop all ZONE_DMA32 stuff that is only needed by a 
single arch.
