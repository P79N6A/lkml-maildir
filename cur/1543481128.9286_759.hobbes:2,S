Hi all.
I have read the documentation about frame-biffering and video modes, and
one thing that interest me is about linux logo on boot. I use a x86 machine
(actually a PII 333MHz), and i like to know how i can do this. I have the
tools specified in the docs, but i don't understand some things, like where
i put the image, what kind (format) of image i should use, etc.
Of course, if this feature *can* be used in x86 machines.
Thanks in advance for some tip, and sorry my poor english.
