It seems the main question is:
Is the kernel configuration mainly designed for users or for developers?
For users, showing drivers for hardware that is not present on their 
platform only causes confusion.
Only developers who want to do compile tests could benefit from 
compiling such drivers.
IMHO the kernel configuration is mainly designed for users.
We could do some kind of (X86_32 || DEVELOPER_COMPILE_TEST).
Or simply disable this driver on other platforms - these are only 
compile errors and amongst all possible problems in the kernel compile 
errors are amongst my least worries (obvious error, usually quickly 
fixed after the first bug report).
