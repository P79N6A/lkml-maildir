While the topic is raised..., I've hacked up cramfs for linear addressing to 
kill the "double buffering" effiect.  However as David mentions the block 
device support thing is an issue here.  What is a reasonable way to allow a 
cramfs partition to access the device directly, like the patch that I wrote, 
and be picked up in a reasonable way by the init system?
(Current system does some non-cool things like find out it's cramfs from 
/dev/rom <also a patch>, and within cramfs never accesses that block device 
anymore..., it's sort of silly, and _not_ the right way to do it.)
Thanks,
Shane Nay.
