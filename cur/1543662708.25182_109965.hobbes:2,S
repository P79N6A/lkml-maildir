The XATTR_KERNEL_CONTEXT flag cannot be substituted by a uid/gid change; 
it is unrelated to that; that's the whole point of it. It would be 
possible to raise some other flag (such as a capability, etc.) instead 
of passing an explicit flag, but that seems uglier and more 
problematic/error prone to me.
