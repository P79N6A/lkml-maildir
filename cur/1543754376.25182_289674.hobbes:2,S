Ok Looking at the code I have finally tracked where apci_power_off()
lives. drives/acpi/poweroff/sleep.c And it has companions in
drivers/acpi/hardware/hwsleep.c
Why I did not find this when I wall looking for things that
set pm_power_off earlier I haven't a clue because it showed up this
time.
One of the functions called by acpi_enter_sleep_state_prep has
this to say.
/******************************************************************************
 *
 * FUNCTION:    acpi_enter_sleep_state_prep
 *
 * PARAMETERS:  sleep_state         - Which sleep state to enter
 *
 * RETURN:      Status
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: Prepare to enter a system sleep state (see ACPI 2.0 spec p 231)
 *              This function must execute with interrupts enabled.
 *              We break sleeping into 2 stages so that OSPM can handle
 *              various OS-specific tasks between the two steps.
 *
 ******************************************************************************/
Since I clearly have interrupts disabled at this point we clearly have
an issue.  Not if we were using apics we would never have had interrupts
enabled when we got here so this code as coded is also broken in
an SMP context.
Cool I wonder how many more bugs work on kexec can flush out?
So the question becomes where is a good place to call 
acpi_enter_sleep_state_prep()?

What lines are printed just before that?  It would be nice
to know which part of the kernel panic if we can.
At least if you can reproduce this that would be nice.
I wonder if APM is really disabled at this point.  I guess since
I have found the ACPI bug we can save the APM bug for later.

That is probably the one legitimate glitch with this patch.  It disables
interrupts so the keyboard becomes unresponsive.  Of course if the
system is really powered down that is not an issue but...

Interesting.  
I am wondering if you see the same symptoms if you make this
your /init in a initcpio.gz.  I am wondering if some of the
issues might be related to something not being shutdown properly.

Very odd.   I was wondering how many test cases had run, before I found
the acpi bug above.  If the problem was not 100% the correlation with
this patch might have been a fluke.  I just want to be certain.

Well if you can help me track this down I would appreciate it.
Do you think you would have time to try some test patches?
