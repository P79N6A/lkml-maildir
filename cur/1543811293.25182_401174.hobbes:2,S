I don't think that this is constructive, the error must be locatable on
later versions, just reverting to a older version of the driver as a cop
out solves nothing... And it also means that we don't understand WHY it
breaks at all.
It would be much better if more ppl could hack the driver source, esp if
they themselves have a system that shows the breakage.
