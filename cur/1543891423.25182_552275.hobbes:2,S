Please check with the server provider if multi-lun is supported with the
adapter you are using.

Subject: megaraid.c, all kernel versions, problem with multi-luns
Hi,
I have a Dell PowerEdge Expandable RAID controller, with a hardware
Raid-5 at Channel 01 running perfectly, and a nCipher Crypter at Channel
02.
This controller doesn't correctly detect devices (e.g. nCipher
Crypter) with multiples LUNs. Only one LUN is detected.
At another controller (e.g. Adaptec 79xx) two LUNs were detect. I
compiled 2.6.8, 2.6.18 and 2.6.21.3 to test megaraid driver and all
failed detecting two LUNs.
I think that this is a firmware problem, but i'd like have some
opinions.
I read some docs
(
http://www.suse.de/~garloff/linux/scsi-scan/scsi-scanning.html,
http://www.ictp.trieste.it/~radionet/nuc1996/ref/howto-html/scsi-howto-2
.html)
and this problem doesn't seem to be simple.
Best regards,
