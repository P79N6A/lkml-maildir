Well, I was wondering about all the uses of __get_user; why not
probe_kernel_address() everywhere?
I think its reasonable to assume that if the signature is mapped and
correct, then everything else is mapped.  That's certainly the case for
Xen, which is why I added it.  If you think this is unclear, then I
think a comment to explain this rather than code changes is the
appropriate fix.
