I noticed in libata-core.c's ata_pci_remove_one(), that the
host_set->mmio_base gets unmapped before calling
host_set->ops->host_stop(host_set).  The problem is that I want to
access the registers mapped to host_set->mmio_base in my host_stop
routine (it's in my host_stop routine that I disable hotplug event
interrupts).
It looks safe to just swap the two calls, so we call
host_set->ops->host_stop(host_set) before we iounmap
host_set->mmio_base.  That way, my host_stop routine can still access
host_set->mmio_base.
However, I don't want to break any architectural model you may have in
mind.  Can you advise me on the proper approach I should take with this?
