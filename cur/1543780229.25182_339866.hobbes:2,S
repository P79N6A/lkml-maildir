OK having looked at it briefly I have a hunch that it may be the
fackets_out issue (when the effective MSS is reduced tcp_tso_acked
may increase fackets_out) I referred to in another thread.
However, I'd like to be more certain as to whether this is the
cause before we do anything.  So please apply this patch and
attempt to reproduce the problem.  It should give us more info
which may help in pin-pointing the problem.
Thanks,
