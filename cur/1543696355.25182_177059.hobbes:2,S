Well, if you look at the driver you'll need all files except the firmware
anyway.  And now that we have the request_firmware interface anyway I'd
bebetter to move that out of the module, at least once initramfs settles down
a bit.
The issue is more lots of tiny ifdefs - those in the C source could be easily
hidden using pdev->device comparisms (and I think I'm gonna submit a patch
for that soon, the driver already does that for ISP23XX variants without
a proper abstraction).  Those in the headers are a bit more difficult as the
register layout is a bit different sometimes.  But with doing these as unions
instead of ifdefs and splitted subroutines this should be managæble as well,
the feral driver already does this nicely.
