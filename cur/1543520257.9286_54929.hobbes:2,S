Oh it still is horrible ;-), and therefore it is something you don't
just want to implement in one big generic solution. You may want to
implement a generic interface that slow devices can use, but for some
high performance devices you really want the bigger freedom and the
option to control which parts are inlined and which are not. Ie. for a
Gigabit Ethernet or a high speed serial driver you may want to inline
parts of this in the fast path while using non-inlined versions for
the slow path bits of it (device initialization etc) to save space.
As a device driver author you may also want to use function pointers
rather than a list of if's for the non inlined case.
