vmware-any-any-update35.tar.gz should work on 2.5.74-mm2 too.
But it is not tested, I have enough troubles with 2.5.74 without mm patches...

vmmon started using 'get_user_pages' for locking pages some time ago. 
Unfortunately userspace needs looking at VA->PA mapping from time to time 
although it already retrieved this information at the time get_user_pages() 
was invoked :-( It makes userspace simpler, and it was also much faster than
any other solution before pmd/pte moved into the high memory.
