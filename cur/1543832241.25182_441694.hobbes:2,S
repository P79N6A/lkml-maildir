The variable is tested before entering the loop, of course. But
it _is_ tested and the initial state doesn't matter.
The "0x0" may be misleading so I added the note about relocation.
It _is_ BTW correct machine code.

Of course. But I don't see any address recalculations.

That's probably overkill, I can think of more cases where "volatile"
actually makes sense. Most are probably broken anyway, especially
those that aren't (guaranteed to be) atomic but the author uses them
as if they were.
BTW: barrier() isn't a lock.
