Perhaps there needs to be a standard API that knfsd can use to do many
of the (currently) non-standard dcache operations.  This would likely be
useful for other kernel-level file-servers that would be useful to have
(OpenAFS? Coda?).  Of course, I could just be totally ignorant of some
nasty reason for the unstandardized hackery, but it doesn't hurt to
ask. :-D
Cheers,
