Sorry for the long delay in testing, I was offline Wed-Friday taking some
much-needed leave time.

This didn't apply cleanly to a mmotm-0105 tree, but did apply cleanly
with the following 3 patches reverted and then this new patch applied.
	page_fault-retry-with-nopage_retry.patch
	page_fault-retry-with-nopage_retry-fix.patch
	page_fault-retry-with-nopage_retry-fix-fix.patch
not surprising, since it looks like this patch is a replacement for all 3.  It
built and booted nicely, and xmms on the resulting kernel behaves properly.
Congrats on being able to debug the problem based on my fairly weird bug
report. ;)
