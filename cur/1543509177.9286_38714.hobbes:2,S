I have to include a 'me too' here -- my PDC20246 with drives on either
channel will lock up under SMP if I run an instance of dd if=/dev/hda
of=/dev/null on one console and /dev/hdc on another within a second or so.
This was on a Tyan Tomcat IV.  I don't actually have two drives in the
machine now, so I haven't played with it lately.
