Yeah, there are a bunch of flags that aren't mutually exclusive and we
could probably recover a few.

Perhaps we need something like:
flags = page->flags;
userflags = 
	  FLAG_BIT(USER_REFERENCED, flags & PG_referenced) |
	  ...
etc. for the flags we want to export. This will let us change to
	 FLAG_BIT(USER_SLAB, PageSlab(page)) |
if we make a virtual slab bit.
And it shows up in grep.
Unfortunately, i386 test_bit is an asm inline and not a macro so we
can't hope for the compiler to fold up a bunch of identity bit
mappings for us.
