Both serial ports are already in use here Paul, one for heyu and x10 
stuff related to my home automation (mostly the outside lights), and 
the other to my Belkin ups, whose usb interface has never worked, so 
I'm stuck using serial for the BullDog interface to gkrellm.  I'd 
like to find a cheap pci rocketport as I have another vintage box in 
the basement that could use this machine as a network gateway then.  
Right now its on PL2303 usb<->serial convertor but somethings wrong 
with the handshaking on that end.
