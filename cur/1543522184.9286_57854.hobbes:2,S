No. There is no such distinction.
I guess that your question is inspired by this getpagesize() business,
so take that as example.
First of all, you can test using strace whether something leads to a syscall
or not. In the case of getpagesize() that depends on the architecture, and
on the libc version, and on whether the program was compiled statically.
(Usually [g]libc thinks it knows the answer itself, and hence does not
use a system call, except possibly in the case of a Sparc under
glibc, where the system call getpagesize() may be used. If the program
was a dynamic ELF program then pagesize is derived by the ELF loader.
On some systems sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) is used.)
You see - system call? Or not? Depends on a dozen other things.
There is no clear-cut distinction.
It so happens that the man page is in man2. There is no better place.
