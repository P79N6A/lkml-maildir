Crap-o-la.  Whether or not they're relevant depends on how well they 
happen to reflect your particular usage pattern.
There are NO benchmarks which are relevant to all users.  Understanding 
whether or not a benchmark is relevant to one's particular application 
is one of the trickiest things about benchmarks.
