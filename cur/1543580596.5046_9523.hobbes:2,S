Mapping the addresses from whichever ScrollLock combination produced
the task list to symbols produces the call trace
 do_exit <- do_signal <- tcp_destroy_sock <- inet_ioctl <- signal_return
The inet_ioctl is odd there--vsftpd doesn't explicitly call ioctl
anywhere at all and the next function before it in memory is
inet_shutdown which looks more believable. I have checked I'm looking
at the right System.map but I suppose I may have mis-transcribed the
address when writing it down. vsftpd doesn't make use of signal
handlers except to unset some existing ones and a SIGALRM handler
which I don't think would have triggered. Something like a seg fault
may have caused it (I should have seen an oops if it had happened in
kernel space) perhaps?
