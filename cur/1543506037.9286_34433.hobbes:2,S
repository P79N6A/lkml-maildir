Subject: 2.2.11 ipv6 recursive OOPS crash
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Just got 2.2.11 into recursive OOPS with commands like the following ones:
modprobe ipv6
ifconfig eth0 ipv6 add fe80::dont:reme:mber:it
ifconfig eth0 ipv6 del fe80::dont:reme:mber:it
nothing in logs; the millionth-or-so-OOPS which was on screen looked garbled enough to be worthless...
... and don't really feel like reproducing it right away ...
Anyone dare to try to reproduce it?
