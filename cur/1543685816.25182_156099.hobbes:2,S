Most of this isn't of much concern; most of the 2.4.x semantics have
largely been carried over to 2.6.x with algorithmic improvements, apart
from the same-mm heuristic (which was of dubious value anyway). Even
epochs are still there in the form of the duelling arrays, which
renders the thing vaguely timeout-based like 2.4.x.

If this would deliberate it would be a "selfish" scheduling algorithm,
where the delay in preemptively capturing the cpu is a number of ticks
equal to whatever the value of beta/alpha was chosen to be, and some
raw scheduling algorithm is used otherwise unaltered for those tasks in
the service box. I see no evidence of such an organization (it'd be
really obvious, as a queue box and service box would need to exist),
hence this is probably just something in need of a performance tweak
if it's a real problem.

Yes. The SMP issues addressed by the algorithmic improvements in the
scheduler are performance issues so severe, they may safely be called
functional issues.

This sounds like either LCFS or FB. FB's not usable out of the box for
long-running tasks, as its context switch rates are excessive there.
LCFS has some rather undesirable properties that render it unsuitable
for general purpose operating systems. Something like multilevel
processor sharing would be a much better alternative, as long-running
tasks can be classified and scheduled according to a more appropriate
discipline with a lower context switch rate while maintaining the
(essentially infinitely) strong preference for short-running tasks.

One problem with these kinds of reports is that they aren't coming with
enough information to determine if the scheduler truly is the cause of
the problem, and worse yet, assuming the scheduler did cause these
problems, this isn't enough actual information to address it. We're
going to need proper instrumentation at some point here.
Until then, when you deliver these reports, could you do the following:
(a) vmstat 1 | cat -n | tee -a vmstat.log
(b) run top under script
(c) regularly snapshot profiles with
	n=1
	while true
	do
		readprofile -n -m /boot/System.map-`uname -r` \
			| sort -k 2,2 > prof.$n
		n=`expr $n + 1`
		sleep 1
	done
while running interactivity tests?
(a) will give some moderately useful information about how much io is
	going on and interrupt and context switch rates.
(b) will report dynamic priorities and other general conditions so the
	scheduler's decisions can be examined.
(c) will determine if the issue is due to in-kernel algorithms consuming
	excessive amounts of cpu and causing application-level latency
	issues via cpu burn
Also, send in bootlogs (dmesg), so that general information about the
system can be communicated.
