The #3 machine doesn't have a secondary bus.  #1 and #2 are from 2 
different vendors (#1 Advantech - #2 Axiomtek) and I havent tried any 
othe machines.

The #1 and #2 machines are known to work with an older Adaptec ANA-62044 
4port NIC (tulip based) with an onboard Intel 21154 bridge chip.  The 
card I am having problems with uses an onboard Hint Corp HB6 Universal 
PCI-PCI bridge.
I am using a PCI analyzer and it shows the bus in an idle state after 
the lockup.  The PCI transactions just prior to the lockup show a couple 
of interrupts from the card which appear to be handled correctly.  
Anything I should be looking for in particular?
