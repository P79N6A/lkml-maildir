Instead of trying to guess when to do it, could the sleep be replaced by
setting a flag bit to indicate that a sleep was needed before using the
hardware? Then the sleep could be done when needed but no noise on the USB
bus wouldn't hurt.
1 - there may be many places, I thought of that but didn't look
    since someone will tell me if it's a problem.
2 - if you don't use USB why not just take the driver out?
It would be nice to prevent the problem, of course.
