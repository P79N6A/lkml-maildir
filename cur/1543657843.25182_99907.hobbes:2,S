Subject: [PATCH] I/O APIC confusion
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Dell 2600 could not bring up its MPT Fusion and hung there:
I/O APIC #7 at 0xFEC82000 was muddled with #8 at 0xFEC82800,
because the IO_APIC_BASE fixmap macro assumed page boundary.
No longer do I think all those I/O APIC messages at startup
a waste of log buffer!  Patch against 2.5.54: first appeared
in 2.4.18, then 2.5-dj: please apply.
Hugh
