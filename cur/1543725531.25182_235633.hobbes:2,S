Or just if (rt_task || need_resched). Another thing that may be
worthwhile thinking about is allowing softirqs to be run directly
from interrupt if the idle thread is running, maybe with an early
exit if something becomes runnable. Although this all may be going
down the path of too much complexity.
Maybe just the simple approach of "if you care about hard latency
then let ksoftirq do everything" is best?
