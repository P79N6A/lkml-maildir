No luck using that either.
I think I'm going to be driven insane from this if I don't get it soon! :)
What's odd is that accessing the earlier data in the map is more than
possible, but when I access an offset near the end (say 15mb, out of 16),
I get (user-level) segfaults.
Using mtrr_add() causes quite a few lockups.
Now, don't yell at me and call me an idiot, I'm just a newbie :)
Should I not be allocating the RAM on this device somehow?
Am I supposed to just plain use it, should it be allocated (and how? :)
Thanks
