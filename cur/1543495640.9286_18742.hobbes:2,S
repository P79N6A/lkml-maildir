A question I have to repeat, while there where no Oops's I managed
to trash couple of filesystems today while playing with 2.2.8.
Both with and w/o the userspace update process a plain bonnie
on a test partition managed to block all sync/bdflush activities,
forcing me to hard reset the machine with a lot of not so nice fsck
messages in the wake.
