It'd be nice if we didn't need to introduce any new API functions for this.
If we could just do:
struct pci_something pci_something_table[] = {
	...
	{
		...
		.dont_allocate_io_space = 1,
		...
	},
	...
};
within each driver which wants it.
But I can't think of a suitable per-device-id structure with which we can
do that :(
