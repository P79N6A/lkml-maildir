I don't know the ext3 journaling code at all, so this may or may not be
useful, but jfs has a nointegrity mode that disables writing to the
journal.  To keep it simple, I execute all of the journaling code as
normal except that when it is time to actually submit I/O to the
journal, I call the end_io routine directly.  (I first set bio->bi_size
= 0 to make it look like the I/O was successful.)  There is a bit more
cpu overhead than if we stubbed out all the journaling code, but it's a
lot safer not to have to worry about different paths of execution.

I can't comment on that.  :-)
