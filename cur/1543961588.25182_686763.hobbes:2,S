I was trying this in the past.
This never worked out very well.
I disliked the dependancies.
Either snd-pcsp was loading pcspkr,
or there had to be the global variable
to prevent the concurrent access, and
that hurts modularity.

Yep, its a copy/paste mainly.
I wanted a complete replacement.
Back then, I've been told that multiple
drivers controlling the same device is
never a good idea. But I won't be surprised
if that have changed since. :)

How?
And also, with snd-pcsp you have a
mixer control to disable the beeps,
which I find sometimes even more
usefull than the pcm sound itself. :)
