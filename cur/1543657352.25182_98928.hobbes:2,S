In my opinion, indentation in any form is irritating.
I find a left hand margin that jumps around, and in deeply nested
loops effectively makes a 132 column terminal in to an 80 column
terminal, completely pointless.
Overall, it doesn't help me to follow the program flow at all, if I
have to scroll excessively just to see lines that would be visible
without scrolling if only there were not ~40 blank columns on the
left hand side of the terminal.
