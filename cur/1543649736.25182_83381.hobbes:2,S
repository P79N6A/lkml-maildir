I know the error handling in mmaped memory is poor. But I am not talking
about that one. There are two place the mmaped memory can flush back
to disk. The one you are talking about is filemap_fdatasync() in filemap.c.
It will be called when try to unmmap or sync back to the disk. It at least
check the err when writepage fail. But it still clear the page dirty anyway,
looks bad to me.
The one I am complaining about is in vmscan.c, when kswapd try to
shink the cache. Correct me if I am wrong. kswapd will flush some mmaped
page back to disk to release some page from page cache. Even when
write page fail. Kernel will still do:
ClearPageDirty(page);
SetPageLaunder(page);
for that page. So this page will be able to used by other process.
When it have a missing page fault, it will read back the WRONG
data from the disk and cause a memory corruption.
So I am expecting something like tihs:
			if ((gfp_mask & __GFP_FS) && writepage) {
+                               unsigned long flags = page->flags;
				ClearPageDirty(page);
				SetPageLaunder(page);
				page_cache_get(page);
				spin_unlock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
-				writepage(page);
+				if (writepage(page))
+					page->flags = flags;
				page_cache_release(page);
				spin_lock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
				continue;
                        }

I am not sure how the user program handle that signal...

That is exactly the case for vmware ram file. VMware only use it to share
memory. Those are the virtual machine's memory. We don't want to write
it back to disk and we don't care what is left on the file system because
when vmware exit, we will throw the guest ram data away just like a real
machine power off ram will lost. We are not talking about machine using
flash ram :-). 
It is kswapd try to flush the data and it should take response to handle
the error. If it fail, one thing it should do is keep the page dirty
if write back fail. At least not corrupt memory like that.
If we can deliver the error to user program that would be a plus.
But this need to be fix frist.
