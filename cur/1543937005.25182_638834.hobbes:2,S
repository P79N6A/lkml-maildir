Hi Ingo,
More patches:
- rearrange paravirt.h to remove duplicate code, and to make it easy
  to drop in 4th level pagetable functions.
- fix a warning I got from clear_bit in pgtable.h
- fix up some bogosity in pte_modify
- mask NX from pte_pfn
The last two may help with the problem that Andi's seeing.
Thanks,
	J
