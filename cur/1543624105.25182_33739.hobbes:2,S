You missed:
	if (persistent)
		size = MD_NEW_SIZE_BLOCKS(size);
where MD_NEW_SIZE_BLOCKS is
#define MD_NEW_SIZE_BLOCKS(x)		((x & ~(MD_RESERVED_BLOCKS - 1)) - MD_RESERVED_BLOCKS)
and there you have your "-1".

The superblock should be located between 64K and 128K from the end of
the device, on a 64K boundary.
