I think we (FreeS/WAN) have stumbled upon structure locking issues.
They manifest themselves while processing packets using information
from kernel structures and having userspace daemons change that
information at the same time (uni-processor, but expect more issues
with SMP).
I have been looking at code from other parts of the kernel for a few
days, trying to figure out the best way to do this.
I started with start_bh_atomic(); and end_bh_atomic(); around bits of
code called from userspace that change kernel tables to prevent them
from changing something while another part of the bottom half uses the
information while processing incoming or outgoing packets.  This
simply results in a hard crash, pointing to an address that seems to
be in "way-out-woop-woop", to borrow an expression from our friends
down under...
An example of this that got mangled by the slow serial console is:

(which brings up another question:  how can I change the serial
console speed from its default of 9600?  I have tried with lilo
options, but it lasts only as long as loading the kernel, then reverts
to 9600?!?)
The address of interest is 0x40099ce0, which keeps surfacing, no
matter what I change.  kdb doesn't seem to be able to help me here...

kdb> bt

I am suspecting that I may be missing some crucial header files.
Which ones are necessary for us to use the *_bh_atomic() functions?
Another technique I have seen is to wrap the code in cli() sti() pairs
to protect it from being used while being modified, but I understand
this is a uniprocessor technique which should be deprecated?  Also, I
have most often seen it used in conjunction with saving and restoring
flags.  Details?  Opinions?
The third that I have used in the past is mutexes.  I have seen some
examples of atomic locks, but don't see what happens on the other end.
If something sets a lock, what is to prevent another part of the code
from reading it?  I was not able to find the latter.
Any hints would be great.  Is there an FAQ on kernel structure
locking?
