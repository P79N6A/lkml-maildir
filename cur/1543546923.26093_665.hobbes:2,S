I thought about it some more.  Yes, I can tell statically if I am the idle
thread or not, but how do I tell if the process that was running before me on
the CPU is the idle thread?  That's what __schedule_tail() cares about,
prev.  If we have a separate schedule for idlers they can avoid the test in
their __schedule_tail but the generic case still has to check.  As far as I
can tell having a separate schedule would allow idle threads to skip some of
the early tests in schedule() but I doubt it makes sense from a cache
footprint POV.  
Speaking of footprints, that reschedule_idle should really be turned into a
FASTCALL.  It's large and inlining creates too many copies in frequently
executed code.  __wake_up() even has two of them, check how large it is some
time.
