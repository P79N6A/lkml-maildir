I believe the technical description for the comment is "bullshit" 8)
Almost all MFM controllers and RLL controllers will only run at the
standard primary and secondary ATA address.
Given the intended use of the driver today I don't see a big problem in
requiring "hd=" although you have to question the point of this boot code
rewrite when it seems primarily to be removing features
