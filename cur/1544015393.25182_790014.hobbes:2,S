Indeed!
The debugfs and seqfile handling and handled in the statistical
tracing engine.
You just have to provide an iterator for your stat entries through two callbacks:
_ stat_start() -> gives the first entry
_ stat_next() -> iterates over the next entry
And an output callback
_ stat_show() -> print one entry from your stat list
And two optional things:
_ stat_cmp() -> compare two entries, useful if you want your stats to be sorted
_ stat_headers() -> provide the first line in your stat file, typically to describe your columns
The last thing you need is to give a name to your trace file.
You will retrieve it into /debugfs/tracing/trace_stat/your_file_name as a current snapshot
of your stats.
It is currently used by the branch tracer, and by a pending patch for a new workqueue
tracer which will provide you a simple example.
If you have any question about how to use it, don't hesitate to ask.
Frederic.
