Well, you need to enlist local addresses, not to verify, so I would suggest
inspecting `local' routing table.
But it doesn't help with the other example I provided a couple of messages
earlier: several MTAs on one system listening on their own IP addresses.
Some time ago, when I was engaged in system administration activity, almost
all my mail relays had several MTAs, each in its own chroot environments...
So, using routing in the post-install script to provide suggestion what
should be written in the configuration file is very reasonable, probably,
it's the best guess that the script can make.
