btw., UML is really easy to begin with: after you've compiled you get a
'linux' binary in the toplevel directory - just execute it via './linux'
and you'll see a Linux kernel booting - that's all you need!
Add a filesystem image via a root= parameter to that command and the UML
kernel will start booting that filesystem image. (if you are adventurous
you can even boot a real partition, but for the first user this is
strongly discouraged.) There are a number of UML-ready filesystem images
downloadable from the net.
