Hi,
When I try to compile user-mode-linux on UltraSparc-I, I get the
following error message during linking:
gcc-3.0 -o mk_task mk_task_user.o mk_task_kern.o
collect2: ld terminated with signal 11 [Segmentation fault], core dumped
I could not get any help regarding this error on the web. Is it because
of some sparc 32/64 oddities or it has something to do with the
compiler?
Any pointers will be appreciated
Thank you,
-Regards
