C++ in kernel development should be discouraged in general.  Structured
Exception handling would be a nice C++ implementation in Linux, and the
way the FS is using the name : function construct  for the VFS function
tables is very nice as well since we don't have to align the strucures. 
There are some elements that are attractive, but overall, why would a
device thread want to allocate memory from an interrupt -- it could
accidentally call one of your functions and use more stack or system
memory, and make performance suck by increasing memory bus activity
needlessly with all these little pieces of memory all over the place
being allocated and written.
Chorus was a C++ Kernel and a very good one at that the C++ layering all
over the place and B2 level security features, but it was uninteresting
too customers and did not achive mainstream adoption.
