One example would be processing of the following line on a non-sparc
computer (from linux-2.4.6-pre6/drivers/sbus/audio/Config.in):
dep_tristate '  Sun Microsystems userflash support' CONFIG_MTD_SUN_UFLASH $CONFIG_SPARC64
I think this could also come up for drivers that depend on
$CONFIG_ISA when configured for non-PC platforms that do not ask
about ISA support.
