Sometimes people don't buy new laptops, they get given them or buy a
cheap one second hand.  Such people can't afford a wireless card, or
to choose hardware, so it's nice if they can use what they have.
Why, only a couple of weeks ago I installed Debian on a Pentium 233
which someone was delighted to be given.  Old computers are cheap, but
some people can't afford $50 let alone $150.
