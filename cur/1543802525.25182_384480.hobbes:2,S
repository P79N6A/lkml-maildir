With 2.6.14.6:
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
and my keyboard works.
with 2.6.15:
i8042.c: Can't read CTR while initializing i8042.
and no PS/2 keyboard.
This happens on Dell Precision 380, x86_64 kernel with SMP/HT, no options
on kernel command line, same kernel .config (modulo make oldconfig).
I tried all solutions I found on google, none works (beside connecting
USB keyboard or disabling USB in BIOS).
