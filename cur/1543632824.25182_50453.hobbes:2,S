Really? From reading the code I have the impression that cpu_khz holds
more or less the information a "cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep MHz" gives for a
CPU at it's "normal" speed. The only place where cpu_khz is used is in
  busfreq = cpu_khz / get_cpu_multiplier() / 1000;
and this gives IMHO a wrong result if the "normal" speed of your CPU is
different from 350 MHz.

BTW: 350MHz was never the slowest K6-2, there are K6-2 @ 300 MHz.
