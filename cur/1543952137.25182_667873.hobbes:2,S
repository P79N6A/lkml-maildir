I actually ran into some problems with my Alpha, and I haven't managed to get 
get it full operational again yet.  I replaced the CPU fan, installed the new 
aboot, and left it trying to recover the filesystems.  It was an unhappy 
story all around -- damn that CMD646 chipset, I was under the impression that 
driver had acquired some recent fixups.  Anyway, if this succeeds, I'll try 
and compile up a new kernel with the patch when I get a chance.
With regard to the sound driver, the es18xx does endless looping on the first 
second or so of sound on my box (a PWS500au) unless I apply my patch, which 
just enables the alternative interupt detection code in the driver.  Even 
then, though, I believe it still only works in 8bit mode.
The sb8 driver also works for me.  For this reason, I basically decided to 
forget about my es18xx patch.  It doesn't get me anything the sb8 driver 
doesn't give me, and it forces me to keep compiling my own kernels.
Cheers!  -Tyson
PS:  The Debian 2.6.24 kernel actually panicked on me (instead of infinitely 
looping on the first second of sound) when I tried the stock es18xx driver.
