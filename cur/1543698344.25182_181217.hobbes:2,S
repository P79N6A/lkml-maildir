Ye gods I'm going to regret butting into this conversation but...
I have moved a couple servers successfully to 2.6.0-pre9, felt (over)
confident that 2.6.x would work on my busiest server. It was a mistake,
lightly loaded it worked great. As user logged in that morning the
server became unstable, processes started waiting forever and hanging,
imap mostly, later exim and openldap. I never reported it for lack of
good debugging info, I plan to take another wack at it in a month or so.
2.4.x is my only option, I would imagine I'm not in the minority here.
I do use XFS, not on this particular server but I do use it and would
like to see it included into 2.4.x for no other reason than 2.6.x is not
stable in all situations.
