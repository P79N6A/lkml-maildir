Sure, looks fine.  The new parameter should probably be documented
though, so folk know about it.

Should this help string include the compile-time maximum somehow?
What limits it to the compile-time maximum?

Can this be restricted to a range of 1 to SERIAL_8250_UARTS ?

And should we also give a pointer to the boot-time parameter (which
I think will be 8250.nr_uarts ?)
