No. The owner field is properly filled in and I did provide
the complete source code and build files for anybody who didn't
delete the email. Scanner.tar.gz was attached.
Further, unregister_chrdev() is called. Its return value is
checked. Everything is fine. I can manually remove and
reinstall the module multiple times and the resources are
always released and re-acquired.
The problem is that if you install the module and then
remove it, if you attempt to open the device-file, the
kernel will crash because it calls where the properly-
removed module used to be. It isn't there anymore.
