OK, cool, thanks.  I'll update the comment for you.
One last thing (sorry, I only just noticed):
In the error handler, we wait_for_completion(io_reset_wait).
In sym2_io_error_detected, we init_completion(io_reset_wait).
Isn't it possible that we hit the error handler before we hit the
io_error_detected path, and thus the completion wait is lost?
Since the completion is already initialised in sym_attach(), I don't
think we need to initialise it in sym2_io_error_detected().
Makes sense to just delete it?
