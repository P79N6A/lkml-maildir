Hi !
One year ago, I wanted to find a way to keep the linux logo displayed, and I 
posted this:
Many thanks for the esc sequence hint !
But it seems there's something broken with it: if I send 'esc[10;20r'
- the scrolling region is now between lines 10 and 20
- but, the cursor is moved to 0,0 instead of line 10
- and the linux logo does not appear...
Bug or feature ??
James Simmons said 'Bug. Fixed in the latest kernel.', but with a 2.6.7, the 
escape sequence has the same behavior and the logo does not appear. (cursor 
moved to 0,0 instead of line 10).
Any ideas on how to really fix that bug ?
Cheers,
