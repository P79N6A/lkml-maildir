I am not sure if the log from the OP includes all information.
I've seen already messages like this:
cdrecord: Input/output error. Cannot set SG_SET_TIMEOUT.
This should be something that I would never to expect to happen.
If the OP does not see a similar message, it seems that the call is
accepted but later ignored. I have no idea why this happens.
