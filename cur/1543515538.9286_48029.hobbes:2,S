I think you misunderstood my email. I have not said that the only way to
avoid cache pollution is to use a peripheral doing DMA to memory.
I _only_ said that if the bzero will be done in DMA from a peripheral then
we won't have to bypass the cache during loads stores. I agree this point
is not very interesting for sane CPUs.
