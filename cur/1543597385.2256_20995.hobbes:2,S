    What's worse, though the spec is not explicit on this point, it
    appears that the write cache is lost on a SCSI reset, which is
    typically used by drivers for last-resort error recovery. And of

    just the offending one.
Doesn't SCSI have a notion of write barriers?
Even if this is required, the above still works because for anything
requiring a barrier, you wait of a positive SYNCHRONIZE CACHE
