Ahh, good point. Ignore my argument - large stripes should work well. Mea 
culpa, I forgot how simple the parity thing is, and that it is "local".
However, since seeking will be limited by the checksum drive anyway (for 
writing), the advantages of large stripes in trying to keep the disks 
independent aren't as one-sided.
