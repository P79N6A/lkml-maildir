The best part about planned preemption points is that there is minimal
state to save when an interruption occurs.

Incidently human visual perception runs around 200 milliseconds
minimum and hearing/touch perception around 100 milliseconds if the
signal has to go through the brain. Of course we extend our
perceptions with tools/programs etc.
