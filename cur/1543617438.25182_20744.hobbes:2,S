We have a more interesting problem!
This does not show up in 2.5.1 which is patch base for 2.5.3-pre1.
It does show up in 2.5.2-pre10 but I have not walked the patch through
2.5.2preX series.
We have a very bad queue race that is PIO specific but really the whole
darn driver before the patch was applied.  ACB only tighten the driver's
alignment to the NCITS standards.  One should note the direct access via
the ioctl does not lock the driver.  Only coming down from BLOCK will this
event occur.
Repeatable test "hdparm -d0 -t /dev/hdx"
If you apply the acb-io patch to 2.5.1 this does not happen.
In the introduction of BIO, there were no "q->queue_lock" applied to
protecting the queue.
        /*
         * Is meant to protect the queue in the future instead of
         * io_request_lock
         */
        spinlock_t              queue_lock;
Well we pulled "io_request_lock" but did we forgot to insert or add
q->queue_lock spinlocks?
It is going to be a LONG LONG NIGHT :-(
