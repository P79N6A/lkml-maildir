Daniel, Steve,
Linus believes the reason for the "no DRQ after issuing WRITE" (and
further problems caused by it) is the too small timeout used in
ide_wait_stat().
Can you guys please change this line in include/linux/ide.h
#define WAIT_DRQ        (5*HZ/100)      /* 50msec - spec allows up to 20ms */
to
#define WAIT_DRQ	(5*HZ/50)
And check if that makes the problem go away?

Small correction: people are not hitting the WAIT_READY (they are hitting
the problem from ide-disk.c, which uses WAIT_DRQ). But still...
