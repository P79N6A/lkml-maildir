append="mem=exactmap mem=640K@0 mem=1023M@1M" solved the memory issue in RH's 
latest kernel (2.4.18-18.7.xsmp) and in (2.4.20smp-ac1). However, ac1 only 
uses ~900MB whereas RH uses all of the RAM, but I think that's because I 
turned highmem of when building ac1.
This answers several questions that I had about RH's last two releases (7.3 & 
8.0). Neither release would install on this server, each would end with a "Not 
enough memory to install" right when beginning the installation. When I told 
the installer to do "linux mem=1024M" the install would progress a bit further 
before giving a kernel panic about being unable to mount the root filesystem.
I'm tempted to go back and try the above mentioned append to see if that will 
make one of the newer relesases install.
Thanks to all for the help.
