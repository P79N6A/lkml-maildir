A mount option for procfs would be changable at remount, making
implementation a bit more involved.

SUID root processes will we visible for all, too.  That's fair enough, I
think.  If it's a concern to you use proc.privacy=2.

Strictly speaking, yes, but it's just a trivial cleanup near my own
change.  And I guarantee it has zero impact on any built kernel image. :]

I suppose you could do that, but I don't see any gain.  I also find my
version easier to read because it keeps the two conditionals (having
different intents and purposes) apart.

I'd rather let the compiler do that job.  It's only a small macro, I
really doubt you would measure any speedup from putting it into a local
variable.

You're right and it's a matter of taste, I guess.  By the way, this is
also what the FreeBSD crowd calls a "bikeshed". :-)
Thanks for reviewing my patch!
