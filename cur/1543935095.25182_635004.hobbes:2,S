I'm not seeing those in my inbox. I don't go out trolling for patches, 
because I expect that if the author of the patch really wants me to apply 
it, he'd send it upstream.
But I know a number of people are on vacation, and I suspect some of these 
fixes are just queued up, waiting for that.  E.g. I think Jeff is supposed 
to be back this week, etc..
