how hard would it be to make the few parameters just be module
options... and then fail module load if the test fails or something?
(and spew loudly in dmesg :)
I'd be all in favor of having such a module in the kernel; in fact it
would be nice if we roughly could standardize on an way to load/start
and then find the result, I'd love to have a "make runtests" or
something that would load such modules one by one
(and no that's not the task of ltp, ltp should test userspace; things
that test in kernel code should really be part of the kernel)
