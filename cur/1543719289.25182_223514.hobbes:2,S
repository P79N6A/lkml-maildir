Not in any useful way.  If I go look at the file history, which is what
I'm going to do when tracking down a bug, all I see on the files included

That means any annotated listing (BK or CVS blame) shows the wrong author.

  The following obviously correct patch from Christian Meder simplifies the
  DELTA() define.
