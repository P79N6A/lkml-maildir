As it is, for some large %age of users (say 99% ?), those 6 qla drivers
show up in the config menu when they aren't needed or wanted.
They get in the way.

You want it to always be presented (if PCI && SCSI) ?
No, it should be a selectable option iff PCI && SCSI.

It already does.  The problem is that is defaults to the value of
(SCSI && PCI) when a large number of people don't need that
default value.  IOW, it's a bad choice for a default value.
