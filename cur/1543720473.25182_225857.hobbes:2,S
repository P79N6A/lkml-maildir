It took some time for me to work, but now ACPI S3 (suspend to RAM) is
finally working for me (I have been trying it since 2.4.22 with no
luck). Only one thing is required before suspending:
# modprobe ds
# cardctl eject
This ejects my CardBus NIC before going to sleep. Not doing so, causes
the system to freeze when resuming.
