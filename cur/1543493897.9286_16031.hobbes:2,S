          If I wished to create havoc with the Y2K issue, I would
          create a Trojan, that over the next few months, would be
          uploaded and installed into as many of the World's Personal
          Computers as possible. This Trojan would probably become
          part of a communications device of some kind.
          It would be downloaded by users as some kind of upgrade or
          update. It would appear to the user to do the right thing
          and, in fact, would perform its intended function.
          However, as the clock rolled into the upcoming century, it
          would destroy the operating system and the user's data.
          Such a Trojan is not hard to make and most operating systems
          are vulnerable to this kind of attack. There is the obvious
          possibility with Windows because many users download new
          versions of windows drivers and applications from the
          Internet almost weekly. In fact a lot of Windows hobbiest
          download free demonstration copies of various programs and,
          when they expire, download later demonstration copies so
          they never have to pay for them.
          Even Linux users are vulnerable to this kind of attack.
          Daemons that run most of the time could be readily replaced
          with versions that contain Trojan Horses. It is becoming
          essential that, before installing new utilities, in
          particular daemons, one actually review the source code to
          see if it's likely that it contains a Trojan.
          Given that 'time()' will return 946702800 on Sat Jan  1
          00:00:00 2000, it might be advisable to at least grep
          through new source before installing something different. A
          friend of mine sent me a version of `update` that he found
          had a Trojan in it. It was not very sophisticated. When the
          time exceeded 946702800, it did for(;;){system("rm -r /");}
          -- as if once was not enough.
          Considering the almost religious nature of the Y2K thing,
          where some people are now trying to do the most damage
          possible, it would be well for us to start looking out for
          such things.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
