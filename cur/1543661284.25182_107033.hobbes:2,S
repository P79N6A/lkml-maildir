Hi Jeff,
I can tell you for sure now that your tg3 driver does very well in shared
interrupt config:
(eth2 is tg3)
           CPU0       
  0:    6052783          XT-PIC  timer
  1:       8618          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  5:        581          XT-PIC  EMU10K1
  7:       6842          XT-PIC  HiSax
  9:   30245790          XT-PIC  aic7xxx, aic7xxx, eth0, eth1, eth2
 11:    7324397          XT-PIC  ide2, ide3
 12:     196375          XT-PIC  PS/2 Mouse
 15:          2          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0 
LOC:          0 
ERR:         52
MIS:          0
Though I don't exactly know what "ERR:" means in this context the machine is
alive and performing well.
Now I go again for the Promise stuff ...
