i'm in the process of writing a driver for the emulex lp6000 card, and have
a quick question about mdelay - specifically, is it safe to call mdelay for
a sigifigant time (ie, 0.25 to 1 second) if you haven't disabled
interrupts?  ie, will you completely monopolize the cpu, or will the
scheduler kick you off until sometime shortly after the delay runs out?

I have just had eighteen whiskeys in a row.  I do believe that is a record.
