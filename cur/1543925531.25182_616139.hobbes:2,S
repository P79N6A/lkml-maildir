Glad you asked. Today, when I want to recompile a kernel while
changing a CONFIG_ option, I manually edit the .config,
remove the appropriate line and then run make oldconfig.
I'd like to be able to do: make oldconfig CONFIG_FOO=bar.
Also, when working on a specific feature of the kernel, I tend to
install both a kernel with the CONFIG_ option set and one with
the option unset. Scripts to do that can twiddle the .config file,
but it would be more convenient if kbuild could avoid that.
As you see, I'm more interested in make oldconfig than
make all*config.
Cheers.
