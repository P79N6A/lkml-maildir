I was answering Dave's "very specialist piece of equipment" opinion.
And my point was that even in this case it's better for the user to have 
the source.

There are many bug reports to linux-kernel that are undebuggable because 
they involve the nvidia binary-only module.
I do personally know several people who use the nvidia binary-only 
modules and have as a result experienced stability problems on their 
computer. Linux has an IMHO justified reputation for being stable.
Users experiencing system stability problems due to binary-only modules 
might wrongfully attribute them to Linux harming the reputation of 
Linux.
