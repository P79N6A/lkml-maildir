Ok, thanks.  My mistake.

Are there docs on this?

I'm not wondering if > 2GB is supported.  I'm trying to get 2GB
to work (and I'm having a problem -- perhaps because I believe
Documentation/memory.txt doesn't cover the issues I'm facing).
I've not yet bothered with highmem, but I will if building a 64 bit
kernel doesn't get me access to 2GB.
Does that answer your question?
