I've taken mainline git tree (freshly integrated CFS!) out for a
multimedia spin.  I tested watching movies and listenign to music in the
presence of various sleep/burn loads, pure burn loads, and mixed loads.
All was peachy here.. I saw no frame drops or sound skips or other
artifacts under any load where the processor could possibly meet demand.
