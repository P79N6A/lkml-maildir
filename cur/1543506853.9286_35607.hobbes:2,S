I just tried to access a floppy disk that I had just mounted, and
the disk drive came on for an unreasonable amount of time (20
seconds or so).  Midnight commander seemed to hang, and then I
did a dir on the mountpoint and the drive light went out.  I got
the dir listing, and immediately pppd died.
I examined syslog and found:
Aug 24 06:16:52 asdf kernel: inserting floppy driver for 2.2.11
Aug 24 06:16:52 asdf kernel: Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M

Aug 24 06:22:47 asdf pppd[7262]: Exit.
Could this be a kernel bug, or mere coincidence?
