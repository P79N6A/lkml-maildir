So change it. I'd rather have an empty /proc/pid/maps than have the 
general code have #ifdef's.
Or make /proc more dynamic, although I don't think it's necessarily worth
it unless it would be part of a generic dentry'ification (the devfs work 
is all well and good, but /proc has been around even longer).
