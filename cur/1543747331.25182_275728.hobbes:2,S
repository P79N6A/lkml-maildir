Right.  Which brings us to my second bullet.  I *knew* I should have
made it the first :-/

Looks like you missed the post that started this thread.  It *did*
mention machine-independent and machine-specific user headers.

As I pointed out, `user' is a very bad name.  As you said yourself,
we're talking about the *kernel* ABI.  So what's `user' supposed to
mean?  Was I so successful in my arguments that you now see it as the
userland ABI? :-)

You mean it can't break anything in a kernel build, or it can't break
anything except for userland apps that abused kernel headers and used
to get away with that?

People who currently get to maintain duplicates of these header
contents will take immediate advantage of these changes, since they
will no longer have to maintain the duplicates.  This is a major step
forward in terms of maintainability for everybody else, at no expense
to the kernel, that now gets to explicitly (as opposed to implicitly)
document what is the ABI it's willing to comply with.  It's a win for
both ends.
