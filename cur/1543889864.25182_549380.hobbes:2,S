You are absolutely right, we have been stalled on EVM/IMA/SLIM, while 
trying
to figure out the mtime and revocation issues. In retrospect we tried to 
submit
too much complex code all at once. 
We will resubmit in small functional pieces as the technical issues have 
been
resolved, starting with the LIM API and hooks, which are independent of 
the 
mtime and revocation issues.
