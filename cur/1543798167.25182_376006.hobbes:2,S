I don't see how this can ever work.
How can _userspace_ know about what allocations are critical to the
kernel?!
And as you noticed, it does not work for your original usage case,
because reserved memory pool would have to be "sum of all network
interface bandwidths * ammount of time expected to survive without
network" which is way too much.
If you want few emergency pages for some strange hack you are doing
(swapping over network?), just put swap into ramdisk and swapon() it
when you are in emergency, or use memory hotplug and plug few more
gigabytes into your machine. But don't go introducing infrastructure
that _can't_ be used right.
