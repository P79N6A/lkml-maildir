I don't know if this is the solution to your problem, but /usr/src/linux/README.SUSE
says
  (3)  Compile the module(s) by changing into the module source directory
       and typing ``make -C /usr/src/linux
          O=/usr/src/linux-obj/$ARCH/$FLAVOR M=`pwd` modules''.
          Substitute $ARCH and $FLAVOR with the architecture and flavor
          for which to build the module(s).
I hope this helps,
Duncan.
