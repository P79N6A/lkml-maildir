ICH2 is marked '80821BA' and is rated ATA/100 by intel, PIIX4 is '82371AB'
so you can look on your motherboard.  Andre is the one to say if the driver
is compatible.  I can't find a single reference to the 80821 in
drivers/block/*.c for 2.2.19pre17 + ide.2.2.18.1221.
Here's what a PIIX4 looks like.
