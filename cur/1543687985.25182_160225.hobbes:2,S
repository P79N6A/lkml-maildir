Sorry, I have to postpone this investigation. No time on the machine.
I try to describe the behaviour of rxvt as best as I can below.
Afaics, the application (rxvt) just sleeps at the beginning waiting for
input from X. As every terminal would do. At some point its inferior
process finishes, but it fails to notice this spinning madly in the
internal loop calling select, which returns immediately (because other
side of pty was closed. That is the error in rxvt). Probably it has
accumulated enough "priority" up to this moment to block other
applications (window manager, for example) when it suddenly starts running?
