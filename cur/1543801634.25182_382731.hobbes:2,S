Indeed.  I updated the BIOS to the latest available, and it doesn't
list the IPMI controller in the ACPI namespace.  FWIW, this is
effectively an Intel S870BN4 "Tiger4" system.  FWIW2, the Dell
PowerEdge x8xx line (current shipping EM64T servers) doesn't have the
IPMI controller in the ACPI namespace either.
I reworked the patch, such that on EFI-capable systems, it uses
efi.smbios to find the _DMI_ table header, and on all non-EFI systems,
continues the brute force search from 0xF0000 as before.
Thanks,
Matt
