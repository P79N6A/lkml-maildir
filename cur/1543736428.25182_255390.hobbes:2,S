I thought I heard you asking for CPUTIME returning the actual cputime
used in the last message. I have proposed falling back to realtime in the
past but that was not acceptable.

Yes and glibc will have to get through contortions to
simulate a clock that returns the actual cpu time used. Why not cleanly
do the clock_gettime syscall without doing any redirection of clocks?
Any implementation of the CPUTIME clocks is always easier to do in the
kernel with just a few lines.

Ok, I will dig out my old patch and repost it to glibc-alpha.
