Well, with crrent versions you have to have 2 or 3 of them to realy make a
server trtash. Something like:
tail /dev/zero 
recovers with the oom killer
tail /dev/zero & tail /dev/zero & tail /dev/zero
will most likely trash for minutes.
Some kind of penalty could be introduced, because this is better to set up
than ulimit. On a system with large amounts of users you simply cant set the
ulimit of a single user to mainram/concurrent-users or
mainram/concurrent-evil-users.
