I'm having a problem with 2.6 (many versions), and my Via Epia M10000
not rebooting correctly. 2.4 works fine. The problem is after the
computer restarts, and the pxe stuff from the bios tries to do it's
thing, it fails. I get the following error:
PXE_M0F: Exiting Intel PXE ROM.
Then the bios tries to fallback to other means of booting, and there
are none. Anybody got any clues where to start looking for fixes?
