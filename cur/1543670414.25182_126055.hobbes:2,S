           Summary: File locking memory leak
    Kernel Version: many
            Status: NEW
          Severity: high
             Owner: willy@debian.org
         Submitter: willy@debian.org
Problem Description:
Some people have reported to me that the file_lock_cache grows virtually
without bound.  I haven't been able to reproduce the problem yet.  I'm
filing this bug here to track the problem.
I suspect it depends on workload.  First problem will be to track down what
type of lock it is; that'll give me some clue as to which of the three
independent implementations in the file locking code is leaking locks.
Steps to reproduce:
