Same as you, I do not yet understand, but:
The rumour of unamerican char troubles in UDF implementations reached
this thread without coming from me.  From others we have, in the
subscriber-only linux_udf@h... archives:

Ok, that confirmed my guess as to what the problem is (it's a problem
with 16 bit characters vs 8 bit characters)
I'll work up a patch this weekend.

My local records tell me no patch has reached `cvs co udf` or `cvs co
udftools` at sourceforge.net/linux-udf/ since 2004-03-22.

I say "unamerican chars" to mean the printable chars that do not appear
on a US keyboard, even when lowercased.  Do you prefer some other term?
I can't be sure how literally the authority quoted above meant 16 vs. 8
bit.  For example, I fear together all of:
$'\x23' # "octothorpe"
$'\xA3' £ "pound sterling, ... Italian lira, ... etc."
$'\xA5' ¥ "YEN SIGN"
$'\xE2\x82\xAC' x20AC € "EURO SIGN"
Yet only the x20AC of these four chars is unequivocally not "8 bit".
The char names I quote I took from 
http://www.unicode.org/charts/
The arcane $'\xXX\xXX\xXX' UTF-8 notation is from `man bash` re \xHH.
