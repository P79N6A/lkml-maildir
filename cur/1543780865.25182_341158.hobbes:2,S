The only document that I have is RFC3530 (the NFSv4 spec) which doesn't
really define file leases, but does define the caching protocol that
they act as support for.
In principle it is supposed to be the same protocol that CIFS uses
(although CIFS doesn't really have much in the form of documentation
that we can use to verify that fact).
To me, the NFSv4 requirements suggest:
     open()  |  lease requested    | effect on existing leases |
      flag   | F_RDLCK  | F_WRLCK  | F_RDLCK  | F_WRLCK        |
    ---------+----------+----------+---------------------------+
    O_RDONLY | okay     |  okay    |  none    |  recall        |
    O_WRONLY | EAGAIN   |  okay    |  recall  |  recall        |
    O_RDWR   | EAGAIN   |  okay    |  recall  |  recall        |

 fcntl(SETLK)| effect on existing leases |
     flag    | F_RDLCK   | F_WRLCK       |
    ---------+---------------------------+
     F_RDLCK | none      | none          |
     F_WRLCK | recall    | none          |

Other operation that should recall leases (both types!) are
unlink(), link(), f/l/chown(), f/chmod(), rename(), setfacl().
truncate() and utime() calls by another process.
-----
Finally, operations that should recall read leases only:
truncate() and utime() calls by your process.
