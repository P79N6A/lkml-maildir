My kernels here (i686, egcs snapshots, binutils latest version) show an
unholy appetite for ext2 filesystems (starting around 2.3.16 or so, it
seems; acute with 2.3.18ac, much less so with 2.3.20. Later kernels just
don't complete bootstrapping the system, various Oopsen and hangs).
Symptoms include corrupt files, duplicate blocks with what seem to be
deleted files, all kind of weird devices with strange permissions, often
undeletable, showing up in lost+found.
2.2.13 built with egcs-19991004, binutils-2.9.5.0.16, modutils-2.3.6
crashes on boot (a lot of Oopsen, and finally a hang). Also eats
filesystems, it seems. Not yet tried gcc-2.95.1.
Caveat constructor.

Caveat le Fan. Horst, I've built all those kernels with the current
binutils when they were released (now ...16) and gcc-2.95.1. Your
problem is almost certainly hardware. Winter is coming on here, so I
presume summer is heating up there. Teach you i686 to pant.
