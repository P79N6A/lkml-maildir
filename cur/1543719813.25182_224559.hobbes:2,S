Well, multiple recursion around the same function seems to be solvable two 
different ways:
 - "don't do that then". It really seems broken, but maybe there are 
   really really good reasons _why_ it's not broken and why it happens.
 - make sure that the separate loops are broken in some _other_ place than 
   in the function they share.
A combination of the two may work well.
I say "may", because maybe I'm wrong, and the condition is common and hard
to avoid limiting in the shared function. I don't have your data (and I'm
lazy, so quite frankly I'd much rather you do the analysis anyway ;).
That said, I just don't see any sane alternatives to my "break in one
place" thing. I believe that anything more complex that tries to explain
the whole loop is just going to be a nightmare to maintain, and fragile as
hell except for totally static legacy code that nobody touches any more.
