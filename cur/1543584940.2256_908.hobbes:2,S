Crashes were routine, and I was not overclocking, so I took Mike's
advice and bought a new 256MB DIMM. The computer hasn't crashed
once since I installed it. Now, though, I have a curious though
fairly irrelevant problem. My kernel apparently sees less RAM than
I have.

I strongly doubt this can be a bug in the kernel. Could anyone
explain to me why this might happen?
