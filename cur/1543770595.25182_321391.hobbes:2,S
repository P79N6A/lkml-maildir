Subject: i2c-parport disappeared from 2.6.11.9

Hello
Drivers -> I2C -> Busses -> Parallel port adapter disappeared in
2.6.11.9. However the source drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-parport.c
and i2c-parport.h are still there.
There is only parallel port light (i2c-parport-light.c) in the make
menuconfig menu.
I am working on a driver in i2c-parport.c. What should I do? Stop the
work and forget it? Or continue?
I took care to turn on "Prompt for development and/or incomplete
code/drivers" and turn off "Select only drivers expected to compile
cleanly".
