Every time we proceed through proc_pid_cmdline with mm->arg_end == 0 is a
bug. AFAICT anyway. Whether you see an "occurence of the bug" depends on
how you measure it. Of course you are wecome to add more printks following
the code path to see how and when it propagates to where you are catching
it.
