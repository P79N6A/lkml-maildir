Subject: [Patch 3/4] Move the base kernel to 2Mb to align with TLB boundaries
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/27/159

As suggested by Andi (and Alan), move the default kernel location
from 1Mb to 2Mb, to align to the start of a TLB entry.
