Hello linux-kernel,
patch-2.4.21 contains the following patch to keyboard.c:

                /* we do not return yet, because we want to maintain

But apparently, there is not only hardware that sends the key release
event twice, but also hardware that sends the key press event twice 
in certain circumstances.
I've got a keyboard ("Unikey model KWD-205"), which, for the left
control key (and apparently only for this key) sends the key down
event twice, followed by two key up events. For certain applications 
using VC_RAW (most important XFree86), this means that the ctrl
key gets "stuck" once it's been pressed.
I don't know an "appropriate" fix to this problem. Obviously, the
patch got inserted in 2.4.21 because it fixes broken keyboards
owned by many people. As I didn't find any reports about my
problem with google, it seems that keyboards like my one are
quite rare. One possible solution would be to ignore any events
where next_scancode==prev_scancode, regardless of up_flag - but
this breaks autorepeat, which then would maybe need to be
emulated.
Another possible fix would be to only ignore multiple identical
"up" events for non-modifier keys, but this would require
keyboard.c to have a list of key symbols of keys like "control",
"shift" etc.
So, are there other people having the same problem? Is it worth
to find a "good" fix for the linux kernel, or should I just
remove this patch by hand every time I compile a new kernel,
until my keyboard dies and I get a non-broken one? ;-)
