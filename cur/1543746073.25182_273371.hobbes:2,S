Yes, I know all this, and I warned before that this tests were strictly
and specific to the hardware, jackd and fludisynth code which are
intentionally kept the same along the several RT kernels that have been
issued.
Note that I've kept this consistency to my self, and applies /only/ to my
laptop, where the tests are being evaluated. Again, this test-suite of
mine has the sole intention to compare the jackd workload performance
across kernels, in an almost real softsynth scenario. All kernels tested
are built with no debug options, ressembling production ones as far as
possible.
For example, these are the results-du-jour, which serves as a straight
comparison RT-V0.7.30-2, with the previous posted ones from RT-V0.7.7:
                                  RT-V0.7.7 RT-V0.7.30-2
                                  --------- ------------

  Delay Rate (>1000 usecs)  . . :      3.6         29.3  /hour

  Average Context-Switch Rate . :  13940.9      14894.7  /sec
The only thing that has changed here was the kernel image, as everything
else has remained constant.

So true.

Of course, and the "reference" driver used on my tests is no exception
(snd-ali5451). But again, it's been kept the same on all tests, and the
improvement along the progression of the RT kernel development has been
outstanding nevertheless.
Cheers.
