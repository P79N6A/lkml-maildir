Hi,
Is there a way to use sk_buff to get all the incoming and outgoing 
packets from the ethernet layer.  i.e. from the eth.c etc.  I'm interested in getting
info. about the packet headers and also  some other kernel variables.   Specifically the src address, dest.addr, portnos etc. from the kernel itself.    I thought that sk_buff->data would be storing these headers and the data also, but when I try to print it out, it just prints garbage values.
Is it possible to do it this way.
Any suggestions would be helpful,
Sincerely,
Aamir
