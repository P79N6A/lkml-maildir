Ingo has determined that Linus's backboost trick is causing at least some
of these problems. Please test and report upon the below patch.
I have another workload which is showing starvation with or without this
patch - it is the bitkeeper verification step in a `bk clone' on a
uniprocessor kernel.  Still poking at that one.
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
the patch below fixes George's setiathome problems (as expected).  It
essentially turns off Linus' improvement, but i dont think it can be fixed
sanely.
the problem with setiathome is that it displays something every now and
then - so it gets a backboost from X, and hovers at a relatively high
priority.
