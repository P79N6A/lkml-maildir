I would agree, except that this doesn't put any onus on the submitters
to get their patches in early, and causes the thundering heard of
patches problem the same way that not announcing the patch deadline does.
Note that "accepted" may be a bad term on my part - I can't say if this
means that the patch has been recieved by Linus, or whether it actually
has to be in the kernel tree at that date.
Note that I wasn't at the kernel summit myself, hence this is all just
what I have heard from others.
Cheers, Andreas
