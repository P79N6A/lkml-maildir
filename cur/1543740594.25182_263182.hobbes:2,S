Wrong. Companies *have* tried to go down the Open Source route and it did 
not work out for them. ATI in particular. At one point ATI released all 
the register level information and in fact released sample 3D driver 
source code to the community for the early Radeon chipsets. Unfortunately 
the Linux and Open Source community never stepped up to the plate to 
support ATI in this effort. There are solid business reasons that ATI has 
explained to me for why ATI decided to give up on the Open Source 
approach and go back to proprietary 3D drivers for Linux. 
For 2D they continue to maintain XFree86/X.org drivers with full source 
code for the community, just not 3D.
If someone wishes to go down this route, more power to them. But I don't 
think it is a viable way to make money for a business. The biggest 
problem is that even if every active Linux or Open Source kernel 
developer decided to buy one of these cards, that is a pretty small 
market. The unfortunate fact I have come to realise is that there is a 
very large contingent of Linux end users out there who just want free 
stuff. Free as in free beer. They could care less whether the source code 
is available as long as they don't pay for it. Those same users are also 
more than happy to install ATI or NVIDIA proprietary kernel modules and 
taint their kernel so they can get 3D support when running Linux and 
still run their favorite games at full speed under Windows. Those same 
users probably won't pay a premium to get a 3D card that is slower than 
an ATI or NVIDIA just because it has source code for the drivers.
Sad but true IMHO.
