Sure. _notify is happening inside the pt lock by coincidence, to
reduce the changes to mm/* as long as the mmu notifiers aren't

No trouble, it's just that I didn't want to mangle over the logic of
do_wp_page unless it was strictly required, the patch has to be
obviously safe. You need to keep that bit of your patch to make the
mmu notifiers sleepable.
