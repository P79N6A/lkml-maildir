The major thing that you are missing is that this "one model" has  
been very heavily tested over the years.  People understand it, know  
how to use it and write software for it, and grok its limitations.   
There's also a vast amount of *existing* code that you can't just  
"deprecate" overnight; the world just doesn't work that way.  The  
real way to get there (IE: a new model) from here (IE: the old model)  
is the way all Linux development is done with a lot of sensible easy- 
to-understand changes and refactorings.
With that said, if you actually want to sit down and start writing  
*code* for your model, go ahead.  If it turns out to be better than  
our existing model then I owe you a bottle of your favorite beverage.
Cheers,
