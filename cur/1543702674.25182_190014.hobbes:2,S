top (from procps-3.1.14 at least) only reads
the /proc/*/statm files when you activate
columns that need the statm data. Those are:
%MEM   Memory usage (RES) 
VIRT   Virtual Image (kb) 
SWAP   Swapped size (kb) 
RES    Resident size (kb) 
CODE   Code size (kb) 
DATA   Data+Stack size (kb) 
SHR    Shared Mem size (kb)
nDRT   Dirty Pages count 
By default, some of those get displayed.
The default includes: VIRT RES SHR %MEM
To get rid of those, type this:
   f  o  q  t  n  enter  W
(the "W" writes out a config file)
In case your top is too old for this, you
can go to 
http://procps.sf.net/
 for a new one.
