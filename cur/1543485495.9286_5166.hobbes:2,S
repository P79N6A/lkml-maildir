No, it doesn't. The kernel still only reports two interrupts on that line, 
because I've loaded the driver twice. The user-space programs which load the 
firmware into the card are just sitting there doing nothing.

I've now read setup.S, and can see where the PICs are reprogrammed to map 
IRQ0-15 onto int 0x20-0x2f. So how does the PIC generate the correct INT? 
Surely the CPU doesn't have that many external pins?
