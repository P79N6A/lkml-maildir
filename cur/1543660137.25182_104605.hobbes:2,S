Everybody wants it _if_ everybody can control it. And all that stuff 
is not made to be controlled by the (home-)user but by the OS-vendor, 
the ISP and probably all that nice 3-letter-govermental organizations 
found in all countries around the world.

If you can guarantee that _I_ can control it all the time on my PCs I 
might consider to accept it.
Apart from that I have military-grade security on my PC - just 
install openssl and you have it too.
