the problem is that it _can_ arise, and fixing that is an huge mess
without using the pte_chains IMHO (no hope to use the vma->shared).
I also don't see how can you know if a vma is pointing all to "direct"
pages and in turn you can move it somewhere else without the pte_chains.
sure you can move all anon vmas freely after an execve, but after the
first fork (and in turn with cow pages going on) all mremaps will
non-trackable with anonmm, right? lots of server processes uses fork()
model for the childs, and they can run mremap inside the child of memory
malloced inside the child, and I don't think you can easily track if the
malloc happened inside the child or inside the father, though I may be
wrong on this.
