Can you please try 2.6.10-rc2-mm2 + the patch I posted yesterday night ?
It will still kill RNAsubopt, but it should not longer touch the xterm,
which runs vmstat.

One good reason might be that in the out of memory situation the system
has no idea, whether the requester will gracefully shutdown when
recieving ENOMEM or keep trying to get some more memory. 
The decision to return ENOMEM or finally calling the oom-killer depends
on the flags for this allocation request. The criteria are __GFP_FS set
and not __GFP_NORETRY set.
So all allocations GFP_KERNEL, GFP_USER and GFP_HIGHUSER are candidates
to end up in the oom_killer. The only caller which ever sets the
__GFP_NORETRY flag is fs/xfs.
