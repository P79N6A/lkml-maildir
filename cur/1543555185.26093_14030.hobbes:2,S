So it's yet another "borken hardware"... Is there anything like
SCSI "blacklist" for IDE driver? Then it could be handled easily
by registering the drive there and check that out before autodetection.

Oh, no. Thanks for catching that. It should obviously be 0x0400.
# I guess it got converted in a way like this: 10th bit -> 10 -> 0x0a. Ugh.

Now that explains one missing sector reported previously. Yes,
ATA spec says that the command returns "maximum address", not
number of sectors.
I'll make a fix and resend a patch - or since the fix is so
simple, I guess Andre can just add these fixes to IDE driver directly.
