That didn't come out right, but what I meant to say was this:  Since the 
headers in include/linux are quite broken with respect to GLIBC and 
userspace, I won't let so-called "compatibility" code like this get in 
the way:
  #ifndef __GNUC__
  #define DO_SOMETHING(foo) ICKY_MACRO
  #else
  static __inline__ void DO_SOMETHING(int foo)
  {
  	sensible_inline_function();
  }
  #endif
You can see where I take that approach in the patches I sent.
One other thing I would like to point out:  The fd_set code wants to use
__set_bit and __clear_bit from <linux/bitops.h>, but those really should
not be accessible to userspace directly.  I would like to propose moving
that functionality into <__klib/*.h> from which it would be accessible
to both <linux/*.h> and <kabi/*.h>.  I think this would also help with 
the UML header issues by providing those kernel-internal APIs to the 
kernel when run from userspace. (Please correct me if I'm wrong).
I appreciate your comments and corrections, thanks!
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
