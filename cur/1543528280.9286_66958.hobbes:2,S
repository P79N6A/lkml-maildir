I had a isdn-related crash too, it went like this:
# rmmod isdn hisax
<error message because isdn is "in use" by hisax>
# rmmod isdn hisax
<freeze - no sysrq or anything>
I tried to unload modules in the wrong order.  That is usually not a
problem - one gets an error message for the first and then the
second unloads.  So I repeated the command, expecting
isdn to unload and an error message for the non-existant hisax.
But I got a crash instead.
This was an attempt to see how devfsd treats isdn devices - I can't
get it to make "compatibility symlinks" like it does for anything else.
Making isdn use the new system would be even better, but changing
all config files from /dev/isdnsomething to /dev/isdn/isdnsomething
didn't
do the trick.
