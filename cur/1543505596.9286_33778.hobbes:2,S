Not gcc 2.95 per se.  RedHat 6.0's "gcc" softlink comes from the 
egcs-1.1.2-12 RPM; Mandrake 6.0's "gcc" link comes from the 
pgcc-1.1.3-3mdk RPM.  IIRRC, gcc 2.95 has egcs 1.1.2 merged in (but I 
am not sure what, if anything, gcc 2.95 has done regarding pgcc).
Also, you wrote earlier (about my successful installation under Mandrake)
>Perchance without vmware ?
The answer is that 2.2.11 under Mandrake works both with and without vmware.
I'm now deciding between trying to compile under different versions 
of gcc, or (following Mike Galbraith's suggestion) using ikd and 
enabling memleak.  I'm open to advice regarding the pain/benefit 
ratio of either course.
