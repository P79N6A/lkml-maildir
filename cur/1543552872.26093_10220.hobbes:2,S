I understand you are in charge of this per MAINTAINERS, it not, I
apologize for bothering you.
Red Hat 7, i686, gcc-20001027 (from CVS) complains about '??)' trigraphs at
lines 1278 and 6367. Should that be just '(?)', or perhaps 'xx'? (egcs-1.1.2
keeps quiet).
[Yes, trigraphs are bletcherous. Perhaps disable the warning for good in
 Makefile:
 HOSTCFLAGS      = -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
]
Thanks!
