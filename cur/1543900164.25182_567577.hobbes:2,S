I guess that dump filtering will needed to be tested at least once 
under various platforms for every major release of the kernel to see 
if the information exported by the kernel through this elf note is 
still sufficient. 
Adding more info to this elf note as needed can be done through a simple 
patch to the kernel and it can be tested along with mkdumpfile changes 
even before a major version gets released.
More things to consider:
 * Elf note size is currently limited to 1024, we might need a bit more
   (currently this elf note is in the 900-area).
 * If we move the generation of the elf note to the boot time instead 
   of crash time as you suggested, we can also make it viewable as a 
   virtual file.
 * We should come up with a standard name for the note (LINUX, or 
   LINUX-VMCORE, etc).

Agreed.
Actually, having a UTS_RELEASE note attached to vmlinux itself is quite 
easy to implement. All we need is some .s file in the kernel doing 
something similar to this (inspired by some post made by Ulrich Drepper):
#include <linux/utsrelease.h>
	.section ".note.UTS_RELEASE", "a"
	.align 4
	.long 1f - 0f		/* name length */
	.long 3f - 2f		/* data length */
	.long  1		/* note type */
0:	.asciz "UTS_RELEASE"	/* uts release */
1:	.align 4	
2:	.asciz UTS_RELEASE     	/* note data */
3:	.align 4		/* pad out section */

Agreed.

'debuginfo' can be confused with the more standard DWARF debuginfo. 
How about vmcoreinfo, dumpinfo, debugaux, debugauxinfo, or 
dumpauxinfo?
