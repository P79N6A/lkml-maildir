No, thats actually the fix - Note that the original code only tried to
set the state on device 0x100, and then 0x1FF, and I added 0x101 to the
mix too. I just figured that while I was in there, I would re-do the
code to avoid a tiny if-then-else mess.

Thats just prevents the error message from printing out twice.
I can't remember if it really fixed a problem with our BIOS returning
APM_NOT_ENGAGED when the READY state was set, but it still seems like
a good idea.
