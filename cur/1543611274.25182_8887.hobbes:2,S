hi all.
i hope this question is not too stupid,
but i think i've grepped all through it now.
i see the prototype in linux/pci.h
i looked at i386/kernel/pci-pc.c.
i see the bios/direct access diversion. i don't see (*pci_config_read)()
referenced elsewhere except within the acpi stuff.
i looked at drivers/pci/*
i even consulted lxr. nyet. nada.
giving up now. any hint would be greatly appreciated. am i blind?
thanx,
dns
