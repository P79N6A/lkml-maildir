By SLAB I always mean allocator which is used to get the memory.
In your design main allocator is used to reserve the memory, which then
can be used by your own allocator.

Just never return reserved pages, provide kernel parameter of how large
your reserve is and get pages from there when you detected OOM.
SLAB (main allocator) can do anything it want, but your reserve will never 
be touched by it.
