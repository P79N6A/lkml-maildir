Hello,
    Since it takes quite a it of time for me to deal with news groups, could
someone please point me to a _LINUX_ news group that could help me with
password sync between Unix and Windows.  I am using Microsofts password sync
tool that comes with SFU 1.2.  I know I sould ask Micr$loth, but I have been
for two mounths and thay refuse to help me.  I get ignored in the Micro$loth
list, and I have a deadline.  Besides, I have found that most linux hackers
know more about Micro$loth then the _GOOD_ people at Micro$sloth.
Thanks, and sorry for any disturbance!
