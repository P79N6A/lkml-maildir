The only useful thing with enfore_max() is that cpu_possible_map is trimmed
so some resource allocations that use for_each_cpu() for upfront allocation
wont allocate resources.
Currently i see max_cpus only limiting boot-time start, none trim cpu_possible
which is done in only x86_64. max_cpu is still honored, just that for initial
boot. I would think maybe remove enforce_max_cpus() altogether like other 
archs instead of adding one more just for x86_64. 
Maybe we should add only if there is a need, instead of adding and finding
no-one using it and finally removing it very soon.
