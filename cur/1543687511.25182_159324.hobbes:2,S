Although I agree with your "too verbose" sentiment above, I think the 
removing the messages outright might not serve the best interests the 
developer.  Since even KERN_DEBUG still spams dmesg, in these situations 
I usually change these type of messages to be conditionally printed iff 
a debug macro is enabled.
As a tangent, the huge x86 IO-APIC verbosity really bugs me, too, and 
often is the direct cause of useful early printk messages being lost 
before boot is even complete.
