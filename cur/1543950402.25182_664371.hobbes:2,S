AFAIK there were basically two series of deathstars. The original
DTLA<something> and the more recent IC35<something>. The IC35 series
were bigger (120GB is the most common size I've seen for those).
Proper cooling and firmware upgrade usually fixed the deathstarness on
both series. I still have some of both, not in active use for a year or
two but still working. As a strange coincidence I was just pulling out
some old data from them yesterday.
