I am not sure if these two sections are suitable in this howto.  It
seems pretty ambitious, since they can get very large and the
books/resources sections can take care of this.  The book "Linux
Device Drivers" by Rubini and Corbet has got a section on source tour.

Kernel Debugging can probably go ahead of the "How do I...?" section,
since in practice you probably need some variant of the the setup you
have described before you start, unless you are just trying out a
trivial module.
In fact, if the concepts section is not there, the whole document
seems to have the structure of how to do something, with sub sections
of varying length (after all, it is hacking HOWTO).
