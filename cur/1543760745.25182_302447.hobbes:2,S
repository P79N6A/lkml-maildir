It's a binutils version issue. Older binutils didn't
require the '*', while newer ones print a warning when
it's missing. Adding the missing '*'s breaks old binutils,
which isn't considered acceptable in the stable 2.4 series.
So just live with the warnings, or apply personal patches
to silence them (like I've been doing for ages).
