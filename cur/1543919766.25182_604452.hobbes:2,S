No messages to /var/log/messages as a result of those
commands; I ran several times and did a sync too, just
in case.
I very much doubt that something is regularly accessing
the drives because I have a script that runs every 1/2 hour
to check and log status. The drives stay "standby" for
hours (even days) at a time unless I specifically access
something on the RAID array. Then, they stay "active/idle"
until I manually set them to "standby".
Anything else you'd like me to try?
