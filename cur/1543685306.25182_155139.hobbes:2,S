Yeah, that option does break almost all current usages of __devinit* in
pci drivers today with CONFIG_HOTPLUG disabled :(
So either making it a different config option, or just dropping
__devinit* all together is fine with me, one of them needs to happen.
Any preferences from anyone else?

If we drop __devinit* then having CONFIG_HOTPLUG as a config option is
almost pointless as it doesn't really affect much code at all.  Any
objections to just always enabling it?
Anyone want to make up any before and after memory usages with
CONFIG_HOTPLUG enabled and disabled to see if it's really as small as
I'm thinking it is?  
Do the embedded people care?  :)
thanks,
