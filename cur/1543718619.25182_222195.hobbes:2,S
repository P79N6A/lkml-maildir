Could be that you have the i2c-i810 driver loaded. Both drivers (i2c and
fb) request the PCI device AFAIK, so they are mutually exclusive.
Both drivers should proably be merged so as to solve that issue, but
nodoby seems to be interested in working on this right now. And I won't
do it, I don't even have compatible hardware to test on.
Just my two cents, hope it helps.
