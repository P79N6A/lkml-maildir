It's already done by my statistic tool by following merge code:
	CONV_PER_ITEM("<pavel@ucw.cz>",
			"<pavel@suse.cz>", "Novell"),
	CONV_PER_ITEM("<pavel@pavel@suse.cz>",
			"<pavel@suse.cz>", "Novell"),
	CONV_PER_ITEM("<pavel@suse.de>",
			"<pavel@suse.cz>", "Novell"),
	CONV_PER_ITEM("<pavel@suze.cz>",
			"<pavel@suse.cz>", "Novell"),
