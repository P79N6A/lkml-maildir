Actually there is a very practical reason we don't need to preserve device
names across a migration event between machines, is the only sane thing
to do is to generate a hotplug event that says you have removed the old
interface and added a new interface.
My expectation is that during migration you will wind up with add and
remove events for all of your hardware devices.  But most applications
because they do not access hardware devices directly will not care.
I haven't looked closely but I suspect this is one area where a container
style approach will be noticeably different from a Xen or Vmware style
approach.
