   [netdrvr pcnet32] add missing pci_dma_sync_single
   
   a patch for the pcnet32.c driver which adds a missing call to
   pci_dma_sync_single.  If a received packet is smaller than rx_copybreak
   the pcnet driver will recycle the receive buffer which requires calling
   pci_dma_sync_single.  Patch is against 2.6 but I it's also needed in 2.4.
   
   Without that call the processor might still have old stale data in
   the data cache when the processor accesses the recycled buffer.
