The radeon module shouldn't require agpgart, as it is supposed
to work with pcigart for PCI versions, but for DRI to work some sort of
hardware module(s) need to be loaded.

I added the modprobe for via-agp to this line in modprobe.conf:
install radeon { /sbin/modprobe agpgart; /sbin/modprobe/via-agp; }; /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install radeon
which works well enough.  However, this line only removes the
radeon module:
remove radeon /sbin/modprobe -r --ignore-remove radeon && { /sbin/modprobe -r via-agp; /sbin/modprobe -r agpgart; /bin/true; }
Even after the radeon module is unloaded, the via-agp module
won't unload because it claims to be in use.  I have to force
unload it.  What could it be hanging on?
Thanks,
Andy Johnson
