Interesting. If you compile the legacy driver out does it then run
properly. If you've got an IDE class device legacy should not be loading
so I'll have a look at that.
The detection of the 20230 implies a bug in the Qemu IDE emulation but
it shouldn't have crashed and it shouldn't even have tried to detect it
if PCI IDE claims to be present as I believe is the case ?
