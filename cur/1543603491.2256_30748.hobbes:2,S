Ingo, is it possible to provide an interface (optional interface) to drivers,
so that they can decide how many interrupts are too much. Drivers who feel
that they should go in for interrupt mitigation have the option of deciding
to go for it.
Ofcourse, you could also have a ceiling on the maximun number of interrupts,
but the ceiling should be user configurable (using sysctl or /proc), this
would enable administrators to config their systems depending on what kind
of devices (with shared interrupts or not) they have.
Just my 2cents,
Balbir
