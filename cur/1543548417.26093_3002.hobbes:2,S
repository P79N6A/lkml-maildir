In fairness to CVS, I ran this a third time and got 78 seconds, so the net
must have been busy.  It's still about a 50:1 performance difference.
On the other hand, if you do a
    find . -type f | xargs touch
    time cvs update .
it will melt down your DSL line for what seems forever.  I killed it after
20 minutes, I have better things to do with my bandwidth.   It's pretty
clear that CVS is comparing timestamps so if your files get modified at
all, it's going to transfer them to see what needs to be updated.  The
same sort of "touch all, then update" operation in BK has no effect on
performance, BK doesn't do its work that way.
