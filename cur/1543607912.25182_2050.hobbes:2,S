Now, it's not true on _all_ PPC's.
The sane PPC setups actually have a regular soft-filled TLB, and last I
saw that actually performed _better_ than the stupid architected hash-
chains. And for the broken OS's (ie AIX) that wants the hash-chains, you
can always make the soft-fill TLB do the stupid thing..
(Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you can find code where the hash-chains are faster,
especially big Fortran programs that have basically no tear-down and
build-up overhead. Which was why those things were designed that way, of
course. But it _looks_ like at least parts of IBM may finally be wising up
to the fact that hashed TLB's are a stupid idea).
