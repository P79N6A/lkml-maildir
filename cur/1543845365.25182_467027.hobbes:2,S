well it's all a function of the task reaping logic: right now we in 
essence complete the reaping from the scheduler, via prev_state == 
TASK_DEAD. We cannot do it sooner because the task is still in use. I 
had one other implementation upstream some time ago, which was a 
single-slot cache for reaped tasks - but that uglified other codepaths 
because _something_ has to notice that the task has been unscheduled.
