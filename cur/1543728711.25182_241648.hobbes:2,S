There are 2 issues I have since 2.6.8-rc1 (2.6.7 is fine). One is that my
Tornado SFM56.0 USB modem isn't detected anymory and the other is that I
can't seem te login with SSH.
This is from a "diff -u bootmessages-2.6.7 bootmessages-2.6.8-rc1":

The SSH problem is a bit stranger. I know this is a user space application
but since 2.6.7 has no problems I thought I mention it just in case. If I
strace the daemon and compare a working with a non-working session the
non-working sessions fails on this:
open("/dev/ptmx", O_RDWR)         = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Ben
