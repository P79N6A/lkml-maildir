Hmmm. Let's see what the consequences of this decision will be:
- new tasks are placed on an idle CPU, this is always good
  (now that I think of it, new tasks are always penalized
  in goodness() -- should we consider this harmful?)
- short-slice tasks might have to wait for long-slice tasks
  (if the priority of the long-slice task is higher)
- while waiting, another short-slice task (on another CPU)
  might have chosen to reschedule, hence freeing up it's
  CPU and giving it to our waiting task
- this might cause some 'grouping' of short-slice and long-slice
  tasks on each CPU -- this increases throughput for long-slice
  tasks, decreases latency for short-slice tasks and might even
  reduce memory contention between processors
This last effect, however much we might want it (do we?), is
very much implicit and not 'formalized' in code.
If we really want to have this effect, do we want to put it
into code or at least document it?

Agree. The current way is almost completely bogus, especially
on quad (or more) CPU machines...

 the next official kernel]
