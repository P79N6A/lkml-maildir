Eric and I had a brief side discussion, which we thought should
be shared with the other folks interested in this issue.

Since this has to be handled for MSI in general, it should be possible
to handle it for HyperTransport as well.
Our InfiniPath HT chip has an additional constraint that it needs a callback if
the vector changes, because a register past the config space also
has to change.
Or we have to have a way to disable migration from the driver (probably
not a bad idea anyway, for performance sensitive drivers), or both.

Definitely not what's wanted for multiple instances on large systems in
all cases (from a cache perspective, multiple adapters interrupting on
the same processor isn't necessarily bad, but beyond 2 per cpu is
a real problem with openib, in terms of available cpu cycles).

Probably.
