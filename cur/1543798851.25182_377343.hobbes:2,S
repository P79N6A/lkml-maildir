Some of the suggestions like using sysfs aren't too bad.
One value per file in text format is clean and not going
to change when you switch architectures :)
The rule should really be that you can't just argue against ioctl but

In this case I don't see any current problems.  But I don't
think this is a pattern we want to encourage, and if there
is a more maintainable pattern now would be the time to fix it.
