Can you store the segment in pci_bus->sysdata and then use that in
your config read/write macros? What do you mean by the mangling?
Does each host bridge have a separate segment identifier? If so why
would the PCI-PCI bridges below it need to have incorrect IDs?

Its possible customers will run X on their server, thats when getting
things like /proc/bus/pci/* right becomes important :) In fact on
sparc64 and ppc64 X should work with domains fairly easily because
they are already use /proc/bus/pci/* to mmap PCI BARs.
I think X should always use this method, reading PCI BARs and mmap'ing
/dev/mem is just awful.
