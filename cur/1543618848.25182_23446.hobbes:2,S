I participate in Mandrake's Cooker development and have been running into 
some power management issues with the latest kernel. Below is the message I 
had sent as well as the reply which pointed me in this direction:

2.4.18-pre7 (that 2.4.17-10mdk is based upon) has new APM patch. I
already have seen other reports about APM related problems in this
version (ironically this patch fixed problem I had).
I suggest you report it on lkml as you may have better chances there.
