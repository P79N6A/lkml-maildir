Subject: [2.6 patch] fix XFS_QUOTA for modular XFS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This patch by Dimitri Puzin submitted through kernel Bugzilla #5514 
fixes the following issue:
Cannot build XFS filesystem support as module with quota support. It 
works only when the XFS filesystem support is compiled into the kernel. 
Menuconfig prevents from setting CONFIG_XFS_FS=m and CONFIG_XFS_QUOTA=y.
How to reproduce: configure the XFS filesystem with quota support as 
module. The resulting kernel won't have quota support compiled into 
xfs.ko.
Fix: Changing the fs/xfs/Kconfig file from tristate to bool lets you 
configure the quota support to be compiled into the XFS module. The 
Makefile-linux-2.6 checks only for CONFIG_XFS_QUOTA=y.
