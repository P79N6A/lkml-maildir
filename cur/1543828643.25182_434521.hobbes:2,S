K6 run cooler even with the regular kernel HLT (sti/hlt I presume). 
Difference to full load can be up to 10 deg, depending on ambient (room) 
temperature. In winter (read 2005-12-31) it ran between 28 celsius and 34 
celsius. The fan even stopped and I thought it was a fan failure, but 
luckily it was just hw-controlled :)
