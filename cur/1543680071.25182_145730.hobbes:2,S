What you get when you set backlog to one is operating system dependent.
Tracing the flows with tcpdump, I get two clean handshakes so presumeably,
for linux, one means two.  The third connection request *isn't* dropped;
according to netstat, it's placed in the syn_recd state.  I thought
berkeley-derived implementations followed the rule that if there is no room
on the backlog queue for the new connection, tcp ignored the the received
syn.

Irrespective of whatever conditions linux applies, how can the connection
enter the syn_recd state if the backlog limit would be exceeded?  What's the
client supposed to do with the syn/ack from the server? What's the server
supposed to do with the ack it get's back from the client?
