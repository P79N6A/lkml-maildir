AFAIK, this has been the cases for basically ever. The inode
has been unlinked (st_nlink == 0) but the data blocks are
still there on disk, so the file will be deleted once you
close it, not earlier - things like that are not remembered
over an unmount/mount so the kernel doesn't let you unmount
the filesystem, it's really "busy" at that time.
If earlier kernels did let you do that, you basically ended
up with a slightly corrupted filesystems (a file present
on the fs without a directory entry) and a fsck would probably
let it show up again in /lost+found

Change init so that if you send it a signal (SIGHUP, whatever)
it re-executes itself. That's what /sbin/init in sysvinit
does to make it upgradable in-place without reboot, and in
fact to make it possible to actually reboot cleanly. Sysvinit
goes through great pains to send its internal state from
the old to the new init, your init is probably way way
simpler and you can manage with command line switches
( execl("/sbin/init", "init", "--restart", NULL) or something )
