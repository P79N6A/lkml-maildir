Just recently I had to run badblocks -ws on a scsi hard drive.  It was on
its own scsi controller.  During the write portions, I was able to see
pauses of 1-5 seconds.  Mouse didn't move, nothing.  During the read
(compare) portion, there were no such pauses.
This was on vanilla 2.4.16. 2x366 celeron, and 256MB ram.  Only reading with
mutt, and irc.  gkrellm showed the pauses.
