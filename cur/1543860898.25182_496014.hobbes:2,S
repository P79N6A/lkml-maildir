Ah... didn't notice that it was a TI controller you had. Then you
usually need an ugly setpci hack for it to work with sdhci. But the new
tifm_sd driver is the preferred solution.

As you have ndiswrapper rearing its ugly head just above, I would guess
it starts up your wlan card at interrupt 21 and kills it. I would
suggest trying without ndiswrapper loaded.
As this is now a tifm_sd related issue, I would recommend that Alex
Dubov takes over and the list of choice being the kernel mailing list
(both cc:d).
