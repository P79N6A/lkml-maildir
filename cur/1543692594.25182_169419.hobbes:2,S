We agree 100% here, have you read any of my emails in this thread?! I'm
not trying to place blame, it's a joint effort for sure.

Talk to glibc folks: point out the inconsistency. Maybe he'll be a good
boy and provide a patch, who knows. That's doesn't imply screaming.
And yes, I'm not on a mission to make sure that kernel headers
absolutely don't work from user space. And I'm even sure that had Joerg
provided a patch in his original email, it might even have been included
in the kernel. The attitude surely doesn't help either.
