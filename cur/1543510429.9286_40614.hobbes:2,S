Unfortunately, this is a known problem, and is caused by some sort of
political dispute between the site's ISP and their ISP's ISP, and as
such is completely outside my control.
I will add that I have really struggled as a result of this problem,
and have not even been able to get at my email for the last three
weeks due to this, as telnet access is also barred !!!
Apologies all, and I will keep you all informed as and when...
Best wishes from Riley.
