It's kind of nasty. The IO-APIC detection will disable the pirq table
stuff, see pci-irq.c:
                /* If we're using the I/O APIC, avoid using the PCI IRQ routing table */
                if (io_apic_assign_pci_irqs)
                        pirq_table = NULL;
now, you could just remove that logic, but I suspect that you'd get
problems simply because the interrupt will then get routing information,
but either the IO-APIC re-naming logic has already moved the irq and it
will be routed to the wrong entry.
So what I _think_ is the correct change is to do roughly this in
arch/i386/kernel/pci-irq.c:
 - in pcibios_fixup_irqs(), remove the
	#idef CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC
		...
	#endif
   section entirely.
 - in pcibios_enable_irq(), at the _end_ (after having enabled the irq
   with "pcibios_lookup_irq(dev, 1)", do something like
	irq = IO_APIC_get_PCI_irq_vector(dev->bus->number, PCI_SLOT(dev->devfn), pin);
	if (irq > 0)
		dev->irq = irq;
and add a LOT of debug printk's, and enable DEBUG in pci-i386.h.
It probably won't work on the first try (even if I explained the above
well enough), so send me and Ingo dmesg output, and maybe we'll figure out
something.
And if anybody else understands pirq routing, speak up. It's a black art.
