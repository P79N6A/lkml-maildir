Firewire isn't built in. I assume therefore this would have no effect.

I haven't tried to use it, but I agree that the outcome is similar. I 
recompiled with excessive debug output on 2.6.19-rc1, and uploaded the 
configs for 2.6.19-rc1 and 2.6.18, and the corresponding dmesg outputs. As 
you can see, 2.6.18 does not exhibit any problems.
