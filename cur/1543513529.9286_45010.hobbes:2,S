It is still an issue that  can easily be resolved during the test phase,
that's what -pre versions essentially are made for, aren't they? 
The trouble  about this is that  using the very  same configuration that
worked for 2.2.12 with all new offerings made by "make oldconfig" breaks
2.2.13 - this is annoying. 
I just  cannot see  why there haven't  been 2.2.13pre19 or  something as
release candidate  versions with the bootloader  fix - if  people say it
works, rename it to 2.2.13 and there you go. 
I'm not  telling you  anything new; I  have however the  impression that
something I don't see has urged  you to finally release 2.2.13 very fast
after a  prolonged time  of beta testing.  I'm not  sure if this  is the
truth, But this "2.2.13 cannot boot" need not have happened.

I'm not  going to  insult you,  I'm just annoyed  by 2.2.13  not booting
although the  bug had  been reported. What  were the  objections against
another couple of days beta-testing NEW boot-strap code?
