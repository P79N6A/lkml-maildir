Does linux handles writing "disk" to /sys/power/state and shutdown -P
now differently (except writing to disk part)? I have a Xen system and
if I try both (in dom0 which is linux) then writing "disk" powers off
the system while issuing shutdown command halts the system but the
system is still power on. Dom0 is using ramdisk so writing "disk" to
/sys/power/state should essentially be same as shutdown command.
