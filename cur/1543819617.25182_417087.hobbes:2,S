I should have mentioned before, it's suspend to RAM I'm using, by the way.

Yes, the only reservation I have about your patch, entirely unrelated to
this resume issue, is that those systems which "hwclock -w" on shutdown
(do they on suspend too? haven't looked) will slowly tend to lose time.

I don't think so, but I don't really know.  On resume, the disk
goes into ata_exec_internal's 30 second timeout which ends with
"ata1: qc timeout (cmd 0xef)": nothing wrong with that timeout, anyway.
I tend to assume that it's not anything subtle, just that something
there needs a delay which it accidentally happened to get (most of
the time) from the CMOS reading, and with that gone now falls over.
I'd be able to test patches from anyone who knows what they're
doing SATA-wise, but probably not until Friday.
