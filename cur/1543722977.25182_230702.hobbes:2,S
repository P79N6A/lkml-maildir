Hello,
I work with a logitech 4000 pro WebCam with the pwc driver;
I run it on RH9 linux with 2.4.20-8 kernel.
The driver is part of the linux kernel 2.4.20-8.  (and also above , of 
course).
Now , in  pwc_isoc_init() method  (in pwc-if.c)
there is the following call:
ret = usb_set_interface(pdev->udev, 0, pdev->valternate);
By debugging I saw that it uses alternate setting 2 (pdev->valternate=2).
Now , according to the next Linux Device Driver website , this is the
descriptor for that webcam: (and I verified it by cat /proc/bus/usb/devices)
http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdescr.php?id=2515
Now , I had tried to use a different alternate setting,1, for which
the Maximum Packet Size (MxPS) is 196.
So I set pdev->valternate to 1 in the beginning of the pwc_isoc_init().
the return value form usb_set_interface() is 0 ; this means success.
I also saw the the return value from usb_maxpacket is 196, which is indeed 
the
max packet size of alternate setting 1.
However, when I try to use a utility like ffmpeg to grab a video sequence it
fails immeditately in the beginning : it simply hangs
in the  pwc_video_ioctl() method. (in the case VIDIOCSYNC: )
I don't understand why; though I added printk() calls almost
everywhere in that case sentence of this pwc_video_ioctl()
it does not reach them ; it simply hangs.
My question is :
Given that descriptor - is it possible and correct to change alternate 
setting like I do ?
Or should I do something else?
Is it OK that the number of endpoint remains 5 in both cases
(when using altenate setting 2,which is the default,and when using
alternate setting 1 ?)
Any help will be appreciated.
The kernel log I got when running the ffmpeg util is below:
(I added some printing info where I thought it can give some hint):
