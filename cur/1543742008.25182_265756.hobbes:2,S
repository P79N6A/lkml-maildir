this is where the 80/20 rule holds:
80% of the people use the same 20 drivers ;)
so it's not as extreme as your words suggest (ok I cut a bunch out); but linux has so many users that even the few percent of users that has a less common setup leads to bugreport. And unlike some other OS'es, we all get to see all those reports...
