OK, and sorry if sending directly to Marcelo was the wrong thing to do
(I wouldn't have done that if the patch might affect other devices).
I've just played a little more with this device, and here is the really
minimal patch (new entry in unusual_devs.h for the flags, no other
changes in the code) - there should be no doubt if it's OK technically,
as it makes a device work that previously didn't...
The device I have is called "Sagatek DCS-CF", but the name "Sagatek"
is only on the packaging, and the "DCS-CF" is only on a small sticker
at tbe bottom side.  So I left the name "Datafab" in the entry,
assuming it's really the same device inside (same vendor:product ID)
so I guess it's a Datafab product and Sagatek really just sells it...
Please at least consider this - later, the larger issue of limiting
INQUIRY to 36 bytes might have a different solution (in the SCSI code),
but in the meantime this micro-patch is sufficient.  Thanks.
Regards,
Marek
