Actually, Andi is right. What I sent you was generated directly after 
boot, as I had to reboot for the right kernel, so a little later appeared 
this:
Aug  1 14:54:30 spit kernel: eth0: link up, 100Mbps, full-duplex, lpa 0x45E1
Aug  1 15:09:56 spit kernel: Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = 656747233 ns)
Aug  1 15:09:56 spit kernel: Time: pit clocksource has been installed.
bye, Roman
