I added this patch in my tree now with some trailing white-space
fixes, but no other changes.
As far as I can tell, platform_data never was in the the struct
pci_controller of the 2.5/2.6 tree, so it's really a new thing, not a
matter of "adding it back" (yeah it's in 2.4, but that's a separate
tree...).
