Look again.
4 years ago.
And yes, within the last four months or so ext3 has actually become
reality.
In large part, I suspect, because it became so painfully obvious that
ReiserFS was getting quite a lot of attention.
THAT is what I'm complaining about. Not the last couple of months. But the
years that preceded it.
I hope the MM thing doesn't turn into that. We need incremental
improvements, not grand schemes that get talked about.
