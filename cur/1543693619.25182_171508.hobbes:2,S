Dear Developers,
My desktop/server has been running 2.6.0-test1 kernel for a while and
recently I decided to try new ones but it crashes early on boot giving
me dump on test7 ( as well I've tried test6-bk9 before with the same
crash). pci=noacpi and then acpi=off didn't help - problem persisted
acpi_glue_init+0x1b/0x30
init_acpi+0x6/0x30
acpiphp_init+0x27/0x40
do_initcalls+0x2c/0xa0
....
Configuration and some system detailes are on 
http://www.onerussian.com/Linux/bugs/washoe.test7
Please give me any idea how I can help?
Thank you in advance
                                  .-.
