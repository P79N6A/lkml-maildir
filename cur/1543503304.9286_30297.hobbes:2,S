Are you by chance using IPX?  If so, disable the autoconfiguration of
the encapsulation.  For some reason Linux' 802.x-IPX and Spanning-Tree
don't like each other!  If you need to use IPX in a switched enviroment,
you'll have to go with EtherII.  In addition there seems to be a problem
if you have more than one encapsulation in use and both use the same
IPX network number, something Windows apparently allows but Linux rejects.
