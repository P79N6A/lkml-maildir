Makes sense, having hotplug events would be nice.  I've got a standalone bios 
emulator (based on the X int10 library) that I hope to open source soon, we 
could use that as a starting piont for the reset app.
+static void vga_enable(struct pci_dev *pdev, unsigned int enable)

+ outb(~0x08 & inb(0x46e8), 0x46e8);
+ outb(~0x01 & inb(0x102),  0x102);
+ pdev->resource[PCI_ROM_RESOURCE].flags &= ~IORESOURCE_VGA_ACTIVE;

+  vga_active = NULL;
+ bridge_no(pdev);
Those ins and outs won't work on all platforms unless they have a base address 
(assigned by arch code) associated with them.  But then again, I suppose if a 
platform supports more than one legacy I/O space, it also supports multiple 
active VGAs, so maybe this enable/disable code isn't needed for them...
