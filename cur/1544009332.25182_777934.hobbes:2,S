Seems like you have lots of disks, it could be you just have too much IO 
in flight at the same time for the size of the IOMMU area. You might be 
able to avoid that by increasing the SW-IOMMU size.
However, your system should be AHCI capable, you should try to switch 
the SATA controller into that mode in the BIOS (possibly labelled RAID 
mode or something). Then it shouldn't need to use bounce buffers for 
disk access in the first place (plus give you NCQ support).
