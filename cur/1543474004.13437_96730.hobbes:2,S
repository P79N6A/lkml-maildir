Subject: 2.2 pre4 SMP dmesg is noisy

Since this is the last call for changes while it's in development, I have pre4
and notice that dmesg prints this sort of stuff about my SMP box:
...
 16 000 00  1    0    0   0   0    0    0    00
 17 000 00  1    0    0   0   0    0    0    00
IRQ to pin mappings:
IRQ0 -> 2
IRQ1 -> 1
...
Not that I'm saying it's probably not helpful to someone somewhere, and not
that I'm saying dmesg can't be given a buffer big enough to hold the entire
output without losing stuff, but perhaps this kind of verbose output doesn't
need to be the default.
Thanks, and thanks for sending it out when the kernel coders think it's ready
and not when the impatient crowd thinks it should have been ready.
