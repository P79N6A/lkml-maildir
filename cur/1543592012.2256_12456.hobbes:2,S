You can wake user processes,send them signals etc but ingeneral its not

The unix model is much more that the app does
	while(1)
	{
		get_event(fd);
		switcH(event)
		{
				..
			...
		}
	}

The b_end_io callback can possibly be used, or Ben's asynchronosu callbacks,
but that deals with kernel level completion.
