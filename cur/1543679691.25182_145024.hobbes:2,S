Without this patch, audio skips horribly when I drag a large window.  With it, 
audio is skipless during window dragging, so I like this patch, whatever it 
does (maybe you'd like to do a victory lap and re-explain the theory?).  It's 
not perfect: in Mozilla, scrolling through a long page with the mouse still 
causes skipping.
I'm testing this on a AMD K7 1666 (actual) MHz, 512 MB, VIA VTxxx chipset, 
Software is 2.5.73+Gnome+Metacity+ALSA+Zinf.  Video hardware is S3 ProSavage 
K4M266, running in unaccelerated VGA mode, 1280x1024x16.  Yes, I know audio 
skips less if video is accelerated, IDE runs in dma, etc, but that's not a 
real solution to this soft realtime scheduling problem.
Regards,
Daniel
