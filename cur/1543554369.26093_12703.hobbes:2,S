	Linus,
	Sorry to bother you again, but a important note...
	I sent you the whole serie of patches. Then Dag sent it to you
again today. The patches were the same *except* for #14. Dag did
replace the original #14 patch that you didn't like with a cleaner
version (using empty packet to trigger speed changes).
	I'm sorry for the confusion. But don't worry, we will adjust
for whatever you put in test3 and work from there, so please don't do
anything ;-) And yes, I'll put it to the usual tests...
	And thanks again for taking the time to go through the patches
so quickly. We do appreciate your great work ;-)
	Have fun ;-)
	Jean
