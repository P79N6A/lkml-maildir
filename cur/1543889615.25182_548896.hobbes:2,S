Hello,
The fact that you see two monitors doesn't really surprise me  :) .
Also, i'm convinced to move to the mega patch even if i'm not quite sure
all that code is also needed and I know it will unnecessarily increase
the size of the kernel. However, better have much then less. Sure, if
there were any more information on the web about video card
connector/port logic, my knowledge would have been undoubtedly improved.
Anyway, adding (conn->ddc_type == ddc_monid) in the if condition in
radeon_i2c.c works for me as well.

Thank you for testing the patch.
