Funny I just happen to have a few stored results which the urls do work for. 
Reaim normally on 8x with the default options gets about 7500-7700 jobs per 
minute. 
Here are the links for 2.6.8-rc2-mm2 with default setting:
Peak load Test: Maximum Jobs per Minute 
8248.40 (average of 3 runs) 
Quick Convergence Test: Maximum Jobs per 
Minute 7723.62 (average of 3 runs) 
http://khack.osdl.org/stp/295657/
 
in non interactive mode: 
Peak load Test: Maximum Jobs per Minute 
8379.02 (average of 3 runs) 
Quick Convergence Test: Maximum Jobs per 
Minute 7922.50 (average of 3 runs) 
http://khack.osdl.org/stp/295658/
and in compute mode:
Peak load Test: Maximum Jobs per Minute 8590.94 (average of 3 runs) 
Quick Convergence Test: Maximum Jobs per Minute 8294.81 (average of 3 runs)
