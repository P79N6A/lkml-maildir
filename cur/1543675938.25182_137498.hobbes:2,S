Subject: lost interrupts with 2.4.1-rc6 and i875p chipset

I recently installed Debian on a new i875P chipset machine, and I'm
seeing frequent "hdX: lost interrupt" messages at the console under
2.4.21-rc6.  The IDE system appears to stall for 5 seconds or so
whenever this occurs (I assume that a reset/resync is occurring), but
then seems to recover.  It's pretty easy to reproduce... any
significant disk activity will trigger the problem.  In particular,
running fsck or copying files off a cdrom will expose the problem
within seconds.
This issue does not occur under 2.4.20.  Both kernels were compiled
using gcc 2.95.4, and no non-kernel modules are in use in either case
(no nvidia module, for instance).  I'd be happy to provide additional
information, if someone can point out what would be helpful.
