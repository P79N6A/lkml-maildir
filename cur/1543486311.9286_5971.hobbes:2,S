Your problem is not in missing libraries. Strace should work even if you have
missing libraries.
Have you tried manipulating the netscape file with other tools e.g.. cat or
whatever to see if file is accessible in the right way from the disk, you might
have some corrupt info there. Try moving the file in another dir. or something,
try fsck.
