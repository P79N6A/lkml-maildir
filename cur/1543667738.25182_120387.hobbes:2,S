You better use the latest patch :
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll-lt-2.4.20-0.3.diff
and the latest library/ephttpd server :
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll-lib-0.4.tar.gz
The new man pages are available here :
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_create.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_ctl.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_wait.txt
The crashes you're seen are because of a gcc error compiling the coroutine
library. The one that you'll find inside the epoll-lib should work. If I
remember well the problem was solved by switching from -O3 to -O2 when
building the coro library ...
