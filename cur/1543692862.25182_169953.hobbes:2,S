This maybe?
/proc/task -> 42/task/84

That wouldn't have worked with /proc/self pointing to
an invisible directory like it did. It could certainly
be made to work, like this:
/proc/self -> 42/task/84
Had the /proc/self code not been modified, you'd get
a nasty link like this:
/proc/self -> 84   (and "84" isn't listed in /proc)
So using "/proc/self/../.." would just go up to "/".
That's not too useful.
