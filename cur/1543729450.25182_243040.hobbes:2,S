could you try the attached patch that changes SHA_CODE_SIZE to 3 - does
this reduce the latency caused by extract_entropy?

so that they dont starve the audio threads by default - the audio IRQ
has to get another priority anyway. Maybe we could try a default
SCHED_FIFO prio lower than the typical rt_priority of jackd - e.g. 30?
