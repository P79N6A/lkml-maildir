Supposedly WinXP-32 doesn't use memory over 4 GB even if it is available 
(a market-segmentation decision of the part of Microsoft, to force 
people to buy WinServer 2003; WinXP SP2 does PAE so there is no 
technical reason.)  This probably has disincentivized hardware vendors 
from providing support for remapping the memory from the aperture above 
the 4 GB mark.  The logic isn't all that trivial, especially if the 
aperture size is configurable, so I can understand why they would punt.
