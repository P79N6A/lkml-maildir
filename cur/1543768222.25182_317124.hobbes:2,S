irqbalance nowadays rotates the timer interrupt every 10 seconds after
some people complained that having it always on the same cpu penalized
their HPC apps unbalanced. (they glued those tasks to each cpu). It's
not a big deal (the irq rate isn't that high) and it does make things
slightly more fair in the HPC case.
