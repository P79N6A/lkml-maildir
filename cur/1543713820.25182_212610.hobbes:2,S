I finally managed to track down the problem.  In 2.6.5, ide-probe.c
line 291 there is this piece of code:
    if ((a ^ s) & ~INDEX_STAT) {
        printk(KERN_INFO "%s: probing with STATUS(0x%02x) instead of "
                "ALTSTATUS(0x%02x)\n", drive->name, s, a);
        /* ancient Seagate drives, broken interfaces */
       hd_status = IDE_STATUS_REG;
This alternative probing mechanism caused the kernel to conclude that
the device hdf does exist, and disabling this ancient Seagate drive
probing functionality fixed my problem (but obviously breaks the
probing of the said ancient drives).
What would be a good way to resolve this problem?
