I have the same problem, and reported it back in 2.4.21-pre-something, but
nobody seemed interested.  I have the same problem with onboard chipsets
as with addon PCI cards from various manufacturers.  It's absolutely
impossible to enable DMA on the SiI controllers.  The "funny" thing is
that I purchased them on a recommendation from someone on lk who glowed
over their robustness.
