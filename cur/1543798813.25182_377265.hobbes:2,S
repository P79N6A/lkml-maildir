Could someone please explain to me how the uverbs abuse of write
is better that ioctl?  
Every single command seems to have a __u64 response fields that is a
pointer into user space.  When you write your commands and read your
responses like the netlink layer does I can see the sense of it.  But
making write an ioctl by another name...
One of the scarier comments I have seen lately from ib_user_verbs.h
/*
 * Make sure that all structs defined in this file remain laid out so
 * that they pack the same way on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures (to
 * avoid incompatibility between 32-bit userspace and 64-bit kernels).
 * Specifically:
 *  - Do not use pointer types -- pass pointers in __u64 instead.
 *  - Make sure that any structure larger than 4 bytes is padded to a
 *    multiple of 8 bytes.  Otherwise the structure size will be
 *    different between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
 */
The two points that get called out.
- Embedded pointers are a large part of what make ioctl a maintenance
  nightmare.  I admit we are 15-20 years away before big machines
  exhaust the capability of 64bit pointers so we aren't likely
  to run into size issues soon.  But a write that changes your address
  space is ugly, and unexpected.
  What looks like a reimplementation of readv/writev using this
  technique is also scary.
- 64bit compilers will not pad every structure to 8 bytes.  This
  only will happen if you happen to have an 8 byte element in your
  structure that is only aligned to 32bits by a 32bit structure.
  Unfortunately the 32bit gcc only aligns long long to 32bits on
  x86, which triggers the described behavior.
