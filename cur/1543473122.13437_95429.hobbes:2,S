Erm... What I really wonder is how much would we lose on the following
policy:
Request 1: <write new data block>, depends on <>
Request 2: <write new indirect block> or <add a pointer to existing one>,
	depends on <1>
Request 3: <update inode block>, depends on <2>.
	In the worst case it will give us lost block, not attached to
anything. BFD.
	With the current ext2 + bdflush we can get _any_ order at all,
AFAI can see.
