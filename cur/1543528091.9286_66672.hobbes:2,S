Werner told you about the nocheck option already. On the deamon startup:
If you use X and a display manager just rename /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S??xdm to
something like /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S01xdm and X will startup first. The only
thing you have to start before X is the fontserver (if you use one). I'm
running this configuration for >1 year without problems, YMMV.
