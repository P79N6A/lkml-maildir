I've been using self-compiled gcc/g++/libstc++-2.8.1 for almost a year
now.  It's compiled my kernels, and all the other software I've compiled
(gnome, kde, qt, glib, gtk+, X, glibc, etc) during that time, with nary
a hitch.  I understand that some may have had problems with it, but I
just don't see it.  If you're having problems with egcs, maybe give gcc
another shot...
