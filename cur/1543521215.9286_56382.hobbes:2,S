When I look at the source, both are included. Some of the systems I run
it on do NOT have assembler versions. CRAY T-90, T-3E, J90, SV1.

That is true for small sections of code (60-200 lines of assembler). After that
the programmer gets tired and ends up starting to make optimization errors.
(been there, done that. It wasn't fun either:)
As far as copying data around; char [something] won't quite do it. You end
up only passing the address of the array. Have to do:
typedef struct {
 	char data[something]
} data_type;
Then when:
data_type a, b;
you can say a = b and expect a copy of the structure. And if you do need

It would definitly clear it up.

If I can get some time, I may experiment with it just to see how hard it
would be to implement. (Optimization might be difficult..:)
