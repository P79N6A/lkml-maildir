Most flash chips are synchronous.  Some support erase suspend - an erase
operation can be indefinitely suspended to give faster read and write
operations priority.  That's about it.
For the foreseeable future I believe synchronous operations are the
correct way to deal with raw flash chips.

That may make sense, yes.  "May", because there is no simple mapping
between physical data and logical data.  In ext3, everything is
block-aligned, usually to 4KiB == PAGE_SIZE.  So the exact same content
would exists in two pages.  In LogFS, data is compressed and
byte-aligned.  A bdev page can contain several full objects that after
uncompression get stored in one page each.

It should and I've already fixed it since sending the patches.

Indeed.  Will do.
