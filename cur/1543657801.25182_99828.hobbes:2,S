At the time of hugetlbfs' integration, it was desirable to be
minimalistic and the additional logic for placement had no clear
motivation, as both privilege and great self-awareness were assumed
of the applications using hugetlbfs. Since then, it's become apparent
that this placement logic is a requirement for userspace support.
Apologies in advance for great tardiness; however, I'll send in patches
implementing in-kernel automatic hugetlb vma placement within 36 hours.

Documentation updates are also essential, they will also follow shortly,
in tandem with the automatic vma placement.

Ulrich Drepper has already accepted a glibc patch integrating the
SHM_HUGETLB flag into glibc. dada1, I'm hopeful your distribution will
provide you with an upgrade path to a glibc version implementing it soon,
or that you'll otherwise be able to upgrade to a cvs glibc version.

This fix is trivially correct; thanks for finding and addressing it.
Linus, please apply.
Thanks for the testing, bugreports, and fixes!
Thanks,
Bill
