I am monitoring all my drives with smart constantly, and they haven't shown
any symptoms. The corruption only happens upon reboot, which is a quite
rare event for a server.
Also, I find that smart rarely gives much useful warnings beforehand when a
drive is about to fail. And when the drive fails I usually get a good doze
of UncorrectableErrors into the log, not silent corruption (and I've seen a
lot drives to fail ;( ). Silent corruption is usually caused by the chipset
or driver (seen that, too ;( ), but it has usually happened under stress,
not when nothing much is being written to the drive.
