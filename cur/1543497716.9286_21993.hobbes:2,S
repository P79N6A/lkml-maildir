It *is* a limitation of the common BIOS implementations. Although most
BIOS'es offer support for 2880k images which should still be big enough for
ernel and initrd with all modules and usermode programs needed to get access
for the bigger devices (CD-ROM, net,...) where the rest of installation data
is located.
This is planned for the upcoming Debian release.

To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.            --unknown source
