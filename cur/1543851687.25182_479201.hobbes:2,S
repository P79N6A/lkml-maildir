Andi, Vivek is right.  We can use end_pfn_map.  My observation is wrong.

Vivek, the problem condition is in generic reserve_bootmem_core
(mm/bootmem.c), where this
	BUG_ON(PFN_DOWN(addr) >= bdata->node_low_pfn);
checks the target address against the top of that node's memory.

I wasn't accurate.  I should have said that the top of memory as seen in
that function is the top of the memory for the node of usable memory.
Since the user defined map as passed in the kexec tools is accurate, we
do need the conditional check to avoid this problem.  I'm more than
happy to work in a second patch to export the MP table location to user
space for the kexec tools (the ES7000 will be a special case even for
that feature since the MP tables already reside in a reserved area).
thanks,
Amul
