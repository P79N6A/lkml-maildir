Sorry my wording was incorrect. It currently *always* retries the
merge if it had at first failed, and after the patch, we never retry.
So it should not result in behavioural shifts when there is a VM load
is high.
It seems to be a clear source of problems for Kenneth though, because
his workload appears to have almost zero merges, so he'll always be
invoking the merge logic twice.
I agree there is potential for subtle interactions. But generally the
block layer is surprisingly well behaved in my experience.
As Jens said, the complete removal of the GFP_ATOMIC allocation probably
has the most potential for problems in this regard, although bios are not
using GFP_ATOMIC allocations, so I would be a little surprised if it made
a really noticable difference.
