It still hangs on the second sleep.  I faked them in the kernel instead
of the DSDT, by faking them in acpi_evaluate_integer() like so:

Each thermal zone loaded with produced printk's like "Faking _TMP", etc,
so the patch was working.  It shouldn't change the result if instead I
make all the _TMP methods in the DSDT return 0xBB8 (or whatever the
magic number was).
So my plan, which I'm trying now, is to keep _TMP faked for all zones,
and take away one zone at a time until the hang goes away.  If I take
away all of THM[267], then it won't hang (since THM0 by itself hangs but
THM0 without _TMP does not hang).  But I hope that an earlier
combination in the search will not hang.
