Something very strange is going on with my machine.  With 2.4.18, I was 
getting 38MB/s on my main system disk (IBM Deskstar 60gxp), and 35 for 
the other drives (Western Digital).  The IBM drive is on a Promise IDE 
controller (ASUS A7V266-E motherboard), and the others are on a PROMISE 
2069 UDMA133 controller.  However, with 2.4.21 and 2.4.22, it will not 
set the using_dma flag for my IBM drive, but sets it for the others, 
which now get sustained transfer rates of 46MB/s or greater.  I'm using 
the same options for all 3 kernels (at least, for the ATA/IDE options). 
  Any help would be appreciated, and I'll see if maybe I could do 
something with it when I get time.
Thanks,
Justin
