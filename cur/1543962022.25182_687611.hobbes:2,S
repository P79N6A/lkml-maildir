Looked at this a bit more..
v86d emulator seems to be hardcoding
mem_bios as 0x0a0000 - 0x10ffef
And mmaping the whole address and may be doing read write in that range
during the emulation.
But, as per e820 0x100000 onwards is usable memory and may be getting
used by kernel. So, surely there is some conflict here.
I am not sure whether it is the BIOS that is giving wrong E820 info or
is it the v86d emulator making assumption about this address wrongly.
One workaround is to make upto 0x10ffef as reserved and make kernel not
use it. But, we should really know why this problem is happening in the
first place, before going the workaround route.
Thanks,
Venki
