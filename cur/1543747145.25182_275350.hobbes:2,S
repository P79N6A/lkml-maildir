The sysfs code has a bunch of these, and I think it's one of the hardest
to follow and least palatable parts of working with it.  It makes
finding real declarations hard, and can make debugging a pain if
something goes wrong.  You get an error in ckrm_cb_FOO(), cscope or grep
for 'ckrm_cb_FOO' and scratch your head when you come up with squat.
