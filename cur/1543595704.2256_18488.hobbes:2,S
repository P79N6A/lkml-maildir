Yeah I've seen it, but they won't tell people what is in it which is useless
to non windows people. The whole procedure is quite complex because the fixups
depend which PCI cards you have (eg ES137x 'SB PCI 64/SB PCI 128' cards don't
work with the base set of fixups but apparently use a different set)
