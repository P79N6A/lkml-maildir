No you haven't.  It doesn't have a file of that name, so you
didn't see such a BUG().  And I don't know about you, but my
copy of 2.5.39 has no BUG() anywhere in the ohci-hcd driver,
so it'd be hard seeing _any_ BUG() coming from there.
You might be hitting a different BUG(), but in that case you
would need to get your bug reports straight.
