As I said, I forgot the actual frequency, so 800 ticks is a guess...

Hm, could you please do 
# for f in `cat scaling_available_frequencies `; do echo $f >scaling_setspeed ; cat cpuinfo_cur_freq ; cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq ; done
instead? scaling_cur_freq doesn't give as useful _debug_ results as
cpuinfo_cur_freq, and it's important to get it for _both_ siblings after
_each_ change

That's some sort of sysfs "handling" - don't know about details and
consequences.

Maybe because much/more work is done by the other sibling then... however,
without the test above [cpuinfo_cur_freq for both siblings] I can't say
much, I'm afraid.

The use of the p4-clockmod driver is that it puts the CPU into a low-power
state -- it only has thermal and power consequences, however, if either the
"idling" does not work, or the processor load is higher than the frequency
the CPU is put into by p4-clockmod.

No. This is motherboard-specific. The P4 does not support _voltage scaling_,
i.e. runtime voltage adjustment based on current power needs. It also
doesn't support _frequency scaling_, just (thermal) throttling.

Unfortunately, p4-clockmod isn't really all that useful -- but that's
because the hardware doesn't support voltage and/or frequency scaling.
