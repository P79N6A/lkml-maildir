Marcelo,
This trivial one line patch corrects my mistake in ips.h. I assure you
that the previous patch was compiled and tested extensively - over a
several month test cycle.  However, our testing concentrates on existing
customers and shipping distro's.  Most of those changed to the 2.6
kernel on or before 2.4.20, so we had no 2.4 kernel in our test matrix
beyond that. I apologize for the oversight - we must update our test
matrix to always check out latest 2.4 development kernel.
The concerns expressed below about this driver being "blindly submitted"
or is "untested" are completely unwarranted.
Thanks.
Jack

This update was obviously submitted without even testing the compilation
of the driver (not to mention testing whether it actually works).
Even worse:
We had _exactly the same problem_ with the 7.00.15 driver in 
2.4.27-pre3, but 7.10.18 now simply reverts my (trivial) fix for this 
compile error.
Marcelo, can you please refuse patches from people who don't bother to 
do even the simplest compile testing when blindly submitting the latest 
version of a driver?
TIA
Adrian
