Hello there!
Today I got this on my home-workstation in system log:
Nov  3 18:36:33 jackson kernel: kernel BUG at file.c:94!
Nov  3 18:36:33 jackson kernel: invalid operand: 0000
Nov  3 18:36:33 jackson kernel: CPU:    0
System: 
  Linux: 2.3.23
  Proc:  IDT Winchip II
It occured when I had to laod two files from a vfat floppy in Star
Office (:-()
After Star Office crashed (the "normal" behaviour sometimes...) Linux
wasn't able to write to any file!!
So I had to SysReq sync / umount / reboot.
After reboot I tryed the same again. I got the same lines in my system 
log, but after Star Office crashed again this time Linux was able to
write to files...??
I hope it's interesting to someone - thanks for listening.
