Always the same problem. Some stupid people here think that they have
designed the most wonderful AES hardware module. If I give you the
code of the driver I'll show you a lot of "confidential" stuff.

Again, my code is faster only because I skip the key loading in
"cia_encrypt" method. Actually the gain is bigger in decryption mode
than in encryption one because I also generate the decryption key for
each block.
You see there's absolutely no clever trick here...
