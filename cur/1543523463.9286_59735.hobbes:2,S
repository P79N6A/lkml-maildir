Nod, and that isn't very good. Although violating NFSv2 protocol _has_ to
be done if you want to guarantee any(*) performance, it's still bad idea as
default behavior.

(*) On HP-(S)UX, the default behavior is standard-based and there is
async-writes option. Between HP-(S)UXes, performance increase is roughly
10-fold between sync<>async. I haven't tried it with Linux, but I expect
results to match.
