Why do you say so?

Would you accept it as the default? Would Linus?
(With disk I/O we are terribly conservative, using very cautious settings,
and many people use hdparm to double or triple their disk speed.
But for a few these optimistic settings cause data corruption,
so we do not make it the default.
Similarly I would be happy if the "no overcommit", "no OOM killer"
situation was the default. The people who need a reliable system
will leave it that way. The people who do not mind if some process
is killed once in a while use vmparm or /proc/vm/overcommit or so
to make Linux achieve more on average.)
