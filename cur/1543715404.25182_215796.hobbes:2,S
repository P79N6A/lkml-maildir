I don't see where you want to go. An attacker will have to fire at least
one "bullet" per port, per sequence number block and per timestamp if any.
That's the basis of the protocol. You were asking if *one* packet sent
to a broadcast address could reset *every* TCP connections, David showed
you that broadcasts were dropped, and I showed you that you need as many
packets as possible combinations to shoot all connections. That's all.
And BTW, do you think that such a "serious" vulnerability wouldn't have
been demonstrated on live sites if it was so obvious ? Don't worry, we
still have a few years in front of us before home networks are fast enough
to scan such large ranges in a matter of days.
Cheers,
Willy
