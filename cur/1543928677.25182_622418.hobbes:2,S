Subject: does /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe actually do anything?

  (i asked about this earlier on the newbies list, but after poking
around a bit more, i thought i'd ask here.)
  according to Documentation/debugging-modules.txt:
The correct way of debugging module problems is something like this:
echo '#! /bin/sh' > /tmp/modprobe
echo 'echo "$@" >> /tmp/modprobe.log' >> /tmp/modprobe
echo 'exec /sbin/modprobe "$@"' >> /tmp/modprobe
chmod a+x /tmp/modprobe
echo /tmp/modprobe > /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe
  i've tried that and i don't see that it does anything whatsoever.  i
ran modprobe under "strace" and it doesn't appear to make any effort
to check /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe.  i even downloaded the source to
the module-init-tools package and scanned the source and ... nothing.
  so what's up with that?
