There isn't now, but there will be in the not-too-distant future.  The
user-mode port (see 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net
) can do
this.  I had SMP turned on and more or less working around 2.3.26.  It
shouldn't be a big deal to turn it bad on, fix the bugs, and get it
working.
Once that's done, you can start it up with "ncpus=2" or "ncpus=32",
and you get that many virtual processors.
