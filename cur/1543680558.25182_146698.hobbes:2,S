Hi.
The latest 2.5.74-bk kernel have resolved the PnP issues that had
stopped my Turtle Beach Malibu sound card from working. Previously
trying to activate the card always failed, but I'm pleased to say that
it now works ...
$ cat /proc/asound/cards
0 [CS4237B        ]: CS4237B - CS4237B
                     CS4237B at 0x534, irq 5, dma 1&3
$
My thanks to the ALSA and PnP maintainers for achieving this.
