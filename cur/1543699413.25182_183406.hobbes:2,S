Can anyone help out? Tried building 2.6.0-test11 today and, lo and 
behold, noticed the support for my Initio SCSI card has been removed - 
is this a permanent thing or will it show back up soon? It's an Initio 
9100U using the 2.4.x series initio.o module - or will I be stuck using 
the 2.4 series? Any feedback is appreciated.
Thanks,
RunNHide
