Andi, you are getting mixed up with software only ability to offline with 
hardware eject capability. ACPI indicates ability to hotplug by the presence
of _EJD in the appropriate scope of the object. So ACPI does have ability to 
do what you mention above precicely, but the entire namespace is not known 
upfront since some could be dynamically loaded. Which is why we need to show 
the entire NR_CPUS as hotpluggable. 
Possibly we can keep cpu_possible_map as NR_CPUS only when support for 
PHYSICAL_CPU_HOTPLUG is present, otherwise we can keep it
cloned as cpu_present_map. (we dont have a generic PHYSICAL hotplug CONFIG
option today)
What CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y indicates is ability to offline a processor from the
kernel. It DOES NOT indicate physical hotpluggablity.  So we dont need any
hardware support (apart arch/kernel support) for this to work. Support
for physical hotplug is indicated via CONFIG_ACPI_HOTPLUG_CPU.
Be aware that suspend/resume folks using CPU hotplug to offline CPUS except
BSP need just the kernel support to offline. BIOS has nothing to do with 
being able to offline a CPU (preferably called as soft-removal).
Cheers,
ashok
