I think I've hit this bug as well or possibly something related to it, but 
back in 2.6.7-rc1, however I was not able to recreate the issue. I posted a 
message about this to lkml on the 28/05/04 with the subject of:
 [2.6.7-rc1][BUG][ACPI] os_wait_semaphore: Failed to aquire semaphore (loop)
Attached was my config and some debug output, which included a call trace and 
register dump.
Reason I think it's related to this one is that the problem was a continual 
loop on os_wait_semaphore. I was running with CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=y, otherwise 
I doubt I would have noticed why it froze.
Hope this helps.
