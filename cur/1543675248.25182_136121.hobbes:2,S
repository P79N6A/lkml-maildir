I am using via82xx and I have all the alsa stuff configured as
modules and every time I do  /etc/init.d/alsasound start I get the
following:
Starting sound driver: snd-via82xx done
/usr/sbin/alsactl: set_control:780: failed to obtain info for control
#37 (No such file or directory)
/usr/sbin/alsactl: set_control:780: failed to obtain info for control
#38 (No such file or directory)
/usr/sbin/alsactl: set_control:780: failed to obtain info for control
#39 (No such file or directory)
Any assistance would be appreciated.
