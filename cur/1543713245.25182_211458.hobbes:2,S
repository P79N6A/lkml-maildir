No, I mean that they currently call fstat().  In future they'd need to
call fstat()+getxattr().
If it's a per-filesystem quantity, then of course fstat() is all they
need.  So that would be great.

Buugy, perhaps, but quite useful sometimes.  It's not a problem, if
we're clear that it's a per-filesystem quantity.  That kind of NFS
server configuration can advertise the coarsest timestamp resolution
of all the underlying filesystems.
NFS is not the only remote filesystem, and some like Samba can
certainly span multiple underlying filesystems without violating any
specificaiton.
With that in mind, we'd need to be clear that the resolution actually
stored may exceed the resolution advertised.  I don't know whether
that breaks coreutils' assumption.
