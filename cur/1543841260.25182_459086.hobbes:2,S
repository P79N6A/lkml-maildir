Well. but you could do the initialization at open time too, like the other

Well, ok.
The real question seems to be if we want to keep the firmware inside the
driver or not.
If we want to remove it, then we put, not the module, but the firmware itself
with some basic userspace to load it on demand in the initramfs, and this is
reason enough to create an initramfs. The fact that the builtin device is
initialized before the initramfs is loaded seems like a bug to me, since the
idea of the initramfs (well, one of them at least), was to initialize it early
enough for this kind of things.
If on the other side, it is more important to not have an initramfs (because
of security issues, or bootloader constraints or what not), then sure, there
is not much choice than putting the firmware in the driver or in the kernel
directly.
But again, the initramfs is just a memory space available at the end of the
kernel, and there is no hardware-related constraint to access it which are in
any way different from having the firmware linked in together with the kernel,
so it is only a matter of organisation of code, as well as taking a decision
on the above, and to act accordyingly.
Does using an initramfs really have some negative side, security related ?
Would some kind of signed or encrypted initramfs be preferable there ?
