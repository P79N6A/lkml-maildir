Subject: 2.4.3 SMP: nfs stale handle, fb dualhead hardlock, G400/450 misnaming
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

1. stale NFS file handle
	2.4.2-ac28 serving nfs3 from reiserfs
	2.4.3 being nfs3 client,
	nfs damn slow on 100Mbps p2p link.
	mounted nfs  with rsize=8192,wsize=8192
	nfs fast.
	soon got :
		bash-2.04$ls
		ls .: stale NFS file handle
	just about home directory it says so.
2. Hard lockup:
	G450, I set con2fb, switch consoles some times and there it comes.
	swithc between X and single console is OK.
3. seems that I have G450 and linux shows it as G400. 
	bash-2.04$ /sbin/lspci:
	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Matrox Graphics, Inc. MGA G400 AGP (rev 82)	
	/proc/pci:
	 VGA compatible controller: Matrox Graphics, Inc. MGA G400 AGP (rev 130).
	/sbin/lspci -n
	01:00.0 Class 0300: 102b:0525 (rev 82)
	at least when I finally, after a longlong braindamage, started
	using G450 stuff everywhere, it become more and more usable.
	for dual fb X it is stable and usable now.
	G400 drivers also work, but matroxset aint switching second head
	to monitor output, neither does anything else. It remains blank.
