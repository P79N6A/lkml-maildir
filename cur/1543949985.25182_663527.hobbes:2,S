No guarantee there. We report whatever firmware tells us.

Stronger guarantee here, since both pci_slot and <foo>hp driver
will be getting the name of the slot from the same place.

We saw problems on Fujitsu machines, where they return an error
code when the _SUN method is called on a slot that exists in the
namespace but isn't actually present.
After discussing with Kenji-san about specs, we came to the
agreement that he was ok with this behavior because he had the
option to not load pci_slot on his machines.
I agree that there might be lots of buggy firmwares out there,
but we won't know for certain until we get some exposure. And I
think the upside is worth it.
Kristen suggested the linux-next tree. That sounds viable to
me...

Of course we shouldn't break userspace, no one wants that. But
nothing about that name (/sys/bus/pci/slots/) implies "hotplug
only", and we have no idea how big the problem might be.
Again, I'm thinking more exposure in linux-next might be a
reasonable way for us to figure out how bad (or good) the
situation might really be out there.
Thanks.
