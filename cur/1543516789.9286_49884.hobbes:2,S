Hi,
  I have a box with IP address xxx.xxx.x.41 ie its an 
odd IP address. In the ip_rcv function in
net/ip_input.c file, i am testing for the incomming IP
packets,  
    if ip->saddr ==  odd 
        goto dropit;
I am dropping it if the source IP address of incomming
IP packets is odd.
   But, when I compile the kernel with such a
condition
I am not able to access the network.
Any particular reason for such a situation to occur.
I am using RED HAT 6.0 
Thanks
SUJIT
