   That doesn't make it right, it merely makes the perpetrator wrong.
To be honest, I like having someone like him who can just put his foot
down on a matter whilst the rest of us waste days in silly flame wars
on the topic. :-)
I've stop caring, personally.  Back it out, it wouldn't bother me.
I made a patch someone asked me to make, so sue me.
What bothers me is all the time being spent arguing about it.
