Since these changes are not simply moving code around, we really do need 
full explanations for them, and to understand their need.
Blindly copying code from an exterior driver is pointless, and no way at 
all to run an engineering process.
If the driver is not going to get the review and attention necessary, 
bug fixes and feedback attended-to, then there's not much point in 
having this driver in the kernel at all.
You will only lead yourself to frustration, if you set up a system where 
changes only flow one way.  That's not how Linux development is done at all.
