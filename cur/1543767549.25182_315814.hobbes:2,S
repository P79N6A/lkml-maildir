I was thinking about delving into this problem a bit.   I don't have any 
unpartitioned free space on my physical drive.  I was going to ask if 
it's possible to create a virtual device in RAM or in a file that I 
could then create an ext3 file system on for testing.. I'm at least 
trying to recreate the situation of the negative diskspace usage.. then 
maybe try to debug ext3 a bit.  At first I thought "oh RAMFS!", then "no 
wait, I couldn't create an EXT3 file system that way".. I need a 
non-physical (block? or character?) device.
Thanks,
  Davy
