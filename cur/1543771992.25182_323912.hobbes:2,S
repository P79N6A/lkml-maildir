I've been having this problem in 2.6.12-rc2 and 2.6.12-rc6.
Any continued access to /dev/hda causes a complete and total
lock up of the system. Nothing is logged to /var/log/kernel
or /var/log/messages. Just a solid freeze.
This happens with at least cdparanoia and cdrecord as well.
The machine is an AMD64 FX55 CPU running in a shuttle
ST20G5 chassis.
The specs for the chipset say:
   ATi RADEON XPRESS 200 + ULi 1573 chipset
lspci produces (but doesn't say anything about the spec'ed chips):

Any ideas? I would really like to see this go away before 2.6.12
comes out. But it's been present for quite a while.
