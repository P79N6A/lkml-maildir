Switch to edge triggered, wait , switch back to level triggered - I've
added that to my sysrq commands, and it clears the IRR bit in the IO
APIC. Sometimes 2 or 3 attempts are required.
I tried several changes to the ioapic code, but without success.
I found:
* the io_apic_sync() in __mask_IO_APIC_irq() is probably wrong, I'd say
it should be _after_ the io_apic_modify, but currently it is before the
io_apic_modify(). 2.2 uses the same code, that doesn't explain the
problem.

+       co_apic_write(CO_APIC_LO(ent), CO_APIC_MASK);
+       (void)co_apic_read(CO_APIC_LO(ent)); /* sync cpu to cobalt apic
*/
+}

It's possible that the comment is about an cobalt specific problem, the
IRR bit is - according the Intel documentation - read only.
