Subject: unresolved symbols: Compiler/modutils bug?

Hello,
Yesturday I was experimenting with video4linux Buz/DC10+ driver
which requires bigphysarea kernel patch and something strange was
going on... Here is a sequence of events:
1. Applying the patch and reconfiguring the kernel - no problem,
2. Compilation of the latest 2.2.14 kernel and modules - OK
3. Reboot into single user level, run depmod -a - OK,
4. Switch to multiuser - OK.
5. Compilation of Buz/DC10+ drivers to take effect of bigphysarea
patch - no problem.
6. insmod video..., i2c, etc. - OK.
7. insmod buz.o -> unresolved symbol(s): bigphysarea_xxxxxxxxx
I've tried to compile the kernel with gcc 2.7.2.3 and egcs coming
with RedHat 6.1 and different modutils: 2.1.121 and 2.3.7, the
result was the same. Then I've started to check the internals...
Checking Sysmap: everything looks fine, these symbols are there.
Checking /proc/ksyms shows that something strange is there: all
symbols look OK but those ones related to bigphysarea:
cxxxxxx find_vma_Rxxxxxxxx
cxxxxxx get_unmapped_area_Rxxxxxxxx
cxxxxxx bigphysarea_alloc_R__ver_bigphysarea_alloc
cxxxxxx bigphysarea_free_R__ver_bigphysarea_free
cxxxxxx bigphysarea_alloc_pages_R__ver_bigphysarea_alloc_pages
cxxxxxx bigphysarea_free_pages_R__ver_bigphysarea_free_pages
cxxxxxx bigphysarea_R__ver_bigphysarea
cxxxxxx in_group_p_Rxxxxxxxx
cxxxxxx update_atime_Rxxxxxxxx
I've placed xxxxxxx here just because I did not save /proc/ksyms
contents, sorry. Then I've looked at kernel/ksyms.c, the
corresponding part of this file after bigphysarea patch was this:
EXPORT_SYMBOL(find_vma);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(get_unmapped_area);
#ifdef CONFIG_BIGPHYS_AREA
EXPORT_SYMBOL(bigphysarea_alloc);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(bigphysarea_free);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(bigphysarea_alloc_pages);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(bigphysarea_free_pages);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(bigphysarea);
#endif
/* filesystem internal functions */
EXPORT_SYMBOL(in_group_p);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(update_atime);
Well, I've thought, let's try stupid thing: remove (comment out)
these conditional cpp statements:
EXPORT_SYMBOL(find_vma);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(get_unmapped_area);
/* #ifdef CONFIG_BIGPHYS_AREA */
EXPORT_SYMBOL(bigphysarea_alloc);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(bigphysarea_free);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(bigphysarea_alloc_pages);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(bigphysarea_free_pages);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(bigphysarea);
/* #endif */
/* filesystem internal functions */
EXPORT_SYMBOL(in_group_p);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(update_atime);
Then. again compiling the kernel, modules and reboot... And now it
works!
So, what went wrong? Any ideas?
