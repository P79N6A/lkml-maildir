Hold off on this one.  I have different fixes for this in my tree.
The system ptrace headers (asm/ptrace.h, sys/ptrace.h, linux/ptrace.h) have
varying effects, depending on distro and architecture.  So, I decided to put
sysdep/ptrace_user.h in charge of supplying the system ptrace information to
the rest of UML.  This has some ripple effects which I am in the process of
sorting out.
On the system calls, I have them indef-ed depending on whether one of the
__NR_vperf symbols are defined.  This will go away when the entry points
are in both -mm and -linus.
