Andrew,
Just got around to testing lockmeter with 2.6.9-rc2-mm4.  It compiles
and works fine on i386, both in preempt and non-preempt kernels.
On Altix it compiles and boots fine, but hangs when you try to turn on
the lockmeter statististics (with "lockmeter on").  I'll pursue that
further tomorrow.
