Only a couple of minor ones - you don't need to have ext2 enabled in the
kernel if you use ext3 exclusively.  You should change the "if you have
your root filesystem as ext3 ... may be dangerous" wording to something
more like "if you use ext3 for your root filesystm you should not compile
this as a module", because _lots_ of people do that and then complain on
ext3-users...
Cheers, Andreas
