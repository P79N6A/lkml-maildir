Greetings guys;
2 things of note, both of which have existed for a while.
1. My logs are sprinkled with:
Nov 19 09:55:53 coyote kernel: via82cxxx: timeout while reading AC97 
codec (0x9A0000)
Nov 19 09:57:18 coyote kernel: via82cxxx: timeout while reading AC97 
codec (0x9A0000)
Nov 19 10:42:15 coyote kernel: via82cxxx: timeout while reading AC97 
codec (0x9A0000)
mobo is a Biostar M7-VIB, about 2 years old, uses this chipset.  The 
onboard sound itself seems to be working pretty good, although a new 
mail message from kmail has locked up xmms's access to the audio 
system on several occasions.
2.  Since about 2.6.0-test9-mm2, I see that the cannaserver startup 
during the boot, or if I do a service canna restart, says it failed, 
but it does not, the chinese etc characters display just fine in the 
spam, and a ps -ea|grep canna says its running.
These aren't show-stoppers by any means.  Just something to file away 
in the trivia box, and fix when somebody stumbles over that code.
