Did you choose to make USB support a module?  If you said 'y' to USB
support, then you should have a 'y' option above.  However, you most
likely said 'm' for USB support so 'm' is all you can do for this
because it depends on it.  Had you said 'n' to USB support, you wouldn't
be able to select 'y' or 'm' for the above.
