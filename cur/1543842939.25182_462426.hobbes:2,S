Yes, the CPU can perfectly load it before the previous load, indeed. I'm
sure that wouldn't be powerpc specific. In this case, it would be a
speculative load (since there is a data dependency, thus you would think
it's ok, but it's not on CPUs that do speculative execution).

It's a "normal" case memory barrier in this case. Same as for SMP. Yup.
