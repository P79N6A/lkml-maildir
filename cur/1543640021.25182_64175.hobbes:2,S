There are some books about Linux on s390/zSeries that are supposed
to be kept up to date with each of our "code drops" that happen
about twice a year. There probably isn't that much reference
to "s390x" since that's not an official IBM marketing term, but 
still they'd have to be audited. OTOH, there are other far bigger
documentation changes for 2.6, so having only one architecture might 
actually save some duplicated work even for the documentation.

Ok. So what happens there if a user space program e.g. does #include
<asm/page.h>? Where does that go instead of /usr/include/asm/page.h?
