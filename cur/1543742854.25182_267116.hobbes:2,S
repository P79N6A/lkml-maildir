i've uploaded -V0.6.3 to the usual place:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
which fixes two issues:
 - priorities of SCHED_OTHER tasks not getting properly managed, hence 
   they could end up 'starving' other SCHED_OTHER tasks pretty
   indefinitely. This could possibly solve the 'temporary lockup'
   problem reported by Mark H Johnson.
 - fixed the 'high load average' bug
i dont know whether this will solve the 'hard lockups' reported though. 
It could solve your problem because the 'find /' kept running so it
wasnt a hard lockup. I'll keep testing and i'll fix any problem i can
reproduce myself.
