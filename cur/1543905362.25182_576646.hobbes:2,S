In pps_event() is not useful using spin_lock_irqsave/restore() since
the only difference between spin_lock_irqsave() and spin_lock() is
that the former will turn off interrupts if they are on, otherwise
does nothing (if we are already in an interrupt handler).
Maybe you meant I should using spin_lock_irqsave/restore() in user
context, but doing like this I will disable interrupts and I don't
wish doing it since, in this manner, the interrupt handler will be
delayed and the (probably) PPS event recording will be wrong. I
prefere loosing the event that registering it at delayed time.

Of course, I meant "protecting data". In fact to protect pps_source[]
I need spin_lock() to protect user context from interrupt context and
mutex to protect user context from itself.

I see. But consider pps_register_source(). This function should
provide protection of pps_source against both interrupt context
(pps_event()) and user context (maybe pps_unregister_source() or one
syscalls). Using only mutex is not possible, since we cannot use mutex
in interrupt context, and using only spin_locks is not possible since
in UP() they became void.
Can you please show me how I could write pps_register_source() in
order to be correct from your point of view?

That's the point. I don't wish using _irqsave/restore() since they may
delay interrupt handler execution. As above, I prefere loosing the
event then registering it at wrong time.

Why you wish using one lock per sources? Just one lock for the
list/array is not enought? :-o
