I am actually concerned about the following case:
The add_request ON CPU_1 function calls 
        spin_lock_irqsave(&io_request_lock,flags); 
Our I/O Function unlocks the spinlock and goes to sleep.
Finally, the add_request function, NOW ON CPU_2 calls
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&io_request_lock,flags);
and restores the flags of CPU_1 on CPU_2.    
What am I missing? Are the flags which we restore valid for all the CPU's the same?
