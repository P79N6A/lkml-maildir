Well you can read the Intel documentation if you want the whole story.
You can hardly expect a full introduction in the basics and then
subtle issues of TLB flushing in a quick email.  You asked about opinions 
and summaries and those you got.

It's called the "placebo effect" in the literature I believe.

speculate is the key word.

TLB flushing in virtualization works completely different. I doubt
it would be affected.
