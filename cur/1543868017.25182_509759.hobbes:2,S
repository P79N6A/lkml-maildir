sched_clock has the down side of not taking into account rollover .. The
scheduler doesn't care if it gets a few bad timestamps now and then, but
that might screw up other code..
Also you could read cycles , and then later convert to nanoseconds when
it's needed .. Which makes taking the timestamps a little faster.

Most of the clocksources are not per cpu .. But the tsc clocksource
doesn't keep any per cpu offset information. There has been some work on
syncing the TSC across cpus so I'm not sure to what extend an offset
would be needed.

yeah it is a little strange .

One reason I did it the other way is because it's easier to specify what
you know you don't want, than to specify all the things that you know
you do want.
Almost everyone would want every flags listed,
clocksource_get_clock_with_features(CLOCKSOURCE_PM_UNAFFECTED|CLOCKSOURCE_STABLE
|CLOCKSOURC_ATOMIC|CLOCKSOURCE_64BITS|CLOCKSOURCE_CONTINUOUS);
Gets pretty ugly .. The clocksource interface already has a positive
rating to describe the "best" clocks in the system, which is used to
return the "best" clock .. Where the maintainers of the system give each
clock a rating. I would imagine most people would just get the so called
"best" clock which has the best rating..
I'm starting to think this long flags stringing effect could happen with
negative flags also, but it's seems a lot less likely.

I might add a way to get specific flags, but I still think the flags
should be mostly negative features.

It means the clock uses an interrupt to extend it's precision, or it's
not a real cycle counter and depends only on an interrupt for timing.

PM_AFFECTED means it could become unstable, and CLOCKSOURC_UNSTABLE
means it's already become unstable.

It could .. The PIT clock for example takes a spinlock. Some users might
not want to use that clock cause they call from a context where that
isn't acceptable (LTT for example). It's also slower to read from.

There is a block notification system that lets you know when a clock
becomes unstable . cyc2ns doesn't compensate for frequency changes . The
TSC for example could fluctuate frequency pretty often. sched_clock for
example uses the clock no matter what the state is , which is why I
leave unstable clock in the list.

Yeah, thanks for the feedback .
