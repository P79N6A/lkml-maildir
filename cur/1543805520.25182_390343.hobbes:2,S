This patch doesn't work for arch/ia64/sn (probably not for ia64/hp either).
The final link fails:
---------------------
arch/ia64/sn/built-in.o(.init.text+0x1c90): In function `sn_setup':
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/setup.c:151: undefined reference to `nid_to_pxm_map'
arch/ia64/sn/built-in.o(.init.text+0x1c91):arch/ia64/sn/kernel/setup.c:155: undefined reference to `pxm_to_nid_map'
arch/ia64/sn/built-in.o(.init.text+0x1ca0):arch/ia64/sn/kernel/setup.c:151: undefined reference to `nid_to_pxm_map'
arch/ia64/sn/built-in.o(.init.text+0x1cb0):arch/ia64/sn/kernel/setup.c:155: undefined reference to `pxm_to_nid_map'
It looks like you removed the definitions of pxm_to_nid_map and nid_to_pxm_map,
but did not remove all the uses.  I recommend when removing global kernel
symbols that one grep all the kernel files for other uses.
A grep of the kernel (in Andrew's 2.6.16-rc1-mm3 quilt stack, just
after this patch and its first fix are applied) shows:
$ grep -rEIw pxm_to_nid_map\|nid_to_pxm_map * | grep -vE patches\|System.map
arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:        u8 nid_to_pxm_map[MAX_NUMNODES];/* logical node ID to _PXM map */
arch/ia64/hp/common/sba_iommu.c:        node = pxm_to_nid_map[pxm];
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/setup.c:    nid = pxm_to_nid_map[pxm];
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/setup.c:            nasid = pxm_to_nasid(nid_to_pxm_map[node]);
include/asm-ia64/acpi.h:extern int __devinitdata pxm_to_nid_map[MAX_PXM_DOMAINS];
include/asm-ia64/acpi.h:extern int __initdata nid_to_pxm_map[MAX_NUMNODES];
From the above, I presume that arch/ia64/hp is broken, along with
arch/ia64/sn.  And it looks like the nid_to_pxm_map[] in srat.c
is a waste of stack space, and the two remaining externs in
asm-ia64/acpi.h should be removed.
