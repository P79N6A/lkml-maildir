Hi,
	You patch is OK.  Just two minor comments:
1) make the enable_write_allocate an _initfunc so that the code is
discarded after boot and doesn't bloat other people's kernels (who may not
have an AMD).
2) Move the code to the amd_model function.  Although currently that
function is misnamed, since it's used for the Cyrix MediaGX detection too.
Probably separate the extended cpuid part, from the real AMD specific
part.  That will save some branch code (for what that may be worth).
	Cheers,
		Rafael
