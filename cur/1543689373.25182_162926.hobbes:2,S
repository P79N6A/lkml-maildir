Felipe, 
Just had a quick look at it. A couple of thoughts:        
* mc32_interrupt doesn't acquire the spinlock, rendering the critical
  sections un-exclusive on SMP. 
* sleep_on's remain in mc32_halt_transceiver and mc32_close. I think this 
  could lead to deadlock on UP --- eg. thread sleeps with spinlock held,
  subsequent interrupt then waits in vain. Might be less deadly on SMP?
  (are interrupt handlers reentrant on SMP?) 
* Just noticed an old error in mc32_close --- sleep_on is called in
  without first disabling interrupts. 
I've had a go at testing it, but ran into troubles with the ibmmca.c
driver carking on an uninitialised spinlock. Hopefully, I'll find some
quality time in the weekend to get things going. 
best, 
Richard.
