I think the question at the core of it all is, shall a pathname based security 
mechanism be allowed. I was under the impression that this question had 
already been answered affirmatively. If the answer here was no, then we could 
stop the entire discussion right there.

Audit and inotify don't make any decisions based on pathnames, or on SELinux 
labels for that matter, they only report. That being said, sure those parts 
of the kernel that report pathnames should report them correctly -- I guess 
there is no disagreement about that.

Without the vfsmounts propagated down you won't know the pathnames. Whether 
or not a different problem can be solved without the vfsmounts is not really 
relevant.
Thanks,
