Dear Friend.
I am  Abdul Raham,A merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirate.
I have been
diagnised with Cancer, which was discovered very late, due
to my laxity
in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of
medicine; Right 
now I have only about a few months to live, according to my
Medical Doctor. I 
have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never 
really cared for 
myself but the oil business.
Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused
on my
business as that was the only  thing I cared for. But now I
regret all 
this as I now know that there is more to life than just 
wanting to have or make 
all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a
second chance and
heal me I would live my life a different way from how I have
lived it.
I have sowed a seed for my healing I have willed and given
most of my
properties and assets to my immediate and extended family
members and
as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to
me and 
accept my soul and so,I have decided to give arms to charity
organizations 
and give succor and comfort to the less privileged of the
Tsunami Victims, 
as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on
earth so far, by
distributed some of this money to some charity organizations
in India 
and Malaysia.
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do
this my self
anymore.I once asked members of my family to close one of my
accounts
in Saudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to
charity
organization and to the less privileged in Bulgaria and
Sudan Africa
They cashed the money but kept it only to themselves.
Hence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be
contended with
what I have left for them already. The last of my money,
which no one 
knows of,is the huge cash deposit of twenty two million
dollars $ 22 million 
that I have in the Vault of The Company in Europe as family
valuable
since the year 2003 for safekeeping.
I want you to collect this deposit on my behalf  and
disburse it to
the Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia for the less
priviledged. Please
send me a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in this
disbursement.
You will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts.I
need your
urgentreply with your full name and address, age and
occupation,marital status
Phone/Fax Number,so that I will not have to go on sourcing
for a 
credible person to handle this project for himself and the
rest of the world.
God bless you.
 Abdul Raham
