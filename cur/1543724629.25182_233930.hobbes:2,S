I'm seeing PCMCIA Cisco Aironet 350 funnies that have been
verified on two different cards on two different laptops running FC2
both the stock FC2 kernels and with 2.6.7-mm[567].
The two funnies I'm seeing:
* Running "iwconfig eth1 mode Managed" *before* setting the ESSID and
wep key results in an inability to associate. If that command isn't run,
then everything is OK.
* Doing a insert/eject loop, and running "iwconfig eth1" after each
insert will quickly result in a hang (and unkillable state) of the
iwconfig command.
