The patch below fixes the problem for ia64 and should have no effect
on x86 or x86-64.  Just out of paranoia, I compiled-tested it on x86.
If it looks OK, please apply, Linus or Andrew.
Thanks,

Make get_user_pages() work again for ia64 gate area
Changeset
  roland@redhat.com[torvalds]|ChangeSet|20040624165002|30880
inadvertently broke ia64 because the patch assumed that pgd_offset_k()
is just an optimization of pgd_offset(), which it is not.  This patch
fixes the problem by introducing pgd_offset_gate().  On architectures
on which the gate area lives in the user's address-space, this should
be aliased to pgd_offset() and on architectures on which the gate area
lives in the kernel-mapped segment, this should be aliased to
pgd_offset_k().
This bug was found and tracked down by Peter Chubb.
