Rainer, you missed the point. Nobody cares about small things
such as "cannot start nfsd" while your 4096 mounts patch
simply CORRUPTS YOUR DATA TO HELL.
If you need more than 1200 mounts, you have to add more majors
to my patch. There is a number of them between 115 and 198.
I suspect scalability problems may become evident
with this approach, but it will work.
Trond asked if I requested numbers from HPA, and the answer is no,
because I wanted the patch in circulation for a while before it
is worth bothering. Also, I heard that LANA is closed anyways.
