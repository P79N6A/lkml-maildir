Suggest you use msync(MS_ASYNC), then
sync_file_range(SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE|SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE).
The new (post 2.6.17) MAP_SHARED dirty-page semantics mean that the msync()
isn't actually needed.

We can fix your application, and we'll break someone else's.
I don't think it's solveable, really - the range of applications is so
broad, and the "standard" is so vague as to be useless.  This is why we've
been extending these things with linux-specific goodies which permit
applications to actually tell the kernel what they want to be done in a
more finely-grained fashion.
