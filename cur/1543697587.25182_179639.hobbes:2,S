I compiled without PREEMPT and first it seemed good. I could compile again a kernel without problem.
But later, I got the same oops when doing something else
(like `./configure` in parallele with a `make install` on other tty) so CONFIG_PREEMPT doesn't seem to be the cause, unfortunately, but a parameter than can affect the probability of getting the oops.

This seems to solve the problem, no oops during kernel compilation. Unfortunately, considering what I wrote just above, I'm not so sure it's really solved. Now I will use the 2.6.0-test10 and make again tests (alone, with this patch, with PREEMPT_CONFIG=n)

Well, cheap mainboard (VIA K7S5A) with cheap BIOS. I can only {en,dis}able cache L1/L2, nothing about ECC. DRAM is set to safe.
But as I said, I got no problem with 2.6.0-test9 vanilla. I compiled all my LFS/BLFS with it during several days.
I even use it these days as rescue kernel to compile the others.
Thanks for your help,
