I can see explanations in case 2.2.7 assigns your disk a geometry
different from that invented by 2.2.5.
So that is my first question: what geometry do both kernels assign to your
boot disk? (Look at the boot messages.)
(And if that is not the explanation, then you might add some miscellaneous
useful info: does lilo.conf have the `linear' option? is this a scsi or an ide disk?
If scsi, then what controller?)
