Geert, did you intend to include this part?
This part needs an update of all archs includes (to define 
flush_icache_user_page at least as flush_icache_user_range) and the 
changes to binfmt_{elf,aout}.c are part of this patch.
Maybe I should explain the reason behind this patch:
The actual problem is the usage of flush_icache_range(). In 
kernel/module.c it's used to flush data from the kernel cache, in 
binfmt_{elf,aout}.c it's used to flush data from the user cache and in 
both situations it's called with a user space context, so that 
flush_icache_range() doesn't know which cache to flush and I'd really 
like to avoid having to flush both caches.
So the full patch renames flush_icache_range() in binfmt_{elf,aout}.c into 
flush_icache_user_range(), but which already exists, so I renamed this 
into flush_icache_user_page().
bye, Roman
