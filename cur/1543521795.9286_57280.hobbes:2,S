I don't know:
you improve the compile speed at the cost of the runtime performance (ie
image size):
* a real function would reduce the compile time _if_ you change
CONFIG_KMOD.
* a define would reduce the image size. This might be a disadvantage for
an embedded systems.
I usually don't care about the compile time [coffee break], esp. since
changing CONFIG_KMOD seems rare. The final result is more important.
