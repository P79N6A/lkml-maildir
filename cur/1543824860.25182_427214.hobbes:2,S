I dont see how slab object reuse could cause leak detection problems - 
if something _is_ being freed, it's not a leak. What matters are the 
objects that are 'forgotten' - and (at least statistically) kmemleak 
should find them, because after some time all references to them go 
away.
on 64-bit systems the statistical likelyhood of finding a leak could be 
even increased by artificially relocating the kernel to a semi-random 
base within the 64-bit address space. (that would mean that in practice 
that all kernel pointers would be 'marked' with the top 28-32 bits that 
are a good indicator of them being a kernel pointer)
