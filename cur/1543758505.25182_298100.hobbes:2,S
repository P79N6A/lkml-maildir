I'm not sure exactly what you want to have happen here.. if an 
application is making outbound connections it has to effectively use one 
interface or the other. If you want to switch between the two of them 
automatically, something like 
NetworkManager(
http://people.redhat.com/dcbw/NetworkManager/
) may work, 
however it's not going to be seamless (as in, preserving open 
connections), since the IP addresses are different..
