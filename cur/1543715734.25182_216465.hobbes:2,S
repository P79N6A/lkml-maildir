There was no conspiracy.  The patch was compiled and linked on three archs,
and ia64 was not one of them.  The #define of elf32_map contributed to
the obfuscation.

A proper fix might require help from an ia64 maintainer to define macros
IA32_ELF_PAGESTART, IA32_ELF_PAGEALIGN, IA32_ELF_PAGEOFFSET
and will require ia32_do_munmap().  Below is partial progress,
"completing the parallelogram" from fs/binfmt_elf.c via
arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32_binfmt.c and arch/s390/kernel/binfmt_elf32.c.
This patch requires an ia32_do_munmap().  Until then, Paul's change
is sufficient, and loses no functionality except when PT_LOADs from the
same file designate non-adjacent regions, which was part of the reason
for the bssprot* patch(es) anyway.
When applied after 2.6.6-rc2-mm2, this compiles with warning (no prototype
for ia32_do_munmap), does not link (ia32_do_munmap is undefined), and
has not been executed.
