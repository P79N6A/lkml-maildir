Hi all,
I am having some problems getting pcmcia working on a laptop  The system is 
an Averatec (formerly Sotec) and has an O2Micro 6912 card controller.  I 
have successfully installed RedHat 8.0 and have installed kernel version 
2.4.18-27.8.0.  Everything seems to work fine, except that when I boot the 
machine, it stops at "Starting pcmcia" for about 5 to 10 minutes.  A check 
of the logs shows no errors. In addition, when I insert a pcmcia card, the 
system hangs for a couple of minutes, then seems fine after that. I have 
tried using the standalone pcmcia drivers, in hopes that would solve my 
problem, but after posting on the forum I was told by David Hinds that I 
should be using yenta_socket.  He suggested I post a message on this list 
to see if anyone has any suggestions.
If you could please CC me on any responses, I would appreciate it.  I would 
subscribe to the list, but I'm afraid I would just be in over my head.  :)
Thanks in advance,
Steve
