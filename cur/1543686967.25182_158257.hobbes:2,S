In 2.6.0-test3:
linux/drivers/ide/legacy/ide-cs.c:
	static dev_info_t dev_info = "ide-cs";
In 2.4.21:
linux/drivers/ide/legacy/ide-cs.c
	static dev_info_t dev_info = "ide-cs";
The pcmcia-cs package may have ide-cs called ide_cs though.

The output of lsmod can be confusing.  '-' is replaced by '_' in the
module name.  This doesn't affect module binding, loading or unloading.
You can still rmmod ide-cs even if it's called ide_cs.
In either case, this is what should be in /etc/pcmcia/config:
device "ide-cs"
  class "ide" module "ide-cs"
pcmcia-cs 3.1.24 ships with:
device "ide_cs"
  class "ide" module "ide_cs"
which is wrong for the kernels ide-cs implementation.
The first line contains the device name, and is also the name used to
bind the driver to the device.  (this is referenced by the "bind"
statements in the "card" sections.)  The second line contains the
module name(s) to load.
