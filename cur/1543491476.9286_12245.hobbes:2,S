Why? This must be a misconfiguration of color-ls. IIRC color-ls should
output color to a tty _only_ by default, and normal output goes to pipes
unless you force it to output color always. At least the color-ls that I
use on my RH 5.2 system behaves so.
The patch itself seems to be a good thing - one less thing to depend on.
