It works fine. Its an advisory exclusive locking scheme which is
precisely what is needed and precisely how some vendors implement their
solution.
There are good reasons for not having absolute locks, one of which is
that you might want to force a reset or a hot unplug of an interface
knowing you'll lose the CD its burning (eg because your flight is about
to leave)
