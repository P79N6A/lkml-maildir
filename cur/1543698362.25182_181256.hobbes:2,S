Im willing to solve it another way: There is a patch around (included in the 
mm paches) for the kernel wich introduces a ACPI timer (timesource). As im 
successfully using ACPI here ill switch over to it. A collegue of mine (who 
had equal problems) reportet that this driver solves the problem completly.
About your patches: I would surely test your patches... i think its necessray 
to have a good bug less standard implementation  of the timesource.
BTW: The time screw was huge. Especially if i ran programms wich needed all 
the recources avalible (while(1){}).
cheers,
Raffaele
