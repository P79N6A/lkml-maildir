Well, that would be overkill, but iterating across, say,
/sys/class/scsi_device seems like it would be a good idea.
(I doubt libscg would ever be interested in the stuff in most of the
other directories: things like /dev/mem are not SCSI devices and never
will be, and /sys/class/scsi_device contains *everything* Linux
considers a SCSI device, no matter what transport it is on, SATA and
all. However, I don't know if it handles IDE devices that you can SG_IO
to because I don't have any such here. Anyone know?)
