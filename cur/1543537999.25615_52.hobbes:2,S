As I mentioned in Patch #2, I don't think this is a great idea
either... because the extra buffers would rarely be used and it doesn't
fix the recursion stemming from the vsprintf...  Also, it would probably
be a bad thing to start doing this with "buf" because then you could argue
that it should be done for _ALL_ static buffers... :)
Of course, on a NUMA machine with lots of memory... _THAT_ might not be
such a bad idea either... ;)
