Not quite, I can simply mmap on a hugetlbfs backed file to get hugetlb
pages.  File expansion is transparent.  It gets even trickier with file
that has holes in it.
I can do:
	fd = open("/mnt/htlb/myhtlbfile", O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0755);
	mmap(..., fd, offset);
Accounting didn't happen in this case, (grep Huge /proc/meminfo):
HugePages_Total:    10
HugePages_Free:      9
Hugepagesize:    262144 kB
HugeCommitted_AS:     0 kB
Now if I remove the file "myhtlbfile", accounting is done for inode
removal and hugetlb_committed_space underflows.
HugePages_Total:    10
HugePages_Free:     10
Hugepagesize:    262144 kB
HugeCommitted_AS: 18446744073709289472 kB
