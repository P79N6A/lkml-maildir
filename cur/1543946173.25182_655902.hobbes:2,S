I've posted a series of patches that I believe address Andi's concerns
about syncookies not supporting valuable tcp options (primarily SACK,
and window scaling).  The premise being if the client support tcp
timestamps we can encode the additional tcp options in the initial
timestamp we send back to the client, and they will be echo'd back to us
in the ack.  Anyone interested have a look, and provide any suggestions
you may have.  The new patches are a superset of this patch, so if they
are accepted this is one obsolete.
