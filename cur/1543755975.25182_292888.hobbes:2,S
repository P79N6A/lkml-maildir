This is just a chime in to let people know others are seeing problems
with USB/SCSI external enclosures.
I haven't tried lately, but my USB/FireWire enclosure never worked
with Linux (or WinNT under firewire, sigh...) so I haven't touched it
in months.  Money down the drain.

I should try it again and see how it works under USB/Firewire, my last
attempts were under 2.6.[78] or so time frame.
