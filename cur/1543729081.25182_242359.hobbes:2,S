Ingo mentioned that possibly the mlockall issue resulted from both
processes mapping some of the same pages, which was ruled out by using
small test programs, but maybe that is what is going on here.  A jack
client and server by definition have to map some of the same pages.
Would it be worthwhile to compile the jack client -static?
