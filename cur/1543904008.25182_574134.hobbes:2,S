Needed this warning fix:
fs/exec.c: In function 'do_coredump':

which makes me worry about how much care was taken here on 32/64 issues,
and crsos-arch issues (the underlying type for compat_ulong_t, for one).
Could you please go over it with a toothcomb, see if there are any other
slipups there?
Thanks.
