Subject: [PATCH] disable sched domains debug for 2.6.9
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Linus, can you please apply this to the BK tree prior to 2.6.9?  Nick's 
already ok'd it.
This patch disables the sched domains debug code, which has a tendency to 
print out a *lot* of information.  It's helpful for debugging, but a bit 
overboard for general use.  Also, if you have a high NR_CPUS value, it tends 
to scare people and overflow the dmesg buffer.
