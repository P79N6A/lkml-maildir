Hm.  I'm not a fan of the great big monolithic patch myself, but on the
other hand I don't like the idea of patches which are not self-contained
steps from working->working state.  Xen-core.patch is currently the
(more or less) minimal set of stuff which needs to be in place to get
working Xen guest up, and so from that perspective I don't think there's
a good way of splitting it up.

issues with it.  I noticed you didn't take paravirt-sched_clock.

I just rebased onto your newest patches, so I'll address your comments
