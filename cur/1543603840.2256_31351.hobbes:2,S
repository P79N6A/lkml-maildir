It may not be your MB or drive, but an interaction between them.
I.E. Your bios could've told the linux driver to use a higher dma level than
the drive likes.
Try running "hdparm -d0 /dev/hda" (since your drive is hda in this case...)
And see if the problem goes away.  If it does, then try Multimode dma, if
(-X34)
you get errors, try single mode (probably -X31), if you get no errors there,
try UDMA mode 2 (-X66, also make sure you have a 80 line ide cable) and see
if any of the problems come back.

Again, sorry for being presumptuous.  I've only been able to cause this with
hdparm.  Maybe I'm just not using new enough hardware...
