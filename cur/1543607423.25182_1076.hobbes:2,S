Hi all,
the HPT 1.25 bios seems to be buggy and detects the 80 gig maxtors as 13 gigs. 
Kernel 2.4.9 reports the highpoint controller as dma disabled by bios and the 
drives get max. 2 megabytes/s speeds. Is there a way to get dma on? hdparm -d1 
just reports operation not permitted.
Please CC me!
Thanks!
