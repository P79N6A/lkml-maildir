No, the resume is done either in pcm_oss.c or by calling the resume
ioctl explicitly from ALSA-native apps later on.

There is no function such as snd_pcm_resume_pcm().
Maybe you can remove the calls of snd_pcm_suspend_all(),
snd_ac97_suspend() in suspend callback, and snd_ac97_resume() in
resume callback.
