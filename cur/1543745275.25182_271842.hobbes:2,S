Kernel supports/allows 'Z' or 'z'.
C99 spec defines 'z' only as a size_t format length modifier:
z   Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion 
specifier applies to a size_t or the corresponding signed integer type 
argument; or that a following n conversion specifier applies to a 
pointer to a signed integer type corresponding to size_t argument.
Anyway, I agree with Al.  Will you please change it to
'z' instead of 'Z'?
Thanks,
