The compiler doesn't know, where the binary runs later. Or do you mean,
that it has to insert some code that checks for the existance of these
instructions during program start? Ok that would be a solution, but how
do you do this for libraries that are not run in itself?

Maybe, ok. But why should such a mistake prevent me from workin with the
system when it could be easily catched? Ok, the emulation code may not
be easy, I dunno, but the infrastructure for emulation of instructions
is already there (FPU emulation). To say its the admins fault is easy
but the costs of automatically catching such errors are little in
respect of the benefit you get. A running system is always better than
a unusable one even if it was the admins fault.
