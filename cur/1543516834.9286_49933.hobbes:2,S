Guys,
Where do I find maximum file descriptors for a specific user (like user
nobody to run apache). Resources in our site for this specific user is
being exhausted when a lot of users logon to our website, so I am
looking for a way to increased a limit for this user.
Any feedback will be appreciated.
Thank you.
Alex
