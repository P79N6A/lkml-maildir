3c509-TPO, ca 1994 vintage, ethtool eth0 output:
Settings for eth0:
	Supported ports: [ TP AUI ]
	Supported link modes:   10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full 
	Supports auto-negotiation: No
	Advertised link modes:  Not reported
	Advertised auto-negotiation: No
	Speed: 10Mb/s
	Duplex: Half
	Port: Twisted Pair
	PHYAD: 0
	Transceiver: internal
	Auto-negotiation: off
	Current message level: 0x00000002 (2)
	Link detected: yes
So far so good (except it reports AUI although it has none).
Unfortunately, this simple query killed the link, and I had to
down/up eth0 to get it back.
Next I tried ethtool -s to change some settings (port, speed,
full duplex) and all returned errors. I kind of expected that.
Next I tried to rlogin to this box from another: complete kernel hang :-(
I may be able to test some more later this week, on a slightly newer
3c509(B?) TP/AUI combo NIC.
