Subject: [PATCH 0/7] kill __KERNEL_SYSCALLS__

Ok, next try. This time a full series that tries to kill
off __KERNEL_SYSCALLS__, _syscallX() and the global errno
for good.
Practically no testing so far, so please check if this
makes sense first before applying.
I'd especially like the arch maintainers to provide
better implementations of kernel_execve, since I had to
rely on the inline assembly provided from _syscall3 to
implement them instead of doing it the right way.
