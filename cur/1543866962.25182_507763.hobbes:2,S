I have the same problem since I made my desktop computer able to suspend 
again. As others in this thread said, grub replays all open transactions 
internally before accessing a file on an unclean reiserfs partition.
From some tests, 2.6.19(.x) seems to keep quite a bunch of open transactions 
even if I do multiple syncs just before a hard reset or echo 
>/proc/acpi/sleep on an idle system. I haven't verified against 2.6.18 yet, 
but there have been some non cosmetical reiserfs updates in 2.6.19. Anyone 
aware of a change that may cause this behaviour?
