I suspect something like that would be quite a lot of work to set up -
first-up one has to get all the patches to actually apply, and then work
through any compile-time interactions between them.   Dunno.
I don't like dropping patches.  Because then the thing needs to be fixed up
and resent and remerged and re-reviewed and rejects need to re-fixed-up and
this adds emailing overhead and 12-24 hour turnaround, etc.  I very much
prefer to hang onto the patch and get it fixed up.  This means that I
usually have to do the fixing-up.
And that's OK - it's one of the things I do.  But it's striking how silly
so many of these problems are - they demonstrate a very basic lack of care
and thought.
It's obvious that the originators haven't even compiled their feature with
its config option disabled, or they haven't spent the requisite 30
seconds thinking about their Kconfig dependencies, or they haven't verified
that all architectures support the architecture functions which they're
relying upon or they haven't grepped the tree for symbol clashes, etc.
So at this point in time what I'd like to do is to encourage developers to
do these very basic things.  That's the low-hanging fruit right now.
