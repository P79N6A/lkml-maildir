Vetoed, along with IS_RDONLY() prototype change.
Note that you are doing exactly the opposite of the changes we'll need
to deal with remount races.
What we need is to push readonly checks _up_ - into callers of fs methods.
vfs_permission() is default ->permission() - no more, no less.  Neither
it nor other instances have any business touching "this vfsmount is readonly"
logics - it's not something where fs can override stuff; it's "admin said
no r/w access here".
IOW, the check for r/w access to file/directory/symlink on a r/o mount should
be moved into the callers (very few of them) of ->permission() and away from
the methods themselves.
