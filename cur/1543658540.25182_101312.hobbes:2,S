I guess, depending on your definition of fundemental. I would put any
option which affects the kernel as a whole in that category, myself.
Compiling with frame pointers comes to mind, since every object file is
changed and there are performance implications as well.

Processor option would select the processor and any architecture dependent
options, I would think. Something like "kernel characteristics" could have
options like smp.
