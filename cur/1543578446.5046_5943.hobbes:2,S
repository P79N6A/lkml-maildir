Hello John,
This is really interesting. Great stuff.
As Alan had once suggested, it would be very interesting to have this
information correlated with the content of the traces collected using
the Linux Trace Toolkit (www.opersys.com/LTT). For instance, you could see
how many cache faults the read() or write() operation of your application
generated and other unique info. It would also be possible to enhance
the post-mortem analysis done by LTT to take in account this data.
You could also use LTT's dynamic event creation mechanism to log the
profiling data as part of the trace.
There are definitely opportunities for interfacing/integrating here.
Let me know what you think.
Best regards
Karim
