The program might hang, but the system shouldn't now: run 'dmsetup
info -c', look for devices with names ending in '-cow' that are in the
suspended state and run 'dmsetup resume' on them.

Upgrade!
Without the set of patches that included the one you identified,
whenever you ran 'lvcreate -s' the kernel was unable to give you any
guarantee the operation would succeed.  In the worst failure mode the
system would hang or oops, and the fix required this subtle interface
change.
