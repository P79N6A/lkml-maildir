OK, let's leave the test in place - filemap_sync() has global scope.

It works OK, but in practice makes little difference compared to MS_ASYNC.
We run out of request slots very easily with this sort of thing.
Another option would be to make MS_ASYNC behave the same as MS_SYNC,
which is probably better than just ignoring it as we do at present.
I'll leave it as shown above unless there be objections.

Whoop, thanks.  It was returning `err'.

Yup.  I've changed this part of the patch based on some discussion
with Trond.
I'll wait until Marcelo looks like he has his head above water and
then send out the final version of the ramdisk, truncate and
fsync/msync patches, cc'ed to yourself and lkml.
Thanks.
