Yes - and it has to be: we want to disable preemption and interrupts that 
can fault on the vmalloc space, until we've at least saved away %cr2. We 
had bugs in that area before.

I applied it as obviously correct.

Well, we *do* enable interrupts for real page faults anyway, and this 
whole code just triggers for the case where we'd send a SIGSEGV. If some 
silly app really thought it could do that with interrupts disabled, it was 
wrong before too (we'd hit a reschedule point and enable them there 
anyway).
