Hi,
	Some questions about ipip.c in 2.4.*:
	The following commands don't work anymore:
	   % ip tunnel add mode ipip .... (without giving a name)
	     (assume this creates tunl5)
	   % ip tunnel change tunl5 ....
	   ! ioctl error !
	   This happened on ipip.c version 1.42 and 1.46. The attached
	   patch fixed it in 1.46. Please modify the patch as you
	   see fits since I am not very familar with kernel mod.
	The other question is, is iproute2 considered part of the
	core Linux commands like ifconfig, route, etc.? It'd
	seem kind of stange that it wasn't. Or is there any plan
	to integrate the functionality of "ip" command into the likes
	of ifconfig?
	Thanks,
	yushun.
