Kconfig is a user interface, so perfect is what is best for the
kconfig users.

The first question is whether it's for actual SCSI hardware [1] or for 
the block layer functionality which the SCSI subsystem has become.
The mixture of these two is the root of much user confusion.
With the help text "The error messages regarding your SCSI hardware will 
be easier to understand if you say Y here" a user wouldn't have expected 
to see you using it in a firewire driver. But unless I miss anything, 
the setting of SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC does only affect "real" SCSI hardware.
If you check each option and place it either in the generic storage menu 
or the SCSI lowlevel menu this would fix much possible user confusion.
But these are relatively unimportant options compared to e.g.
USB_STORAGE=y, BLK_DEV_SD=n, which is a misconfiguration many
users run into, so having one menu somewhere with these advanced 
options should be enough.
