2.6.23-rc3-mm1: solid lock on X shutdown (noticed when upgrading)
      -rc4-mm1: solid lock on X shutdown, random solid locks about
                once every four hours
      -rc6-mm1: solid lock on X startup
   +your patch: screen goes black, turns off and on a few times during
                startup, can reboot with sysrq-b
