Hmm...possible. A quick check would be to reduce the frequency of exits 
and see.

Won't it suffice to make delivery of these stats best effort, with 
userspace dealing with missing data,
rather than risk delaying exits ? The cases where exits are so frequent 
as in this program should be
very few. Making the reception privileged would kind of constrain the 
utilization of stats and I'm not
sure if  its warranted.
