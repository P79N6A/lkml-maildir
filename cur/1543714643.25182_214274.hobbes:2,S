Subject: NFS export ... again

Trond, Chris,
     AFAICS, nfsd/export code already does some nfs cache poll through RPC to generate /proc/nfs/exports .... But content appears broken to me as it relates progressive mounting points but never umounts.We only have to fix this in my opinion ... or maybe I'm lured by multi-versioning there ... 
Regards,
Fabian
