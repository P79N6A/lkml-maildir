Good Day,
My randconfig just caught an error on:
kernel/built-in.o: In function `sysctl_check_lookup':
sysctl_check.c:(.text+0x17db1): undefined reference to `sysctl_head_next'
sysctl_check.c:(.text+0x17dc7): undefined reference to `sysctl_head_finish'
Git bisect was unsuccessful due to too many unrelated errors trying to
track down the issue. I also couldn't track down the offending
function. Any idea of the issue?
Against this config: 
http://avuton.googlepages.com/sysctl-head-next.config
git master: 4fa4d23fa20de67df919030c1216295664866ad7
Thanks,
