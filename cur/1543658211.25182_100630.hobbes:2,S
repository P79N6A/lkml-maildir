Hi again,
I discovered that if I renice the ksoftirqd processes to level 0, the 
performance was actually better with the NAPI enabled driver compared to 
the one without (as was intended my NAPI IIRC). With the default nice 
level (19) on the ksoftirqd processes, the performance on multithreaded 
programs was pretty lousy with the NAPI enabled driver.
Any reason why the ksoftirqd shouldn't be nice level 0 by default ? Is 
this already fixed in 2.4.21-pre series ?
