Ted,
I appreciate Alan and you doing the kernel Status/TODO lists,
but I think that you ought to simplify it for yourself at
least (not that this would help Linus) by having maintainers
do it instead of you do it.
I'm willing to do it for USB, but I'm not willing to duplicate
your work if you continue to do it.  I don't expect you to
know/understand all of the filesystem or I/O subsystem or
VM or process issues and be able to track them without asking
lots of questions.  (Maybe you do, but I don't think that should
be a requirement of the status-bot.)
You should roll up reports from maintainers for a summary
kernel status report.
~Randy
PS:  This is probably too good to be true and would require
the assistance of lots of maintainers, but that's how it
should be done IMO.
