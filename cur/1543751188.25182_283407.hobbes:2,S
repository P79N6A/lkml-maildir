We have a couple of mail-servers running first 2.6.9-1.681_FC3smp
and was later upgraded to the Fedora test kernel 2.6.10-1.727_FC3smp
which I think is pretty plain 2.6.10 + ac2. But they both keep
crashing with the message:
       Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempting to free lock with active block list
Any ideas how to attack this?
We're running Centos 3.3, ext3 for root-disks, ext2 on /boot,
XFS for mail-spools, lots of nfs-mounted directories..
