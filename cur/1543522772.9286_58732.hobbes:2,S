Well, it seems that it happens more and more with memory pressure, even
if that pressure is file cache (no writes) pressure.  This is the cut
out and then silence problem I spoke of earlier.
It seems that the IP stack about the same time goes nuts.  Sometimes it
takes 10 minutes to send or to register a recieve.  This is more likely
3-5 minutes but definitely a long time.
I have 128 meg of RAM and 128 meg of swap...
Again, 2.3.40pre6.
