This patch is incremental with VM-global, but that's
only because the Conectiva kernel RPM happens to
contain VM-global, not because I agree with all points
of VM-global (some of the changes seem a bit .. suspect).
Luckily my patch fixes some of the suspect areas in
VM-global and most of the other parts of VM-global make
a lot of sense. It's not perfect, but it should be good
enough for 2.2.
On whether any of these improvements are going into the
next 2.2, don't bother asking me since I have no intention
paying much attention to 2.2 and I was only needing it to
install a machine with ext3...
regards,
Rik
