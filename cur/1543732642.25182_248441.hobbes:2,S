  Indeed. I hope I didn't say otherwise :). Just that I think it will
  be very difficult to have this transparency in all apps. Just
  thinking of "nano file.jpg/description.txt" or "ls
  file.tar/untar/*.doc". Sure in some environments like Gnome it could
  work, but it still doesn't for the rest of the flora of Linux
  programs.
