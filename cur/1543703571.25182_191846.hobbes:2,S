Yeah, I saw that too.  Of course, it's not like that's my fault :-P  I
had the 2.4.9 version of the iorl patch before 2.5 had a host lock, so
2.5 *could* have followed the 2.4.9-iorl patch convention of using
host->lock as the name instead of host->host_lock and then we wouldn't
be here.  But, because 2.6 uses host->host_lock, and because usage of
the scsi_assign_lock() is discouraged, I made the iorl patch in RHEL3
follow the 2.6 convention of using host->host_lock.  In hindsight, I
should have just followed the 2.4.9-iorl patch convention.  Then a
driver could have just done this:
#ifdef SCSI_HAS_HOST_LOCK
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,0)
	adapter->lock_ptr = &adapter->lock;
	host->lock = &adapter->lock;
#else
	adapter->lock_ptr = &adapter->lock;
	host->host_lock = &adapter->lock;
#endif
#else
	adapter->lock_ptr = &io_request_lock;
#endif
Then you just always use adapter->lock_ptr for spin locks in the driver
and you magically work in all kernel releases.  Now, by going to
host->host_lock in 2.4 we get rid of one of the if statements.  This
isn't impossible to do if both Red Hat and SuSE just release their next
update kernel with host->lock changed to host->host_lock.
