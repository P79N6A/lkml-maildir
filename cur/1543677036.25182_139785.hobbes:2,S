Won't that generate a warning about assigning a signed quantity
to an unsigned variable?
What's really needed is a set of definitions along the lines of
	#define MAX_U32	((__u32) 0xFFFFFFFFUL)
	#define MAX_U64	((__u64) 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL)
but as an intermediate measure, how about...
	__u64 uid = ((__u64) 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL);
Best wishes from Riley.
