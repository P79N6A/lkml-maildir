Doesn't that seem buglike to you?
Oh, right -- the module exit code will ignore that status, it doesn't
even have a way to report failures any more.  Crap.
So it looks like we have no choice but to do this.  Can you make sure
all the rmmod-capable gpio_chip drivers support this?  Ignore the SOC
support, that never supports rmmod -- just the stuff in drivers/gpio.

Right.  In fact, every time you'd expect driver removal errors to
cause module removal to fail.   Maybe this is part of that whole
"should we even *support* rmmod" discussion, which I tuned out.
