I have an "IBM-DPTA-353750", it reports CHS=7144/16/63. I found no BIOS that
would recognize this drive, they all hang. Only removing the drive from the
BIOS works.

The current LBA-detection assumes that all drives report 16383,16,63
physically, the Desktar definitly does not do so. Without LBA, this
behaviour is correct.
Try this patch against 2.2.12:

With this LBA-detection, you can change the geometry with fdisk to something
with 32 head and get LBA.  I get the geometry 38340/32/63.
Yes, I know, this patch is not perfect. But it works for me.

Okke.
