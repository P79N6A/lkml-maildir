Worried your drive will fill up?  The files copied to your
drive is merely copied as a "caching" operation.  They
still seem to reside at the server - this is totally transparent.
And of course you can limit this caching - if too many files
is cached some is simply thrown away.  (Or sent back
if they were changed.) They will be re-
loaded automatically if you ever need them again.
If you really want to store them where you want instead of
transparent access, why bother with a new FS at all?
(I believe coda lets you specify where the caching
will happen, if you have several partitions/drives)
Simply run a script that reserves the file (by using
the permission system) and *copy* it to
where you want.  Check-in will consist of copying
the altered file back, and restore normal permissions.
You might even want to run a system like CVS, unless
there is some special reason for not doing that.
