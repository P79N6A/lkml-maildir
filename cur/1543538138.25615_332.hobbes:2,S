Using 2.4.0test3 pre 2 I get a Kernel Panic message as it tries to mount
root.  Here are the messages that I get leading up to the error.
...
kmem_create: Forcing size word alignment - nfs_fh
EXT2-fs: unable to read superblock
Invaild session number or type of track
Invaild session number
isofs_read_superblock: bread failed, device 03:07, iso_blk_num=16,
block=32
Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:07
The drive is a 3.3G Maxtor.  If there's anything else that anyone needs,
just yell.  Sorry to bother everyone.
