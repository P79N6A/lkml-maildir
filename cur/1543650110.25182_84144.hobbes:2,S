The "huge disorganized heap 'o patches" thing was an attempt to get Rusty to 
post some kind of description or announcement for the patches (and I believe 
has been in the last three or four versions unchanged), but if those either 
aren't being pushed for 2.5, or he wants to do it himself and doesn't want 
them to be on my list, I'm fine with that...

The IBM guys asked me to put kprobes on my list.  The relationship between 
kprobes and dprobes is something I had to ask about two or three times before 
getting particularly clear on (since I don't use it), and what I have links 
to is what they told me.

I have yet to see Linus complain that a change has been been broken into too 
many pieces for him. :)
