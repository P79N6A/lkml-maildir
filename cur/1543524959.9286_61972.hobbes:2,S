     (digressing wildly)
     That's assuming that your system does (shudder) demand-loading
     of ethernet drivers.
     This is not always the case;  I put all the ethernet drivers into
     modules for Mastodon, but I load all of them when the system starts
     up so I can automatically detect eth0.  It's difficult to
     autodetect ethernet cards when you first have to know all the
     details about them.
