I might not be the best person to answer this, but this just seems so 
obvious:
If you plan to let a recently hot-unplugged device to be used in another 
OS that doesn't understand your journaling extensions, your disk will be 
corrupted.
If this is supposed to work only on OS's that understand your journaling 
extensions, then there are much better filesystems out there with 
journaling already.
You might be able to reduce the size of the time window where hot 
removing the media will cause problems, like writting all the data first 
and update the metadata in as few operations as possible. But that just 
reduces the probability of data corruption. It doesn't eliminate it at all.
