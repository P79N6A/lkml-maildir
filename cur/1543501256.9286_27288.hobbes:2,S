Hi,
I'm a new comer about Linux Kernel reading source code now.
The sk_buff is an important data structure for net implemenation. Even
though David has given some explanation of it in 'tlk-0.8',  I still
have some question:
What're sk_buff.h, sk_buff.data, sk_buff.ip_hdr, sk_buff.mac,
sk_buff.tail?
And the most important is where they point to in different protocol
layers?
