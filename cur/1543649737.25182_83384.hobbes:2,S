So there is. Darn. You could special case default_do_nmi, only printing
out "Unknown NMI" iff the reason inb() check fails, /and/ no previous
handlers set handled. Theoretically we have to take the cost of the
inb() every time otherwise we can lose one of the NMISC-based things in
default_do_nmi ... I can always see if this makes a noticable practical
difference for oprofile under high interrupt load
(I also need to be able to remove the NMI watchdog handler, but that's
an oprofile-specific problem).
Perhaps things will end being best to leave the current fast-path thing,
but we should make sure that we've explored the possibilities of
removing it first ;)
thanks
