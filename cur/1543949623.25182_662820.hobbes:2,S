The _core_ needs the window, not the driver.  Even if the driver discovers that
there are active children, it can only fail ->suspend(), in which the core will
faill the entire power state transition (unless we reserve an error code for
signaling such situations by ->suspend(), which I'd prefer to avoid).

Hm, I wonder why you didn't move dpm_sysfs_add() along with device_pm_add()?
Perhaps it's better to include dpm_sysfs_add() into device_pm_add(), since we
are going the make the return a result anyway?

It definitely would be simpler to assume so and introduce just one common
begin_sleep().

Well, I'm not sure.  Right now we have a problem with distinguishing drivers
that don't implement ->suspend() purposefully from the ones that just don't
support suspend/hibernation ...
OTOH, since we are going to have a pointer to 'struct pm_ops', we can safely
assume that if it's not NULL, the driver writer knows what he's doing.

But dev->parent will be not NULL for their children being on dpm_active ...
IMO it's simpler to just add those devices without any suspend callbacks
defined to dpm_active and handle them normally than to introduce a special
case.
