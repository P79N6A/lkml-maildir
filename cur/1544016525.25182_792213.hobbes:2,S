i dunno, why another fancy sysctl for something that fits quite nicely 
into the existing sched_features scheme that we've been using for such 
purposes for the past 3-4 kernel releases?
we always provided various toggles for new scheduler features via 
/sys/debug/sched_features, so that people can do performance regression 
testing, and it works quite well.
