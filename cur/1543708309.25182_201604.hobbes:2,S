2.6.3-bk6 hangs hard loading (binary) SmartLink winmodem module,
  and prints an assertion failure in
__journal_unfile_buffer() in jbd/transaction.c at line 1512
  jh->b_jlist < 8
Dead keyboard, can only keep power button pushed to power off.
I know - it's a binary module. The only reason I'm reporting this
  is that same module (2.9.6) works with earlier kernels such as
  2.6.3-rc3-bk1, and the assertion failure is in JBD which doesn't
  seem to have anything to do with the slamr.ko module but has at
  least very small changes in -bk6 that aren't in -bk4; so, it's a
  "just in case" the winmodem module happens to trigger an actual
  bug in the JBD code changes recently introduced.
I'll also report the issue to SmartLink - of course.
