I followed the start of this thread when it was about security mailing
lists and bug-disclosure rules, and then lost interest.
I just looked in again, and I seem to be seeing discussion of merging
grsecurity pathes into mainline.  I haven't yet found an message
where this is proposed explicitly, so if I am inferring incorrectly,
I apologize.  (And you can ignore the rest of this missive.)
However, I did look carefully at an earlier patch that claimed to be a
Linux port of some OpenBSD networking randomization code, ostensibly to
make packet-guessing attacks more difficult.

It was further claimed that this code came via grsecurity.  I did verify
that the code looked a lot like pieces of OpenBSD, but didn't look at
grsecurity at all.
However, I did look in some detail at the code itself.
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-netdev&m=110736479712671
What I concluded was that it was broken beyond belief, and the effect
on the networking code varied from (due to putting the IP ID generation
code in the wrong place) wasting a lot of time randomizing a number that
could be a constant zero if not for working around a bug in Microsoft's
PPP stack, to (RPC XID generation) severe protocol violation.
Not to mention race conditions out the wazoo due to porting 
single-threaded code.
After careful review, I couldn't find a single redeeming feature, or
even a good idea that was merely implemented badly.  See the posting
for details and more colorful criticism.
Now, as I said, I have *not* gone to the trouble of seeing if this patch
really did come from grsecurity, or if it was horribly damaged in the
process of splitting it out.  So I may be unfairly blaming grsecurity,
but I didn't feel like seeking out more horrible code to torture my
sanity with.
My personal, judgemental opinion was that if that was typical of
grsecurity, it's a festering pile of pus that I'm not going to let
anywhere near my kernel, thank you very much.
But to the extent that this excerpt constitutes reasonable grounds for
suspicion, I would like to recommend a particularly careful review of any
grsecurity patches.  In addition to Linus' dislike of monolithic patches.
Just my $0.02.
