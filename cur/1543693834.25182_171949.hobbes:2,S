Thanks for spotting this, although I don't know what has gone wrong here 
yet. (I don't know the DVB net code very well).
I'll review this, have a talk with the original author and then send an 
update patch.
Unfortunately, I don't notice every patch that goes directly into 2.6 
without getting postet on the linux-dvb mailinglist. Now if someone 
changes stuff in our CVS in the same file, it can happen that the stuff 
from the kernel is wiped out.
CU
Michael.
