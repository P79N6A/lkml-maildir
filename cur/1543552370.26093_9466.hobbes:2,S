I personally think the system timer is already an ugly hack. HZ is
arbitrary, slow by modern standards, and introduces latency.
As the comment you quoted points out, it's also not very accurate.  
Much better would be an agenda structure with one shot timers between
events and jiffies based on cycle counters. This works on modern hardware
and scales well for higher processor speeds. 
As for the current inaccuracy, the jitter introduced by using an error
term can never be more than a single real interrupt cycle, which is
already well below the average userspace latency.
