We can imagine that this bit is writable, but set to 0 on reset and then
the PCI BIOS will consider the device needs a memory mapped window, and, 
for obscure reasons, this bit has just been written to 1 by some other
piece of code. (Just some guessing perhaps quite wrong). Anyway, the PCI
specs 2.1 says that this bit must be hardwired.

How much are you sure that other systems, that donnot have this problem,
use same pieces of hardware of same revision?

If you can do that, then, I will recommend you to do at least:
- Read this base address register
- Warn if any of bit 1, 2 or 3 is set.
- Mask all the bits that should have read zero (bit 0,1,2,3)
- Rewrite this base address register
- Read it again and warn if any bit 0, 1, 2 or 3 is still set.

Normally, only the device driver has to access the device.

Normally, the PCI BIOS must have assigned to PCI devices all needed
resources prior to allowing to boot the machine. So, we should never need
to change any of the base address registers at boot. :) 
What you may want to check could be that the resulted memory mapped 
window after the fix-up of bit 0 is not already allocated to another
device, or maps real memory.
