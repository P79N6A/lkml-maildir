     Linux job accounting will be demo'd at the SGI booth
next week at SuperComputing 2000 in Dallas.  I think 
the SGI and LANL lawyers are down to the last legal issue
to be resolved, and then the source will be available at
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/csa.
     We've got some testing to complete yet.  All of the
commands are ported, new i/o counters added to the kernel,
and disk accounting, daily and periodic reports are being
created.
     The demo systems are based off of linux 2.4.0-test7 with
patches for the job infrastructure and csa code.  Almost all of
the job accounting kernel work is done in a loadable module, so
the other kernel changes are small.
