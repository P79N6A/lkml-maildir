Yes, Ted said the same.
A minor question is whether to cap it at 65536 blocks/group or 65528?
(The number of blocks per group must be a multiple of 8).
The current layout is such that you will _always_ have at least 3
blocks in use for each group.  However, if we implement Ted's
"metagroup" layout (which puts all of a group's bitmaps/itable blocks
in the first group of its block of group descriptors) then there could
be cases where a group has no blocks in use, and the free count will
overflow.
Having the upper limit at 65536 is aesthetically pleasing, and it aligns
nicely with LVM (which allocates chunks in power-of-two sizes), but may
preclude changing such a filesystem to the metagroup layout without a
larger effort on the resizer's part.  I'll go with 65528 I guess.
Note that going to a metagroup layout would also grow the distance
between the itable and possible blocks quadratically (the number of
group descriptors that fit into a block also grows with blocksize),
but at least it is not cubic growth.  That said, the metagroup layout
is probably only useful for cases where you _know_ you want huge files
(in the multi-GB range) and locality of blocks to the single inode block
is irrelevant.
Cheers, Andreas
