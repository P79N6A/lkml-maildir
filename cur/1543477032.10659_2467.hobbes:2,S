Hello everybody.
When receiving KISS frames on a cyclades under 2.2.0-pre4, the AX.25 frames
are corrupted (invalid CRC in xpb from various microsats - didn't test
anything else).
receiving KISS frames from /dev/ttyS* (instead of /dev/ttyC*) works perfectly
receiving PPP frames from /dev/ttyC* (instead of KISS frames) works perfectly
Running 2.0.35 (instead of 2.2.0-pre4) also solves the problem
minicom and other serial apps on /dev/ttyC* are ok, too
Looks like a problem between cyclades.o, mkiss.o, and probably af_packet.o.
BTW, all three are loaded as modules.
Any idea?
If you need more info, please tell me.
Thanks
-Klaus
