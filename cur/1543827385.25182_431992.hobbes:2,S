Subject: [patch] ICH7 SCI_EN quirk required for Macbook

Hello
((apologies to everyone receiving this for a second time -- I messed up
the original posting quite badly by mailing to the wrong place))
I've been working on getting my Macbook to sleep and wake up properly
lately.  This email directly follows my earlier posting to the
linux-acpi list on the same subject ::
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-acpi&m=114957637501557&w=2
The problem is that on resume the SCI_EN bit of the hardware power
management control register is not set.  This causes an endless stream
of unacknowledged IRQ9s.  This causes the kernel to ignore IRQ9 and
prevents ACPI from working.
Fixing the problem is as simple as re-enabling the SCI_EN bit early in
the resume process (before IRQs are enabled).
To this end,  I've written a patch that enables the SCI_EN bit soon
after resume on machines that need it (I do it for all ICH7-based Intel
Apple machines since an email from Frederic Riss tells me that he has
similar problems with his Mac Mini and my hack fixed it for him too).
Cheers
-------
This patch enables the SCI_EN bit on return from sleep on Intel-based
Apple machines with the ICH7 chipset (where for some reason this bit
gets disabled by sleep).  This is required to prevent an endless stream
of unacknowledged IRQ9s.
