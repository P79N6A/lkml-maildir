Obviously you didn't hear about the secure network being hit by the "I love 
you" virus.
The Navy doesn't INTEND to have any secure systems connected to a network to 
which any hackers could connect.
Unfortunately, there will ALWAYS be a path, either direct, or indirect between
the secure net and the internet.
The problem exists. The only to protect is to apply layers of protection.
And covering the possible unknown errors is a good way to add protection.
