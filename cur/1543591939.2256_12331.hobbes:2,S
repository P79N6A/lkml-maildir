ok, to using mod_timer we must hace already used one time  add_timer ?

So I've succeed to use a timer but with the struct timer_list.
I've found some example in rubini's book [oreilly], but I'm not sure
if the declaration of timer must be global ?
e.g If I do a timer call in a local function, whith a timer_list struct 
local, and when the scheduler handle the timer interrupt although I am
already out of local function... what's happen (oops ?)
And also I want to ensure that I can put whatever I want in the data
field.
thanks for all your advices.
