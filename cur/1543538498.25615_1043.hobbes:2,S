If I recall correctly, the 7msecs was due to starting the X server, and
to switching consoles.
I'll do some more tests, but the point I'm trying to get across is this:
It's no good testing it with my workload!  It has to be tested with
yours.  So please, get down and get testing. There isn't a lot of time.

This problem (deleting large files) is quite illustrative.
In kernel 2.2, this code path was a globally locked monolith, and Ingo's
conditional_reschedule() fitted in quite nicely.
In kernel 2.4, much finer SMP granularity has been introduced, so these
code paths are now bristling with spinlocks.  Consequently the 2.2
reschedule would deadlock in 2.4.  One approach would be to open the
locks, reschedule and close them again at select points.  That's
downright scary, and definitely on the wrong side of the dividing line
which (I hope) we have agreed upon here.
