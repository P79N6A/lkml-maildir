Err .. my mobo's BIOS is SMP specific and implements APM, so I guess
there is a case where it's useful. It must be something like when
running Win95, which is UP only. Isn't Linux able to return to a UP-like
state (à la Win95) just before entering poweroff ?
Or perhaps my first assumption is false: the APM implementation in my
BIOS just wastes some flash and never intended to be utilized.
