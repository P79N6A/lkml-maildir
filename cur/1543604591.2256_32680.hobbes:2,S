Not that it so far appears to be a problem, but where kapm-idled used
to wait a tad after activity and then apparently gobble up all the
extra CPU cycles (in 2.4.10-ac1) I now notice that xosview is showing
CPU usage when things are quiet as hopping up and down, and top is
reporting kapm-idled CPU usage as in the mid to high 50 percent range.
Under 2.4.10-ac1 top used to put kapm-idled in the very high 90
percent range.
Does this mean my laptop will get less battery life?
Thanks,
-kb, the Kent with too wimpy a battery as it is.
P.S.  I am on a Sony Viao PCG-Z505LE.
