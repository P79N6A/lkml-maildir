This will in most cases put an unreasonable burden on the network with
huge numbers of NFS_LOOKUP requests. Linus rejected a similar patch
around the pre-patch-2.2.8 series for this very reason. The current
code was the best compromise that could be reached. 
It will work quite reasonably for UNIX filesystems (except for entries
just below the mountpoint for which we currently have a small bug in
the updating of attributes), but may indeed be a problem for
VFAT-style filesystems that don't update directory mtimes.
Where are you BTW seeing persistent negative dentries? They should
never occur.
Cheers,
