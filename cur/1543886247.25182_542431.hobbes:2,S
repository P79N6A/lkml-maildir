Ah, yes so it did - damn browser caching....

Yeah, there's one extra filesystem block in the good case compared
to the broken case. If that was once good, then something has had to
truncate the file to remove that block....

Seems very unlikely. Have you unmounted and mounted the filesystem
(or rebooted or suspended) between the files being seen good and
the files being seen bad?

Ok, nothing unusual there.
