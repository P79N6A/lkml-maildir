So what are you arguing about burden ? It is a property of the
clocksource, that it is continuous, and not the other way round. It does
not matter how rare or desirable devices are.
What about the other bunch of useless defines:
+#define CLOCKSOURCE_NOT_ATOMIC         4
+#define CLOCKSOURCE_UNDER_32BITS       8
+#define CLOCKSOURCE_64BITS             16
Are those just for fun or are you actually putting the burden to get
them straight on the poor overworked clocksource developer ?
Also please define bit values as hexadecimal constants and not as
integers.
