Changes by more than x% compared to what?
The value at the time of the ioctl()? This might completely miss a
change that happened between the previous read() and the ioctl().
The value at the time of the last read()? Then the kernel
driver+infrastructure will need to keep track of the latest readout
done by each app. That's pretty heavy.
So what semantics make sense?
