Forgive my ignorance, but I have not seen a case up to today where ide, aicX or
3ware has called me up for a replacement unit, written to it and been ok
afterwards. What the heck are you talking of?
I am not really interested in what a low-level driver could do unless there is
none that does it...
And again, how do you think this should work out on your _root_ partition? (see
below)

I have yet to see an fs thats in a writeable state after the medium is full ...

How come?

Please tell me when you were last "paged to replace the disk"? If you can't
tell me, then you know I am right by now.
