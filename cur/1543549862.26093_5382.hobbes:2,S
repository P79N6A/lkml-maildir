Definitely.

I agree with you on that. I'd quite like a Win32 API to be available, but I
wouldn't like it to have too much impact on the main Linux kernel.
I presume that you don't have a problem with it implemented in a module for
use in accelerating Wine?

True the two are pretty much incompatible... but I can implement a large
amount of the basic Win32 API in kernel space without affecting on the rest of
the kernel.
I will, however, supply a couple of patches to add useful extra features that
are internal to the kernel anyway, and don't affect the userspace API
semantics. These include process death notification (which someone else
expressed interest in for some other purpose) and some optional hooks to make
it faster and easier to use my implementation.

Yes - written on the reverse of my cup mat *grin*.
