Can you explain why this class-based quiescing is good idea? It seems
to me that "quiesce this tree" is pretty much same as "suspend this
tree", and can be handled in the same way.
Nigel wanted to do class-based quiescing, but if we make quiescing
fast enough, it should be okay to do whole tree, always. (And I
believe quiescing *can* be fast enough).

BUG_ON() would be welcome, otherwise someone will get it wrong.
