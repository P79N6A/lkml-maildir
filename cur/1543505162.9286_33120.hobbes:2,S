Hello,
I have some questions regarding signal processing (via system calls in
i386 Linux).
* Is it necessary to return from a signal handler to the system, or is
it okay if control stays in my application?
* If control has to return to the kernel, is there a way to influence
what happens in the application *after* the signal handler has been
left?
