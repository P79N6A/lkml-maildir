The term "writeout event" hasn't been defined.  I assume that it refers to
something like "one call to balance_dirty_pages()".  Or maybe "one pass
through balance_dirty_pages()'s inner loop".  Or maybe something else. 
This is important, because the reader is already a bit lost.

In what units are "writebacks" measured?  Pages?

time is measured how?  jiffies?  Calls to balance_dirty_pages(), or passes
around its inner loop, or...

writes of what?  One page??
I think you get my point ;) Please start from the top.  Define terms before
using them, always specify in what units all things are being measured,
assume *no* prior knowledge apart from general kernel-fu.
