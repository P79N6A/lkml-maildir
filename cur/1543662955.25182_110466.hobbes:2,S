Basically, in a wait_for_reset, performance doesn't matter, so just 
flush with a read, and it will work in all cases :)
A PIO write may be posted through multiple levels of PCI bridges, 
perhaps... in any case, even if PIO is completely synchronous in test 
cases, an additional read will not hurt here.
