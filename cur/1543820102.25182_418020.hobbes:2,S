Yes, but please make it a common helper, since there is a real need
for it and code has to agree on the dirty hacks it uses :-)
static inline int rb_in_tree(const struct rb_node *node)
{
	return rb_parent(node) != node;
}
static inline void rb_set_off_tree(struct rb_node *node)
{
	rb_set_parent(node, node);
}
This is trivial, but gives semantics to those strange operations.
