Hm, I don't know any out-of-tree driver which is using it. Do you?
Besides, it is roughly equivalent to dvb_dmx_swfilter_packets(demux, buf, 1)
(the difference is in locking and the test for the MPEG-2 TS sync byte).
IMHO the EXPORT_SYMBOL for dvb_dmx_swfilter_packet() can be removed.
To me the patches look good and I'm going to apply them to linuxtv.org CVS.
Thanks,
Johannes
PS: The linuxtv.org server will be down for maintenance over the
weekend which includes the linux-dvb-maintainer list. No need to worry.
