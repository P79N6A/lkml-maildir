Tried 2.6.19-rc6-mm2. Now the problem is gone. Sometimes memory is 
getting maked used as before, but when the loss reaches a few MB's it is 
all freed. After 3 hours of X+all those scripts that cause leak + 
ThunderBird I can still shut down everything except a few processes and 
have only 50MB used. Script that demonstrated leak is now working 
without problems and without eating memory.
Thanks.
