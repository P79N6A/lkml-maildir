It is impossible to tell without more information.
Are these all open() for read, or are you mixing in other stuff like
O_CREAT, O_TRUNC and/or O_EXCL? All of those flags will have an impact
on the open() latency.
What is your expectation w.r.t. read cache misses? Is the read cache
always guaranteed to be cold on every call to read(), or is your test
cycling through the same data over and over again so that the caches are
kept hot?
