This would be an issue of consistency between a CPU and its TLB, so I 
doubt the usual self-consistency argument would hold. I would consider 
the TLB as logically external and separate from the core execution 
logic of the CPU. Of course it's an academic point either way since no 
PAE-capable x86 processor ever reorders stores to WB memory -- my 
original point was simply that smp_wmb() is a misleading name in this 
context, even barrier() would be clearer imo, but I'm in no way a Linux 
abstract memory model expert.
