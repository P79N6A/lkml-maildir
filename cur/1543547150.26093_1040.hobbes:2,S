This was taken out-of-context, and I'm afraid I have to admit that
it was me that did that. 
It's "make_rate", "r" is "rounding". "e" is "exponent". The "original"
and the routine that this is going to replace is indeed called
"make_rate".
It converts a 32bit "rate" (cells per second) into a 16-bit floating
point format, that is recommended by the ATM forum.
