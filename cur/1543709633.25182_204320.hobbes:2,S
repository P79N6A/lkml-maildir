Yup.

Didn't used to in SLES8 at least. maybe it does in 2.6 now, I know Andrew
worked on that a lot.

3 pages per task = 12K per task = 120,000Kb. Or that's the way I figured
it at least.

In 2.6, I think the task struct is outside the kernel stack either way.
Maybe you were pointing out something else? not sure.

Humpf. Do you have a hard figure on how much it actually is per cpu?

Yeah, that was a huge one we forgot ... sysfs. Particularly with large
numbers of disks, IIRC, though other resources might generate similar
issues.

That might be another approach, yes ... some more implicit allocation 
stuff would help here - modifying ISV apps is a PITA to get done, and 
takes *forever*. Adam wrote some patches that are sitting in my tree,
some of which were ported forward from SLES8. But then we get into
massive problems with them not being swappable, so you need capabilities,
etc, etc. Ugh.

You mean with the 8cpu box you mentioned above? Yes, probably 5K. Larger 
boxes will get progressively scarier ;-)
What scares me more is that we can sit playing counting games all day,
but there's always something we will forget. So I'm not keen on playing
brinkmanship games with customers systems ;-)
