This makes sense in a weird kind of way.

SCI interrupt routing?  I have tried with pci=routeirq and that hasn't 
helped either.  IRQ balancing perhaps?

That was with usb-handoff.  It also resulted in the black screen of 
bios-death upon reboot though :).

I'm missing something, I have USB1.1 compiled in, then why does the 
touchpad not work if it does the very same thing as usb-handoff?

That is correct.  It fails with timeout.  This for me confirms the fact 
that it is responding one command too late. aka, we send a command, it 
times out, we send another, it sends the result of the first.
Right, any new (or variations of existing ones) theories that I can try 
out to make this touchpad work correctly?  I can simply hack out the 
test for the touchpad but that doesn't solve the problem for others.
