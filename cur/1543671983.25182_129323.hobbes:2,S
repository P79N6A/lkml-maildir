I wask thinking that the PMD set in 4G mode was a noop.  But, it isn't,
so it makes up for the completely removed pgd set.
This comment needs to get updated in include/asm-i386/pgtable-2level.h:
/*
 * (pmds are folded into pgds so this doesn't get actually called,
 * but the define is needed for a generic inline function.)
 */
#define set_pmd(pmdptr, pmdval) (*(pmdptr) = pmdval)
#define set_pgd(pgdptr, pgdval) (*(pgdptr) = pgdval)
