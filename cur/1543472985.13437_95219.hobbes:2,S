That's right! Show benchmarks, and we'll beat the blue sky out of them by
careful use of an inlined RNG that _must_ beat the cost of doing a system
call + assorted data copies + the actual RNG work. Besides, a program where
the RNG is a significant fraction of the cost strikes me as quite odd...
The _only_ reason for /dev/{,u}random is as a (limited?) source of truly
random bits (AFAIU, the distribution isn't even known to be nice at all!)
