I'd rather see a whole new filesystem than have ext2 do tail-block
fragmentation. 
Once you do tail fragments, you might as well do the whole filesystem
over and have it do fancier stuff than just handling sub-blocking. 
Another way of saying this: if you go to the complexity of no longer
being a purely block-based filesystem, please go the whole way. Make the
thing be extent-based, and get away from the notion that you have to
allocate blocks one at a time. Make the blocksize something nice and
big, not just 4kB or 8kB or something.
And don't call it ext2.
