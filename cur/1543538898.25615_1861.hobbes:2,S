(Be gentle.  I not a kernel hacker.  Just someone that likes to stay
"current".  B-))
Twice now I've wound up with corrupted file systems, once with test3-pre7
and now with test4.  The corruption happens to all mounted (rw) filesystems.
I "think" it happens on shutdown since everything runs fine and the on next
boot the kernel basically say the root fs is *ucked.  B-)
I was able to recover most of my files the first time and hope I can this
time as well.  I'll leave one of the corrupted FSes alone for a bit in case
anyone needs more info.  I can even provide telnet/ftp access if needed.
What appears to be happening is that the data in the superblocks and bitmaps
get "shifted over/up" 2 bytes to the left (as viewed with a hex editor).
Here's a snippet of what the corrupted superblock looks like:

Here's one of the backup superblocks:

The bitmaps have the same kind of corruption.
Hollar if there's anything else I can provide.
