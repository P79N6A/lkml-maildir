Hardware is an early iBook (first gen - Clamshell)
with 2.6.0-test8, sound does not recover from sleep when an application 
is using it when the notebook is slept (can be reproduced: using pysol, 
with sound enabled, close the lid to sleep the laptop, then anytime 
after the sound stops (indicating that the laptop is sleeping) open the 
lid. Sound does not return, and the application does not close) The 
symptoms (indicated above) seem to point to the sound module (also when 
compiled into the kernel) hanging up on sleep. Sound hardware is 
pmac-dmasound.
two problems on the backlight (probably related):
the backlight control buttons do not work (the brightness of the 
backlight does not change) and when the laptop goes to sleep, the 
backlight does not turn off (it does turn off for console blanking as in 
when the unit is left idle for some time, and the screen goes blank).
I was unable to find any reference to this in the archives, so I'm not 
sure if this has been noticed yet.
