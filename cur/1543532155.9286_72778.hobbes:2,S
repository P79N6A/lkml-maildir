I quite disagree.  I use numerous [different] USB devices and I don't have
any problems at all.  On the contrary, without devfs I have the hassle of
figuring out which new mknod I need to update /dev.  With devfs I haven't
had to worry about anything.

I have the standard makecompat for devfsd.  I have -one- application which
breaks.  X.  Compiling a kernel with devfs and putting devfsd onto a machine
which was sans devfs is a breeze.  Compile, put devfsd and conf files on,
edit boot script.  Reboot.  All is well.

I find mounting over /dev more enjoyable, easier, and overall more
simplistic.
