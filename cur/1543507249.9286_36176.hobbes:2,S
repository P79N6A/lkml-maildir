Please correct if any of this is wrong.
There was a big change in buffer & cache handling in 2.3.7. (This
broke FAT too for a while.)  I believe the pending writes are
in "cache" instead of buffers now, the buffers are only used for
metadata.  So expect less buffers in use than before.
I don't know about the "shared" stuff, a problem with reporting
perhaps?  Shared memory still works...
