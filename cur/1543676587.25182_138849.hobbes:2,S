Another product from Linksys that runs linux is "EtherFast® Network Attached 
Storage." The firmware contains an ext2 image with some i386 binaries. It 
appears to be running 2.4.14-xfs (I did not locate the kernel, but the 
network module has it as a version.)
This is what I did:
unzip efg80.zip
mv EFG80_V10R33.bin EFG80_V10R33.bin.tar.gz
tar -xzf EFG80_V10R33.bin.tar.gz
cd rpm
mv system.img system.img.gz
gzip -df system.img
mount system.img /mnt -t ext2 -o loop
Jeff.
P.S. I did not check every document Linksys has about this product.
