As far as I know not all of the problems were fixed.  And it has been
observed that given the abuse and accusations that were directed at
the people who did decide to review it, that it would not at all
surprising if some (all?) of reviewers may have decided they had
better things to do.  Getting things merged into mainline is not a
right, and the reviewers are volunteers.....
Speaking for myself, since I don't enjoy being accused of partisanship
and being ascribed of having a desire to backstab reiserfs, I have a
personal policy to avoid reiserfs review, and recuse myself from any
votes within program committee discussions regarding Hans Reiser.
Being accused of taking unfair advantage of my volunteer activities is
something I allow myself to get into once.
