I'm having the same problem you described in your original message.  I
built 2.6.3-rc1 as you described here, ".config + a make oldconfig" but
arts dies with a message saying, "Sound server error, CPU overload".  I
click OK, but about 30 seconds later it says the same thing again.  This
is with KDE 3.2 all compiled from sources with GCC 3.3.2.  I boot under
2.6.2 and everything works well again.  I did notice that the sound
config file saved by doing "alsactl store" under 2.6.2 is not compatible
with that of the 2.6.3-rc1 kernel or versus.  If anyone else has any
ideas, I'm interested.  I was really hoping this kernel would solve some
issues I was seeing with 2.6.2.
Thanks,
Steve

Must be a known operator problem, I just rebuilt it from the 
2.6.2 .config + a make oldconfig, and its all working again.
