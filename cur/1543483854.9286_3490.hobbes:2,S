I say the only sensible reason to have it in or not is to look at other *nix
vendors if it is not specified in any of the multiple standards and see what
they do.  Linux is not a router OS, so looking at what funky routers do is
not the answer.  Linux is a *nix look-a-like, so should follow what the
majority of other vendors do if this is not in any standard that we wish to
follow.  End of story.  I don't care if it breaks diald or ISDN cards or
whatever.  If it is diametrically opposed to the standards and/or what other
*nix vendors do, then it is wrong.
