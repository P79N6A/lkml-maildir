That's actually scsi:t-0x04 in the patch.  But it makes no real
difference and is trivial to adjust.

Yeah, as mentioned in my second comment - it's the same as 8139cp vs
8139too drivers.
But sure it's possible to change the things in the future, since it's
all internal to kernel - the only requirement is that modalias device
attribute should match module alias attributes.

Oh well.  I don't think it's worth the effort really.  Only 4 drivers so
far (sd, sr, st and osst).  The only reason to try harder is to avoid
loading of osst for non-osst tapes.  But I don't think it's a big deal
to load osst module -- it's harmless, and after all, it's always possible
to "blacklist" it on a particular machine, just like some people do with
8139cp module.

BTW, a question for osst folks (Willem Riede?) -- why osst checks for
both vendor and device strings, isn't it sufficient to just check vendor
for "OnStream" ?  Just curious maybe...

Sure thing - that's why I said it makes no difference whenever to use
hex or dec values.
