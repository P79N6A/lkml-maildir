Over the next 6-18 months, one piece at a time, it will all fall into 
place. 
Reiser4 as it is shipping today, consists of close to the minimal 
functionality necessary to replace reiser3, albeit done according to our 
plugin model, and with vastly higher performance.  The full solution is 
not yet written, wait for it.  I understand why you think deadlocks are 
everything, but avoiding them is only a small, albeit necessary, piece 
of the task.
Thanks though for pointing out issues with unlinking files that have 
been cd'd to.
