We are trying to check if 'void *' pointers in structures are used 
correctly. It's our tool for debugging.

These lines (i386 arch):
        if (hwdev == NULL || ((u32)hwdev->dma_mask != 0xffffffff))
                gfp |= GFP_DMA;
        ret = (void *)__get_free_pages(gfp, get_order(size));
Note that some of soundcards have various PCI DMA transfer limits 
(dma_mask is not set to use full 32-bits). In this case, restricting this 
hardware to allocate these buffers in first 16MB is not a very good idea.
Thus, we have own hacks to allocate memory in whole hardware area.

Debugging. We enumerate all allocations, so we can check for memory leaks.
I'm happy to say, that our code is very well debugged in this regard.
