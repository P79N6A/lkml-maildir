Yes I think it can be misunderstood, and, perhaps more importantly, still
points the user at GPLONLY when it's more likely to be a straightforward
version mismatch. Better might be:
Hint: You are trying to load a module which has unresolved symbols. These
      symbols may not be exported by this version of the kernel (perhaps
      you have a version mismatch), or they may be exported GPLONLY,
      (in which case they will not be available to your module which does
      not carry a GPL compatible license). In either case, contact
      the module supplier for assistance.
