My two cents as a non-guru: there are two different reasons for splitting 
a large BIO: 
1) some layer has hit some uncommon boundary condition, like spanning
linearly appended physical volumes in an LV or something like that
2) a fundamental 'maximum-chunkiness' allowed by some layer has been 
exceeded, like stripe size in a raid, or MAX_SECTORS in ide or something 
like that.
It would suck if the system generated large BIOS that needed to be split
for every IO operation, due to #2, but it would also suck to add overhead
to every IO operation for #1.
#1 is an exception, and I think it would be acceptible to have a splitting 
function/mempool for handling what should be a boundary condition only, 
and the concept of a call through the layers to find out #2 at open time 
would handle #2 one time per device or something like that.
