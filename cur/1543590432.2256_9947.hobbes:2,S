The obvious one would be
int gee_whiz_this_configuration_works(struct pdev *pdev) {
	return(device_is_bootable_device(pdev));
}

Which is what I said also in my last email.  I'm more than happy to write this
off as a BIOS bug, and it is highly likely that the fact that Windows doesn't
see a problem is because of the exact test I mentioned above.  The BIOS has to
setup all possible boot devices, only devices non-essential to the boot
process (sound cards, modems, crap like that) get left unconfigured.  Not
touching already configured devices would seem to be a reasonable thing to do
in my opinion.  Not that I think configuring things is wrong, but it does make
you vulnerable to BIOS table bugs like this likely exposes, where as if you
didn't touch boot devices, then buggy BIOSes wouldn't bring your kernel to a
halt as easily.
