I agree that they won't read the sources.
HOWEVER, it's also clearly unworkable to have everybody list their name,
This is what we have MAINTAINERS and CREDITS for.
Quote frankly, I doubt "managers" read the boot messages. They tend to ask
engineers who is responsible. I know I look in the MAINTAINERS file first,
then in the actual source code (some people don't want to be listed as
maintainers), and I don't think I've ever looked at a boot message on who
to worry about.
