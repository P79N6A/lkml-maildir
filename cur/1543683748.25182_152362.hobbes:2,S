Doesn't seem to do much good here. I've tried:
root=/dev/sda1
root=0801
root=801
root=2049         (0801 hex = 2049 decimal)
root=08:01
root=/dev/sda/1
but none of them gets the kernel to mount the root fs (yes, I do
have the SCSI driver and my reiserfs filesystem compiled in).
Anyone who added patches to -test2 who have a clue about what
is going on ?
