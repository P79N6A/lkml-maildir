Subject: [PATCH] vmacct3/9 mremap MAP_NORESERVE not in flags
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

There is no point in do_mremap clearing MAP_NORESERVE from its flags:
it has already validated that only the MREMAP_ flags can be set,
and it has no use for MAP_NORESERVE in the code that follows anyway.
