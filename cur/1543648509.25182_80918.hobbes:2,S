Your CPU purports to "support" HT, but It doesn't "do" HT!
Maybe somebody from Intel can explain, but I heard that they
added the HT bit before they implimented hyper-threading.
Anyways, maybe you can "turn something on" in the BIOS?
If not, it's just one of those wanabees that didn't graduate
from HT School.
