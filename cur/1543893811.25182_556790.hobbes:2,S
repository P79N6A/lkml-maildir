On disk, snapshots and subvolumes are identical...the only difference is
their starting state (sorry, it's confusing, and it doesn't help that I
interchange the terms when describing features).
Every subvolume will have a quota on the number of blocks it can
consume.  I haven't yet decided on the best way to account for blocks
that are actually shared between snapshots, but it'll be in there
somehow.  So if you wanted to make a snapshot readonly, you just set the
quota to 1 block.
But, I'm not planning on adding a way to say user X in subvolume Y has
quota Z.  I'll just be: this subvolume can't get bigger than a given
size.  (at least for version 1.0).
