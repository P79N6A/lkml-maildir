The problem is local_irq_disable() doesn't carry around a notion of
locality: It doesn't say which code and which IRQ handler is the problem.
That is each instance have to be considered :-( :-(
We could make "global", per-cpu replacement lock (would be a bit like the
BKL hack), but as soon as a RT thread hits one of those RT is totally
gone. Each IRQ-handler needs to be reviewed wether or not they must be
executed under this lock or not. By instead doing the hard work of 
breaking it into smaller locks (with PI) or veryfying that the regions are
so small that disabling preemption is acceptable, the RT property can be
preserved.
I'll try to make an option in the config: "Disallow
local_irq_disable()/preempt_disable()". Then one can switch this on to
prevent local_irq_disable() not reviewed for PREEMPT_RT to sneak in from
!PREEMPT_RT. 
I will also try to make a lock which introduces the "notion
of locallity" (i.e. have the same semantics as a normal
spin_lock/mutex) into the code, but in !PREEMPT_RT will turn out to be
just local_irq_disable() or preempt_disable(). A lot of the
local_irq_disable() should be replaced with that.
