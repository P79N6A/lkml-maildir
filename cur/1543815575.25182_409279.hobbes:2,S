Yes, exactly. But the point is, that if anybody does something like that, 
they should be
 (a) shot
 (b) told that they should never ever do that again
(Not necessarily in that order).
The thing is, the above workflow generates a _buggy_ repository. It will 
be entirely "correct" in the sense that it passes all git self-consistency 
checks, but it's not really any different from doing
	dd if=/dev/urandom of=Makefile count=2
	git commit Makefile
and then asking me to pull from the result.

Something like "git reset HEAD" + "git commit" might do it.
