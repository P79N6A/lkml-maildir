Hi, Daniel.  If you remember, a few users of the preemption patch
reported instability and/or syslog messages such as:
Sep  9 23:08:02 sjoerd kernel: __alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed (gfp=0x70/1).
Sep  9 23:08:02 sjoerd last message repeated 93 times
Sep  9 23:08:02 sjoerd kernel: cation failed (gfp=0x70/1).
Sep  9 23:08:02 sjoerd kernel: __alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed (gfp=0x70/1).
Sep  9 23:08:02 sjoerd last message repeated 281 times
It now seems that all of them are indeed using ReiserFS.  There are no
other reported problems with the preemption patch, except from those
users...
I am beginning to muse over the source, looking at when kmalloc is
called with GFP_NOFS in ReiserFS, and then the path that code takes in
the VM source.
I assume the kernel VM code has a hole somewhere, and the request is
falling through?  It should wait, even if no pages were free so, right? 
Where should I begin looking?  How does it relate to ReiserFS?  How is
preemption related?
Thank you very much,
