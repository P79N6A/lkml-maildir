Yes, and I have it running on my workstation, too.  But it's the masq
box giving me problems.

Well, I did in the original message, but here goes:
It's an AMD 486/120 on a 80486 Deep Green mainboard.  Not sure who the
mfr  is.  32M of RAM.  Currently, it has an SIIG Fast EIDE Controller on
VLB, although I get the same results using an older generic ISA I/O
card, as well.  The hard drive is a WD 1.23G, and there is a 3.5" floppy
drive.  That's all the storage on the machine.  Video is an Orchid
Fahrenheit
I attached my .config to this message, for what it's worth.
The problem: 2.2.x series kernels refuse to boot on the above machine. 
They reach the "Freeing unused kernel memory" message and freeze.
Now, I did a little exploration and found where this message was
generated from.  So I put in a couple of "printk"s around that area.  It
seems like the errant line is the open of /dev/console:
        free_initmem();
        printk("Finished free_initmem()\n");
        unlock_kernel();
        printk("Unlocked kernel\n");
        if (open("/dev/console", O_RDWR, 0) < 0)
                printk("Warning: unable to open an initial console.\n");
        printk("Opened console\n");
Now, after the "Freeing unused kernel memory: 32k" (which is generated
in free_initmem()), I get two of my debugs printed out:
Finished free_initmem()
Unlocked kernel
It never does anything with the /dev/console stuff.  It's like the open
not only fails, but also fails to return.  Now, I'm not sure what could
cause that to happen.  /dev/console (now) has complete rw permissions. 
Also, I made a little program which opens and closes /dev/console, and
it works fine:
###########################################################################
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
        int x = 0;
        x = open("/dev/console", O_RDWR, 0);
        close(x);
        fprintf(stderr,"open returned : %d\n", x);
        if (open("/dev/console", O_RDWR, 0) < 0)
                printf("Warning: unable to open an initial console.\n");
        else
                printf("Console opened fine\n");
        return 0;
}
###########################################################################
[me2v@ds9 me2v]$ /tmp/otest 
open returned : 3
Console opened fine
As you can see, the second open was taken from the kernel code, with the
printk changed to a printf
For what it's worth, the attached .config is only one in a string or
.configs.  I've tried it with and without vga mode selection, various
options on the IDE (although that now seems to be a non-issue).  I've
been through many reboots trying to track this down, without any luck. 
Hopefully, somebody else can shed some light on the problem...
