Okay great, thanks, everything fine then.

Yep, the driver is setting BLK_BOUNCE_ANY.

Okay, I agree highmem doesn't make any practical sense for this driver but 
I'm not really sure what it would gain. if !CONFIG_HIGHMEM the bvec_kmap_irq 
turns info "(page_address((bvec)->bv_page) + (bvec)->bv_offset)" directly 
anyway. I am a bit unsure about it all but it's not the case that we can 
then leave out the entire bio_for_each_segnment() loop is it?
(generic kernels with HIGHMEM enabled are I guess an argument...)

I noticed by the way there was a bit too much emphasis on the "I" in this 
message; it's in fact Pekka Enberg who  started this and did the core stuff!
Yes ,the current legacy CD-ROM drivers really are complete crap by now. Once 
this mitsumi driver is in final shape it should serve as a nice template for 
the few other types that I'd like to keep supported and the rest can just go.
Thanks again for the prompt comments.
Rene.
