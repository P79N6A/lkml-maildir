Note that these pages should be *really* rare. Definitely even for normal
filesystems I think RMW would use too much bandwidth if it were required
for any significant number of writes.
I don't want to mandate anything just yet, so I'm just going through our
options. The first two options (remove, and RMW) are probably trickier
than they need to be, given the 3rd option available (temp buffer). Given
your input, I'm increasingly thinking that the best course of action would
be to fix this with the temp buffer and look at improving that later if it
causes a noticable slowdown.
Thanks,
Nick
