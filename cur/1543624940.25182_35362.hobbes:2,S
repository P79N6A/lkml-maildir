Contiguous virtual pages, but discontiguous physical pages.
The advantage being that you only need one set of virtual tags per "wide" 
entry, and you just fill the whole wide entry directly from the cacheline 
(ie the TLB entry is not really 32 bits any more, it's a full cacheline).
The _real_ advantage being that it should be totally invisible to 
software. I think Intel does something like this, but the point is, I 
don't even have to know, and it still works.
