Excellent!  I've always wanted to find time to make the code generic
and add MSI support for some new platform like PPC 440SPe, but it's
never made it very far up my list.

It seems OK to me to say that a driver's probe routine could be called
with MSI enabled.  A naive driver would just use the irq number from
the PCI device struct and never care whether interrupts were INTx or
MSI.  This does fall down for hardware like tg3, where something
beyond the simple PCI header manipulation is required to turn on MSI use.
Full MSI-X would be much harder to handle transparently, since
handling multiple different interrupts typically requires a lot more
logic in the driver.
