Just an idea: And what about creating a new tree (like -r4),
maintained by namesys people, tested by several people, with dedicated
mailing list, etc.?
That way, the code could be patched, updated and cleaned over the time
(without firing up people), it could be tested without pain, people
would send more bug reports and every work would be centralized.
Reiser4 would get much more attention.
