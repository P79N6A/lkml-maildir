I've been thinking about something like:
struct page *dma_map_to_page(struct device *dev, void *cpu_addr,
			     dma_addr_t dma_addr, int page_offset);
Where:
- dev is the struct device which was passed to dma_alloc_coherent()
- cpu_addr is the address returned from dma_alloc_coherent()
- dma_addr is the DMA address returned from dma_alloc_coherent()
- page_offset is the offset into the mapping.
This allows an architecture to define the above as a macro.  If the
architecture is coherent (ie, as x86 is), then they only need to do
this in their asm/dma-mapping.h header:
#define dma_map_to_page(dev,cpu,dma,off) virt_to_page((cpu) + (off) << PAGE_SHIFT)
This reflects essentially what we have today in snd_pcm_mmap_data_nopage().
However, in the non-coherent case, this becomes very much architecture
dependent, and an architecture probably wants to translate either the
DMA address or CPU address to a struct page by some method.

I think we just need to make sure that architectures define
pgprot_writecombine() and pgprot_uncached(), like ARM and ia64 both
do.

I think for the moment we'll leave this issue alone for now (and I'll
put up with the hacks.)  Once we've sorted (1) out, we should have a
better idea how to sort (2).
