Editing the init scripts can get rid of a lot of the messages.
Not sure about the ones from the kernel though,
Like mem/cpu info, disk info, and serial info.
I guess you could change the kernel, and modify the printk
messages so the ones you always see but don't want are not
done, presumably selected with #ifdef, #else, #endif
sets, so you can enable them easily if needed.
Or add a kernel paramete to enable/disable those messages.
Then you could turn them on/off without recompiling.
Not for the faint of heart though....
