Was it a known problem for some time?
I haven't been testing 2.5.x series for some time, and also haven't
read linux-kernel list last few months, so I don't know exact history
of the bug. If you can enlighten me, I'm just curious... :)
I rememeber other more complicated bugs from the older 2.5.x kernels,
and now I'll test if they're solved in newer ones. I might need some
help if they still exist (could you lend me a hand if that's the
case?) as I was getting Oracle internal error - coredump - with only
one meaningful sentence (at least to me :)). Google was silent on the
case. :(
