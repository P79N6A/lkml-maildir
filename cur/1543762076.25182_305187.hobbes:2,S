Then I don't see how we decide when to clear a pointer at each
level.  Are there counters of how many entries are active in each
table at all levels (pgd/pud/pmd/pte)?
Consider the case where two or more vmas are mapped at addresses that
share a pgd entry, but are far enough apart that you don't want
to coalesce them.  First call down through that pgd entry must
leave the pointer to the pud (or pmd/pte for systems with less
levels) so that the next call can still get to the pud/pmd/pte
to clear out entries for the other vma.  But without counters
(at all levels) you don't know when you are all done with a table,
or whether you need to leave it for the next call.
If you want to pursue this, then there are probably some fields
in the page_t for the page that is being used as a pgd/pud/pmd/pte
that are available (do all architectures allocate whole pages for
all levels of the page tree?)
Alternatively you could modify the use of floor/ceiling as they
are passed down from the top level to indicate the progressively
greater address ranges that have been dealt with ... but I'm not
completely convinced that gives you enough information.  You would
need to do careful extension of the ceiling at each level to make
sure that you reach out to the end of of each table at each level
to account for gaps between vmas (which would result in no future
calldown hitting this part of the table).
