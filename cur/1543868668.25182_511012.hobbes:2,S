aio-stress command lines used for test
1) mem=1G in kernel boot param if you have more
2) mk2fs for test_file
3) dd if=/dev/zero of=<test_file> bs=1M count=1200
4) aiostress -s 1200m -o 2 -i 1 -r 16k <test_file>

I looked through the thread and couldn't find the aio-stress command
line used for the whole test.  Could you please post it here?
