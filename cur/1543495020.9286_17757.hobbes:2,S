Infact reschedule_idle() should take care (currently in 2.2.8-pre2 has
some relevant problem according to me) also to reschedule a running task
in function of the avg_slice, the priority of the task and if it's
timeslice is going to expire.

I am not sure if we need an higher HZ rate, but before increasing the HZ
rate is better to get reschedule_idle() working as best. Far better to
spend more time in the wakeup path then having a fixed cost all the time
(that will invalidate L1 cache).
