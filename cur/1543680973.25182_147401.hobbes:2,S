Ok, I am using an nVideo nForce2 based mother board (Asus A7N8X Delux). 
Linus wanted people to try out the 2.5 stuff.  I installed
kernel-2.5.75-1.21.athlon.rpm provided by the person at RedHat that
mentioned it yesterday.
It brings up my ethernet, and I get a message saying it is a 3Com 3c920
based card.  I then get "divert: allocating divert_blok for eth0" and
the system hangs.
I was unable to get sak to show anything.  I will keep trying.
