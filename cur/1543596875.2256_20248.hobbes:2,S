afair, the mobile Durons are not based upon the Athlon 4 core, and
hence won't have the features you mention. You can verify this with
my x86info tool which you can get from
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/davej/x86info/x86info-1.3.tgz
This will decode the PowerNOW capabilities register (if it exists)
and tell you if its capable of Bus speed division/Voltage ID control.
I'd be interested in getting the output of x86info -a on this
send to me by private mail btw.
Oh, and you'll need a kernel with the MSR/CPUID drivers loaded.

The kernel side implementation of this lives in Russell King's CVS.
Grab it using..
cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pubcvs.arm.linux.org.uk:/mnt/src/cvsroot login
cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pubcvs.arm.linux.org.uk:/mnt/src/cvsroot checkout cpufreq
cvs commit list: 
http://www.linux.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/cpufreq-commit
Note, the Athlon 4 implementation of PowerNOW is currently unsupported,
I'm looking into this right now, after having a chance to talk with
some of the AMD guys at the UKUUG developers conference last week.
The PowerNOW implementation in the CVS tree is equivalent to that
available in my Powertweak program (
http://www.powertweak.org
) and
its derivative 'k6mult'.
As this implementation was largely reverse engineered, its incomplete
and only supports bus scaling, not voltage scaling. This is something
else we hope to get supported sometime.
The userspace support for this is about to commence, in both a standalone
utility, and a Powertweak plugin.
regards,
Dave.
