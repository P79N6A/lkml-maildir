Yes, a process doesn't have a valid pid number in a descendant pid
namespace. So a process receiving a signal from an upper level PID
namespace will see the signal originator as "not meaningful".

This is because the semantics are still under discussion (see thread
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/25/458
).
There are also places that are not addressed by this patchset, but where
the signal originator pid might have to be cleared, like the following:
1. POSIX message queues: if the process that registers for notification
through mq_notify() is in a descendant namespace of the one that sends a
message to the mqueue.
2. a process is set as the SIGIO receiver through fcntl(F_SETOWN) and
the write() to the file is done by a process that belongs to an ancestor
namespace.
Also, if the implementation proposed by this patchset is adopted, we
should add a note on what could appear as a change in the ABI for the
rt_sigqueueinfo() call: this call explicitely sends a siginfo_t
structure. So the si_pid might have been filled by the caller. But if
the signal receiver of this rt_sigqueueinfo() is in a descendant
namespace, the si_pid field will be cleared by the kernel.
