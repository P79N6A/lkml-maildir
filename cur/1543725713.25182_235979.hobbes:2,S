Predicting the future is hard, but I suspect this number to be small.
Let's say 10 in core kernel code?
If this takes off as a solution for error reporting, that number will be
much larger in drivers.

The race is definitely not worth fixing.  If it bothers you, then
removing kmessage_exit() makes sense.  I will do that.

Can be removed.

I am a fanatic about freedom?  Seriously, I will talk to Arjan about
changing it.  I do not care either way.
Updated patch forthcoming.
