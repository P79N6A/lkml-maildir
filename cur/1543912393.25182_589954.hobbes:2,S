Hi all,
I have a question regarding the average number of assembly
instructions per line of kernel code. I know that this is a difficult
question since it depends on many factors such as the instruction set
architecture, compiler used, optimizations used, type of code, coding
style, etc...
I would like to know a rough estimate for such a quantity for the
kernel 2.4/2.6 code running on MIPS32 architecture.
My estimate is between 5-10 instructions. I googled for such a thing
but couldn't find any useful papers/resources.
Many thanks in advance.
Best regards
