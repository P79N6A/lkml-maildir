You keep ignoring the fact that, as Herbert and I discussed, not
blocking for IPSEC resolution will make some connect() cases fail that
would otherwise not fail.
There are two sides to this issue, and we need to consider them
both.
Long term a resolution-packet-queue provides a solution that handles
both angles correctly, but we don't have that code yet.
