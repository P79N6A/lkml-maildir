Sorry, you're right. I had misread the original post - the ttypX group has
nothing to do with the Unix98 ptys. It's plain old pseudo-terminals.

Did you try erasing your wtmp/utmp files? There's an issue on
incompatibility (there's even a daemon included with glibc - utmpd IIRC)
in which libc5 applications will break if the utmp is libc6, and
vice-versa. I think I can remember the _same_ problem as you had, that
went away when I killed some files in /var/log

Is w libc5 or libc6? What about who?

stracing xterm might give your a hand

You shouldn't need to recompile glibc2 - I don't think your problem lies
there. It's always nice to install a new glibc, however, specially when
you switch binutils versions.. I had a major crash doing it a while back.
