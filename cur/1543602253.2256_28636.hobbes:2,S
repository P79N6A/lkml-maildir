I've got a Dell Inspiron 8000 laptop, I had problems with 2.4.9 and .8 with 
AC patches where my system would turn itself off at seemingly random 
intervals, and closing my display would freeze the machine. 
Well, 2.4.9 clean was fine as was 2.4.8, but now 2.4.10 is doing it again, I 
upgraded my BIOS to the newest avail just in case with no change. 2.4.10 
doesn't seem to power off, but it will freeze on display close and will power 
off if the display is left closed for a while. All power management in my 
BIOS is off as it has been forever.j
I mentioned this on the list a while back with 2.4.8-ac-something
