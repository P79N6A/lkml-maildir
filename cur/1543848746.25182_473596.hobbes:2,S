Thanks for the hint. I am still a bit puzzled why there are so many 
serial ports detected even though there is only ttya and ttyb on the 
back:
Console: switching to mono PROM 80x24
su0 at 0x000001fff13062f8 (irq = 5,7ea) is a 16550A
su1 at 0x000001fff13083f8 (irq = 9,7e9) is a 16550A
ttyS0 at MMIO 0x1fff1400000 (irq = 7901920) is a SAB82532 V3.2
Console: ttyS0 (SAB82532)
ttyS1 at MMIO 0x1fff1400040 (irq = 7901920) is a SAB82532 V3.2
ttyS2 at MMIO 0x1fff1200000 (irq = 7901664) is a SAB82532 V3.2
ttyS3 at MMIO 0x1fff1200040 (irq = 7901664) is a SAB82532 V3.2
One of them may actually be the mouse though currently no [SUN4] 
keyboard (and hence no mouse) is attached.
