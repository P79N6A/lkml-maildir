Vladimir Saveliev had the numbers ready at hand after all, and said:
The most noticeable gain is found in the folowing test (not sure that it 
can be considered as effective readahead though): ls -l over directory 
containing 30000 files (named numerically) created in random order :
4.87 with no readahead
2.99 with readahead (which is limited by 25% of ram or by directory and 
all its stat data)
