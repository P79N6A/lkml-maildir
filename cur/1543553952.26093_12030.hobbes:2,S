No, that's the reason this is a quirk.  The hardware is already
only responding to one and only one address.  The old code did
exactly the same thing, only not inside the quirk framework,
which made it kinda harder to figure out what was going on.

Got a better suggestion?  It does seem completely reasonable to
reserve some address space for a CardBus bridge if we find one.
