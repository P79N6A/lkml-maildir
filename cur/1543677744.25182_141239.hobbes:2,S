Maybe he just enabled vga16 + XXXfb. First vga16 comes up, and start
painting characters. Few microseconds after that XXXfb (for example
matroxfb) comes up, registers itself as /dev/fb1 and reprograms hardware
to non-VGA mode. 
From that point on vga16fb paints characters to unmapped memory, and
there is only black on screen.
