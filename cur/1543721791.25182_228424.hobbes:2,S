That's why responsible vendors develop their feature in
the upstream kernel before they merge it into their own
product.
That way they know in advance they'll won't need to maintain
the feature as a separate patch for more than one product ;)

Ideally the vendor would come up with an acceptable form in
the first place.  Not out of a moral obligation to the Linux
community, but because doing that means free QA and better
quality source code that's easier to support...
Sure, it is some short term work for the vendor, but it'll
save work in the long run.
