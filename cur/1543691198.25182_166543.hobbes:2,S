I'm suggesting the prefetch workaround be on by default, and also the
option would only by visible if someone selects the new "compile only
for cpu XXX" feature.
There's no danger in turning the option off, as long as the init code
always detects AMD prefetch, and turns off in-kernel prefetching if
the workaround isn't configured in.  That's just a performance hit.
We already have a mechanism for removing prefetch instructions when
SSE isn't present, and should be used to handle this too.
