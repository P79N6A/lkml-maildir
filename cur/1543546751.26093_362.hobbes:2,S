Tough. It's still because YOUR program is buggy. You closed a file
descriptor that was in use.

No. SuS agrees with me 100%.
The above is exactly what Linux does. The file descriptor is the _integer
number_allocated_to_that_process_ to describe the file. It has got NOTHING
to do with the file itself - think about dup() etc. 
The _file_ is kept open by the poll(). The file descriptor is closed.
Think about mmap(): you can do
	mmap(fd)
	close(fd);
	... the _file_ is still active through the mapping ...
and the mmap doesn't go away. Nobody expects the mmap() to go away just
because you closed the fd. It's still there - and in fact SuS _requires_
that it is still there.
The poll case is 100% the same.
As is, btw, read() and write() and just about everything else. Try it. Do
	thread 0
	read(fd, xxxxx) /* blocks */
					close(fd);
	... read continues to work ...
and the above is obviously the only "sane" semantics. 
"fd" is just a handle. Once you've looked it up, it's not used any more.
Closing it after the fact is a non-issue - you just got rid of the handle
that we've already used.

Nope.
Should close() wait until all memory mappings are gone too? Obviously not.
