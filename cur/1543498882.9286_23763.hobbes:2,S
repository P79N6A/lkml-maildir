Wouldn't it be better to share the real-mode switching code with the reboot
code in machine_restart ? Perhaps by merging both into a generic 
"void execute_in_realmode(void (*)(void *))" function. Having such stub code
twice is redundant and wastes precious kernel memory. Also it is harder
to maintain, because bug fixes have to be duplicated then.
