I booted into 2.4.17-rc2aa1(compiled w/ gcc-3.0.3), and after an hour of 
uptime or so, was unable to read anything in /proc (top locked, procinfo, and 
I couldn't kill them b/c killall and pidof would lock as well)
I made only one mod. I changed HZ to 1024, but I don't think that should have 
done it.
I figure either a problem in gcc 3.0.3, or a kernel bug.
Ideas?
