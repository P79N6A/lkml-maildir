It's only that good because gcc handles it transparently.

That is what is currently done on x86-64 in the major distributions
(SUSE,RedHat) at least.
Anything compiled with the new gcc is marked NX on unless
it has a trampoline. Old executables are run with NX off.
I would keep the default for old executables off, because
the applications which need the gcc trampolines are more
widely spread that one first things (e.g. most Ada programs
compiled by GNAT and GNAT itself require this and we 
got a few other reports of third party programs breaking)
But that's handled by the policy of only doing it for programs
compiled by the new gcc.
Of course that is only for the stack. Making the heap non executable
is another can of worms. I don't know if Fedora does that
too, SUSE and mainline x86-64 doesn't.

That exists too on x86-64:
/* noexec32=opt{,opt} 
Control the no exec default for 32bit processes. Can be also overwritten
per executable using ELF header flags (e.g. needed for the X server)
Requires noexec=on or noexec=noforce to be effective.
Valid options: 
   all,on    Heap,stack,data is non executable.         
   off       (default) Heap,stack,data is executable
   stack     Stack is non executable, heap/data is.
   force     Don't imply PROT_EXEC for PROT_READ 
   compat    (default) Imply PROT_EXEC for PROT_READ
*/
and the same for 64bit processes:
/* noexec=on|off
Control non executable mappings for 64bit processes.
on      Enable
off     Disable
noforce (default) Don't enable by default for heap/stack/data, 
        but allow PROT_EXEC to be effective
*/ 
BTW 64bit processes mostly have the same problem - there are some
that break since the first x86-64 distributions didn't use NX.
