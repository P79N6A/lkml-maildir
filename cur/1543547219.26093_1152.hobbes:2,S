Ahh, that there is the problem.  To explain I'd better start with
basically what the device is:
  The device is a 168 pin SDRAM card which has a bunch of RAM on it
and also has a fat FPGA in the middle.  The FPGA can be programmed
to do various interesting things like the mod exponentiation for
SSL, image processing (think photoshop plugins), etc.  You can have
multiple firmware cores on the card(s) that are context shifted
among at runtime by the driver etc etc.  API semantics for the
driver are the predictable open, read, write, close, trigger (tell
card to start processing written data), and wait (wait for driver to
tell its done).
  Now the device behaves just like memory to the BIOS during POST
etc, and is in fact, exactly memory if no device drivers are loaded.
If a device driver is loaded and it detects one or more of these
devices then they and their memory ranges become obviously special.
Now, we can detect the devices and where their address ranges are
via the SMBUS and some careful probing so we know what we are trying
to grab.  The problem is just telling the rest of the kernel that in
a clean VM&heap-happy manner.
