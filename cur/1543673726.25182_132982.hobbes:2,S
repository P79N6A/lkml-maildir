   this patch adds a reference count to atm_dev, and a lock to
   protect the members of struct atm_dev.  atm_dev_lock is now
   used to protect the atm_dev linked list.
Nice.  You may wish to try and make it so that atm_dev_lock
can be privatized to one file, using callbacks or something
similar, so that the device list implementation isn't exported
all over the place.
   -	fops_get (dev->ops);
   +	try_module_get(dev->ops->owner);
Use __module_get() in this kind of situation.
Fix this up and resend, thanks.
