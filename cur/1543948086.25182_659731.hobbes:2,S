Why the double-negative?  As best as I can tell, the return value of
mpol_store_user_nodemask() is only used in conditional contexts:
    $ grep mpol_store_user_nodemask mm/mempolicy.c
    static inline int mpol_store_user_nodemask(const struct mempolicy *pol)
        if (mpol_store_user_nodemask(policy))
        if (!mpol_store_user_nodemask(a))
        if (!mpol_store_user_nodemask(pol) &&
So I see no need to waste the instructions needed (in the three copies
of this code, since it's static inline) to convert a non-zero value to
exactly the value 1.
Hmmm ... speaking of static inline ... I can knock 600 bytes (that's
IA64 bytes, so equivalent to about 300 x86 bytes) off the kernel text
size by not inlining the mm/mempolicy.c routines check_pgd_range() and
interleave_nid().  I wonder if that would be worth doing.  Perhaps
those two routines are in sufficiently tight corners that the duplicate
copies of them is needed.
