Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Adaptive Domain Environment for Operating Systems

I've put up the following (white) papers out for general discussion:
-Adaptive Domain Environment for Operating Systems (Adeos)
-Building a Real-Time Operating System on top of the Adeos
The first paper discusses the design and implementation of a nano-kernel-
like facility that may be used to take control away from an unmodified
running linux on ix86 for further uses including (but not limited to):
-patch-less kernel debuggers/probers
-running multiple general purpose OSes on the same hardware,
-OS development
-etc.
As the first item suggests, this may be of interest to some on
this list as kernel debuggers have been a rather pointy subject...
The second document discusses a special case usage of Adeos that
enables a real-time-bound kernel to co-exist with Linux on top of
Adeos.
The documents can be found here:
http://www.opersys.com/adeos/index.html
I've requested a project entry for Adeos on sourceforge and will
update the project's home page as soon as everything is set up.
In the mean time, anyone interested to participate in the project
or that has pertinent information regarding the implementation, or
its feasibility or lack of, as described in the Adeos document is
welcomed to contact me.
KEEP IN MIND that the documents are only a suggested method of
doing things designed to stimulate discussion. There isn't one
line of functionnal code out there (yet).
Best regards,
Karim
