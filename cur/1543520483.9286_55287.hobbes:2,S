Yesterday I tracked a bug in the SCSI layer: oops, the current CPU owned the
io_request_lock:
* oops.
* a few seconds later: lock-up on the io_request_lock.
* NMI oops detection: several additional oops'es, the screen scrolls down,
ie you cannot copy it with paper&pencil.
* was not logged to the disk because the io_request_lock was missing.
* no serial console, no line printer was available.
I asked Sergey to restart with UP, and I immediately got a usefull oops
report.
IMHO it's a good advice.
