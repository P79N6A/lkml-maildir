Adding another secret doesn't improve security in that case. 
Of course the first block is vulnerable to known plaintext attacks, but you
can only prevent those if you make the IV dependend on another secret.. the
key for example. But then you could have also just increased the key size,
which somehow automatically leads to the conclusion: the key is the only
secret which matters. You don't add security if you split the secret.
