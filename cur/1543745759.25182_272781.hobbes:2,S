Split != per-cpu, though it may be. Counterexamples are
as simple as atomic_inc(&mm->rss[smp_processor_id()>>RSS_IDX_SHIFT]);
Furthermore, see Robin Holt's results regarding the performance of the
atomic operations and their relation to cacheline sharing.
And frankly, the argument that the space overhead of per-cpu counters
is problematic is not compelling. Even at 1024 cpus it's smaller than
an ia64 pagetable page, of which there are numerous instances attached
to each mm.
