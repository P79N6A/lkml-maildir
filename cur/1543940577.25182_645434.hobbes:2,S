Thanks Greg.  What happened to "Can't we all try to get along"?

Maybe I'm insufficiently imaginative.  Can you come up with a plausible
way in which the two patches I posted will succumb to bugs?  After those
patches we only use mmconf if:
 1. conf1 has failed to work
OR
 2. user has compiled their own kernel without support for conf1
OR
 3. kernel probes config space 0x100 to see if it can access extended
    config space (requires the device to be PCIe or PCI-X2)
OR
 4. root attempts to lspci -xxxx or lspci -v
OR
 5. device driver tries to access extended config space
With Arjan's patch, I believe only case 3 changes.  In cases 4 and 5,
either lspci or the device driver will jump through the hoop to enable
access to extended config space.

lspci is broken.  It used to be able to access extended config space, and
now can't unless it is patched to know about the sysfs flag to enable it.
If you're determined to implement something to disable extended config
space by default, it can be done in a much better way than Arjan's patch
-- less code (both source and object).
