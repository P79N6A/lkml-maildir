Jean, do you sign off on this?  In any case I think this should
be going through your I2C patches.
I'd be a trifle uneasy just deleting this, because it's possible
there are *unknown* users ... and also because nobody's yet done
a userspace interface to the gpiolib infrastructure.  (It seems
to be the usual case of nobody wanting such a thing quite enough
to write the code.)
I'd be more comfortable marking it as obsolete and flagging it
for removal a release or two after Eric's new version merges ...
though maybe that's just paranoia.
