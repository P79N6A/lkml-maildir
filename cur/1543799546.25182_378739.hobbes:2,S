IBM x306 p4 3.0ghz UP/HT (acpi=ht) 1gb ram 
It's a 64bit pci bus, the quad card is 64 bit also.
Underlying host os is debian sarge.
I never thought to check /proc/interrupts. I get the network card back
from remote soon, I will put it in a bench system and see what happens.
What should I be looking for in /proc/interrupts?
