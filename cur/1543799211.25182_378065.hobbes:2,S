I dropped working on the replacement because I wanted to do just that. I 
sent my patch only because Matt and Steve talked about writing a 
replacement and thought they would be interested to see it.
I am all for gradual improvements but after taking a stab at it, I 
starting to think rewriting would be easier, simply because the slab 
allocator has been clean-up resistant for so long.
