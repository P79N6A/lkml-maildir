Gnutella client.  Forgot about that.  I agree, it is not reasonable to
expect low latency with this kind of network traffic happening.  I am
impressed it worked as well as it did.

Interesting.  There is an overwhelming consensus amongst Linux audio
folks that you should use reiserfs for low latency work.  Should I try
ext3?
