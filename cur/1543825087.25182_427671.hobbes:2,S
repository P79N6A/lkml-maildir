That behaviour would be fair. Let the priority govern who gets to run
first (irrespective of their cap) and then use the cap to limit their
timeslice (execution time).

But among all tasks that exceed their cap (there is no priority based
scheduling). As far as preemption is concerned, if they are moved to
the expired array, capped tasks will only run if an array switch takes
place. If it does, then they get their fare share of the cap again
until they exceed their cap.
