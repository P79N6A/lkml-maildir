it would be nicer to do the arithmetis on pos as pointers rather than unsigned
long.  Also you might want to use alloc_pages + vmap instead of vmalloc so that
you already have a page array.  Or we should provide a helper that walks over
a vmalloc'ed region and calls vmalloc_to_page + vm_insert_page.  Either way
this type of code is duplicated far too much and we'd really need some better
interface for it.
