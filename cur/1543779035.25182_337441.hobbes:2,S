This might depend on compiling with frame pointers, or not. I recall that at
one point, the kernel did a basic scan of addresses that looked like likely
candidates to have been pointers, and printed those.
Frame pointers are hailed as improving backtraces. They are in the 'kernel
hacking' section of the kernel configuration.
Sorry that I can't be more precise, but try turning on frame pointers.
Good luck!
