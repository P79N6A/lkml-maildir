Ok, I was actually really surprised that we'd ever allow a non-slab page 
to be free'd as a slab or kmalloc allocation, without screaming very 
loudly indeed. That implies a lack of some pretty fundamental sanity 
checking by default in the slab layer (I suspect slab debugging turns it 
on, but even without it, that's just nasty).
Can you see if this trivial patch at least causes a honking huge 
"kernel BUG" message to be triggered quickly?
Trond wrote an alternate patch for the actual problem which I sent 
separately, but it would probably be good to have more safety in the slab 
layer by default regardless.
