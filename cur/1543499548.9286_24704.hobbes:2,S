we will start seeing increased demand when more server products appear in
the Linux market.  but there is a mixed message, as i pointed out to Alan
-- the ac patches "aren't for production servers," but that's the only
place where production shops can find this patch.
i think it would be appropriate to maintain the fdset patch as a separate
patch for 2.2 if it won't be included in the mainstream kernel.  does
redhat include the patch in it's distributed 6.0 kernels?
