I've had a couple of reports of this problem.  The offending patch is:
http://people.sistina.com/~thornber/patches/2.5-stable/2.5.51/2.5.51-dm-1/00005.patch
back it out if necc.
All it does is:

 	return ((start < dev_size) && (len <= (dev_size - start)));
 }
ie. previously we were accidentally comparing bytes with sectors to
verify the device sizes.  So either I'm being very stupid (likely) and
the above patch is bogus, or you really don't have room for this lv.
Can you send me 3 bits of information please:
1) disk/partition sizes for your PVs
2) an LVM2 backup of the metadata (the nice readable ascii one).
3) The version of LVM that *created* the lv.
Thanks,
