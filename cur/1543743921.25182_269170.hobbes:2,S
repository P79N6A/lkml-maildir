i have released the -V0.7.19 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from the usual place:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this release includes fixes only.
Changes since -V0.7.18:
 - fixed a merge bug introduced in -V0.7.18, breaking bit-spinlocks used
   by ext3's journalling code. This could/should fix the kjournald crash
   reported by Adam Heath, Gunther Persoons and Eran Mann. Bug triggered
   on !SMP kernels only.
 - added upstream patch to fix a crash in bttv/btcx_riscmem_free(), 
   reported by Shane Shrybman.
 - made modlist_lock raw again - this could fix the /proc/acpi related
   asserts reported by Karsten Wiese.
 - fixed -RT locking bug in zap_completion_queue(), this could fix the 
   asserts reported by Shane Shrybman and others.
