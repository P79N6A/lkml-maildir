For the SH-4, and the SH-5 in SHcompact mode, the insertion of constant
pools in amongst the code is essential.  The SH-4 instruction set has
specific "load word/longword from 2N/4N bytes forward of current PC"
instructions (mov.[wl] @(disp,PC),Rm)  for this.  It seems a reasonable
enough way of handling large immediates in a 16-bit encoding.
For SH-5 in SHmedia mode, it probably isn't really necessary to put
switch tables inside the .text section, but it's what the current
toolchains do.

As it turns out, it looks like the SH-5 toolchains already do that.  The
kernel was forcing readability onto mappings unnecessarily.  I've done
some local fixes to sh64/2.6 today, and the results of the program are
now coming out:
Requested PROT | ---    R--    -W-    RW-    --X    R-X    -WX    RWX
