And this fixed ntpd (in mode 4) right up.  But now Im seeing some 
fussing from Xprint when its started, from my logs:
Jul 19 10:59:58 coyote rc: Starting xprint:  succeeded
Jul 19 10:59:58 coyote kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 7 to 59
Jul 19 10:59:58 coyote kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 7 to 59
Jul 19 10:59:59 coyote Xprt_33: lpstat: Unable to connect to server: Connection refused
Jul 19 10:59:59 coyote Xprt_33: No matching visual for __GLcontextMode with visual class = 0 (32775), nplanes =
8
Jul 19 11:00:00 coyote kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 7 to 59
The font path stuff I snipped has been there since forever.
And, I didn't get the set_rtc_mmss messages when I did a service xprint restart.
Is this even connected to Xprint, that looks like something from maybe ntp?
And of course in mode 4, tvtime has a blue screen.  But you knew that. :)
