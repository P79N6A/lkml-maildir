Hi there,
Could someone explain what kupdate and kflushd do? I have a strange problem,
when i ftp to my server, i get like 6500Kb/s for the first then seconds.
That's
the same speed i get to another server on the same subnet.
But within a few seconds the CPS suddenly drops to 2500kb/s and when i look
at the server i see that kupdate takes 80% of the cpu usage. I tried to
disable kupdate ( i searched the mailinglist on how to do that ) kflushd
had the same behaviour.
Coould some explain what could be causing the trouble? I'm using the 2.2.16
kernel.
Thanks,
Jeroen Geusebroek
P.s. please reply to me directly or CC me, because i'm not on the list.
