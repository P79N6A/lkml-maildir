Hi Alan,
	first of all, thanks for you -acX, it solved several issues in my Dell 
X200, the inclusion of XFS is great, and dri/drm with xfree 4.3 works  
perfectly with the i830M (thanks).
But there still several problems (with APM enabled, no framebuffer):
- With cpufreq enabled, the kernel hangs if you change the CPU speed 
_after_ a suspend/resume via the old interface (/proc/sys/cpu/0/speed, 
(also repeatable in a vanilla or -rc1 kernel)). It doesn't happen if my 
governor program uses /proc/cpufreq instead. I saw this bug also with the 
original cpufreq patch and also with 2.5.68.
- cat /proc/i8k produces a long kernel lock, everything gets locked for a 
few seconds. If you are playing a music, you must restart the program in 
order the get alsa sync'd again.
- After suspend/resume, the kernel hangs during a shutdown (just like the 
infamous w98se shutdown bug :-), it happens after all processes have been 
TERMed. Sometimes the screen goes white (it happens also with Marcelo 
tree). I tried this with almost every different version and bios 
workaround in APM kernel options. I also happens with 2.5.68.
- The kernel hangs/lock hard if IO-APIC is enabled and you try to change 
the screen brightness (<Fn><[UP][DOWN]-Arrow>). It also happens with 
2.5.68.
- ACPI doesn't see the battery, the shutdown buttons just turn down with 
notifying the kernel, suspend doesn't work. Also seen with ACPI original 
patches and 2.5.68.
- Only happens with -ac3 version: the poweroff button turns the machine 
off inmediately, it doesn't wait for a few seconds, as previous versions.
