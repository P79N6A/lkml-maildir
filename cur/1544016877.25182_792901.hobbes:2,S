The costs are less since there is no need to have metadata for each of
the 4k sized pages. Instead there is one contiguous chunk that can be
tracked as a whole.

The benefit of going from 4k to 32k is that 8 times as many objects may be
handled by the same 2M TLB covering a 32k page. If the 4k pages are
dispersed then you may need 8 2M tlbs (which covers already a quarter of
the available 2M TLBs on nehalem f.e.) for which the larger alloc just
needs a single one.

Queue trimming can be configured in the same way in SLAB. But this means
that you are forever tuning these things as loads vary. Thats one of the
frustrations that led to the SLUB design. Also if the objects in queues
are not bound to particular page (as in slub) then traversal of the queues
can be very TLB fault intensive.

It has lists of free objects that are bound to a particular page. That
simplifies numa handling since all the objects in a "queue" (or page) have
the same NUMA characteristics. There is no moving between queues
(there is one exception but in general that is true) because the page list can
become the percpu list by just using the pointer to the head object.
Slab internal fragmentation is already a problem in SLAB. The solution
would be a targeted reclaim mechanism. Something like what I proposed in
with the slab defrag patches.
There is no need for trimming since there is no queue in the SLAB sense. A
page is assigned to a processor and then that processor takes objects off
the freelist and may free objects back to the freelist of that page that
was assigned to a processor. Memory wastage may only occur because
each processor needs to have a separate page from which to allocate. SLAB
like designs needs to put a large number of objects in queues which may
keep a number of pages in the allocated pages pool although all objects
are unused. That does not occur with slub.
