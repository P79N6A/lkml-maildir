The reason for this is that several processes can get into the
scsi_tape_open function in the driver simultaneously and this is not
allowed. There is an in_use flag which is set before the function
returns. However, the process may sleep before that when executing SCSI
commands ... Setting the flag must be moved earlier.
I will do patches for 2.2 and 2.3 tomorrow (the bug is also in the earlier
kernels). Before that I will try to find a brow paper bag ;-(
