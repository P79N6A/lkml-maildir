* Read files/sockets: you need a process context.  That means if you
  are running in an interrupt you are SOL and if you are in an existing
  process context, the context owner might get upset with you for
  playing with its fd table without its knowledge.  So the only safe
  way is to spawn a kernel thread; see below.
* libc: absolutely not.  The kernel has its own set of provided
  functions, some of which look suspiciously like libc functions, but
  your selection is very limited.  Look in your lib/ directory to see
  what is available.
* start processes: yes, if you must.  Grep for the kernel_thread()
  function.  Watch for the pitfalls (study existing usage).  If you
  want to run a userspace program, see kernel/kmod.c for an example.

(1), in general.  /proc files are a popular kludge, and /dev files with
custom ioctl() calls are almost as popular.
