Definitely agreed. I should have written this comment instead of letting you
notice this.

Yes this is the expected impact. It is OK because
1) under a same critical section of configfs_dirent_lock, depend_item()
checks that CONFIGFS_USET_DROPPING is not set and bumps s_dependent;
2) under a same critical section of configfs_dirent_lock, configfs_rmdir()
checks the s_dependent count and tries to set CONFIGFS_USET_DROPPING.

Yes, this patch may look like an improvement, independently from lockdep. I
think that locking is simpler this way, and this also removes the need for
configfs_depend_rollback(). Moreover this moves towards the management of
configfs_dirents protected by configfs_dirent_lock only. In the end, it's up to
you to judge if this is a good direction ;)
Thanks,
Louis
