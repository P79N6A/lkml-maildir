Don't know, there was never anything connected to the sata ports. It was also 
just an accident that sata was compiled statically into the kernel.
Though, with 2.6.11 we don't get the warnings:
libata version 1.10 loaded.
ata_piix version 1.03

ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xE400 ctl 0xE002 bmdma 0xDC08 irq 18

Ah, I see.
