Unfortunally i compile in all the scsi stuff and make ide-cd modular, so i
dont know what was compiled in anymore since that kernel tree is gone.  I
did however recieve a patch to test10-pre3 which seems to be working, will
test the actual record part in a bit (and this kernel i know for a fact has
scsi generic compiled in)...  thanks for the help guys
