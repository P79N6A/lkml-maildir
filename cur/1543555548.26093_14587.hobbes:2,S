Well, I tried.... but it didn't go real well.
I build a 2 drive raid5 array (the script goes on to 3,4,5,6,7 drive
arrays), ran mkfs, mounted, ran "hdparm -t" on /dev/md0, ran bonnie.
So far so good.
Then I ran "dbench 20".
This produced lots of errors.
The first few were :
(3012) unlink CLIENTS/CLIENT9/~DMTMP/ACCESS/FASTENER.LDB failed (Operation not permitted)
.(3012) unlink CLIENTS/CLIENT11/~DMTMP/ACCESS/FASTENER.LDB failed (Operation not permitted)

(11940) nb_stat: CLIENTS/CLIENT0/~DMTMP/PARADOX/__3F2C4.DB wrong size 2048 4096
So it looks pretty sick.
After a reboot I tried some simple experiments. Watch what happened.
cage # echo hello > /afile
cage # > /afile
cage # echo there > /afile
bash: /afile: Permission denied
cage # echo hello > /bfile
cage # echo there > /bfile
cage # echo all >> /bfile
bash: /bfile: Permission denied
cage # echo > /cfile
cage # echo > /cfile
cage # echo xx > /cfile
bash: /cfile: Permission denied
cage # cat /vmlinuz > /dfile
cage # cat /vmlinuz > /dfile
cage # cat /vmlinuz >> /dfile
bash: /dfile: Permission denied
cage # 
(all run as root).
It looks like extending a file is not allowed any more.
This is with 2.4.0-test11 plus assorted patches to knfsd (which should
be totally irrelevant) and raid5 (Which should not affect ext2), plus
your patch, which applied cleanly.
I'll try with a clean test11 plus your patches in the morning, but it
doesn't look good.
