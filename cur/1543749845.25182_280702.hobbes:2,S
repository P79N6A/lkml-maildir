No, clearing the altroot doesn't make it useless. If we're executing
another non-native binary, the emulator will set the altroot again. This
isn't _supposed_ to be a chroot. It's mostly to keep the dynamic linker
happy, and resetting it on exec is fine. We were doing that anyway when
it was a function of the personality, because executing new binaries
also resets the personality.
I'm using it on ppc to run i386 binaries -- it's certainly not limited
to sparc64 and ia64.

I see the point but I'm not sure I understand in detail how this can
work with namespace. It's not just /lib and /usr/lib which exist in the
altroot -- we also need certain files from /etc too, while leaving the
rest of /etc as it was. Do we have to bind-mount just those specific
files? And can we arrange for the alternate namespace to be
automatically dropped on exec() too? And can we do this without needing
the interpreter to be setuid in all cases?

Hopefully :)
