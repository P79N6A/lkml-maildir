i've released the -T3 VP patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc3-mm3-T3
Changes since -T1 (-T2 was not announced):
 - rebased to -rc3-mm3. This should fix the build problems and further 
   shrinks the -VP patch. Also, people who had USB problems please
   re-test -T3 as -mm3 is supposed to have much of those problems fixed.
   Also, the dvb-bt8xx.c build problem should be fixed in -mm3 too, plus
   a number of smp_processor_id() warnings were debugged and fixed as
   well.
 - fixed SWSUSPEND compilation. Could someone who uses swsuspend check
   whether sw-suspension works fine?
 - improved CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT - this could help debug any potentially
   remaining unbalanced preemption counts that were reported. (but
   the fixes in -mm3 could fix them as well.)
to build a -T3 tree from scratch the patching order is:
