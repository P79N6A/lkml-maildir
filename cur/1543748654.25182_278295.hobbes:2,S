Which is exactly (0xF6) what I'm getting.  Kernel version
2.6.10-rc2-mm3-V0.7.32-18
As an american, I've often wondered how to go about getting those
accented characters out of a std american keyboard.  I used to be
able to get all those accented and other stuffs out of my amiga's
keyboard, stuff like the Beta sign and so on.  No can do now, and I
miss it.
