I've just found a document on intel's site comparing 21140 and 21143.
Its reference is 27810701 and its title : "21140-AF to 21143-xD Upgrade".
Since there's nothing about the subject in this document, I assume that
they behave equally. I don't have the time right now, but probably will
during this week-end to make new tests with the doc. For those
interested, the 21143 HRM's reference is 27807401.
Regards,
Willy
