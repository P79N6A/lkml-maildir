gcc -D__KERNEL__  -DMODULE -I/usr/src/kernel-source-2.0.36/include -Wall
- -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strength-reduce -pipe -m486
- -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=586
note the -I. Change with the actual path. Best idea is try to do a make modules
and interrupt immediately and after that cut/paste the line. This debian, rhat
is same. old slack where someone have forgotten the symlinks (common in early
3.x slacks) - same, etc. It has actually been around for a while.
