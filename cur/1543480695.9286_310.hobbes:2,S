I heard that there're problems with older procps utilities.
I don't know that my problem is about this. I've never such a problem
like this with other kernels (including 2.2.0 pre1..pre7).
Problem :
after a while, top reports :
  2:20pm  up  3:38,  9 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.00
0 processes: 0 sleeping, 0 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU states:  0.0% user,  0.0% system,  0.0% nice, 100.0% idle
Mem:   63516K av,  55484K used,   8032K free,  33208K shrd,   1448K buff
Swap: 104384K av,    332K used, 104052K free                 17468K cached
 SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT  NI PRI TTY USER       PID %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND
and NO processes shown.
Can someone explain me what the problem is and what's new in 2.2.0-pre8
which produces this problem ? It looks strange for me ...
