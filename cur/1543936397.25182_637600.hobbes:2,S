Building this on my 64 bit box with ncursesw support I saw several warnings.
Adding the following to dialog.h decreased the number:
#ifdef USE_WIDE_CURSES
#define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
#endif
But it was not warning free.
In addition in your patch below you assume that
ncurses wide char support and wide char support follows each other.
This assumption makes things overly complicated.
Can we assume we have wide char support everywhere today where
we will support building Linux?
I am mostly concerned about sun, cygwin and MingW here...
If we can assume wide char support everywhere your patch will
become simplerAnd adding wide char support should be a separate step.
I tried to take a look at varous source packages and they do not
need this long list of redefinitions of the ncurses functions.
Do we do something fundamentally different than for example
dialog since this indirection is needed?
