I'm not extremely picky about naming conventions, and the abbreviation
isn't bad or anything. If there's someone else who also likes it better,
or if you yourself do, I'd change it then.

I meant it as an instance of a radix tree data structure, not to e.g.
be consolidated with the kernel's radix tree library functions (which
have the bootstrap ordering issues you describe preventing their use
for this kind of purpose). The generic software pagetables are also
radix trees, but similarly have constraints (e.g. use on machines with
hardware-interpreted pagetables) preventing consolidation with the
radix tree library code.
