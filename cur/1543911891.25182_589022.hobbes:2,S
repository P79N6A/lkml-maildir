Let's say it could possibly eliminate the xtime read seqlock on x86
(should be investigated) and can be useful to overcome the
non-synchronized TSC handling when taking TSC-based timestamps. All
these operations require locking to play with 64 bits values on 32 bits
architectures, which could be improved by cmpxchg64_local.
But again, it would require some testing to see if we can improve
performances there.
