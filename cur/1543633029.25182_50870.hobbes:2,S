We can keep the same policy as modules now - keep the usage count at 0 
when not in use. That way the module can unload at any time. module_exit() 
calls driver_unregister(), which, down the line, calls the drivers' 
remove() for each device attached to it. 
That seems a lot cleaner than anything so far; we leverage the existing
module infrastructure as much as possible. I'll see about codifying the
concept in the next day or so and sending it out..
