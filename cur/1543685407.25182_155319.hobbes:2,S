Hello Hans,
I am no native english, but 
"Comparing bitmaps.. vpf-10640: The on-disk and the correct bitmaps differs"
feels uncomfortable in my ears ;-)
I'd say "two things differ", without trailing "s". I am not even sure if
"bitmaps" shouldn't be singular "bitmap" instead.
But, as stated, I am no native, I can't be sure.
Regards,
Stephan
