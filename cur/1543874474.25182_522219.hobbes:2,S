Well, the data could also be shared outside of the container. I would see
that happening for library text sections for example.

They would only be able to impact other containers in a limited sense.
Specifically, if 5 containers have one shared area, then any process in
those 5 containers could exceed their container limits at the expense of
the shared area.

A normal read/write if it's the first reader of a file would get charged to the
container, not to the shared area. It is less likely that a file that is read()
is expected to be shared where as mapping MAP_SHARED is relatively explicit.

That is an immediate problem. There needs to be a way of mapping an arbitrary
page to a software zone. page_zone() as it is could only resolve the "main"
zone. If additional bits were used in page->flags, there would be very hard
limits on the number of containers that can exist.
If zones were physically contiguous to MAX_ORDER, pageblock flags from the
anti-fragmentation could be used to record that a block of pages was in a
container and what the ID is.  If non-contiguous software zones were required,
page->zone could be reintroduced for software zones to be used when a page
belongs to a container. It's not ideal the proper way of mapping pages to
software zones might be more obvious then when we'd see where page->zone
was used.
With either approach, the important thing that occured to me is be to be
sure that pages only came from the same hardware zone. For example, do
not mix HIGHMEM pages with DMA pages because it'll fail miserably. For RSS
accounting, this is not much of a restriction but it does have an impact on
keeping kernel allocations within a container on systems with HighMemory.

In practice, overlapping zones never happen today so a few new bugs
based on assumptions about MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES being aligned in a zone
may crop up.
