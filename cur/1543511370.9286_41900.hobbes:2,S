I'm really just guessing here, but ISO9660 was designed for CD-ROMs,
where write operations don't occur all that often (i.e. never), so it
will be missing features which would be present in most filesystems. For
example, it probably has no notion of fragmented files (you don't need
them on read-only media).
Copy your files to a regular filesystem, do whatever you're doing to
them there, then create a new image with mkisofs.
As an aside, this is probably something which needs fixing - iso9660
filesystems should always be mounted read-only, and mount's output
should reflect that.
Please correct me if I'm being clueless...
