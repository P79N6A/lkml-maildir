Ok, first thing: XFree "radeon" _is_ accelerated, though it doesn't
do 3D on recent cards
Then, the problem you are having is well known and I don't have a
simple workaround at hand other than re-initing the engine on each
console switch, which I would have very much liked to avoid... maybe
I can add an fbdev hook to the switch from KD_GRAPHICS to KD_TEXT
which is what we really want to cleanup the engine.
Can you verify that running fbset -accel 0 then back 1 cures the
problem for you ?
Ben.
