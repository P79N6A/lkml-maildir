I don't see where this rule applies here. I searched on google, but
did't find anything about rounding of color depth.

Yes, but that nothing to do with these patches.
Sorry, I don't see, where my patches for intelfb and radonfb (as said
before, I'm not sure about the imsttfb patch anyway) make the driver
less correct. Where are they wrong?
Nothing about the use of bits_per_pixel is changed.
The only change is whether 555 or 565 is default.
If those patches are wrong, than matroxfb and rivafb are buggy, too:
matrox/matroxfb_crtc2.c:
	if (var->bits_per_pixel == 16) {
		if (var->green.length == 5) {
			var->red.offset = 10;
			var->red.length = 5;
			var->green.offset = 5;
			var->green.length = 5;
			var->blue.offset = 0;
			var->blue.length = 5;
			var->transp.offset = 15;
			var->transp.length = 1;
			*mode = 15;
		} else {
			var->red.offset = 11;
			var->red.length = 5;
			var->green.offset = 5;
			var->green.length = 6;
			var->blue.offset = 0;
			var->blue.length = 5;
			var->transp.offset = 0;
			var->transp.length = 0;
		}
riva/fbdev.c
        switch (v.bits_per_pixel) {
[...]
	case 9 ... 15:
		v.green.length = 5;
		/* fall through */
	case 16:
		v.bits_per_pixel = 16;
		nom = 2;
		den = 1;
		if (v.green.length == 5) {
			/* 0rrrrrgg gggbbbbb */
			v.red.offset = 10;
			v.green.offset = 5;
			v.blue.offset = 0;
			v.red.length = 5;
			v.green.length = 5;
			v.blue.length = 5;
		} else {
			/* rrrrrggg gggbbbbb */
			v.red.offset = 11;
			v.green.offset = 5;
			v.blue.offset = 0;
			v.red.length = 5;
			v.green.length = 6;
			v.blue.length = 5;
		}
		break;
They do the same thing as intelfb and radonfb with the patches applied.
So both must be wrong or right.
