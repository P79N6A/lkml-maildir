I also heard something about this from daniel. The description I was
given implied rather different functionality, and raised rather serious
questions about the implementation he didn't have adequate answers for.
I also never saw code, despite months of occasional discussions about it.
I did get a positive reaction from you at KS, and I've also been
slaving away at keeping this thing current and improving it when I can
for a year. Would you mind telling me what the Hell is going on here?
I guess I already know I'm screwed beyond all hope of recovery, but I
might as well get official confirmation.
