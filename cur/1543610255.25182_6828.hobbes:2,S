Yes.  I based a Linux distribution on RedHat's 6.2 last year, and I am
**VERY** familiar with your anaconda installer and kernel.src.rpm build
modules.  I know the 7.X stuff got a hell of a lot better, but customers
still have to sterilize the build area are your rpm gets installed in order
to build external kernel modules.
