I would try to disable piix from old ATA tree (which was superseded by libata 
ata_piix). This is what've changed since 2.6.19 times -- you probably may turn 
the whole 'ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support' off. Another problem may lie in your 
initrd, what distro do you use/what type of initrd do you have -- it would be 
reasonable to look into it, what (which modules) does it contain and load.
