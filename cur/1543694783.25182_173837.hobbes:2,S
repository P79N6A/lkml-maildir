Okay, thanks.  I now know what the problem is.  We no longer probe OF to
get the memory size.  What I'm going to do is to take one of the patches
that has existed for a while now to put back the code needed so that we
can still talk with OF, and we'll add in a test for that as well.  I
hope to have time this week to do it.
Just curious, what bridge is in this machine (an output of lspci would
do fine, too).  Thanks.
