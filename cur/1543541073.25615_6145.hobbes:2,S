Hm...  Good question.
I probably did try "make oldconfig" when I first started using Linux,
but that was so long ago (1994) that I don't remember much.
    It's possible that I tried it and was tripped up and/or got annoyed
    because "make mrproper" automatically deletes .config.
    It's possible that I was uncomfortable with the fact that "make oldconfig"
    doesn't (I don't think) pick up default values from arch/$ARCH/defconfig.
Or maybe something else.  I honestly don't remember.
Some differences between "make oldconfig" and qconfig:
    If you diff the qconfig.out files, you find out what questions have
    disappeared, and what questions have additional options or changed
    status (e.g., no longer experimental, different text, etc.)
    You're better able to track how your setup differs from the default.
On the other hand, if I hadn't abandoned and forgotten oldconfig, I probably
wouldn't have taken the trouble to write qconfig.
Anyway, comments still welcome.
