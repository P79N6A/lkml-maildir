I feel there is a better way to fix this and the other IRDA
pnp build failure.
linux/pnp.h provides erroring inlines when PNP is disabled, but it
does not provide a full set.  In order to be fully consistent it
should provide similar stub implementations for things like
pnp_get_flags() (which is what triggers the reference to
pnp_get_resource here), for example.
Either the whole API is provided with stubs when PNP is disabled, or
none should be.  If only some interfaces get the treatment, we get
messy ifdefs such as those seen in these patches we are discussing.
