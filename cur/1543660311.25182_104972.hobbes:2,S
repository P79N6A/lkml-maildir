Hi all.
I use an Adaptec "APA-1460 SCSI Host Adapter" with kernel 2.4.20 and
wonder why the I/O causes that much CPU useage (100% sometimes). Has
PCMCIA no kind of DMA?
My laptop has this cardbus bridge:
00:03.0 CardBus bridge: O2 Micro, Inc. OZ6812 Cardbus Controller (rev 05)
I also managed to crash the driver sometimes during SANE/Avision
user-space code development. Nearly complete freeze - but Sysrq does
still work - maybe anyone is interested in an OOPS I might be able to
log via the serial line?
Any ideas?
Thanks
  - René
