Hopefully I'll have a couple of hours free to code and test the
SCHED_SOFTRR idea ;) It's hard to push for a new POSIX definition though :)
Looking at recent posts it seems that this is not the only problem though.
It seems interactivity lowered in the latest versions of the scheduler.
The good news is that Ingo is back on Earth and he'll fix it :)
