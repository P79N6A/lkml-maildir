	I've already included this on V4L tree.
	On V4L, we do provide support for older 2.6 releases (so, we have some
ifdefs to provide backport compatibility that are removed by a script
before submiting patchsets).
	If I understand well your patch, it is to be applied after 2.6.12
version. Am I right?
