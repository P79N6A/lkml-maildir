Since immediate values are by definition an optimization, I think it makes
sense to insist they be 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  A BUILD_BUG_ON() in the right
place should ensure this (probably in generic code rather than x86).

I don't think you need any modification to this file now.

This alignment is also now unnecessary.

This is now almost entirely generic code, but I suppose we can let the next

I think it would be easier to just fast-path the num_online_cpus == 1 case,
even if you want to keep this "update_early" interface.
But I like your IPI algorithm: very tight.
Thanks,
