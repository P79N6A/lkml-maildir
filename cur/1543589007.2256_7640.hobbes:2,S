Subject: [PATCH] reiserfs highmem bug on tail reads
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Ok, so all the reiserfs tail bugs weren't quite fixed yet, the last
tail fix can cause problems with highmem turned on.  Both bugs are
in fs/reiserfs/inode.c:_get_block_create_0
When reading the tail in, if the buffer was already up to date, 
we skip the disk i/o and return.  But the cleanup code assumes the 
page was kmap'd, which isn't right.
Also, there was a chance to double kmap the page if kmap scheduled a
nd the tree balanced while we slept.  This bug has been there for 
a long time.
Anyway, this was tested with Andrea's HIGHMEM_DEBUG_MERE_MORTALS 
patch to force highmem on my 128MB machine.  It works for me, but 
more testers are always good.

against 2.4.4-pre6, should work against 2.4.3 or higher.
