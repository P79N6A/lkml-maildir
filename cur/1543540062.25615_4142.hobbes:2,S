I'd prefer not to. I don't see why anybody has the right to do name
lookups before the filesystems have initialized etc.
There was a bug in the USB code that has since been fixed that could cause
it to try to execute /sbin/hotplug before user space existed, and that
could cause the oops Tigran saw. I don't know of any other such case.
