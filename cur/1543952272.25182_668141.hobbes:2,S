I see no attempt to even discuss the use of two sets
of physical storage to maintain coherent snapshots, just comments about
hostility. That's a fairly poor way to repay people who spend a lot of
time working with enterprise customers and are interested in solutions
using things like giant ramdisks and are putting in time to discuss
alternative ways of achieving the desired result.

I look forward to seeing your constructive detailed analysis of failure
modes based upon actual statistical data from real data centres. Unless
you can produce that nobody is going to take you seriously, which is bad
luck for the poor folks at violin if they are relying on you.
