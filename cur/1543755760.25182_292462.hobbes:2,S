I'll see what I can do.

I have two problems with this request:
    - The idea that the granularity in CVS is unreasonable is pure
      nonesense.  Here's the data as of this email:
		CVS		BitKeeper [*]
	Deltas	235,956		280,212
    - It is not at all an easy thing to do in CVS, we looked at it and 
      guessed it is about 3 man months of work.
So let's see what's reasonable.  In order for you to get the last 16%
of the granularity, which you need because you want to compete with us,
you'd like us to do another 3 man months of work.  What would you say if
you were me in this situation?

[*]  Commands used to generate the above data:
BK:
	bk -r prs -hnd:I: | wc -l
CVS:	
	#!/usr/bin/perl -w
	open(F, "find linux-2.5 -name '*,v' |");
	$files = $revs = 0;
	while (<F>) {
		chop;
		open(F2, $_);
		$head = <F2>;
		close(F2);
		unless ($head =~ /head\s+1\.(\d+)/) {
			warn "\n$_ is junk\n";
			next;
		}
		$files++;
		$revs += $1;
		print STDERR "files=$files revs=$revs\r";
	}
	print "\n\nfiles=$files revs=$revs\n";
