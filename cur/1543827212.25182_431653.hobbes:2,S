Subject: [RFC PATCH -rt] Priority preemption latency
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

We have run into a situation where a lower priority RT task will run after a 
higher priority RT task is awoken.  We are running the test case available 
here:
	
http://linux.dvhart.com/tests/prio-preempt/
For all required files, including librt.h, download the tarball here:

The test case returns non zero on failure, so just run it in a loop, exitting 
on failure.  The following is a patch by Mike Kravetz that seems to resolve 
the problem.
Thoughts, comments?
Thanks,

I've been looking into the priority preemption issues with [the prio-preempt 
test case]. My 'theory' is that when RT tasks are awakened they are not always
put on the 'best' runqueue.  As a result, the rt_overload functionality
has to be engaged to get the task to a CPU it can run on.  This 'delay'
in getting the task on a CPU is the 'bug' exposed by the testcase as
a lower priority task is allowed to run during this delay.
In the testcase, awakened worker tasks should all run on the same CPU
as the others are busy running other higher priority tasks.  But, from
the scheduler's point of view these other CPUs might be a better place
for the awakened task because they are 'less loaded'.
My quick and dirty patch (below) is to the try_to_wake_up path.  When
awakening an RT task don't send it to a remote CPU (determined to
be less loaded) unless it can prerempt the task running on the remote
CPU.  In such cases the task is added to the current CPU's runqueue.
I've been successfully running the C testcase for a while with this patch
applied.
I'm not sure of there is a 'complete' solution to this problem without
a redesign of 'global' RT scheduling on SMP.  The rt_overload mechanism
does not guarantee strict priority ordering (as evidenced by this bug).
Perhaps the best solution we can hope for with the current mechanism is
to make the scheduler be smarter with RT task placement on SMP.  This
would at least minimize the need for rt_overload.
