The names are rather counter-intuitive. "ll" sounds like "long long", so
why does it opearte on *unsigned* 64-bit?  Ditto for "long_log2()".
Perhaps they should be log2_u32(), log2_u64(), etc.
Even better if someone can come up with the right pre-processor magic
using sizeof/typeof so that you could just use "log2(any type)"
