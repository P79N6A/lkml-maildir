If you are serious, please consider last kernel headers vs ANSI C
discussion, then GNU extensions of the GCC C compiler and relevant "if
ICC doesn't support GCC extensions it's ICC's bug". That was about
implementation. About standards you are not serious, aren't you?
(Please don't see this as for this particular case, but as general
