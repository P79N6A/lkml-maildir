Np, the bug is somewhat annoying in that sometimes the machine has to be
running for several days. I updated that bios the same day it was
released.. (i missed the actual upload with some hours)
It only fixes what it says in the change log =P... And i had just been
in contact with them pointing them to information from Allen Martin
about the pin2 that should be pin0 bug and nothing has happened.
Now i have to find where it was that i sent that bugreport again, since
the common "international" support thingy dosn't work, and hasn't for
some time =P.
