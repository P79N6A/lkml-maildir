No warnings anymore, and it all works. I now have a full 2 yards of
wireless netowrk and dont have to run a cat5 over to muy couch :)
Apart from that, Jean Tourrilhes' site was a treasure of HOWTOs and
FAQs, so I'll spend a lot of time reading up there. Next thing up is
bluetooth, and the site seems to be the right place for that, too.

Went trough the motions of finding NetGears support on this. NetGear
now officially has landed on my list of gear not to recommend. The
while sitiation on finding firmware and tools to flash it didn't
strike me as very orderly, and I ended up using some Dlink tools I
found through Google to get my card slightly upgraded, but it seemed
to do the trick. The other Lucent/Orinoco card I had was more simple
and done in a few minutes.

I never got to try it on large files, I had a few dozen errors from a
card idling with no connectivity :)

Any benefit of using an AP over an ad-hoc network if it's only two or
three nodes in a room?
