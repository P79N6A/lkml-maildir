Two advantages to a certified logo program:
1. To ensure that the driver actually works, continues to work and  
fully supports the features of the hardware.
2. To enable PC manufactures to badge their entire systems (e.g. a  
Dell with a Linux Compatible sticker on the box).
The long term objective being to put those manufacturers who don't  
supply open source drivers at a disadvantage.
