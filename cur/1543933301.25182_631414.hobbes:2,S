"already in", I assume.
You can always tell what I have by looking at the patch:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.24-rc6/2.6.24-rc6-mm1/broken-out/git-x86.patch
It includes the head commit ID at the first line (it's in a
machine-readable form - Matthias's scripts which prepare the mm git tree
actually get the git-foo.patch info direct from the original repo rather
than by applying the diff from broken-out/)
Still.  The crash is 100% repeatable and is the same every time.  Happens
on both my i386 test boxes.

http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/config-vmm.txt
and I bisected it down to e3c1b141.
