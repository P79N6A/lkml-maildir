You have lost me here. Are there different HZes or aren't there?
The difference you make here is an artificial one. As long as you don't
change
HZ there is no other one. So once again what is the difference?
If HZ is 1000 Hz it may be wise to restrict ordinary users from using timers
at that frequency
if it has adverse effect on the system.

I don't know the times() call, and at this moment I cannot check it myself
as I do  not have access
to a Linux computer (I'm on holiday right now). Maybe you can explain to me
why times() should return
100 instead of a higher value?

Nope, but it may not be a CPU feature on other platforms as well.
The rationale is that it is a non portable clock, Linux specific. Compare
with the
counter on SGI which is called CLOCK_SGI_COUNTER. The HZ related to that
clock would then be called <XXX>_COUNTER_HZ.
I really do not think that the name is very important. So if Linus has a
preference for
one or the other that's fine with me.

I've given the matter some thought, and I have come to the conclusion that
clock ticks
would be the right unit. In user space the struct timespec is converted into
ticks/jiffies or
whatever name. The number of ticks can be expresses as a long, which is 32
bits or 64
depending on the platform. The number is always relative to the current
time.
All checks are done in user space, struct timespec is converted to ticks of
the clock itself.
Absolute time is converted to relative time in user space.
Very neat. I think I have arrived at the Right Thing. Thanks.
Expect a new patch in three weeks plus some days. (when I'm back from
holydays).
