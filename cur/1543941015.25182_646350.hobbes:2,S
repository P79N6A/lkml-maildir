This is not splitting anything. It adds PUD_PAGE_xxx and renames
LARGE_PAGE_XXX to PMD_PAGE_XXX.
Please split the patch into one, which does the rename and one which
adds the new defines.

Grep tells, that there is no remaining user of LARGE_PAGE_XXX, so this
is useless. Even if there would be users we'd better fix them right
away.
