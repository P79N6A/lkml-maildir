Not with the support I've written.  When you get the thread CPU time of any
thread but yourself, you just take ->sched_time as already stored and don't
do a sched_clock sample right then.  So you only see the amount of time
that has accrued as of that thread's last context switch or timer interrupt
(scheduler_tick), and not whatever amount is known only on the local CPU
where it is running right now.
Thanks,
Roland
