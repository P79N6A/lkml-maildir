Hi Linus,
a small update for 2.5.43. 
01: Simplify some Makefiles.
02: Add missing config.help texts, remove help text for ISA/MCA/EISA bus and
    regenerated defconfigs.
03: Bug fix for copy_to_user/copy_from_user. If the copy faults, it is
    possible that the information in the lowcore gets overwritten. The
    new code is completly independent from program check information.
04: Fixes for the 31 bit emulation of sys_recvmsg, sys_setsockopt and
    sys_futex.
05: Correct extern declaration of cpu_possible_map to get the kernel
    compiled with gcc 3.2.
06: Add module license to dasd driver, add XRC support (timestamps that
    are used for mirroring devices) and two bug fixes.
blue skies,
  Martin.
