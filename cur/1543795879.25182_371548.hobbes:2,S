Unfortunately it was a pretty ugly patch. Correctness issues with the
existing code have kept focused on my timekeeping rework, however I have
kept it in mind, and I do have a i386 vsyscall gtod patch that applies
ontop of my tod work. I've been maintaining it on the side while I focus
on the core code, but it is much cleaner now. For fun I'll try to
remember to send it out with the next release.

Yea, I didn't know enough about the VDSO/unwind bits to get it to do the
right thing w/ glibc, so that bit was pretty hackish. I'll still need
some help on this bit to make it really something that could be
included.
