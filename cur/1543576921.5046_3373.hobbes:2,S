Justin,
Although your driver has worked fine otherwise, I discovered today that it
renders my Seagate/Conner DDS-2 drive inoperative.  Any and all attempts
at accessing the device (e.g. making tar archive, 'mt -f /dev/st0 status',
etc.) result in:
st0:  Error 10000 (sugg. bt 0x0, driver bt 0x0, host bt 0x1).
The platform is a Pentium 166 with on-board aic7880 controller.
If I revert back to Doug Ledford's 5.1.31 driver, everything is fine.
Any insights or things you'd like me to try?
Steve
