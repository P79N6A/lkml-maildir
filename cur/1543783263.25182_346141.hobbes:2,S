I believe the use of the word is quite correct. Taint is synonymous to
contaminate. When you add a closed-source driver, the kernel is no
longer pure GPL, it's been contaminated by a non-GPL part. 
There may be other connotations to the word in various regions in the
english speaking world that give it much darker meanings, though, that I
don't know about.
