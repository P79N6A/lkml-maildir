I have a MOTU Fastlane and an Emu Xmidi 2x2 USB midi interfaces.  The Emu
unit works fine with current kernels.  The MOTU unit won't work with
kernels newer than 2.6.17.  I stumbled over a patch that had something to
do with a MOTU Fastlane, but I haven't been able to find it again.  Could
I get some advice on fixing MOTU Fastlane support?
