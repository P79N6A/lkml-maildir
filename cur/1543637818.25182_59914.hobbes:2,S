Then I vote for the simpler version. :)
BTW even if gcc had problems optimizing that, I'd rather make it explicit,
that the two variables contain the same information:
	activity = sem->activity = 0;
	if (!list_empty(&sem->wait_list))
		sem = __rwsem_do_wake(sem, activity);
IMO that's more readable and will still work if gcc had to flush the
cached information before using it.
bye, Roman
