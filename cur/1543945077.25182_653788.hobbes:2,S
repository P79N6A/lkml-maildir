In that spirit, there are two important aspects of a suspend/resume API that
would enable the memory manager to solve problems most effectively:
1) The device should be allowed flexibility to extend the scope of the suspend
    to what it is capable of implementing -- rather than being forced
to say that
    it does not support suspend/;resume merely because it does so at a different
    granularity.
2) It is very important that users of this API understand that it is
only the RDMA
   device handling of incoming packets and WQEs that is being suspended. The
   peers are not suspended by this API, or even told that this end is
suspending.
   Unless the suspend is kept *extremely* short there will be adverse impacts.
   And "short" here is measured in network terms, not human terms. The blink
   of any eye is *way* too long. Any external dependencies between "suspend"
   and "resume" will probably mean that things will not work, especially if the
   external entities involve a disk drive.
So suspend/resume to re-arrange pages is one thing. Suspend/resume to cover
swapping out pages so they can be reallocated is an exercise in futility. By the
time you resume the connections will be broken or at the minimum damaged.
