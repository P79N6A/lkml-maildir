I commented out the two kfree's, and the kernel managed to boot.
But the raid-0 array didn't work.  The boot scripts
tried to fsck it, but couldn't get a valid ext2 superblock.
(fsck -f under 2.5.69-mm8 showed no problems, the fs was clean.)
Then it was mount time.  Various partition and raid-1 based
fses mounted fine, but mounting the raid-0 on /usr/src killed the kernel:
unable to handle kernel NULL pointer deref at virtual address 00000014

Looks like something else is wrong with raid-0.

Were there anything more than removal of the two kfrees?
