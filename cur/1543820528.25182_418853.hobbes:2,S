If you wish to interpret it that way, I won't prevent you :-)
Anyway -- what I meant is that even if somebody writes a patch changing
names to avoid collisions with C++, _merging_ such a patch could be
easily a waste of other people's time, especially when there is no
other advantage in merging such a patch (like if the reason is that
somebody wishes to port his closed-source driver to Linux [*]).
[*]: Not that I'm claiming that this is the case now, but it already
happened.
				Have a nice fortnight
