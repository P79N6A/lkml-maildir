Getting a bit OffTopic(TM) here, but that's why the GNU versions of the tools
wisely added options to output '\0' rather than '\n' as a separator for the
data i.e.
find . -name '12*' -print0 | xargs -0 rm
does exactly what you want it to - no surprises.
The point about arbitrary limits, is, however well taken. The fact that the
space for exec args and environment historically was static and of a fixed
size is not a good reason to perpetuate the limitation.
