Just the fact that calculation itself is nasty.  In the best case you
get (on x86) something like
        sarl    $2, %eax
        imull   $-1431655765, %eax, %eax
(that one is with object size equal to 12).  On other targets it can get
considerably uglier - e.g. on alpha with -O2 the same will result in
        sra $17,2,$17
        s4subq $17,$17,$0
        s8subq $0,$0,$0
        s4addq $0,$17,$0
        sll $0,8,$1
        addq $0,$1,$0
        sll $0,16,$2
        addq $0,$2,$0
        sll $0,32,$1
        addq $0,$1,$0
        addq $0,$0,$0
        addl $0,$17,$0
With -Os it's
        ldah $1,$LC0($29)               !gprelhigh
        sra $0,2,$0
        ldq $1,$LC0($1)         !gprellow
        mull $0,$1,$0
with LC0 in rodata:
$LC0:
        .quad   -6148914691236517205
Now imagine the joy of having a bunch of such wonders in a hot path...
