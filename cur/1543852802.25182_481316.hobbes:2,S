That i think i can help out with. The last time i took a look at the patches
ubuntu applies, one of them was the bd-claim patch. This removes the
functionality preventing multiple "owners" of a block device, thereby allowing
the use of both traditional partitions and device-mapper on the same disk,
something specifically not permitted in the vanilla kernel.
