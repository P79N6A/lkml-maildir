What do you mean by "doesn't work", exactly?  The existing name should
work if you have:
  device "serial_cs" module "8250_cs"
in /etc/pcmcia/config.  With your patch, it would work with:
  device "8250_cs" module "8250_cs"
(and also changing every instance of serial_cs to 8250_cs)

I would say that "serial_cs" is more accurate since this is the driver
for cards that conform to the standard for PCMCIA serial interfaces.
Renaming to "8250_cs" is obfuscatory and pointlessly breaks config
files for previous kernel versions.  It is second in foolishness only
to the genious who thought renaming "ide_cs" to "ide-cs" was a good
idea.
