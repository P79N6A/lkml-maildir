I have promise fastrak tx200, but when i try to enable dma with hdparm -d1
/dev/hda , i have this error HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
Without dma i have a 1,47Mb/s of buffered disk read, and this is not
normal.
What is happend? I need to change my kernel, i use 2.4.18-bf24, from
debian woody 3.0Beta.
Thk.
