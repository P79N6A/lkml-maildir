That reminds me, I seem to be having problems with EHCI in 2.6.6-rc3-mm2 
after a resume. With this: "0000:00:1d.7 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 
82801DB (ICH4) USB2 EHCI Controller (rev 01)" if I suspend & resume with 
APM, then plug in a USB 2.0 device, it won't work at all until I "rmmod 
ehci_hcd; modprobe ehci_hcd". I'd imagine it has something to do with 
these messages:
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: suspend_hc
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: suspend D0 --> D3
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: No PM capability
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.2: suspend D4 --> D3
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.2: suspend_hc
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: suspend D4 --> D3
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: suspend_hc
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.0: suspend D4 --> D3
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.0: suspend_hc
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.0: resume from state D4
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1d.0 to 64
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: resume from state D4
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1d.1 to 64
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.2: resume from state D4
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1d.2 to 64
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: resume from state D0
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: can't resume, not suspended!
Granted, this isn't a huge problem because I can easily work around it 
by reloading the ehci_hcd module. But it's still a little annoying. It 
doesn't look like this has changed as of 2.6.6-mm2 either.
