Isn't that "if possible" bogus.  I thought these two bits
_had_ to be grouped together, at least with the current code.
What happened to the comment that Joel added to gpl.h:
+/* Allocation type modifiers, these are required to be adjacent
+ * __GPF_USER: Allocation for user page or a buffer page
+ * __GFP_KERNRCLM: Short-lived or reclaimable kernel allocation
+ * Both bits off: Kernel non-reclaimable or very hard to reclaim
+ * RCLM_SHIFT (defined elsewhere) depends on the location of these bits
