For the case that started the discussion (wireless network devices).
The expected behavior is that the device remains in a low power state
until it enabled (set to up). If really smart a wired network device
can also stay in low power state until carrier is detected. There are
also other network device states (dormant, lower layer down), not currently
in use that could also be useful.
The point is that using the /sys/device/.../power/state file
is not the right way to handle network devices. Power usage should
correlate to device status, not be controlled differently.
