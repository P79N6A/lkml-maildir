Hi,
 We need to make some or all pages of a shm vm_area as read-protected 
(resetting the USER bit under i386). However, we are encountering 
mysterious hangs on the computers where this is done. Ping still works 
after a hang, but you can't log into the computer. This usually happens 
after running an application two or three times. Tests have mostly been 
done on 2.2.10 and 2.2.11 kernels, but apparently it also exists under 2.2.9.
 My question is: Is there any part of the kernel which checks for this 
flag is a page? What could be the source of these hangs?
 This is for use in the DIPC (
http://wallybox.cei.net/dipc
) package. Any 
help is appreciated.
