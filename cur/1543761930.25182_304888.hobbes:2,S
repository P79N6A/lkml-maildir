It just wants the range of page tables liberated.  I guess
essentially PMD_SIZE is the granularity.
Anyways, for the record I made it only call flush_tlb_pgtables()
when end > start, but instead of that BUG() I now get the BUG()
on mm->nr_ptes being non-zero at the end of exit_mmap().
Something is up with the floor/ceiling stuff methinks.
It's funny since this code aparently works fine on ia64 which
is fully 3-level too.  Hmm...
