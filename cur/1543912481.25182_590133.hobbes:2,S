Exactly right.
The important part in designing isn't the how-to but rather understanding the 
concepts involved.  Once you have the concepts straight, implementation 
becomes a matter of which path to take.

Agreed.  But when I responded to this thread by changing the subject, because 
I felt it was somewhat OT to tracking, I meant to question the mentality of 
trying to nullify design suggestions for the mere reason of not submitting a 
prototype.  Now, prototyping is a great way to refine your end-product, but 
it's a terrible waste of time in terms of articulating design-goals.
IMHO, in the interest of keeping ahead of the competition, we should 
encourage people to express their design suggestions instead of discouraging 
them.
Thanks!
