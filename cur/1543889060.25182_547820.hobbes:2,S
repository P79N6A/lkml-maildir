Sam:
I was noticing some issues with /proc/kallsyms generation on our platform, 
which I noticed after a toolchain update (which I fixed)
However, I had a question in looking at the logic - it looks like the out 
function puts out all symbols - even if they are in the _init section. My
question was should it?
I can see some issues if someone built a module against a function that was
marked as init - when the module loaded - the init code is gone, but the 
symbol is still in the kernel - isn't it? a module would jump to where the
code use to be - which might be something else at the time.
