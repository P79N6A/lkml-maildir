Hi !
What is the status with those patches ?
I have some additional stuff to drop on top of it, including the basic
PPC support, some renumbering of the states as discussed earlier, some
driver fixes etc.... but at this point, I feel it would be more handy
to get those in only after Patrick core changes have been merged with
Linus. Do we wait for 2.6.9 to open ?
Ben.
