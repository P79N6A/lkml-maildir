It wasn't the kernel.
Many thanks to those who helped me track down this problem.
It seems that the 'C' runtime library was trapping the call
to reboot() which probably should have been _reboot() in
earlier code to prevent this. Anyway, the fix is to call
the kernel directly so it doesn't get blamed for something
it didn't do.
Simple external procedure is attached if anybody else is
interested. It ends up being only 0x30 bytes in length.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
