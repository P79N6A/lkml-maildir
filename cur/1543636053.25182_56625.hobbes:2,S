Only if the application is already broken.

In a correctly-written application, neither of these things can
happen.  (See my earlier message today on fsync() and MTAs.)  To get a
file onto disk reliably, the application must 1) flush the data, and
then 2) flush a "validity" indicator.  This could be a sequence like:
  create temp file
  flush data to temp file
  rename temp file
  flush rename operation
In this sequence, the file's existence under a particular name is the
indicator of its validity.
If you skip either of these flush operations, you are not behaving
reliably.  Skipping the first flush means the validity indicator might
hit the disk before the data; so after a crash, you might see invalid
data in an allegedly valid file.  Skipping the second flush means you
do not know that the validity indicator has been set, so you cannot
report success to whoever is waiting for this "reliable write" to
happen.
It is possible to make an application which relies on data=ordered
semantics; for example, skipping the "flush data to temp file" step
above.  But such an application would be broken for every version of
Unix *except* Linux in data=ordered mode.  I would call that an
incorrect application.

A theorist would say that "more safe" is a sloppy concept.  Either an
operation is safe or it is not.  As I said in my last message,
data=ordered (and data=journal) can reduce the risk for poorly written
apps.  But they cannot eliminate that risk, and for a correctly
written app, data=writeback is 100% as safe.
