i'll make one more observation on this, then i'll shut the heck up
about it.
i'm wondering if there's any advantage in defining a code maturity
level as something *beyond* just a regular dependency, as you're doing
above.  what you have above will definitely work, but i'm wondering if
there's some benefit to actually defining a new keyword, such as:
config FUBAR
	depends on ....
	maturity EXPERIMENTAL
while the "maturity" level could still be processed *internally* as a
dependency, if you think about it, it's not *really* a dependency,
it's more like an *attribute* or *status* or something like that, and
it may be that there's some value to distinguishing it from a normal
dependency that's not immediately obvious at the moment.
just thinking out loud.
