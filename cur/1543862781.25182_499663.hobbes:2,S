We do ... in mm/page_alloc.c:
         * This is the last chance, in general, before the goto nopage.
         * Ignore cpuset if GFP_ATOMIC (!wait) rather than fail alloc.
         * See also cpuset_zone_allowed() comment in kernel/cpuset.c.
         */
        page = get_page_from_freelist(gfp_mask, order, zonelist, alloc_flags);
We also allow GFP_KERNEL requests to escape the current cpuset, to the nearest
enclosing mem_exclusive cpuset, which is typically a big cpuset covering most
of the system.
