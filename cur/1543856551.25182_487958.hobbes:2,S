For the record,
cdparanoia III release 10pre0 (August 29, 2006)
works for me. My particular IDE adapter is:
00:0f.1 IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc.
VT82C586A/B/VT82C686/A/B/VT823x/A/C PIPC Bus Master IDE (rev 06)
(prog-if 8a [Master SecP PriP])
I have not tried older versions (yet). Could you try this and see if
things are still broken?
