Sorry for being unclear.  I wasn't seriously recommending no prefix,
due to name collisions (exactly your point), but rather saying that no
prefix is necessary for human understanding.
Something to avoid the ambiguity is still useful.  I was just saying
that it can be pretty much anything withouyt confusing the casual
reader.
We're in violent agreement, I just didn't say it very well the first
time.
