Hi, Alan.
    The patch-file 'patch-2.4.19-pre2-ac3' needs be modified for pdc202xx.c.
In pdc202xx.c, pdc202xx_new_tune_chipset()
switch (speed) to set timing only when UDMA 6 drives exist on ATA-133
controller (PDC20269 and PDC20275). If there are no any UDMA 6 drives
exists, we don't need to set timing here.
    Would you please modify this part?
Thanks and Regards
Hank
