and nobody complains...:-) So, maybe this would be the right fix? At least 
safe in that it cannot break anything:-) But I don't understand that code 
very well. E.g., I don't understand why about 15 lines above the code in 
question
		if (urb->complete) {
			//dbg("process_interrupt: calling completion, status %i",status);
			urb->status = status;
i.e., if (!urb->completion) urb->status is not set, so, depending on 
whether the urb has ->completion either the old or the new status will be 
tested. Is this really correct? And a couple lines above that "goto 
recycle;" is superfluous...
Thanks
