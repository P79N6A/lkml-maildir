Yes, but I'd rather have a generic mechanism that works in all
reasonable cases. Things have a tendency of growing in the oddest
directions. E.g. when introducing the boot command line, all I
had in mind was to have a way to boot single-user mode :-)

Err yes, that's what I wanted to say :) Some new mechanism to
pass the data, or a weird data structure instead of (as opposed
to be on) initrd/initramfs.

Yes, the kexec-based boot loader first, then this. For a
kexec-based boot loader, passing device scan results will be
very useful, plus it's a good environment for experimenting
with such a feature.
