I refer back to the interrupt handler case.  Suppose we have:
while(!atomic_read(flag))
  	continue;
where flag is an atomic_t that is set in an interrupt handler, the 
volatile may be necessary on some architectures to force the compiler to 
re-read "flag" each time through the loop.
Without the "volatile", the compiler could be perfectly within its 
rights to evaluate "flag" once and create an infinite loop.
Now I'm not trying to say that we should explictly use "volatile" in 
common code, but that it is possible that it is required within the 
arch-specific atomic_t accessors even on uniprocessor systems.
