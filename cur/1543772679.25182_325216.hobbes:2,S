Yes, that's how it works, but if I want ext or reiser or whatever to
have NLS, I'll have to make them support it (btw, if I do so, wont it
be rejected?). I want to move the NLS one level upper so the
filesystem imlementations won't have to worry about it any more. I
don't have much kernel experience, and none in the fs area, so I can't
explain it any better, but hope you get the idea.
