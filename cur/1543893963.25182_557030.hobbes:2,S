There's been plenty of times I've wished for that.  Now if we just found a way
to do something sane for drivers/net/wireless/mac80211/iwlwifi/base.c ;)
Of course, I'm probably atypical - for me, kernel messages come in two forms,
the kind that are immediately obvious at first reading, and the kind that
you end up having to look at the code and wonder WTF? it was doing inside
that never-should-happen-on-this-hardware while loop in the first place... :)
