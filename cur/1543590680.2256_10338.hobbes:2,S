Oh yes, I'm well aware it, that's what I mean by the "bullet proofing" 
item on my to-do list.  I don't quite agree with the idea of embedding 
the checking of directory entry format inside the ext2_get_page 
routine, it should be moved outside ext2_get_page, on basic principal.
Never mind that this routine is only used to get pages of directory 
files, it's still not nice.  Anyway, I think the thing to do is graft a 
similar one-time check onto ext2_bread.  We can't use Al's PG_checked 
mechanism because we might have read only one buffer out of several on 
the page.

In any event, I couldn't apply it due to patch giving a 'malformed' 
error - did you edit it after diffing?  I'll wait for a revised patch - 
there's quite a lot of stuff in there including formatting changes, 
ext2 warnings, etc.
