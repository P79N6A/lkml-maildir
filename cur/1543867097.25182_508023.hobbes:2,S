The nsproxy is an implementation detail, actually, and might go away at
any time.  But yes we had been talking for quite awhile about sets of
namespaces as containers, so that a vserver would be a container, as
would a lightweight checkpoint/restart job.

Well it's an unfortunate conflict, but I don't see where we have any
standing to make Paul change his terminology  :)
Lately I've been talking about "Paul's containers", our "namespaces",
and the "namespace container subsystem" in patch 7.

Part 7 does not fall away, it uses Paul's patchset to start to provide
a management interface for namespaces.
