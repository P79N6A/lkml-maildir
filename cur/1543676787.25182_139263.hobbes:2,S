I think it has -- login (or PAM) in most distributions sets the
file size limit to 2GB instead of RLIM_INFINITY. If you are root,
try `ulimit -f unlimited' to see if it helps.

No, it's just the definition of the rlimits. Not leaving them at
RLIM_INFINITY by default is preposterous.
				Have a nice fortnight
