Good news: the tip of plug tree fixed the FC loop reset issue we are
seeing earlier.
Performance wise, our big db benchmark run came out with 0.14% regression
compare to 2.6.20-rc2.  It is small enough that we declared it as noise
level change. Unfortunately our internal profile tool broke on 2.6.20-rc2
so I don't have an execution profile to post.
