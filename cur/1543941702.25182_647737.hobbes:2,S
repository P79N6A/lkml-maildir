I think you're being dishonest.  This isn't really about Linux and it
being licensed under GPL, is it?  Not if you're being 100% honest.  This
is really about Beejay's* kernel module; and you are attempting to force
her to release that under GPL.  You should 'fess up, that the change is
0% technical, 0% unavoidable and 100% political.  This does, of course,
disadvantage Linux with respect to many classes of devices, for example
GSM transceivers when used in those parts of the world^ where regulatory
requirements prohibit modification of power or frequency settings, which
effectively prohibits open-source driver.
An unbending bias towards GPL is impractical in many markets.  It also
hands an additional point or two of market share to Microsoft; who no
doubt will be immensely grateful.

^Probably all of the world.
