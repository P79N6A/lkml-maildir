Yeah, I had the same results, and it fails afterwards because it
reaches the maximum number of watches per user.

Ok, I had a go with it and found the problem. We weren't releasing
one-shot watches because the test for them was wrong. We're using the
event's mask to test for one-shot watches when we should've been using
the watch's mask.
Patch against latest Linus git repo attached.
