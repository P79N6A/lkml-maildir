Josef did specifically state that modification to the lower layers would
be allowed only if a special mount flag is given.

I think that if someone can come up with consistent (and useful)
semantics for a mount option that allows modifications to other layers
as well, it would be a useful additional feature to support.  It seems
that it should be possible to add this feature at a later time in any
case.
Perhaps referring to the plan9 semantics could be helpful.
