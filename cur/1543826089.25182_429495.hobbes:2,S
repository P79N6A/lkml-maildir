Hmm.. I thought my math was reasonable (but there is always so much to learn)
From your formula, if I have 1 task in group A, I need to provide it with
a cap of b/w 10 to 11%. For two tasks, I need to give them b/w 10 to 10.5%.
If I have a hundred, it needs to be b/w 10% and 10.01%

Yes, thats the whole point of the discussion and everybody is free to
participate.
