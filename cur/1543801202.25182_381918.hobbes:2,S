Well, setting the video mode can be done (on x86, ugh) with a BIOS call, so 
we would not need to run through oops-affected code. But that was the 
question, if this int 0x10 call was possible at all. Think of VBE -
VBE3 is the first version that can be done in protected mode.

Right, sad world. (With fun I await the day someone writes a morse encoder 
that writes oops to keyboard leds.)
