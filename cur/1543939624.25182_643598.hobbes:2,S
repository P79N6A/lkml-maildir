Tried it, it worked successfully!
With stock kernel, previous way I had to use it was mem=8832M and top 
showed this:
top - 18:53:52 up 1 min,  2 users,  load average: 1.03, 0.30, 0.10
Tasks: 169 total,   1 running, 168 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
Cpu(s):  6.1%us,  2.6%sy,  4.5%ni, 81.3%id,  5.5%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.0%si,  0.0%st
Mem:   8039464k total,  1288948k used,  6750516k free,     3640k buffers
Swap: 16787768k total,        0k used, 16787768k free,   178528k cached
With kernel you mentioned and use e820 v3:
top - 18:48:13 up 3 min,  6 users,  load average: 1.67, 0.68, 0.25
Tasks: 195 total,   2 running, 193 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
Cpu(s): 18.5%us,  1.2%sy,  1.6%ni, 74.8%id,  3.9%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.0%si,  0.0%st
Mem:   8037668k total,  1438732k used,  6598936k free,     6844k buffers
Swap: 16787768k total,        0k used, 16787768k free,   273928k cached
No append mem= required.
A full dmesg is attached so you can analyze the e820/MTRR mapping.
