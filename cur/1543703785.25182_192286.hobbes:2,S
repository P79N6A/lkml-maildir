hmm, don't know, sorry.  A random kernel crash in a code path which half
the people in the known universe run 100 times per second makes one think
of hardware problems, or a random memory scribble by some other part of the
kernel.
If it is repeatable, try turning on all the memory debugging options in the
"kernel hacking" menu.
