When this was discussed a while ago (maybe on another list?), I
suggested a reserved space at the beginning of each RAID partition.
That seemed to encompass the least amount of work on the part of
everybody.
When installing a kernel, a special ioctl (before any writes occur)
would tell the RAID software that the file being written should be
stored in the special reserved area.  When the file is actually written,
whether it be RAID0/1/5/whatever, the file output is multiplexed to a
reserved space at the beginning of each partition in the md set.
At that point, LILO need only be extended to output to multiple MBRs/boot
sectors, with each MBR pointing to the md reserved space on that
particular drive.  It might need to pass a magic cookie or two to the
kernel to tell md it is booting off a secondary boot sector.
