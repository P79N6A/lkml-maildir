Sorry to spoil the party but I never use Java (am I paranoid or isn't it
about as secure as a paper bag) and I have regular hangs and crashes
(like two-three per week) on 4.06 under 2.0.3x (2.0.35 at present).
I do usually have Javascript turned on, but that's about it.  I use it
for web and mail.
The symptoms are either of "Bus Error" (mostly) to just burning CPU and
doing nothing (occasionally).  Maybe I should strace() it next time it
gets stuck in a loop, but I haven't yet.
