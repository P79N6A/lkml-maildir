And with a LSM module, how can it answer that?  There's no way, unless
we count every time someone calls into our module.  And if you do that,
no one will even want to use your module, given the number of hooks, and
the paths those hooks are on (the speed hit would be horrible.)
I'm with Rusty, just don't let people unload modules, unless you are
running a development kernel, and "obviously" know what you are doing.
thanks,
