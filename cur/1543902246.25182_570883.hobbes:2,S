Subject: [PATCH 0/6] drivers edac tidying-fix-deadlock-sysfs-docs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This EDAC patch set was applied against: 2.6.22-rc6-mm1
6 Patches in this set
1) tidying EXPORT_SYMBOL to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL modes, plus blank line removal
2) workq reset deadlock fix. Moved teardown outside of critical section
3) new i82975x driver for ASUS motherboards submitted.
4) EDAC MAINTAINERs updated for new entries, etc
5) found an old internal EDAC structure that was incorrect in the processing
   of block leaf attributes. Amazing it hadn't faulted, just gave bad data.
   Removed that, and replaced with the correct structure from edac_core.h
   Then refactored code to utilize this structure.
   Error occurred in leaf control/attribute presentation to user
6) Enhanced the EDAC documentation to reflect updated status of EDAC
   including the 'edac_device' class of device, which supports
   non-memory type of ECC hardware detectors.
