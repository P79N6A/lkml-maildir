Gene here.  My impression was that this patch did help in that it appeared to 
clean up what was thought to be less than optimum code in that area.  There 
were a few times when it didn't seem to take quite as many kills and restarts 
of that ill-coded proprietary daemon to make things behave.
OTOH, I get the very strong impression there is another, more serious buglet 
someplace else that does a pretty good job of masking any black and white 
comparisons one might make about this patch.
Older code, as in 4 or 5 minor kernel versions back, appeared to work 
correctly, either on a serial port, or a usb port with a pl2303, if one could 
tolerate the miss-fires it did occasionally.  Now of course the pl2303 seems 
to be broken, both of the ones I have quit working at all with 2.6.21 final.
