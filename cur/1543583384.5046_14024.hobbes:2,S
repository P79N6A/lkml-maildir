How about letting the kernel return ENOEXEC instead of ENOENT? It would
give the luser just the little extra hint about converting their files to
Unix format.
$ ls
testscript
$ head -1 testscript
#!/bin/sh
$ ./testscript
bash: ./testscript: No such file or directory
versus
$ ./testscript
bash: ./testscript: Exec format error
I haven't got a clue what Posix requires though.
