Early userspace is (a) shipped with the kernel source tree and (b) 
linked into vmlinux.  That's integrated.
The firmware images will be separate from the .c files (as they should 
be), but the kernel hacker still controls what gets loaded, and when.
But like I said, that's where we're going, not where we are now.
