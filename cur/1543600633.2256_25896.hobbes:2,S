While I would love to see the network entropy patch merged into 2.4 (its
an option -- plus, since it standardizes the handfull of drivers that
currently _do_ contribute to the entropy pool, its a nice cleanup) I am
aiming for 2.5.
I keep the patch up to date with both Linus's and Alan's tree.  Patches
against the current kernel can be found at

2.4.9-ac10 patches are up.
