I have recent code for that circulating, albeit intended for debugging
purposes. There's nothing particularly debug-oriented about it, though,
apart from the fact a guard page is automatically set up by vmalloc()
and that the use of vmalloc() is unconditional.
As for the rest, I'm sure there could be a lively conversation, but
consensus, so I'll let it go.
