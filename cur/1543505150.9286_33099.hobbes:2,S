NFS v3 for Linux hasn't been used in any of the tests.
There are two problems, not just one:
1)	negative dentry caching or not
2)	live time of negative dentries and under what conditions.
Regarding (1): whether or not this is a problem depends on the
situation. IMNSHO: should be possible to switch this feature off!
Regarding (2) I have tested only a very few combinations of
parameters which affect the behavior:
-	doing a readdir or not.
-	parent dir is >15 minutes old or not
-	stat() calls are repeated within 1 second or not
-	mount options (acregmin, acdirmin, etc)
-	kernel version
-	NFS version
Regarding the mount options I did not use any ac* option. NFS version
is always 2. Readdirs are uncertain (I'm not sure what bash does in
some of the test scripts). Here's the result:
ac11:		infinite negative dentries provided the stat() is
		repeated within every second. This is the case even
		when the parent dir mtime is < 15 minutes old. Once
		the stat() calls stop, there remains a >1 second
		live time for negative dentries. pre4 seems ok.
ac11/pre4	negative dentries for about 30 seconds provided the
		mtime of the parent dir is >15minutes old. No repeated
		stat() in this case.
ac11/pre4	negative dentries for about 1 second otherwise.
