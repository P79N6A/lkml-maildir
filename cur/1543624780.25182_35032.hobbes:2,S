	The problem is that this is intended to be used on machines that are routing 
very high volumes of packets on multiple FEs. So the implementation would 
have to be minimal cost for packets it didn't need to intercept. So I'd need 
to hook into a kernel module or userspace through a filter.
	Does ipchains/iptables support to filter selected packets through userspace 
work? If it does, this might be an acceptable solution.
