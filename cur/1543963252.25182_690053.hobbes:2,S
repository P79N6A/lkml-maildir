Andrea, I'm not interested. I've stated my standpoint: the code being 
discussed is crap. We're not doing that. Not in the core VM. 
I gave solutions that I think aren't crap, but I already also stated that 
I have no problems not merging it _ever_ if no solution can be found. The 
whole issue simply isn't even worth the pain, imnsho.
