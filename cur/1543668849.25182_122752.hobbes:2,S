The only issues with objrmap seems to be mremap, which Hugh
seems to have taken care of, and the case of a large number
of processes mapping different parts of the same file multiple
times (1000 processes mapping each 1000 parts of the same file),
which would grow the complexity of the VMA search from linear
to quadratical.
That last case is also fixable, though, probably best done using
k-d trees.
Except for nonlinear VMAs I don't think there are any big obstacles
left that would keep us from switching to object rmap.
