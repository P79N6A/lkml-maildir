We don't want to have things like config info, or really preferably 
anything that can be used to generate kernel addresses.
Yeah, we've made that mistake before, and I'm not saying we are perfect 
here, but if we make this world-readable, I think it needs to guarantee it 
doesn't really give any rootkit people any new information.
And yes, I do think normal people shouldn't be able to read the vmlinuz 
binary, the same way they are generally not allowed to read /etc/grub.conf 
etc.
