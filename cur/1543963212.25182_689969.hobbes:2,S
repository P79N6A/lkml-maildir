To remove mm_lock without adding an horrible system-wide lock before
every i_mmap_lock etc.. we've to remove
invalidate_range_begin/end. Then we can return to an older approach of
doing only invalidate_page and serializing it with the PT lock against
get_user_pages. That works fine for KVM but GRU will have to flush the
tlb once every time we drop the PT lock, that means once per each 512
ptes on x86-64 etc... instead of a single time for the whole range
regardless how large the range is.
