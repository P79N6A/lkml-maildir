Subject: MSI to memory?

The conventional use of MSI is for a PCI adapter to generate processor
interrupts by writing to a local APIC.  But I've seen some things
that lead me to believe it would also allow an adapter to write to
things other than a local APIC, i.e., to memory.
If so, is that a useful capability that should be exposed through
the Linux MSI interface?
