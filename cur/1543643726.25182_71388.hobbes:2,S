Non-NAPI:
	get-irq-stat
	ack-irq
	get-irq-stat (omit, if no work loop)
NAPI:
	get-irq-stat
	ack-all-but-rx-irq
	mask-rx-irqs
	get-irq-stat (omit, if work loop)
	...
	ack-rx-irqs
	get-irq-stat
	unmask-rx-irqs
This is the low load / low latency case only.  The number of IOs 
decreases at higher loads [obviously :)]
