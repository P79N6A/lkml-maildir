The laptop is an IBM R40 2681-BDG. That means P4 1.8 GHz (non-Centrino), with 
chipset 845.
I own two pc cards, a Cisco Aironet 350 (AIR-PCM352) and a Option Globetrotter 
GSM/GPRS card, driven using serial_cs.
The cards always get correctly recognized in they are already inserted at boot 
time, but rarely if plug them in when my Gentoo has finished booting. To make 
them work a cardctl insert 0 (I only have one socket) usually helps, 
sometimes I have to unload/reload the pcmcia modules, and very very rarely a 
reboot is needed; this happens with 2.6.x and 2.4.25. The two PC Cards behave 
the same, maybe the Cisco one is a bit more picky.
You'll find a complete lspci here:

The kernel config for 2.6.3 here:
http://www.communicationvalley.it/2.6.3-oldradeon.cfg
The kernel config for 2.4.25 here:
http://www.communicationvalley.it/2.4.25.config
I only used pcmcia-cs on a distant past, but I'm downloading them now, I'll 
let you know how they work very soon.
Thanks,
