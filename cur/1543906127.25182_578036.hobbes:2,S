I was at work, on windows maschine. At home, where my linux maschine is
running i use evolution. But that have nothing to do with that.
I also doesnt have any "Backspace" keys stoked. Problem i discovered is
only with SHIFT/CTRL and some times "Right" Buttons.
Issue with "right" ("->") button is realy funny. If you type this button
fast enough it works like double pressed. And if you type it fast few
times (with releasing it) it looks same like if button would be never
released. It doesn't happend with "left"("<-") button :)

As i sad. I wasn't sure if its kernel related at all, it just was worse
first time i booted cfs-v19.1 patch. Now i cant reproduce it even
anymore :)
Maybe thats xorg bug. Or maybe its different on booting.
Anyway HDD IO or CPU usage or System Load doesn't seems to have
influence on it.
