If you had searched the list archives, you would have seen that this
bug has already been fixed. Even if you're too lazy to do that, you
should at least apply the latest pre-patch (2.4.18-pre6 as I write
this) and see if the problem goes away. That's standard procedure:
always try to reproduce an Oops using the latest kernel. 2.4.17 is
over a month old: a lot has happened since then.
