Since this looks to have missed -mm3, I'm going to follow up here (I
hate playing catch-up sometimes).
As has been previously noted, the cond_syscall is only ever cared about
on PPC when you try for !PCI.  And this only happens realistically now,
on MPC8xx (it's usually present on IBM 4xx, and lets ignore APUS).
MPC8xx support has been broken for a while, but hopefully will get fixed
'soon'.
So can we please move this cond_syscall into kernel/sys.c ?
