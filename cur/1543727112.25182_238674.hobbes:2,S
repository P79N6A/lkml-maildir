I too seem to have a font problem in the early boot, I have nothing 
but some flashing as the cursor moves back and forth from kernel 
unpack to the line where it reports setting the default font, at 
which time the screen comes alive and is then readable as the boot 
continues.  This font setup occurs about 4 or 5 lines before the init 
signs on.  This condition has existed since someplace around 2.6.6 
here.  I have the 3 normally used for western english fonts compiled 
in too.  437, iso8859-1, and utf-8.
