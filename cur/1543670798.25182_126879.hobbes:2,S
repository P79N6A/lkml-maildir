I think the problem is that kernel messages should not contain private
information, like ISDN phone numbers.  Why is that even in the kernel?
Are you sure its not in /var/log/messages?  The system log contains more
than just dmesg output.  If it is just syslog stuff, just set
/var/log/messages to 0600.
If it is actually coming from the kernel, I would fix the code that is
printed such private information.
