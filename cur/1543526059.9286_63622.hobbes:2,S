Hi,
LanMedia (www.lanmedia.com) will be releasing an sDSL board in a few
weeks.  I'm just finishing up the device driver right now, and when I'm
done we'll be going into beta test.  I'm not sure if they web site has the
preliminary spec sheets at the moment, but if you email product guys
they can get one.
Andrew
