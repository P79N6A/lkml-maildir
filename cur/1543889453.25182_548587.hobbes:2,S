There are two possibilities of interest I can think of (and maybe both
are useful). One is to deliver a signal to someone on expiry the other
would be to use notifier chains and export either the notifier or
add/remove operations. That allows multiple modules and users to chain
onto the expiry event
Take a look at include/linux/notifier.h
