Then a database accessible via WWW would do... and don't distributions
handle stuff like that? Note that it will be swamped with "XYZ doesn't
work" (or its moral equivalents), even for cases where it _does_ work
(because of user error, broken hardware, ...). Reports of what _does_ work
are hard to come by: My machine works, I'm a happy camper and don't go
hunting all over Internet to say so. Only if it doesn't, I'll start looking
around. So the Hardware-HOWTO and the compatibility lists of distributions
are still your first bet.

Exactly. "Noname NE2000 ISA clones mostly work, some break in mysterious,
sometimes quite entertaining ways" is all you'll get. A detailed,
brand-by-brand breakup is hard (because of the sheer number of brands
around), and even pointless: There have been cases of cards sold under the
same brand, model and so on, that were radically different in makeup.

For high(er) end machines, no HOWTO will be able to help you anyway. Best
bet is getting a local supplier and check the stuff out before buying, or
getting the machine form one of the shops that build Linux machines.
I recently bought a new machine, and it was quite a lot of checking
different sources (Red Hat's pages, XFree86, the various makers of the
pieces, HOWTOs, ...).
