Same mechanism. If I see that foo is nearing the quota I can nohup the
_small_ program that will run through foo's directories every hour and
open everything new. If I'll be in really nasty mood I'll send it to
myself through AF_UNIX socketpair and come out clean on fuser (and avoid
running afoul of descriptor limits). Heavy LART and nearly undetectable
one - fuser comes empty, process doesn't stand out in top or ps output, 
no extra links, no nothing. And quota running down.
