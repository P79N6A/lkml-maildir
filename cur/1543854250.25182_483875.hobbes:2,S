Dear all,
How do I actually low-level format a floppy disk in an 
USB-Floppy-Disk-Drive?
I tried as with usual drives, using fdformat:
[~]>fdformat /dev/sdd
Could not determine current format type: Invalid argument
But setting the format failed as well:
[~]>setfdprm -p /dev/sdd 1440/1440
ioctl: Invalid argument
Next up scsifmt:
[~]>./scsifmt /dev/sdd fmt
scsifmt: non-sense ioctl error
Didn't work too well, too. Any ideas?
Best regards,
Christian
