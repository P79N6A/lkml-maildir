I noticed it when rfcomm(1) segfaulted and caused the oops on startup,
so I straced it. The strace output is:
  [linking stuff snipped]
  socket(0x1f /* PF_??? */, SOCK_RAW, 3 <unfinished ...>
  +++ killed by SIGSEGV +++
According to <net/bluetooth/bluetooth.h> 0x1f is PF_BLUETOOTH and 3 is
PTPROTO_RFCOMM. Looking at the source, rfcomm(1) uses SOCK_RAW for the
RFCOMM control socket (for ioctls: RFCOMMGETDEVLIST, RFCOMMCREATEDEV,
RFCOMMRELEASEDEV, RFCOMMGETDEVINFO), and SOCK_STREAM for the data
sockets.
What is the correct way of doing these ioctls on 2.5 if not against a
SOCK_RAW socket?
