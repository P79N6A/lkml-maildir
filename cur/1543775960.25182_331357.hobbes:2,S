Alan,

OK, the attached patch works for me when sd_mod was loaded with delay_use=1.
Now I'm quite prepared to be told that this is a really horrible and
inapproprate hack (given that I am not a kernel developer, I don't really
know the "correct" way to solve this problem); and I'll cheerfully admit
that it doesn't really solve the problem cleanly as can be seen below:

There are three delays from my patch in the above list, and increasing the
delay to 3 seconds didn't help, as I got three one-second delays.  
However, if someone with the appropriate knowledge could transform my kludge
into a proper fix, then I would be very happy.
Alan, thanks very much for your help - I really appreciate the quick
responses you have given me.
Note that I now have the output from the USB Snoop tool under Windows if
anyone wants it - please ask if needed to help solve the issue "correctly".
