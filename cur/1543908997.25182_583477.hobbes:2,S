Ah wait, that statement is incorrect and may well be the crux of your 
misunderstanding.  Buddy free lists are not exhausted until the entire 
memalloc reserve has been depleted, which would indicate a kernel bug 
and imminent system death.

That we do, but we satisfy the allocations in the vm writeout path 
first, without waiting for shrink_caches to do its thing.
