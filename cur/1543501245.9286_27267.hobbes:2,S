As written, that should miss EVERY message. The probable correct
version thereof would be...
 Q> * ^TO.*linux-kernel@vger
...but that will only catch emails with linux-kernel in the TO list,
not those with it in the CC or BCC lists - nor, for that matter, those
with "To" lines instead of "TO" lines - both regularly occur. OK, you
can add a set to catch the "To", "CC" and "Cc" versions thereof, but
not the BCC version...
Best wishes from Riley.
