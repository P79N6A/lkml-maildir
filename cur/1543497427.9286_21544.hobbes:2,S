   running 2.3.4 I get the following message:
   wait_on_bh, CPU 1
   irq: 0 [0 0]
   bh:  1 [1 0]
   <[c0109625]> <[c01627b1]> <[c016d5a6]> <[c0174973]> <[c015e1cf]> <[c0174e06]>
Thanks for the report, I understand what is going wrong.
Alexey Kuznetsov and myself are working on patches to fix this up for
the 2.3.5 timeframe.
Later,
