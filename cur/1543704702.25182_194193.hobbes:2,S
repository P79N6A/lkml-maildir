Hi Andrew,
Moving trap_init() before parse_args() makes the "gdb" command line
option work.
On the i386 George has a few lines of code in breakpoint() which do 
enough setup to allow a break point trap to enter kgdb early in the
boot.  I played with similar code on x86_64, but it didn't work.
Handling a break point trap requires some of the initialization
done in cpu_init().  I suspect the difference is the per-cpu-data
referenced using %gs.
