Separate in terms of providing clear semantics in the API, so that you 
know a hook is either used for housekeeping (allocation, deallocation etc) 
or for access control.  But this is only an aim, an if it makes sense to 
combine housekeeping and access control functions in some specific 
instance, then so be it.

I thought this was generally called before key operations.
For example, sys_add_key() calls it with KEY_WRITE against the destination 
keyring.

SELinux does not audit object creation, it will sometimes use a _post hook 
to update its internal state or perform the access control check for 
creating the object.
