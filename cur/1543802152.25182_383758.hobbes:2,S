Subject: [patch 0/2] x86-64 memory hot-add support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following this mail are two memory hotplug patches.  The first
adds __meminit to the __init lineup to ensure that functions
needed for memory hotplug remain available if CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG
is enabled but default to __init otherwise.  The second patch is
the reworked x86-64 specific patch for memory hot-add on single
node (non-NUMA) systems updated with Andi's suggestions.  These
changes are specifically isolated to x86-64.  
Patches are against linux-2.6.15.  Patches have been tested for
logical operations as well as physical memory hot-add operations
Please review and consider queuing to -mm for additional testing.
Thanks...
