That would be the idea (more or less).  After all, the kernel does not have
a crypto API at all in comparison to OpenSSL and 'everyone' is using OpenSSL
as their SSL, etc. library.  An OpenCrypt library incorporating OpenSSL and
mcrypt as well as mhash might be perfect for an all-crypto-API system which
could then do the hooks to accelerator cards.  The accelerator cards would
have kernel drivers, but the library would do the offloading calls.  There
is no reason to kernel-space this work.
