I've gotten the Xserver fixed. any ideas on the dquot crash? I assume it's
something to do with quotas, which I do have enabled (this is a mail
server and serves smtp and pop3(via qpopper)).
It looks like dquot-max is set to 256.
I watched dquot-nr and it's gotten up to "448     320" (i had to increase
the max to 500) and it continues to increase.
