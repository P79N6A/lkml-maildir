I sent out a V3 queue today, but the aggregate of my queue and Venki's
HPET stuff + HPET force enable for non Intel chip sets is available as a
full queue here:
http://www.tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.22-rc4-mm2/patch-2.6.22-rc4-mm2-hrt6.patches.tar.bz2
I can resend the 40 patches if you want, but they are out on LKML
already (-hrt and the hpet ones), so there is little value to spam
everyones inbox with the same stuff again.
