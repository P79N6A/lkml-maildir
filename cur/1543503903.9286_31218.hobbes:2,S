Linux may die horribly if it allows the RT task to enter kernel mode.
So we would have to put guards on all kernel entry points 
    if running rt process (note current will not be useful)
       then 
            call rt scheduler with error indication
the rt scheduler would then mark the current rt task with an error 
condition and let it handle it. We'd bypass the linux scheduler entirely
and would have to add a RT call
                run_user_mode_process(p);
Doesn't sound so bad now. A error would basically loose RT functionality: that seems 
ok. But it would require a bigger Linux patch.
I described this idea to Linus and it made him deeply unhappy.
