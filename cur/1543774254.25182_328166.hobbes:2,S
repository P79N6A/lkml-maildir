Sure, the main udev target is not the embedded world, just because there
is not such a big requirement to adapt a system to so many possible changes
that a desktop system or big servers seeing today.
But we have prepared the kernel with hotplug-events over netlink and a
full featured environment carried with the event. Instead of whining
about devfs going, start implementing your own tiny "udev" that even works
without sysfs at all:
  o Set /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug to "".
  o Create a single daemon that listens for netlink/events. Use $MAJOR $MINOR
    from the environment and create a node.
  o Define a simple kernel-name <-> node-name + action lookup table in the daemon
    If an action is defined, fork an event with the environment of the received
    netlink/event and handle the event externally.
  o For bootup, embedded setups can probably just use the minimal required set
    of nodes, which are copied over to the tmpfs /dev - mount. After
    real userspace is up, the daemon will take care of maintaining /dev.
That way, you have a nice replacement for devfs, /sbin/hotplug and using
$MODALIAS a replacement for most of the hotplug scripts.
Based on udevd.c in the current udev-tree one can do this in less than a
week, still enough time before devfs is removed. :)
Thanks,
Kay
