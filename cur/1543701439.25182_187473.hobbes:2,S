I have a G550.  Two framebuffers works fine, but the boot default is to
show /dev/fb0 on both heads.  I guess this is because you never know
what connector people with a single monitor uses.  (Unnecessary,
because the bios only activates one output...)
Get the matroxset utility, it is used to set up which framebuffer
(fb0 or fb1) is displayed on what connector.
X and everything works fine once this is set up right.
You can do early checking by catting two different files into
/dev/fb0 and /dev/fb1, you'll see different "garbage" appear
on either screen.
