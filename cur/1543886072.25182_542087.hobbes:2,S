True.

In case of Freecom FSG-3, that would be four USB-ethernet adapters. With 
the cost roughly half of the cost of the whole device. And all USB-ports 
occupied. Provided you don't use them for something else.
Someone could ask "why has this device four mice connected?" :) (for 
someone who doesn't work much with computers, a USB-ISDN or USB-ethernet 
adapter looks just like a mouse).
And yet another viable alternative is to use a totally different device 
which is fully supported under Linux or another system, right? :)
