Hello everybody
Problem Statement: Command to lock the processor with a specific task or
function & disable the scheduler from preempting the function untill the
task reaches its completion.
Probable Solutions :using         1)spin_lock & spin_unlock
                                    2)lock_kernel & unlock_kernel
                              3)cli(for disabling the timer interrupt to
the scheduler)
                                          4)disable_irq(0) &
enable_irq(0)(for the same reason stated above)
Issues: Unable to create test stubs or scenarios where the processor is
scheduled between several processes, since a sleep command relinquishes the
processor voluntarily & a loop ties the processor till its completion.
Required Solutions: Either the generation of suitable test stubs or a new
solution catering to our needs.
Thank you.
