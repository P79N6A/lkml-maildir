Subject: Too restrictive permissions on some files prevent non-root build (with KBUILD_OUTPUT) [bug 2669]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I still cannot understand which is better to post bugs here or on the bugzilla, so I'll try both this time.
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2669
The problem is that several files were not world readable and this prevents non-root builds by using the new KBUILD_OUTPUT variable.
For 2.6.6 the files in question can be found by:
cd /sometempdir
tar xjf linux-2.6.6.tar.bz2
find linux-2.6.6 ! -perm -004 -exec ls -l {} \;
I guess the one that most people need is the linux-2.6.6/drivers/char/agp/isoch.c
To fix your tree you can (safely?) use:
find /usr/src/linux-2.6.6 ! -perm -004 -exec chmod o+r {} \;
No idea how exactly the tarball is build, but there can be a check proces like the above before making it final.
Kalin.
