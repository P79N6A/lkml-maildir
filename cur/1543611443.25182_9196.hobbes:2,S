I had this kind of deadlock on a MSI-6215 (i815) running in console mode (no X).
It always happened during screen blanking while there was interrupt load
(networking via ISDN). APM based screen blanking didn't work so I suspected APM
but at least this is only half true at maximum. The system does run fine with
APM but no APM screen blanking, if you disable console blanking completely by
issuing:
echo -n -e "\033[9;0]\033[10;0]\033[11;0]\033[14;0]"
during the boot sequence, i.e. output to /dev/console (beeps silenced too but I
do believe this can be ignored). By now I do suspect the console blanking code
to be the trigger of the lockup, not the APM code.
