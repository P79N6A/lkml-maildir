Where is the code using it?  Without examples of use there's no way to
tell whether it's bogus or not.
As it is, it looks like massive hook-adding exercise with no clear goal.
The same goes for ..._raw variants of the methods - yes, something in
that direction would make sense; however, splitting the codepath on the
top level looks like a bloody bad idea.  _IF_ we get hooks of that sort,
the right thing to do is to provide helpers and make normal filesystems
use them, passing current foo_mknod et.al. as callbacks.  And in any
case, that needs discussing - it's not obvious that "let's take over
entire work past lookup of parents" is the best choice here.
Again, without examples of users for that stuff you are asking for blind
change of API I'm really not comfortable with.
