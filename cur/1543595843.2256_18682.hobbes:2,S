Same here; I just debugged these on S/390 ...

I think the -pre6 code should be OK.  Note that the crash in
proc_delete_inode() occurs because the pointer to the parent
proc_dir_entry (which is taken from inode->u.generic_ip) is
non-zero.
In 2.4.5, this is the case because proc_pid_make_inode
assigns a value to inode->u.proc_i.task before calling iput().
That field overlays inode->u.generic_ip ...
In the 2.4.6-pre patches, the test for a zero pid is moved to
*before* assigning to inode->u.proc_i.task.  Therefore, when
iput calls proc_delete_inode(), the 'de' pointer will be
zero, and nothing will happen.
Whether this is particularly pretty is debateable, but it
appears to be correct.
