The locking primitives are inlined for performance, and radically different
in both cases. The UP kernel has a definite advantage speedwise by _not_
handling SMP locks. Your idea is to compile everything as SMP then?

And for large memory, and not. And for i386, i486, i586 and i686. And so
on. Get real.
