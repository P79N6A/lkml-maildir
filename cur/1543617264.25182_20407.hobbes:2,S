He didn't.  If you want to do that, run "make menuconfig" instead of "make 
autoconfigure".
Autoprobing is just another tool at your disposal, you don't have to use it.  
And you can probe for your hardware and then menuconfig what it found (run 
"make autoconfig menuconfig"., and see my previous post for a small gripe 
about this. :)

Trust me, if I thought there was ANY code I could write that would make cute 
single women start using the Linux kernel en masse...
Right now I'm going for reformed MCSEs who are still largely clueless but now 
have Linux+ certification and a boss who wants to spend his department's six 
figure budget on something OTHER than a microsoft audit.  Autoprobing might 
help us convert a few of that crowd.
