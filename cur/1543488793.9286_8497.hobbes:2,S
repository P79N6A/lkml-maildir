Then we agree.  I think that disributed shared memory machines hide too much
from the application programs.  If there is a way for a program to find out if
a particular operation is going to be expensive or not then maybe I'd support
it.
If course, if you write your program in such a way that you don't depend on
fast access to certain regions of memory and only touch them when you are
explicitly communicating or syncronizing with another node, then maybe it
could be argued that DSM makes the implementation of message passing easier.
This was done by DEC.  The implemented a DSM subsystem but were careful to
warn programmers to only use it as a communication facility between nodes and
to not trust the subsystem for sequential consistency.

That kind of thinking is VERY architecture dependent.  There are DSM
subsystems that are not page granular; you can find a variety of systems that
will allow you to specify a single byte as a shared memory object and
serialize access to that object.
