Hi,
I've got a machine with an ARC-1110 SATA RAID controller in it, and I'm 
experiencing problems when the driver is built in the kernel.
The problem appears on all versions I've tried, including the latest -mm, 
and a hacked-up version from Areca's website.
Description
: issuing a shutdown / halt on the system spits out FS erros after 
'Halting System' and before 'System halted', due to the fact it is 
performing IO to a device that is considered dead :
 0:0:0:0: rejecting I/O to dead device
EXT3-fs error (device sda1): ext3_find_entry: reading directory #65203 
offset 0
device always seems to be sda1, which is mounted on / on this machine. 
Since the action is a read-only one on a read-only FS, I haven't seen any FS 
corruption so far.
kernel :
2.6.15-mm1
2.6.15 + hacked up ARC-1xxx driver from the website.
Relevant .config stuff : 
CONFIG_SCSI_ARCMSR=y
CPU : dual Xeon 3.2 Ghz
Mem : 4GB (This isn't a PAE kernel yet)
I can post the fill .config and a dmesg log of desired, just let me know.
regards,
	Igmar
