Subject: [patch] fix for non-monotonic gettimeofday caused by broken 8254 chip
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Ok, the kernel is not to blame for my broken hardware, but I have found
a reliable way to work around my problem.  I'm hoping that others
that have reported the same problem will have success with my patch.
The problem: on 386 and 486 machines, the kernel must use the 8254
hardware timer chip to interpolate time between jiffies.  The timer
gives a continuously decrementing count from 0x2e9b to 0.  The count is
read as two bytes in sequence: LSB then MSB from the same port (0x40).
On my 486F38X "Mother" brand vesa-local-bus motherboard, for some
unknown reason, stressing the machine can cause the alternating
sequence of LSB and MSB reads to get 1 byte out of synch, effectively
causing the counter values to get byte-swapped.
The symptom: gettimeofday() is not monotonic.  It makes small jumps
backwards in time, producing a "sawtooth" progression.  Programs
that calculate time deltas hang for hours or days.  xclock stops
moving, netscape (aside from its other bugs) freezes, general havoc.
The solution: If we detect a count above the valid maximum (0x2e9b for
HZ=100), then do one extra read to put us back in synch.  This 
fix works for me.  This one byte correction is only occasionally
needed on my machine (perhaps once per hour or so).  It should not
noticeably decrease performance for others with non-broken timers.
It will not affect any processors other than i386 and i486.
Many thanks to Ingo Molnar and Colin Plumb for their guidance.
