The man page then goes on to say "the error ENOTCONN is returned when the 
socket was not actually connected". Admittedly, this is not what my patch 
does; it returns ENOTSUPP, as do SOCK_STREAM sockets.

This was, after all, the point of the patch. Well, that and closing the 
security hole opened by my earlier patch :-)

I would say that ENOTSUPP all the time would be more sensible. However, my
choice of error codes was determined by the ones used by SOCK_STREAM.
SOCK_SEQPACKET and SOCK_STREAM should use the same error codes, I would 
say. Further, they should use the codes specified by POSIX.

That seems eminently sensible. Again, I was just cut-n'-pasting from
SOCK_STREAM. If these error codes are wrong, then SOCK_STREAM also needs
fixing.

IMHO, there never was an SELinux bug here. SELinux merely exposed an 
existing bug.

I'm unable to reproduce that, or the bug you mention in your other

I think that af_unix.c needs a bit of cleaning up. All of the functions 
are named as being stream vs dgram, even when the issue is connectionless 
vs connection-oriented. For example, unix_connectionless_connect would 
make a lot more sense than unix_dgram_connect. sendmsg and recvmsg are the 
worst since they require a mixture of SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM 
semantics. It would be nice to rewite unix_dgram_recvmsg and 
unix_stream_recvmsg as four helper functions dealing with the 
connectionless, connection-oriented, datagram and stream operations and 
then have 3 wrapper functions (one for each socket type) calling the 
appropriate helpers. This is all strictly IMHO, of course.
