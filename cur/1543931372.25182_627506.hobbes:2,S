I'm applying Adrian's patch. All code under radio/ depends on VIDEO_DEV.
I don't like this approach, since it doesn't seem to be a good idea
force all kernel compilations to look under all the +200 drivers
under /media. Yet, better to slow down the compilation than to broke it.
To me, the proper solution is to move the code that can be used by
either DVB or V4L to a common place, and making the common place
dependent of VIDEO_DEV | DVB_CORE. Seems to late at -rc cycle for doing
this.
