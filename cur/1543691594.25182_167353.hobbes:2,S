	I noticed that contrary to what was happening with 2.4.x kernel, suid

	Is this the intended behaviour or a bug ?
	Example :
	[root@localhost test]# chown root ~cartaljp/test/suid_test
	[root@localhost test]# chmod 4775 ~cartaljp/test/suid_test
	[root@localhost test]# exit
	[cartaljp@localhost test]$ cp /bin/ls suid_test
	[cartaljp@localhost test]$ ls -l
	total 72
	-rwsrwxr-x    1 root     cartaljp    67668 Sep 19 07:56 suid_test <- 
	Suid bit is still set whereas with 2.4.x kernel it was reset.
Yes. Here 2.4 had the terrible code
     mode = (inode->i_mode & S_IXGRP)*(S_ISGID/S_IXGRP) | S_ISUID;
while 2.6 does things via notify_change().
However, in 2.6 notify_change() does not allow removal of the SUID bit
because you are not owner of the file :-).
So, we have to convince inode_change_ok() to do it anyway.
Below a patch.
