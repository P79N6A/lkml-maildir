I'm running 2.6.28.1 on an i686 (slackware-12.1 for the most part) box.
I recently added some extra memory, expanding from 2Gb to 4.  Everything
works as expected except that not all of the memory seems to be seen.
free returns:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers
cached
Mem:       3374860    2099504    1275356          0      86612
1032024
-/+ buffers/cache:     980868    2393992
Swap:       497972          0     497972
and cat /proc/meminfo gives:
MemTotal:        3374860 kB
MemFree:         1199184 kB
Buffers:           86816 kB
Cached:          1036240 kB
SwapCached:            0 kB
Active:          1375864 kB
etc.
On the other hand, user-space tools like lshw show the 4 1Gb DIMMS as
does the BIOS configuration boot menu.
One suspicion is that the configure option CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y
should be unset and the CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G  should be.
Any help would be appreciated, as would a separate CC since I don't
subscribe to the list.
Thanks in advance
David
