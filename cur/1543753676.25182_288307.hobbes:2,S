historically spinlock.h had the full implementation of both spinlock
variants: spinlocks and rwlocks. (hey, you implemented it first and put
it there! :-) Then came Ben's rwsems that wanted pieces of rw-spinlocks,
so rwlock.h was created with the shared bits.
one thing i was thinking about was to move most but the assembly to
asm-generic/spinlock.h. Almost every architecture shares the spinlock
type definitions and shares most of the non-assembly functions.
