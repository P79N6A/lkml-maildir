Hi...
Apart from this, 2.6.9-mm1 is fairly stable (Congrats!), I use it as
samba server and is working fine. But sometimes I get this, and the
box gets unresponsive:
Nov  6 04:05:54 nada kernel: ata5: command timeout
Nov  6 04:06:19 nada kernel: hde: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x24
Nov  6 04:06:29 nada kernel: hde: DMA interrupt recovery
Nov  6 04:06:29 nada kernel: hde: lost interrupt
Any ata5 is a SATA channel on the second of two Promise cards.
Any ideas ?
