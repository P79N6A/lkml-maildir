Larry, could you also please clarify one specific point about the NWL
- whether the phrase 'this product or any other products' includes
future products released by BitMover, Inc. after a third party has
agreed to the license or just products released up until the point
that the third party accepts the license.
I.E. if somebody accepts the NWL now, are they permitted, (in terms of
the NWL), to whine about a, (hypothetical), new product that you
release next year, without violating the license?
John.
