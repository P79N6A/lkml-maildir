Oops I'm sorry if I made it sound like there's a dynticks problem. That was 
not my intent and I said as much in an earlier email. Even though I'm finding 
myself defending code that has already been softly tagged for redundancy, 
let's be clear here; we're talking about at most a further 70ms delay in 
scheduling a niced task in the presence of a nice 0 task, which is a 
reasonable delay for ksoftirqd which we nice the eyeballs out of in mainline. 
Considering under load our scheduler has been known to cause scheduling 
delays of 10 seconds I still don't see this as a bug. Dynticks just "points 
it out to us".
