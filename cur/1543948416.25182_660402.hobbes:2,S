I have the same problem - it is not debian specific.  Did the
semantics of kill() change with the new kernel?  I thought as long as
something is setuid, even with capability stuff around the setuid
programs just get _all_ capabilities and would keep working.
I did a good search and found many people with the problem, but no
solutions except going back to 2.6.23.x kernels.  I guess you'll flame
me, but at least include a link to the solution too.
