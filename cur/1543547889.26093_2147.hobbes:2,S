Hi,
I have been using Linux since the early days... and recently that I have
installed RH6.2 with Linux kernel 2.2.16 on my Dell laptop (P3-500,
256MB RAM).  One thing that I found is the networking performance
between this Linux box and all my Solaris 7 based servers are very very
slow.  I only get around 7-10k/s transfer rate over 100-BT link.  I have
desperately searched all the websites that I can think of to find any
answers, but none helpful.  Here is a detailed problem description:
Linux box:
	-- Dell P3-500Mhz, 256 RAM
	-- RH 6.2
	-- Kernel 2.2.14, 2.2.16, and I compiled 2.4.0-test7
	-- Xircom CardBus Combo card 100/BT
Solaris 7
	-- Most high-end servers E4500 and above
	-- 100BT or Giga-Ether
Doing a FTP or HTTP from Linux to Sun, transfer rate is around 3-10K/s. 
If I do FTP to another Linux box, the transfer rate is at least 1000k -
3000k/s
Booting the laptop into Win2000, file transfer from it and Sun is at
least 1000K/s, normally 3000k/s.
I heard it might be Solaris TCP window scaling issue... how do I solve
this besides telling me to switch from Linux to FreeBSD, which I will
not do.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Jack
PS:  By email to this mailing list is a desperate attempt to solve this
problem...  Please cc to my email address directly since I am not on the
mailing list.  Thanks!
