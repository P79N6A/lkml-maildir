   If you look at pppoatm_send(),  you'll see that you do an
   skb_realloc_headroom if there's no space for the headers.   If
   pvcc->chan.hdrlen is set properly then this will be the exceptional,
   rather than the common case.
Their problem is on receive, not send.  That's problematic because in
that case the ATM drivers allocate and size the SKBs.
