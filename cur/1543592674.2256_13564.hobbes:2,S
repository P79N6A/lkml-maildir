The user-mode port of 2.4.5 is available.
The network drivers have been completely redone.  If you've tried to set up 
UML networking and failed, try it again.  There's a new helper which will do 
most of the host-side setup for you.  The easiest way to get it is to install 
the RPM.  It's also available from CVS.  See 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge
.net/networking.html for all the details.
A number of other bugs have been fixed, as well.
The project's home page is

Downloads are available at

=429 and
