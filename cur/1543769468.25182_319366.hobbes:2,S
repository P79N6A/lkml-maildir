Does this include support for UNIX sockets and named pipes?  One of
the issues I have with filesystems like AFS and NFS is that they
should theoretically make such things possible, but the code is not
implemented yet and does not appear it ever will be.  This is very
useful for home directories when using programs like "links" that
rely on being able to create UNIX sockets in .links/socket or
similar.
