The interface being probed is by definition not going to be claimed
by any other driver ... it shouldn't check or claim that interface.
That test has always been buggy -- better to just remove it.  For
that matter, usb_interface_claimed() calls should all vanish ... it's
better to fail if claiming the interface fails (one step, not two).
Care to try an updated patch?
This started to matter because as of RC1, usbcore got rid of the last of
some pre-driver-model code for driver binding.  There might be a similar
bug in the ALSA usb audio driver, according to 'grep'.
