Yeah I kinda overlooked vm_unacct_memory 'til I wondered why I had put
the inlines in the header file earlier :).  But I do have the profiles
and checking on all calls to vm_unacct_memory, I find there is no 
regression at significant callsites.  
I can provide the detailed profile if required,
but here is the summary for 4 runs of kernbench -- nos against routines
are profile ticks (oprofile) for 4 runs.
