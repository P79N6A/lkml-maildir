There's no reason it couldn't be made tunable, though we may want to
place restrictions on what values are allowed, e.g. reserved_pids > 0
and reserved_pids < min(BITS_PER_PAGE, pid_max). For that matter, we
should likely be using proc_dointvec_minmax() for pid_max or otherwise
a custom strategy function if we need to update bounds on reserved_pids
and/or reserved_pids in tandem. I suspect this is obscure enough I
should leave it alone unless someone develops a strong opinion about it.
