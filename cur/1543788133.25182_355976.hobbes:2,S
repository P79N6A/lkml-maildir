Ok, I think this is cristal clear to me, now. :)

Your task will be to prove that the kernel they upload to your box is a
modified Linux kernel (by "modified Linux kernel", I mean no modules but
the kernel itself).
So, the first step would be to catch/sniff this binary image, then
analyze it.
But, as long as you cannot prove that Free has done internal
modifications to the Linux kernel which are not released in any way,
your case is quite thin.
