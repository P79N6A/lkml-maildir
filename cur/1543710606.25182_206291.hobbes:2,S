FInd out what's adding all of the netfilter rules like crazy.
It is obvious this is happening, from your profiles.  I know you
say that you have no idea what might be doing it, but your description
matches every other one that was reported in the past of gradual
networking slowdown, and in each of those cases it was something
poking netfilter in some way, and your profiles basically
confirm that this is what is happening somehow on your box.
