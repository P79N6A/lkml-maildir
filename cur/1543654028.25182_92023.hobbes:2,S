Linux version 2.5.49 (zwane@montezuma.mastecende.com) (gcc version 3.2
20020903 (Red Hat Linux 8.0 3.2-7)) #17 SMP Sat Nov 23 15:39:24 EST 2002
What i get at boot is;
kernel /vmlinuz ro root=/dev/hda1
...
VFS: Cannot open root device "hda1" or 00:00
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 00:00
in init/do_mounts.c:/try_name() i get -ENOENT for sys_stat(/sys/block/hda)
i finally hacked in the ROOT_DEV to make it boot and /sys shows;
root@mondecino /sys {0} find -name hda\*
./hda
./hda/hda2
./hda/hda1
root@mondecino /sys {0} ls -l block
total 0
All the block devices are in the toplevel directory of /sys. I have
another SCSI based (/dev/sda1 root device) test box (I use the same
kernel on all boxes) which shows the following and has all its block
devices in /sys/block;
root@linux /sys {1} find -name hda\*
./block/hda
./block/hda/hda1
root@linux /sys {0} find -name sda\*
./block/sda
./block/sda/sda2
./block/sda/sda1
The odd part is that the failing test box's drive used to be in another
box, which used to boot in .48
If you need any more info please give me a holla.
