That makes sense. Snoop can effectively turn a read into a write.

Exactly that happens on x86. Normally prefetches stop on TLB miss,
but the CPU can do speculative TLB fetches too.
Also even without any prefetching the CPU does speculative execution
and that can lead to random addresses being followed.
