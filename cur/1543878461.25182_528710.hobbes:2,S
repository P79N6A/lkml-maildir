Please go read the NFS spec. The only thing an NFS client has in order
to read a directory is a READDIR operation that in essence takes a
filehandle and a cookie as its arguments. Unless the server is able to
return the entire rest of the directory in one RPC reply, the client
needs to send a second READDIR operation with a cookie from the previous
READDIR operation. The server is expected to return cookies for _each_
entry in the directory.
That is a protocol limitation, not a client limitation.
