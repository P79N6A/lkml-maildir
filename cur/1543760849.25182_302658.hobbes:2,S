Hi,
i have a pc with five ethernet devices onto and want to resend ethernet packets coming in from one device to four direct neighbours (distance 1). Therefore i have installed a packet handler receiving skbs.
Now i have the following questions:
1) is it enough to change the skb->dev to the output device, rebuild the ethernet header and call dev_queue_xmit()?
2) how to i get the destination ethernet address of the physically direct neighbour within the packet handler? I believe, that i have to use the neighour caches but have not idea how...
Any help would be appreciated!
Bye
Matthias
