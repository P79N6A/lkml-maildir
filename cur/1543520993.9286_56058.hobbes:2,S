Hi all,
Please help me with this persistent conundrum.
First, my setup:
Hardware:
-Dual PPro's on Tyan 1668D
-NetGear FA310TX (Tulip) on 10mb hub network
Unless I run my machine in 2.0.36 ump, I cannot
use my pci ethernet interface.  Pinging localhost
and the local ip address are fine, but anything
outside the loopback device does not work, even
pinging the gateway.  The routing tables are correct
as are the IRQ's reported in /proc/interrupts.
See below:  (NOTE the hardware address reported
by arp!)
# netstat -rn

                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
Why hasn't the hardware address of this card
been determined?  I'm sure this is my problem
now.  Is this a bug or a loose screw behind the
keyboard?
Note, I've tried every software configuration
I could think of:
-Dozens of combinations of kernel configs using
 2.2.5 up to 2.2.14 (smp)
-I've tried the tulip driver contemporary to each
 kernel release as well as the newest available
Thanks!
