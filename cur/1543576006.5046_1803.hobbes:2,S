Hi,
The sound (emu10k1) seems to be broken under 2.2.18.
If I do:
	cat x > /dev/dsp
I get:
	bash: /dev/dsp: No such device
But an ls -l shows:
crw-rw-rw-   1 root     sys       14,   3 Dec 15 21:25 dsp
crw-rw-rw-   1 root     sys       14,  19 Dec 15 21:25 dsp1
Same thing with xmms and mpg123.  There were no problems under 2.2.17.
Thanks
ttyl
Dima
