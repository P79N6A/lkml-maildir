Really interesting question is why do we need two toolchains at all.
Note that little-endian m32r gcc at least appears to understand
-mbe/-mbig-endian and binutils handles both endianness just fine.
Does that really work and is there any reason why big-endian one
could not handle -mle the same way with minimal changes?  IOW, do
they have to differ in anything except the default target endianness?
Note that dependencies on "host endianness == target endianness" are
practically guaranteed to cause bugs in cross-compiler, so any of
those would very likely to be a bug in need of fixing anyway...
