Applied your fixes to tip/irq/sparseirq:
 e81838d: sparc64: Fix build by using kstat_irqs_cpu()
 623d3f0: sparc64: Fix build by including linux/irq.h into time_64.c
thanks David!

Yes, but every time someone tries to clean those dependencies up, it gets 
held up by non-genirq architectures:
 /*
  * Please do not include this file in generic code.  There is currently
  * no requirement for any architecture to implement anything held
  * within this file.
  *
  * Thanks. --rmk
  */
Meanwhile that particular comment is moot because ARM is genirq - but 
there's a handful of other non-genirq architectures so this area of code 
continues to be a mess.
I guess we could move all the APIs to kernel_stat.h. Yinghai?
