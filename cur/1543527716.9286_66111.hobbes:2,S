The ->end callback is deadlock prone actually (that probably can't be
reproduced on x86 though because of the ack and because irq gets delivered
only to one cpu). The ->end callback has to check if the irq is been
disabled as it's doing in 2.3.48, but it _has_ also to check if the irq is
currently in progress (and it wasn't doing that).
What was happening to my machine is that I was locking up in __sti() in
handle_IRQ_event() due irq recursion.
	CPU0				CPU1
	-------------------		------------
	do_IRQ
	set inprogress
	->ack (disable_irq
					do_IRQ
					spin_lock
	spin_unlock
					got the lock
					is inprogress so goto end
					->end
					it's not disabled so enable_irq()!!
	handle_IRQ_event
	__sti()
	lockup: irq was enabled
			
This is the fix. But don't apply it yet. I'll include it along with the
all other platform updates. Now I am running 2.3.48+alpha irq affinity and
cleanups and it's rock solid here ;). I changed also the x86 since it
looks more robust and more correct.
