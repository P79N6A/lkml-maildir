Hi Scott,
This looks great.  Any chance of releasing documentation on the crypto
hardware which resides on the PRO/100 S?  We're currently looking at
adding support for hardware crypto (including IPsec offload) to the
kernel, and it would be good to include the requirements and capabilities
of this card in the design process.
