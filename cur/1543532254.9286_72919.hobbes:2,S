Sorry for starting another Linux mm related thread, but I have a question
for mm gurus:
is swap space made availble after a page-in operation? When the page 
is mapped to a page-frame, there's no need to hold a copy on swap.
Can such a swap space be reclaimed when the system is low on swap?
On old BSD system, i'm pretty sure the swap space is deallocated only
at process termination.
.TM.
