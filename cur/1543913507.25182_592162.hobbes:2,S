If a device has a <name>.<instance> scheme this implies possibility of
having several instances of said device in a box. There are a few of
platform devices that can only have one instance - for example i8042
keyboard controller (the -1 special handling came from me because
i80420 name was very confusing - there wasn't a dot separator in the
name back then). Drivers that allow multiple devices should not
attempt to use -1 for the very first instance - this should eliminate
potential for error and special handling that you are talking about.
