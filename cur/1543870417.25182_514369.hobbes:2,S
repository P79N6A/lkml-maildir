I don't think he ever implied that. He was only suggesting that when you 
post benchmarks, and even more when you make claims based on benchmarks, 
you need to be extra carefull about what you measure. Otherwise the 
external view that you give to others does not look good.
Kevent can be really faster than epoll, but if you post broken benchmarks 
(that can be, unrealiable HTTP loaders, broken server implemenations, 
etc..) and make claims based on that, the only effect that you have is to 
lose your point.
