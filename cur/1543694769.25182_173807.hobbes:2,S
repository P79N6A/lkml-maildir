radeon fb is completely broken. Previously I would get multicoloured
garbled text under the penguin over all characters that were visible
before radeon fb loaded, but this would scroll away. Now i still get the
garbled screen, but every character on the screen has an extra white
pixel on producing a grid effect. The kernel then oppses.
This is with a Radeon Mobility M6 LY.
