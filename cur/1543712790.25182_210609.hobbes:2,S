Well, main problem is that VMware uses SIOCSIFBR and SIOCGIFBR with completely
different semantic than everybody else, and for VMware identical translation
is correct for SIOCSIFBR. SIOCGIFBR (for which identical translation is
not correct) does not appear to be used at all.
I'll fill bugreport with VMware. For existing systems correct solution is:
(1a) Mark SIOCSIFBR as COMPATIBLE_IOCTL.
(1b) No change is needed for SIOCGIFBR.
(2) Your bridge control tools must be 64bit app. As they'll not run when built
    as 32bit app anyway, no big damage is caused here...
