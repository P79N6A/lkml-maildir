Hi,
this is the second and hopefully last release candidate for 2.4.34.
It fixes vulnerability CVE-2006-6106 affecting bluetooth (with
With malformed packets it might be possible to overwrite internal
CMTP and CAPI data structures).
Please build and test this version, especially on non-x86 archs.
I intend to release 2.4.34 within a few days if nobody complains.
Regards,
Willy
