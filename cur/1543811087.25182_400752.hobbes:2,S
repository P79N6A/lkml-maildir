Surely.
But if we want to keep a track of all the files that are opened, read, 
written or deleted (much like filemon; ``Filemon's timestamping feature 
will show you precisely when every open, read, write or delete, happens, 
and its status column tells you the outcome."), we can write a simple 
patch that makes a note of these events on the VFS layer, and then we 
could export this information to userspace, via relayfs. It wouldn't be 
too hard to code a relatively efficient implementation.
