I would like a review of modutils 2.3.20 changes before issuing the new
version.  There are two patch sets, the first is all the non-security
patches for 2.3.20, the second is all the security changes.
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/patch-modutils-2.3.20-1.gz
 (non-security)
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/patch-modutils-2.3.20-2.gz
 (security)
Apply against 2.3.19, in that order.
I have not tested 2.3.20-1 against sparc yet, too busy.
