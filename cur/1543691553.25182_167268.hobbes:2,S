Hi,
  I thought I'd report some problems (and solutions) I had getting
2.4.21 and 2.4.22 up on a Shuttle Motherboard using a VIA chipset.  
1) Ether
  The motherboard has onboard via-rhine ether; this wouldn't work
with the first kernels I tried.  With 2.4.22 it needs the 'noapic'
option to work (2.4.22 wouldn't build for me single processor).
The errors are timeouts on transmit; the same happens on 2.4.21
2) Audio
This was much more of a fight. The standard 2.4.21/22 via82xxx drivers
were very problematic.  For example random hanging apps, buzzing when
an app had sound open but wasn't actually sending stuff, and a complete
failure to have any sound input.
In the end I gave up and got ALSA 0.9.6; which seems to work fine for
generated audio and audio input.
Except for playing CDs - which don't do anything - I suspect that might
be hardware, but am not sure.
lspci and any other debug available on request.
