The sh people have decided to create the list based on the content of the directory.
Therefore you see the SCCS entry, and that's why you need to do a 'bk bet'.
In general you cannot expect the konfig and build system to work 100% if there is
random files missing in the tree. Those files bk can checkout automatically is
more by luck - and no effort has been put into making this a trustworthy way
to do it.
I expect sh to change their defconfig system to the same infrastructure as used
by ppc, arm and others.
