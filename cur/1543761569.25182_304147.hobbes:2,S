great! The change in question is most likely the copy_page_range() fix
that Hugh resurrected:
ChangeSet 1.2037, 2005/03/08 09:26:46-08:00, hugh@veritas.com
	[PATCH] copy_pte_range latency fix
	Ingo's patch to reduce scheduling latencies, by checking for lockbreak in
	copy_page_range, was in the -VP and -mm patchsets some months ago; but got
	preempted by the 4level rework, and not reinstated since. Restore it now
	in copy_pte_range - which mercifully makes it easier.
are the ext3 related latencies are gone as well - or are you working it
around by not using data=ordered?
