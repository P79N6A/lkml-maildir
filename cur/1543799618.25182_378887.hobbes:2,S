Subject: [PATCH] - Fix memory ordering problem in wake_futex()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here is a fix for a ugly race condition that occurs in wake_futex() on IA64.
On IA64, locks are released using a "st.rel" instruction. This ensures that
preceding "stores" are visible before the lock is released but does NOT prevent
a "store" that follows the "st.rel" from becoming visible before the "st.rel".
The result is that the task that owns the futex_q continues prematurely. 
The failure I saw is the task that owned the futex_q resumed prematurely and
was context-switch off of the cpu. The task's switch_stack occupied the same
space of the futex_q. The store to q->lock_ptr overwrote the ar.bspstore in the
switch_stack. When the task resumed, it ran with a corrupted ar.bspstore.
Things went downhill from there.
Without the fix, the application fails roughly every 10 minutes. With
the fix, it ran 16 hours without a failure.
----
Fix a memory ordering problem that occurs on IA64. The "store" to q->lock_ptr
in wake_futex() can become visible before wake_up_all() clears the lock in the
futex_q.
