Some filesystems are not hardened against mounting a corrupted image and
can Oops. This is also a problem for automounting USB sticks except that
in that case you're (probably) sitting next to the hardware so there
are other ways to do bad things.
From a security point of view I'd like to restrict unprivileged mounts
to a configurable list of filesystem types.
