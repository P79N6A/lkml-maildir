Hello all,
I won't be able to test anything before next Tuesday, but I'm with
Jordan on this one. Have a look at the dmsg output I sent you some
time ago (
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/584681
).
This was as plain from Linus' tree as you get it (git bisect, make defconfig, make)
and I see:
BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000000009fc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000e0000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 000000001e7b0000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000001e7b0000 - 000000001e7bffc0 (ACPI data)
 BIOS-e820: 000000001e7bffc0 - 000000001e7c0000 (ACPI NVS)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000040400000 - 0000000040440004 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000f0000000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved) --  
Kind regards
 
       Joerg

I copied in a 2.6.22 kernel to see that it really did work, and it did.
But here's the crazy part - I did a dmesg, and it looks like it
*is* using e820 data, and it looks complete (I see the entire map - 
including the ACPI and reserved blocks way up high).
So apparently it was the 2.6.22 code that was buggy, but reading it,
I don't immediately see how.
