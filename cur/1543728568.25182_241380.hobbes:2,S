Unless they fixed this very recently, the kernels they build for power4
are the 32-bit ones.  Which work fine if you are booting power4 natively
(ie without it running in partition).  As soon as a power4 box is
running in a partition the kernel breaks because the 32-bit one does not
have the hypervisor calls.
I know Tom Gall has been working on Gentoo for ppc64.
