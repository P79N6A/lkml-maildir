FYI. I just migrated to iptables. The code downloaded from the Debian
site did not compile cleanly, but enough worked to make most of the
shared libraries and the iptables executable.
The total time to do everything was slightly under 2 hours.
The errors from the distribution are:
cc -O2 -Wall -Wunused -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.26/include -Iinclude/ -DNETFILTER_VERSION=\"1.2.6a\"  -fPIC -o extensions/libipt_ECN_sh.o -c extensions/libipt_ECN.c

The build command was:
#
#!/bin/sh
#
#make pending-patches KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux-`uname -r`
make -i  KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux-`uname -r`
The pending patches resulted in many rejects but the kernel
was virgin 2.4.26.
