Roman,
You got my point exactly, keep the issue of license to GPL and not muddy
the waters with a license other than GPL as an example.
David's "Creosote Public License" is an example how an author using such a
license could require the enduser to conform to his/her wishes,
regardless.
His "Creosote Public License" adds restrictions not permitted or covered
by the scope of GPL.  So generating examples of how that license empowers
the author to impose extra restrictions and then saying it is equal to GPL
by association is not helping to clear the mudd.
Sorry if I was not clear about the direction of the message.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
