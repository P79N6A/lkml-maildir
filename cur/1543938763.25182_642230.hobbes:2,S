Why? do you mean implementing a grace time when the soft-limit is
exceeded? this could be done in cgroup_nl_throttle() introducing 3 
additional attributes to struct netlimit (i.e. hard_limit,
last_time_exceeded grace_time) and perform something like:
...
	if ((current_rate > hard_limit) ||
	    time_after(jiffies, last_time_exceeded + grace_time))
			schedule_timeout(sleep);

Yes, the integration with iptables (as Paul said), and traffic shaping
rules would be absolutely the right way(tm) in perspective. I was just
proposing a possible simple API to implement the limiting stuff.
