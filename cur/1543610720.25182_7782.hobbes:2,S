BTW, what is the correct recovery strategy, assuming 2.4.15 has not
been rebooted yet?  Installing a fixed kernel is obviously the first
step.  How should one reboot the system to minimize damage?  Use a
normal system shutdown (with the -F parameter to forc fsck on next
boot), or go to single user, "touch /forcefsck", sync, wait a minute,
and switching of power?
