I think this will create issues for Xen. Initially page table setup
was in C but Xen Guests could not modify the page tables. I think Xen
folks implemented a hypercall where they passed all the page table pages
and the control pages and then hypervisor executed the control page(which
in turn setup the page tables). I think that's why page table setup
code is on the control page in assembly.
You might want to go through Xen kexec implementation and dig through
kexec mailing list archive.
CCing Magnus and Horms. They had done the page tables related changes
for Xen.
Thanks
