Oh, yes! You are right. I completely forgot about NFS. Even worse, old,
classical NFS only supports 8 groups. At some NFS version (or as part of
some vendors defacto standard) it was raised a bit. I remember the NFS
problems we got with several (at that time pretty new) AIX servers where
root appeared to be in more than 8 groups which was a pretty new concept
then.
