No.

Please don't do this; it will not compile when I turn on type checking
on pm_message_t. I have this:
/**
 * pci_choose_state - Choose the power state of a PCI device
 * @dev: PCI device to be suspended
 * @state: target sleep state for the whole system. This is the value
 *      that is passed to suspend() function.
 *
 * Returns PCI power state suitable for given device and given system
 * message.
 */
pci_power_t pci_choose_state(struct pci_dev *dev, pm_message_t state)
{
        switch (state.event) {
        case PM_EVENT_ON:
                return PCI_D0;
        case PM_EVENT_FREEZE:
        case PM_EVENT_SUSPEND:
                return PCI_D3hot;
        default:
                printk("They asked me for state %d\n", state.event);
                BUG();
        }
        return PCI_D0;
}

You passed invalid argument; I see no reason why you should paper over
it and risk continuing. This happens during system suspend; it is
quite possible that user will not see your printk when machine powers
off just after that; and remember that it will not be in syslog after
resume.
