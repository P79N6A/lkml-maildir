? it doesnt matter wether it's doubled or not, being on the 'previous' CPU
means it gets an (absolute) goodness boost. A normal task can get through
if it was running on this CPU before too, and will be sent to / scheduled
by another CPU if not.

why? SMP + caching issues are the same no matter what priority the task
has. Priority is mainly a way to control CPU-bound processes. 
(interactive processes will have maximum priority anyway) 
we already kindof penalize lower priority processes with the mechanizm you
want to have removed:

no. the point as i understand it is to have high statical priority tasks
getting scheduled before lowprio tasks, even if the higher priority task
has used up most of it's timeslice. This concept is independent of SMP
issues. We still schedule exactly along priorities though for CPU-bound
processes.
