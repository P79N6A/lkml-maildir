In the /scripts directory of the Linux tree there is a small utility
that can help you grok these oopses. It is called 'ksymoops'.

Suggestion: don't change kernel primitives like this. Instead write your
code as a Netfilter/iptables module. IMHO it's more of the Right
Thing(tm) and will save you a bunch of headaches...

Only 1 rule really - what ever happens, under ANY circumstances, never
ever go chasing after the ship's cat. Remember: "In Kernel space, no one
can hear you scream." :-)
