I'll post the info as a reply to the first mail in this series. I have
fairly recent gcc (4.1.1) and I don't see us dropping support for it in
the next few years.

Well, uninitialized_var() is definitely more greppable than "= 0" which
code all over does all the time :-) Anyway, the point is that the
warnings are bogus anyway (hence maintainers Cc:'ed so that they can
confirm if I arrived at the conclusion correctly) /and/ that
uninitialized_var() stands out sorely, so I don't see bugs getting
"hidden" at all -- in fact I did find two bugs during this process, and
fixed them accordingly.
Thanks,
