At least AMD (PCI-X) and Serverworks bridges are known broken with MSI
They should be both quirked though. Or rather one SVW bridge is quirked
there might be more. AMD 8131 is quirked. AMD 8132 is broken too but 
should not have the capability structure in the first place.
BTW there seems to be a new ACPI FADT bit that says "MSI is broken"
We should probably check that too as a double check.
