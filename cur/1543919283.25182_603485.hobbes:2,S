First, does your TCP/IP test application work okay on
a Linux machine that does not use your new driver?
That's the first thing to test.
Next, is auto-negotiation working correctly in your
driver? If you don't have auto-negotiation, have you
set the Ethernet parameters correctly so that BOTH
the server and the client use either full-duplex, or
half-duplex, without mixing them up?
Next, make sure that you are properly handling
transmit retries (handling all possible errors)
in your driver. The transmitter does not want
to drop packets if there is no room in the
device, only the receiver should drop packets
if there are no buffers. You do not want
the TCP/IP replacement algorithm to request
missing packets because this slows everything
down. Again, in the transmitter section
of your driver, consider data precious.
Cheers,
