I do reads and writes to it every 5 seconds and sometimes more (
mounted on /tmp, /var/run and the like ) and had an uptime of
about a week (I use it in an embedded-like system and we
sometimes change the system image).
There might be a dentry or inode leak, but that doesn't bite me,
because I only create the files I need once and extend or shrink
them.
But I couldn't stress it too much.
Where exactly do you see the leaks?
PS: For reference, I put the diff to 2.4.0 that I use to
   
http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~ioe/dwg-ramfs.patch
   The original patch has _not_ been done by me, but by
   David Gibson, Linuxcare Australia.
PPS: It would be surprising anyway, if I used the right patch all
   the time, while the wrong one was in acX. That's why I didn't
   submit anything ;-)
