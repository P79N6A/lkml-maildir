Hi folks,
Up to kernel version 2.4.12 the Alsa 0.9beta8a version was working
for my needs. Sometimes the startup script claimed that there is
no soundcard (via686a), but after one or two restarts of this 
script the onboard chip was detected.
With 2.4.13 I had no such luck:
{root@bilbo:harri 937} /etc/init.d/alsasound restart
Shutting down sound driver: done

/usr/sbin/alsactl: load_state:1026: No soundcards found...
I get this _every_ time with 2.4.13 . 
Of course I know that this is not the Alsa EMail list. But
maybe you have some ideas which change has broken Alsa
completely and give the Alsa folks a hint.
Many thanx
Harri
