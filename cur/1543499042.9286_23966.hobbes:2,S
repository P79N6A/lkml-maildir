Has anyone else noticed that the -D option to patch-2.5 is
completely broken?  For example, take the following two
files, do a diff -u, then do a patch -D.  The result is bogus.
It would be a nice little feature, if it worked.
---file: old---
AAA
test delete
BBB
CCC
test replace (old)
DDD
---------------
---file: new---
AAA
BBB
test add
CCC
test replace (new)
DDD
---------------
result after patch -D:
AAA
#ifdef XXX
test delete
#endif /* XXX */
BBB
#ifdef XXX
test add
#endif /* XXX */
CCC
#ifdef XXX
test replace (old)
#else
test replace (new)
#endif /* XXX */
DDD
