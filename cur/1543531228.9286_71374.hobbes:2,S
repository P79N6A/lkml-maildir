You didn't prove anything useful, though.

The problem is not the other processes, though! The problem is, your
workload is too high for the system to handle.

No. Overcommit doesn't change anything other than HOW the problem
manifests itself in this case. The problem is your workload.

You had a dozen or so processes doing something very wrong - grabbing
all the system's resources. Without overcommit, other processes would
have died because of your malloc bomb. With it, there was no problem.
Overcommit just PREVENTED a problem on your box.
