It's only a problem for "reserved L_Key" types of things, where the
device is supposed to just use the address given in a work request
without translating it.  No translation means that work requests have
to contain "bus addresses" -- addresses that are what the device would
put on the bus to access memory.  But if a device needs to simulate
DMA in software, then it really needs a kernel virtual address, not a
bus address.  But it's pretty ugly to have to put that knowledge in
every consumer.
