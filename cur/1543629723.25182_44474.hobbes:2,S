It is the end of a release cycle on a stable kernel with huge changes to
the IDE layer, and we have at least one unconfirmed report of problems
with reiserfs+IDE after a crash.
This is not the right time to send in cleanups like this, especially
when they bits as useless as the stuff below.  #1, #2 and #4 look like
valid fixes.  #3 should probably be mixed with the iput deadlock fix
like Oleg did in 2.5, and should wait until after 2.4.19.
