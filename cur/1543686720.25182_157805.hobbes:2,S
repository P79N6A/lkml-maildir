BUG causes an exception, which calls die(), which in turn calls
handle_BUG(), and this indeed does print the first two lines of the
above.  die() goes on to print the 3rd line, but it also goes on
to call show_registers() which should print the registers and
calltrace as well.
Maybe you've found a bug in show_registers() ?
