I noticed recent discussions about the reserved space on ext2
partitions that is emergency space for root to recover from something
filling the disk (or  defragging, depending on who you ask); Could a
similar thing be done with RAM? The kernel holds back a few MB
(configurable of course), then when you get into an OOM situation,
your algorithm comes into effect and is able to tell a process to shut
down and give it access to the emergency RAM incase it needs to
allocate any further resources for config saving, etc.
RAM is cheap and I would prefer to sacrifice a few MB and have apps
exit gracefully in an OOM situation than have the kernel start dumping
processes and losing data all over the place.
Just an idea, I have roughly zero idea how implementable it is (just
incase you were going to roast me for making a dumb, impossible to
implement solution)
