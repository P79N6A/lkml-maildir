You should have both the sbc8548.dts and the sbc8560.dts in your tree.
They have been in there for several weeks now.
I just tested with the above here, and I was just about to hit send on
this extra chunk to fix the second half of the problem.
Note that I didn't lump the tqm8540 in with the other tqm, because the
defconfig tends to indicate it doesn't need 85xx-cpm2;  just 85xx.
Thanks,
Paul.

    wrapper: Add entries for tqm8540 and sbc85xx
    The wrapper script didn't have entries for the TQM8540 board and the
    SBC8548 or SBC8560 boards.  I've assumed that the TQM8540 console is
    8250 based and not CPM based by looking at its defconfig.  There was
    also a trailing * on the TQM8555 entry that I removed too.
