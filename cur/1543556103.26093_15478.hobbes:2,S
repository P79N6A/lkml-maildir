I would much rather actually go back to the original setup, which did
nothing at all if the queue wasn't plugged in the first place.
I think that we should strive for a setup that calls "request_fn" only to
start new IO, and that expects the low-level driver to be able to do the
whole request queue until it is empty. Then we re-start it the next time
around.
