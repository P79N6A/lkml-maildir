Yes, I'm painfully aware of that. gcc is too damn happy to align stuff.

You can actively fight gcc's sadistic alignment tendencies instead:
struct __immediate {
       long var;               /* Identifier variable of the immediate value */
       long immediate;         /*
                                * Pointer to the memory location that holds
                                * the immediate value within the load immediate
                                * instruction.
                                */
       long size;              /* Type size. */
} __attribute__ ((aligned(sizeof(long))));  <================= HERE
Kernel is already using this technique a lot. Try
grep -r '^\} *__attribute__ *.*aligned' .
