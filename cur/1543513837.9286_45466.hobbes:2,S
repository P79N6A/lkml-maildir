I had two boxes, 486/DX2 and K6-2, both had same debian installed.
Compiled kernels on both boxes using 2.95.1, only difference in menuconfig
was the cpu type.
kernel on K6-2 ran fine, kernel on 486 paniced on boot, if I remember
correctly right after the text 'Linux Net 4.0' or so..
When I replaced 2.95.1 with 2.7.2 on 486 box the compiled kernel was ok.
Cheers..
