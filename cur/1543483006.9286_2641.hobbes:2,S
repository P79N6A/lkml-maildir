The size expansion stuff is majorly overdue.  It *has* to be in 2.3.
Here are the types I suggest to change:
	dev_t	32 or 64 bits
	uid_t	32 bits
	gid_t	32 bits
	time_t	64 bits(??)
Switch Linux to use nanosecond based time; old microsecond-based calls
become compatibility wrappers.
A reasonable compact (16 bytes) structure that would handle all
time-based issues could look like this:
struct timespec {
	s64 tv_sec;	/* Seconds, signed 64-bit (UTC) */
	u32 tv_nsec;	/* Nanoseconds, unsigned 32-bit */
	s32 tv_taid;	/* UTC-TAI delta, signed 32-bit */
};
This is small enough that future filesystems probably could use these
kinds of timestamps, if desirable.
