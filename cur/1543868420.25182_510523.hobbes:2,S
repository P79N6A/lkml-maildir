Yes, this is close (I think) to what I suggested, see below,

Yes. And for this problem WORK_STRUCT_NOAUTOREL does help, but not so much.
It can prevent re-scheduling of the same work, but only if work->func() did
not do work_release() yet.

Yes, destroy_nbp() does dev_put(dev). del_nbp() sets dev->br_port = NULL,
port_carrier_check() goes to "done" in that case. So everething looks safe
to me (but again, I do not even know what the "bridge" is :), so we should
only take care about container, nothing more.
I'll try to make a patch for illustration on evening.
Oleg.
