Could have sworn this was already fixed. Change the 2nd occurence to:
        if (!toc->capacity || toc->capacity == 0x1fffff) {
                stat = cdrom_get_last_written(cdi, &last_written);
                if (!stat && last_written) {
                        toc->capacity = last_written;
                        set_capacity(drive->disk, toc->capacity *
sectors_per_frame);
                }
        }
Thanks for tracking this down and reporting.
