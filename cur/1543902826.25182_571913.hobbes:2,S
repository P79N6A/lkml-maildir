Hi,
When a device is in D3 state, is it possible to read from the PCI
config space header ? Or does a D3 state imply that the whole PC
itself is in standby ?
I am trying to relate whether a device that i have, a new device that
i am working upon, starts up in D3 state. whether that could be the
cause of some weirdness.
Thanks,
Manu
