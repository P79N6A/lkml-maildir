I'm not sure I understand the rationale behind this ... perhaps you could
explain it further. We already have mechanisms to bind a process to 
particular CPUs or node's memory. 
To provide exclusivity seems valuable ... ie to stop the default 
allocations using node X's memory, or CPU Y, and potentially even to
migrate existing users off that.
But that'd seem to be a whole lot simpler than this patch ... what else
are we gaining from CPU sets? The patch is massive, so hard to see exactly
what you're doing ... is the point to add back virtualized memory and 
CPU numbering sets specific to each process or group of them, a la 
cpumemsets thing you were posting a year or two ago?
