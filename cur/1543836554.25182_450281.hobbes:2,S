Christoph,
Thanks for thinking about this.  See comments below.

Why shouldn't I put a probe into a module other than at a symbol I can
find with kallsyms?  For example, I'm interested when a particular
module hits an error condition that occurs.  I don't want to probe how
many times the function gets called - just when the error condition
occurs.
With the existing interface, if I use kallsysms to find the value of a
symbol, the module can be unloaded between the time I use kallsyms and
register the kprobe.  The patch I included fixes that race condition by
incrementing the module reference count.

Your example works for a very small number of symbols, but with a large
number it could take a long time to register the kprobes.  Plus, that
would need to be done every time the kprobe was registered.  With my
patch, the symbol lookup can be done once, then all those symbols can be
turned into offsets from the base address of the module.
