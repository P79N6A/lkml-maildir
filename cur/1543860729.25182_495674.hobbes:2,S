The kernel doesn't care if one CPU is in OF land while the others
are doing other stuff -- well you have to make sure the OF won't
try to use a hardware device at the same time as the kernel, true.

I'm a bit concerned about the 100kB or so of data duplication
(on a *quite big* device tree), and the extra code you need
(all changes have to be done to both tree copies).  Maybe
I shouldn't be worried; still, it's obviously not a great
idea to *require* any arch to get and keep a full copy of
the tree -- it's wasteful and unnecessary.
