Thanks for the information. I guess it would be nice to document this 
somewhere (except in code)... At least I could not find any information about 
it beside some patch (Not directed at you, Roland). Any idea where?
Besides, it has one Problem: It is not backwards compatible. Using it on 
earlier Xen Versions yields the normal tls versions (xen 3.1). Isnt the 
userbase of existing xen installations bigger than the one of some point in 
FC5 test releases?
Ugh. Leaning a bit far out of the door with that one considering my knowledge 
about it... Sorry about that.
Greetings,
Andres
