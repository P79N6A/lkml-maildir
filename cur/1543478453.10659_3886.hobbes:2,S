The already legendary linux performance is significantly enhanced. High end
SMP scaling gives good performance on 12 processor machines. Linux 2.2 supports
up to 64 processor systems.

UltraSparc is a trademark of Sparc (I think), Alpha is a trademark of

You should also quote a URL of Linux press contacts - I've got a table of
some vendor contacts, and a web site scan should find others.
