I hope you don't consider this a good argument to force all the other
platforms to throw away their perfectly good low-core code.  Like
Anton, I do not expect any benefits from thread_info for ia64.  In
fact, if anything it's going to slow things down.  And we don't need
it for task coloring either.  We can do that perfectly fine with the
old setup.
