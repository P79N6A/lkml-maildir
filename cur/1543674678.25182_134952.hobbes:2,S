Well this is currently achievable without doing any further work in its
most trivial form by using crypto loop devices.  The idea is to hide the
entire functionality from the users. Nothing that the user is doing should
change.
The model i proposed is designed under two main constraints:
1. User should be oblivious to any changes to the system.
2. We don't want to redesign the linux mm subsystem we just want to become
friends with it. ;)
Cheers,
Ahmed.
