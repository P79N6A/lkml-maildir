Hi, we plan to build an NFS archive of old unix close accounts, and we are 
looking for a compressed filesystem since size is more important than speed 
for us. Our requirements are :
1- this fs must run on hardware raid (DAC960  Mylex AcceleRAID)
2- the archives files will be read-only for users, but we (administrators) 
must be able to add files to the archives...
Any recomendations ?
squashfs doesn't qualify because of 2 ...
what about e2compress ?

I've heard about block layer compression... is it applicable for us ? 
Thanks for your advice...
