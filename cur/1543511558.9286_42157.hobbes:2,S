In my application (it is an "intelligent" A/D converter sending the data to
the PC through RS at 115200) the detection of overrun is really essential.
The user should be at least warned about such event, and if possible, the
baudrate should be lowered (it can be done automatically by the application,
and the break in the data stream may be marked in the recorded data).
The application shall be used in the hospitals, which due to permanent lack
of money use very old hardware - so RS are offen 16450 based (no input
FIFO), IDE controllers use only PIO mode and so on.
I'm pretty sure, that there are more people who experience that problem.
I think that the first proposed solution (marking of overrun in the data
stream, when PARMRK flag is set) does not increase seriously the size of 
driver's code, and should be safe for other applications (the sequence
0xff 0x01 has no meaning when PARMRK flag is used, so can be used for
marking of overrun event).

I agree, but Linux is often used on very old hardware (unusable with other
contemporary OS's) and I have at least one computer, where there was no way
to avoid overruns at 115200 (386/40MHz, 8MB RAM, IDE-PIO). The possibility
of using such old hardware is one of big advatages of Linux (that's why
most distributions still contain mainly binaries compiled for i386).
The information about the overrun in the logfile may be easily overlooked...
