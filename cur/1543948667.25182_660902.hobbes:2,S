Nearly sent of a reply without thinking about this and it sounds like a
good idea initially. But, if we have a large number of autofs file
systems mounted (thousands?), duplicating the information already
present in the autofs file system seems untidy and unnecessary. I
thought of exposing this information in in sysfs, but that would make
the autofs module part of sysfs have many files, and there is the
problem that the same path could have more than one autofs file system
stacked on top of it, so isn't unique.
The other obvious place is in the mount options but that is one of the
reasons that only the device number is exposed their. If we have 5000 -
10000 mounts then scanning /proc/mounts becomes a big problem from a CPU
usage perspective (and is already a big problem for me, which is partly
addressed by the new bits in the implementation here). If I could think
of another way to expose the device number as well I would use it, even
if it was an additional ioctl, to avoid scanning /proc/mounts.

Not sure I agree about the low call frequency.
It's quite normal for smaller sites to have hundreds of entries in maps
and equally common for them to do stupid things like run scripts that
scan the file systems, mounting every mount.
It's not quite the same order of magnitude, but I regularly use the
autofs connectathon suite for testing. It only ends up mounting several
hundred mounts but I can get mounting and expiring happening at the same
time so it's not an unreasonable way to test.

Right, I'll see what I can find on those topics.
My concern is that this will require considerable work in the daemon
which would be fine for version 5.1 but I need to resolve this problem
for the existing 5.0 implementation.

I'm all ears to any feedback from others on this, please.
