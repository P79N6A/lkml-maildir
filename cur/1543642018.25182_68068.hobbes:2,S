When you ar ehandling CD-ROM problems then they can be quite a lot. Not
helped by the fact some ancient CD's seem to like to take a long walk in
the park when told to reset.

Yes but does windows assume it. There are two specs 8)

Resetting the bus is antisocial to say the least. We had lots of hangs
with the old eh handler that went away when the new one didnt keep
resetting the bus. If we do reset the bus then we have to handle "Sorry
can't reset the bus" (we have cards that can't or won't) as well as
being conservative about timings, making sure we don't reset the bus
during the seconds while a device rattles back into online state and so
on.
