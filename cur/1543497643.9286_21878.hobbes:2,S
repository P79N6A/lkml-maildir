Did you increase the max number of file descriptors on the linux box?  Did
you up the number of apaches that can run (their is a hard limit set in
src/include/httpd.h of 256 that needs to be increased), Did you up the
number of servers on apache?  Did you up the number of maximum tasks in
src/include/linux/tasks.h to at least double its default?
