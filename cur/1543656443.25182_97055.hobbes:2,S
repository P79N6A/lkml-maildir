Indeed. Were you merging something like preempt at this stage, I'd be wondering
if you'd broken out the eggnog a little too soon.

You'd likely need an odd number of folks in this cabal^Winner circle
though, or would you just do it and be damned if you got an equal
number of 'aye's and 'nay's ? 8-)
Other than that, it reminds me of the way the gcc folks work, with a
number of people reviewing patches before acceptance [not that this
doesn't happen on l-k already], and at least 1 approval from someone
prepared to approve submissions.
The approval process does seem to be quite a lot of work though.
I think it was rth last year at OLS who told me that at that time
he'd been doing more approving of other peoples stuff than coding himself.
