I am running the kgdb_2.6.23 branch of your kgdb git tree
(git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jwessel/linux-2.6-kgdb.git).
my kgdb parameter is "6443@10.0.0.28/,32323@10.0.0.11/",
where 10.0.0.28 is my target and 10.0.0.11 is the host running gdb.
I have to sniff gdb in order to find out the value of 32323...

I don't know about 2.6.21, but now it seems that NETPOLL do not
ignore the source port.

Oh that would be great.

I didn't find source forge patches that are still applicable to nowadays
kernels, so I am using your git tree.
