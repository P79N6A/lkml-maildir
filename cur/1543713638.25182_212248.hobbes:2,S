Does anybody know when support for newer devices (Mobile DiskOnChip)
might be available?  Most (all?) of the above devices are not recommended
for new designs.
m-sys has a patch for <=2.4 series kernels, but not for 2.6.  Are those
patches now part of the kernel or are they different implementations
(presumably with different licensing)?  Do the m-sys patches support
newer devices (just not newer kernels)?
Thanks:
                 David
