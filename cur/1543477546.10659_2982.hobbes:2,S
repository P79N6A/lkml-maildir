Hello,
with recent kernels I have one problem. Sometimes I get lots of the
following message in my logfile:
Jan 14 01:03:28 planetzork kernel: Cannot read proc file system: 9 - Bad file descriptor.
Jan 14 01:03:58 planetzork last message repeated 95207 times
Jan 14 01:04:59 planetzork last message repeated 182061 times
On the console there are plenty messages like this:
HiSax: status overflow readstat 8192/4096
Karsten Keil (author of HiSax driver) says that these messages appear
if an overflow of the ringbuffer for messages in /dev/isdnctrl happened.
When this happens the system is nearly unusable because klogd and
syslogd are taking all cpu time they can get.
My system is a dual P133 with 128M + aic7xxx + latest isdn-cvs.
Based on RedHat-5.1 + updates.
If I can help to track this down please let me know.
Regards,
   Jogi
