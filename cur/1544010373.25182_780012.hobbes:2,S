Yes - non-aligned 64-bit arguments in registers really really really
sucks.  On ARM, we will change the syscall argument ordering to avoid
having additional compatibility implementations for EABI vs OABI.
The same goes for similar ABIs with restrictions on 64-bit arguments.
There are causes were a syscall just can not be used on such ABIs.  Eg,
	int a1, unsigned long long a2, int a3, unsigned long long a4
is an impossible syscall argument order for ARM - we run out of registers
for the upper word of 'a4'.
