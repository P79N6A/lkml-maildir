Hi,
I solved the SCSI problem now - thanks for the hint to take 
sym53c8xx instead of ncr53c8xx.
For the SMP-Problem it helped to use an option offerd at boot time:
"Press F9 to select different operating system". Before I used 
"Minimum Configuration...", because Linux wasn't listed.
After I've choosen UNIX/SCO, the SMP was detected properly.
Now I have 3 of these machines, dedicated to a cluster.
On the second machine, The "F9"-option is not offered! 
(only F10 for Partitioning Utilities - but they were not found).
What option do I have now to change the settings? Is there a
posibility to start something from "SmartStart" to adjust it?
I've installed RedHat7 default for servers - there is no special 
COMPAQ-Partition on it (I'm not sure if there was before).
Thx,
Frank
