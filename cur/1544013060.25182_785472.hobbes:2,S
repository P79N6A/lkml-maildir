Does this mean lib/swiotlb.c is broken now?  It has eg:
	void * __weak swiotlb_alloc_boot(size_t size, unsigned long nslabs)
and then
	void __init
	swiotlb_init_with_default_size(size_t default_size)
	{
...
		io_tlb_start = swiotlb_alloc_boot(bytes, io_tlb_nslabs);
later on in the same file.
(I just notice this because I saw the warning about swiotlb_alloc_boot()
not being __init but calling __alloc_bootmem_low and so I looked at the
code yesterday)
