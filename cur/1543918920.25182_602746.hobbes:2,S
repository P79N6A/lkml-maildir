Jan's code is here today and it works fine for me. How can you 
coherently argue against the plain fact that his feature solves my 
usecases perfectly fine, while your hypothetical solution clearly does 
not solve them? (Although i'm not too hopeful you'll give me a straight 
answer to my straight question, given your track record on lkml. It is 
almost as if you were more interested in ranting and in controversy than 
in the progress of Linux.)
