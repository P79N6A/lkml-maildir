Subject: 2.6.2-rc1-mm3: SCSI TARGET RESET on boot with no indication   of why

With my AIC7XXX controller and my rather old Microtek ScanMaker E6
SCSI scanner, 2.6.2-rc1-mm3 for some reason feels compelled to attempt
to reset the scanner immediately after identifying it during the boot
sequence.  When I see "immediately" I mean that there doesn't seem to
be any delay between when it prints out the "Attached scsi generic"
message in the transcript below and when it prints out the subsequent
messages about the TARGET RESET message.
Despite these messages, the scanner appears to work when booting is
finished.
This does not occur with 2.4.22-ac4.
My question is -- do these messages indicate that something is wrong,
what could it be, and what should I do about it?
I tried to find a maintainer for the AIC7XXX code to contact about
this, but I didn't see one in MAINTAINERS.
Thanks,
  jik
