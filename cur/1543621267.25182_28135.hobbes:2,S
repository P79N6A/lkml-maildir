What I do to it next depends on the feedback I get back.

Ask Linus, he asked for the task_struct/thread_info split. Various people have
complained about the two things being allocated separately (maintainers for
m68k and ia64 archs certainly, and if I remember rightly, x86_64 as well,
though I don't appear to have saved the message for that). However, DaveM
(sparc64) appears to really be in favour of it.
In any case, this is just a corollary to my main aim of getting task ornaments
included in the kernel. The userspace resumption notification was the true
prerequisite, to support which I adjusted entry.S to make sure it didn't cost
any extra clock cycles. This led to Linus requesting that everything that
entry.S needs to access be separated out into another structure (so that
entry.S never accesses task_struct).
