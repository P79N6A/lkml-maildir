Sorry I didn't get that (you were a bit terse). 
You're saying the EFI BIOSes will never set that flag ?
I'm reading page 123+ of UEFI 2.1 which describes GetMemoryMap() 
and these flags and I see nothing to that effect. I admit I didn't
read the full EFI bible so far so there are certainly EFI
aspects I don't understand.
Can you please clarify why EFI would not set that flag on Linux? 
Can you refer me to the parts of the spec that describe that?

On 32bit it is wrong too I think at least on non default __PAGE_OFFSET
splits.

Of course it is affected. set_memory_uc() will not fix up the 
direct mapping in this case either. Given the overlap of PCI hole
to direct mapping cases there are more seldom, but certainly
exist (e.g. consider 1:3 split and a 2GB PCI hole) 
And while given that's a relatively obscure case it's a valid regression.
