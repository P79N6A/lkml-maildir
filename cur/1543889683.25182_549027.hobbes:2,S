Yes sure. This is a problem in the NTFS layer. It writes 2 bytes
after the allocated size.

The kzalloc does not increase the size. So I suspect that the bug
did not trigger again after the change.

Is this ntfs_init_locked_inode?

First two bytes after the object overwritten. The allocation for this 
object should have been two bytes longer.

This is the function that allocated a too short object.
