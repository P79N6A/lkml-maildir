They can't modify the license that you used. They can make a new license
which you may optionally use at your discretion.
Once you release the code under the GPL(x), that is it. The only person
who can change that is you or perhaps some bizarre court order. But it
would still be you changing it, even if your hand was forced to do so.
Your copyright is your signing mechanism. Once you do it, its a done
deed. That is the whole reason Linus chose GPL2 to begin with, I
believe :)
You and _only_ you are the one. Its like a biometric lock.
Best,
