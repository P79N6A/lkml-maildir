Note that if you're using a raw device backup strategy (ie "e2dump" or
similar), that is expected: 2.4.x up until about 2.4.7 gave _much_ too
much preference to the buffer cache. 
That should actually have been fixed in 2.4.8. We used to mark buffer
pages much too active.

You just hid the problem - by disabling swap the buffer cache couldn't
grow without bounds any more, and the proper buffer cache shrinking
couldn't happen.
Try 2.4.8 or later.

Tuning for bugs?
What do you want to happen? You want to have an interface like
	echo 0 > /proc/bugs/mm
that makes mm bugs go away?
