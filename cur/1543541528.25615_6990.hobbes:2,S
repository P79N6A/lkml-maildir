Bzzzzzt!  Wrong!  Thank you for playing.
Many bazaar projects have inner and outer circles.  In fact, this
two-tier organization is more typical than not -- when I created
`friends' and `announce' lists for fetchmail I was following widely
established practice.  This simply reflects a natural gradient of
interest and competence and commitment.
It's also the case that the peer-review effect at the heart of Linux's
success uses the brains and eyeballs of the *entire* developer population,
regardless of what concentric circles or cliques they self-organize into.
It's wrong on the facts to say that Linux kernel development is being
done "in a closed fashion" or that lkml is only for community building.
Real design debates do take place there.  Anybody can originate and send a
patch.  And anybody, by displaying sufficient ability and commitment,
can work his or her way into the informal inner circle.
Anybody who thinks this is "closed" has clearly taken too many drugs to 
remember what really closed development is like.

If gun laws in fact worked, the sponsors of this type of legislation
should have no difficulty drawing upon long lists of examples of
criminal acts reduced by such legislation. That they cannot do so
after a century and a half of trying -- that they must sweep under the
rug the southern attempts at gun control in the 1870-1910 period, the
northeastern attempts in the 1920-1939 period, the attempts at both
Federal and State levels in 1965-1976 -- establishes the repeated,
complete and inevitable failure of gun laws to control serious crime.
