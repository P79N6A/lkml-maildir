| losetup from util-linux 2.12 should work.
Hum, I tried that which I built on July 29, that might have been a pre
or something (I'm looking at the mod date on the directory). I'll check
and see what I find, thanks for input.
Actually, I think that version was built under 2.6.0-test4 (or so),
perhaps I have to rebuild under 2.4 and have separate 2.4 and 2.6
versions? Anyway, I'll look more since it should work.
