Alan,
Without this, in 2.4.22-pre10-ac1, ide_ata66_check() in ide-iops.c
returns 1. This causes, for example, that hdparm -i shows only udma
modes 0 to 2 (although the drive has been set to udma6) and refuses to
set any value above udma2 with an ugly "Speed warnings UDMA 3/4/5 is
not functional".
I do not understand the ide subsystem enough (I should say "at all"),
but maybe there are other implications...
Eduardo.
