Ok,
    Here is what I got from my check. Snort is the culprit. When it starts,
it runs at 40mb. Each hour it adds 20 mb. So by the time the system is up
for hours, it starts cosuming memory. Today after I restartd my system, I
noticed every hour it was adding a mb of RAM.
It started at 40mb and after 4 hours is up to 45mb.
Thanx all for your help and assistance.
