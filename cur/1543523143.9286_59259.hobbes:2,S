This discussion is rapidly degenerating into a "does too!" "does not!"
match.  So let me turn the question around.  Assume, for a moment, that a
patch for Linux existed which did two things:
1) Ran signifigantly faster for large run queues- for example it switched
from the current O(n) algorithm to an O(log n) algorithm.
2) Ran slower than the current scheduling algorithm for short run
queues.
And the patch had no other effects on the kernel at large and was
otherwise well written, etc.
Am I right in assuming that wether the patch would be accepted would
depend upon how much slower it made the common case?   Obviously, if it
made the common case no slower, no one would mind putting it in the
kernel.  On the other hand, if it made the common case a million times
slower, there is no way it'd ever get into the kernel, and rightfully so.
Where (roughly) inbetween is the breakpoint?
