Well actually it is not that rare at least for me. Every 3 or 4 days I run
into it (It happened again this morning). The machine has 128 Megs of ram
and 256 Megs of swap. It is my desktop machine and I keep 3 or 4 netscape
windows running all of the time. Well I try to at least. Every 3 or 4 days
the OOM Killer kills netscape, it happened this morning. If I could fix it
I would but alas I do not have the knowledge. The best I can do is test. :(
This is NOT a complaint I just bring this up as another data point.
It used to lock the machine so things are getting better. fwiw, I am
currently running 2.4.2-ac18. The old ac kernels (do not remember exactly
which ones but it was single digits) would allow the machine to start
thrashing. I could usually see that it was running out of memory and if I
was fast enough could kill Netscape b4 the machine locked. If I was not
fast enough it would lock hard. Nothing in the logs.
HTH,
