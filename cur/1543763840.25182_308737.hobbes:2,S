I already tried my own version of the patch with a few printk. I can 
tell you that both probe functions in (ac97_codec.c:719) would report 
the device as modem.
/* Check for an AC97 1.0 soft modem (ID1) */
codec->codec_read(codec, AC97_RESET) returned 0xd3a 
...
/* Check for an AC97 2.x soft modem */ ...
codec->codec_read(codec, AC97_EXTENDED_MODEM_ID) returned 0x1
After that, i mentally applied your patch and appreciated no differences 
in behaviour.
