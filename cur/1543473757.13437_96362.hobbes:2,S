  Tested that out.  I had a 2GB ext2fs parition that I turned into a
swap partition and used it.  Nicely done with a `mkswap -c'.  Even though
the kernel `make -j' seemed to correctly run out of memory, I'll probably
beat that horse again.
  My cursory look of the swap memory-management didn't make it look
like the one "offset exceeds max" error should have been worth a
screeching halt.  With all the failings, you would think that something
else would have randomly failed or otherwise been corrupted.
