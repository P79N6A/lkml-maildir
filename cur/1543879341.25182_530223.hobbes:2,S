Confirmed. 2.6.21-rc6-mm1 with
CONFIG_IPMI_SI=y
hangs upon boot on the already mentioned printk from ipmi_si. With
CONFIG_IPMI_SI=m
the boot succeeds. When manually trying to modprobe ipmi_si after that, 
the modprobe itself hangs, but the machine remains usable otherwise.
I still wonder if this could be related to what Helge was originally 
reporting.
