i agree. What i did was i looked at the kernel-source as-is, and there was
no mechanism to do this properly so i took a different approach. Could
anyone send me per-CPU keventd patches? The thread-exit path is pretty
timing-critical, the current global keventd spinlock does not work.

this function is called under a spinlock currently, so there's no point in
doing that.

hm, i thought it was only under the write lock. Oh, i see, a rare strace
codepath does it. Fixed - thanks.

right - fixed :)

well, yes - but i dislike deferred freeing lists, it's always a problem
where to free the RAM for real. It didnt really work for bhs, it didnt
really work for other items either. And we have this nice lazy-TLB
mechanism for kernel threads so it's really a non-issue to use them.
