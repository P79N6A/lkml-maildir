Could you explain why you think it would be a violation to use POSIX 
types instead of defining our own? That's what the types are for, to 
avoid having everyone define some slightly conflicting types.
The kernel predates C99, sort of, and it would be a massive but valuable 
  task to figure out where a type is really, for instance, 32 bits 
rather than "size of default int" in length, etc, and use POSIX types 
where they are correct. Fewer things to maintain, and would make it 
clear when something is 32 bits by default and when it really must be 32 
bits.
