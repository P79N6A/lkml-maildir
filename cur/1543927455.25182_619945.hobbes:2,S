are you sure? The last -ck patch i can find is for .22:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/ck/patches/2.6/
or have they been forward ported? (if yes, do you have an URL for that)
(my guess is you used the 2.6.23.1 scheduler (CFS), so the improvement 
you felt on the laptop is relative to 2.6.23-vanilla in essence - which 
is good news.)

hm:
The latest stable version of the Linux kernel is:           2.6.23.8
so there's no 23.9 yet.
