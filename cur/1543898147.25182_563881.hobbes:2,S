We need something like this, but I don't quite like the way you've done
it.  First the name is wrong, it's not a nameidata anymore but a lookup
intent, so it should be named that way, struct lookup_intent.  Second
the macro hackery is more than ugly,  please keep the structures separate.
With modern gcc it might be possible to embed the lookup_intent into
the nameidata anonymously.  Also please either remove the dentry from
struct lookup_entry or from the direct argument list of the functions
and methods - there is no need to pass this one twice.
