I was under the impression you didn't change the N value (array size)
and ran the benchmark with someone else's precompiled binaries (the ones
you sent me).  Did you have two binaries with different array sizes
compiled in, or did I miss some way of configuring that?  The
documentation was admittedly sparse.

I ran it on 2.6.5, 2.6.5-mm5, and 2.6.5-mm5-flat-domains trying to
reproduce the results you found (including the poor performance of
virgin and mm) so that I can have some context while analyzing the
sched_domains topology on x86_64 and its effects on performance.  So
that I can see where the differences lie in our tests, could you please
provide some of the specs of the system you ran on, such as number of
procs, cache size, and amount of RAM.
Thanks,
