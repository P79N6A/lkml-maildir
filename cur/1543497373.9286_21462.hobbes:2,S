No.  The code I've seen is bad, at least the patches I've seen.  The real
mode asm code should'nt switch to graphics mode unless it is really sure
vesafb can handle it.  Otherwise you might end up with a non-working
console, which is'nt acceptable.
The S3 vesafb hacks are a nice way to bootstrap a real S3 driver, but
nothing more IMHO.  I really don't like the idea to add hardware-specific
hooks to vesafb.

If vesafb scans the PCI space for the board which holds the framebuffer
address it has, it can figure out the correct PCI card without much
trouble.  But figure out which of the memory regions the mmio area is is
impossible without hardware-specific code (which I don't want to see in
vesafb). For locking this might not be needed, you can simply lock down
all memory regions you'll find.  But I'd use some pci device locking
instead of adding {check,request,release}_mmio.
