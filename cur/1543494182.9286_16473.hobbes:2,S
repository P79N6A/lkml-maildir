	As I said, before: TCP, as originally specified, does not
directly support out-of-band data; it supports "urgent" data (using
its own semantics for "urgent").  If an application has "urgent" data
(matching the TCP semantics), then it shouldn't attempt to translate
it to OOB data (as you suggested above) before sending it via TCP!  If
an application wants out-of-band data, it *must* encode the data
in-band, using an appropriate mechanism (escape sequence, octet count,
flattened structure).  Please read the TELNET Options RFCs for details
on one way to do this (note: if the BSD folk had kept the TELNET
option encoding, but not the negotiation, the world might have been a
happier place).
	A simple way of putting this is that multiplexing "OOB" and
"normal" data in a single stream is simply not a service provided by
TCP (as originally defined).  An application that expects TCP to
provide this service is mistaken.
