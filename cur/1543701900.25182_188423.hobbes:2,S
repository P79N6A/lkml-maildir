Hi folks!!
  Sorry I have been quit for the last few weeks. I just finished moving 
closer to work. I had a two hour commute each way from work for the last 6 
months. Now I live 30 minutes from work. So now I will have more free time 
to work on the framebuffer layer. I have alot of email to cover so be 
patient with me.
