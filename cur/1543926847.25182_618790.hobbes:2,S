Subject: [REQUEST] New boot flag/kernel option

I would like to request a new boot flag/kernel option that would make
the following scenario possible:
1) Working on laptop with a live USB distro on a read-only USB stick.
2) Suspend laptop.
3) Detach USB stick.
4) Do other things, get on a plane, go on a bus, deal with police
officer giving you a ticket for operating a laptop while driving...
5) Attach the same read-only USB stick.
6) Resume laptop.
7) Continue work as if nothing happened.
The last time we were able to do something like this was in 2.6.21.
If not, could you please advise a workaround to get this functionality
with the latest kernels.
Thank you very much,
Raymano
