Typically, yes. But what I am trying to discuss is a kernel model
improvement. Such a project, when taken to the point where it works well,
will be very hard, if possible at all, to integrate into the base. If it
wasn't so,I would be the happiest man around, being able to test all
doubts in practice, without meddling in other people's work.

Not true. I would be doing that if I was thoroughly convinced that the
layered model is good, and that it is exactly the kernel model needed.
Currenly, it seems to me a good idea. That is why, after some months of
gnawing at it, I dared to post here. However, I have also seen a lot of
"great" ideas that are actually bad - and am afraid that this may turn one
of these. My judgement is not subscribed for the eternal truth, after all.
Currently we talk not already coding, but still designing. And what I am
asking for is people to add to _my_ list to work on. If they would like to
contribute some design work, that will be nice, but a simple "It is weak
here, see to improve it" will be already excellent help.

Wait, wait a bit :-) I am still trying to see if that attractively looking
model is really good. After (rather, _if_) it is proven good, I would be
asking for implementation suggestions. But let's see first if it is worth
implementing.
As for directions and adding code: Nobody ever, AFAIK, has intentionally
pushed the kernel towards this layered model. And the kernel source is
already structured in a way convenient to go with it, and for the last
three years was going exactly in this direction! That is why it seems
to me that this is the internal logic of the kernel development.
