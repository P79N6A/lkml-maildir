Everything would break.  Remember that lots of programs use terminal
control ioctls.
So far I've seen two design ideas.  One is an new 'nioctl' system call
which takes 'len' as a fourth parameter.  The other is to add
'ioctl_register' and 'ioctl_unregister' to the kernel, so that the
kernel knows this information and can export it, even though the
information is not present in the API.
