It's really a bit of (subjective) cleanup, that just incidentally
happens to save us a few extra clock cycles here and there. In the
current code, the "count" and "pt" variables are modified both in the
function where they're declared (do_poll()), AND also indirectly in a
different function (do_pollfd()). The patch moves all handling of these
variables to the function that declares and "owns" them (do_poll()).

I couldn't agree more on this particular point. The only thing that
stops me is that noone can ever agree on the coding style, even if it is
spelled out in the Documentation/ directory (witness the periodic flame
wars on this list). Helps to have a thick skin, and I'm slowly getting
to that point. ;)
I'll correct, comment, and resend the patch when I get a chance.
