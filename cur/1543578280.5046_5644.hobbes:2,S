No, because to open a directory you only nead read permission, whereas
to read attributes of files in the directory, you need execute
permission on the directory.
Also, you are getting notifications for unlinked files, which perhaps
you should not be able to know anything about.  (If the directory wasn't
accessible when the file was unlinked for example, but was made
accessible later).
