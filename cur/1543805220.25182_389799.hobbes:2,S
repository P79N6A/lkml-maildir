**sigh**
Matthias Andree said "(Joerg, please don't talk about layer
violations here)", yet you do.
We Linux users will forever patch your software to work the
way every Linux app is supposed to work. (well, assuming
nobody succumbs to a well-caffeinated urge to fork the code)
Really, "users of cdrecord like to run cdrecord -scanbus"???
They LIKE running a command to generate phony SCSI addresses?
That's news to me.
To better protect users from terrible accidents, Linux should
avoid assigning a /dev/sg* device for anything with a regular
device file. This, along with elimination of the obsolete
ide-scsi crud, would make things a lot more safe and sane.
BTW, before Joerg mentions portability, I'd like to remind
everyone that all modern OSes support the use of normal device
names for SCSI. The most awkward is FreeBSD, where you have
to do a syscall or two to translate the name to Joerg's very
non-hotplug non-iSCSI way of thinking. Windows, MacOS X, and
even Solaris all manage to handle device names just fine. In
numerous cases, not just Linux, cdrecord is inventing crap out
of thin air to satisfy a pre-hotplug worldview.
