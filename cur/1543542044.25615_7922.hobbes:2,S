Wrong.

True.
Still, for uuencoding, there are far too many implementations of
uuencode around (with/out checksum, with/out boundary, using blanks
(0x20) or backticks (0x60)), and finally, uuencode is trashed when
quoted-printable encoded.
These considerations are overcome by MIME which is well-defined. Wrong
implementations of a well-defined standard may not be excused, flaky
implementations of a not-so-well "standard" are to be avoided.
Note that particularly, 8 years after RFC 1521/1522 (which have not
really changed in 2045..2049), there is absolutely no excuse for a lack
of MIME support.
