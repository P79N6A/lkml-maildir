That's exactly what Martin Hick's additions to __alloc_pages() were trying to 
achieve.   However, we've never figured out how to make the "very low 
overhead light try to free pages" thing work with low enough overhead that it 
can be left on all of the time.    As soon as we make this the least bit more 
expensive, then this hurts those workloads (file servers being one example) 
who don't care about local, but who need the fastest possible allocations. 
This problem is often a showstopper on larger NUMA systems, at least for HPC 
type applications, where the inability to guarantee local storage allocation 
when it is requested can make the application run significantly slower.
