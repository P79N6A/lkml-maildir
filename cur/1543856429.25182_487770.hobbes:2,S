I have no influence over the distributions' choice of kernel compiler
options. The fact is, though, that few of them support nfsroot out of
the box. AFAICS FC-6 is one of those that appears not to.

Most people that run nfsroot systems do so because that makes
provisioning of new machines easy: if you only have one system image,
then upgrading it is less of a challenge.
