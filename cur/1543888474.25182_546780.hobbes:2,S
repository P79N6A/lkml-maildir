Hi,
I am of course not a fan of limiting the maximum of available loops to 8.
My question / proposal for now would be:
Could anybody of you please be kind enough and write / provide me a counter 
patch supplying me:
a. a compilable 2.6.22-rc2 kernel
b. a loop device that can mount up to 8 iso-images
I would prefer this thing as outline attachment due to Email client 
wordwrapping problems.
Looking happily forward to a functionable counter patch to resolve the current 
issue as a compromise solution,
Best regards and thanks
Uwe
