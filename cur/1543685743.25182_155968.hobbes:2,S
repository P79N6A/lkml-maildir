I had thought that the need for writing NULL where a pointer is
expected in varags functions was because the machine may have
different sizes for pointers and int.  In the case of the second
printf call above, if pointers are 64-bit and integers are 32-bit,
printf will read eight bytes from the stack, and only four will have
been occupied by the integer 0.
