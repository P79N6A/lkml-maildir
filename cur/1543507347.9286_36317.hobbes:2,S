However, NT 4.0 I believe use no-emulation mode, so that one you would
expect to work.
By the way, the El Torito spec is available on Phoenix' web site
(www.phoenix.com) together with a whole slew of other useful specs.
I'm planning to have no-emulation support in by new boot loader
(preliminary name "lbcon"); it will have access to the CD filesystem
itself.  Currently, mkisofs doesn't support no-emulation mode; that of
course needs to be added.
