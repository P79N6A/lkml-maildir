I think they were internal patches from Carl-Daniel. I think one of them 
was for wol support, the other one a bugfix.

At least
- wol support
- ethtool support

Ok.

It's probably stale, I must check my docs. I'll remove it after some 
more testing.

Ok, I'll fix that.

The driver doesn't support ethtool, so this was not tested.
I have tested it with a cross-over cable to a natsemi nic and then 
forced link speeds on the natsemi nic with ethtool.

Ups. You are right. I'll fix it and send you an updated patch.

I agree - dprintk on is too verbose and dprintk off is too quiet. I'll 
fix it in another patch.

I'll add that.

Not really: the only use is
ring_flags = cpu_to_le32( (skb->len-1) | tx_flags);
Pre-swapping it would change that to
ring_flags = cpu_to_le32(skb->len-1) | np->tx_flags;

A phy with id 0 is in isolate mode. It must be reconfigured before it 
can be used, and this is not yet handled.
