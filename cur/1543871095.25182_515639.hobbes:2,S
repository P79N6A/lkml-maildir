Hi Howard
I think you should address these questions on netdev instead of linux-kernel.

I dont uderstand... doesnt slapd server listen for connections on a given 
port, like http ? Or is it doing connections like a ftp server ?
Of course, if you want to open more than 60.000 concurrent connections, using 
127.0.0.1 address, you might have a problem...

Well, is it really a MSL problem ?
I did a small test (linux-2.6.21-rc1) and was able to get 1.000.000 
connections on localhost on my dual proc machine in one minute, without an 
error.
