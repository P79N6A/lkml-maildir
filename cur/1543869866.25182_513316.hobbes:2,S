Thanks for posting this.
I was wonding if it would be better to have the ->enqueue() perform
the mapping operation, store the queue index selected inside of the
skb, and just use the normal ->hard_start_xmit() to send the packet
out?
The only thing to take care of is the per-queue locking, but that
should be easily doable.
We might be able to do this even without making sk_buff any larger.
For example, I suppose skb->priority might be deducable down to
a u16.  After a quick audit I really cannot see any legitimate use
of anything larger than 16-bit values, but a more thorough audit
would be necessary to validate this.
