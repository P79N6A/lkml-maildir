Definitely, and we need to figure out why the patch cause a regression.
Those patches fixes a serious issues with a number of machines.
The problem is very nasty as all the various parties involved (radeonfb,
X radeon driver, radeon DRM, etc...) all try to reconfigure the card
memory map in differently bogus ways...
Can you add printk's to the kernel to check the values in
CONFIG_MEMSIZE, CONFIG_APER_SIZE, priv->fb_location and the values
calculated for gart_vm_start ? Then tell me what that printk gets on X
start and when switching consoles.
Thanks,
Ben.
