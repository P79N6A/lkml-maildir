I wrote a couple of days ago, about my trouble getting nls to work. 
(virgin 2.2.1) It seems that if the kernel is compiled, to just support
base filesystems, then booted, make menuconfig to add NLS/vfat/...,
followed by make modules/modules_install, then nls won't work.
If the modules are selected at kernel compile time then it does.
Is this a problem with my understanding, or the source?
