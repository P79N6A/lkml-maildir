Sure, boot a recent linux kernel (2.0.34 or later I believe) or
any 2.2 kernel, and then do:
1 root@red:/# cat proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
cpu             : 586
model           : AMD-K6tm w/ multimedia extensions
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
stepping        : C
fdiv_bug        : no
hlt_bug         : no
f00f_bug        : no
fpu             : yes
fpu_exception   : yes
cpuid           : yes
wp              : yes
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr mce cx8 10 mmx
bogomips        : 399.77
As you can see, no f00f here.
