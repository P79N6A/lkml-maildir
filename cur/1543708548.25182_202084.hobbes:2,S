This information can be determined from the SleepAVG: field in the 
/proc/<pid>/status and /proc/<tgid>/task/<pid>/status files by 
subtracting the value there from 100.  Without our patch this value is a 
directly calculated estimated of the task's sleep rate which is 
available because it used by the O(1) scheduler's heuristics.  With our 
patches, it is calculated from our estimate of the task's usage because 
we dispensed with the sleep average calculations as they are no longer 
needed.  We decided to still report sleep average in the status file 
because we were reluctant to alter the contents of such files in case we 
broke user space programs.

I think a modification to fs/proc/array.c to make this field a per 
million rather than a percent value would satisfy your needs.  It would 
be a very small change but there would be concerns about breaking 
programs that rely on it being a percentage.
