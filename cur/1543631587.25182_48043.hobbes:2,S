You can solve it by disabling pre-emption (and given its questionable
value doing so permanently might not be a bad idea). However if you simply
disable pre-emption during udelay() calls then you've just screwed yourself
by removing 99% of the use pre-emption had.
Given all the pain its probably better to not use the TSC
