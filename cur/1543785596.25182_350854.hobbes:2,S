Fine ;) it's in -mm too, I hope it's stable and it doesn't introduce
regressions ;).
BTW, I tested dbench (not after a fresh mke2fs so there might be
minor fragmentation variations) and it doesn't seem affected by it (it's
in the noise range) and I take it as a good thing. dbench keeps looking
weird, if you notice the lower bandwidth of 273 completed in 12m13s
while the higher bandwidth of 291 completed in 12m15s... perhaps it
prints the best bandwith of the passes and it's not an average.
