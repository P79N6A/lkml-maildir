I've found a few inconsistencies with the wording of some license
statements refering to "GNU public license" and similar, and have
reworded them properly to "GNU General Public License".
Please apply this to 2.4.0, it's against test9.  I'll do one for
2.2.x too, and look for other such typo/thinko stuff.
