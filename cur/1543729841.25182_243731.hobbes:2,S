Well ... despite the danger, that this email ist just another meaninless
remark, too, I'd say that Sun acts like any other big software company: they
don't listen to single persons reporting bugs, and tend to blame misbehaviour
of software on you. Personal experience: I implemented some smartcard driver,
it didn't work, I identified a bug, reported it. Sun said: "your software is
buggy". It was only after our client (a big company) intervened, that Sun modified
their kernel drivers (allthough I think the error was "below" that).
Even though I exactly told them how to reproduce the bug, they were not able to.
Two co-workes had to go to Sun in San Francisco - and they instantly were able to
reproduce the bug on Sun's machine.
Typical scenario: small sw-company reports bugs -> reply: "you are too unskilled".
                  big company enters the scene -> things are getting fixed.
So, you see, Sun is not per se impeccable.
best regards,
H.Rosmanith
