fd = open("complexfile", O_RDWR);
sfd = sub_open(fd, "subfile", O_RDONLY);
There is a semantically rich user space filesystem/database described in a
compiler demo kit at:
ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/c/oxcc1434.zip
Look for cff.txt in the doc subdirectory.
I've changed it substantially over the last couple of years but
there are plenty of semantics in there, more than you would ever
want to incorporate at the OS level.
