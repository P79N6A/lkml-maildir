Which option do you mean by 'Coprocessor emulation' ?
If you mean the math emulation, it doesn't get used on a machine
with a real FPU, so this doesn't make any sense.
Is your board actually an SMP capable board ?
The choice of thunderbirds in an SMP system is also curious.
Thunderbirds are model 4. The only models certified for use in
SMP are model 6 and above. (See arch/i386/kernel/smpboot line 136 or so)
