Close.
If the irq is disabled we need to bail out instead of skipping the
masking.
The masking is required for the function to run correctly and
when IRQ_DISABLED is set we don't know enough to do anything.
Once this is fixed we just need to fix the msi case where the
hardware doesn't provide a mask bit.
