The shell might not read this all the while so the name you see
may not change until you change directory.

This should not happen and it doesn't happen in kernel version 2.4.0-test0

# pwd
/tmp
# mkdir old
# cd old
# pwd
/tmp/old
# mv ../old ../new
# pwd
/tmp/old       The shell hasn't re-read the current directory
# ls
# >foo		Make a file called foo
# ls
foo		It's there okay
# rm foo	Remove the file 
# mkdir bar	Make a directory
# ls
bar		It's there
# cd bar
# pwd
/tmp/new/bar	Now, the shell re-read the directory, it is correct
# cd ..
# pwd
/tmp/new	Back where we were, shell reads correct directory.
# cd ..
# ls
new  typescript
# rm -r new
# exit
exit
