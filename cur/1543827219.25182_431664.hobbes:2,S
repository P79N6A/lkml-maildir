I was wondering about this. I just want a way to show what are the currently
loaded drivers, so it's a read-only attribute.  It's using snprintf (though
I haven't added a check for possible overflows, should be a 2-liner). Maximum
number of lines is 16, and there are examples of this rule-breakage in the
current sysfs tree.
/sys/class/usb_host/usb_hostx/device/pools
Yes, none are valid excuses.  Anyway, what would be the best way? I was
considering creating another class for vt_console, but that would entail
the creation of a new device major number just for this.

The binding part, maybe none, but that's still debatable.  It's the unbinding
feature that people are requesting.  Note the longish threads on "the future
of graphics subsystem".  It would also ease the life of console driver
developers, and it would stop people from pestering me on why they cannot unload
their beloved framebuffer console and drivers and go back to VGA console.
