What type of heavy workloads have you measured? Including db transaction
processing and decision making workloads?

I found above claims are generally false for workload that puts tons
of pressure on CPU cache, especially with db workload.  Typically
for db workload, the working set in user space is so large that making
a trip into the kernel has far large secondary effect then the primary
cache miss occurred in the kernel.  In other word, cache lines evicted
by the kernel code have far larger impact to the overall application
performance and leads to lower overall lower system performance.  So
when you say "get lost in the general system overhead", did you consider
the secondary effect it does to the application performance?
What we found is going from NR_CPU = 64 to 128, it has small performance
impact to db transaction processing workload.  Though I have not measured
difference between 128 to 1024.
