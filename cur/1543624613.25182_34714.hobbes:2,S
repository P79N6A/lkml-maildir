I can't think of a way your current code is invalid.  It's all
hidden behind an asm.  The compiler could guess the two addresses
are the same iff smp_processor_id() is the constant 0, aka UP.

This definitely needs to be per-architecture.  On Alpha, I think I
can use the Thread Local Storage model to be added to binutils 2.13
(and potentially compiler support to gcc 3.[23]).  IA-64 may be able
to do the same.  It's certain that x86 can't, since the userland
model requires %gs:0 point to the thread base, and the kernel folk
would never cotton to the segment swapping that would be needed.
