How hypocritical that the Linux community fights so hard against the "evils" of corporate greed, while it has no qualms about accepting their NDAs, binary blobs, and non-redistributable drivers.  It will bend over backwards for closed-source vendors, but won't extend the olive branch to Free Software brethren.
Your accusation the Linux community had no problems with "binary blobs 
and non-redistributable drivers" is quite far away from the truth.
