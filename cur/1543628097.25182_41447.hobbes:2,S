This looks fine.

But I'd just omit this last sentence ... that only works for machines 
with a contig mem_map (not NUMA), and it's kind of an accidental
kludge that happens to work in some cases, not the proper definition
(what I originally posted was confusing).
I actually submitted a patch a couple of days ago to fix these to
a pfn instead. If that gets in, we can update the documentation then.
