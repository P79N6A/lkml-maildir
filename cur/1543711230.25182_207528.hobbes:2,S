This is because of work Dave Miller and Ingo did - irq count, softirq
count, and lock count (when PREEMPT=y) are unified into preempt_count. 
So it is intended.
The unification makes things cleaner and simpler, using one value in
place of three and one interface and concept in place of many others. 
It also gives us a single simple thing to check for an overall notion of
"atomicity", which is what makes debugging so nice.
