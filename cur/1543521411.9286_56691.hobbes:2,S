This wouldn't be flexible enough. Many ioctls pass multiple objects around.
For the standard form the existing ioctls encode their size. Also since the
copy*user* stuff does inbuilt fault handling and we need to know the object
size for the copy it has no code size improvement
devicecontrol in the form you give has no value outside a message passing
microkernel.
