So use glimpse and run an indexer once a night to pick up changes.

Ugh, esp since you're not caching any results of all that work either,
when you need to repeat 10 minutes down the line...

I think we want to pull this back a bit more and define this better.
Instead of 'system' we should be thinking 'namespace' or 'hierarchy'.

Is the overhead of pre-indexing all files and their contents worth it
though?  And would the use of inotify allow us to efficiently update
the index in a fairly quick time?
All the various arguements have been that we need a filesystem which
magically indexes files, does queries and does it all atomically and
without any thought on the part of the developer/user.  It could
happen, but then we'd have such a *slow* system in general, just to
make 1% of the usage simpler (for some measure of simple) that it
would be a waste.
Providing a simple, consistent set of semantics and syntax allows you
to build on top of it the layer(s) you need to provide the guarenttees
you need for your application.
I don't expect that Oracle has the same needs as does my mail spool,
or as an image store.  Sure, Oracle could do both of them, but are
the overheads of oracle worth the slowdown in the common case?
