Yes, fixing it correctly looks very hard. Just changing the routes
doesn't seem right to me, someone might have added it with exactly
this prefsrc and doesn't want it to change, its also not clear how
to notify on this. Taking care of correct ordering of the ifa_list
is also more complicated without just deleting and readding them.
I have a patch to do this, but it needs some debugging, for some
unknown reason it crashes sometimes if I remove addresses without
specifying the mask.
