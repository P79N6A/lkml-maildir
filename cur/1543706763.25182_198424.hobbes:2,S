I am running a 2.4.19 Kernel and have a problem where a process is using the
up to the 0xC0000000 of space. It is no longer possible for this process to
get any more memory vi mmap or via shmget. However, when I dump the
/procs/#/maps file, I see large chunks of memory deleted. i.e this should be
freely available to be used by the next call. I do not see these addresses
get re-used. The maps file is attached.
