Nice proposal.  But I have one question:
Where do the current subsystem maintainers fall into this system?
Do people still submit patches to them, and then do the maintainers then
submit them into this system, or do people submit them directly into the
system, and the maintainers pluck them out and approve or deny them?
thanks,
