I think the overhead could be higher.  But even if it is 2 bytes
per block, then for 1M of incompressible input the total overhead is
2 * 1048576 / 65536 = 32
bytes.
Also I'm not certain if it will actually create 64K blocks.  It might
be as low as 16K according to the zlib documentation.

Actually there is a limit on that too but that's not relevant to
this discussion.
