Actually, the best way is to not run so much software.  An yes,
that is an option.  I won't say no to an improved kernel too though. :-)
The apps mentioned are popular, but few needs *all* of them.
One can do without KDE and gnome, run a nice lightweight
window manager instead.  Take the kde/gnome performance hit
only when you actually need some kde/gnome app. Not every day.
A nice windowmanager like icewm of fluxbox brings the login
delay down to 3s or so for me.
Openoffice has lightweight alternatives for every task.
(abiword,lyx,gnumeric, . . . )  Strange that this bloated sw is
as popular as it is, given the many alternatives.  Not something
I use every month, and I use linux exclusively for my office tasks.
Another alternative is to profile the slow apps and improve them.
Fix algorithms, optimize stuff. 
The slow boot is fixable by:
1) run boot scripts in parallell instead of sequentially - somewhat 
experimental
    but helps.  Especially if you can bring up X before slowest stuff 
completes.
2) Don't run what you don't use/need!  Don't install everything and the 
kitchen
    sink just because it is free software.  I am guilty of installing 
too much myself,
    so I suffer 40-second bootup time.  But I don't reboot my office pc 
every
    week, normally I only have that 3s login delay.
