It is, after all, deeply cool, if it can be got to work.

No, but why not get the design right first time?

If it has to be done manually, IMNSHO it is nearly useless. The whole
point of this is that redundancy that you *didn't know was redundant*
can be eliminated. (If you want redundancy for safety, FS replication
and/or RAID are the way to go; not accident.)

Agreed. Versioning is another `must-have' for this fs. We're nicking
ideas from all over the place, a *lot* from reiserfs. We're also, when
we have some code, going to be using the Reiserfs Rule --- also known as
McVoy's Lesson --- `benchmark, benchmark, benchmark!'.

Yeah, basically. Only the compression algorithm is designed on-the-fly
for that data set.
(The maths nutter --- not I --- whose idea most of this was is still
working on it.)

It's too embryonic atm, the design is still thrashing back and
forth. One hopes something more will come of it in time. I'm probably
going to set up a mailing list for it soon; hopefully things will start
taking off.
