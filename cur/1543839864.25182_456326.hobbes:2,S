Not necessarily:
	if (UNW_SP(&info))
		stack = (void *)UNW_SP(&info);
is rather fragile - the minimum extra protection here should be to only use
UNW_SP() for the continuation stack pointer if it actually points into kernel
space (as is being done in one of the 2.6.19 patches), ...

... but of course I continue to agree that doing things like
	addr = *stack++;
in the legacy stack trace code cannot be good, given that this code
generally is expected to run when things are already bad in some way.
