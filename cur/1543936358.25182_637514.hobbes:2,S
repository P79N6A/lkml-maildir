Sorry for the confusion.  The correct patch to apply is 
pm-acquire-device-locks-on-suspend-rev-3 (plus the attending 
style-fixups).  It encompasses those earlier patches.
The real problem is that our current email workflow patterns don't 
provide a standardized way for maintainers to tell when a new patch 
submission is meant to override or replace an earlier submission (or 
even a set of earlier submissions).  Does anybody have some suggestions 
for a good way to do this?
