erm, let me take a peek at what you just chopped out.
Yeah.  Um.  I mention XFS and ext3 *once* in the whole message.  As an
example of filesystems in general, because the only other two I'd
consider (or ever use) for a desktop FS at this point is XFS or ext3.
And it was a hypothetical opinion (I don't really know if / how much
Hans feels that way), and I personally find it far easier to believe
that there are stubborn people or that there isn't enough communication
of facts than that there is actually some anti-reiser conspiracy.
So, my mistake for trying to speak for other people.

I don't, actually.
I did expect the peer review to be a little more efficient, less
confrontational, and (maybe) more fair.  But I'm actually a bit content
right now.  After all, I *am* running reiser4 on two of the three
machines I maintain at home.
And, if you scroll up a bit, at this point I just want this resolved.  I
don't particularly care if Hans decides to just keep maintaining a
patchset, although I would be happier if it got into the mainstream
kernel -- I wouldn't have to wait as long to install each new 2.6.11 or
2.6.12 + nvidia module.
But this is a lot of time and energy from a lot of people on both sides
who I would rather see working on something else.
I appologize for the tone of that, too.  I know you don't work for me...
