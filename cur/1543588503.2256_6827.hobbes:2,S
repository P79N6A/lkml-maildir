Only if it traps on the esc op-code --and if it does, we are in a
world or hurt for performance. There is no other way that the kernel
can 'protect' on a per-process basis since the FPU executes instructions
in "process-owned" address space, and addresses "process-owned" data.
I'll have to check this out. Of course it traps on all such instructions
if we have a '386 (so the FPU can be emulated), but that was never a
performance issue.
