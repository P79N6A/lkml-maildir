Can we please have a single symbol defined and name it:
HAVE_*
Then the architectures that HAVE this feature can select the symbol.
So somewhere in maybe lib/Kconfig or maybe arch/Kconfig add:
config HAVE_UNALIGNED_ACCESS_SUPPORT
	bool
And then for x86 select the symbol:
 config X86
+	select HAVE_UNALIGNED_ACCESS_SUPPORT
This follows the suggestion as available in
Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
