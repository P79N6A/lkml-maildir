I found the leak.  As predicted, it was stupid, a get_page left over from a 
previous incarnation.  Now it's behaving pretty nicely.  I haven't seen an
oops for a while and leaks seem to be down to a dull roar if not entirely 
gone.  I think swapoff isn't entirely comfortable with the new situation, and 
tends to hang, I'll look into that in due course.
Since I don't actually have a user base for this, I just overwrote the 
previously posted leaky version, it's still:
  nl.linux.org/~phillips/ptab-2.4.17-3
This is getting to the point of needing heavier testing.
