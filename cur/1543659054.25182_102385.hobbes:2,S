 I've just started running pre3, and after a few minutes the above
message started to appear. I can see it is coming from
i386/kernel/timer.c, but beyond that I'm out of my depth, so I'll just
report it for my betters.
 I remember that in earlier versions of 2.4 there was a sporadic timer
message, along the lines of "probably via" (?) which also affected this
box. 
 The CPU is a K6-2, on a Jetway 542C mobo. lspci shows an Ali M1541 (rev
04) host bridge and PCI bridge, with an Ali M1533 (rev c3) PCI to ISA
bridge and a M5229 IDE i/f (rev c2). Compiler was gcc-2.95.3.
 Any more information anybody would like ?
Ken
