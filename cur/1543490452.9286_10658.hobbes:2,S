Framebuffer, that is. Try vesafb, or look at 
http://www.ggi-project.org/.

Vesafb is somehow doing this. It is not really usefull to switch between
several video modes, however it seems to fun. This feature actually
exists in FreeBSD. A bit dangerous if your bios is not clean, and
crude, but effective.
You might just want to use dosemu: run dosemu, with granted access to
the video ports, use your favorite vesa bios or msdos-tsr, and go into
the wanted mode. You will need to hack a little the kernel, so that
vesafb understand this operation.
By the way, the dosemu source should be a good documentation for vm86().

Userland stuff. Run the killer daemon with SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO
priority, all pages locked in memory with mlockall(). Use /proc/*/stat*
to detect bad guys, zap them, have no mercy.
