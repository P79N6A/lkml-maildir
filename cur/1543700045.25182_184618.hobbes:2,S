Subject: [PATCH 2.4] Wolfson AC97 touch screen driver - build
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch removes the battery monitor text from the kernel build
configuration. The battery monitor will eventually be a separate driver.
Patch is against 2.4.24-pre1
