It will even be worse because we are accessing memory, and most architectures
will not be able to use a memory reference for both operands of the XOR.
Basically, what will be generated will look like this :
  tmp = *b
  *a ^= tmp
  tmp ^= *a
  *b = tmp
  *a ^= tmp
which is 5 cycles, or 4 if the two last instructions get merged. And there's
3 memory reads + 3 memory writes (assuming that the CPU will be smart enough
to reuse *a without accessing memory at instruction 3).
The move is quite faster :
   tmp1 = *a
   tmp2 = *b
   *a = tmp2
   *b = tmp1
This is 4 cycles on simple CPUs, or even 2 cycles on most of todays CPUs
which can do the first two fetches at once, and the last two writes at once.
And there are only two reads and two writes.
Clearly this one is better.

Willy
