Good!
[Four years ago I submitted a patch for the same boot parameter:
+ *  Added rootfstype= option: autodetection is unreliable, aeb, 960416
Mount with autodetection is sometimes unreliable; people who need
absolutely reliable operation use mount -t. But at boot time the
kernel just guesses - very un-Unix-like.]
