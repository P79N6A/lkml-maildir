- Did you try with ide=nodma ?
- I've not yet read the full specs of old SiS IDE chips, but there is a 
bug for ATA66 and 33 chips in the stock kernel. Try copying 
http://gyver.homeip.net/sis5513/sis5513-limited.c
 over your 
linux/drivers/ide/sis5513.c. It fixes the bug above and will output your 
IDE Config registers and each change it makes. Please send me the 
"SIS5513: " lines if you can (I'm interested in cases of failure and 
success).

Do you have the motherboard model ?

Perhaps correct init code in sis5513.c for your chip. Send me all info 
requested above and I'll try to sort it out.

The more you send me, the better.
