Subject: [PATCH] consolidate errno definitions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Just remove duplicates among the asm-*/errno.h.
see <
http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~sfr/18-errno.1.diff.gz>
Please have a look and comment.
I assume the differences are due to ABI requirements, if not
then more consolidation is probably possible.
