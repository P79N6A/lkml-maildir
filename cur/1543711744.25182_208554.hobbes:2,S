you're right, I'll fixup. You saved s390 for the second time in a row ;)

agreed.

I agree with you here too, I also preferred not to drop the lock before
return, I did it to reduce the code (in the asm especially).

Agreed. I don't see how could ever lose the dirty bit, however the above
comment is scary, and needs clarification from the hw experts. If it's
not safe we can put it back under the page_map_lock. I don't recall
stuff taking the page_map_lock while holding the mapping locks, so it
should be safe (though if we can do it ouside it's preferable.
