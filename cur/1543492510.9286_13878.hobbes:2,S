Nicholas:
Unfortunately, the BIOS only has provision for "excluding IRQs and
Address Ranges for legacy ISA devices", but not for disabling
Plug-n-Pray.  I looked in the DOS stuff that came with the 3com card,
but nothing let me set the IRQ.  I'll look at the netgear disk and see
if it has anything.  I also tried enabling the Plug-n-Play support in
the 2.2 kernel, but that didn't seem to make any difference.
