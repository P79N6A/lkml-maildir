Does that mean that spamcop does no verification of user reports?
I was under the impression that it's fairly easy to automatically check
whether a particular host is an open-relay or not, so it would seem kind
of irresponsible for spamcop not to do this if some people are relying
on their lists to do blocking (even if there's a disclaimer saying not
to do that, clearly people are ignorant or dumb, so why not play it safe?).
