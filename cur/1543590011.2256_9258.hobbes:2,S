Hi, Andrzej!

It works for me. Thank you! You have even managed to find out that I had
my CD-ROM disconnected :-)
By the way, shouldn't we register sysctl, /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/ and
/dev/cdrom/ always when the cdrom driver is loaded/initialized, not when a
cdrom unit is found?
I don't know what's the official "policy" is, but wouldn't it be logical
to have some control over the drivers that handle no devices in the
moment?
Actually, the scsi module behaves differently. Right now I have empty
/dev/scsi and /proc/scsi/scsi contains "Attached devices: none"
Anyway, the patch is small, straightforward and consistent with the
current behavior of the driver. And it works.
