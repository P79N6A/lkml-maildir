The VM patch went in as soon as none of the people testing
the patch was able to make it crash or behave very badly.
Of course then the increased test base showed up some
locking issues which caused a deadlock on single-cpu
machines ;)
(good thing I have connectivity here at Linux Kongress
so I can log in from the other end of the world and fix
the problems as soon as we find them ;))

Rik
