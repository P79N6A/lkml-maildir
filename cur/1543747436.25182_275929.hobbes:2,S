You didn't read the thread.  I was talking about the page not being
counted as dirty in the first place (bdi->memory_backed = 1).
If you want to see a machine out of physical memory (you can have
plenty of free swap), just try filling up a ramfs filesystem.  Don't
do it on the company's mission critical server though, cause some
people might be unhappy afterwards.
I tried it, and it's not very nice.  Even the OOM killer went to work
though swap was far from full.  And the end result was a perfectly
responsive, but not very useful system.
So please don't try to tell me that:
  a) it will deadlock: it won't, not even if userspace calls back,
  because the memory is _not_ reclaimable
  b) it's not a good solution: I _know_, all I'm trying to show that a
  deadlock is _not_ inherent in a userspace filesystem
Constructive comments are appreciated, others will go to /dev/null.
Thanks,
Miklos
