Sorry for the late reply.
Yes, that does seem to be the problem.
Even with a current -rt (2.6.14-rc2-rt5) UML does not run. The issue is
indeed (as jeff pointed out) that VTALRM is never send. The small test
programm below illustrates this.
On a non-rt kernel it completed in 1 second.
On a -rt kernel it waits at infinitum.
Kind regards,
