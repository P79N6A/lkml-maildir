Subject: 2.2.x crashes when MemShared > 2G?

Hello all.
We have a webhotel setup with linux 2.2.x, running apache 1.3.6(9), with
thousands of namebased virtual hosts. The webhotel data is accessed via nfs 
on another server (also linux). This is with Pentium II's on Asus P2B
motherboards.
Since we started using this setup, we have experienced rather frequent
crashes (ranging from hours to many days in bewteen). Always there were no
useful indications in any logfiles, and no kernel panic messages on the
console.
However we have now noticed one interesting data point. When watching "top",
the shared memory field usually wobbles around 1200000K, but sometimes
spikes upward. I have just now seen it hit over 1800000K. So I suspect our
crashes happen when the shared memory number passes 2097152K, indicating
some signed 32 bit int overflowing and doing nasty things.
We have run kernels 2.2.5-22 and 2.2.12-7 from redhat, and 2.2.7-1.15 and
2.2.7-1.23 from va-linux. The problem appears to surface much much faster
with the 2.2.12-7 kernel, which might indicate that either the 2.2.12 memory
leak patch is not applied in redhats 2.2.12-7 (which I thought it was), or
that some other leak is present.
Any ideas why linux would crash with shared memory > 2G?
