time_after() is useful macro for checking counter which can go MAX-1->MAX->0->1>...

That never happens.

memcg->scan_age is update when 
 - the memcg is root of hierarchy.
 - we reclaim memory from memcg.
So, memcg->scan_age is update by 2 means, all memcg under hierarchy is accessed
by reclaim routine.
example) Consider hierarhy like this.
          xxx(ID=8)
             /yyy (ID=4)
             /zzz (ID=9)
             /www (ID=3)
In this case, scan will be done in following order
  .....->3->4->8->9->3->4->8->9->...
(start point is determined by last_scanned_child)
everytime we visit "8", 8's scan_age is updated.
So, if we see "8"  2 times, all other groups 4,9,3 is all accessed for freeing
memory. (by me or other threads.)
