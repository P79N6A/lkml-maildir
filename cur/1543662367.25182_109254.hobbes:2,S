   The attached change to tg3 causes an MCA on an HP zx6000
   (a 2-CPU IA64 box).  This is with Marcelo's current 2.4.x BK tree
   plus the ia64 patch.  Backing out the change below makes the
   MCA go away.
This sounds like either a bug in your ia64's PCI chipset or
in the tigon3 device.
Which means the only viable solution is to fail to probe this
tigon3 chip on ia64 systems using the same PCI host controller
as you have.
Can you ask a ia64 PCI host controller expert if there are any
known errata in this area?
