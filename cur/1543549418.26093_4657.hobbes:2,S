If you fire off about 20 copies of this, then execute the X-SERVER,
they will eventually all fail. Takes about 20 minutes on my machine.
I tried to update, but they don't support my screen-card anymore. This
was, I think, their first attempt at MMX stuff.
This is an old X-Server:
XFree86 Version 3.3.3.1 / X Window System
(protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6300)
Release Date: December 29 1998
	If the server is older than 6-12 months, or if your card is newer
	than the above date, look for a newer version before reporting
	problems.  (see 
http://www.XFree86.Org/FAQ
)
Here's the test code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <malloc.h>
#define ARRAY_LEN 0x10000
int main()
{
   double *d0, *d1;
   size_t i;
   if((d0 = malloc(ARRAY_LEN *sizeof(double))) == NULL)
   {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation error\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }
   if((d1 = malloc(ARRAY_LEN *sizeof(double))) == NULL)
   {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation error\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }
   for(;;)
   {
       for(i=0; i< ARRAY_LEN; i++)
          d0[i] = cos((double) (i % 60));
       for(i=0; i< ARRAY_LEN; i++)
          d1[i] = cos((double) (i % 60));
       if(memcmp((char*)d0, (char *)d1, ARRAY_LEN * sizeof(double)))
       {
            for(i=0; i< ARRAY_LEN; i++)
                if(d0[i] != d1[i]) break;
            fprintf(stderr, "Floating point error at offset %u ", i);
            fprintf(stderr, "d0[%u]=%f, d1[%u]=%f\n", i, d0[i], i, d1[i]);
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
       }
   }
}
Somebody who has RAID or whatever with MMX may want to try this.
