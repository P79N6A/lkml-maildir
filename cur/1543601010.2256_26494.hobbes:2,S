I am trying to read from a DLT4000 tape.  The device is found and mt can
talk to it.  But if I try a dd I get:
dd if=/dev/st0 of=/tmp/tape.out bs=16k
dd: reading `/dev/st0': Cannot allocate memory
0+0 records in
0+0 records out
If I try to cat the device, still get the "Cannot allocate memory"
cat /dev/st0 > /tmp/tt
cat: /dev/st0: Cannot allocate memory
Tried the same on an older kernel (2.4.8-ac7) and it worked.  Also the
latest Redhat one works (2.4.3).
Is this a known problem? Or can I give someone more diagnostic information?
Thanks,
Ian...
