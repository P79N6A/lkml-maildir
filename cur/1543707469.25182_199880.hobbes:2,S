Christian, Daniel,
Please do
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/vm_gfp_debug
This will print additional information when the "%d-order allocation
failures" messages happen. Please post that information along with the
System.map for the running kernel.
Daniel is seeing a similar problem but running with RAID1 over loop (which
doesnt sound like a good idea to me - but should work anyway).
I suspect the problem is loop allocates its buffers in a way so that the
allocator can't sleep waiting for IO, which in turn overloads the memory
and causes the failures.
