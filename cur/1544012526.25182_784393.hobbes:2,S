Something like this:
+#define raw_smp_processor_id()                                         \
+({                                                                     \
+       extern int gsoff__cpu_number;                                   \
+       int cpu;                                                        \
+       __asm__("movl %%gs:%1, %0" : "=r" (cpu)                         \
+                                  : "m" (gsoff__cpu_number);           \
+       cpu;                                                            \
+})
And add this to vmlinux_64.lds.S:
+#define GSOFF(x) gsoff__##x = per_cpu__##x - per_cpu__pda
+  GSOFF(cpu_number);
The trick is that the linker can calculate against multiple symbols,
but it must be done in the final link.  The problem with this approach
is that only a limited set of symbols can be used.  There isn't a
simple solution for all per-cpu variables.  Some post-processing would
have to be done, similar to kallsyms.
Looking some more at the usage statistics of the PDA members, there
are four heavy hitters:
pda->pcurrent (2719)
pda->kernelstack (1055)
pda->cpunumber (933)
pda->data_offset (327)
The rest of the PDA members have an insignificant number of accesses.
I think for now I'll avoid converting the above four fields until an
optimal solution can be agreed on, but the others (primarily the TLB
and irqstat fields) can be converted without bloating the kernel code
alot.
