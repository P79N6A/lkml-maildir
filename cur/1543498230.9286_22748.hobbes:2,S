It should be easy to get a stack trace using SGI debugger

). It allows you to generate stack
traces from arbitrary processes. I have to say that having it into the
kernel wouldn't be a so bad idea... (it was GPL'd if I remeber well :).

The down failed may happens if the loop file has holes for example. No
idea yet about wait_on_super deadlock though :).
