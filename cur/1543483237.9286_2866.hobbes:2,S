That has been a lie since 1.3 (and possibly even 1.2?).

This is staggeringly untrue.  And not even Linux related.

I'll forget that he probably meant "can execute kernel code" at a time.
Even that's not true.
A lot of kernel calls are still serialised (the read and write paths, for
example), but work to reduce this is proceeding and, as a lot of people
forget, Linux has such low latencies for syscalls (typically around 1/10th
of those for (early?) Solaris/86, I believe) that for many common cases,
the amount of time spent holding the kernel lock is tiny.
Of course, things will have to improve before 64 CPU Linux boxes can scale
properly on io-bound stuff..
