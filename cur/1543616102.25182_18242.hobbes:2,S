Would this also be hacked into whatever Hotswap CPU support exists? Such
that plugging in a new CPU spawns a new cpu/%d directory, (and removing one
deletes the directory), or do we just scan for the total number of possible
slots on boot and rely on any nodes to return -ENODEV or whatever when
there's no CPU physically present? (Probably easier)
(Maybe not smp.c, as this is for Uniprocessor boxen as well, cpu.c? :-)
