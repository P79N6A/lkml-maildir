Totally incorrect.  2.4 allows files larger than 2GB, and with a patch,
you can do this on 2.2 as well.  If you are having problems with a 2GB
limit, then either your shell, libc, or tools is causing the problem.
VFAT does have a 2GB limit, AFAIK, but I could be wrong.

No, the ext2 and ext3 limits are exactly the same, about 4TB right
now, but they would be larger with a bit of bug fixing (up to 16TB).
Note that the kernel has a limit of 2TB for a single device.

As for SMBFS, I don't know, but it can obviously not be larger than the
limit on the server.
