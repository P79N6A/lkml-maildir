So we have drivers/net/pcmcia, but drivers/s390/net ?

Do we have _any_ bus-independent drivers ?  There are things like the serial
driver which work with several busses, but they're not really independent in
the sense that you could add a new bus type without any modifications to the
drivers.  I don't see a problem with putting those into drivers/common or
similar, especially since the drivers I'm aware of still need bus-specific
detection and initialization.
So wouldn't it be the cleanest thing to do to split up the serial driver, put
the generic parts into drivers/common/tty/serial.c, the PCI, ISAPnP, and GSC
things (mostly detection) into drivers/{pci,isapnp,gsc}/serial/serial.c, and
the architecture-dependent default ports into drivers/<arch>/serial/serial.c ?
Basically what I'm proposing is to put drivers into
drivers/<bus or arch>/<function or interface>/<name>.c
it's obvious which APIs a driver uses (the <bus>-specific interface as well as
the <function> abstraction), it helps keep #ifdef noise down (by splitting
things up into separate files), and there is a relatively low number of places
you have to look in for the driver you're searching.
Another advantage is you'd be able to see all pci drivers as drivers/pci/*/*.c,
and all network drivers as drivers/*/net/*.c (especially with the less popular
subsystems / busses, where reading the existing drivers is a good way to find
out API details).
