Then don't think of it that way: think of it as a device which can
have 256 minor variants, no more.  It doesn't matter if we extend the
minor size, the raw character device will still have only 256 minors.
There is nothing in the raw character device which has to cover every
possible minor number: it doesn't work that way.
