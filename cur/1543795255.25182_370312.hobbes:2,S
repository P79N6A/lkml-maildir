Small data point:  In a lot of gcc-related build processes, the 
configure/makefile junk passes '-pthread' to the compiler/linker.
So a lot of programs in Linux distros are already built this way.  The 
bigger problem is with libraries, which cannot know ahead of time 
whether the app is threaded or not, and therefore must assume threaded.
A few libs do things like glibc, others (like GLib) have an explicit 
mylib_thread_init() called at program startup.
