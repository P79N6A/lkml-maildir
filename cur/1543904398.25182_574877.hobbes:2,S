I don't think the details of what Linux code currently exists should 
drive the device tree binding.  That the current patches use 
platform_device glue code is an implementation detail (and one I'd 
rather see go away, in favor of a driver that supports both 
platform_device and of_device).

Sure, that's always good...  it was the "instead" that I objected to.
