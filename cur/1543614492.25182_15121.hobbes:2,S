Hi
I have problem with SB-FMI16 radio
I use plain 2.4.5 kernel from Slackware 8.0
1. I compile module for radio-sb16fmi  - that's ok
2. I /sbin/modprobe radio-sb16fmi io=0x284  - that's ok
3. When I try to control radio I hear nothing 
What is this ???
PS In RedHat 6.2 - it work's without problem ???
