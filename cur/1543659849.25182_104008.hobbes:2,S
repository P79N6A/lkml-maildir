Interesting - I'd only seen open source CPU projects which were at the
planning stage.
It seems that most of the components necessary to build a usable
machine are at least well-advanced, although most of the non-CPU parts
are based around the WISHBONE interface, whereare most of the CPUs are
not, so maybe the goal is further away than it first appears, but
still, progress is being made.
Do you know of anybody who has actually made a prototype board from
any of these CPU designs?  Is my idea of running a lot of simple CPUs
together fundamentally flawed, or is it possible to overcome the
inefficiencies of SMP, if the CPUs are designed for it from the ground
up?
To be honest I am really begining to get bored with i386-based
systems, and I'm hoping to move away from them entirely at the
earliest opportunity.  Hopefully I'll be building my next machine
around an UltraSPARC, but I've really been a bit too busy with other
projects lately...
John.
