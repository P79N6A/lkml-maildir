Just as a note I find it extremly useful in some case to be able
to run gdb on a kernel.  As said by Andrew it's less the tradition
debugging but more to get a picture of what's going on.
But kgdb traditionally was more than just a simple gdb stub and
contained hooks all over the place for additional functionality.
I don't think all this is a good idea and I'd be against it.
I'd be really happy to see a common gdb stub with small arch support
that allows attaching gdb to the kernel through various transports.
Maybe someone is up to do just that?  Even the full blown kgdb with
all the hooks would benefit from having the gdb stub already in,
so maybe I could motivate some kgdb developers to do that work?
