A suitable policy for a backup program would probably be to invalidate any
output file(s) and to invalidate those pages of the input files which were
not in cache when the backup program first opened those files.  That way
the backup program will have no effect on the cache state, except for the
race situation where someone read an uncached file while the backup program
was reading from it too.
This can be added in an hour or two with no kernel changes (use mincore).
