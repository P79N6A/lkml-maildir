I think both ways are good. I don't recall automated testing ever
finding a bug in any of my code that wasn't alpha. However, we _do_ add
tests for bugs that are found and fixed for two reasons: 1) To make sure
we actually fixed it, 2) Sometimes bugs come back - especially when all
your fix did was to temporarily mask it.
Stupid little repeat-glitches are the biggie...especially when you have
more than one person working on the code.
