No. It is NOT the only reason. 
Some driver have a "lowerlevel" driver that needs to be included or
can be loaded as a module whenever the driver is enabled.
This happens to be the case with sx, rio and generic_serial. So both
SX and RIO, when enabled pull in generic_serial, which gets sorted out
by the sort-and-uniqify. 
I used to have horrendously complicated Makefile rules to get this
right, but this was simplified enormously by the "eliminate duplicate 
objects" that is now in the Makefiles.
