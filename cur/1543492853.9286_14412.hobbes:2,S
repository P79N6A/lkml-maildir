Is there any reason for making the swap space on a primary partition as
opposed to an extended partition?  I've got two swaps for a total of
254M, both on extended partitions on my only HD in the machine.  128M of
that goes exclusively to DB2 beta, of course,  and everything seems to
working cheerfully.  Unless, of course, we've somehow managed to get rid
of the 128M limit on swap partition size with the 2.2.x kernels?
