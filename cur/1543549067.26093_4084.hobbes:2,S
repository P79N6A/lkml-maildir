Actually, hold off a moment.
It turns out that the MODULE case does all the right things, for all the
obvious reasons. I'm running a kernel that has the #ifdef MODULE stuff
just removed, and it seems to be a rather easy approach. It really only
required making a few things static (the init routines would clash
otherwise), and removing a lot of #ifdef MODULE.
(And removing some code that was enabled only for non-modules).
It looks very straightforward.
