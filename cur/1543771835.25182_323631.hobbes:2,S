You still need to disable IRQs on chip tho before you free_irq or you'll
put other devices sharing your interrupt in real pain in case your hw
accidentally emits one :)

Yes. free_irq above would be equivalent to synchronize_irq() and a good
replacement for it. With it, you don't even need the me->sleeping & test
in the IRQ handler since you simply cant call the IRQ handler after it's
free'd :)
