It makes perfect sense.  Components drawing power produce heat, which
causes a temperature rise above ambient.  Put simply, if a chip that
fails at a case temperature of 50C and you have a 10C rise, it'll fail
at 40C. If you have a 20C rise, it'll fail at 30C.
PS, the efficiency of heatsinks is measured in degC/W - how many degrees
celcius the temperature rises for each watt of power dissipated.  Double
the dissipated power, double the temperature rise.
