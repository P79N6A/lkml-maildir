Tony,
I've updated our ftp site with a new patch.
o Took out the Hotplug Kconfig mod (Tony's request)
o removed Lindent changes for non-sn files (Tony's request)
o SN_SAL_IOIF_RRB_ALLOC is gone (Christoph's request)
o added domain arg to the SAL calls that had bus/device (Christoph's request)
o improved pci_dma.c (Christoph's request)
o removed unused SNDRV_SHUB_??? defs (Christoph's request)
o added our own pci_ops (Grant/Matthew's request)
Patches are here:
ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/sn2/sn2-update/001-kill-files
ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/sn2/sn2-update/002-add-files
I also put a separate patch for the qla code:
