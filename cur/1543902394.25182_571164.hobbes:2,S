Hi Tejun,
Thanks for tracking this down and fixing it.

The "symlink" is released? But the creation of the symlink is
precisely what failed here ... did it not?

And again ... the changelog sounds confusing indeed, perhaps I'm
not familiar enough with sysfs symlink-related terminology/semantics.
Care to elaborate?

Wow. This looks like a very mysterious way to fix a mysterious bug :-)

unnecessarily complicated/obfuscated ...
Thanks again,
