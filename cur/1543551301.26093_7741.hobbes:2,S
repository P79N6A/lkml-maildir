What were you expecting from the system call section of the Linux

That's usually what happens.

Closed-source software is *so* 20th century... ;-)  Anyway, when run
from the shell it'll inherit its parent's limits (which leads to your
next question...)

Certainly.
Maybe if more distributions took Debian's stance and set the default
limits so anal that you frequently can't even read email let alone
recompile the kernel without getting the process terminated for tripping
one limit or another, then more people would know this functionality
exists and set the limits more appropriately.
