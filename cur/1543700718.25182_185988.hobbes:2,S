Hi All,
I am working on an oracle9i problem and have been liasing with their
support. However we keep seeing crashes for the oracle dispatcher process,
which is like a TCP port listener agent.
We've been working on this problem for around 6 months now and still yet to
have a solution. I have just noticed that in each of our core dump files
(20+) there is a pattern. Each time the problem occurs (crash) it references
the same code, function call and what appears to be a memory address, or a
register address.
I don't know memory/registers that well and was just wondering if there is a
way I can identify where this "memory" is, is it virtual/chips/registers if
so is there someway in /proc that I can identify what memory bank or chip is
it. Below is the core dump and the line which the core dump references each
time begins with "> ". It seems this function call (including the exact
paramters and memory addresses) is common in all core dumps. Has anyone seen
this kinda of situation before? Any ideas would be great :)
