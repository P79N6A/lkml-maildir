Oh, it was this Kernel Summit presentation which discussed it
http://licensing.steeleye.com/support/papers/kernel_summit_iommu.pdf
The writeup of the session is here:
http://lwn.net/Articles/144100/
The idea was basically to match an allocation to a device mask.  I was
going to do a generic implementation (which would probably kmalloc,
check the physaddr and fall back to GFP_DMA if we were unlucky) but
allow the architectures to override.
However, the majority of need (except for the aacraid like devices) was
solved by GFP_DMA32
