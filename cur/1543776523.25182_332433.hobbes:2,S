-	  Some video adapters have more than one tuner inside. This patch
-	  enables support for using more than one tuner. This is required
-	  for some cards to allow tunning  both video and radio.
-	  It also improves I2C autodetection for these cards.
-
-	  Only few tuners currently is supporting this. More to come.
-
-	  It is safe to say 'Y' here even if your card has only one I2C tuner.
