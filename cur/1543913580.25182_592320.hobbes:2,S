The subject is rather confusing.  What I ported to markers is the spu _tracing_
support.  And given it's never been public before adding the port part to the
commit doesn't make much sense.
Nevermind, I have updated version of this and would prefer to submit it myself
through the spufs maintainer once markers make mainline (hopefully soon!)
I'll also need more cleanups like adding a config option for it.
