Use is another way of advocacy.  When you start using something, you get
used to it, and when you talk to others, you end up advocating it because
it's what you're used to, and probably other options aren't as good (to you).
IIRC, bitkeeper, is open source.  It just doesn't have a free license.  I
could be wrong(I haven't checked).  If I am, someone will say so...
