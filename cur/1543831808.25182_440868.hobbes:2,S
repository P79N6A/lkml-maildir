I do not believe that Bret Towe has more devices than
MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS=8.

It is number TO write but I said about number after what user has to
write-out all dirty pages.

Imagine that CONFIG_NR_CPUS=1 for smp.
Kernel has a lot of "big enough" constants.

Exactly to the contrary: as I explained to you, if you have more devices
than pdflush threads, your patch will result in all system doing IO as
slow as slowest devices in the system. In addition, if you have more
than MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS processors, some of them cannot be used to
concurrently perform writeback.

To understand the problem I am trying to attract your attention to,
imagine that MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS equals 1. See what you get? BSD
(pagedaemon everybody waits upon). But Linux is not BSD, thankfully.

Yes, and all the world is VAX (var. "my benchmarking suite"), as they
used to say. :-)
