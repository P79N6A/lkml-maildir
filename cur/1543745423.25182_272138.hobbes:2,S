Hello,
If I have a MUTEX in a driver and the driver can
also be called from a signal handler, will the
MUTEX deadlock when the signal handler calls the
driver?
Code --->----> driver-->MUTEX-taken-->***SIGNAL***
Signal handler --->driver--->MUTEX-waiting (will it deadlock?)
I use 'down()' and 'up()' in the driver. With Linux-2.4.22 the
code does not deadlock. With Linux-2.6.9, it does.
Is this the expected behavior? FYI I wrote the driver, not the
dumb code that calls it from a signal handler. I would never
have called anything by printf() from such a handler, so
don't preach to the choir. I just need to know if it should
work, before I tell somebody to rewrite some code.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
