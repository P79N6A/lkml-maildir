Hi. I can't seem to get the 2940UW Pro going with 2.2 kernel versions > 2.2.12.
Aic7xxx drivers > 5.1.19 dont seem to work. Also, no go with 2.3.x, as it
seems to be using the same driver version as 2.2.14.
Trying the 5.1.25 aic7xxx driver didn't help either.
Increasing driver verbosity to maximum, shows that it gets stuck in a loop
of aic7xxx_reset_device(), as it repeatedly prints the message 
"Cleaning up status information and delayed_scbs".
Hardware:
    Adaptec 2940UW Pro (BIOS rev 2.11.0)
    Fujitsu MAB3091SP 8.7GB Ultrawide 7000rpm drive
    Gigabyte GA-BX2000 motherboard
Any ideas as to what could be the problem?  Please cc all replies, as I'm
not subscribed to l-k for traffic reasons.
I don't know if this has any relevance, but the FreeBSD driver seemed to work,
until I got a panic when trying to do a newfs on the drive.  Windows *seems*
to have no problem with the combo, couldn't say for sure :)
Thanks,
Leon.

I'm a cynic, but my heart's not in it.
