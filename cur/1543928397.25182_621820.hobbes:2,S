The problem with "one freezer" is that "known consistent state" means  
something completely different to every single driver and subsystem.   
Xen wants it to mean "No pending page table updates and no more  
updates from this point forward".  A network driver wants it to mean  
"All pending network packets DMAed out or in and the device shut down  
with all remaining packets queued.  A SATA controller wants it to  
mean "All DMA quiesced and no more commands", etc.
The only way to have that work is to put minimal definitions of what  
state you care about in the drivers themselves.  For Xen this means  
that you need to have an appropriately-timed suspend handler which  
hooks into Xen code very precisely to create and preserve the "No  
pending page table updates" state that you care about.  It will be  
more work in the short term but it's the only maintainable solution  
in the long term IMO.
