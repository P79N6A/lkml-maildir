 The generic problem with the generic driver is it only supports the bare 
minimum an RTC might support and no way to provide access to what more 
sophisticated hardware may implement (e.g. an IRQ).  There is simply no 
room for that in the API.  And I have seen proposals for reducing the 
MC146818 to GEN_RTC, too...
 It's certainly good enough for simple implementations of RTCs, like a 
battery backed-up 32-bit register counting milliseconds since the 
beginning of the year (a so-called TOY clock).
