All the other fields in there are using kbytes.  We might as well be
consistent.
Plus if we express the quantity in bytes, userspace doesn't need to know
what the pagesize is.  If we were to express it in pages, an app on a 64k
pagesize kernel will show very different numbers from the same app on a 4k
pagesize kernel.
