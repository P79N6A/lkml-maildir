I wonder if what you're seein is related to
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/16/73
You said that you don't see any corruption with 2.6.18.  Can you try
to apply the patch from
http://www2.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=d08b3851da41d0ee60851f2c75b118e1f7a5fc89
to 2.6.18 to see if the corruption shows up?
