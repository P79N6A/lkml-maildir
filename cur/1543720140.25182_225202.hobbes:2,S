Hi Arjan, how is this different from the last time this patch was posted?
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108087017610947&w=2
The hugetlbfs and SHM_LOCK bits don't work well with rlimits.  For
example, it's trivial to corrupt the locked_vm count with a SHM_LOCK
segment.  I like this, but I think it only works with mlock().  Did I
miss something?
thanks,
-chris
