Hello,
Does anyone develop a __filter_level_layer_device_driver__ between the
file system and an actual disk device driver?
We'd like to develop the I/O shut-off feature for a fail-over-cluster
system.  Our cluster system will be attached to shared storage by SCSI
or FiberChannel interface.  To implement a strict mutual exclusion for
the shared strage, the data destruction can be prevented.  By this
feature, our cluster will do not lead the data destruction in case of
the split brain syndrome or some malfunctions.
Another advantages of this __filter_level_layer_device_driver__ are
for example to enable followings.
- virus scanning
- HBA (SCSI or FC card) duplexing and path switching
- software raid disk
- network data replication or a network raid disk
  (if the network device can be placed as a lower level device)
Best regards, KOYAMA Keiichi
