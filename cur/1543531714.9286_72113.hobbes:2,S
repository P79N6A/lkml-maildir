That should be eth0.  cardmgr (3.1.13) tries to do:
/etc/pcmcia/network start 3c575_cb
and fails because I can't ifconfig 3c575_cb
By the way, ejecting the card caused an oops in pre3.  Anyone interested,
I'll see if I can recreate it (It didn't get dumped and I'm having wrist
problems) and post it.
