HI!
> Add an x86 instruction emulator for kvm.
> 
> We need an x86 emulator for the following reasons:
> 
> - mmio instructions are intercepted as page faults, with no information about
>   the operation to be performed other than the virtual address
> - real-mode is emulated using the old-fashined vm86 mode, with no special
>   intercepts for the privileged instructions, so we need to emulate mov cr,
>   lgdt, and lidt
> - we plan to cache shadow page tables in the future, so that a guest context
>   switch will not throw away all the mappings we worked so hard to build.  but
>   cachine page tables means write-protecting the guest page tables to keep
>   them in sync, so any writes to the guest page tables need to be emulated
> 
> The emulator was lifted from the Xen hypervisor.

This needs GPL, I'd say.
