Oh, man, it seems that I *must* repeat myself one more time, at least
to see if I'm not in everyone's killfile :-)

I don't know if that's what /he/ is arguing, but *I* am arguing that 
in the cases I've seen here and in debian-legal, we have the following 
circumstances (the qla2xxx/ql2100_fw.c canonical example):
* the file in question (and its brothers and cousins) have the 
following structure IIRC:
	+ GPL license comment-header
	+ some includes?
	+ the firmware in c-blob format or unsigned char fw[] = ....
	+ nothing else.
* as the file is clearly marked by the copyright holder as being 
_distributed under the terms of the GPL_ and no other format is given 
to modify the fw[], at least *legally* is MHO that any 
recipient/redistributor of the file _can_ and _must_ consider the file 
in *that* format as the preferred form for modification (pf4m) *and*, 
considering it the source code, follow the directions of the GPL in 
respect to modification and redistribution.
* the /status quo/ obtained by observation of the previous item 
prevails _until somebody proves_ that the fw[] = {} is *not* the 
source code; this, usually, can be proven only by confession, i.e., 
the original copyright holder *comes out and says:* "hmmm, this is not 
the source code". Notice that the copyright holder maintaining silence 
is _not_ confession.
* in this case (copyright holder confesses it's not the source code) 
applied to the examples in casu, i.e., firmware, the kernel people 
cannot distribute the binary blob *inside the kernel tree*, but can do 
it separately _if the copyright holder grants a license_ to.
* even so, Debian could not distribute it.

But there are cases, even if you don't know of them. And this is the 
case that has to be taken in account when we start *presuming* things, 
at least legally, IMHO.
