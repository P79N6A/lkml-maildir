Hi, I noticed that Ingo released a low-latency patch for the 2.2.13
kernel.
2.2.10-lowlatency was not optimized for SMP low-latency ( latencytest on
/proc stress gives high latencies).
Does anyone (Ingo in particular) know if the 2.2.13 is SMP optimized ?
(spinlock changes)
I'm developing a threaded realtime benchmark to see how well this works
on
SMP hardware. ( I will test the behaviour on my dual Celeron)
Benno.
