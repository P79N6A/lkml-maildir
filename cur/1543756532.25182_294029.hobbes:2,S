Touchscreens are one class of devices where the serial attachment is not
dying.

I don't think so. I don't think the saving of code is worth the
obfuscation, after all, 6 drivers is still not so much.
Also, direct code implementation can implement better synchronization
methods and faster resynchronization in case of lost bytes.
And then there are protocols like the Gunze one, which wouldn't be
covered by this.

I can understand that, however, when the only difference is in the
actual _mounting_ of the hardware ... I'm not so sure.

We could have a library that would do that and link applications against
it. It could also handle things like tap-n-drag, etc, something we
certainly don't want in the kernel.

I agree with that. It could possibly even be put into the inputattach
init routine for the specific touchscreen.

And this is something the kernel certainly won't do. Floating point math
is possible in the kernel with some jumping through hoops, but avoiding
it is usually the better option.

In that case I'm not sure if the kernel should care at all what the data
is.

Yes, embedded and single purpose systems are often full of hacks like
this.
