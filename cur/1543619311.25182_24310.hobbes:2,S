Please! People, if you don't know exactly what you are talking about, at
least keep your replies off list.
The problem he's having is caused by nagle, I replied to him off list
because not knowing the API to disable a perfectly standard TCP behavior is
not related to kernel development.
I get enough traffic from this list without having a dozen blind people
trying to lead the blind.
It's great that you are trying to be helpful, but please do it off list,
unless it's actual pertinent to kernel development.
[For future archive searchers: The solution is to set the TCP_NODELAY socket
option]
