correct.

correct.  For PCI drivers, change to something like
  printk(KERN_INFO "tulip(%s): stuff\n", pci_dev->slot_name);

hrm.  I'm not sure it's necessary to pass driver_name to alloc_etherdev
(to set dev->name), just to be able to reference solely from the driver
during the probe phase.  Further there is a dev->name size limit you
will run into with "myverylongdrivernameskimbosh."
Just pass 'name' arg to wait_for_completion ;-)
