This when combined with other boot reduction patched can bring the kernel boot time to well under 10 seconds, in most cases two or three seconds.  In a desktop system this patch is probably insignificant, howerver several patches like this in a set top box or cell phone will be signicant.
Please wordwrap your emails at column 72 or thereabouts.

You should send the patches to this mailing list, just as you have done here.

What patch was that?

Finish the patches and just send them.  No fuss.  See
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
 for a few details.

This particular feature seems to be ppc-specific and hence the folks at
linuxppc-dev@lists.linuxppc.org should be involved.  Probably the
CONFIG_RTC_NO_SYNC Kconfig option should be in arch/ppc/Kconfig - one would
need to see all the patches to determine that.
It might be better to use a kernel boot option rather than another
compile-time option for this - you'd need to discuss that with other ppc
people.   Or perhaps the code in there is just being dumb and can be fixed.
In general, it's taking waaaay to long to get all these CELinux patches
into the outside world.  Thanks for getting this one on the wires.  Let's
get them all done and finish this thing.
