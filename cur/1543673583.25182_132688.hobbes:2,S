Very strange as nothing fundamental changed.  
The only thing I did was inline use_mm into kexec piece.  And
to make the cpu shutdown code safe from an interrupt context.

And Andrew has it in 2.5.69-mm4 and is busy pestering me about compile
errors.  There needs to be an updated version where all of the
appropriate functions have the noreturn attribute.  Hopefully
