I have the same problem with my PowerPC board, these functions at this time
are
used only for quick byte copy, and the little endian to big endian
conversion break data.
The problem is still here in 2.2.14 PPC, hdparm -c 1 turn on IDE 32 bit mode
that use
these functions, and this mode of operation is unusable without hacks ...
In my opinion we need new functions for quick byte copy, with new names.
The names insw/outsw/insl/outsl are to close to inw, outw, insw...;
these functions work with the PCI bus, and data need a conversion to
little-endian,
before read and write operation.
We need new functions and fix the kernel.
