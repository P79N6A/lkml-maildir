The reason drivers can use __module_param_call is that they can
implement their own "types" for module parameters, which will end up
requiring this.
Using it directly is only really for backwards compatibility (which is
important!), but for new parameters, this multi-part self-parsing is
nasty.  Standard (but admittedly suboptimal) way to do this is having
three parameters module_param_array(name, ...),
module_param_array(header_offset, ...),
module_param_array(data_start, ...).
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
