Yes.  Some arch files change CROSS_COMPILE after CC has been set and
expect the change to flow into the definition of CC.  This "feature"
only works because '=' stores the value as text and reevaluates the
text each time, automatically picking up any changes to CROSS_COMPILE.
Using CC := might break m68k and mips.  The makefile redesign for 2.5
will fix this problem once and for all.
