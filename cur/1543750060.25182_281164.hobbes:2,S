Hi
The following patch will make the driver work a lot better:

Seriously, there are no known outstanding bugs in b44 (if there are, I'd
really like to know. Just sold my b44-based motherboard so don't have the
hardware to test things, though, so no promises about fixes :-) ). Two
remaining issues are missing Wake on LAN support and the use of lots of
GFP_DMA memory (which is unfortunately required to work around a hardware
bug which only shows up with non-standard memory layouts and > 1GB of
memory), which may result in out of memory errors if the module gets loaded
a long time after booting. That was the only way of fixing the bug, alas,
the bcm4400 driver doesn't have a fix mind you and will happily crash & burn
on 4:4 split kernels.
As for bcm4400 yes it does work (as long as you don't hit the hardware bug
:-) ). The problem is that it's not a Linux driver but a "generic" (windows?)
driver with abstraction on top (> 6000 lines of code vs. < 2500 for 
b44) and a glue layer to interface with Linux. 
Not really maintainable in the standard kernel tree where the idea is that
if someone changes some API (lets say PCI) they have to fix all the users of
the API as well. If all drivers look and smell the same the changes are
pretty easy to make and verify. If people have to look at 15 different
vendor abstraction layers and understand what requirements they have, this
is no longer the case.
