I run RHEL3 2.4.21-20.EL on several servers over here,
and in that role it works great.
You should only use gcc-3.2.3 to compile RHEL3 kernels.
The old 2.4 code base has problems with later gcc versions;
they've been fixed in 2.4.28-pre/rc, but that doesn't
help you with your 2.4.21-based RHEL kernel.
And as Arjan wrote, you must do a mrproper before configuring
and building the kernel and modules.

Just about any one of {2.95.3, 3.2.3, 3.3.5, 3.4.3}.
