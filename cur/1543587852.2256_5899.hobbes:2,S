Well, where is that mailing list?

Exactly the same as the one from 2.4.3:

Sorry for the strange looking of my copy and paste to vim...
Maybe the driver don't like IRQ sharing, but I can't change it: aic7xxx
and usb are onboard, and changing the IRQ for aic7xxx change also the
one from usb (P2B-LS mother board).

So, as my only change in config betweem 2.4.3 and 2.4.3-ac[137] was the
removing of devfs, that's not the problem...
Thanks you very much for your answer,
