Well this is unrelated to your problem, but as a side-note: if you are
planning on using 2.4 going forward, you may need to upgrade some of your
OS-related tools like modutils, binutils, e2fsprogs, et al.  Look in
Documentation/Changes.
Again, this has nothing to do with your current memory hole issues, but it
is something to consider if you solve your memory hole issues.
I seem to remember being able to map out ranges of memory either as
parameters to the kernel.. or by editing a source file--so that if you
know the linear address of the memory range you want to omit, you can do
so.  Actually I think to do this you may need to modify one of the kernel
source files.  If you are willing to do this write me back and I will try
hard and remember which file you have to modify...
