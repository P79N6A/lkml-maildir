(no-one with a g965 mobo who uses the serial port?)
Hi,
I'm trying to figure out a problem that I have with 2 different
motherboards. Both have the Intel G965 chipset, an Intel DG965WH and a
Gigabyte 965G-DS3. What happens is, that datacommunication, either
through normal receiving bytes and via fiddling with signalling lines
(for a dcf-77 radio clock) don't work. To be honest I used a vendor
kernel, a Debian 2.6.22-3-amd64 image.
Is this a known problem?
