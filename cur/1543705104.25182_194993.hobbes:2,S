The RedHat bug suggests 'static const' as the appropriate replacement.

Unfortunately that probably means an extra 64 bytes of text, rather than
the 10 or so bytes of instructions to do the memset and store.  Ideally
padding[] would be allocated in BSS rather than text or the stack (and
initialized with { 0x80, } at runtime), but I guess you can't have
everything.
