That's just nonsense in a consolidated market.
You change to IBM, then to Dell, then to HP
then again to IBM. Maybe you even try Sun.
That causes you more grief than any one of them.
I have seen people doing that in all industry branches
and even privately.
If you love brands, then your choice becomes very limited.
That's the real reason for them being much more expensive.
If you think machines and specs, then you have a much more clear
picture. After a while you even have your own measures for failure 
rates of those components and can handle it. No matter which brand :-)
