Oh yes the try_to_free_buffers race, I think, does exist in older kernels.
Yes according to our earlier analysis it would trigger with UP+preempt and
SMP.
But the patch that Andrea was pointing to was your last patch (The Fix),
which stopped page_mkclean caller throwing out dirty bits. You probably
didn't see that in the mail I cc'ed you on.
So yes it would be interesting to see whether fixing try_to_free_buffers
fixes Andrea's problem on older kernels.
