Those changes will only affect drivers, there is still need for
some mecanism to deal with fbcon. I'll send you a patch before the
end of the week hopefully. There may be a better way of doing it
than my patch by having fbcon be someway a child of the HW driver
in the device-tree, but it's a bit nasty right now, and my patch
adds a more generic way to notify "clients" of fbdev's (like fbcon)
of events at the low level that could be used for hotplug monitor
change notification or whatever...
