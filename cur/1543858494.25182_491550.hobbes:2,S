More items will be added to that list soon.
E.g. Linux Binary only, Creative X-Fi sound card drivers for Q2 2007.

Is there a list of "new unsupported hardware" ?
Reverse engineering or datasheets is the only way out of that.
As Linux becomes more and more popular on the desktop, manufacturers 
will start feeling the pain of Linux "unsupported hardware" and have to 
back down and release datasheets. Ubuntu is helping a lot in that direction.

Well, once a device has been reverse engineered and GPLed, the specs are 
then in public domain and the IP does not exist any more. It actually 
helps the company release the specs once the information is already out 
there. The company then sees less reason to hold onto their specs in the 
first place, and tends to release them earlier next time.

I agree, as time goes by, more and more devices are reverse engineered 
or the manufacturer finally sees sense and releases the specs/datasheets.
