I thought using secids was verboten as it made things too specific.
Have you example code for the security hook you mention?  I'm not sure I
understand why security_secctx_to_secid() is not sufficient.
Or is it that I need something that takes a secctx, converts it to a secid and
authorises its use all in one go?  If it's this, why can't that be rolles into
security_task_kernel_act_as()?  That sets up a task_security struct which is
then switched in and out without consultation of the LSM.
