Hi,
If you are wanting to build multiple versions of the same kernel to
test things out, it would be really handy to have a LOCALVERSION
variable that could be easily overridden.  I used to just play with
EXTRAVERSION, but that has become increasingly inappropriate and it
really would be nicer to just be able to do make O=outputdir
LOCALVERSION=aversion and have it appended so uname reports something
useful.
I just tried the attached, which works but having a dummy dependency
to make the version.h check run all the time is a bit ugly.  I can't
think of another way to indicate to make to update version.h if I
compile once with LOCALVERSION variable set from the command line, and
once without.
Anyway, is the general idea workable?
