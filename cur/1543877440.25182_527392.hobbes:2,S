- often module maintainers disappear suddenly or slowly without any
  clear statement that maintainership ended
- most drivers are not maintained on a per-driver but on a per-subsystem
  basis
Consider that we don't even manage to keep MAINTAINERS correct, and 
consider that we are talking about more than 2800 modules.
Realistically, users should report problems with vendor kernels to the 
vendor and problems with ftp.kernel.org kernels to either linux-kernel 
or the kernel Bugzilla, and forwarding issues to the responsible people 
(if any) should be done there [1].
