It's not a function. It is actual op-codes. If you compile with
'486 or higher, the C compiler is free to spew out these op-codes
any time it thinks it's a viable instruction sequence. Since
it basically replaces two other op-codes, gcc might certainly use
if for optimization.
This is independent of the macro that is defined in a header to
use this sequence .
