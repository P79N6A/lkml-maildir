No doubt X was a bit smoother at 100Hz in 2.5, but not remarkably so. In 2.4 
O(1) there was a slight X flutter (jerkiness) at 1000Hz not evident at 100Hz, 
but very consistent in the frequency/duration of that jerkiness. The 
difference is in 2.5, when X is not smooth it's almost like there's jitter in 
the jerkiness.
