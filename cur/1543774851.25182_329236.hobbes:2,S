What happens when the ext3 inode tables get hit by sector damage? Like
us, ext3 has data munging if you hit the wrong thing, its just that our
sources of data munging are different in the details.  Details matter
though, and so we are improving with each release, and V4 does have some
real improvements.  I hope the next major release will have atomic
transactions that don't have that niggling 5% left undone that prevents
them from being fully there, and then reiser4 can seriously advance the
field of reliability in filesystems rather than just playing catchup.
Good luck with ext3,
Hans
