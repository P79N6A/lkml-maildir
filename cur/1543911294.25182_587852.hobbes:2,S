As I mentioned in the branch of the discussion which lost the Cc: LKML,
this kind of bug looks like requiring a good look at the interaction of
raw1394's and ohci1394's locking (and maybe ieee1394's, but this seems
less likely).
It's hard work, and I don't have much experience with the code in
question nor do I have much time at the moment nor is there anybody else
who fixes ieee1394 subsystem bugs on a regular basis.  Nevertheless,
this kind of bugs should still be fixed in the "old" drivers.  They
haven't reached their end of life yet.
