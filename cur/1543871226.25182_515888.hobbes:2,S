Hmm. Personally I prefer the earlier style, but I haven't the last word on 
this.

Indeed. For instance this patch is wrong, I did this once in a patch, and I 
saw it another time in current Ubuntu kernels:
-	a + b / 4
+	a + b >> 2
This is instead needed:
+	a + (b >> 2)

I must, indeed - your comment points out the symlink issue, which I didn't 
think of, and which makes my patch moot.

I gave a look, and it's nice. Except that maybe "escapes_jail" would be a 
clearer name (there's confusion about the subject of "escaping").
Also, what about concurrent UML threads caring about current directory? I know 
that without SMP/preemption we can't have this problem, but when I see this I 
count a future bug unless this is checked (I think I reason mathematically 
about correctness, even if not formally).
And I haven't the time to check this - I think your version could be merged 
anyway, but I'm not sure.
