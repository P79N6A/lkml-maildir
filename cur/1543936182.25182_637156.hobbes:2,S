I'm afraid that's insufficient motivation for this change. All documentation and real world tests say that MMC and SD 4-bit data is 100% compatible. So it's far more probable that you've misdiagnosed your error than this being the actual problem. The fact that 4-bit MMC support has been present for some time and you're only now seeing a problem further supports that.
In light of that, the suggested patch would not only be incorrect, it would also be worse than doing nothing. You would be papering over a symptom, making the real problem harder to find.
If you want something ready for upstream, for now I suggest removing MMC_CAP_4_BIT_DATA completely from your driver's caps field.
