Yeah, I'm getting unsubbed from some mailing lists because of 
excessive bounces.

I think I found it, that miss-spelling was how it was here in kmails 
folder preferences when the "folder contains a mailing list" option 
is checked.  There I had the vgr as you see, instead of vger.
I'm pretty sure that fixes at least one glitch, and may explain why 
some of my messages have been ignored.  I may not have seen the 
bounce message because most of them are spam and are sorted to a 
folder thats autocleaned when I quite kmail.
But then I'm an old fart, and easliy ignored most of the time too :-)

They are in fact, in plain english, a pain in the ass. Miss-configured 
pieces of M$ driven crap, occasionally viri infected even, up and 
down like a Duncan yoyo.  Here about a year ago, I had just setup a 
new Seimans dsl router.  It had been setup about 2 weeks, when one 
day it wasn't working again and I couldn't access its web page.  
There was just one line in my logs, giving their DNS's machines ip as 
the cuplrit, indicating it had been hacked and they had actually 
gotten thru to my firewall machine, but portsentry is set to be 
paranoid & shut them off on the first syn packet.  The router had 
been hacked, the password and apparently its ip address had been 
hacked, I couldn't find a button to restore factory defaults, so I 
said screw it, gave it back to Circuit City and brought home a 
linksys for twice the money.  It's been bulletproof so far.

Thats possible, I've run query's to it, had them fail, work 10x in a 
row, and fail twice in a row, all in the space of a minute or less.
[snip the rest]
Many thanks for looking into it, as usual, I was the little boy crying 
wolf. Since I'll be 70 shortly, thats not a pretty sight :-)
