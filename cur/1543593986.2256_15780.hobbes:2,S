	I have to say I find this likely to be the case for those who are
	having issues with rsync over ssh.  I was recently playing with
	rsync over ssh (newer openssh to older openssh) and was just using
	it as a pass-through to another machine.
	When I replaced ssh with rinetd, everything worked fine.  I havn't
	had a chance yet (though I'd like to) to try with two recent versions
	of ssh but I'm curious what the result will be.  It may be that the
	problem has been fixed in later versions of ssh.
