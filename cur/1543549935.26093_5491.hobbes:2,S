Subject: [PATCH] BTTV: add new card (PixelView PlayTV PAK)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Howdy!
This patch adds a new card to the bttv (0.7.43) v4l driver. This is the most
recent version of bttv, it will probably NOT apply cleanly to a stock 2.4.x
kernel (and don't bother trying to apply it to anything less than 2.4.x). To
apply this patch, first apply the bttv 0.7.43 patch
(
http://www.strusel007.de/linux/bttv/bttv-0.7.43-2.4.0-test8.diff.gz
 or a later
version), and THEN apply this patch.
I tested this patch with a Lenco MXTV 9578 CP (rebranded Prolink PV-BT878P+4E
(PixelView PlayTV PAK)), it works for me. The digital camera (Rockwell
QuartzSight) which comes with this card does not work yet, since it uses a
digital video mode for the Bt878 which is not supported by bttv (yet).
keywords: Prolink PV-BT878P+ PixelView PlayTV PAK bttv Rockwell QuartzSight
This card also provides a remote control which can be used with LIRC after
applying a patch which I'll send to the LIRC developers.
Here's the patch... It is made against the bttv-0.7.43 distribution, to apply
it against a (patched) kernel version you have to go to the
driver/media/video/bttv directory and apply using the -p2 parameter to patch.
