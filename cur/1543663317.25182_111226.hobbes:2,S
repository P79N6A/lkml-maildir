Those messages point to an interrupt routing problem.  The driver is
not able to see interrupts from the chip, so timeouts occur.  Have
you tries some of the various "apic/noapic" kernel options to see if
your interrupt routing improves?  Often switching between UP and
SMP kernels will change how interrupt routing is performed too.
