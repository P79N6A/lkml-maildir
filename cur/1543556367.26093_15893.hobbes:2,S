Mourad,
   i wanna recompile the kernel to reset some variables "ip multicasting",
   and i have a root access.
   so can you please tell me in steps (detailed) , how to recompile an
   installed kernel of redhat6.0.
Download the kernel source (or have a look in /usr/src/linux)
Read the 'README' in the home directory... 
   thanx
   mourad,
