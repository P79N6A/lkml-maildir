Wait, SUSPEND_SMP again depends on HOTPLUG_CPU, so there
are no issues here in marking cache_remove_dev() __cpuexit
(which effectively simply becomes #ifdef HOTPLUG_CPU) as all
callsites that call out the notifier with CPU_DEAD/FROZEN are also
going to be disabled. [ Ok, looks like using __cpuexit as this kind of
pseudo-#ifdef HOTPLUG_CPU is a standard practice? ]
But modpost will still complain (bogus warning) about calling __exit
from __init (when HOTPLUG_CPU=n) for cacheinfo_cpu_callback()
calling cache_remove_dev(), no?
So I'd guess all the various notifier callback functions in your patch
need to be whitelisted by modpost, as those are __init functions
who can legally reference __exit (when HOTPLUG_CPU=n).
__init_refok can't be used here, so some special whitelisting might
be required, I presume.
