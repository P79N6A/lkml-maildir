Chris does his best to keep Changes uptodate, but when a new version of
something is released, which is necessary for a dev kernel, it might be
a good idea if the package maintainer also provided a patch for Changes.
The latest was with modutils. Yes, I know that people following lkml
should be aware, but obviously lots of folks missed it. I've seen the
problem come up with pcmcia, ppp, util-linux, and modutils.
