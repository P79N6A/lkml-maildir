In this case, it's really a bug that IDE is using a busy wait where it
should be using a sleeping wait.  It's a bug, plain and simple.  To
wrap the bug into "a spec" somehow seems wrong to me, especially when
it would be far better to report the problem as a bug.
Sure, specs make suit-wearing people happy, but that doesn't mean that
they're appropriate as a bug reporting method. 8)
