For patch the same kernel version is necessary ... means if the patch
is for 2.6.10-mm2 then you must have that kernel version .... means
first get 2.6.10 and then get mm2 patch for it .... apply patch to the
kernel and then apply patch for kgdb-2.6.10-mm2
mm2 patch you can get from kernel.org  .........
for applying patch do :
1) extract the kernel source to /usr/src/ directory then do cd to that
directory
2) run in kernel directorty  ....... (don't extract the patch file
from bz2 file)
            bzip2 -dc <patch_file_name> < patch -p1
the above command should succeed and have to show you patching file
msgs only ... don't show hunk or ask you something .... if its
happening then you patch and kernel are not syncronized and patch
wqon't be successful
3) then run the kgdb-2.6.10-mm2 patch like the above command in the
kernel directory ...
Then recompile kernel and do select kgdb option from the kernel
configuration menu
I hope this will work ...
