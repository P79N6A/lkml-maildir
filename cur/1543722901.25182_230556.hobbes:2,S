OK, I had a few idle minutes, so I did patch the Japanese comments in arch/v850.
I am not exactly 100% sure I translated it correctly since I have no idea what exactly was that NEC v850 evaluation board, but should be OK (say 95% sure).
Patches just the comments, so code is untouched.
The other thing is that one of the files was encoded (i.e. readable) in iso-2022-jp, the other in euc-jp...
No idea how patch will handle this, I hope it doesn't bother with locale settings, etc.
Attaching as application/octet-stream in a hope for better handling of i18n issues, sorry for the inconvenience.
Here goes the patch:
