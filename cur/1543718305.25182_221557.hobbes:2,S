The patch itself (in both your way and my way) is trivial, so either way
is okey. 
But the changes it bring up is not trivial, the ext2/3 disk layout for
random writes could be changed heavily, though that's the expected way
(and hopefully result in the good direction). We need to benchmark the
random write on ext2/3 to see what the changes bring about.
I will try random writes on some benchmark later today.
