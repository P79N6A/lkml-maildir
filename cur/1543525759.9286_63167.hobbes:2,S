Good morning, Matt,
	Bingo!
	I had been seeing the "Bad Handle" messages from the kernel pcmcia
implementation for a number of kernels now.  Even when I could get the
kernel to compile at all, I'd insert the pcmcia card, ifconfig up the
ne2000 interface, and as soon as I tried to send the first packet the
entire system froze - even keyboard and mouse hung.  But it came back to
life immediately when I ejected the card.
	Your fix, whether it's the "right" one or not, lets me use 2.3.45
with that card successfully, no complaints from dmesg about Bad Handle
anymore.
	One more note - I also needed to use Jan Kasprzak's
"Patch: drivers/pcmcia/cs.c w/o CONFIG_CARDBUS" patch to get it to compile
with my non-cardbus system.
	Many thanks to you both!
	Cheers,
	- Bill
