Subject: [RFC 0/3] non-resident page tracking
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

These patches implement non-resident page tracking, which is needed
infrastructure for advanced page replacement algorithms like CART
and CLOCK-Pro.
The patches have been tested, but could use some eyeballs.  In
particular, I do not know if the chosen hash function gives a good
spread between the hash buckets.
Note that these patches are not very useful by themselves, I still
need to implement CLOCK-Pro on top of them.  For more information
please see the linux-mm wiki:
