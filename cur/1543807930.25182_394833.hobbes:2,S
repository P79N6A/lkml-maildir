no, just let the tasks be in groups of disjunct spaces
so that they can have shared or private structures for
each of the identified spaces

yes, IMHO that's the way to do it .. Linux-VServer is
moving in this direction for some time now, but we need
to add a special space for context capabilities and
context flags, basically a context struct, similar to
a namespace ...

I'd definitely prefer that, maybe if necessary with a
'new' clone syscall which allows to do a little more
than clone does now, e.g.
 - clone into container/context/guest
 - set space initializations and limits, etc ...

doesn't make sense for the creation, but a syscall
for moving between and management of spaces are very
important ...

for the beforementioned permissions and flags, but
you can as well see it as separate 'context' space

the process will be an unique identifier to the 
namespace, but it might not be easy to use it, so
IMHO it might at least make sense to ...

have an unique identifier for the context space so
that somebody can cherry pick namespaces from there
(in this case, the context space would hold references
to the other namespaces which are the ones used by
new tasks created into a context, basically a template
for them)

extensible and with keeping hierarchical structures 
in mind .. would be bad if we could not do sub-contexts
without a complete rewrite

depends on the resource, but limits have to go to the
context structure, so that they apply for the entire
context space, not just for a task

well, we have to be careful with the complexity ...
keep things like refcounting and 'magic' on clone
simple, for the default case ...

a flat implementation will work for a hierarchical
design if certain things are handled properly, just
think resource management for sub-contexts and 
changes in the parent's limits ...

keep up the good work!
