What is the policy w.r.t broken DSDTs and the ACPI subsystem?
Specifically, which of these two options is right:
1- Provide a non-buggy DSDT to the kernel
2- Make the ACPI subsystem tolerant of the bugs
The option 3, have all biosen over the world fixed is a nice fantasy,
but nothing else.
If 1, we need to put a mechanism for that in the official kernel.
If 2, I'll start working on patches to make the laptop I play with
work as-is.
So, which it is?
  OG.
