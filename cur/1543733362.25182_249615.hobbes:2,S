First of all, only the interface has to be in the kernel.  I haven't
heard anyone suggest otherwise.
Second, there are quite a few things which I might want to do, which can
be done with this interface and without patching programs, but would
require massive patches to userspace.  There have been numerous examples.
There are some things which can't be solved without patching.  Version
control is one such thing.  But then there can be more generic patches
- -- as soon as the transaction API is done, you only have to patch apps
to use that, and have a version control reiser4 plugin.

We already have such a framework -- it's called "VFS".
