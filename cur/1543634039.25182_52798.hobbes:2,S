I agree that it probably should become a softirq.  However, in its current
state, I'm not sure it would gain any advantage from becoming a softirq.
I think it would take someone with far more understanding of the SCSI
layer than I have to do this work properly.  My current motivation is to
eradicate bottom halves rather than to improve scsi.
If someone's maintaining a TODO list for the scsi subsystem, please include:
 * Convert scsi_bottom_half_handler to a softirq.
as one of the entries.
