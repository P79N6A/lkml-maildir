If you run a single mingetty and bash session, you need no swap.
If you run four 1GB processes concurrently, I would use ~5-6G of swap to be on
the safe side.
Swap is very cheap, even if measured in gigabytes. Go with the sum of the
largest process foot-prints you can imagine running on your system, and then
add some. Be generous.  It's not like unused swap space is going to slow the
system down - it's a nice extra little safety to have.   It's beyond me why
anyone would run a system with marginal swap.
On a compile box here with 392 MB physical, I have 900 MB swap. This
accomodates multiple concurrent 100-300 MB compile jobs.   Never had a problem.
Oh, and I didn't have to change my swap setup between 2.2 and 2.4.
