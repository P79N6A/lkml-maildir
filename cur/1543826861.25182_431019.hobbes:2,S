On ppc it should not be that difficult to even modify the exception entry 
code. Instead of calling do_IRQ use do_early_IRQ and only install the real 
handler later.

I guess that's even deadly on most platforms.

Only those archs that want to delay interrupt initialization and they at 
least have to provide minimal support to survive enabled interrupts.
init_IRQ() stays the same for all other archs and we add another hook to 
allow the delayed initializtion.

If you want to have full services, then irqs are part of it. :)
