Looking at it again - accessing SRAT currently relies on the 
direct mapping already. Untangling that would be possible,
but require an bt_ioremap which would also add lots of code.
Ok I retract that objection. I guess your way is better
for now.
In addition to the __cpuinit comment
+if (after_bootmem) spin_unlock(&init_mm.page_table_lock);
Conditional locking is evil. spinlocking in the boot
case should just work too I think.
The EXPORTs should be probably EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.
With these changes it would look ok for me.
