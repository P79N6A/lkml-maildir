Good point.
The tulip driver already did this exact cleanup for similar reasons, and
the 8390-based designs certainly have a lot more reason to do the same: it
would probably be a rather nice idea to just separate out the 8390-based
stuff into it's own subdirectory.

I don't want to have the config entries spread around the system: I would
definitely prefer to have Config.in follow the drivers into the
subdirectory. I don't think the current drivers/net/Config.in is all that
wonderful, I don't see why we couldn't just re-organize a bit.
You don't have to make it a sub-menu, and it shouldn't have a question
like "Do you want support for 8390-based cards". The main drivers/net
Config.in file can just directly source the 8390/Config.in file - it
implies re-ordering the entries, nothing more.
The current network driver ordering isn't all that logical anyway: it
does make sense, but not THAT much sense - it's ordered partly
alphabetically, but more according to other criteria (3com vs SMC vs ISA
vs pocket adapters), so..
But this is probably something that is not worth doing unless the people
really maintaining the drivers (you and who else) _really_ think it would
help. Let's not make changes just for changes sake.
