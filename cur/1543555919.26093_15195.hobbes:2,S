Actually, it would have been clearer with:
  grep -r '#define DEBUG' * | grep -v DEBUG_ | less
Given how hard it was to convice Linus to add his coding style guide
to the documentation, as he won't demand conformance, I doubt if there
will be easy getting people to conform to a standard use of DEBUG :(
I'll settle for fixing kernel.h though, and perhaps adding "use of
DEBUG" to the guidelines.
