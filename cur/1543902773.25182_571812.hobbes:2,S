Here are the updates:
  [1] ps3disk: use correct bio vector size
  [2] ps3disk: updates after final review
  [3] ps3rom: updates after final review
  [4] ps3flash: updates after final review
The first one is the bugfix for O_DIRECT, the other 3 patches are the updates
in response to your review.
Thanks for integrating (and forwarding to Linus)!
