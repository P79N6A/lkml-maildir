Not really.  I believe sandisk has wear leveling on the 201 series CF
cards and on their new generation CF/SD for sure they have it (and
unfortunately for us they discontinued industrial temperature in the new
line so we have had to look elsewhere for CF cards).
Unfortunately a lot of what is sold to consumers at retail is cheap
crap. :)
