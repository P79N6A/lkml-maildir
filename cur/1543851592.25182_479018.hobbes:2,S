Looks like acpi is sending a BUS_CHECK notification to acpiphp on the 
PCI Root Bridge whenever the lid opens up.
There is a bug here in that acpiphp shouldn't even be used on the X60 -
it has no hotpluggable slots.  This problem only occurs when acpiphp is
built in, as when a module it just doesn't load.  It appears to not clean
up after itself properly when it finds no ejectable slots and leaves the
acpi notifier installed for the PCI Root Bridge.  The message is printing
"cannot get bridge info" because it partially cleaned some stuff up (without
actually removing the notifier).  I'll put this bug into bugzilla since
I won't have time to fix right away:

Feel free to add yourself to the CC list if you are interested in being
notified when it is fixed.
