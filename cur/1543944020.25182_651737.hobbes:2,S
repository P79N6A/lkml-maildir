Thought someone replied to this, 
Basically graphics drivers don't use DMA apis for translation at the
moment, hence when we turn on translation we will get faults since IOMMU
would not be able to translate. 
The workaround used to do two things.
1. IF this is dedicated DMAR for igfx, then we just disable the iommu
2. if this is pcie graphics, we provide a 1-1 so we can avoid those
faults.
Sometimes you get those faults for usb devices if the RMRR is not set
correctly by BIOS. An easy workaround is if you disable legacy mode in
bios those should disappear.
