Following are three patches doing just thus.  They are against bk TOT
with Bart's IDE tree pulled in.

They should fork the values they need then, they are not kernel
specific but come from some nightmarish specification :)
About the following patches:
      The first patch adds missing ATA_CMD_* values which the legacy
      code will need.
      The second patch updates the legacy code (and a couple of
      stragglers) to use the new ATA_CMD_* tokens.
      The third patch removes the (then) redundant cruft from hdreg.h.
