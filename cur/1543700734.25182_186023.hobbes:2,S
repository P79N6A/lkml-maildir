Switching internals to ramfs won't be enough, though.  There are problems
with devfs API that can't be solved by work on internals - lifetime rules
for devfs nodes make no sense.  Take a look at the insertion/removal
primitives and think of the lifetime rules they create for directories and
user-created nodes.  _That_ is independent from the way you implement
the internals (and sanitized version of the interface won't fit into
use of ramfs, BTW).
