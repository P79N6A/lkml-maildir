31k links to a file isn't really an issue, I really doubt anyone out
there is doing something like that.
31k links on a directory is a bigger problem, since each subdir is a
link.  The good news is that reiserfs already works around this by
setting the link count to 1 and doing other checks to make sure a
directory really is empty.
My point isn't that we should not change the link max, it is that
changing the link max is not sufficient.  Portability to sparc doesn't
matter one bit if it means breaking existing i386 users.  Our disk
format has link counts > 32k, so any reiserfs fixes for this need to
expect those larger values on disk and play nicely with them.
