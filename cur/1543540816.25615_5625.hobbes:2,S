test6-pre2, x86, UP, gcc 2.7.2.3.
I'm getting a 100% reproducible assertion failure at balloc.c:558:
                 * way it could happen, thus the BUG().
                 */
                if (*prealloc_count)
                        BUG();
                *prealloc_count = 0;
                *prealloc_block = next_block;
                /* Writer: end */
This is happening when running mmap002.  I've put a gdb backtrace up at
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/ext2.txt
Will test patches.
