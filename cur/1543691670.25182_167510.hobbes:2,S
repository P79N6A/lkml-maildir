The delay should be 8 ISA clocks. While you can easily fix inb_p and
outb_p you also need to fix up the udelay() code since if you stick 
a BUG() check in udelay you'll find it gets used before the clock is
initialized even now, let alone with inb_p relying on it. But that
itself is quite fixable too.
(one part of the problem of course is you need inb_p/outb_p to drive
the timer chip on some x86 boards in order to calibrate the udelay
timer)

Not all systems do - we had breakages from both the keyboard controller
and the timer chips even on some modern boards when this got messed up.
