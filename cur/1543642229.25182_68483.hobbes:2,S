Well the TODO was to worry about the (very) incorrect reporting of
mapping occupancy.  mmap(1G file), touch one byte of it (or none)
and the thing will report 1G?
We figured that per-vma rss accounting would be easy and would fix
it, then we remembered that vma's can be split into two, which
screwed that plan most royally.
Maybe when a VMA is split, we set the new VMA to have an rss of zero,
and keep on doing the accounting.  That way, the sum-of-vmas is
still correct even though the individual ones are wildly wrong??
