Never as in:  "it wont work due to hardware/ATA limitation"
or
Never as in:  "it will cause your kernel to Oops"?

I'm using 2.2.16 right now, which I avoided due to other Oopses
that I didn't report before (because I was using 3rd party
modules), but I'm using clean 2.2.16 right now.  I can't afford
the Oops this second, but I will try it out either tonight before
bed, or tomorrow sometime.
Thanks for the response on this.
Alan, if this is a simple fix, is there a chance to get it into
2.2.17?  I'm afraid that someone with cdrom mount access might
Oops my machine when I happen to be blanking an RW...  For now
I've disabled the cdrom group.
TIA
