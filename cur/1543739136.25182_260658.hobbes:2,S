I'm one of the people who I suspect is _most_ likely to compile their
own kernel, and yet _still_ the majority of my boxen are running distro
kernels. It seemed like a relevant enough observation to me, in response
to your bizarre claim that 'most people compile kernel and modules on
the same machine'.

Because it didn't seem relevant. You joined a thread about module
signing asking "how to you want to win the whole game?" and saying "I'm
missing how this does fit into the big picture". Since I was only
discussing the technical details of _how_ we sign modules, I wasn't
really interested in such questions. 
If you _really_ need an answer then yes, I accept that module signing
won't achieve world peace all by itself. There, are you happy now? :)
