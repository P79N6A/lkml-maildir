I had modules which were compiled with another kernel version string
(same kernel though).
In 2.4, you could do a force in the modules.conf files or in the insmod
command line.
The current insmod doesn't have a force option.
Modprobe CAN force, but the modules has to be in the modules tree (i.e.
not arbitrary places on the 
file system)
Is there a way to force load a module at an arbitrary location?
This is very handy for development (not production).
