Well, if you are a kernel developer, and you write the driver for them,
thats exactly how it will be!  They are fairly open.  They just want Linux
support for their fine product.  Any of you who write the code can determine
the best form that support should take.  Oh, and it can do 8.8Mbps.  As for
compatibility, you'd have to ask them.  I'm sure foxjang@hallyeo.com will
contact you with details.
