Can you check which IO scheduler the drives are using, try different
schedulers, and see if it makes a different.
     grep . /sys/block/*/queue/scheduler
will show you (the one in [brackets] is active). 
Then just echo a new value out to each file.
I've had one report that [anticipatory] causes this problem and [cfq]
removes it.  Could you confirm that?
Thanks,
