Ok, updated the bios (using freedos virtual boot floppy provided
by memdisk from syslinux), and... now it all works correctly!
I was definitely blaming linux for the regression - obviously,
as "before-kernel" worked, while "current-kernel" does not
anymore.  But the problem seems to be due to some bios buglet.
Oh well... ;)
