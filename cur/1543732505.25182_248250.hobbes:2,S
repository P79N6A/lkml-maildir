I think (from our off-list discussions) that we really need the signal.
Agreed?
I do think that defining the signal to specific values makes sense, e.g.
KEVENT_ADD, KEVENT_REMOVE, KEVENT_MOUNTED, etc.  We could also send the
attribute as a string.
To get around the hotplug issue that would occur without 'enum kevent',
as we discussed, we could have a "hotplug_added" signal or whatever.
Nothing wrong with that.
Cool or not?
