I'm having some trouble with 2.6.15-rc1:
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 640k freed
Bad page state at free_hot_cold_page (in process 'init', page 108a24a0)
flags:0x00000400 mapping:00000000 mapcount:0 count:0
Backtrace:

This is on a parisc system, though a very similar tree boots fine on a
different machine.  The machine which produces this message is a K460
which uses the Mux serial driver.  As far as I can tell, the only call
to free_hot_cold_page() in uart_shutdown() is to free info->xmit.buf
which seems to be always filled by a call to get_zeroed_page().
This problem doesn't show with 2.6.14.  I can give access to this
machine to anyone who wants to do some debugging.  It has remote power
capabilities ;-)
