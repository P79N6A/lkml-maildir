I posted the original patch series back here:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119083320718236&w=2
- I now have performance measurements.  It gains us about 0.4% on 'a
  well-known OLTP benchmark'.
- I've addressed Dave/Roland's concerns about patch 3/4 being too big;
  it's now patches 5/7 and 6/7 of this series.
- I've run checkpatch.pl over the file, and fixed all the warnings/errors
  it reported.
- And I've updated it to 2.6.24-rc4.
Patches also available from:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/willy/misc.git;a=shortlog;h=dmapool
I'll send all seven as a followup to this mail.
