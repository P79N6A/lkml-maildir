Ok, you've found me out.  I'm too dumb to solve this problem, sorry.
So please send me your patch to implement this and we will take it from
there.

Hahaha, no way is it "deterministic"...

Not at all.  Again, for the last time, use /etc/dev.d to handle such
issues.  That will work if the device is found during system init time
(when the init scripts are running) or later when the system has been
running for 42 days and a new device is plugged in.

It is very interesting for me.  Hence my /sbin/hotplug and udev and
/etc/dev.d development effort to solve real problems that users have
reported needing solved.

I must be missing some work that I need to do to my systems when I
prepare a new one.  For some reason I don't spend any time, other than
deciding on where to mount a specific device that might possibly be
plugged in some time in the future.

Sure, that's what initramfs/initrd is for.  See the Gentoo and SuSE boot
processes for examples of how to add udev and modprobe together to get a
working system for a huge range of different platforms.

Yes, the usb-storage root issue is a problem.  Delaying for it is one
simple solution, I don't really have another one at the moment as I
haven't spent any time trying to get it to work (much to some people's
grumblings at me, but I don't have a box with a BIOS that can boot from
a USB device...)  
After root is mounted is the real issue, which /etc/dev.d solves.
Good luck,
