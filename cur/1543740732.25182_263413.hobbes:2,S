Hmm...I've got a buddy doing a Master's in codesign, where you literally design 
the chip and the software to run on it at the same time, so you can simulate 
them both at the same time and optimise which bits you do in hardware and which 
in software.
Seems to me that chip design and software programming (at least for low-level 
high-performance stuff) are tightly intertwined.
Of course there's the other side of things where you write in prolog or lisp and 
are totally abstracted from the hardware--but I don't see too many people 
writing e.g. graphics drivers in those languages.
