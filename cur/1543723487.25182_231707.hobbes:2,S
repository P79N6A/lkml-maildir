Only if the processor is crippled enough that mixing jump tables and
constant pools in the same pages as code is considered reasonable.
Anyway, that's a strawman -- it's the toolchain's job to get the bits
on the pt_load segments correct.
If the pt_load segment or the mmap prot argument says execute-only,
then you should honor it.
