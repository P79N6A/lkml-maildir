100Hz is not quite fast enough to achieve a quality of flow in multi-media
apps that a human considers smooth. 1000Hz is.

I don't believe its the motherboards. All the way back to the 8086/8088 (and
even the 8080/80805) the Intel processors have hit the snooze button when an
interrupt appears. No modern fast, cached, pipelined processor is going to
like the disturbance caused by an interrupt, but the x86 has always done a
much worse job than is possible.

Ah, a hidden agenda? More seriously, timers on demand would be great, but how
do you achieve portability? Scheduling is such a basic function I think every
modern processor should have an effective fine grained scheduling timer built
in. None do. The timers that exist seem between difficult and impossible to
use in a 100% reliable manner.
