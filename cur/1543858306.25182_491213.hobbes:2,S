Subject: [PATCH] Conditionally check expected_preempt_count in __resched_legal()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Commit 2d7d253548cffdce80f4e03664686e9ccb1b0ed7 ("fix cond_resched() fix")
introduced an 'expected_preempt_count' parameter to __resched_legal() to fix
a bug where it was returning a false negative when called from
cond_resched_lock() and preemption was enabled.
Unfortunately this broke things for when preemption is disabled.
preempt_count() will always return zero, thus failing the check against
any value of expected_preempt_count not equal to zero. cond_resched_lock()
for example, passes an expected_preempt_count value of 1.
So fix the fix for the cond_resched() fix by skipping the check of
preempt_count() against expected_preempt_count when preemption is disabled.
Credit should go to Sunil Mushran for spotting the bug during testing.
