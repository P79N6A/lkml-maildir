The reason I suggested it was not technical, but "marketing". The only
reason compression has not been in the kernel has been because it has
been deemed bad public relations. There exists the obvious possibility
that failures in a compressed ext2 would have been attributed by the
naive user to failures in "the linux file system", sullying the good
reputation of the aforementioned entity. I buy that public relations
argument.

Failure - with any sort of message or not - is a no no anyway. It's the
bad press from naive users that manage to fsck up that is the problem.
Or from sophisticated ones that want to pretend that there is a problem.

Yes, but I think the latter is the right marketing decision.  And I am
sick of patching e2fsck. I have patches for e2compr, patches for ACLs,
patches for I don't know what. It's tough to keep them all working
together. Sometimes I can't and I have to beg the maintainers of the
patches to just _stop it_ or at least use the same version of e2fsck.
:-) Please help keep these issues separate, where they belong. There
isn't enough room in e2fsck for all the possible variants of e2fs.
