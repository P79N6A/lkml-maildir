This is the problem.  Win95/Win98/WinNT has to be rebooted a dozen times
just to install a new software package or piece of hardware.  And everyone
gets used to the idea that changing anything (dial-up networking, etc)
means a "you must now reboot windows for your changes to take effect."
Unix/Linux isn't like that...
