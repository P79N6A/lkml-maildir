    I wonder if I may count on any feedback on this -- asking linux-pci now...
    The issue is as follows: with my patch pci_{request|release}_regions() may 
be called with CONFIG_PCI=n (probably, this never has been a issue before) but 
<linux/pci.h> don't have them declared in this case -- unlike 
pci_enable_device() which is just empty for CONFIG_PCI=n.
    Now, what kind of approach do I take:
- a "fair one", so that pci_{request|release}_regions() get "balanced"
   declarations in the header like pci_enable_device();
- a "local one" (and even saving non-PCI kernel from needless bloat), i.e.
   #ifdef out functions that are only meaningful with CONFIG_PCI=y)?
    I'm leaning to the second now...
