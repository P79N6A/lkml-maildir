Subject: [PATCH] (0/7) Finish moving NUMA-Q into subarch, cleanup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

oops --- the original of this went to Linus, but not LKML, sorry.
------------------------------------
The following sequence of patches finishes the move of NUMA-Q into
subarch, and cleans up some of the mess I made when I put it in
originally. clustered_apic_mode, CONFIG_CLUSTERED_APIC and smpboot.h
all die by the end of the sequence.
There are some topology changes in here, which are needed as a precursor
to the cpu<->apicid mapping cleanups, which are needed to make Summit work.
I've tried hard to break everything out into small readable chunks, and
it's designed to be a complete no-op on standard machines.
Tested on UP, standard SMP, Crusader, NUMA-Q, and Summit (x440).
Test-compiled on UP+IO/APIC. No new compiler warnings are introduced.
Removes more lines of code than it adds, according to diffstat.
This is the last of the stuff for moving NUMA-Q into subarch.
Please apply,
Thanks,
Martin.
