Why is that?  I thought, if I hold a spinlock (or rw_lock in my case)
I only block other threads that try to get that same lock.  With
rcu_read_lock() I disable preemption which I thought affects more
(all) other parts of the kernel.

Depends on how many and what types of sockets are opened and which
packets they want to receive.  The code is part of a new protocol
family implementation for CAN (controller area network), which you can
see at belios.de, project name socket-can.  It implements several
types of PF_CAN sockets, which register for packets of certain CAN
IDs, which are then lightly processed (filtered) and eventually
delivered into a queue using sock_queue_rcv_skb().  Usually, the list
has one receiver per open PF_CAN sockets.  Typical usage here has
shown list lengths of 30-100 entries, i.e. 30-100 packets delivered
with sock_queue_rcv_skb().  But it all depends on what the user space
does, how many PF_CAN sockets are opened by all processes.
Is that value of "quite long" also "too long" for doing an
rcu_read_lock()?
urs
BTW, while implementing PF_CAN and reading kernel code and
documentation I often run into questions on details like this which
I'd like answered to get a better understanding of kernel internals,
sometimes not directly related to some concrete implementation
problem.  Is LKML the right place for these questions?
