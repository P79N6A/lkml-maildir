I guess you really mean 7-bit device address? That's what I2C/SMBus uses.

You're mostly right. In fact, the documentation you pointed us to is
about the I2C protocol itself, not the kernel implementation. In the
kernel, we have helper functions for all the SMBus commands (SMBus is a
subset of I2C) and two very common non-SMBus transactions (1-byte
address block read, and 1-byte address block write). Other transactions
can still be done, but are almost never implemented in SMBus masters, so
they have no helper functions. You have to use the lower-level i2c
access interface.

You should be able to go with what the core offers. The transaction you
want to do is not an SMBus transaction, so you have to go with the i2c
access functions: i2c_transfer, i2c_master_send and i2c_master_recv. In
your case, i2c_master_send is the best choice.
Or you can use a trick and go with i2c_smbus_write_i2c_block_data after
all. The I2C protocol doesn't differenciate between register addresses
and written data, it's purely a matter of convention with the addressed
chip. So, you can see your transaction not as two register address bytes
followed by two data bytes, but as one register address byte followed by
three data bytes. It's really the same on the wire, and this fits well
in i2c_smbus_write_i2c_block_data.
I would go with i2c_master_send, unless you need some kind of SMBus
master compatibility (many SMBus masters implement I2C-like block
transfers). May I ask what i2c adapter driver you are using to talk to
your AD7142 chip?
