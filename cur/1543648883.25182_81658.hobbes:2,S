You mean how the VIC boots?  Certainly.  Referring to the architecture in
http://www.hansenpartnership.com/voyager/L5arch.html
The VIC is basically a set of 8258 dyads (and voyager has up to 8 of them).  
The boot CPU can send a cross processor interrupt (CPI) to any VIC connected 
CPU.  However, the boot CPU can only modify its own VIC 8258 dyad, so theres a 
masquerade register that temporarily globally drives the VIC processor ID 
lines so that the boot CPU can lower the interrupt mask in a different VIC.
However, each CPU card has only one or two VIC connections, so booting the 
Quad cards is a sort of one-two trick: you VIC boot the VIC connected CPU 
(called the extended CPU) and then it QIC (Quad interrupt controller) boots 
the remaining CPUs.  The QIC works using a cache line interference mechanism 
(so writes to a particular part of memory trigger the CPI).  However, only 
CPUs local to the Quad can masquerade as each other to lower the QIC interrupt 
mask.

Well technically, there's the boot time GDT separation (make boot GDT smaller 
and simpler than the runtime) which affects all x86.
There's also the TSC timer problem which is fixed in the voyager tree, but 
which is still being discussed on lkml.  Without turning off the TSC entirely 
clock jitter is so bad in 2.4.43 that it causes hangs in the softirq code (I 
have four CPUs at 66Mhz and 4 at 166Mhz).
