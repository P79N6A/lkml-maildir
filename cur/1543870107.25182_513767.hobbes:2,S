Subject: [PATCH] export device_rename
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In wireless we'd like to allow renaming of the phy devices we surface in
sysfs. The base wireless code, however, can be built modular and thus we
need device_rename exported.

Is this acceptable? For testing reasons we want the cfg80211 code
buildable as a module.
