Ugh ... "character devices" ... that's a pretty wide statement...
there's lots of those and very different one from the other...
Any sane device-driver will have to cope with being suspended in a
"live" system. I've demonstrated multiple times in the past why this is
necessary anyway, for things like dynamic power management, among
others.
The whole freezer thing is a hack job to avoid fixing drivers that need
fixing. Unfortunately, I believe in that area, it's simply not
sustainable. Besides, getting drivers to behave properly isn't very hard
in most cases.
