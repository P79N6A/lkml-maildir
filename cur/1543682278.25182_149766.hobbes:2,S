To Whom it May Concern:
I experienced a menuconfig crash and I am following the notication 
instructions of the error message (pasted below).  At the time of the 
crash, I was in the sound configuration section and was entering the 
ALSA configuration subsection. The kernel I was trying to configure was 
a Mandrake 2.4.21 kernel: linux-2.4.21-0.18mdk.
Here is the error message:
-------------BEGINNING OF PASTED MATERIAL------------------------------
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: line 832: MCmenu73: command not found
 Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
 send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
 Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
 which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
 make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
------------END OF PASTED MATERIAL----------------------------------------
The system I was trying to configure this kernel on was an old 200 MHz 
Pentium MMX with 64 MB of RAM (so old that it had PCI and USB, but no 
AGP; the video card was plugged into a PCI slot).
