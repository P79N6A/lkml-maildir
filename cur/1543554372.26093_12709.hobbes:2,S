Agreed that is a bit of a risk.  Mostly you just have to handle
the chipset of the boards and there are a finite number of them.
Only time will tell if this is truly feasible.  I think it is certainly
work a try.  
And I don't have to handle every single one just all of the ones
I need it to run on :)
With the my kexec patch I'm just getting the infrastructure ready, and that
is functionality that can be used independently of linuxBIOS.  If
booting linux from linux would help with what you are doing I love to
work together on that.
