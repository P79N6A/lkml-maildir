Well, no.  Consider a continuously-running application which modifies its
data store via MAP_SHARED+msync(MS_ASYNC).  If the msync() immediately
started I/O, the disk would be seeking all over the place all the time.  The
queue merging and timer-based unplugging would help here, but it won't be
as good as a big, infrequent ascending-file-offset pdflush pass.
Secondly, consider the behaviour of the above application if it is modifying
the same page relatively frequently (quite likely).  If MS_ASYNC starts I/O
immediately, that page will get written 10, 100 or 1000 times per second. 
If MS_ASYNC leaves it to pdflush, that page gets written once per 30
seconds, so we do far much less I/O.
We just don't know.  It's better to leave it up to the application designer
rather than lumping too many operations into the one syscall.
