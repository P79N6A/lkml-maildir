True, if copy_from_user fails it just bails out, I didn't see anything 
really bad that could happen from that, but I'm an idiot, looking at it 
again I guess it could probably mess up tape->bh pretty bad.
Guess I need to go back and look at this in greater detail.
Thank you for looking at it.

As I noted in the [0/2] mail I don't have hardware to test these patches, 
so they need to be reviewed.
