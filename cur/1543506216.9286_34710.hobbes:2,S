Hey folks - I have a wierd one...
Has something major changed in 2.2.7->2.2.10 ?  
It used to be that I could telnet or POP or whatever to an aliased IP.  I
can't on 2.2.10 now!
Two almost identical machines - one on 2.2.7, one on 2.2.10.  Same ethernet
controller (EEpro 100).  2.2.7 behaves as I expect, 2.2.10 does not!  If I
telnet to the address at eth0:0, I get an immediate response of:
Trying x.x.x.x...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
Putting the hosts inetd in strace and debug, it shows that inetd is not
even being alerted when the connection purportedly fails.
Does anyone have any ideas as to what could be causing this???
