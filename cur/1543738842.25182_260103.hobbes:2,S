Marvell also have drivers for 2.4 and 2.6, but they are under NDA
etc etc, and ignore libata (they also pre-date libata), so if
you have hardware that you _must_ get working; they might be
a useful stopgap.
I'll repeat my eagerness to test anything for the 88SX50xx or 88SX60xx,
regardless of how primitive it is. My benchmarking with the Marvell
driver shows the throughput to be excellent.
