  So you say we write 4-times as much data in ordered mode as in writeback
mode. Hmm, probably possible because we force all the dirty data to disk
when committing a transation in ordered mode (and don't do this in
writeback mode). So if the workload repeatedly dirties the whole DB, we are
going to write the whole DB several times in ordered mode but in writeback
mode we just keep the data in memory all the time. But this is what you
ask for if you mount in ordered mode so I wouldn't consider it a bug.
  I still don't like your hack with per-process journal mode setting but we
could easily do per-file journal mode setting (we already have a flag to do
data journaling for a file) and that would help at least your DB
workload...
