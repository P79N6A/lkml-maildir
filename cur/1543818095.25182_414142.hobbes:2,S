But that hold true for other stuff in include/* also.
The guideline is (my understanding):
- Use .h files only when declarations are shared by more than one .c
  file
- Put the .h file in same dir as the .c files, iff the .c files are all
  in same dir (and include using #include "file.h")
- For bigger subsystems create an include/<subsystem> dir for shared .h
  files (and include using #include <file.h>)
- For smaller subsystems create an include/linux/<subsystem> dir for
  shared .h files (and include using #include <file.h>)
And then we also have:
- For Greg's pci-core keep the shared .h file with the .c files
  (and include using #include "../file.h")
See why this sticks out a bit.
Not that I imply the above guidlines are strictly followed - but thats
the best I have seen.
