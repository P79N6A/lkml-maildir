I can shed some light on this (though I'm far from a PG hacker).
Postgres can use either of two locking methods -- SysV semaphores
(which it tries to avoid, asusming that they'll be too heavy) or
userspace spinlocks (via inline assembler on platforms which support
it).
In the slow path of a spinlock_acquire they busy wait for a few
cycles, and then call schedule with a zero timeout assuming that
it'll basically do the same as a sched_yield() but more portably.
