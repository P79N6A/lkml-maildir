I worry about SPI at the moment because I can't see how it's being used
from just this code.
The worry I have is that it appears to contain an algorithm layer.  Would
this be better as a library for drivers to use, or something like that?
The reason I bring up this point is that my L3 layer is over-complex
for what it does (despite being about 378 lines) because it tried far
too hard to look like the I2C layer - soo much so I'm not happy with
it for mainline.
(I also have some concerns with the amount of NULL pointer checking in
the SPI code...)
