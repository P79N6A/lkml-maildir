One of my questions was why apt-get worked to install the
initramfs-tools, the kernel and some other packages but later hung
while it was building the cache (which clearly it had built already to
install some packages): before the installer offers to install
additional packages, it changes the apt sources, which leads to apt
rebuilding the cache, and here it hangs.
Remember how I said that downloading a file with wget prompts apt to
work again?  Apparently any filesystem access will do (I just ran
find / > /dev/null).  Gordon, can you confirm this?
