Gulp... :-(
Yes, your patch is indeed fine.  I heartily recommend it (for whatever
that is worth).
Your mailer on the other hand....  could use some work.
The latest patch that you mailed out still had only spaces, no tabs.
Nevertheless, I managed to apply it and it seems to work fine, as well
as looking all right.
