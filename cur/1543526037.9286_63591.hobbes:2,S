dropped Linus and Peter from cc as they surely know more about this
stuff than I anyway :)
Basically, no you can't roll your own microcode because nobody knows how
it works. The microcode encoding format is documented but the actual
data bits are just that - bits...
The good reading is section 8.10 of Volume III of Pentium III manual
available for free download from:
         
http://developer.intel.com/design/pentiumii/manuals/243192.htm
I would suggest to read the first volume and then the third using the
second as an instruction reference (which is what it is).

Tigran.
