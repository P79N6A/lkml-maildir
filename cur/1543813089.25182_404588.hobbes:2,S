Wow! Lots of people being c/c here! Since all pertinent guys are at
lkml, I've just removed all those spam, keeping copied just the lists,
and Adrian, who warned me about it.

The option disable_ir is, in fact, a workaround. If this is not needed
anymore, this is a progress ;) Anyway, having an OOPS is really bad. We
should go further to avoid oops on it.
IR on some saa7134 cards are really a trouble. Sometimes, it just
generates lots of weird events, since you are gathering a generic io
port (GPIO) from hardware to generate keypressing. Using the wrong port
may generate troubles at the system, by sending wrong events to input.
With a wrong card, if somebody fixed the IR, it may broke for your
board.

El Cheapo boards are difficult to support. Most of they don't offer an
unique PCI ID. Others are just OEM cards. The same card is selled on
several different markets with different brand names (sometimes with
different GPIO ports and/or tuners).
For you to include it at kernel, you need to discover gpio ports used on
it. There are some wiki pages at 
http://linuxtv.org
 explaining the
process of identifying it using dscaler for m$. Dscaler is a freeware,
and have a small app, called regspy, that enables reading what windoze
is programming at some devices. For more details, please look at:
