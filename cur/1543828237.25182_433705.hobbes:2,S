I'd view this as a kludge.  If one group of tasks is trashing the
performance of another group of tasks the user is forced to use hardware
virtualisation to work around it.
I mean, is this our answer to the updatedb problem?  Instantiate a separate
copy of the kernel just to run updatedb?

Well yes.  Ideally and ultimately.  People have done this, and it's in
production.  We need to see (and work upon) the patches before we can judge
whether we want to do this, and how far we want to go.

Isolation.  To prevent one group of processes from damaging the performance
of other groups, by providing manageability of the resource consumption of
each group.  There are plenty of applications of this, not just
server-consolidation-via-server-virtualisation.
