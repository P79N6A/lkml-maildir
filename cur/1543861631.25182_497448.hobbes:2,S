What's wrong with having _several_ vendors contributing hardware to
kernel.org? Hopefully HP is providing the hardware not just for the
fame but also because they know how much it is needed and they have an
interest in the Linux kernel development going well and smoothly.
HP should actually enjoy the cost being shared with another company. Or
was the HP hardware given in exhange of the promess that HP would be
the only hardware provider of kernel.org and that this would be loudly
advertised? I sure hope not, and I can't believe we're willing to wait
for half a year just to let HP provide the hardware if another vendor
is also willing to provide it and would be faster.
It's free software we're doing here, it should be natural to accept the
help of anyone who wants to help, and to share the costs where possible.
