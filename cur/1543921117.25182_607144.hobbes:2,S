Generally speaking, if such cache trashing is an issue, why don't we
make sure that each task struct member is declared in this structure
following its access frequency ? (except for #ifdef blocks, which should
stay together) It could then statistically save a lot of cachelines.
Or is it already the case ? It doesn't look like it when I see:
struct list_head ptrace_list;
Just beside the 
struct mm_struct *mm, *active_mm;
pointers.
