Agreed.

We could handle these guys by selling/donating commercial seats.
But while we started out with the goal of helping the Linux effort,
specifically Linus, other open source projects have gotten past
the license and found value in the product: mysql, xaraya, xen, etc.
Whatever we do we can't do anything which would disrupt their efforts,
that's not reasonable.

Would the tarball + patch server suffice for you?  We could make a
ChangeSet file which had bk changes -v output in it and that would 
give you a fairly useful set of version information.  For those who
don't know, bk changes -v is output in time sorted order of changesets
with the changeset comments then each file's comments like the output
below.  
This server wouldn't be much use for someone trying to track down the
source of a bug, you'd really need the BK2CVS tree for that or a BK
tree.  In some ways, the BK2CVS tree is far nicer because you can do
binary search on it, but as Roman/Pavel/et al have pointed out sometimes
the commits in the CVS tree are too coarse if the cset you want is a
merge of 20 changesets on a branch.  In that case you want the BK tree.
But for people trying to easily track the head the tarball server might
be just the ticket.  Erik (codepoet guy) would probably love it (right?).
If it would help people feel better about us and/or make their lives easier
we can set up that server for all the repos on bkbits.net.  I suspect
that it would help at least some people out there.
