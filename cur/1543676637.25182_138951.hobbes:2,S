Hi,
   When is is appropriate to use spinlocks in the kernel,
how are they implemented (e.g. syntax, function names) and
can anyone think of a good area of the kernel for me to look 
at, that uses them?
Thanks again for any help.
                   Lars.
Thanks double-ly if you give code examples... :-)
