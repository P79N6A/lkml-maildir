For ripping CDs I'd prefer if the application could control retries
and not default to what the CD player prefers.
I have a CD, KLF -- Ultra Rare Tracks, and unfortunately someone I
borrowed it to managed to literally stomp on it, so the record has a
lot of scratches.  I would very much like to rip as much as possible
of this CD so that I can at least listen to part of it, but every time
I have tried the CD player just gets stuck in an endless retry loop.
The same thing happens when trying to rip a "copy controlled" CD,
which is also pretty irritating since this means that I can't rip my
Teddybears Stockholm CD and put the songs on my iPod.
