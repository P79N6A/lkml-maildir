Subject: [PATCH] pci: Omit error message for benign allocation failure
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
On a system with PCI-to-PCI bridges, following errors are observed:
PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #8:100000@d8200000 for 0000:02:00.0
PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #6:10000@0 for 0000:03:01.0
'#6' is for expansion ROM and '#8' for the bridge where the device
with the expansion ROM is connected.
But I think the failure is benign because the allocation is
not necessary for these resources.
The allocation failure message is informative when the failure
is really a problem and needs a diagnosis.
However, if the resource is expansion ROMs, the message is just
confusing.
This patch omits the error message if the resource is an expansion
ROM or a bridge.
Thanks,
