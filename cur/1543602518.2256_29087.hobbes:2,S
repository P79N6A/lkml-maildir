I'm having big problems with booting on this motherboard.
It is a dual motherboard with 2x Intel P3 866Mhz cpus
Asus CUV 266-D  Bios rev. 1003
I have tried to boot with the following kernels:
2.4.0 (SuSE 7.1 Install CD)
2.4.4? (SuSE 7.2 Install CD)
2.4.10 Custom compiled with SMP, but no extra ACPI or APM
2.4.0 boots and works for a while, but installation always fails..
It just stops, and never gives any error messages.
2.4.4 boots and works for a while, but installation always fails..
It most often stops, but some times it complains about some HDD
error (too fast for me to see what it actually says) then reboots.
2.4.10 boots, but only with MPS 1.1, and most of the bios in safety mode.
When it gets to checking the HDD it fails and mounts it read-only.
I can see ACPI errors occuring while booting, but they run along too fast
for me to fine-read.. (any way to pause/delay it?)
Something about unexpected or unknown ACPI-IO *i think*
I have tried to change the HDD with another one, and have confirmed
that both are working in another comp. (Western Digital WD200)
I'll type _some_ of what lspci outputs, please forgive any spellings and
shorts:

There are two Intel Dual server NIC's in the box..  meaning each card has
1x DEC21152, and 2x Intel82557 on them.
If you need any other info, please let me know.
Please give me feedback on what this might be, and how this can be solved.
