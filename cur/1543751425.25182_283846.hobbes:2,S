alloc_pages(ZONE_NORMAL) is used to get memory area for the mini kernel
in "4MB unit"(i386). So the pages is never under 1M.
(for x86_64, alloc_bootmem is used to reserve the memory for the mini
 kernel. alloc_pages does not guarantee under 4GB!!)

yes. kmalloc is used to get kimage struct. Indeed it is more safe to
put such structues in the reserved area (and write protected).
Thank you for your indication.
