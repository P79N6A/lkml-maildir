To be precise, mii-tool is deprecated, in favor of ethtool.  There are 
other things that use mii capabilities.  Bonding uses miimon, but the 
arp monitor is an alternative, and I don't think there's much overlap 
between workloads where people care about bonding and workloads people 
run on an Asus M2V motherboard, so I'm not sure there's much 
justification to bother supporting the feature, except completeness. 
Thus my question to netdev:
Would anyone care if we removed MII support from an experimental driver 
for a chip that is only known to ship on non-OEM desktop boards?
