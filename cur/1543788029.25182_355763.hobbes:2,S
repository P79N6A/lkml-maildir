It's mine too, but I hadn't seen the need to perpetuate this stupid

Working on other things?  It's not like scsi core is the only armpit
the kernel has.

But people have been working on improving scsi core for many years.  The
transport classes have a copyright daate of 2003 on them, for example.

Things take time.  Even standards committees.

That's why we still need each driver to have a scsi host template.  That
way each driver can do what it needs to do.  For MPT, that's mostly 'ask
firmware and present the results to sas'.  For other SAS drivers, that's
probably 'call this function in the SAS trransport class that does
everything you want'.
If you like, you can think of it as working around a bug.  Instead of
doing it in the SAS class, we let the driver fix the layering bug.
