I think it's just the way that ifup works.  I'm not entirely sure why
the line appears twice.

Aha.  That works fine.
So here is how to make it fail:
/sbin/modprobe forcedeth; \
/sbin/ip link set dev eth0 up
All subsequent runs of 'ethtool eth0' show:
Settings for eth0:
        Supports Wake-on: g
        Wake-on: d
        Link detected: no
regardless of how long I leave it.
So is this a driver problem or a problem with the way /sbin/ifup
works?
Tim.
