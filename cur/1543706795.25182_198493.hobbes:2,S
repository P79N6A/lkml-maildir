With regards to the initrd.txt hint. (2.4.x kernels)
It does not work with the     "  root=/dev/rd/0   (with devfs) "
unless         { "rd/0",     0x0100 },   is added to the root_dev_names[] 
__initdata array; (init/do_mounts.c)
You need to use "root=/dev/ram0" with or without devfs. (or change 
init/do_mounts.c).  Patches to either code or documentation if you want.
