Yes, we can't just kill tasklist_lock, we should replace it with rcu_read_lock.

Those threads have ->mm == NULL, this loop will not count them. But I think
tasklist_lock can't make any difference for this issue. I am not sure I
understand your concern, it is ok to use this ->mm (current uses it), and
a kernel thread incremented ->mm_count.
