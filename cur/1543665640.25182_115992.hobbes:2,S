Hmm, is there a way to inherit this from arch code?

What on earth? Shouldn't this be done some other way?
I really think 32-bit compatibility should be mostly ignored; userspace
should just be rearranged to understand it's looking at a 64-bit kernel
even when running in a 32-bit userspace.

Hmm, USER_MODE_TESTING can probably just go.

Erm, is this safe? there's a reason _raw_spin_unlock() is used here, for
the CONFIG_PREEMPT stuff basically. It'd look less disturbing if the old
names and semantics were preserved.

DEBUG_LOCKMETER should probably go away for merging.
All in all I'm glad to have this back. It'd be a valuable addition to
CONFIG_PROFILING once things are lined up with Linux conventions.
Despite a little bit of crustiness inherited from before ppl were used
to Linux conventions it's still pretty smooth.
