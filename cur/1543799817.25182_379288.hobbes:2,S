I don't think so. We wait for the controller to leave 'block mode', but
the spec isn't clear if this includes waiting for the busy signal. There
is another bit for explicitly checking the busy bit. I can see if I can
get the bug reporters to try it out.
Doesn't the busy status map directly to the programming state anyhow?

That's what got me thinking that waiting for it to leave programming
state is the way to go.

What seems to be missing?
