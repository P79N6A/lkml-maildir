E.g. situation, only one file struct left for allocation. One CPU goes
into get_empty_filp and before kmem_cache_alloc unlocks file_list,
another CPU gets also into get_empty_filp and locks file_list at the
top and goes on the same path, the end result potentially can be both
will increase nr_files instead of only one. But I don't think it's a
big issue at *present* that could cause any problems ...

Sorry I didn't explain, I thought it's short enough and significantly
faster to understand reading the code then my poor English ;)
