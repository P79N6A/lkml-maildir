?  Rebasing doesn't lose any history ... just read the manual page.  It
also tends to be required operating procedure constructing a patch set
against a moving target

No it's still required.  That was the problem that occurred when ioremap
was switched from cached to uncached.  You were just trigger happy when
I explained the problem and how to fix it.  The ioremap_cached needs a
comment explaining why it has to be cached.

Yes, good catch ... when they go in in different places rebasing doesn't
always catch the updates.

Well, you actually have to say what you want.  A simple git log will
tell you that [VOYAGER] has been the standard form for years.

So if I understand, you want x86 and voyager?

Really nothing should be including asm/acpi.h ... it should be including
linux/acpi.h, which would resolve the issue ... but I didn't understand
why it wanted the asm version in the first place, so I was reluctant to
try fixing it properly in case there was large breakage in
configurations I don't check.  If fixmap.h wants to continue using the
asm version, the ifdef hedging is about the best way: it duplicates what
linux/acpi.h does, if you look (asm/acpi is gated by the same ifdef).

Because you're planning to put non-ACPI symbols in asm/acpi.h?  Since
linux/acpi.h works in the same way, you'll break a lot of other things
if you do that.

They're pretty neutral to my point of view.  They identify the commit
causing the problem and describe the fix.  This is standard changelog
behaviour.  If you identify problem language, I can fix it, but I think
just saying this commit broke and it was fixed by doing that is about as
neutral as you can get.
As I keep explaining, there are two other voyager users, one in Italy
and one in Argentina.  Both institutions with virtually no IT budget
that happened to be stuck with an inventory of the systems.  It might
not be massive, but I bet it's bigger than some other architectures user
bases.

OK, How?
For example: If you want to be involved in SCSI development, you follow
linux-scsi:  every patch that ever makes it into any tree goes over that
list for comment (this includes every patch I do).  If I look at your
x86/apic branch for instance, most of the patches appear to have gone
straight from your fancy into your git tree without ever traversing a
mailing list (or at least not one indexed by google).
If you develop by banging stuff into a git tree as soon as you think of
it, it's a bit hard to participate in that process (I gave up telepathy
in favour of contact sports a while ago).  The best method is, in fact,
to wait until your stuff gets into mainline and then fix it all up,
which, by co-incidence is the way the voyager tree currently operates.

Thanks.
I really would recommend the fix I proposed:  all it does, as I said, is
precisely what linux/acpi.h does.  The problem with trying to include
linux/acpi.h in asm/fixmap.h is that fixmap is an early include and gets
us into all sorts of nasty circular tangles that will be very invasive
to sort out.
