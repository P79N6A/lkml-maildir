FYI, I have a similar setup, and have not encountered this problem. My
setup:
PII-450 (not overclocked :)
SuperMicro P6DBS SMP m/board
128mb SDRAM
Dual-channel Adaptec 2940UW (on board)
on the first channel:
  IBM DDRS-34560D (/, /var, /home, /tmp, swap)
  IBM DGHS09U (first half of a RAID-1 array)
  IBM DDRS-39130W (/usr)
on the second channel:
  TEAC CD-ROM CD-532S
  IBM DGHS09U (second half of RAID-1 arary)
  Seagate STT8000N (4gb tape backup)
uname -a says:
Linux jade 2.2.2 #1 Fri Feb 26 02:06:43 PST 1999 i686 unknown
That's straight from the kernel's mouth. (so to speak)
