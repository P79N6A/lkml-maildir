    I am trying to load linux 2.0.35 on to a DEC Personal Workstation 300i. 
    The load goes fine (I am using S.U.S.E 5.3) but when I finish and try to
    boot from the drive LILO hangs at LI.  I have read a lot about why that
    happens and nothing seems to work.  I have added the disk geometry into
    lilo.conf and reran lilo. I did this in the global section with DISK=
    and HEADS= SECTORS= CYLINDERS=.  When I do this I get L 04 04
    (continuing for ever) and when I have no geometry it hangs at LI.  This
    is a 4 gig Western Digital EIDE drive.  Any advice would be great.  
You do not give lilo.conf, so get generalities only:
1) LILO problems are often user error rather than geometry problems.
2) The less the user says about geometry, the better are the chances
   that all will work.
(Say nothing to fdisk, say nothing to LILO [at most `linear'],
say nothing to the Linux kernel, and save yourself a lot of trouble,
searching for problems where there are none unless created by you.)
When all else fails, read the docs.
