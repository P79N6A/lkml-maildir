Hello all,
<p>I've just rewritten the decoder in the cuecat driver to be a state machine
instead of a flat string parser, which allows the portion of the kernel
driver that deals with scancodes to detect possible barcodes very soon,
buffer the scancodes, squelch them if they really are a barcode or re-inject
them in the kernel if they turn out to be normal keyboard input scancodes.
So now, the console isn't messed up anymore when scanning a barcode.
<p>Also, I replaced my triplet decoding routine by Colin Cross' generic
algorith which is much better and very generic : Colin's code enables the
driver to read just about any type of barcode !
<p>The new driver is available at :

<p>Have fun :)
