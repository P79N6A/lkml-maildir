AFAIU the "memory" tells GCC that this asm has side-effects of changing
arbitrary memory addresses. This in turn prevents GCC from keeping
memory values in registers through the instruction:
"If your assembler instructions access memory in an unpredictable
 fashion, add `memory' to the list of clobbered registers.  This will
 cause GCC to not keep memory values cached in registers across the
 assembler instruction and not optimize stores or loads to that memory.
 You will also want to add the `volatile' keyword if the memory affected
 is not listed in the inputs or outputs of the `asm', as the `memory'
 clobber does not count as a side-effect of the `asm'."
So both volatile and "memory" are required to get true compiler barrier.
