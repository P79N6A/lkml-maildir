You are wrong wrt MAP_PRIVATE semantics. You really need to mmap
MAP_SHARED to get the file updated: [quoting from SUS2]
When the msync() function is called on MAP_PRIVATE mappings, any modified
data will not be written to the underlying object and will not cause such
data to be made visible to other processes. It is unspecified whether data
in MAP_PRIVATE mappings has any permanent storage locations.
