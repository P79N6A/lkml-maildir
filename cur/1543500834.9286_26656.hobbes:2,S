You already can do this for outgoing frames. For incoming frames you do
need to be a bit more careful (as you found out). You can't go around 
re-ordering tcp data once it has hit tcp_rcv, nor any other interface
defined to be "ordered" - ie you can reorder SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_RDM but not
SOCK_SEQPACKET/SOCK_STREAM data.
