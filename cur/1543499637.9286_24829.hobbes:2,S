You ignored the point I'm making. You said that devfs is a solution
looking for a problem. That is incorrect. There are (were) several
problems for which I came up with a solution.
You are entitled to have your opinion on whether devfs is the right
solution or not. However, it's just plain rude to insinuate that I
coded before thinking.
