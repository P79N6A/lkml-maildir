If something does that, it must *only* be in userspace so that we can
easily disable it. It's amazing how many laptops consider that you
don't want any performance when you run off batteries. I've seen a
2GHz laptop falling back to 600 MHz when running on batteries, which
was very inconvenient when the laptop in question was used to go
sniffing gigabit traffic in datacenters... I would even go as far
as to say that my notebook runs lowpower only when it's plugged into
the wall because it's when I'm typing or doing low activity things.
In my opinion, battery != low power, battery == mobility. It's user's
choice which must imply low power, so that must be done with a dedicated
daemon.

Willy
