 Anton Blanchard did some nice benchmarks of this work a while
 ago, and noticed that with one of the features (I think the
 I forget which its in the l-k archives somewhere) there
 seemed to be a noticable performance degradation.
 Of course, this was a dbench test, so how reflective this is

 Maybe Randy Hron can throw it in with the next round of
 kernel tests he does ?
