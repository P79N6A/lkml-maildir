However `man sched_priority' says...
       Processes scheduled with SCHED_OTHER or SCHED_BATCH  must
       be assigned the  static  priority  0. Processes  scheduled
       under  SCHED_FIFO  or SCHED_RR can have a static priority
       in the range 1 to 99. The  system calls
       sched_get_priority_min() and sched_get_priority_max() can
       be used to find out the valid priority range for a
       scheduling policy in a portable way on all POSIX.1-2001
       conforming systems.
and see the kernel/sched.c ...
  int sched_setscheduler(struct task_struct *p, int policy,
                         struct sched_param *param)
  {
          ...
          /*
           * Valid priorities for SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR are
           * 1..MAX_USER_RT_PRIO-1, valid priority for SCHED_NORMAL and
           * SCHED_BATCH is 0.
           */
          if (param->sched_priority < 0 ||
              (p->mm && param->sched_priority > MAX_USER_RT_PRIO-1) ||
              (!p->mm && param->sched_priority > MAX_RT_PRIO-1))
                  return -EINVAL;
          if (is_rt_policy(policy) != (param->sched_priority != 0))
                  return -EINVAL;
          ...
  }
So, if I want to set the rt_prio of a kernel_thread, we can't use this
entry unless set t->prio to 99 directly. I don't know whether we are
allowed to write such code bipassing sched_setscheduler(). In addition,
even if kernel_thread can use this index , I can't understand it's usage.
It can only be used by kernel, but its priority is LOWER than any real
time thread.
If the rule can be changed to the following...
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| index     | usage                                         |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 0         | RT processes are here. Only kernel can use    |
|           | this entry.                                   |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 1 - 99    | RT processes are here. They are in the entry  |
|           | whose index is 99 - sched_priority.           |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 100 - 139 | Ordinally processes are here. They are in the |
|           | entry whose index is (nice+120) +/- 5         |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
... there will be an entry only used by kernel and its priority is HIGHER
than any user process, and I'll get happy :-)
Thanks,
Satoru
