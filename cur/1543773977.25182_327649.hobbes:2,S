This is a curious aspect of the driver model core.  Should failure of a 
driver to bind be considered serious enough to cause device_add to fail?
The current answer is Yes unless the driver's probe routine returns 
-ENODEV or -ENXIO, in which case the failure is not considered serious.
IMO this is a perverse way of doing things.  The existence of a device has 
nothing to do with what driver is bound to it.  Either the device exists 
or it doesn't -- and if it exists, failure to bind a driver shouldn't 
prevent adding the device into sysfs.  Right now, however, it does.
