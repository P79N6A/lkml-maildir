I have compiled both the kernel module and the replacement X server from 
the yesterday's CVS checkout of DRI (but according to "outdated" 
instructions in the Wiki). It made a difference against XFree86 4.4.0 + 
in-kernel radeon.ko.
The difference is that, instead of just hanging, after several minutes 
of run time applications (e.g. "really slick screensavers") print:
drmRadeonIrqWait: -16
and exit with status 1.
After that, 2D works, but the _next_ fullscreen OpenGL application hangs 
the system immediately on start.
