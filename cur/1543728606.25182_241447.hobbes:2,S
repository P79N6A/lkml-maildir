Hi!
is_head_of_free_region with count_and_copy_zone results results in
pretty nasty O(number_of_free_regions^2) behaviour, and some users see
cpu spending 40 seconds there :-(.
Actually count_and_copy_zone would probably be happy with
"is_free_page()".
I asked Lukas (who is seeing this problem) to kill locking from
is_head_of_free_region [we are running singlethreaded at this point,
so it should be ok]. Do you have any other ideas?
