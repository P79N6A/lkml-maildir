Its not that they just enable it.  Its that it has side effects.  I enable it to support
one device - it then 'devnaps' other devices that usbstorage supports _much_
better.  Is there some way it could work in reverse.  eg. let ub bind only if 
usbstorage does not, possibly making usbstorage a _little_ more conservative
if ub is present?
