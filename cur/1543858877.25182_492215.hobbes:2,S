One thing which isn't helping you is the way folk inevitably end up
using ftp.kernel.org rather than ftp.<cc>.kernel.org. [*]
Let me illustrate why.  Throw 
http://ftp.uk.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel
into a web browser.  The address changes to:
  
http://ftp.uk.kernel.org/sites/ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/
Hit reload a few times, and eventually be greated by:
Forbidden
You don't have permission to access /sites/ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/ on this server.
because one of the IPs which "ftp.uk.kernel.org" resolves to isn't a
part of the UK mirror service (who are providing most of ftp.uk.kernel.org),
and therefore has a different site policy.
Ergo, downloads via http from ftp.uk.kernel.org are at best unreliable
for multiple requests.
I agree that it's not directly your problem, and isn't something you
have direct control over.  However, if you want to round-robin the
<cc>.kernel.org IP addresses between different providers, I suggest
that either the name resolves to just one site, or that kernel.org
adopts a policy with their mirrors that they only become part of
the <cc>.kernel.org DNS entries as long as they do not rewrite their
site-specific URLs in terms of that address.
IOW, that URL above should've been:
  
http://hawking-if-b.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/
to ensure that mirrorservice.org's policy isn't uselessly applied to
someone elses mirror site.
Maybe then ftp.<cc>.kernel.org would become slightly more attractive.
* - I gave up with ftp.uk.kernel.org many years ago when it became
unreliable and haven't looked back, despite recent news that it's
improved.  But as illustrated above it does still have issues.  I
certainly would _not_ want to use ftp.uk.linux.org to obtain GIT
updates from as long as the current DNS situation persists - that
would be suicide.
