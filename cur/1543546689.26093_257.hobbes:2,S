We would only set last_cpu IF the process has run for N cycles, where N is
enough to fill the CPU cache. If 15 cycles loads the cache, then N=15. So in
that case, B's last_cpu would be set, and it would be tied to that
processor. The actual value is tunable, and depends largely on the size of
the L2 cache.
