Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

i've released the -Q9 patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc1-bk4-Q9
ontop of:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/diff-bk-040828-2.6.8.1.bz2
Changes:
 - fixed the cond_resched_softirq() bug noticed by Mika Penttila.
 - updated the preemption-friendly network-RX code but 8193too.c still
   produces delayed packets so netdev_backlog_granularity now defaults
   to 2, which seems to be working fine on my testbox.
 - the latency_trace output now includes the kernel and patch version,
   for easier sorting of reports.
