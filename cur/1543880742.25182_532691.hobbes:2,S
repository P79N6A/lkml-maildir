Hello,
This is exactly what I wanted some time ago,
Thank you very much, I was almost thinking of doing this myself 
(but decided that it is too difficult now for me and maybe doesn't worth the 
effort)
I want to point out on number of problems that this will solve (and reasons I 
wanted to do that)
First of all, today, packet writing on cd/dvd doesn't work well, it is very 
slow because 
now all file-systems are limited to 4k-barrier and cd/dvd can write only 
32k/64k packets.
This is why a pktcdvd was written and it emulates those 4k sectors by doing 
read/modify/write cycle
This cause a lot of seeks and read/writing switches and thus it is very slow.
By introducing a bigger that 4k page cache a dvd/cd can be divided is 64k/32k 
blocks that will be read an written freely
(Although dvd can read 2k  I don't think that reading a 64k block will hurt 
since most of time drive is busy seeking and locating a specific sector)
Now I thinking to implement this in an other way, I mean I want to teach udf 
filesystem to to packet writing on its own, bypassing disk cache (but not page 
cache)
Secondary 32/64k limitation is present of flash devices too, so they can 
benefit too, and I almost sure that future hard disks will use bigger block 
size too.
To summarize I want to tell that bigger pagesize will allow devices that have 
big hardware sectors to work fine in linux.
Best regards,
	Maxim Levitsky
