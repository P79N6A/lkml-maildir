And things change over time.  Back in those days the linux codebase was
small and it was easy to change things all over the place.  These times
our codebase is huge, and people that know enough parts of the kernel to
do big changes are overloaded with work.  Thus we have to set our
acceptance criteria a lot higher now - else we'd be totally lost with
the current size of the project already.

We do have plugins in the VFS, every filesystem is a set of a few of them
and some gluecode.
<skipping a lot stuff>
David and Hans, I've read through my backlog a lot now, and I must say
it's pretty pointless - you're discussing lots of highlevel what if and
don't actually care about something as boring as actual technical details.
Hans has lots of very skillfull technical people like zam and vs, and maybe
he should give them some freedom to sort out technical issues for a basic
reiser4 merge, and one that is done we can turn back to discussion of
advanced features and their implementation, hopefully with a few more
arguments on both sides and a real technical discussion.
