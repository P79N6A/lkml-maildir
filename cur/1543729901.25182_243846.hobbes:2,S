This seems to be the same resume order issue, that Shaohua is hitting.
On my system the resume order looks like this:
Resuming System Devices
Resuming type 'cpu':
 cpu0
aux driver resume 0xc010e410 (mtrr_restore)
aux driver resume 0xc03365f0 (cpufreq_resume)
Resuming type 'i8259':
 i82590
Resuming type 'timer':
 timer0
Resuming type 'pit':
 pit0
Resuming type 'lapic':
 lapic0
Resuming type 'irqrouter':
 irqrouter0
Resuming type 'i8042':
 i80420
The current theory I have for this issue is we resume pci_link driver
A bit too late, which is causing this problem.
Say a particular device doesn't do anything for suspend and resume.
So, as soon as we resume this particular device can start  
generating interrupts. Once we have PIC enabled, it starts sending 
interrupts and no one handles that original IRQ. As pci_link that 
resumes later is reprogramming the device to different IRQ, where the 
driver is handling the device.
That's probably the reason why it works with acpi=noirq or 
modified DSDT. Does it make sense?
I think we have to resume pci_link device before PIC. 
We should be able to achieve this my changing the makefile orders.
Thanks,
Venki
