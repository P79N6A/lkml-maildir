Alan is right here.
I have tryed the direct approach to kdev_t several years ago out.
The lost in speed caused by introducing the strcut was really noticable
in the overall device system's performance.
It was about scary several percents. Sorry I'm not quite
sure if my memmory leaves me, but it was about as much as 3% on a 
486/66MHz (Yes It was that long ago...)
And this after only folding the arrays indexed by MINOR(dev) into a
single
array of corresponding structs.
This was surely caused by the fact that after this folding the
processor cache got significantly more clobbered.
Please everybody going to hunt after kdev_t take this as a worning
that as I have said it already before: This is a task which will 
have quite a big impact on the overall driver interface design :-(.
