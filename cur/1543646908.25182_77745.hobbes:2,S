	It is the BUG() statement in check_highmem_ptes in mm/highmem.c:
#if CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM
void check_highmem_ptes(void)
{
        int idx, type;
        preempt_disable();
        for (type = 0; type < KM_TYPE_NR; type++) {
                idx = type + KM_TYPE_NR*smp_processor_id();
                if (!pte_none(*(kmap_pte-idx))) {
                        printk("scheduling with KM_TYPE %d held!\n", type);
                        BUG();
                }
        }
        preempt_enable();
}
#endif
	I'm updating to 2.5.41 and will post a trace if the problem
still occurs.
