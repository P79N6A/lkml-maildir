kmalloc/kfree debugging has been out-commented for a looong time-period
now. I'd suggest this option to be removed from the config.in files,
together with any existing remnants. I'd also suggest we make Alan's
slab-poisoning, adapted (if necessary) to the new memory-handler, a
kernel-hacking option. I find it to be a WONDERFUL help in the quest for
bugs...
