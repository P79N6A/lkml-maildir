Yes, there is.
Devices are suspended in the order reverse with respect to the one in which
they have been registered (ie. the last registered device is suspended first).
Still, if you want the serial console to work over the suspend, try booting the
kernel with the no_console_suspend command line switch (that's applicable to
the current mainline, there was a configuration option for that previously).
Greetings,
Rafael
