Subject: NFSv3 pathname problems in 2.4 kernels

   I am seeing a problem at the client side when trying to obtain pathnames of NFS-mounted entries.  This occurs when the NFS servers involved are Linux2.4 kernels and the clients are SGI Irix 6.5 or Solaris 2.6 (Linux 2.4 clients are Ok - 2.2 ones won't be using NFSv3).
   As an example of what happens.
o The server side has a pathname of /raid/sources/prog1 - a directory.
o /raid is exported
o The client NFS mounts /raid/sources as /projects/sources
o I cd to /projects/sources/prog1 and type /bin/pwd
   I expect to get /projects/sources/prog1 as the result, but I actually get /sources/prog1.
   Similar mounts from Linux2.2. systems (presumably running NFSv2) produce the expected (correct) result.
   I've snoop'ed the network traffic and one thing I can see is that the filehandle used in the NFSv3 mount is reported as being a different length (shorter) than those for v2.
   So,
a) has anyone else encountered these problems?
b) if so, do they have a solution?
c) how is the filehandle calculated in the 2.4 kernel for NFSv3?  Which routine is it in?  Perhaps I could try (optionally) forcing it to be the same length as a v2 filehandle to see whether that fixes things.  (I'd rather that the 2.4 kernel were optimally compatible rather than paranoically
correct.
   Hoping someone can help...
