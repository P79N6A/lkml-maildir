Personally I think interrupt threads, spinlocks as sleeping mutexes and PI
is something we should keep out of the kernel tree.  If you want such
advanced RT features use a special microkernel and run Linux as user
process, using RTAI or maybe soon some of the more sofisticated virtualization
technologies.
