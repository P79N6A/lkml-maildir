Again, CONFIG_WATCHDOG implies reset by definition. If you'd like to
propose pluggable policies for CONFIG_WATCHDOG and post the code for
that, go right ahead.
For soft lockups, there's already the softlockup code which does what
you seem to be leaning towards. For hard lockups (which is where
CONFIG_WATCHDOG comes in handy), you're likely not going to get any
output anyways. In either case, wiggling this in to CONFIG_WATCHDOG is
very much changing the meaning of what CONFIG_WATCHDOG means today, and
doesn't seem to buy us anything.
