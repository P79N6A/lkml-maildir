Are you using the OSS or ALSA driver?
[alistair] 01:38am [~] dmesg | egrep -e EMU10K1
Creative EMU10K1 PCI Audio Driver, version 0.20, 15:35:08 Apr 14 2003
emu10k1: EMU10K1 rev 7 model 0x8026 found, IO at 0xe400-0xe41f, IRQ 12
The soundcard is working perfectly with the OSS driver, for me, in 2.5.67-mm1. 
I'm running the latest version of the emu-tools. Please try matching this 
configuration.
Cheers,
Alistair.
