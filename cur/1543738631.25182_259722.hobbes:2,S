Yes.  I applied those seven changesets to an local tree.  If any other
bug fixes turn up between now and 2.6.9-final you can send an 008-patch
that sits on top of those.
Yesterday on LKML Linus says he's aiming for 2.6.9 in a week or so.
When that happens I'll pull this into my tree and push to him (I don't
want to put it into my bkbits tree yet ... just in case I have some
other critical patch for ia64 that needs to go into 2.6.9).
