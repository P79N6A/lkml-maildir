Well, you were right.. It's not a memory leak, but I still consider it a
bug... I can allocate small amounts of memory, and let it free up more as
I allocate and write to them, and by doing this, I can regain the
memory so that I can allocate it all at once -- I can't just allocate it
all at once from the start, though, because Linux apparently thinks it's
taken by something that won't free it up for me ;)
