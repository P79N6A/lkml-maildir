Hi Jacek,
You did not receive "GPE storm detected" message in earlier kernel only because
there was no detection of it. You can check if you have one by enabling "#define DEBUG" 
at the beginning of the /drivers/acpi/ec.c and looking into dmesg. If there is no storm,
you should see ony 2-3 interrupt messages per single transaction. Storm detector fires 
up at 8 excess interrupts.
Regards,
Alex.
