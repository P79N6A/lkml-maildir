Hello ,
I want to know where EXPORT_SYMBOL macro is defined  (in 2.4.18-3 kernel).
I saw in module.h that there are some #ifndef EXPORT_SYMBOL
that print an error if this symbols is nor defined , but searching
in the kernel sources did not gave me more results.
I also saw in the kernel Makefile that EXPORT_SYMBOL
appears in tags, but I do'nt know how to find the definition
for this macro.
Does somebody know ?
regards,
sting
