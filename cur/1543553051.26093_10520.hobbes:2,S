Ok. That's fine, the "obj-m" thing doesn't have any ordering constraints,
so we can do whatever we want to it. Including the $(filter-out ..) thing.

Yes. That's fine, again MIX_OBJS does not care about ordering, so
filtering etc is fine here.
The only thing I really care about is O_OBJS = $(obj-y), and with this
setup it seems to be a valid thing to do, with some slight hackery on the
other ones.
