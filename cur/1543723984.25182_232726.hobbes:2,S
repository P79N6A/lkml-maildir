 [#15]  The  three types char, signed char, and unsigned char
        are   collectively   called   the   character   types.   The
        implementation  shall  define  char  to have the same range,
	representation,  and  behavior  as  either  signed  char or
	unsigned char.35)

Tons of people use windows aswell.  You just showed that you don't know
C well enough, so maybe someone should better do an audit for your code ;-)
