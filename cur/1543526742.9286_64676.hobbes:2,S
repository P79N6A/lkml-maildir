(First, turn off the debug mode in ksymoops. Thanks)
I've seen the same thing on my alpha (Digital Server 3300) but only when
halt/reboot is called from the shutdown scripts.  If I send the magic
code to the kernel from a shell commandline (i.e. /sbin/reboot -f), it
doesn't do that.
I have not cared enough to find out why... I don't reboot the alpha
all that often :-)
