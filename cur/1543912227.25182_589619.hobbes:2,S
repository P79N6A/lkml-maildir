Wouldn't you achieve the same result by enabling hardware interrupt 
mitigation in eHEA in combination with NAPI? Presumably a 10G interface 
has hardware mitigation features?

I've been looking at this from a different angle. My goal is to optimize 
NAPI packet forwarding rates while minimizing packet latency. Using 
hardware interrupt mitigation hurts latency so I'm investigating ways to 
turn it off without risking NAPI poll on/off thrashing at certain packet 
rates.
Jan-Bernd, I think I've found a solution to the issue that you 
highlighted with my scheme yesterday and it doesn't involve generating 
other interrupts using hrtimers etc. :) Initial results are very 
encouraging in my setups. Would you be willing to test it with eHEA? I 
don't have a 10G setup. If results are encouraging, I'll post an RFC to 
ask for review / feedback from the NAPI experts here. What do you think?
