Why? I have exactly 4 HT CPUs (2 cores), no more. I use CPU hotplug so I 
can disable or enable any of them when I want to. So, this is a classic 
SMP system and 2.6.15 is totally happy with this. Or is there any other 
(better?) way to disable/enable CPU (especially second logical CPU from 
HT) on running systems?
