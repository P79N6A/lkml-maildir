Years ago Linux dumped OSS for ALSA because ALSA offered far better
functionality and support. Why would we go back to the stone age ?
Its something useful to various other platforms with basically no
hardware support but Linux has ALSA and very good hardware support and
ALSA even has emulation for back compatibility with old OSS apps.
Ten years ago it would probably have made a difference, five maybe, today
its a release of historical code at best, and since they shipped binary
modules for Linux more like 'getting around to complying with the
licence' than anything else.
