Now that there was some discussion about umount,
I released a version of mount/umount that perhaps
has a slightly better behaviour. Since the change
was largish (and is untested), don't put it blindly
into your distribution.
Another change was one intended to make things behave
a bit better for Japanese (with variable width characters).
Since I changed the patch a bit, it is quite possible
I broke things both for Japanese and English.
