that's still huge! The patch below fixes the panic_on_unrecovered_nmi 
thing ...

of course many people do.

so please do it. The fact that there are /other/ reductions possible 
doesnt mean we can be lax. It's like: "oh, the buddy allocator scales 
better now, so we can slow down the SLAB allocator". No, kernel size is 
like scalability: we need a million small steps.
the panic_on_unrecovered_nmi thing is gross anyway: it has no place in 
kernel.h, it should go into include/[asm-i386|x86_64]/nmi.h and not the 
generic headers. There the prototype can be made #ifdef APIC, hence 
eliminating the #ifdefs from traps.c. (that's all we care about anyway)
please dont throw away a perfectly fine config option.
