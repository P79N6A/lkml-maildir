 for more details.
I only had some programs segfault, but this got resolved by doing an
update of the OS (Debian). It also started after an update of Debian.
Both programs installed with Debian packages as self-compiled programs
crashed with the ".. general protection rip: .." and ".. segfault at
..".
This happened on a dual Opteron Tyan system running 2.6.12-rc5.
