You's misquoting me.  IF you quoted the whole context it'd be pretty
sure that the part of the filesystem that intefaces with the VFS is
meant.
But one could even say VFS is integral part of a linux filesystem as
it does most of the work a filesystem driver does in other operating
systems.

It really depends on how you sent them.  If you had a big patch without
explanations - sure.
