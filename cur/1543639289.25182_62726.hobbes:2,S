Subject: [PATCH] (2/4) discontigmem support for i386 against 2.5.30
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch restructures setup_arch() for i386 to make it easier to
include the i386 numa changes (for CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM) I've been 
working on.  It also makes setup_arch() easier to read.  A version 
of this patch is the in 2.4 aa tree.
This patch does not depend on the other patches I'm submitting today, but 
my discontigmem patch does depend on this one. 
I've tested this patch on the following configurations: UP, SMP, SMP PAE, 
multiquad, multiquad PAE.
Any and all feedback regarding this patch is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Pat
