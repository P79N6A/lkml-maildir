That's exactly the approach I intend to take in the short run. In the
longer run I'll spend some time thinking about the "generic" solution
and see where it leads.
Another thought that crossed my mind is that this *specific* counter
might be part of Richard Gooch's performance counters (I haven't looked
into these counters yet, so consider it an off-hand remark).
