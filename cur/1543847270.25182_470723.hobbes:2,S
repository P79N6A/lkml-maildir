Ok.  From looking at an individual case the ioapic is programmed
correctly and I don't see a reason the local apic would be programmed
incorrectly.  However logical delivery mode and lowest priority
delivery mode are enabled.  So we are asking the interrupt delivery
subsystem to choose a cpu to deliver the interrupt to and then are not
giving the cpu any choice.  So we may be confusing things. 
Can you try CONFIG_CPU_HOTPLUG?  That will force genapic to be set
to genapic_physflat instead of genapic_flat.
I am hoping that by running the apics in a different delivery mode
that explicitly says just deliver this interrupt to this cpu we
will avoid the problem you are seeing.
If genapic_physflat works we will have to decide what to do about
genapic_flat.
Thanks,
Eric
