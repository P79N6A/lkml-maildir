New version of FAT patch is out there.
News:
	UMSDOS seems to be working with it now.
	sticky bit handling removed from UMSDOS (done in VFS since December).
	Matija's UMSDOS patch included.
TODO:
 	fat_get_entry() optimization (*badly* needed, since it's used more
active than in old implementation).
 	fat_readdir_x() cleanup (related to previous).
	real UMSDOS cleanup.
 	internationalization stuff.
	UMSDOS still requires cleanup. This patch simply makes it work
with the new FAT code and doesn't fix any bugs of UMSDOS proper.
	I consider this patch as beta. I.e. it's unlikely to let the magic
smoke out of your disk, but don't try it on living filesystems. Help with
testing is more than welcome. It definitely fixes a lot of bugs in
FAT-derived stuff and seriously reduces the size of fs/msdos/* and
fs/vfat/*.
 
 	Patch (against 2.2.6-pre3) lives on 
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/fat-patch-11.gz
