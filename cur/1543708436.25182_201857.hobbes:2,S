Ahh, yes, of course.

Well, to be fair, most people count on it not changing, i.e. it is
deterministic at least, such that if you don't change hardware or add
logical drives, you won't see any changes between boots.  For most
users, file system labels serve quite well to keep things consistent.
For swap, raw devices, and the like, devlabel or udev are used, but at
least devlabel (sorry Greg, I haven't played with udev too much yet)
uses SCSI inquiry page 83 or 80 data if it's there, which megaraid
doesn't provide.
For the install scenario, EDD (which megaraid *does* provide) will
suffice, but I need to get distro installers to start using it. ;-)
Oh, and get it working on x86-64.  That should be easy, soon as I have
access to such a system for a few days.
