Broken again :/
Since you're using mutt, try manually choosing the mime type and
transfer encoding.
After adding the attachment, select it, press Ctrl+t to change the type
to e.g. application/octet-stream, then press Ctrl+e to change the
transfer encoding back to 8bit. Mutt is quite friendly in that regard :)
