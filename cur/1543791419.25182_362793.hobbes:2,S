That's the right way to do it.

get_user_pages() raises page_count, not page_mapcount.  You shouldn't set
PG_locked (and if you did, ought only to do so via lock_page): that was
done at one time in early 2.4, but it's irrelevant (and a problem when
the same page appears more than once in the list).
It remains unlikely but possible that rmap will come along and remove
the page from its place in the user address space before the DMAing
has finished; but that does not matter, so long as any user access
to that address faults the right pinned page back in.
The only extant problem here is if the pages are private, and you
fork while this is going on, and the parent user process writes to the
area before completion: then COW leaves the child with the page being
DMAed into, giving the parent a copied page which may be incomplete.

It's important that any necessary COW be done at get_user_pages time,
if there's any possibility that you'll be DMAing into them.  So when
in doubt, call it for write access.

You don't have that guarantee, but you shouldn't need it: when in doubt,
let it set them dirty beforehand.  As to afterwards, if I remember
rightly, there's a race by which the pages might be written out and
dirty cleared before your DMA completed, so you actually do need to
mark them dirty after - searching fs/ for get_user_pages() use suggests
so.  Take a look at Andrew's educational comment on set_page_dirty_lock
in mm/page-writeback.c.  You do have the list of pages you need to
page_cache_release, don't you?  So it should be easy to dirty them.
