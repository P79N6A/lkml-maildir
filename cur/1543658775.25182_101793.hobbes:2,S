I agree with the philosophy in general, but if I sit down to write a 
threaded application for Linux on IA-32 and wind up with a design that 
uses 800+ threads in any instance (other than a bug, which was our 
case), it's time to give up the day job and start riding on the back of 
the garbage truck ;)

You mean the 800+ threads or Java on Linux?

In all honesty, I would enjoy nothing more than contributing to kernel 
development. Unfortunately it's a bit out of my scope right now (but not 
forever). If I only believed aliens seeded our gene pool with clones, I 
could hook up with those folks that claim to have cloned a human and get 
one of me made! ;)
