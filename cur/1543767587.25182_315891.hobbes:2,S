Due to the 640k base memory limitations, you need to use bzImage for
any kernel that is over about 500k compressed.  There is absolutely no
reason I can think of for not using bzImage.  All the boot loaders
support it just fine, and the result is the same after loading.  It
doesn't change the size of the kernel, just how large a kernel the boot
loader can load.
With the size of 2.6 kernels I consider zImage imposible to use anymore,
and it has never caused me any trouble to use bzImage.  It seems that
practically bzImage is requried on x86 for 2.6 kernels.  I don't know
how small you could make it if you left out everything except initrd and
cramfs support (assuming your kernel supports cramfs initrd's).  Even
ext2 is rather big.
