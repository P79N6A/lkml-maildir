   NT5 beta claims to
They can avoid the extraneous copy, but what they cannot do with most
PC networking cards is avoid touching the data since most cards do not
provide a hardware checksumming facility.
Most of this would suggest that their existing architecture passes
mbuf-chain-like buffers to the networking drivers in NT, or some other
kind of scatter-gather list like scheme.  This is the only way they
could do zero-copy without driver updates from all the networking card
vendors.
