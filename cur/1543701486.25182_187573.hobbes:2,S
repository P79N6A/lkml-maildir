# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:
# Project Name: Linux kernel tree
# This patch format is intended for GNU patch command version 2.5 or higher.
# This patch includes the following deltas:
#	           ChangeSet	1.1356  -> 1.1357 
#	     fs/jbd/commit.c	1.6     -> 1.7    
#
# The following is the BitKeeper ChangeSet Log
# --------------------------------------------
# 04/01/01	tytso@think.thunk.org	1.1357
# Apply 4007-akpm-page-reap.patch
# 
# With data=ordered it is often the case that a quick write-and-truncate will
# leave large numbers of pages on the page LRU with no ->mapping, and attached
# buffers.  Because ext3 was not ready to let the pages go at the time of
# truncation.
#  
# These pages are trivially reclaimable, but their seeming absence makes the VM
# overcommit accounting confused (they don't count as "free", nor as
# pagecache).  And they make the /proc/meminfo stats look odd.
#  
# So what we do here is to try to strip the buffers from these pages as the
# buffers exit the journal commit.
# --------------------------------------------
