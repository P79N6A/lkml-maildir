I don't know if they are obsolete or not.  I've never used them, and
trying to figure out the floppy driver just makes my head hurt.  I'm
sure that if anyone really does use them, and udev doesn't work for
them, I'll hear about it :)

I don't think that all 4 users of devfs on 2.6 are all that vocal :)
Either way, I haven't been paying attention, as I really don't care.

There's no accounting for taste, is there.  Anyway, sure some users
might be happy, but when the kernel vfs maintainer shows that it's
pretty simple to deadlock your kernel, and when the devfs maintainer
disappears from view for over a year, that might be a good indication
that you might want to stop using it.
Besides, there's only one "major" distro still using devfs, and that's
just because they don't know any better.
