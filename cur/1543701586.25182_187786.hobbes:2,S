I'm looking for a technical comparison between the major file systems. 
At a minimum I'd like to see a comparison between ext3, reiserfs, xfs 
and jfs. In the oh so perfect world I'd like to see detailed info on all 
supported file systems.
Please CC or mail me directly as I am not a subscriber to this list.
Thanks

In theory, there's no difference between theory and practice, but in 
practice there is.
