One set of patches in testing.
For the irda non-tty device its almost impossible to hack up a sane
solution except to delete the junk. pppd has supported "notty" for some
years so there is no excuse for that still being present.
The ones with actual ttys can be done cleanly so I've
- split n_tty_ioctl
- used the split to create tty_mode_ioctl() which an ldisc can use for
generic mode handling
- extracted the flush method so it can be used more cleanly by ppp etc
Patches to follow shortly for review
Alan
