Hi developers,
some places in fs/*.c have conditions like
(namei.c, 238, in "int permission()"):
        if(inode->i_op && inode->i_op->permission)
Others just have
(namei.c, 813, in "int fastcall link_path_walk()"):
        if(!inode->i_op->lookup)
My question is: Which one is right wrt the case "i_op ==/!= NULL"?
There are two ways:
- the kernel assumes i_op (and similar) is always non-NULL
  => then we can remove a lot of checks, like the first example above
- the kernel does not assume...
  => then we need some extra checks, like in the second example above
