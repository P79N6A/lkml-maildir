Subject: [PATCH] sysfs -- don't crash if removing non-existant attribute group
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Some (buggy) network drivers in 2.6 decide to set the statistics hook,
after registration. This causes unregister_netdevice to crash because it attempts 
to remove the 'statistics' attribute group it thought was created.  
This fixes sysfs so it ignores the problem.  Another set of patches
will address the remaining buggy ether drivers.
