Subject: [PATCH] pci_find_device --> pci_get_device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The patch is for mixed files from all over the tree.
Kernel version: 2.6.13-rc3-git4
* This patch removes from kernel tree pci_find_device and changes
it with pci_get_device. Next, it adds pci_dev_put, to decrease reference
count of the variable.
* Next, there are some (about 10 or so) gcc warning problems (i. e.
variable may be unitialized) solutions, which were around code with old
pci_find_device.
* Some code was unpretty, or ugly, so the patch provides more readable
code, in some cases.
* Marks the function as deprecated in pci.h
