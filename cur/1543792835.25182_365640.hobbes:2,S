i'm running your timer-test script with an earlier config you sent 
(kernel-2.6.13-i686-smp.ccrma.config), on a similar SMP box, and i'm not 
getting these timeout problems (using -rt9). How easily do the above 
problems reproduce - does it happen right after bootup?
(to make sure could you send me your current SMP .config too? You have 
CONFIG_KTIME_SCALAR disabled, right?)
