So where do we stand with this?
As I understand the Cobalt system controller it is not possible to address
ioport addresses below 0x10000000 at all on the PCI bus of the GT-64111.
As such I think the best solution is a GT-64111-specific PCI fixup to
clear out legacy resources.  The IDE controller in the VIA VT82C586 could
then be used only by its normal that is non-legacy address and
commit fd6e732186ab522c812ab19c2c5e5befb8ec8115 could be reverted and PPC
would be happy too?
