I've applied this to net-2.6.25, thanks everyone.
I know I said we should deploy this as fast as possible,
but we are really coming down the wire as far as releasing
2.6.24 is concerned and I don't want to put anything into
my pushes to Linus that he might not like and thus cause
the entire set of bug fixes to be rejected.
Thanks again.
