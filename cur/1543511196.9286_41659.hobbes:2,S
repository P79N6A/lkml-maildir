I just found something interesting.  Playing with a machine (I have my
network at work setup to boot any system off floppy and mount a dir from the
server) I noticed the cdrom (ide) shows up with multiple luns when using the
ide-scsi driver.  This is a teac cd-516e rev 1.0c.  It's a single tray
cdrom.
