Please just delete the lock_cpu_hotplug()/unlock_cpu_hotplug() calls.  Any
code which runs inside preempt_disable() is automatically protected from
cpu hot-unplug.
It's not presently 100% protected against cpu hot-add, but it's good enough
for now: the setting of the flag in cpu_online_map is the last thing which
happens.  To make this 100% tight we should probably run __cpu_up() via
stop_machine_run().
