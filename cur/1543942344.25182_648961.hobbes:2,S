Yeah, since fixed.

The watchdog is disabled by default, the bandwidth is .95s every 1s,
which is mainly a safe-guard against run-away real-time tasks. As long
as real-time usage stays within those limits nothing happens. If you
don't like it set sched_rt_runtime [*] to -1.
[*] provided in the interface changes posted a few days ago.

I don't see why this would be needed.

Already did this somewhere along the line.

It is.
