Christian,
Mind reposting the patch after making it compliant with Documentation/SubmittingPatches or -
AKPM's famous - 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
 ?
Send it to at least akpm@osdl.org, stable@kernel.org and to
Greg KH.
If you can't for some reason, let me know - I will post one later today.
Thanks
Parag
