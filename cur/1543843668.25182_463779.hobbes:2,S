Paul,
Please apply and submit upstream. These patches are not urgent, 
and are mostly harmless.
The following set of patches add support for the MMIO-enabled
EEH recovery path, that is, for the path through te PCI error 
recovery code where the device driver claims it can recover 
on its own, and just wants MMIO enabled.  
Actually, the first two patches are misc EEH cleanup, 
the last two implement this function.
