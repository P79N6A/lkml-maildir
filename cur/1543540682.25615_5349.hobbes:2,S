Hmmm, I have an early BP6. It has been fairly stable since I
upgraded to a recent BIOS (QQ-beta, haven't upgraded since). The
only unplanned (unexpected) downtime in the last couple of weeks was
probably due to the SMP PS/2 mouse bug I've heard about. I'm not
counting playing with some new USB and Ext3 code... The previous
unplanned/unexpected down time was the last time I tried to get my
sound card working.
I run X.
I use an AGP video card.
I put grease on the BX chip, but no fan.
I don't overclock (it's never worked even the slightest amount on this board).
I run 2 copies of setiathome constantly, at lowest priority.
The room has regularly been over 72F in the daytime.
I don't use the HPT366 controller (yet).
I do use the builtin IDE controller.
I use a USB trackball as my primary pointing device.
I have had uptimes of several weeks at a time, logged in to X the whole time.
I use a tulip-based NIC, and there is constant network traffic.
