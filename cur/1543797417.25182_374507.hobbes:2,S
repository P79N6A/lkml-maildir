I case this (still) isn't clear, I am addressing the attitude of "It's
ACPI so it's not going to be used, period".
About the exact technical implementation, I do not have an opinion,
because I don't have the knowledge.
BTW I try to not actually insult people (as others here seems to like to
do). If someone really feels offended, my apologies. I cannot hide some
irritation though.
