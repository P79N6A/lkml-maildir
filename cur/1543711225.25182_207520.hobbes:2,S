I agree that it is a cleanup, but I disagree on the "problem" part.

FD_ISSET() is broken if it returns anything but 0/1, in my not-so-humble 
opinion.
Looking at the implementations, you are right that some architectures 
don't do this right, but that is a bug, and it's a bug in FD_ISSET(), not 
in fcntl.
The fact is, FD_ISSET() isn't always used in just as a conditional, and
you're supposed to be able to do
	int was_set = FD_ISSET(..);
	...
and in fact I'd suggest very _strongly_ that it also should work with
	bool is_set = FD_ISSET(..);
where some people use "char" for booleans for space reasons.
That implies that while non-zero for "set" is ok, that non-zero had better
have the _low_ bits set. Which is not true on architectures that use just
a logical and with the bits in the word.
Which implies that FD_ISSET() really must NOT be of that "logical and" 
approach, which in turn implies that it should be either a inequality 
expression, or it should be a "shift down and then and with 1".
And in both of those cases, the result ends up being 0/1. So we might as 
well just make it so.
In short, the real bug is elsewhere.

Not in theory, no. In practice, it always is.
I'd suggest architecture maintainers fix their __FD_ISSET() 
implementations to conform to the proper return value.
