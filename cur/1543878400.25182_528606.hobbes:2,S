Hi,
Distribution installers usually try to probe OSes for building a suited
grub menu.  Unfortunately, mounting an ext3 partition, even in read-only
mode, does perform some operations on the filesystem (log recovery).
This is not a good idea since it may silently garbage data.  XFS has a
norecovery option that allows to disable that, I'd say ext3/4 should
have it too.
