This bug is fixed in loop-AES package. In addition to this bug fix it fixes
many other bugs as well, and achieves correct write ordering when used with
journaling file systems.

Jim,
If you want your data secure, you need to re-encrypt your data anyway.
Mainline loop crypto implementation has exploitable vulnerability that is
equivalent to back door. Kerneli.org folks have always shipped back-doored
loop crypto, and now mainline folks are shipping back-doored loop crypto.
Kerneli.org derivatives such as Debian, SuSE, and others are also
back-doored.
