Oops.  I cut & pasted the wrong commit id.  The fix went in as
commit 7091138fb762aed22317b4ff91eb211e7da3865c.

So this confuses me.  Linus pulled this into his tree on Friday (IIRC), but
at the very latest on Saturday (as there is a commit *after* this one that
is dated 2007-07-28 19:29:37).
The patch that is in the tree appears to be identical to the one that
Thomas Renninger posted to this thread, and you confirmed as working.
So when you have a moment, please pull latest Linus tree.  Confirm that
this patch is present:
 $ grep hp_ioc_iommu_device_ids arch/ia64/hp/common/sba_iommu.c
 static const struct acpi_device_id hp_ioc_iommu_device_ids[] = {
 	.ids		= hp_ioc_iommu_device_ids,
 $
and that it builds and boots for you.
Thanks
