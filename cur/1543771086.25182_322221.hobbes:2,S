Hello!
Is it possible to select (in userspace) which pins
should be enabled or do I have to write a kernel driver
for that?
I want to switch a light on/off through my parallel port
(attached to a optocoupler, which is attached to an ATX
power supply), so I can control the heat in my
drying chamber for the eggs of my bearded dragon.
Greetings,
Nico
