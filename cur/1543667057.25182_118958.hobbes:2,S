And, even with "devfs=nomount" on the boot line and no devfs used I still
get the same error once the jaz drive totally cycles down.  
Besides building the kernel without devfs is there a good solution for this?
: Well, the second test just now didn't work right.
: /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target4/lun0/disc did exist this time around but I got
: the same error as before trying to get anything going on it and I can no
: longer get the jaz drive to work.
