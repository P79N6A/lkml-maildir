There is actually a similar copy in arch/arm/mm/consistent.c, but at the
time I cleaned it up to be something saner.  With some tweaks (such as
adding a struct vm_region_head which contains the spinlock, as well as
the start/end and list) we essentially end up with a generic memory
region allocator suitable for vmalloc, ioremap, module stuff, and so
forth.
If anyone's interested in that, I'll sort out those tweaks.
