I do too, except the card is still in my camera when I do it.  But, I 
do have to ask, why the ro?  I regularly do housekeeping in the 
camera once I've downloaded the images I want.  The only problem I've 
had is related to deleting the first images all in a row.  Apparently 
fat thinks an empty sector is the end of the directory.  So one must 
delete on LIFO basis.
