Well, there are reasons *against* your implementation:
1) waking laptop at random time (737 taking off?) may be dangerous for
the laptop (and its surroundings)
2) old li-ions are probably able to keep laptop suspended for 20
hours, but will die if you attempt to resume after 10 hours of sleep
without ac power.
That said, patch for 's2ram, wakeup on battery low' for uswsusp would
be welcome.
