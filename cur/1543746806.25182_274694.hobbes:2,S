We have userspace to do this, surely? Make the standard method of
triggering resume involve an initrd, and have a small application that
does sanity checks before the resume. In case of failure, have it prompt
the user. As long as it doesn't do bad things to the filesystem,
there's no danger. There's no reason to do this in the kernel.
