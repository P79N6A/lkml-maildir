Subject: ppdev interface for USB to parallel port adapter?

I have an AVR microcontroller programmer that connects to the parallel
port. It is controlled by a programm called avrdude that uses the
ppdev programming interface on /dev/parport* to manipulate the
parallel port I/O signals.
On my legacy-free laptop, I use an external USB-BAY that provides a
serial and parallel port. However, this parallel port is controlled by
the usblp driver, and cannot be accesed via ppdev. I checked the usblp
driver to see if parport support could be added, but I'm not sure.
It isn't clear to me whether the USB protocol provides enough
functionality to implement the ppdev ioctl's. Can anyone shed some
light on this?
BTW, lsusb reports for this device:
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0711:0300 Magic Control Technology Corp. BAY-3U1S1P Parallel Port
and the kernel reports:
