Dear ext3-users,
we hit this condition in fs/ext3/inode.c:ext3_block_to_path()
 if (i_block < 0) {
                ext3_warning (inode->i_sb, "ext3_block_to_path", "block < 0");
occasionally on two identical PATA-IDE disks copied over per filesystem-rsync.
What is the impact of this condition?
- Kernel was 2.6.13.4, CONFIG_LBD is not set but CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y
  (I can provide further details, if required)
- S.M.A.R.T meant everything is ok on both disks.
- Machine has been rebooted and fscked (180 days without reboot).
- Result of this fsck is not known.
The condition didn't happen after this anymore.
Regards
Ingo Oeser
