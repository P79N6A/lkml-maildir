That's what I was hoping. Having both contiguous would be of some
benefit, but of course at the cost of having to unfragment physical
pages. Even if Andi can cleanly do that with rmap, it's still going to
cost (page copies, Dcache footprint, locking and more). I like the
"wide" TLB approach much more.

Completely behind the kernel's, back? Even so, is there some hint we
can give to the CPU to help? Or perhaps a hint an application can give
to the kernel to specify better alignment of mappings? The latter
would require a way for the kernel to find out the preferred alignment
from the CPU. Is this information available?
Anyone know if AMD does this as well?
