For what its worth, I noticed this too, only here are my details:
 2.1.132 WORKED (patched up to ac2).
 2.2pre1 WORKED as downloaded (after the PCI bios cfg fix).
 2.2pre1-ac1 WORKED no problems.
 2.2pre1-ac2 CRASHED / OOPSes at the partition check as well.
It attempts to check the partition on my /dev/sda drive (which is DOSfs,
FAT16),
then crashes. Linux is on the /dev/hda drive, booting Linux (bzImage)
from Loadlin.
I tried a couple builds of the kernel with the AC2 patch, same result
each time.
Hardware is:
- P-II (celeron 300a)
- Abit BH-6 motherboard (Intel BX chipset)
- Adaptec 2940 U(not UW) PCI SCSI. (dos fat16)
- EIDE 3.2 G Western Digital drive (ext2)
PS. Can someone tell me how to capture the OOPS info when the system
crashes hard like this at boot time ?
Thanks
Mike
