There is extensive per sector error correction on each sector written. 
What you would see in this case (or many, many other possible ways 
drives can corrupt media) is a "media error" on the next read.
You would never get back the partially written contents of that sector 
at the host.
Having our tools (fsck especially) be resilient in the face of media 
errors is really critical. Although I don't think the scenario of a 
partially written sector is common, media errors in general are common 
and can develop over time.

See the NetApp paper from Sigmetrics 2007 for some interesting analysis...
