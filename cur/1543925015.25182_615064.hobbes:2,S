Subject: [PATCH 7/8] PVDMA: Guest: Add Kconfig options to select PVDMA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/7/133

This is to be enabled on a guest. Currently, only
'module' works; compiling it in freezes at HD bringup
