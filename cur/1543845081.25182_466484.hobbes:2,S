Guys! Why can't you see yet that all this uswsusp business is sheer
lunacy? All of the important code is done in the kernel, and must be
done in the kernel. Moving the little bit of high level logic that can
be done in userspace to userspace doesn't mean you're doing the
suspending in userspace.
If you have to use userspace for suspending, use it for the things that
don't matter, like the user interface, not the things that will break
suspending and resuming if they break.
