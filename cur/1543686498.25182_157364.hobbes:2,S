Yes, that would be interesting.

Well. Might be, but this is unlikely. And I do not remember anything like that.
I will take a closer look, though.

sounds like quite typical setup for some tasks (like clusters I guess).

This works for ext3
For reiserfs we have similar compile time option that is called
CONFIG_REISERFS_CHECK 
Thank you for all the time and efforts you are putting into finding out
