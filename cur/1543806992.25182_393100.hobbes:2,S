Please debug suspend2disk first, and talk about them separately. They
are really different. If you have problem with suspend2disk, it should
be easy to solve it (or at least point you at problematic module). I
would not want to promise that for suspend2ram (we can usually fix
that, too, but). Please keep them separate.
