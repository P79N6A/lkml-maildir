Hello Linux developers,
Sharp Electronics Corporation manufactures a series of handheld
computers called the Zaurus. The new ones run Linux.
Sharp sells a digital camera, the CE-AG06 that works with the SL-5500,
SL-5600 and SL-6000. To use this camera, a Linux module sharpzdc_cs.o is
required.
There are several copies of the Linux Zaurus source on the web; none of
them contain the source code for this module. I am attempting to use the
official source code offer that came with the device instead of the web
copies. When I do manage to get Sharp to do this, I anticipate they will
not include the source for this particular module.
Sharp distributes sharpzdc_cs.o in the Zaurus ROM image alongside Linux.
You can look at the module here:
http://oz.pdai.org/mirror/camera-modules-2.4.18-rmk7-pxa3-embedix.tar.bz2
I have read, 
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/COPYING.modules
Summary: A Linux module is a derivative work unless a strong case is
made otherwise.
I would like to know if this is one of those exception cases. That is
why I used the word 'not' in the subject line.
Is sharpzdc_cs.o *not* a derivative work of Linux?
