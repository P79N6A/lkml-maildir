take a look at lockdep: amongst other things it adds the TRACE_IRQFLAGS 
/ irqflags.h infrastructure, which could easily be modified to allow the 
easy replacement of cli/sti/pushf/popf. I wrote it with the side-goal of 
paravirtualization. I.e. instead of the DISABLE_INTERRUPT / 
ENABLE_INTERRUPT duplication you do in -mm currently please just enhance 
irqflags.h to cover the needs of paravirtualization too. (most of which 
should be the moving of cli/sti into the assembly callbacks)
into that the PDA would plug in a natural way: current->hardirqs_enabled 
is basically just an alias for 
!xen_shared_info->vcpu[smp_processor_id()].mask.
