In order for it to be useful, every set_pte() call has to get the
new args.  If there are exceptions, then it doesn't work out cleanly.
All of the call sites of set_pte() have the information available,
so implementing it properly in all cases is nearly trivial, it's
just a lot of busy work.  So we should get it over with now.
I did all of the generic code, it's just each platform's code that
needs updating.
And BTW it's not just set_pte(), it's also pte_clear() and some of
the other routines that need the added mm and address args.
