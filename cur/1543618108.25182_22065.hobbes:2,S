Hello,
I have a problem running kernel 2.4.17 patched with 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-kernel/v2.4/preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.17-1.patch
First I must say that I run 2.4.17 + international patches (crypto fs)
and freeswan. I know I should test with just preempt to see what happens,
but I have to find time ... and 2.4.17+crypto+freeswan works correctly.
the story:
I patched in this order:
2.4.17+preempt+crypto+freeswan
The symptom is: only slot 00 of pccard works. inserting a card in slot 01
does nothing although yenta_socket reports 2 slots found in /var/log/messages
(I see no difference in logs between working kernel and broken one).
Now I am using a kernel patched in this order:
2.4.17+crypto+freeswan and both slots (00 and 01) behave correctly.
Hardware is dell latitude C600 (with apm problem on standard kernel by the way ...)
Does anyone see some light there ?
Could the symptom really be linked to preempt patch ?
I'd love to see if preempt really is interesting on a laptop ...
If it does interest someone, I could test just 2.4.17+preempt just to see ...
Pascal
