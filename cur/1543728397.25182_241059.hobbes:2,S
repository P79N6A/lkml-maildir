If you want to emphasize the differences, this might help:  cpusets 
allows apps to be confined to a set for gaining benefits like cache 
affinity and reduced memory latency. CKRM doesn't and cannot and in this 
use case, the two are orthogonal.
But when apps are being confined to a set of cpus *only* for purposes of 
  getting a certain fraction of the total compute power, cpusets are not 
orthogonal in intent, not implementation, from a CKRM CPU class 
implementing hard limits. More capable of achieving those limits, yes, 
but orthogonal, no.
Note that this does not suggest the joint use of the two mechanisms - 
merely that there exists a usage scenario where both are relevant and 
for users of which, a common interface might be handy.

What's your opinion on the commonalities between the two interfaces 
pointed out in my previous mail ?
Also, if CKRM were to move to the "each controller exports its own 
interface" model, how would this affect the discussion ?

No one is questioning that the internals differ. There is very little in 
common between a CKRM I/O controller and its CPU controller too. But 
that doesn't prevent them from sharing the same interface.
I repeat - the question isn't one of the internals - its about the 
interface. Do you think there's *any* merit to cpusets sharing the rcfs 
interface *if* the latter were to make the changes mentioned in earlier 
mail ?
If not (and others agree), lets end this discussion and move on - both 
projects have enough to do. If there is some commonality, lets see what 
we can do to enhance the eventual user's experience.
