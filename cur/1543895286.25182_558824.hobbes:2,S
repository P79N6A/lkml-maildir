Chuck, Ingo, thanks for the responses.

Is it not possible for the mwait to get stuck?

Yes, the patch does make the pauses go away.  In fact just the
smp_mb() seems to suffice.

I looked at the utrace patch, and it still has wait_task_inactive(),
and I can still reproduce the freezes with the utrace patch applied.
