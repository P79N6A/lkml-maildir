In find_first_bit() there exists this the sequence:
shll $3,%%edi
addl %%edi,%%eax
LEA knows how to multiply by small powers of 2 and add all in one shot very
efficiently:
leal (%%eax,%%edi,8),%%eax
In find_first_zero_bit() the sequence:
shll $3,%%edi
addl %%edi,%%edx
could similarly become:
leal (%%edx,%%edi,8),%%edx
