   As far as I can tell there is no point flushing the ZERO_PAGE to
   RAM.  Does this patch seem reasonable?  (It's against 2.3.12 if
   that matters.)
The case where you have removed the flush is not always the
ZERO_PAGE, and after the cow page copy that flush certainly is needed
for consistancy on several ports.
