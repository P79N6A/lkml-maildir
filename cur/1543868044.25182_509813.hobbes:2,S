Hi Karim,
Yes, that was indeed the first way I implemented it, as a "disable"
option. One of the main thing we have to figure out before I modify this
is if we want to have the generic version of markers available in a
"forced" manner at the marker site with the GEN_MARK macro instead of
the MARK macro (this is the actual implementation). It has proven to
be useful to instrument lockdep.c irq enable/disable tracing functions.
The reason why is because they are called just before the trap handler
returns and I need it to do XMC on x86 and x86_64. It would therefore
cause a recursive trap.
I think it makes sense to have this kind of support for hard-to-instrument
sites within the marker infrastructure, but the cost is to have two
marker flavors : MARK and GEN_MARK (but really GEN_MARK is only intended
for a few sites).
