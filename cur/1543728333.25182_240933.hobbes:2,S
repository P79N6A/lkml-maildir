If you don't want console messages, you just disable console at all, or
you use a serial console (using the "console=" on the kernel command
line), or you adjust the kernel console log level. Please have a look
at the "dmesg" manual page, especially the "-n" parameter. In emergency
situations, Alt-Sysrq-[0-8] will allow you to do the same (on VGA
consoles for PCs, that is. for serial consoles use Break-[0-8]).

Not all the world is a PC, there is a lot of linux beyond x86. Looks to
me like you haven't done development on embedded systems that don't
have any VGA terminal at all.
Getting kernel messages on a certain pseudo tty is just a matter of
supplying the correct "console=" paramater to the kernel. For example:
"console=tty1" will get your console output on pseudo tty 1.
Alternatively, you can configure syslog to write all kernel messages to
a pseudo tty.

Here is the original question:
  Thanks for the pointer! My user mode program is running. Any idea how to
  control which console it shows up on?
No reference on how to get kernel messages somewhere.

That was true for linux < 2.1.71, which was released almost 7 years
ago. Things have changed. Newer kernels use the "console=" kernel
command line to select the console. With multiple the "console="
parameter, you can even have mutiple consoles.
