Sorry about that. A lot of these patches I "inherited" when I took over
the Ubuntu kernel. So there are likely some authorship slip ups, which I
am happy to fix.
If this is scheduled for entry, then I'll just let it go from there.
Just wanted to make sure we weren't holding any patches back from the
rest of the world.
Thanks
