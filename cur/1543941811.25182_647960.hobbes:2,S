 Well, buried in some other activities.  You certainly have had my ack to 
remove dec_esp.c already and I started to work on replacement front-end 
drivers long ago.
 Unfortunately one of the three hardware configurations to be supported by 
the front-ends does not fit the interrupt handling model implemented by 
the esp_scsi.c core.  Or it is actually the other way round as you cannot 
adjust hardware to fit the driver, so I am in a process of rewriting the 
core a little bit in this respect -- the core switches to interrupt 
polling under some circumstances and does not expect a higher-priority 
interrupt of a different kind to arrive from the bus master controller the 
SCSI chips are attached to instead.
 Being no SCSI expert though I have to study the SCSI spec well enough to 
understand some bits and I am somewhat distracted these days, so it may 
take a while yet.  It is at the highest priority on my to-do list though.
