The 64 bit piece works fine here and I used it for debugging the vmalloc 
work. Not sure about the 32 bit piece.

Great! Someone else picks this up. You can probably do a more thorough 
job than I can.

Hmmm.. We could use include/linux/bounds.h to make 
VMALLOC_START/VMALLOC_END (or whatever you need for checking the memory 
boundaries) a cpp constant which may allow the use in page_32.h without 
circular dependencies.
