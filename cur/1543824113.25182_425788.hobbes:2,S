Exactly, and while I know my network connection isn't exactly
representative of the general population of people building the kernel,
it's currently faster for me to download and unpack a .gz than to wait
the extra time for bzip2 to decompress. I've always found it quicker
dealing with .gz's for incremental patches. I thought the speed issue is
more of a speed / compression ratio trade-off, ie a caveat of
compression in general.
Mind you, 'git fetch' is even faster, even for people who aren't close
enough to their mirror to fetch a full .gz kernel tarball in <5s.
Sam.
