Subject: [PATCH 2.6.12-rc1] cpusets special case GFP_ATOMIC allocs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Stringent enforcement of cpuset memory placement could cause
the kernel to panic on a GFP_ATOMIC (!wait) memory allocation,
even though memory was available elsewhere in the system.
Relax the cpuset constraint, on the last zone loop in
mm/page_alloc.c:__alloc_pages(), for ATOMIC requests.

+There is a second exception to the above.  GFP_ATOMIC requests are
+kernel internal allocations that must be satisfied, immediately.
+The kernel may panic if such a requested page is not allocated.
+If such a request cannot be satisfied within the cpusets allowed
+memory, then we relax the cpuset boundaries and allow any page in
+the system to satisfy a GFP_ATOMIC request.  It is better to violate
+the cpuset constraints than it is to panic the kernel.

 To start a new job that is to be contained within a cpuset, the steps are:
 
  1) mkdir /dev/cpuset
