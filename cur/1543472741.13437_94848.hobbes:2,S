We have been chasing a problem with our production servers and the SMC
Etherpower II cards and their drivers for a couple of months now.  The
cards are running at 10Mbit/sec and under intermediate to high-load
the driver/card will hang.  Upping and downing the interface once or
sometimes twice will free the card and it will resume operation.
We have been able to tickle the bug with both uni-processor and SMP
kernels in both the 2.0.35 and 2.0.36 kernels.  Note that the driver
version in 2.0.35 was the same as in 2.0.36 since I built the 2.0.35
kernels with updated drivers (v1.03) from Donald's site.  The 2.0.36
kernel does seem marginally more resistant to the problem.
This morning I was able to get an OOPS out of an SMP-2.0.36 kernel
when I was trying to revive a hung interface on one of our news
servers.  I am appending a piece from the syslog file which has all
the kernel errors which were generated when we were working on the
interface.  Below this I am inserting a diagnostic dump from the
epic-diag utilities that Donald has on his site.  I am not sure
whether this is useful to anyone other than Donald but I wanted to be
complete.
I have been able to reproduce this hang on two separate servers and on
three separate SMC cards.  At this point I am reasonably convinced
that we have a driver problem in the kernel.  An interesting
observation is that we have not been able to reproduce the hang with
non-SCSI kernels.  An IDE based machine with the same card plugged
into the same hub has never offerred to hang.  This may not be
completely valid since the IDE based machine has only a single card
while the SCSI machines have two SMC cards in them.  The cards are on
different interrupts so it shouldn't be an IRQ sharing problem.
The hang seems to involve the card being unable to handle receive
packet interrupts.  After a hang ifconfig reports n number of errors
and reports an identical n number of dropped packets on the interface.
The problem may also be secondary to  networks that have intermediate
to high collision rates.  I can expand on my findings there if anyone
is interested.
In the FWIW department I think that anyone needing absolutely
bulletproof network connections would have to not use the SMC
Etherpower II cards at this point until the problem can be tracked
down.
