the common case is that the previous process is not runnable. Thus the
following condition: 
        if ((prev->state == TASK_RUNNING) &&
                        (prev != idle_task(smp_processor_id())))
                reschedule_idle(prev);
_will fail_. prev->state != TASK_RUNNING in the common case. We will _not_
run reschedule_idle().
