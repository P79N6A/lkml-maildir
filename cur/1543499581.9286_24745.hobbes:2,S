x86
2 of the kernel are compiled with egcs of Redhat 5.2
1 Kernel is compiled with the egcs of redhat 6.0 (the kernel on the
internet server)
The 3 computers i mentioned are in 3 different networks
( the have nothing in common,  hub in one network, ciscos in the other ,
different companies )
connection where made from  (http, ping, ssh ..)
    1.  Linux (2.2) to server       (success and failure from different
providerrs (depends on the dynamic ip ??? ) ) (different people, me,
provider, and a friend)
    2.  Cisco router to server     (internal network -> failed at the
first time,  worked after some time  ??? ) (this connection was made by
my provider)
    3.  sun (solaris) to server     (internal network -> failed)
First time this bug came up in a small home network from a friend
(Kernel 2.1.132 at that time) . He couldn't read his emails. He uses the
cyrus imap server on the linux side an a NT-Workstation with Netscape.
We couldn't connect with telnet  or ping  though the machine was
running and everything seemed fine on the linux-side.
A Connection with another Windows 95 Client did work.
We thought this was a buggy network  card in  the Windows NT  machine at
that time
The network works again without changing the network card, we just
rebooted
all machines.
I will run the internet server for the next 20 Days...
(22 Days uptime for the internetserver before the bug occured)
So long
Dietmar
