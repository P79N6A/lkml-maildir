Which is fine by me.  I'm not using the md driver much on 2.4.1 at the
moment -- just testing to make sure that most of the things that I'll
use in the longer run are working.  Hence, pass on what I know of the
problem and what appears to fix it and hopefully get a bit of a review
by those buried deeper in the kernel than I am (have time to be)
at the moment (which you have aptly provided).
Thanks.
