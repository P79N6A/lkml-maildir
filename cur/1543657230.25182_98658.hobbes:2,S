PLEASE don't send me patches like this.
The "bk send" stuff is totally unusable anyway, and it is made doubly so 
when you send BK patches that aren't even based on my tree, but have some 
other BK stuff before them, so that BK can't even take it due to missing 
parents.
Either make a real BK tree available for pulling (a _clean_ one, see the
docs), or just send real patches with no sign of BK. None of this
half-baked "bk send" crap.
Larry should never have made "bk send" available in the first place, it's 
an abomination.
