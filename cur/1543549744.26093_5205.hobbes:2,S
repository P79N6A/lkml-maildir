great! I'm happy we have a fine-tuned elevator again.

yep. But i dont understand why this makes any difference - the waitqueue
wakeup is FIFO, so any other request will eventually arrive. Could you
explain this bug a bit better?

cleaned up and the remaining bugs / performance problems are eliminated -
the first reports about bad write performance came right after the
original elevator patches went in, about 6 months ago.
