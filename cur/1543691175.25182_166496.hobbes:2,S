As to the mouse, i8042 wont survice suspend. Its a bit tricky
but reloading the module works. 
However I was unable to convince modprobe to load i8042 so it 
won't work before rc.sysinit runs.
1) You can use the little patch below
--- linux-2.6.0-test4-Vanilla/drivers/input/serio/Kconfig       2003-09-05 18:07:10.000000000 +0800
+++ linux-2.6.0-test5-mhf63/drivers/input/serio/Kconfig 2003-09-16 21:16:38.000000000 +0800

          as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
 config SERIO_I8042
-       tristate "i8042 PC Keyboard controller" if EMBEDDED || !X86
+       tristate "i8042 PC Keyboard controller"
        default y
        depends on SERIO
        ---help---
2) Config i8042 as a module in input device support
  CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=m
3) Add near top of rc.sysinit
  modprobe i8042
4) In your script Note you must use a script because once you
remove the module so goes the keyboard ;)
rmmod i8042
echo -n mem > /sys/power/state
modprobe i8042
As to the NIC, I suspect PCI interrupt links die.
  Note the output of /proc/interrupts _before_ and _after_
  suspend. 
  I expect the interrupts not to increase after suspend.
If other devices connected to PCI such as PCMCIA or USB (sound ?)
have trouble after suspend _and_ reloading the module does not 
work, this is the likely cause.

Michael
