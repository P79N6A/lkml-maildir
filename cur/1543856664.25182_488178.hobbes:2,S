Could you generalize the reciprocal thingy so that the division 
can be used from other parts of the kernel as well? It would be useful to 
separately get some cycle counts on a regular division compared with your 
division. If that shows benefit then we may think about using it in the 
kernel. I am a bit surprised that this is still an issue on modern cpus.
