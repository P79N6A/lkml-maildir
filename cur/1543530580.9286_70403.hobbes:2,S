This is not the case at all.
Network cards, and tulip in particular, are such a mess that ANY large
driver update is likely to break more cases than it fixes, generally. 
It is simply impossible for Donald to have enough feedback in isolation,
compared to the amount of feedback and testing given to kernels in the
regular Linus tree -- even the development series.
Further, if there is ANY problem after the huge driver update, it is
much more difficult to isolate problems.
