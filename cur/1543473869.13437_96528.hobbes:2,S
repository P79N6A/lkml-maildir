No.
The system exists because the Internet (not commonly available
before the early 1990's) allows collaborative development.
Linux might have died under the original licence, but BSD escaped
from AT&T with plenty of tools and most of a kernel. We'd be
using that now instead.
My system is i386-redhat-linux or just Linux. It is quite arrogant
for the FSF to call it otherwise. Not many people respect a person
who tries to claim credit for everything like you do.
Because of this, I refuse to ever mention any of the GNU and FSF
issues to anybody learning about the system. You don't even deserve
to be mentioned anymore. When I see i386-redhat-linux on all the
FSF stuff I compile, I will reconsider that decision. Until then,
I hope others will join me in ignoring you as punishment.
