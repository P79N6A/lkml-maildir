Hi,

probably not.  Not having sysfs mounted can cause hotplug to fail,
but I think not having /proc/bus/usb mounted shouldn't cause any
trouble nowadays.

The * means that this altsetting is being used - this is the altsetting
when using isochronous mode.  So it looks to me like isochronous mode is
being used.

Most likely it is using isochronous transfer.  The question then is: why
is it slow?  I will look in my cupboard to see if I have the same modem,
and if so see what speed I can get out of it.

Something like this IIRC:
	echo 7 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
Then it should turn up in dmesg.
Ciao,
Duncan.
