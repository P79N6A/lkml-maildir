Hi Folks,
with the latest 2.6.1-bk5 I got the following error:
	In file included from drivers/net/net_init.c:53:
	include/net/neighbour.h:216: error: parse error before "proc_handler"
	include/net/neighbour.h:216: warning: function declaration isn't a prototype
Looking for the reason it seems that I have to enable CONFIG_SYSCTL to
make this compile. The following patch introduces this problem:
	ChangeSet@1.1474.82.35, 2004-01-15 00:58:20-08:00, mashirle@us.ibm.com
	  [IPV6]: Implement MIB:ipv6InterfaceTable
Regards
Marcel
