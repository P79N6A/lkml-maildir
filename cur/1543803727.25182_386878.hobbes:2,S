See if this patch doesn't resolve the issue. Its a bit hackish, but
basically I'm just holding off installing any clocksources until later
on at boot. This avoids some of the clocksource churn.
You will still see the TSC be installed briefly, since in this cases it
doesn't realize its a bad choice until after its being used for one
interval. However it should be much shorter (only ~50ms) of a window.
thanks
