So why didn't you -test- the theory before suggesting it. It btw goes beyond
Libc4. Currently we have almost 100% compatibility back to libc 2.2.2. The
dated libc before that doesn't work because we dropped some very very
early obscure versions of a few syscalls.
Is it too much to ask that you go and look through the syscall tables of
old and new kernels ?
