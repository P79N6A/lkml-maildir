It was fabulous at that time. The first time you create a file, it gets ";1"
appended to it's filename. When you edit it, it gets saved under the same name,
this time appended by ";2". Edit it again... whell, you get the picture.
Cleaning up was as simple as "$ PURGE /KEEP=3" to keep the last three versions.
For these days with sometimes hundreds of files, it might become confusing when
'ls' shows all versions of all files, but back then it worked well.
