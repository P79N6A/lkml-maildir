That is the ideal goal, I think. But while our allocator offers higher
order allocations, we *should* be a bit smarter about them.

Yep. As you see I've already corrected myself a couple of times :\
RFC only at this stage.

Yep. Kswapd will not care about 4-order allocations unless someone does
a wake_kswapd(order 4);
We could get into a situation where kswapd free smore than required, but
if you've got someone regularly allocating 4-order pages, it probably
isn't *that* dumb to free one or two more.
If we complete an entire balance_pgdat round without freeing the required
pages, that kswapd_max_order gets reset to zero anyway...
