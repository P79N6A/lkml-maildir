Probably a dumb question, but I have a MIPS-based system that I'm
running Linux on, and when moving from 2.4.10 kernel to 2.4.16 kernel,
the # of characters per second on the serial console has dropped
significantly. 
The serial port used is a 16450 clone (it's built in to the processor,
so no, I can't upgrade it). It's programmed to run at 9600 baud, 8N1.
There's clearly no problem with the characters themselves. But while I
can push ~1000 CPS under 2.4.10, I can only push ~100 CPS under
2.4.16. I've noticed that the CPS of the console is constant in
2.4.16, regardless of serial port speed. 
Can anyone lend any insight into why I would've lost 90% of my serial
port throughput moving between these two revs of the kernel?
