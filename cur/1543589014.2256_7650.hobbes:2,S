CMPXCHG ought to make things better by avoiding the XADD(+1)/XADD(-1) loop,
however, I tried various combinations and XADD beats CMPXCHG significantly.
Here's a quote from Borland assembler manual I managed to dig out, giving i486
timings on memory access:
       ADDL/SUBL	3 cycles
       XADDL		4 cycles
       CMPXCHG		8 cycles (success) / 10 cycles (failure)
       LOCK		+1 cycle minimum on this CPU
In reality, however, XADDL gives at least as good a result as ADDL/SUBL, maybe
just a little bit better, but its hard to say. However, the penalty imposed on
the other CPU (when it has to flush it's cache) probably more than makes up
for the difference.

	MOVL $1,EDX
	SUBL EDX,(EAX)
Works out faster than:
	SUBL $1,(EAX)
as well... probably due to an avoided stall when the instruction before the
snippet loads EAX from memory. Oh yes... "STC, SUBL" may also be faster too.

No, not till this evening now, I'm afraid.
As for real-world benchmarks, I suspect the fastpath is going to be
sufficiently few cycles that it's drowned out by whatever bit of code is
actually using it, like my Wine server module, which is where all this started
for me.
