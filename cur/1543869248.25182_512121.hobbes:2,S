Another fundamental misconception.  Kernel AIO is not for servers.
One programmer in a hundred is working on a server codebase, and one
in a thousand dares to touch server plumbing.  Kernel AIO is for
clients, especially when mated to GUIs with an event delivery
mechanism.  Ask yourself why the one and only thing that Windows NT
has ever gotten right about networking is I/O completion ports.
