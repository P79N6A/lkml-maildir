Most servers are designed for low latency. A lot of them sleep a lot,
and a fair number of them also go poking around the kernel variables
in /proc (which exists precisely in order to export internal kernel
variables to userspace programs). I'll bet even your average Oracle
database application fits those criteria.
Echo made sense to move into the kernel because in addition to the above
it is a required feature on all Internet hosts, is pretty much stateless
(and/or depends only on internal IP stack state), and needs extra low
latency because it is designed to be used for timing purposes by
clients.
The same criteria hardly apply to identd.
