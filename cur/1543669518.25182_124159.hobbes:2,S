And far longer than that. People seem to be testing and demoing 
crazy things like SATA attached scanners, printers and even enclosure
services.
ide_scsi for 2.5 is about item 5000 on my list of things I care about.
The core reset code is now close to right (one race I don't understand)
so it should be possible to fix the 2.5 ide-scsi code (maybe by porting
the perfectly workable 2.4 code again 8))
