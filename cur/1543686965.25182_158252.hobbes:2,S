Which could have strange effects, if not put in a scheduler class
unreachable by the normal user or be at least a compile-out option.
That's why I didn't even considered solving it in the kernel
scheduler and basically suggested rolling the scheduling of this
special case your own ;-)

So you are on a quest for the holy grail of the real time people.
Do them a favor and write at least a paper about how you solved
this and I'll have even more good arguments (pro Linux) for my
new employer.

Now I completely understand your problem. Does it also arise, if
your application is alone on the machine? If it doesn't then you
are just hit by the bad programming of other people.

You can't guarantee that, if you are not higher priority AND in
the realtime scheduler class (which you like to avoid, as seen
below). There are other applications, which
might want to run, even you are busy.
stupid example:
   Consider syslogd logging loads of your debugging messages,
   because if you debug your application like this you generate
   most debugging messages, if you are really busy.

1. and 2. seem to contradict in practise :-(

It helps a lot, since you want these signals to have SIG_DFL
handlers an thus they'll never reach user space. This could be
made a fast path, if your usage pattern gets its lobby.
And if the VM pages, you better not interfere, since you have not
enough knowledge about the overall system state to interfere. If
it becomes a problem, better fix the VM for low latency. The
audio people will kiss your feet for that.

This doesn't matter, since the thread will immediately block, if
there is no work to do. But I would still prefer a timeout here
to determine 'blocks too long' with this solution, to avoid even
the context switch, when it's not necessary.

Thats my 'work indicator'. My problem with this solution is that
this activation is non-sense, if you go asleep most of the time.
I timer will prevent exactly this, but will limit throughput as
you added.

That is the perfect solution of your problem. You tell the kernel
your priorities within the application and forget all the hacks
we talked about.
Problem: This scheduler is more complex.
Solution: With a distinction between the group and the members of
   a group, where both can be set through syscalls would simplify
   it a lot and provide most things we want.
   Group can be either thread pool or process pool, with
   explicitly set members.
   Unfortunatly I neither have the time, nor the problem, nor the
   machines to implement this.
   Con? Ingo?
