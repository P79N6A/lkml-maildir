Some parts of the kernel (eg. the VFS or the device driver
layers) can already do that, while others still have layering
violations.
I suspect that the least destabilising way of moving to a
more modular model would be to gradually clean up the layering
violations in the rest of the code, until things are modular.
Yes, I know it's a lot of work ...
