I sure will. My plain Asus P2L97-DS with plain PII 333 SMP, plain Intel 440 
LX, plain Soundblaster Live, plain 3Com 3C905C and plain Matrox G400 has no 
trouble at all with 2.4 kernels, all IRQ lines claimed succesfully. With 
recent 2.5 kernels it is simply: IDW ! No fancy strange laptop, no "made in 
antarctica" chipset, only a SMP configuration on one of the most used 
chipsets in the world, and yes, I enabled MPS 1.4 support for I had trouble 
with shared IRQs. (FWIW: MPS 1.4 also reroutes interrupts)
