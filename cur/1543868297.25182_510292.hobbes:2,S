Why would I post it to a list where it's off-topic by list name? And how 
would anyone know that the list name can be ignored when so many other 
lists with "devel" in the name tell people with user questions to go 
elsewhere? Right now only users who ignore list names would even look there.
I was suggesting to improve user participation, since you don't think 
that's needed I'll stop trying to help. I guess since kvm needs more 
hardware you have fewer users and don't need user support list like xen.
