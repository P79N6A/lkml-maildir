Historical aside: this was pretty much _exactly_ the bug that we used to
have in the old style timer tick profiler: it was impossible to figure out 
what the "profile shift" value was. So you got a series of "unsigned int" 
counts, but you didn't know what the granularity was for the hit counting.
That was fixed by just making read_profile() return the sample step size 
as the first word. See
	fs/proc/proc_misc.c: read_profile()
and note the small 
        while (p < sizeof(unsigned int) && count > 0) {
                put_user(*((char *)(&sample_step)+p),buf);
                buf++; p++; count--; read++;
        }
loop (and a few "+1" things for adjusting size comparisons).
