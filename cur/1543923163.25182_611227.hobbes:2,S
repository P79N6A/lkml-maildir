Hello,
After booting 2.6.24-rc1 on my home machine I lost onboard rtl8111b
network card. It is neither functional nor even visible by lspci
anymore.
Moreover rebooting to previous 2.6.23-rc9 didn't fix it - card was
still not available.
This is  ASRock ALiveXFire-eSATA2 motherboard. I know about at least
one identical incident (person is in cc:) with the same motherboard.
.config, dmesg, output of dmidecode and lspci -v (after the incident)
are attached.
