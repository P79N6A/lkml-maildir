I would like to propose to generalize the idea of ingo MOLNAR.
In his patch, he created a /proc/fs/kernel/max-thread. 
The value returned is the current max number of tasks, let say, 
NR_TASKS (or DEFAULT_MAX_THREADS in his patch). 
I think it is a good idea and could be generalized to standard 
kernel.
So procps utilities could open this "file" to read the current
NR_TASK and malloc the internal table with to the right size.
This will improve procps tools and make them really "exportable".
Agree?
