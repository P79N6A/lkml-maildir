There was only one so far, but I will send more, in case I get any.

Ext2fs.

No, just defaults.

No: 2x P3 1 GHz, a standard platform we use for many services.

Dreaderd is not compiled with AIO enabled, but it does use mmap(),
madvise() and SYSV shared memory segments.

I will run the same setup on a different machine of same type, no problem.
In the mean time, I keep an eye on the machine that generated the oops.
