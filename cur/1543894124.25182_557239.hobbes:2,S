A court deposition if somebody tries to do relicensing.  At that point
I believe that I made myself sufficiently clear, so I really doubt that
"all files without explicit license get the license defendant would like
and not the one located in the tree" would fly.  But you are welcome to
test that, of course - will make for nice punitive damages.  Just make
sure to test it yourself - giving somebody else an advice that will land
them in trouble is not nice...
