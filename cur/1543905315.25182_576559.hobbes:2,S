Anything playing with power management needs to be aware of the 
limitations of the hardware. Many devices have reduced functionality 
when in reduced power states, and it's vital that the caller be aware of 
that. There's no way to express that information in a consistent way 
because the limitations vary widely between different types of device. 
So, given that software will need to be aware of the different special 
cases for different types of hardware, there's very little cost to each 
of them exposing a different interface.
