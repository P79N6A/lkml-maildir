True; raw I/O won't magically increase resources.  But it offers
a valuable way to tell the kernel something it can't know/infer: a good
buffering policy for streaming data.  The existing cache mechanism
for normal I/O works fine but is inappropriate for this case; indeed
perfectly good working sets are messed up by buffering the streaming data,
as Benno points out.
Cheers,
