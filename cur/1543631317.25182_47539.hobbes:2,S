	Alan,
	Could you be more precise and point out which kernel start
failing ?
	David,
	If I remember properly my debug session with Alan (that was a
long while ago), the COR reset was screwing up the firmware (well, how
many time did I told you to not make it mandatory ?).
	Alan has an old Compaq card (the Intersil PrismII variety, not
the new Lucent one) and his firmware is probably not very fresh.
	Good luck...
	Jean
