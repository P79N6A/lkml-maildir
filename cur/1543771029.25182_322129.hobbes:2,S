Please have a look at RTAI-fusion. It provides deterministic
replacements for rt-able syscalls _transparently_ to STANDARD
Linux applications. For example, an unmodified Linux application
can get a deterministic nanosleep() via RTAI-fusion. The way
this works, is that rtai-fusion catches the syscalls prior to
them reaching Linux. So even the syscall thing isn't really a
limitation for RTAI anymore.
Philippe would be in a better position to elaborate, but that's
the essentials of it.
