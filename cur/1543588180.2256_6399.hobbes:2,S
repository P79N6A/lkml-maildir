I don't want nor need file permissions.  A program would look like this:
  process 1:
   fd = open("somefile")
   addr = mmap(fd);
   pthread_mutexattr_init(&attr);
   pthread_mutexattr_setpshared(&attr, PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED);
   pthread_mutex_init ((pthread_mutex_t *) addr, &attr);
   pthread_mutex_lock ((pthread_mutex_t *) addr);
   pthread_mutex_destroy((pthread_mutex_t *) addr);
  process 2:
   fd = open("somefile")
   addr = mmap(fd);
   pthread_mutex_lock ((pthread_mutex_t *) addr);
The shared mem segment can be retrieved in whatever way.  The mutex in
this case is anonymous.  Everybody who has access to the shared mem
*must* have access to the mutex.
For semaphores it looks similarly.  First the anonymous case:
 process 1:
   fd = open("somefile")
   addr = mmap(fd);
   sem_init ((sem_t *) addr, 1, 10);	// 10 is arbitrary
   sem_wait ((sem_t *) addr);
   sem_destroy((sem_t *) addr);
  process 2:
   fd = open("somefile")
   addr = mmap(fd);
   sem_wait ((sem_t *) addr);
Note that POSIX semaphores could be implemented with global POSIX
mutexes.
Finally, named semaphores:
   semp = sem_open("somefile", O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0600)
   sem_wait (semp);
   sem_close(semp);
   sem_unlink(semp);
This is the only semaphore kind which maps nicely to a pipe or socket.
All the others don't.  And even for named semaphores it is best to
have a separate name space like the shmfs.
> So you have unix file permissions on them ?
See above.  Permissions are only allowed for named semaphores.
