Mmm.. according to that document, the "dynamic wear leveling" devices
might benefit from having Linux issue CF-Erase commands to unallocated sectors,
so that the onboard CF controller can then add those sectors to the wear-leveling
rotation scheme.
There was discussion at LSF'08 about possible filesystem hooks that could
be used for this (and other) purposes when deleting files.
Cheers
