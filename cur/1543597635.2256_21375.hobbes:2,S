	The attached piece of script kiddie shit is the first one that worked
flawlessly on my Mandrake box :((( ( kernel 2.4.7ac2, glibc-2.2.3 ),
instant root access !!!.
	I was stunned, and it seem that is the beginning of a Linux Code Red
lookalike worm :(((( using that exploit, probably this is not the most
apropriate place to send this, but I'm not subscribed to the glibc
mailing list and I just hope that some glibc hackers are on linux kernel
list also and they see that and do something before we join the ranks of
M$.
		Dead worried,

P.S. Please tell me that I'm just being parnoid and that crap didn't
work on your systems with a lookalike configuration.[unhandled content-type:application/x-sh]
