If you *really* want to allow chains (note that the above could be 
prolly be hosted on a real thread, once chains becomes that long), then 
try to build that chain with the current API, and compare it with:
long my_clet(ctx *c) {
	int fd, error = -1;
	if ((fd = socket(...)) == -1 ||
	    bind(fd, &c->laddr, sizeof(c->laddr)) ||
	    connect(fd, &c->saddr, sizeof(c->saddr)) ||
	    sendmsg(fd, ...) == -1 ||
	    recv(fd, ...) <= 0)
		goto
	error = 0;
erxit:
	close(fd);
	return error;
}
Points:
- Keep the submission API to submit one or an array of parallel async 
  syscalls/clets
- Keep arguments of the syscall being longs (no need for extra pointer 
  indirection compat code, and special copy_atoms functions)
- No need for the "next" atom pointer chaining (nice for compat too)
- No need to create special conditions/jump interpreters into the kernel 
  (nice for compat and emulators). C->machine-code that that for us
- Easier to code. Try to build a chain like that with the current API and 
  you will see what I saying
- Did I say faster? Machine code is faster than sudo-VM interpretation of 
  jumps/conditions done inside the kernel
