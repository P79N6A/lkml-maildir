I didn't see these reported yet:
I'm having some build issues with the 2.3.13 pre-patches.
With -2, make xconfig breaks.
With -2, APM generates compile-time errors.
I've reversed the patches, and 2.3.12 builds just fine, albeit with warnings:
apm.c:295: warning: `regparm' attribute directive ignored
apm.c: In function `apm_get_info':
apm.c:1187: warning: unused variable `nbat'
apm.c: At top level:
apm.c:607: warning: `apm_get_battery_status' defined but not used
I'm also having some sound (as modules) problems:
drivers/char/char.a(msp3400.o): In function `msp3400c_init':
msp3400.o(.text+0x1fe2): undefined reference to `register_sound_mixer'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
I think I'm doing something stupid there, though (it happens in 2.3.12 also).
