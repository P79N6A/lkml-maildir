Two things I am noticing with 2.3.20 pre2 on IA32, VIA VP4-686
motherboard:
* Boot process locks up, on an RH 6.0 machine, when it hits the script
which sets the clock time.  Ctrl-Alt-Del and SysRq do not work.
After this lockup was verified to be consistent, I rebuilt with a
stripped down kernel image, removing APM and/or ACPI and a few other
things.  Machine booted and ran ok, except for one little quirk:
* idle machine load average is 1.00.  top doesn't show any active
processes, and disks are idle.
Now, I _think_ that ACPI and/or APM is to blame for this lockup, but I
have not confirmed that yet, as I have not compared the working and
non-working .config files.
