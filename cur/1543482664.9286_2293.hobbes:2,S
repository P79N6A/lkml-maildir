Hopefully, yes.

No, but there are some problems to be aware of: in particular, glibc
does not cope entirely gracefully with large numbers of fds.
Specifically, rpc breaks if you increase the open-files rlimits, and you
will need to define your own, larger fd_set structures if you want to
use select on fds above 1024.  
Other than that, it should work fine (and I have had test code running
both poll and select on 10000 fds with no problems).  Obviously it has
had less testing than the existing code, but the large fdset bits have
been in all of the recent *ac kernels without causing any known
problems.
