Judging by the pci ids database it's either an AMD Unknown or AMD Opus 
chipset.
hdparm says DMA is enabled (it's enabled by a script a bootup AFAIK).
Installing smartd seems to have helped a lot - it's jumped to 28MB/32MB 
which is a hell of a lot closer to what I was expecting (not sure if 
ATA133 should give 133MB a second or whether that's just a theoretical 
limit).
Not sure why enabling smart would help that much (I'm still working my 
way around the BIOS settings and the way to enable it was far from 
obvious - you have to do a manual config of the hard drive first).
