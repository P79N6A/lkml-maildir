Hi Jeff,
Thanks for your confidence, but that would be a considerably bigger patch.  
It's not just a matter of removing the includes - other bits and pieces have 
to be put in place, such as per-filesystem inode slab.  The support for this 
goes outside ext2.
My idea is to just let people have a look and test this minimally intrusive 
change.  Getting rid of the includes for ext2 inodes will be a two-patch 
change:
  1) Abstract away the ext2 .u's (done)
  2) Per-fs inode slab, initially only for ext2 (partly done)
Removing the includes for ext2 superblocks will need another two patches.  By 
the time all filesystems are done, it would be thousands of lines if it was 
all in one patch.  I think it's better to keep it broken up, and do it 
incrementally.
