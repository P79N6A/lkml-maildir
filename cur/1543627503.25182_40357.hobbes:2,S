Hi, I have a HighPoint RocketRAID 133 with HPT372A chipset. 
(firmware revision is 2.31)
My currect kernel version is 2.4.19-pre5-ac3, this version contains 
HighPoint "366", "366",  "368", "370", "370A", "372", "374" support.
When booting with this kernel I get "hde lost interrupt",  I tried
hacking the ide drivers myself a little. Now, it works without DMA
support, I submit my patch to linux kernel mailing list. here is the
patch http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101848841720406&w=2
I still trying to improve on DMA support. Can you offer me 
any help ? ex. data sheet, manual, driver source code, etc ? 
Best Regards,
