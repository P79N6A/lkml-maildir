because you are not using NMI based profiling?

that's just the profiling interrupt hitting them. You should not analyze 
irq-safe code with a non-NMI profiling interrupt.
CLI/STI is extremely fast. (In fact in the -rt tree i'm using them 
within mutexes instead of preempt_enable()/preempt_disable(), because 
they are faster and generate less register side-effect.)
