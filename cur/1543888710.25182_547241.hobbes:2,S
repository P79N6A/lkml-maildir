See commit log:
Booting a SMP kernel with maxcpus=1 on a SMP system leads to a hard
hang, because ACPI ignores the maxcpus setting and sends timer broadcast
info for the offline CPUs. This results in a stuck for ever call to
smp_call_function_single() on an offline CPU.
The irq 9 issue is a separate problem and only surfaces on some boxen,
but it's not related to this patch. It's related to maxcpus=1 as well.
