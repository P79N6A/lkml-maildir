Well, pointer arithmetic on the HPPA isn't simple 2's complement due to
the way implicit space register selection works.
For example in an unscaled indexed addressing mode like
ldbx  srcreg1(srcreg2), dstreg
Is not equivalent to
ldbx srcreg2(srcreg1), dstreg
ie x + y != y + x for computing an address in a memory operation.
For the same reason computing an address outside of an object into a 
register, then using a displacement in a memory operation to generate an
address that is within the bounds of the object may not work.  ie, you
can't do something like this and expect it to work:
int a[10];
int *z = a - 10;
foo()
{
  return z[10];
}
And before anyone says the PA is unbelievably strange and nobody else would
make the same mistakes -- the mn10300 (for which a linux port does exist)
has the same failings.
