Oddly enough, sparse_add_one_section() doesn't seem to like to check
its allocations.  The usemap is checked, but not freed on error.  If you
want to fix this up, I think it needs a little more love than just two
lines.  
Do you want to try to add some actual error handling to
sparse_add_one_section()?
