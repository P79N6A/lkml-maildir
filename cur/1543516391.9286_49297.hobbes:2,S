2.2.x you get the value from the PCI registers. Its a copy of the BAR with flags
With 2.3.x you get told the start/end/size of each resource and if it is
I/O or memory. Resource objects are portable for all busses. Also they do the
things like 64bit using dual BAR's properly for you, and they can do magic
mappings as needed.
