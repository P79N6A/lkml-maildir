It does look like this patch was under discussion of being reverted 
before. See 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/26/183
The following comment still stands when we just revert Bjorn's change:

So perhaps the best solution is a combination of reverting Bjorn's 
patch, adding Linus' suggested change, and adding my southbridge hack.
