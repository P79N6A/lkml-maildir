How is it more powerful? The next step in introducing such API is that 
people start complaining, they don't get ms precision, which of course is 
fixed by the next patch, with then results in that the whole timer system 
becomes more complex for a few misguided users.
Keep the thing as simple as possible and jiffies _are_ simple. Please show 
me the problem, that needs to be fixed.
bye, Roman
