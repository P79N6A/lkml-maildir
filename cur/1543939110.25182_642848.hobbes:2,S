Hrm, I don't know why checkpatch does not notice the problem when
invoked with your command, but creating a patch with your change results
in :
compudj@dijkstra:~/git/morestable/linux-2.6-lttng.mm$ scripts/checkpatch.pl patches/test.patch 
ERROR: need a space before the open brace '{'
#27: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:426:
+#define INIT_ARRAY(type, val, len) ((type[]){[0 ... (len)-1] = (val)})
total: 1 errors, 0 warnings, 6 lines checked
Your patch has style problems, please review.  If any of these errors
are false positives report them to the maintainer, see
CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
but I guess we are deep down in nitpicking land ;)
Cheers,
Mathieu
