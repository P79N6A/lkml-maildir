I'm currently investigating the old non-overcommit patch, which (apart from
needing manual applying to recent kernels) appears to be rather broken in a
trivial way.  It prevents allocation if total reserved memory is greater
than the total unallocated memory.  Let me say that again, a different way
- it prevents memory usage from exceeding 50%...
Is there a fast way of getting total VM size?  Eg. equivalent to the
following code:
si_meminfo(&i);
si_swapinfo(&i);
free = i.totalram + i.totalswap;
If not, I have to do some jiggery to keep good performance along with true
non-overcommittance.
