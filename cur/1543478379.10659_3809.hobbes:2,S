[cc'ed to mozilla's nspr mailing list. it may not be 100% on-topic there,
because the bug has only be shown with ns4.x so far, but there are good
chances that mozilla has similar problems, so I hope it is ok]

I have the same problems with navigator 4.5/glibc with 2.2.0pre7.

I looked at the Mozilla nspr source, and it seems that SIGALRM handler
is used to schedule the NSPR user level threads.

In the nspr3.0 sources all pipe reading seems to be protected by 
if (_PR_IS_NATIVE_THREAD_SUPPORTED()) .., but maybe that is different
in the NSPR version netscape 4.x uses.

At least the nspr 3.0 version I am looking at sets the pipe to non 
blocking (in pr/src/md/unix/unix.c:_MD_InitCPUS())

A binary search to find the exact version where it broke would be
very helpful.

Not surprising, strace changes signal timing.
