Yes, the problem is that in scsi_register_host() if there are no upper
level drivers - the standard case if building no modules - we call
scsi_release_commandblocks even though we are NOT getting rid of
the scsi_device. So, with current code, new_queue_depth and
current_queue_depth are zero.
When we register upper level drivers in scsi_register_device(), we
call scsi_build_commandblocks (again), and get a queue depth of 1,
since we've cleared new_queue_depth.
(In many cases, for one device we call build command blocks twice, call
release command blocks, and then build command blocks again. Yuck)
Removing the scsi_release_commandblocks() in scsi_register_host()
would also fix the problem, and in most cases, would not waste any
space. In the worst case AFAICT it would waste one scsi_cmnd (about 300
or so bytes?).
I see no good reason to zero new_queue_depth in scsi_release_commandblocks,
as new_queue_depth is the desired queue depth, and should remain so until
scsi_adjust_queue_depth is called. Setting new_queue_depth to zero means
we have to call slave_attach again to set it right, and depending on what
else an adapter slave_attach does could be very wrong.
