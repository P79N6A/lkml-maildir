Hmm, thanks -- I hadn't thought of doing that.
Of course, calling printf makes it big again, but that's no real surprise
(and it's still not as big as before).  I'm pleased to see that write(),
for example, doesn't increase the size much at all.
It seems prudent to call _exit() in exit() and abort() rather than do
absolutely nothing, though; this avoids a segfault at shutdown if you
actually do any work in main().
Have fun,
Avery
