The driver for this thing isn't even in beta yet.

I must admit that I made a typo in the config file and thus currently
use the lower case ttysr instead of the ttySR names. Sorry about
that. Those are internal use here only ok? I'll make sure that the
config file "ttySR%d" gets distributed.
While we're at it, may I ask you to swap major 155 and 156? That way
the 9 minor bits are contiguous.
	my_minor = MINOR(dev)+ 256 * (MAJOR(dev)&1);
instead of the not-working, non-obvious:
	my_minor = MINOR(dev)+ 128 * (MAJOR(dev)&2);
Best regards, 
			Roger.
