Subject: 2.3.42 + Tulip Lockup (maybe SMP)

I have just taken the 2.3.x plunge and have found my machine to work all
except the Tulip driver.
I am running Redhat 6.1 and it says "Delaying eth0 initialization" on
boot.  If I "ifup eth0" it says the same thing.  I used to get this if I
didn't have the module loded / aliased in conf.modules.
conf.modules has the line
alias eth0 tulip
I decided to insmod the module to see what would happen.  It insmoded fine
so I figured I'd bring it up "ifup eth0" What happened next...  here it
is...

Is there an easy way to copy this down!  Sheesh thats a lot of typing!
The Machine is:
2xPII 350mhz
128 Meg of PC100 ECC
American Micro P6DBU
New stuff turned on in kernel:
ACPI
USB (All Modular and not loaded at the time)
I2c (All Modular and not loaded at the time)
lm_sensors 2.4.5
Sensors (All Modular and not loaded at the time)
I have the config around if you need more info...
Other things I noticed:
Matroxfb (using matrox:vesa:0x11E) no longer works - drops to 640x480
	console
NTFS w/write support does not compile into kernel
