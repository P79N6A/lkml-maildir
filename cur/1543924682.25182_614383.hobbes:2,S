If I had to do it from scratch today I would make the 32-bit entry
point require a stack, segments and use C calling conventions to pass
struct boot_params *.
Besides %esi I'm not really fond of requiring anything in the 32bit
entrypoint.  At the same time I totally agree that it is always nice
to provide way more then you need.
