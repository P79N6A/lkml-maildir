fair enough, and i fixed that.
( i called the previous patch the "first step" because i was too chicken
  to pick a single granularity default :-/ )
for the current queue i went for settings close to that of HZ=250 - 
that's the most common HZ variant that was tested previously. That means 
10 msec on a 1-way box, 20 msec on a 2-way box, 30 msec on a 4-way box, 
etc. (up to a 100 msecs ceiling.)

ok, i've removed that and all the other HZ hacks too. I've uploaded a 
new queue with that fixed (and all other patches unchanged):
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
booted it on a number of boxes (32-bit and 64-bit). The question will be 
desktop behavior. I typically run my test-desktops with HZ=100 to make 
sure that desktop workloads are fine with large granularity values and 
coarse timers too, so i'm reasonably positive about this default.
We'll see - people can still readily tweak these values under 
CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y and give us feedback, and if there's enough demand 
for very-finegrained scheduling (throughput be damned), we could 
introduce yet another config option or enable the runtime tunable 
unconditionally. (Or maybe the best option is Peter Zijlstra's adaptive 
granularity idea, that gives the best of both worlds.)
