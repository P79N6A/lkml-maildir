Ok, I finally had a chance to work on this, and here's what I know:
1) I found a workload under which I was able to reliably make the
network on the machine die (a few hundred of the "eth0: card reports
no resources." errors showed up which continued until I took down the
network and removed the module).  Unfortunately, the workload was with
an in-house app, so all I can describe are the conditions associated
with it: 2 processes with a total of about 600 threads, 1.5gb of
memory, about 500 network connections, and a lot of disk and network
I/O. 
2) I switched from using the eepro100 module to using intel's e100
module, and I was unable to reproduce the problem, even under a
heavier load than before.  Haven't seen so much as a peep about eth0
problems in the logs since I switched over.
So for now, I'll be sticking with the e100 driver, since it appears to
have solved my problem (at least for now).
