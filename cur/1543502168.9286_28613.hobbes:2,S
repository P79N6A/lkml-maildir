at the moment, I use the 0x9 code which makes the bios do some very little
hardware initialization and does a RETF from a stack passed by my program.

I've found only one case in which it would be interesting to try to recover,
it's when the user sees his host going down, and first wants to get the dump,
and after that, he'd like to try to unmount his filesystems, but... it's too
late. People must know well that by pressing Alt-SysRq-D, they won't be able
to get back.

That was my problem, and that's why I have to redo most of the hardware init
at reset time. Moreover, I've noticed that under 2.3.5, my patches has some
trouble with floppies: I get an error 4 (sector not found) when trying to
read and/or write to them. I haven't verified yet, but would it be possible
that some memory has been intentionnaly modified by the kernel (eg: 0:0x78),
or should I investigate in other ways ?
Perhaps I'll put the new patch on my site this night :

It's still blue screen. If people find other interesting color
combinations, I'd like to know since some people said that microsoft could say
"linux has a blue screen too !". Rumour says that they now want to let the
user configure his blue screen and even let resellers put their advertisements
in it ... At least, it's a good place for such a thing, it displays so often :-)
