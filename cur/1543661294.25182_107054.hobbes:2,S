I dont know.  A guy I used to work with at a Major insurance company in
Denver Colorado saw the BSOD one day.  From about 30 feet away he
stopped, looked at it and then me.  "You know, I thought you were
running windows for a second but then realized the font was wrong..."
He was very serious.
Thus spake Jeff Garzik (jgarzik@pobox.com):
