As already said, 2.6.22.1-cfs-v19 includes the patch and 
2.6.21.6-cfs-v19 does not include it.
But both suffer of the problem.
I now reversed the patch on 2.6.22.1-cfs-v19 but it does not help.
2.6.22-git15 is not working as well... so the problem did not magically 
disappear like the processes.
Any further things I can do to track it down? (I go on vacation on 
monday for two weeks, but just send them, I'll try them when I am back 
or answer the mails, when I dont need to build a new kernel...)
