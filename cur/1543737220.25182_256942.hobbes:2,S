(Hopefully this will work, I haven't posted to the LKML with this

This is one of two things.  First off, are you sure you're updating
the CMOS clock as part of your reboot process?  During initialization
the system reads the CMOS clock, so if you don't keep it updated the
time will always be incorrect.  You might want to look at the clock
from your BIOS to see what time it is.
The second issue is time zone.  Unless you have a dual boot system
this probably isn't an issue though.  If you have your CMOS clock set
to UTC and you use and unadulterated Windows then every time you boot
the other operating system your clock will be wrong.  Since you appear
to live in Italy though you shouldn't be at UTC +/- 6 hours, so this
is probably not the problem.
Hope this helps
Jay
