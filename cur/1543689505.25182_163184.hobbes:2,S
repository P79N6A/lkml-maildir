To be fair - for the hardware extant at the time - they were. Our 
drivers/ide/pci/generic.c is exactly that. Also beyond the PCI code the
vendors managed to create a standard that actually basically works and
is back compatible. Bits of it are rather Lovecraftian but it works. 
ide/pci/generic.c will drive almost any IDE controller today in BIOS
tuned mode including basic IDE DMA.

UHCI, OHCI, their reuse for firewire and other stuff are all great
examples. VGA is another example which alas fell apart as cards changed
over time. Its always struck me as bizarre that graphics card vendors
can create a chip that can texture a billion triangles a second but
can't manage to agree on a hardware interface where I load height,
width, depth and refresh rate and it sets it up for me.
I grant I2O proved that you can make that control layer too complicated.
Even then it wasn't the hardware interface that was the problem, it was
the glue on top. People still use the i2o hw interface for many things.
I'm hopeful now the world is effectively down to two scsi vendors
(Adaptec and LSI) we can at least begin to see a reduction in the number
of permutations of scsi insanity.
