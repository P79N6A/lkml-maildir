Well, then it is quite clear to me: you can build an OSS-like interface
on top of ALSA, but you cannot build an ALSA-like interface on top of
OSS. This implies that an ALSA-like interface should be in the kernel,
and an OSS-like interface should be implemented on top of it in
userspace for those who do not need all the features. This way both
camps are satisfied.
