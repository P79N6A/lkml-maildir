Eh, ok, I'm not really sure what you did...
You ran raidreconf once, and after the entire reconfiguration had run,
the kernel barfed.
Then what?  You re-ran the reconfiguration?  Same as before?
If so, then I can pretty much guarantee you that your data are lost. You
may get Ibas (ibas.no) to scrape off the upper layers of your disk
platters, run some pattern analysis on whats left, and possibly then
retrieve some of your old data, but that's about the only chance I can
see you having.
If you only ran raidreconf once, then there might still be a good chance
to get your data back.  To me it doesn't sound like this is the case,
but if it is, please let me know.
Sorry about your loss (but running an experimental raid reconfiguration
tool on an experimental kernel without backups, well...  ;)

Ok. It would be interesting to see if the oops goes away when preempt is
disabled.
