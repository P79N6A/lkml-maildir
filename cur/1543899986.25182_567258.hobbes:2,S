True.  But keep in mind that when POSIX was written mmap() was new and shiny 
and pretty much only used for shared mappings, and definitely not used by 
malloc().

Yes, probably.  But it got missed.

Given that RLIMIT_DATA is pretty much meaningless in current kernels, I would 
put forward the argument that this change is extremely unlikely to break 
anything because no one is currently setting it to anything other than 
unlimited.  Adding this feature would give administrators another tool, a way 
to control the private data size of a process without restricting its ability 
to attach to large shared mappings.

As I recall, this was added after Herbert discovered that exec_vm is not 
counted as shared_vm.  It's actually mapped as private/readonly.
