Because you may or may not need to ignore the received character!
When a break condition occurs which is not ignored by the termios
settings, you need to insert a TTY_BREAK indicator into the tty
received queue, so that the tty layers and userspace can do the
right thing.  There is the requirement for errors to be passed to
userspace if userspace has requested that behaviour.
However, if this is the serial console with sysrq support, then break
is masked by that and needs to be ignored.
