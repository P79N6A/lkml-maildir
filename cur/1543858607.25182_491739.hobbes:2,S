Probably should say so, then. As it is, the only way to figure that
out (other than loking at code (:)) is to infer it from the .emacs
example, which doesn't come until 8 chapters later in the document.
Maybe:
Outside of comments, documentation, and Kconfig, use TAB characters
for indentation. Spaces are never used for indentation, and the above
example is deliberately broken in several ways, including use of
spaces.
