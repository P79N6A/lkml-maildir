It's unlikely to be useful.  A journal abort will cause existing
transactions to be suspended midstream, so any errors afterwards may
be due to updates which were in progress at the time and which didn't
complete.  And since a fsck has been done, we've lost those errors
anyway.
Is the problem reproducible?  The basic

error is just ext3's normal reaction to a fatal error detected in the
filesystem, so that in itself isn't a worry.  The cause of the problem
it spotted is the worry; is this reproducible?
Cheers,
 Stephen
