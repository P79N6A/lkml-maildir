Hopefully you're using /lib64 for that, otherwise your
packages will be incompatible to everybody else and not 
FHS compliant. If you don't please don't submit any 
patches to hardcode this to upstream packages.

Not only the boot loaders, but the kernel needs a -m32
compilers/toolset to build the bzImage unpacker. There were some plans
to change that, but it hasn't happened so far.

kexec is essentially a 64bit boot loader, but you need
linux running before so it has a little bootstrap problem.
I believe the folks at 
http://www.codegen.com
 got one too, but
it's proprietary.
The problem is that there is currently no defined protocol
for passing data to the 64bit part of the kernel, so while
it would be possible to write a boot loader that starts
a 64bit kernel it would be very kernel version dependent.
