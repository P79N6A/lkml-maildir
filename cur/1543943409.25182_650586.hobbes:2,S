Hm, that was odd, Chris created that tree in a different way than
normal, which worked to push and pull from directly through ssh, but
didn't work through the gitweb interface.
It should be fixed now, but might take 30 minutes or so to propagate.
If within an hour, it's still not working, please let me know.
thanks,
