It is needed for having a kernel which can run both as a dom0 and domU
kernel.  For dom0, you want to build with CONFIG_VT enabled while for
domU, the CONFIG_VT code doesn't let the xen console be the primary
console unless you specify it on the command line.
I've removed this from the patchqueue since a kernel built from the
patchqueue won't run as a dom0 kernel anyway.

We have proper early_printk support but it's not part of the patchqueue.
This is more of a debug function where you would rename the kernel/printk
to something else and rename this to printk.  I've removed it.
