Just wondering, I have not checked. Isn't the "must fragment" message
supposed to embed part of the packet it couldn't send in return ? If
this is the case (and if the victim processes it correctly), it would
need to guess a recent valid content. If it's not the case, I suspect
it would simply update the path mtu in the route cache, thus giving
spectacular effects :-)
Cheers,
Willy
