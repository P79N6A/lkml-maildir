I guess you mean "3ware CLI (version 2.00.00.042+)"?
If this is meant to replace all the other versions on the website, then
the presentation is definitely "suboptimal", because the only way to get
there is to explicitly request "experimental" software for the "9000
series" which is kind of strange if you're just looking for basic
functionality for other controllers.
At least on my 8506-controllers there are also some minor problems (e.g.
"info" doesn't work during a verify) which I thought was due to the fact
that the program is intended exclusively for 9000-controllers.
