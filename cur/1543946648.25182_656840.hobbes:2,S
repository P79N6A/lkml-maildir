Hi,
I'm looking at 2.6.25-rc2.  vsyscall_sysctl_change contains code to NOP
out the actual system call instructions of the vsyscall page when
vsyscall64 is enabled.  This seems to interact badly with the fallback
code in do_vgettimeofday which tries to call gettimeofday if the
configured clock source does not support vread.  (In effect,
gettimeofday() becomes a nop and time() always returns 0.  Not very
useful.)
Is there a good reason to keep this?  Aren't the instructions in
question avoided (or invoked) according to the vsyscall64 flag by the
surrounding logic anyway?
