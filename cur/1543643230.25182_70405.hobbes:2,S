We hold vmalloced space for very short periods of time, in fact
filesystem recovery and large extended attributes are the only
cases. In this case we should be attempting to remap 2 pages
together. The only way out of this would be to fail the whole
mount at this point. I suspect a leak elsewhere.
Samuel, when you mounted xfs and it oopsed, was it shortly after bootup?
Also, how far did your dbench run get before it hung? I tried the
kernel, but I paniced during startup - then I realized I did not 
apply the patch to fix the xfs/scheduler interactions first.
How much memory is in the machine by the way? And Andrea, is the
vmalloc space size reduced in the 3G user space configuration?
