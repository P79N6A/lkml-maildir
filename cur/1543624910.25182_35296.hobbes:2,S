Subject: 2.5.7-pre2 link error in kernel.o with nfs but !nfsd configured
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

2.5.7-pre2 (am using bitkeeper version from linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5)
fails to link at the final stage of make bzImage.
The error is that sys_nfsservctl is referenced from kernel.o but it can't 
find it.
This error only occurs when NFS client side is configured and NFS server
side is not configured.
When both are configured make bzImage completes fine.
Best regards,
	Anton
