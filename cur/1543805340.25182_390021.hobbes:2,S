Well given that parts of the kernel are GPLv2-only, other parts are  
GPLv2+, other parts are GPL/BSD, etc, I can't see how somebody using  
a GPLv3-only or GPLv3+ license for some other part would be  
problematic.  If anything, the multiple licensing provides additional  
code protection; we get the advantages of all the licenses, but if  
any one license is found to be invalid, it does not break the  
protection of the body of code itself.
Cheers,
