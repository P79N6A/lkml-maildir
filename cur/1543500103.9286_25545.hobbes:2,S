Actually, no.  The over all goal of speakup is to make the entire
machine available to the visually impaired person from boot to
shut-off.  That is its long term goal anyway.  This is a question
which gets asked all the time.  Usually by people who don't really
understand the reasons for wanting/needing comparable access for all!
