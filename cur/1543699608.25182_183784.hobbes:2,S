I think you create a mess here. Other drivers have usable
API include files in /usr/include/linux, why are i2c.h and i2c-dev.h
special?
While I can understand why the ioctl wrappers have been removed
from the kernel include file i2c-dev.h I fail to see the logic
in having a different i2c-dev.h for userspace, or generally breaking
the kernel includes for userspace.
It seems to me that there is no package that I could install to make
the correct i2c-dev.h available for userspace programs, and the only
way to fix the DirectFB Matrox driver so it compiles with 2.4 and
2.6 kernel headers is to copy the correct i2c-dev.h into the
DirectFB source tree.
I think that sucks.
