Hi

So long as kernel IsaPnP works on this card in much the same way that isapnp
does (and there's no reason why it won't) then the changes look ok. 
Unfortunately I'm about a month away from having time (and a machine) to be
able to test this myself though :(.
Once I had a few things sorted out I was planning on adding the Isapnp stuff
myself - it looks like you've saved me the time though :).
Regards
