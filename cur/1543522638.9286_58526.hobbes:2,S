Hi!
I got practically identical oopses for rather long time with kernels
2.2.13,
2.2.14pre and 2.2.14. (single Pentium 200MMX, 64Mb)
Almost always this happened when XFree86 was started. Usually X died
after oopses.
I usually got about 20 oopses at once and had to enlarge printk buffer
size to 64K to get them all into log.
Currently I'm using for some days 2.2.15pre2 with patched kernel/sched.c
(2.2.15pre2) to add some additional test to del_from_runqueue()  (from
oopses I got I found that p->next_run==0) to get debugging output to try
to figure out the reason of this queue corruption. But I haven't get
more oopses yet.
