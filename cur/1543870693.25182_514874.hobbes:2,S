Some fubar machines do it in SMM mode, and the AML code just reads memory
regions that were updated by the SMBIOS.  Or, if one is lucky, the AML
triggers the SMI (ThinkPads do this, for example -- but I am not sure that's
the only way a ThinkPad will cause a SMI), so it could be made to run
protected by the lock.
