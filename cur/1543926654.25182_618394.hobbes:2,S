Actually, on re-checking the documentation, this particular board doesn't
appear to have a write-enable for the flash, but rather an access-enable
(which is obviously installed).  Furthermore, the probe does seem to manage to
work out that the chip is an MBM29LV800TA, so write is apparently possible.
So the problem appears to be something other than what I thought.
Without the patch, the kernel log shows:
