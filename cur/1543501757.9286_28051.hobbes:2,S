Well, root gets all the capabilities. You should need a capability to be
able to play with file generation numbers, and another to play with fsuid.
Being non-root is fine if you can get the capabilities some other way.
I don't see why the NFS server would need to _set_ the file generation
numbers. I'd guess it is broken. File generation numbers are used by
the NFS server and set by the filesystem code.
