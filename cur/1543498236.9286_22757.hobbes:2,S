Apologies for the off-topic nature of this post.
I'm trying to contact Colin Plumb, the author of the well-known
public-domain MD5 implementation, also involved in NTP and a variety
of crypto things, last seen on linux-kernel in early March.  Mail to
the most-recent email address I have for him, colin@nyx.net, is
bouncing.  I've tried whowhere and dejanews without any success.
Colin, if you read this, please get in touch.
