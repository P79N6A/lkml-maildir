Hi all,
 I've cleaned up the code that detects the size of
CPU cache in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c
It eliminates a variable, and moved the whole cache
detecting code out of the for loop, as I see no reason
for redetecting it with each iteration.
This is against 2.3.19, but should work against 2.2.x
too, with some offsets.
regards,
Dave.
