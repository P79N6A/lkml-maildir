Could any of you (I'm sure you could) tell me what books/web sites would be useful in teaching me how to code drivers and the like (anything to do with the kernel)?
I would someday like to be able to read thru the kernel source and actually be able to make changes to it rather than (as of right now) just gawk at the code ;-)
My dream someday is to contribute to the development of the Linux kernel
Thanks,
Jeffrey Stedfast
