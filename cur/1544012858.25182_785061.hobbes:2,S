Well, that's basically what I want - I want to use vunmap in an 
interrupts-disabled context.  Any other possibility of deferring tlb 
flushes is pure bonus and not all that important.
But it also occurred to me that Xen doesn't use IPIs for cross-cpu TLB 
flushes (it goes to hypercall), so it shouldn't be an issue anyway.  I 
haven't had a chance to look at what's really going on there.
