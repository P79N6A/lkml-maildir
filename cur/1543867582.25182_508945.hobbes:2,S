I think all kernel threads should call try_to_freeze() in suitable places
anyway if we are going to use the freezer for anything more than just the
suspend.  In other words, they all should be _able_ to freeze if necessary.

Yes, but I think it's just a generalization of ingoring PF_NOFREEZE.
If all kernel threads are able to freeze, we can mark them as "freeze for CPU
hotplug" or "freeze for kprobes", or "freeze for suspend" etc. and call the
freezer with the appropriate parameter.
BTW, what happens to a process running on a CPU being removed?

Hmmm.  In fact the problem is that the suspend code freezes tasks and then
calls disable_nonboot_cpus() which uses (_)cpu_down/up().  In principle we
could make disable_nonboot_cpus() call some lower-level routines to avoid the
freezing of tasks, _but_ the suspend code may freeze too few tasks (ie. we may
want to freeze more tasks for the CPU hotplug).  Thus I think we should do
something like this:
suspend:				CPU hotplug:
freeze_processes(SUSPEND)	...
...					freeze_processes(CPU_HOTPLUG)
...					...
...					thaw_processes(CPU_HOTPLUG)
thaw_processes(SUSPEND)	...
so freeze_processes() should be reentrant, at least for different values of
the argument.
All in all, I think we should start from modifying the freezer and the
classification of processes with respect to the freezing.

Rafael
