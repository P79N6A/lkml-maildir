Hmm, I'm not sure I understand the XFS side of your report here - on
open, for quota to be coming into play we must be creating a new inode
and those code paths inside XFS have no use of IS_ERR/ERR_PTR magic...
did you mean there's generic problems here (I can see those macros are
used in the generic VFS open() code) ... or am I missing your point?
thanks.
