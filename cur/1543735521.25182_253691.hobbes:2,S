Do you mean "return cookies for all existing processes"? Or "return
cookies for all processes created since X" (if so, what's X?) ?

Correct.

Makes perfect sense. You can pre-assemble an array of field IDs, hand
them over to the kernel, and get the requested fields in the requested
order.

With nproc as-is you can send a request that matches your desired struct
and cast the result to a pointer to your struct.
An application can build its own cookie simply by always requesting a set
of fields that _together_ can be used to identify a process. I reckon that
PID + process creation timestamp would be a good combination (except that
the latter is not currently available). The creation of the complete reply
to a request is atomic per process, the race is gone. What is not possible
right now is selecting processes based on a cookie -- the only selectors
so far are "all of them" and "select by PID".
