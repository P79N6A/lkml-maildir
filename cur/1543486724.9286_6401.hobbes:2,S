Now you should ifconfig device tunl1 exactly as you make it
with ethernet/ppp etc. tunl1 exists now (exactly as ethernet card
plugged in, but not ifconfig'ed), but it has no IP address attached to it.
F.e. select some address range to be routed via tunnel (f.e. 10.0.0.1/24)
and make something sort of:
ifconfig tunl1 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
Details depend on actual addresses, which you need to route via
tunnel.

BTW it is non-sense: 212.93.129.104 and 212.93.158.1 are supposed
to be routed via normal (not-tunneled) IP.
