   Can Linux 2.4 use the hardware checksumming in the e1000 adapter?
Two things:
1) On output you only get checksumming if your applications
   use sendfile()
2) On input, since we have to copy the data anyways, we use
   csum_partial_copy because it costs the same as a memcpy.
   Actually, on some x86 cpus the checksum+copy is faster
   than the memcpy, but that is being fixed in current 2.5.x
