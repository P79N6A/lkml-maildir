I take this back.  Redirecting stdin to the attribute file would increase 
the module's refcount and cause rmmod to exit immediately with an error.
After some more thought, I basically agree with what Oliver wrote
originally.  sysfs_dirent is indeed the logical place to store the kref
pointer.  However it needs to be used during open and release, not during
read, write, and poll.  Another point, which Oliver didn't think of, is
that the kref pointer needs to be passed to the driver as an argument in
the show() and store() method calls.
Implementing this will be difficult.  One possibility is to change the 
definition of sysfs_ops, adding the new struct kref * argument to the 
prototypes.  This will involve changing _lots_ of source files, adding an 
unused argument to many functions, which isn't attractive.
The other possibility is to test at runtime whether the kref pointer is 
NULL, and if it is, don't pass it.  This would work, but it isn't 
type-safe.
Finally, there's added complexity in each driver which wants to use the 
new facility.  The module_exit routine will need to be smart enough to 
block until all the private data structures have been released.  
usb-storage does something like that now; it's kind of ugly (although it 
could be improved if appropriate support were added to the core kernel).
