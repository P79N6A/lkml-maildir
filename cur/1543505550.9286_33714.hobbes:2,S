Subject: weird socket refusal by kernel 2.2.11

I just upgraded both my systems to kernel 2.2.11 - one a 486 DX2-80 and a
P166
Very strange thing happened, the 486 wouldnt accept any connections to it
I logged in to it from the console, no firewall problems were logged,
nothing logged in /var/log/secure, infact it said there that the
connection was accepted and not refused.
As soon as I telnetted to these ports locally, it worked again from my
other machine, could get access fine.
anyone else had this problem?
It seemed likd it established the connection then dropped it.
the only other thing that ran on this box between now and when i last
logged into it was a tape backup using the ftape drivers to drive a
Colorado QIC-80 2120 tape drive.
any ideas?
