OK, well that was interesting.  Your patch cleared up my problem with sg.  
Now I have a new ide-scsi failure mode.  I'm pounding on this one because 
whatever magic was supposed to happen with ide-cd didn't.  I've documented 
it in a separate message.
I can now insert and remove ide-scsi modules (sr_mod, sg, scsi_mod, cdrom, 
ide-scsi).  However, when I then insert the ide-scsi modules a second 
time, it sees my disks at a different device!  I have a CDROM at ide1 
primary, and a CDRW at ide1 secondary.  ide-scsi normally sees them as 
/dev/scd0 and /dev/scd1, respectively.  After the modules are reinserted I 
get them reversed.  ide1 primary is now seen at /dev/scd1 and ide1 
secondary is seen at /dev/scd0.  Furthermore, this happens each time I 
repeat the cycle.  On the next cycle they are back to ide1 primary at 
/dev/scd0.  In other words, they alternate, depending on how many 
remove/insert cycles I go through.
If I simply insert the modules and leave them, thing act normally.  
However, once I remove them I get a segfault and system hang at reboot.
