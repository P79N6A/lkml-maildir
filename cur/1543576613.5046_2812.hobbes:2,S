Good point.  Up until recently the page dirty bit wasn't actually being
set anywhere and page->buffers was acting as kind of a surrogate dirty
bit - page_launder would call try_to_free_buffers which would find the
dirty buffers and fail out, but start io first
It looks like PG_dirty is now being used only for swap_cache pages, and
not for buffer cache and page cache pages, is that correct?
