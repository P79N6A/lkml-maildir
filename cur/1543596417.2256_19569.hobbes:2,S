I have had absolutely WONDERFUL luck with the Gigabyte GA-7DX and GA-7DXR boards.  My setup is slightly high-end, but here's what I have:
(GA-7DX):
AMD Athlon TBird 1.33Ghz
256MB DDR SDRAM
Yamaha YMF744 Soundcard
CardXpert NVidia Geforce 2 MX (32MB)
some random bt848 videocapture card from Intel
Tekram DC390U3D Ultra3 SCSI
Matrox Networks Tulip (PNIC II Actually) NIC.
Works like a charm.  Here's the other machine:
(GA-7DXR):
TBird 1.33Ghz
No sound
Maxtrox Millenium G200 (I think... only used it in text mode)
1.25GB ECC DDR SDRAM
AMI Megaraid Elite 1600 Dual Ultra3 SCSI Raid.
The first machine is using a SuperMicro power supply (350 watts *sustained* 370 peak I think)
The second is using a random company dual 400W hotswap redundant PS.
All an all, I've had amazing luck with this hardware.  If you're looking at it, give these a try.  YMMV.
