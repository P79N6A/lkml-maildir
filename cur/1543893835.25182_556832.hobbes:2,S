I was wondering if anyone has done any sort of virtualization testing
with kvm using IOMMU to improve performance of I/O and what sort of
results they've had... I currently don't have a box with IOMMU (at
least I don't think so, since its an i386 box) but will be getting
some amd64 boxes which, hopefully will have that capability.
I was also wondering if kvm can take advantage of IOMMU does it need
to be run a different way? or is it supposed to 'just work' if the
kernel is built with IOMMU?
I keep seeing IOMMU patches fly by on the lkml however those are from
the intel guys and the new boxes we are getting are amd... have the
amd IOMMU support gotten into the kernel yet?
Not sure if this is the best place to ask these questions, so any help
to point me in the right direction on who to talk to would also be
helpful.
Thanks,
