That part I missed.

Yes I tested it. It worked in my test code, unfortunately the enable_irq
part of it didn't show up because the other patches in that test set
included ones for dynamically detecting interrupt routing errors and
they hid it.
Alan
ps: Pavel - the X folks played with several ideas for handling
interrupts
from user space that could be shared, forwarded to user space and
handled and it always came back to either a small kernel module or an
interpretable set of
descriptions of how to test for and mask the IRQ, and in some cases to
save
several values. Something like
struct descriptor {
	u8  type:2; /* 0 PCI cfg, 1 mem, 2 I/O */
	u8  width:2;
	u32 offset;
	u32 mask;
	u32 value;
}
struct irq_descriptor {
	char name[16];			/* For request irq */
	struct descriptor test;
	struct descriptor mask;
	struct descriptor save[4];
};
although nobody ever implemented it. This would also have been outside
of just vm86 as the main user would be X.
