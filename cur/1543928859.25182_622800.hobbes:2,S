We used to have only the serial driver resource reservation.  We now
have an additional 00:06 resource that is the parent of the serial
resource, e.g.,
  03f8-03ff : 00:06
    03f8-03ff : serial
I think this problem happens because pnp_bus_suspend() calls
serial_pnp_suspend(), which suspends the driver but does nothing
with the resources.  Then it calls pnp_stop_dev(), which releases
the 00:06 resource, which still has a serial child resource.
The corresponding PCI code in pci_device_suspend() does not do
any generic device disable or resource release.  I don't know
why PNP disables the device on suspend.  I glanced through the
ACPI spec but didn't see a requirement for it.  Maybe Pierre [1]
remembers.
Maybe we could either remove the pnp_{stop,start}_dev() calls
from the suspend/resume path, or move the PNP resource management
out of pnp_{start,stop}_dev().
