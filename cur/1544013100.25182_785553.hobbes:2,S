	Definitely don't like the pdflush method.  You guys are right
that it is buggy.

	I like the patch overall.  A couple comments.

	Regarding merge, I'd rather drop the export patch and merge this
with the patch that uses pdflush_operation().

	Ok, I found what I was looking for.  The workqueue is not
flushed when unmounting a single volume, and I wanted to be sure that
was correct.  It is, as vfs_quota_disable() calls ->write_info() before
calling ->free_file_info() here.  So we can just cancel any delayed work
and forget about it safely.

	Don't you need to shutdown the quota workqueue if
register_quota_format() fails?
