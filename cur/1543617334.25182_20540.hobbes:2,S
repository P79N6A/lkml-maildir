	linux-2.5.2/drivers/net/sungem.c uses devexit_p, which is not
currently in 2.5.2.  I understand the purpose of devexit_p and I have
kludged around it for myself.  I am just bringing it to your attention
so you can figure out whether to remove the devexit_p reference, have
a workaround for kernels that lack it, or add devexit_p to Linus's tree.
