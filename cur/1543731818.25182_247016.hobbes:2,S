Unless he explains a bit better, there's no reason
to assume he counted correctly. There may be a larger
pattern that was counted by mistake. For example,
there may be 160x120 red-sensing sub-pixels. He could
have counted only that.
Also, there is more than one type of sensor that can
be fitted to these webcam chips. They may vary.
