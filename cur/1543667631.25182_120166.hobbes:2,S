	I've encountered two reproducable bugs, and one feature which can and can not 
be called bug:
1. Radeon frame buffer driver doesn't support mode change in kernel boot 
params. In 2.6.65 it is OK.
	append line from lilo.conf
    append = " hdd=ide-scsi video=radeon:1024x768-24@100"
	No mether what is in video=radeon:..., resolution is always set to 80x30 with 
60Hz refresh.
2. Radeon frame buffer mode switching gives unexpected results. When switching 
from lower res to higher, switching is ok but you still have old chararcter 
res. eg. 80x30. The text is located in upper left corner, and the right side 
off the text area is filled with garbage. Bellow text area there is nothing.
3. Cursor disapears when moving with cursor keys. This is very annoying when 
you are editing text for example.
	My config is attached, gcc version is 2.95.3, modutils 2.4.21.
