The wording could also apply to a DMA of 8k from a 4k-aligned address.
But I don't have a good idea how to improve it.

s/always copy/always behave as if copying/
memcpy usually copies at least wordwise, possibly even in bigger chunks.
But that is just the inner loop.  Unaligned bytes at the beginning/end
receive special treatment.
