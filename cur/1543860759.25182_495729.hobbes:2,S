Erm ... for a device driver, if we're preparing to do I/O on the page
something must have made the user caches coherent ... that can't be
kmap, because the driver might elect to DMA on the page ... unless
another component of this API is going to be to make dma_map_... also
flush the user cache?

well ... currently the pages come down to fuse via get_user_pages()
which does have a flush_dcache_page() as part of its operation.

Agreed.

Agreed.

You mean to map congruently for the page using something like our
temporary cache alias scheme?  Yes ... it should be possible for the
short lived kmap_atomic() type maps ... it will be a bit harder for the
non-atomic longer lived maps ... but I think we're deprecating those.
