Yes. But as I wrote in the mail to Christoph, we currently don't have a 
chance to use some in-kernel structure (pci device, i2c bus) that 
automatically exports the firmware loading magic through sysfs.
Because of this, we would have to write our own sysfs backend for the 
dvb i2c subsystem, in order to get proper firmware loading support.
As I already mentioned in another mail, we want to go back to the kernel 
i2c subsystem.
Currently, the stuff is running quite stable and is "in use".
Changing the i2c subsystem would require changes in all frontend drivers 
+ plus in the dvb drivers exporting the i2c facilities.
Is such a big change acceptable for 2.6 if it fixes these horrible hacks 
or is this 2.7 stuff?
CU
Michael.
