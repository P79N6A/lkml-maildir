Subject: New compiler's kernels won't boot

Encountered internal compiler errors with pgcc from Mandrake
distribution when building 2.3.37-39 kernels.  Heeding advice
from this list, I uninstalled the mandrake pgcc and installed
egcs-1.1.2-24  from the four redhat rpms.
    Now the kernel compile completes without internal errors
( a few %eax warnings) but the bzImage stops loading:
Uncompressing kernel....booting the kernel
that's where it stops.  Even kernels previously built with
pgcc that booted fine  now hang when rebuilt with egcs-1.1.2-24.
What have I overlooked?
Much modified Mandrake-6.0 distribution.
