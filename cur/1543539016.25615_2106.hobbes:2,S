It rings a bell.  [ grep, grep ]
Sheldon Easterbrook <sheldie@hotmail.com>. Same backtrace.  test1-ac21.
Joseph Fannin <fannin.30@osu.edu>, test1-ac18.  Also same backtrace.
Chris the Elder <chippo@netactive.co.za> caught it in 2.3.99-pre8,
different backtrace.
Soeren, what compiler are you using?

     I'm getting an Oops in recent devel kernels.  To say it up front,
this Oops only occurs when kernels since test1-ac18 are compiled with
2.95.2; the recommended compilers are fine.  If the bug is with the
compiler, I hope to get some info that could be useful to the egcs team.
     Executing the program 'pidof' with any arguments (or none) causes
an Oops and a segmentation fault.  I have seen this behavior on two
different machines running two different distribs (RedHat 6.2 and
Mandrake 7.1) with two different compilers (gcc / pgcc 2.95.3).  Both
these distribs use 'pidof' in their init scripts, spewing many Oopsen
with each boot.  I build most of the alpha kernels, and have saw
it                                                 first with t1-ac18.
     Both distribs use the latest 2.78 version of SysVinit (which
contains the 'pidof' program.)
