Really? Coolness..  so the onus is on the userspace process to specify
which partitions are suspected of having changed?  Is that the reason for
a new ioctl?
Just out of curiousity: What was the motivation for adding a new ioctl?
What would have been wrong with also hacking BLKRRPART to behave this way,
as in, have it figure out if a re-read is possible based on the heuristics
I already suggested...
