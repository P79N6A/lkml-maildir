It still means that name space invariancy cannot be guaranteed.

Not entirely, there is a UID dependancy.

This is not what I mean. The directory contents itself must be identical
for every user. And every name must of course correspond with only one
dentry. That's name-space invariance IMO.

Exactly. And such a difference in permission already exists for (sane)
networked file systems such as NFS with "squash_root" in effect on
the server.
