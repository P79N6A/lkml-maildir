Actually, if the NSA wanted to slip in a back door, they'd have done so
in the SELinux code. :)
As others have mentioned, the kernel code isn't the best place to try
to put a back door in, precisely because of the depth of scrutiny.  A
much more likely avenue is to backdoor some popular userspace code (as
did happen to Sendmail and OpenSSH within a few weeks of each other a
few years ago).
And then there's the Underhanded C Code contest:
