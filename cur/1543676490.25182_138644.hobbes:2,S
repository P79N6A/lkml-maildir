Actually, I believe they are an extension, which GCC honors.  Unnamed
structures in standard C99 are actually declaring an unnamed type, not
an unnamed member.  Try it:
     struct {
       int a;
       union {
         int b;
         float c;
       };
       int d;
     } foo;
int bar()
{
  return foo.a + foo.d + foo.b;
}
With -std=c99, the reference to foo.b is an error; with -std=gnu99 or
-std=gnu89, it is accepted.
I don't know why they were getting rejected for Paul, though.  Did you
have GNU set to -ansi mode?
