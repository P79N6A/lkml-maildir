Yes, but those reasons are very likely no longer true.
In fact, just removing the memcpy macro altogether is the best
thing to do.  GCC will do inline memcpy when appropriate.
Then put all of the rep; movsl; etc. code in an external
assembler file and name the routine memcpy.
The inlining is senseless even if it all gets optimized away
into the bare necessary instructions.  All the x86 registers
get clobbered in most of those rep; movsl; code paths, so
it's hardly going to be more expensive to extern the thing
and it will make the kernel smaller to boot.
Anyways the point is to make the real C symbol called by "memcpy"
because that's what makes all the automatic gcc inline memcpy logic
kick in.  If you define the "memcpy" as a macro which calls
differently named functions, you bypass all of that.
