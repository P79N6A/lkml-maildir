I had errors like that one when the IDE IRQ was at a priority less than
the real time task. Since then, I run with all the IRQ's at max RT priority
and will continue to do so until I get a better assessment of what my real
application (not these audio tests...) needs for IRQ priorities.
This may have been fixed as a side effect of Ingo setting the IRQ threads
at
RT priorities in the 40's.
