I have the following little message in my log with rc4-mm1 that I don't 
have with vanilla rc4, running on a single processor athlon 64 box:
ACPI Error (acpi_processor-0488): Getting cpuindex for acpiid 0x1 [20060210]
It apparently gets printed here (in drivers/acpi/processor_core.c):
        /*
         *  Extra Processor objects may be enumerated on MP systems with
         *  less than the max # of CPUs. They should be ignored _iff
         *  they are physically not present.
         */
        if (cpu_index >= NR_CPUS) {
                if (ACPI_FAILURE
                    (acpi_processor_hotadd_init(pr->handle, &pr->id))) {
                        ACPI_ERROR((AE_INFO,
                                    "Getting cpuindex for acpiid 0x%x",
                                    pr->acpi_id));
                        return_VALUE(-ENODEV);
                }
        }
It doesn't seem to cause anything not to work, but I thought I'd mention 
it anyway.  If it is obvious to anyone why I get the message, I won't 
have to try to bisect the patches.
I can send my config if anyone wants to see it, and I can also test 
patches.  I'm not subscribed to the list, so please CC me.
Thanks,
Kevin Winchester
