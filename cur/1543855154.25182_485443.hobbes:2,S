That index is provided by kernel for userspace so that userspace could
determine where indexes are - of course userspace can maintain it
itself, but it can also use provided by kernel. It is not written
explicitly, but only through kevent_commit().

No, head will not be writeable - it is absolutely.
I do not care actually about that index, but as you have probably noticed, 
there was such an interface already, and I changed it. So, this will be the 
last change of the interface. You think it should not be exported -
fine, it will not be.
