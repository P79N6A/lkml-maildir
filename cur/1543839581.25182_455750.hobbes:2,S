I'm not sure that I ever got an underrun (may check it
for you if you need that, how to do it?),
but mplayer -ao alsa is working for me just fine.
I eliminated skips due to CPU and disk using
nice and -cache 8000. I still can make it skip
when my KDE background picture is changing.
I think that these skips are caused by the X server.
It has no prioritization for request handling and
thus it does not paint mplayer output fast enough:
it needs to repaint background and semi-transparent
konsole(s), and that is taking a few seconds at least.
This is probably aggravated by serializing nature of Xlib,
according to:
