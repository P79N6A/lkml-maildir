You do not have the data required to (a) detect the problem and (b)
recover even if you could detect the problem.  The APIC bus has a
single bit checksum, the APIC hardware detects single bit errors and
does a retransmission.  It _cannot_ detect double bit errors, the bad
data is accepted and processed with undefined side effects.
What you see in the logs for a BP6 are error messages for single bit
errors that were recovered by the hardware.  You will never see
messages for double bit errors, just unexplained oops and/or machine
hangs.
Yes, I have a BP6 :(.
