That one looks totally wrong to me. Without even testing it, it will
have side effects that you haven't run into yet. Unless the TTY core
changed so much, this comments are there for a really good reason and
the code is tested a lot.
Also if you have to do two rfcomm_dev_put() in a row, then we are doing
something really wrong and this tries to hide a real bug somewhere.
Regards
Marcel
