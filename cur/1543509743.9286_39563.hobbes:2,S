We are trying to restore a filesystem which backup (made this amanda
on a RedHat 6.0 distribution) is larger than 2Go on the tape.
Since we cannot restore the dump file because of the file size limit
of 2Go, we have tried to use the following L
amrestore -p /dev/nst0 yamacraw /export/home1 | restore -i -v
- -b 2 -f -
It appears that somehow the pipe crash (see below).
Verify tape and initialize maps
amrestore: WARNING: not at start of tape, file numbers will be offset
amrestore: 0: restoring yamacraw.ece.gatech.edu._export_home1.19990909.0
Dump date: Thu Sep 9 07:10:13 1999
Dumped from: the epoch
Level 0 dump of /export/home1 on yamacraw.ece.gatech.edu:/dev/sdb3
Label: none
Error 32 (Broken pipe) offset 0+32768, wrote -1073742664
(^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^)
amrestore: pipe reader has quit in middle of file.
amrestore: skipping ahead to start of next file, please wait...
Segmentation fault
What is interesting is we have this problem only with /export/home1. All the
others backup works fine regarding the restoration with the same method.
The size of their dumps seems to be less than 2Go.
Can someone give me some hints ??
Regards, Didier.
