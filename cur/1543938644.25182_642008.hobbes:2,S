Uhm... the conversion is exact as long as you have at least centikelvin 
precision (0 °C = 273.15 K by definition, and the multiplier is 1.)

This was more a comment as to it possibly being a convenient format for 
more than this particular sensor.
The nice thing with kelvins is no need to worry about negative numbers 
and something misparsing them, that's all.
I certainly did not imply that we should even consider use °F.  That's 
obviously ridiculous.
