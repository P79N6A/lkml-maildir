Amdahl's Law?
Thats a reference I don't believe I've been made aware of.  Can you
elaborate?
Besides, it isn't my proposal, just a question in that I chose a
scenario (ghostscripts rendering of a page of text) that in fact only
runs maybe 10x faster on an XP-2800 Athlon with a gig of dram than it
did on my old 25 mhz 68040 equipt amiga with 64 megs of dram.  
With 64 megs of dram, so it wasn't nearly as memory bound doing that
as most of the Amiga's were.
