In theory, yes -- you could do what linux does in the kernel to
recover then someone executes this code.
I'm not sure if you could do this from userland, perhaps you can by
looping though f00f intructions and seeing how many faults the
processes introduces... you should see at least one peer f00f hit...
Hmm... actually, I might see if I can code that up shortly.
