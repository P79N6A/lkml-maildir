640x480 is normal.

Because fbset is only useful for setting /dev/fb. You want to use stty
to set the resolution now. The advantage of this is we don't end up
with a console mode of 80 3/4 columns by 30 1/4 rows. 
Try
stty cols 160 rows 64 
assuming you are using 8x16 fonts.

Sounds like a monitor timings issue. fbset cheats by taking
times from the /etc/fb.mods file. I'm working on patch 
that was sent to me to deal with this.

Same problem again. It is a monitor timings issue. 
We are working on this.
