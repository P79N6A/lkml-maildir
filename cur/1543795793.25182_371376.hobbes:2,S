A really nice feature of AdvFS is fileset-level snapshots.  For my Alpha
servers, I don't have to allocate disk space to snapshot storage; the
fileset uses free space within the fileset for changes while a snapshot
is active.  For my Linux servers using LVM, I have to leave a chunk of
space free in the volume group, make sure it is big enough, make sure
only one snapshot exists at a time (or make sure there's enough free
space for multiple snapshots), etc.
AdvFS is also fully integrated with TruCluster; when I started
clustering, I didn't have to change anything for most of my storage.
I will miss AdvFS when we turn off our Alphas for the last time (which
won't be far off I guess; final order date for an HP Alpha system is
less than a year away now).

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
