Nothing goes wrong. What happens without the IRQ_LEVEL bit is this:
	CPU0					CPU1
	------------------			--------------------
	do_IRQ(27, ...)
						do_IRQ(27, ...)
	spin_lock();
						spin_lock() spinning
	->ack that is a disable_irq(27)
	set pending bit
	irq not disabled and not in progress
	so set irq_inprogress bit and clear
	pending bit
	spin_unlock();
						got the lock finally
						set pending bit
						^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
						irq is in progress so goto out
						->end now correctly does
						nothing because irq is
						inprogress
						spin_unlock();
	handle_IRQ_event();
	spin_lock();
	pending bit is set, so clear it and
	iff the new IRQ_LEVEL bit is _not_ set,
	then re-run handle_IRQ_event()
	...
The IRQ_LEVEL bit prevents that second run to happen if it wasn't
necessary.
And no, we can't delegate the cpu selection to the hardware. That's why
smp irq affinity is much more important for alpha where there aren't only
i/d cache issues (and RT issues when we'll have task cpu binding), but it
also risks to get contention on the irq_desc lock.
