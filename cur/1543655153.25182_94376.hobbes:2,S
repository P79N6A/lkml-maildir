 reports that Debian's freeswan package
(
http://packages.debian.org/testing/non-us/freeswan.html
) causes a
kernel kernel panic due to improper handling of short packets.  A
userspace program shouldn't be able to cause a kernel panic (unless it
tries, and is priveliged), so I believe this indicates a kernel problem.
