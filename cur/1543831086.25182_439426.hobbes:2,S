Andi,
As a first step, I am looking at implementing a TIF_DEBUG
for x86-64. AFAIK, debug registers must not be inherited on
fork().
In copy_thread(), I do not see the place where the child's
debug registers (or just debugreg7) are cleared to avoid
reloading the parents values in __switch_to() if debugreg7
is not 0. I believe the debug registers values are copied
in dup_task_struct().
Am I missing something?
