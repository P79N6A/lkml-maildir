Subject: The linux-kernel list has disappeared for me.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have been unsuccessful contacting the List Admin with this request.
Please accept my apology for posting this to the list. Please, somebody, make the mail list admin aware of this request.  Given the possiblilty of a two way filter to kernel.org I am posting this via Netscape mail.  
List Admin,
Help.
I have subscribed to the linux-kernel mailing list for years with my SBC-ameritech account.  This turns out to run through prodigy.net. Anyway this is my problem.   I no longer receive the kernel mailing list.
The e-mail address it is sent to is aquamodem@ameritech.net
I have contacted the SBC administrator and they tell me that unless I can prove that they are blocking the linux-kernel list, they are not at fault.  The only proof that they will accept is a bounce message from:  prodigy.net
with a possible source of abuse@prodigy.net.  They want to see that bounce message returned to abuse@prodigy.net with the title and first line of Request Removal from Relay.   If they don't see this bounce message then they won't do anything and I am no longer a participant in the list.
I obviously don't want this mail list terminated.
Please look for this bounce and help me, also, cc me on whatever you do.  If possible, also, cc receipt of this message from another domain in-case kernel.org is blocked.
Thanks
walter lundby
