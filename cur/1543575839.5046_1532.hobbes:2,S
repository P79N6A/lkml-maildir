okay. got it here this morning, too. solid lock -- no dumping out of 
x, no changing terminals, no mouse, no keyboard.
k6-2-550 @ 500; 256mb memory, fic 503a mb with via chipset. kernel 
built with gcc-2.95-2 against glibc-2.2. nothing remarkable underway 
-- was composing a message in kmail, which i've done successfully 
multiple times since upgrading to test12.
