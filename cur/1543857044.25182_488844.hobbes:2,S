If they do not allow controlling the state of the radio
programmatically then it should not be part of rfkill I am afraid. It
is like the power switch - if you hold it for so long it kills the
power to the box and there is nothing you can do about it.

That is my point. Given the fact that there are keys that are not
directly connected with the radio switch userspace will have to handle
them (wait for events then turn off radios somehow). You are
advocating that userspace should also implement 2nd method for buttons
that belong to rfkill interface. I do not understand the need for 2nd
interface. If you separate radio switch from button code then
userspace only need to implement 1st interface and be done with it.
You will have set of cards that provide interface to enable/disable
their transmitters and set of buttons that signal userspace desired
state change. If both switch and button is implemented by the same
driver then the driver can implement automatic button handling.
Otherwise userspace help is necessary.

Fans of the 3rd method, speak up ;)

Unless the key is not directly connected to the driver (so there is no
sysfs entry). Again you force 2 different interfaces.
