i concur.
"cut-through" is generally marketing these days.
there are some switches in the marketplace today which do cut-through 
switching, but fall back to store-&-forward when:
  - there is congestion in a port (i.e. output port is busy; queue frame)
  - the sender & receiver are of mismatched speeds
  - the receiver initiates gig-e flowcontrol
note that "cut-through switching" means that you lose the ability of the 
switch to drop corrupted frames.  i.e. how can it check the ethernet crc32 
and validate it until its all been sent?  in short, it cannot.
in real-world traffic scenarios, there is very little real-world scenarios 
where cut-through actually occurs.
