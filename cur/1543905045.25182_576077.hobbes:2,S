I never intended for this core_pattern argument passing to be able to expand
macros, other than the macros specified by the core_pattern code.  If you want
it to do that, we can address that with a later patch.

I disagree. While it might be nice to be able to specify environment variables
as command line arguments, it would be much easier to just let the core_pattern
executable inherit the crashing processes environment.  we don't do that
currently, but we easily could.  That way any information that the crashing
process wants the dying process to know can be inherited and vetted easily by
apport (or whatever the core_pattern points to).  I'll do a patch later for that
if you don't like it.

If you don't want to use a given macro, fine, don't use it.  If you want to use
a macro, thats fine too, but I really don't want to offer the ability to pass
macro's in core_pattern (it really just makes the parsing too hairy and prone to
error).  If you want to pass macros to apport, or whatever, we'll just let the
user mode helper inherit the crashing processes environment.  Its much easier
work, just as usefull, and more importantly, can be done later as a separate
piece of work.
