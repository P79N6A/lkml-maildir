I am seeing crashes in FC4 rawhide with the 2.6.xx kernel in FC4 rawhide
as well. However, I only see  it if I start, and then try to save the
document (without or without changes).. i.e. saving a new document... I
may see this under saving as as well, but I rarely do that so I don't
know. (AMD Athlon here, not Athlon64)
That is the ONLY crash I see.

"The idea that Bill Gates has appeared like a knight in shining armour
to lead all customers out of a mire of technological chaos neatly
ignores the fact that it was he who, by peddling second-rate technology,
led them into it in the first place." -- Douglas Adams, on Windows '95.
