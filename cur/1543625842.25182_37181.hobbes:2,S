I grepped a year's lkml traffic - nobody is hitting any
of them...
The quotaops.h checks were useless:
	if (pointer == NULL)
		BUG();
	dereference(pointer);
The others can become calls to out_of_line_bug() if
you want.  That's dget(), unhash_process(),
memclear_highpage_flush(), __skb_pull() and tcp_prequeue()
