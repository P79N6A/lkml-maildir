I know.
But it PCI id/vendor probably will not match.
But if you think, it's better to add all 12-15 models separately,
why not?
I can start asking for this information...
FX240 will have:
MATCH(DMI_PRODUCT_NAME, "PCG-FX240(UC)")
probably 
MATCH(DMI_PRODUCT_NAME, "PCG-FX240")
is enough.
Do you know any simple tool to retrieve DMI information?
