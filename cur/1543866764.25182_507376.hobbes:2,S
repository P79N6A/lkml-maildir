That is correct - and apparently for all ABIs because I wasn't able to find
a compat_sys_epoll_pwait at all.
Unfortunately struct epoll_event contains a gap so it bets on identical
padding rules between native and compat ABI and anyway, padding is wasted
space so the struct members should have been swapped when this structure
was created.  Oh well, too late.
