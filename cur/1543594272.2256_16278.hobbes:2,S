These days I observed massive FS curruption on vanilla 2.4.5,
SCSI disk on Sym53c8-something controller (UW).  I did not notice
any problems since 2.4.5 was published, they seem to have surfaced
immediately after I created a rather big file capturing video with
broadcast2000 (video card is bt848).  Filesystem is ext2.
