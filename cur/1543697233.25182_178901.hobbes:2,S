But once you've done it, incoming changesets are then added incrementally, 
right? You don't just convert the tree once a day?
So you'd just need to maintain two copies of the cvs tree, one which currently 
available for coherent transmission to lobobk clients, and the other which 
can be updated, with a means of swapping them

But, as I described in my previous post, it also has at least one useful 
commercial application.

The 2.5 tree is <300Mb, so just stick 4Gb in your machine, the bk and cvs tree 
in tmpfs and, well, throw the HD away ;)

This was in anticipation of somebody calling me a whinging pom. And sure 
enough... (And yes, my antipodean mates, we are going to _stuff_ you on 
saturday!)

I think everyone who works for a living knows that already :)
