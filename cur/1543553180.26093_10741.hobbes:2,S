No apology was extended.  You're spouting nonsense.  User to user means
process A in VM 1 switching to process B in VM 2.  I'm sorry, Mr Merkey,
but a 
	mov    x, esp
	mov    esp, y
doesn't begin to approach a user to user context switch.  Please go learn
what a user to user context switch is.  Then come back when you can do
one of those in a few cycles.
