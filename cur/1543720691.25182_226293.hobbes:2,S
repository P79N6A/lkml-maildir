The following code casts pointers to char to long in order to do a fast
comparison. This causes alignment errors on IA64 and likely also on
other platforms:
        /* Look for ifname matches; this should unroll nicely. */
        for (i = 0, ret = 0; i < IFNAMSIZ/sizeof(unsigned long); i++) {
                ret |= (((const unsigned long *)indev)[i]
                        ^ ((const unsigned long *)arpinfo->iniface)[i])
                        & ((const unsigned long *)arpinfo->iniface_mask)[i];
        }
iniface is a pointer to char.
