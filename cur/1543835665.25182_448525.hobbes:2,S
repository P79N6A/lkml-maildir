Subject: Re: [PATCH] initramfs:  Allow rootfs to use tmpfs instead of ramfs

I am totally out of the loop here.  (BusyBox has been taking up all my time 
for months now...)
I thought rootfs already would be tmpfs whenever that was compiled into the 
kernel, but I suspect the kernel I was looking at to come to that conclusion 
wasn't vanilla.  Still, that implies this isn't the first patch out there to 
do this...

Yup.  Embedded people who generally have no swap anyway.  (Swap to flash is a 
bad idea.)  However, I believe what they were after was the ability to limit 
the filesystem size so runaway logs don't trigger the OOM killer.

I remember this was "pending" late last year.  Thought it had made it into 
2.6.16 or so.  I need _way_ more time to read the kernel list.  (I'm 50,197 
messages behind.  That's just silly...)

It doesn't look like -stable material to me either.  It might be small enough 
to add to the current -devel cycle, but that's not my call.
Is there any current documentation on the kernel's init sequence other than 
reading init/main.c and friends?

Never bet against the cheap plastic solution.
