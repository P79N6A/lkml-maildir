On all Moto PPCs I've checked, the time-base runs at 1/4 the bus clock
rather than at the core clock like we're used to on x86.
I believe many PPCs allow you to program one of the performance counters
to count core clocks. Be advised though that many Moto PPCs in the 750-7410
range have an errata that prevents using performance counter interrupts,
so you'd have to run the counter in non-interrupting mode.
This isn't available to user-space (yet), so you'd also have to hack
the kernel to use this facility.
