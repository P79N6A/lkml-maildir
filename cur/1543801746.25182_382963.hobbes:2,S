The problem we have is a bit different (or I didn't understand
something). The mac trackpad has it's own kernel driver and is all
relative mode. Luca's patch will make it work in absolute mode instead
for use with X synaptic driver, thus providing more "features" than the
default relative-mode one.
So what we are looking for is a way to have the kernel driver switch
between raw and ps2 modes based on instruction/ioctl from the userland
client (the X synaptic driver). This shouldn't be much of a problem if
the X synaptic driver switches it to raw at X start and on EnterVT and
back to what it was on LeaveVT...
Ben.
