not sure if that was the only reason. 2.6.3 and everything up breaks the
rtl nic in my laptop and i cant configure anything like edge-trigger in
my bios.
The nic works without problems when i use 2.6.2 version of 8139too.c. Is
there any possibility to get these or similar patches into 2.6.5 to
support a config option to get the old behavior?
