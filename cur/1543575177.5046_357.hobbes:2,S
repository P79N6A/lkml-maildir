I'm sorry but I still have some doubts:
The add_request function calls 
	spin_lock_irqsave(&io_request_lock,flags); 
and then calls our request_fn which does 
	spin_unlock_irq(&io_request_lock);
	...do network I/O ...
	spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock);
we finish the request and return to the add_request function which calls
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&io_request_lock,flags);
and restores the flags.     
Isn't it possible now that the flags which we restore are out of date now?
Is this idiom the right one to use for 2.2?
Thanks,
