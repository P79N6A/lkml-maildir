I figured that the printk_ratelimit() was probably placed there to
eliminate excessive noise due to the following scenario:
    - Process X calls out_of_memory() and shoots process Y.
    - Until Y gets a chance to execute and expire, lots of
      other processes will probably be failing their memory
      allocations and calling out_of_memory(), spewing more
      printk() messages.
I figured that since serializing the OOM kills would eliminate
this behavior, the printk_ratelimit() was no longer necessary.
However, there would still be lots of messages if the OOM killer
is repeatedly triggered due to lots of little processes eating
up memory.  In this case the printk_ratelimit() would serve a
purpose.  In any event there's no harm in leaving it in.  I'll
add back the printk_ratelimit() and make a new patch...

How about the following?
/* If an OOM kill is not already in progress, try once more to
 * allocate memory.  If allocation fails this time, invoke the
 * OOM killer.
 */
