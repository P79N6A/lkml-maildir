I think we should just get rid of the misconception that ext2_bread()
is a block read function.  It is only used by directory functions.
Instead we should have separate ext2_bread_leaf(), ext2_bread_root(),
ext2_bread_node() which do the appropriate validation for each type
of block.
In ext2_bread_dir() if we really think directory block prealloc is a win
(in addition to the existing in-memory contiguous block prealloc), we
may as well do it each time we split a leaf block, and make them valid
in-use leaf blocks instead of just wasting space on disk (i.e. each split
block has the hash space split into 1/N of the existing space, and we
distribute existing entries across all N blocks).
This way we don't have to split the each directory block so many times.
For indexed directories this is (probably) a net win because we avoid
N extra block splits (i.e. extra copying of leaf blocks), and make the
leaf search space smaller.  On non-indexed ext2 it would be a net loss
because we would still have to read and search each directory block,
even if they are empty.

I don't think that is what I was seeing, because the hash block numbers
were not "->1" and "->2" (which would be the case right after a split),
but rather 30's, 40's, etc.

One other point of information.  In the test I was running, it was
always the file "509.r" which had the I/O error (new filesystem each
test run, btw, and no IDE errors in the log).
