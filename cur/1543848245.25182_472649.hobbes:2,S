No, you're asking for the effective set to also not be cleared, but the
manpage only says the permitted set is maintained.

Are you able to modify the source of the application you bought?  If so,
you can trivially fix it to do what you need by doing a cap_set_proc
after the suid as I described before, i.e.
	ret = setuid();
	caps = cap_from_text("cap_net_raw=e");
	ret = cap_set_proc(caps);
Is that an option?
