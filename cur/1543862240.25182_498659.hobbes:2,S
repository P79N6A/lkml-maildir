you point to the right spot... This has a historic reason as we
have needed to support fork(), system("date") etc for kernel 2.6.9, 
hence those vma flags manipulation and this pid checking as proactive
protection/restriction. For newer kernel, I guess >=2.6.12, this checking
were not necessary, but we would feel better after we had tested user 
space stuff more thoroughly without this piece of code. Since this is 
not new code, can we pls handle this later?
