Hello,
I just saw that we've been having those messages on at least 4 DELL 2650 ( running tg3 driver version 1.4c)
running busy FTP servers ( all in the same load balanced FTP farm )
ftp1 # egrep -c "hw tcp v4 csum failed" /var/log/kern.log
1846
for the last 3 days.
The box is running 2.4.21-pre5.
Is this a known problem ? ( i've seen that driver 1.5 is available BTW)
or more likely a network issue ?
Thanks,
Philippe
