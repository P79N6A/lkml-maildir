Aliens ate my brain, part 1:
I tried building an out-of-tree ipfilters (ipt_osf) that worked fine under
2.6.20-rc4-mm1.  After much scratching my head and adding debugging info,
I discovered that this code was failing:
        p = create_proc_entry("sys/net/ipv4/osf", S_IFREG | 0644, NULL);
        if (!p) {
                ipt_unregister_match(&osf_match);
                return -ENXIO;
        }
After much *more* head-scratching, and adding of printk's, I tracked it down
into fs/proc/generic.c, in xlate_proc_name:
                len = next - cp;
                for (de = de->subdir; de ; de = de->next) {
                        if (proc_match(len, cp, de))
                                break;
                }
                if (!de) {
                        rtn = -ENOENT;
                        goto out;
It appears that syssctl-reimplement-the-sysctl-proc-support.patch doesn't
bother setting the de->subdir, so xlate_proc_name isn't able to find sys/net.
What's the intended semantics of create_proc_entry and xlate_proc_name in
this new regime of no subdir pointers? Or am I just (yet again) one of the
first to trip over a bug?
