    That's a bogus argument because:
- MMIO isn't much used by the IDE drivers much (normally the inline
   ins*()/outs*() accessors are used;
- that's used only by generic IDE code, not by the drivers about which
   I'veargued;
I've already agreed that the generic code would probably win from using 
ioread*()/iowrite*().

    What IDE indirection you're talking about anyway?
