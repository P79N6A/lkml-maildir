i'd take a 37 lines readability patch even if it didnt give us a byte of 
text back. The fact that it also reduces text size on the latest gcc in 
rawhide is an added bonus. (of course the patch is 2.6.16 material)
in fact we frequently apply patches that _reduce_ readability but which 
e.g. reduce the number of 'current->' dereferences. (That too is 
something the compiler could figure out.)
also, besides the size reduction effect, this patch is also a 
speed-micro-optimization.

i agree with you that other low-hanging fruits exist, but this does not 
diminish the value of this patch. The patch is obviously correct, it is 
cleaner and improves size and speed. Size reduction alone does not 
necessarily trump cleanliness, but in this particular case all factors 
show towards acceptance.
furthermore, i think that even if it's a small step, we should encourage 
every effort that reduces the kernel's text size. The 2.4 -> 2.6 
transition blew up the kernel by ~50%, and we've got to win back some of 
that. (Kernel size is one of the main disadvantages of Linux in the 
embedded market, compared to other OSs.)
