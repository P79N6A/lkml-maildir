Subject: [PATCH 15/51] [GFS2] Ensure journal file cache is flushed after recovery
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is for bugzilla bug #248176: GFS2: invalid metadata block
Patches 1 thru 3 were accepted upstream, but there were problems
with 4 and 5.  Those issues have been resolved and now the recovery
tests are passing without errors.  This code has gone through
41 * 3 successful gfs2 recovery tests before it hit an
unrelated (openais) problem.  I'm continuing to test it.
This is a complete rewrite of patch 5 for bug #248176, written by
Steve Whitehouse.  This is referred to in the bugzilla record as
"new 6" and "a different solution".
The problem was that the journal inodes, although protected by
a glock, were not synched with the other nodes because they don't
use the inode glock synch operations (i.e. no "glops" were defined).
Therefore, journal recovery on a journal-recovering node were causing
the blocks to get out of sync with the node that was actually trying
to use that journal as it comes back up from a reboot.
There are two possible solutions: (1) To make the journals use the
normal inode glock sync operations, or (2) To make the journal
operations take effect immediately (i.e. no caching).  Although
option 1 works, it turns out to be a lot more code.  Steve opted
for option 2, which is much simpler and therefore less prone to
regression errors.
