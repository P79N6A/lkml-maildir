There can be mapped files that can't be mapped into the migration task.
.
Here's an example (courtesy of Jack Steiner);
  	sprintf(fname, "/tmp/tmp.%d", getpid());
  	unlink(fname);
  	fd = open(fname, O_CREAT|O_RDWR);
  	p = mmap(NULL, bytes, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
  	close(fd);
  	unlink(fname);
  	/* "p" remains valid until unmapped */
The file /tmp/tmp.pid is both mapped and deleted.  It can't be opened
by another process to mmap() it, so it can't be mapped into the
migration task AFAIK how to do things.  The file does show up in 
/proc/pid/maps as shown below (pardon the line splitting):
2000000000270000-2000000000278000 rw-p 00200000 08:13 75498728  \ 
/lib/tls/libc.so.6.1
2000000000278000-2000000000284000 rw-p 2000000000278000 00:00 0
2000000000300000-2000000000c8c000 rw-s 00000000 08:13 100885287 \ 
/tmp/tmp.18259 (deleted)
4000000000000000-4000000000008000 r-xp 00000000 00:2a 14688706  \ 
/home/tulip14/steiner/apps/bigmem/big
Jack says:
"This is a fairly common way to work with scratch map'ed files. Sites that
have very large disk farms but limited swap space frequently do this (or at 
least they use to...)"
So while I tend to agree with your concern about manipulating
one process's address space from another, I honestly think we
are stuck, and I don't see a good way around this.

Yes, I agree.  Let's make that so.
