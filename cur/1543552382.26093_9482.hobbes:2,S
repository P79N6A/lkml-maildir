Sorry if this is user-error, but after about 20min of using
2.4.0-test10-pre5, my Debian Woody system dropped out of X with this
message in syslog:
[drm:drm_release] *ERROR* Process 256 dead, freeing lock for context 1
I've never seen this before; I had been using test10-pre4 for several days
without error.
Is this a kernel bugglet/error, or X?
