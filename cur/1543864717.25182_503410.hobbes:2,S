That may be partially true. But the main reason is that the rt2x00
team chose to depend upon the heretofore unmergeable devicescape stack.
In contrast, the bcm43xx driver had a port for the ieee80211+softmac
stack that was ready for merge much earlier.  This is more a result
of confusion in one area of kernel development than an indictment of
Linux drivers in general.
FWIW, we are closing-in on a merge for the devicescape stack.
(No, really!)  So, hopefully wireless will soon cease to be such a
fertile ground for bad examples...
Thanks,
John
