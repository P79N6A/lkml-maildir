Should not be relevant, I think. I expect the kernel version is more
important here (correct me if I'm wrong). Just in case it _is_ relevant:
  kalman:/# mount --version
  mount: mount-2.7l

Sorry, I forgot to mention that I used the same values for rsize and
wsize. I just remounted the /usr/it filesystem with
"defaults,rsize=8192,soft,wsize=8192,nolock" with the following results:
  kalman:/# mount
  [snip irrelevant lines]
  server1:/usr/it on /usr/it type nfs (rw,rsize=8192,soft,wsize=8192,nolock,addr=aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd)

As you can see in the log, the problem is repeatable.
The strange thing is that "ls /usr/it/packages" doesn't go wrong. Maybe
the "nohide" option in the server's exports file confuses Linux? For
historical reasons I need /usr/it/images, so removing the nohide option on
the server is not a preferable option.

The nfs(5) manpage says it is for performance reasons.
