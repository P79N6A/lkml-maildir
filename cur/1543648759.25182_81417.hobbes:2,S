Linux has always read the partition table at first use AFAIK. So if you
have never used a drive you can repartition it and then use it, but once
you use any one partition the table is not reread.
I *think* if you unmount all partitions (including swapoff swaps) you can
see changes, but that's from memory, I haven't tried it in a long time.
Don't believe it's a bug, it's a design decision.
