This is so incredibly incorrect.
There is consensus on making network stacks able to use this
address space.  And that is all that the patch does.
The consensus is only missing on whether to make the address
space public or private.
This is also clearly spelled out in the draft.
It is important to get as large of a head start on this as
possible because of how long it takes to deploy something
like this.
