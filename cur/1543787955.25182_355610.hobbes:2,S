Huh, I thought that the first line in a unified patch started with
"---", and that the lines above were treated as garbage. Relying on
"diff -" or "Index: " seems wrong. Try diffing two files by "diff -u
file1 file2" and look at the output - the first line is "---"... This
extra "---" you are proposing seems like a workaround to me.
