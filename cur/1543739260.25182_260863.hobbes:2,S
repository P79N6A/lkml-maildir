Locking in tasklets needs to be done the same way locking in interrupt 
handlers is done.  The only caveat that I can think of is that in the 
event that you are accessing data shared with code that runs outisde of 
the tasklet, you probably need to use spin_lock_bh to disable softirqs 
in the latter code.  In your environment, it would typically replace the 
use of spin_lock_irq[save|restore].
