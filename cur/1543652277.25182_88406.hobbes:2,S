Hi,
 I have experienced extreme low STREAMS numbers (about 600 MB/sec for Triad) 
on two dual CPU systems based on the ServerWorks GC-LE chipset (SuperMicro 
P4DLR+ mainboard). Both systems had 2x2.4 GHz XEONs, 4GB of DDR memory and 
were running kernel 2.4.18. I would usually expect STREAMS numbers of about 
2000 MB/sec for this kind of systems.
Does this ring any bells?
Martin
