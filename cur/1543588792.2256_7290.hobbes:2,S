A warning about agcc, I've discovered that it does not always compile code
quite the way you expect it.  This is unsurprising given it's based on
pgcc which is known to change alignments on you in ways that sometimes
break things subtly.
I do not know if agcc actually can produce code which simply does not work
as is reported with pgcc (I suspect the alignment differences account for
many of those cases), but I recall reading in the past few days that agcc
is not supported for compiling the kernel.
It also fails to properly compile certain other programs, notably anything
that includes asm functions.  As a result, my own experience suggests you
consider agcc in the same class as gcc 3.0 at the moment - experimental.
Hopefully the k7 optimizations that work well will find their way into a
nice athlon subarch options in standard gcc and agcc won't be necessary.
