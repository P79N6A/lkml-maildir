I guess you mean official -pre releases as well?
Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

P.S. I only track `real' (-pre and -rc) releases. I don't have the manpower
     (what's in a word) to track daily snapshots (I do `read' bk-commits). If
     m68k stuff gets broken in -rc, usually it means it won't get fixed before
     2 full releases later.  Anyway, things shouldn't become broken in -rc,
     IMHO that's what we (should) have -pre for...

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
