I think you are correct...  I habitually do a kill -1 <pid of inetd> to
make it reread the inetd.conf file...  ditto for inittab and init.  
However, we have several dozen solaris boxes and this works on them as
well...  we don't reboot for such minor changes at all, just a friendly
kick in the rear with kill -1 and the daemon will reread its config
file (and even log the fact that it did this).
The only config changes that make me reboot any of my linux boxes here
is when I either install a new kernel or modify an existing one by
changing the source and recompiling.  Then a reboot is needed...

I am totally lost.  A UPS is something you plug your computer in to
and then forget it.  It maintains power across power
failures/transients/etc.  There are some that will plug into a serial
port and give you warnings when the power goes down, up, etc.  Is that
the type you are talking about?

there are lots of such powermonitor daemons for linux that will start
at boot, grab the serial port, and listen for the UPS to tell them
something bad. Then they can fire off a shutdown -h 5 or whatever type
of shutdown you want

that is the price of a bare-bones battery-backup UPS.  I haven't seen
one that will give you status over a serial port for that price...
