I'm not sure what you're referring to there.  The idea that loader
should parse library pathname and /proc/mounts output, and thereby
enforce "noexec" by itself, rather than relying on the kernel's
mmap implementation to enforce it?  Well, I'm glad I won't need
to implement that, since the kernel's mmap _is_ doing the check,
and I still see no reason to change that after all this time.

I'll leave comparisons of security to those who know what they're
talking about.  But again and again I have to point out, just
because "noexec" has proved inconvenient to you here, does not
imply that it's useless everywhere, and does not imply that
the kernel should change its behaviour to suit you.

There might be a loader which specifically seeks to avoid the
mmap check, by mmapping without PROT_EXEC then mprotecting with
PROT_EXEC.  Whether that's an argument for or against now adding
the test to mprotect depends on your standpoint.
But I think I've already said all I have to say on this.
