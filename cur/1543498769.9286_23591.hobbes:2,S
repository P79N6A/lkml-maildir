Hi:
I've got a builtin Modem in a Sharp A150 laptop.  In Lose98, it says
it's a Rockwell K56Flex HSP PNP modem, and uses IRQ 4 and memory
addresses 3F8-3FF.  With redhat 5.2, stock kernel or 2.2.4, both serial
ports are invisible.  For example, running kermit, selecting /dev/cua0,
/dev/cua1, /dev/ttyS0, or /dev/ttyS1 gets "/dev/xxxx is not a terminal
device".  In the BIOS, I've tried PNP on and off.  The BIOS says the
modem has the address given above and the serial port has IRQ 3, address
2E8-2EF.  Does anyone have a clue how to make the serial ports work?
