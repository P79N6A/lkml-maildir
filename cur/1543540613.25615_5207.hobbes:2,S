Here is a PIC version that Alan Modra posted a while ago:
#define _syscall5_pic(type,name,type1,arg1,type2,arg2,type3,arg3,type4,arg4, \
          type5,arg5) \
type name (type1 arg1,type2 arg2,type3 arg3,type4 arg4,type5 arg5) \
{ \
long __res; \
__asm__ volatile ( \
        "pushl %%ebx\n\t" \
        "movl %%eax,%%ebx\n\t" \
        "movl %1,%%eax\n\t" \
        "int $0x80\n\t" \
        "popl %%ebx" \
        : "=a" (__res) \
        : "i" (__NR_##name),"a" ((long)(arg1)),"c" ((long)(arg2)), \
          "d" ((long)(arg3)),"S" ((long)(arg4)),"D" ((long)(arg5))); \
__syscall_return(type,__res); \
}

Borislav
