.. and deprecating pm_send_all, cli, sti, restore_flags, check_region yadayada
has really been a great success at motivating people to fix those up too.
How about we fix up some of the existing noise before we add more?
A build log of a fedora kernel I had handy shows 165 deprecated warnings
that have been there forever.  Your proposal will add over 500 warnings
in drivers/ alone.
