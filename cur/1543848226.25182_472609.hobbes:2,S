No.  1 table.  2 consecutive targets with different stripe sizes, if that's
how the data is actually laid out.

Depends whether or not you give precedence to the stripe size.
The underlying device might be much larger - dm doesn't know or care - and
the intention of userspace might have been to truncate a larger striped
device part-way through one of the stripes - an equally reasonable thing to
do.
