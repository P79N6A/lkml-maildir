Thats the way ZONE_DMA works right now and AFAIK the only way forward is 
to make it optional and then introduce another way of allocating memory
for a device. The migrate away from it. The first step is to allow people
who do not need ZONE_DMA to opt out.

I think you are spreading FUD. The existing scheme has been working for a 
long time. Come up with something concrete. I am not 
changing the definition of ZONE_DMA.

Exactly. But you cannot do that with ZONE_DMA __GFP_DMA. We likely need a 
new page  allocator API for that.

Maybe they have not been reading linux-arch? It was discussed among arch 
maintainers and 4 arches have switched off ZONE_DMA for good.
