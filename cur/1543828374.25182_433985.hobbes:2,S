Not really.  Today, people use reiserfs even though they couldn't
just remount their old ext2 as reiserfs.
An ext2/ext3-incompatible ext4 isn't a problem.  Sure, people will
have to mkfs instead of just remounting, and that will mean fewer
quick conversions in the short-term.  But people using ext3 today
don't really need ext4 - they are per definition running on sufficiently
small disks/partitions.
So an incompatible ext4 will still see use - on new filesystems mostly.
Not a problem, people buy disks all the time.
