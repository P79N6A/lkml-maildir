Now I'm asking our test team about that.
Again, from glibc-2.3.3(RHEL4b2):
[nptl/sysdeps/pthread/pthread_cond_wait.c]
   85 int
   86 __pthread_cond_wait (cond, mutex)
   87      pthread_cond_t *cond;
   88      pthread_mutex_t *mutex;

   91   struct _condvar_cleanup_buffer cbuffer;

   98   err = __pthread_mutex_unlock_usercnt (mutex, 0);
   99   if (__builtin_expect (err, 0))
  100     {
  101       lll_mutex_unlock (cond->__data.__lock);
  102       return err;
  103     }
  104
  105   /* We have one new user of the condvar.  */
  106   ++cond->__data.__total_seq;
  107   ++cond->__data.__futex;
  108   cond->__data.__nwaiters += 1 << COND_CLOCK_BITS;
  109
  110   /* Remember the mutex we are using here.  If there is already a

  117   cbuffer.cond = cond;

  137       lll_mutex_unlock (cond->__data.__lock);

  153         goto bc_out;
  154

  156       val = cond->__data.__wakeup_seq;
  157     }
  158   while (val == seq || cond->__data.__woken_seq == val);
  159
  160   /* Another thread woken up.  */
  161   ++cond->__data.__woken_seq;
  162
  163  bc_out:
  164
  165   cond->__data.__nwaiters -= 1 << COND_CLOCK_BITS;
  166
  167   /* If pthread_cond_destroy was called on this varaible already,

  171       && cond->__data.__nwaiters < (1 << COND_CLOCK_BITS))

  180   /* Get the mutex before returning.  */
  181   return __pthread_mutex_cond_lock (mutex);
  182 }
I'm not sure but it seems that the pseudo-code could be:
(mutex must be locked before calling pthread_cond_wait.)
-A01 pthread_cond_wait {
+A01 pthread_cond_wait (futex,mutex) {
+A0*   mutex_unlock(mutex);
  A02   timeout = 0;
  A03   lock(counters);
  A04     total++;
  A05     val = get_from(futex);
  A06   unlock(counters);
  A07
  A08   sys_futex(futex, FUTEX_WAIT, val, timeout);
  A09
  A10   lock(counters);
  A11     woken++;
  A12   unlock(counters);
+A1*   mutex_lock(mutex);
  A13 }
(and it's better to replace var "futex" to "cond".)
Is it possible that NPTL shut the window between mutex_unlock()
and actual queueing in futex_wait?
Thanks,
