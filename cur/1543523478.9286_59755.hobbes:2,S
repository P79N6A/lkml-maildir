They specify how the KERNEL should respond when it finds itself
running a syscall that needs to return a 32-bit off_t but has a value
too big to fit in one.

Providing that's been done for ALL of the utilities on the system,
this discussion is irrelevant as the proposed scenario could not
arise. However, if there's just ONE utility that hasn't been compiled
with that flag (including those supplied in binary-only form) then
there is the possibility of it happenning.

That's fine for applications and utilities, but note that this is the
KERNEL development list. You may also like to remind yourself of the
question I responded to, which I will paraphrase to clarify it:
 Q. What should the kernel do when, in the middle of executing a
    function that returns a 32-bit off_t value, it finds itself
    referring to a file whose length is too large to be stored in
    such a value?
My reply can be summarised as follows:
 A. If the value to be returned fits into the 32-bit off_t value,
    return that, otherwise return -ETOOBIG and expect the program
    to deal with it if it actually cares about the value returned.
I believe such is reasonable, taking into account the fact that many
programs ignore these return values anyway. As an example, if I've
just read a record from a file of fixed length records and wish to
overwrite it with an updated copy thereof, I would see nothing wrong
in using something along the lines of the following code:
	if ((fd = open("File-of-records.dat",O_RDWR)) == -1)
	    perror("prog");
	while (read(fd,record,sizeof(record)) == sizeof(record)) {
	    /* Process record */
	    if (record_updated) {
		(void) lseek(fd,-sizeof(record),SEEK_CUR);
		write(fd,record,sizeof(record));
	    }
	}
	close(fd);
Assuming this program has been compiled with settings that result in
it using the 32-bit version of lseek, why should it fail if the file
being processed is 10G in length? It cares not what the return value
from the lseek is - indeed, it doesn't even bother to store it - and
only requires that the file pointer be moved back to the beginning of
the record that has been updated.
The only reason this might fail would be if the record itself was over
2G in size, and I have never yet designed a record that large.
Best wishes from Riley.
