And flag every other process, that the flagged process is
communicating with?  How are you proposing to do that?
Quoting Paul:
"1. The freezer cannot be guaranteed deadlock-free without constructing
   a dependency graph between tasks (both user and kernel), which is
   virtually impossible since the dependencies are not externally
   observable."
