I experienced the very same problem but with window size going all the 
way down to just a few bytes (14 bytes). dump files available upon 
requests :)
Ion, how were you able to reproduce the issue ? Can the same type of 
traffice always reproduce the issue or is it more intermittent ?
Best regards,
Guillaume.
