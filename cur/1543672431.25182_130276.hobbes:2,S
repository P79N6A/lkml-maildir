Subject: [PATCH]: DELAYTIMER_MAX is defined

Hello,
Playing around with the posix timers I've noticed that DELAYTIMER_MAX is
not defined. This constant is specified in the POSIX specifications. It
should contain the maximum possible value of overruns on a signal. It is
also said that the overrun shouldn't overflow. cf
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/functions/timer_getoverrun.html
So here is a patch to add this constant and a check that the overrun
variable never overflow. It's for 2.5.67 but should apply flawlessly to
2.5.69 too.
Actually one could wonder if the test on the overflow is really needed
has an overrun reaching 2^31 seems very hard to happen. However the
constant definition is not hurting anything and looks necessary for
closer POSIX compliance.
