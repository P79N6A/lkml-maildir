For this it's not trivial, but seems to be, on the surface, rather easy to 
accomplish.
Since the driver is controlling all aspects of the system - memory and the 
like - and doing DMA to/from that memory for userspace accesses why not use 
one of the built-in framebuffer fonts and draw the panic directly to the 
video memory of the current screen?
Of course there are some times when this might not be possible - most notably 
during a display mode switch.  In that case I have no solutions, because when 
a Panic happens you have no guarantees about the state of the system.
Perhaps have the video-hardware re-initialized on a kexec after the panic and 
provide some way for the new kernel to display the panic information?
