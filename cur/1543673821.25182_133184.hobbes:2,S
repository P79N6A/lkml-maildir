think if there are two truncates, one zapping the entere file, and
another restoring the previous i_size, in such case the new_page will be
wrong, as it won't be zeroed out. I mean if we do anything about it, we
should close all races and make it 100% correct.
My fix has no scalability cost, no indirect calls, touches mostly just
hot cachelines anyways, and addresses the multiple truncate case too.

the only thing I can imagine is an app trapping SIGBUS to garbage
collect the end of a file. So for example you truncate the file and you
wait the SIGBUS to know you've to re-extend it. it would be a legitimate
use, and this is a bug, it's not read against write that has no way to
synchronize anyways, however I doubt any application is being bitten by
this race.
