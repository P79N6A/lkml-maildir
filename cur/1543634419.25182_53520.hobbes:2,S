Yes, the hardware is at fault.  I don't have money for 
other hardware though, so working around it seems a good idea.  
We could simplify the IDE driver a lot by dropping support for
all the broken controllers too. Or tell
people to not use DMA on them.
Of course such an option should default to OFF, and
perhaps live under "dangerous."  It can keep the
BP6 going much longer, which is good enough
for a home machine.
Failing due to a stuck NIC after one week seems worse
than crashing due to a scrambled IPI after some months.
There are more interrupts than IPI's.
This sort of fix don't really make things worse, the 
theoretical scrambled IPI will happen without it too.
The safe solution is NOAPIC, this fix simply makes it work
for a longer time using the bad apic.

Unfortunately not.  I got a nice PSU when I ordered the BP6, 
thinking that power was the only issue. (It was the only
cheap dual solution at the time.)
