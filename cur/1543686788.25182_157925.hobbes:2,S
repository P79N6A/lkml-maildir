Agreed. A high-level driver must be able to handle this anyway because of
other constraints. The point is that this costs cpu cycles and bouncing
should be avoided if possible.

Agreed. This just enables the high-level driver to avoid bouncing. For
instance, in a P4 system it is usually not necessary to require 128 byte
alignment for DMA.
