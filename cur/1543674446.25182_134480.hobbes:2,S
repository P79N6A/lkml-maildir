Members of the LTC and OSDL(TM) have been working on a project
to study Linux (R) 2.5 performance on Hyperthreaded platforms.
We have results from running the OSDL-DBT2 OLTP workloads where
we compare 2.4.21rc1* to 2.5.68* and 2.5.68* with Ingo's
sched-2.5.68-B2 patch.  We also investigated HT scaling by
comparing the metrics with 2.5.68* having hyperthreading turned
off.
We see exceptional improvement(64%)comparing 2.5.68 with HT on
versus HT off with the Cached CPU intensive workload. Surprisingly,
we also see very good improvement (22-23%) with the non-cached I/O
intensive workload.
This could be because we use the SAPDB parameter MAXCPU set to 8 
matching the number of user task threads to the number of logical 
CPUs in the HT case. Although there are many more threads created, 
these 8 threads are very active.  This scenario may represent the 
case where CPU affinity and load balancing are at their optimal 
situation.
We see very little difference between the 2.4 kernel and the 2.5
kernels having hyperthreading turned on for either workload.  As we
understand, stock 2.4.21 doesn't have O(1) scheduler, stock 2.5.68
has O(1) scheduler, and stock 2.5.68+Ingo has hyperthreading patch ...
when the workload is subjected to those 2 schedulers, neither helps.
Any explanation?  
Here are the details:
