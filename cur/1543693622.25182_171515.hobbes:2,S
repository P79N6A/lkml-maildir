I confess that my first reaction to this topic was that I could add an
attribute when starting a thread, and then use existing code (pthreads)
and just take advantage of the non-fd-sharing.
Pseudo code: (some of the if's are clearly ifdef)
  if linux add_noshare_to_attributes
  for (;;) {
    fd = listen();
    start_thread(fd)
    if linux clode fd
  }
Clearly that isn't what's needed, I would probably define a
start_service_and_close_fd_ifUcan macro/procedure. When this is stable
and 2.6 is closer to production quality I will probably modify a few
applications to see what benefits might be available.
