Oops, you're right :)

That logic doesn't work.  If you believe that, then the core kernel
needs to be doing 100% of the request_region calls, right at bootup...
If XFree86 not fbdev is using the hardware, you can always have a stub
driver that does nothing but reserve the ports.  Remember, too, that the
ports claimed depend on register settings in the video card and PCI
config space..
