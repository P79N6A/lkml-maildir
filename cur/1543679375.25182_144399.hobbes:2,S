Arjan,
Driver is in development stage, so I have given u an 
overview of how my interrupt handler looks like.
As u can see below, I am doing some minimal processing
in ISR and scheduling a tasklet for reamining
work(like allocating buffers and cleanup). 
But problem with this is that tasklet ends up on same
cpu. I want some method where by I can make use of 
second cpu, so that second cpu does the work what 
tasklet is doing(i.e allocating buffers and clean up).
Please don't give a solution based on irq affinity to
second cpu, as we have only one interrupt.
void my_isr(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs
*regs)
{
/*Mask interrupts on the device */
write(register, nomore interrupts);
/*do some minimal amount of processing to 
read data provided by the device*/
do_basic_read(dev_id);
/*schedule tasklet and give it remaining work.*/
tasklet_schedule();
/*Unmask interrupts on device*/
write(register, start generating interrupts);
}
Regards
Raghava.
