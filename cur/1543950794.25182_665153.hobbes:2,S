Subject: [PATCH 0/2] kgdb: Fixes and regression tests

To aid in the porting of additional archs for kgdb as well as to
continue to check that new changes have not broken kgdb, a kgdb test
suite has been created.  The objective is to test the kgdb core and
some features of the arch support such as SW/HW breakpoints, SMP
concurrency, single stepping and the NMI watch dog.
By default the kgdb test suite would not be compiled into the kernel.
It main purpose is to test kgdb internals.
Running the regression tests against kgdb has found several problems.
The first patch in the series addresses the regressions found from
running the kgdb test suite.  The second patch in the series is the
kgdb test suite itself.
Jason.
