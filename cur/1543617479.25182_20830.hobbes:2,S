In the 2.5 kernels this is done when you use the BUG_ON macro that is
defined as follows:
#define BUG_ON(condition) do { if (unlikely((condition)!=0)) BUG(); } while(0)
BTW: Note that likely/unlikely doesn't has any effect for most of us
     because __builtin_expect is only available in gcc >= 2.96.
