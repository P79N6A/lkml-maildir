I think they are a virtual file of some kind:
[root@mason ~]# ls -l /proc/4361/fd
lrwx------  1 root root 64 May 12 12:35 3 -> socket:[41460]
lr-x------  1 root root 64 May 12 12:35 4 -> pipe:[41496]
l-wx------  1 root root 64 May 12 12:35 5 -> pipe:[41496]
These "files" (socket:[] and pipe:[]) have a dentry in sockfs and 
pipefs (you can't mount the fss, but they are there, see /proc/filesystems)
