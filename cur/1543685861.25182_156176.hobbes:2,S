(Davide already did the global cpu limit)
No, there is no DoS possibility, but it feels a little... unclean.  It 
doesn't appear to accomplish anything other than bypassing 'you must be 
this tall (godly stature) to use this API'.  No matter what limit you put 
on the cpu usage, that amount can (xlat: probably will) be abused.

On my little box, I'd have to relinquish control of over 50% of my cpu at 
_minimum_ to some random application developer.  (not)

Oh, I'm sure it'll work.  What I tested briefly worked fine.  However, I'm 
not sure that it's a good (or bad) idea.
