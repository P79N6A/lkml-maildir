On 32-bit Linux/MIPS we have a special address range from 0x80000000 -
0xa0000000 named KSEG0 which is mapped to physical address zero.  This area
is part of the architecture, that is doesn't need a TLB entry.  This also
implies that using KSEG0 limits Linux/MIPS to 512mb memory at most.
For 64-bit CPUs 8 additional address spaces of 2^40 bytes and reserves to
grow them for future architecture versions are available.  These address
spaces are also 1:1 mapped to physical address zero, thus raising the memory
limit to 1TB.
In short, for kernel memory Linux/MIPS never ever takes TLB faults, so why
having page tables for it at all ...
