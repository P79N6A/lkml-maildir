Because renaming breaks things for no good reason.  "list_head is
ugly" is insufficient cause: it doesn't cause bugs (cf. skb_realloc).
You want to clean up some ugliness?  Find every
list_for_each/list_entry pair and substitute list_for_each_entry().

I did: see the patch.
Really, I don't care whether it's "struct list_head" or "list_t", but
both is stupid.  And since struct list_head is backwards compatible,
that's the winner here.
As someone who has been slowly feeding ISO-C declarated initializers
into 2.5, I am acutely aware of the cost of widespread change.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
