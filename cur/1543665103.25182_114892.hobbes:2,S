Heyas.
With the 2.5.x series of kernels I've lost serial port functionality of
my xircom pcmcia card and the network port, whilst working, does give
errors on eject. The dmesg from an insert/eject sequence is:
cs: cb_alloc(bus 2): vendor 0x115d, device 0x0003
PCI: Enabling device 02:00.0 (0000 -> 0003)
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 02:00.0 to 64
eth1: Xircom cardbus revision 3 at irq 10 
PCI: Enabling device 02:00.1 (0000 -> 0003)
ttyS15 at I/O 0x1880 (irq = 10) is a 16550A
Trying to free nonexistent resource <00001880-00001887>
cs: cb_free(bus 2)
When accessing the serial port (ttyS15) all I get is:
13 [23:58:06] root@theirongiant:/usr/src/linux>> cat /dev/ttyS15
cat: /dev/ttyS15: Input/output error
I know this card has a real modem in it as I've used it in the past with
some version of 2.4.x and pcmcia-cs package. I'd like to use the kernel
stuff though so that I can stop having to install 4MB or so of modules into
/lib.
If you need any help from me with debugging/testing/whatnot, then please
holler. I'll try to do any testing etc asap.
Oh yeah. Relevant .config options:
CONFIG_PCMCIA=y
CONFIG_PCMCIA_XIRCOM=y
CONFIG_NET_PCMCIA=y
CONFIG_PCMCIA_XIRC2PS=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CS=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECS=y
