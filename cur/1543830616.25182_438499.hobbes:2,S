In the cached HZ case there will be no performance hit of measure
anyway. The bigger problem is existing user space. That is why we've
always kept the user visible HZ based values the same when changing the
kernel HZ. You can't automatically regenerate all the old binaries you
might otherwise break.
Performance is only a minor issue, and I doubt anyone who cared about
performance would be using ia-64 anyway
