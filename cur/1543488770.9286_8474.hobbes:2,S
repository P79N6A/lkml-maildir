while trying to solve a problem for a friend, i came across the following
code:
        if ((card->typ > 0) && (card->typ < 31)) {
                if (!((1 << card->typ) & SUPORTED_CARDS)) {
                        printk(KERN_WARNING
                             "HiSax: Support for %s Card not selected\n",
                               CardType[card->typ]);
                        restore_flags(flags);
                        return (0);
                }
	} else {
...
why do they do:
(1 << card->typ)
if they already checked if card->typ is between 0 and 31 ?
(i think i'm missing something here ;))
