drivers/net/tg3.c was the case where we needed it first. If you grab
the official ia64 kernel patch and look in the arch/ia64/sn/io code
you will find places that consider it.

It's not being used on those platforms because I couldn't implement it
on all of them - I just don't have the hardware. We implemented it on
ia64 because thats where we needed it, Andi Kleen then implemented it
on x86_64 because he needed it there. If there are PPC boxes out there
with similar issues then I am sure that the PPC maintainers will
implement support for this when they need it.

The default for pci_alloc_consistent() on ia32 is that
pci_dev->consistent_dma_mask == 32 bit. If you need something else for
a reason, please feel free to implement support for it.

So *fix* it! This is Linux, it's Free Software, you have the source,
you have the right to fix bugs!
