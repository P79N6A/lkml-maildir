I must say I personally prefer the apparmor approach.  But I'd recommend
you get together and get this piece pushed on its own, whichever version
you can agree on.  Yes it needs a user, but at this point I would think
both tomoyo and apparmor have had enough visibility that everyone knows
the intended users.
It seems to me you're both being held up by this piece, and getting
another full posting of either tomoyo or apparmor isn't going to help,
so hopefully you can combine your efforts to get this solved.
thanks,
