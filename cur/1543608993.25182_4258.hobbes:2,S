Confirm 2.4.13+preempt doesn't cause the problem.
If it doesn't, can you try recompiling with the newest 2.4.13
preempt-kernel patch.  I forget from which version we removed the atomic
operators, but I want to confirm this is not the problem.
Confirm 2.4.14 doesn't cause the problem.
(if possible) confirm 2.4.14+preempt does indeed cause the problem.
Let me just spit out my thinking here:
	Is it preempt?
		Is it something in 2.4.14 annoying preempt?
		Is it the non-atomicity recently introduced?
