This device is claiming that it has a 64-bit base-address which has been
programmed by BIOS to be at 0x80000001d0000000.
I suspect that the 4 bytes at offset 0x14 want to be 0.  The address
0xd0000000 jives with the rest of your PCI listing.
I don't know where that extra 0x80000001 comes from, but it's pretty
clearly wrong.  BIOS bug?  I can't see where kernel would have boned that
up *that* badly.
