Aha... I see.  And in thinking about it, I realize that my motherboard
also has this integrated graphics card.  Perhaps this is the difference?
Unfortunately, it seems they both report the same PCI id, so I don't
really know of a way to differentiate them.

I looked at that datasheet, and the datasheet for the 8363.  Both said
not to program offset 55, and both said the bits we are clearing are
"reserved."  Perhaps we should contact VIA directly, tell them the
problem we're having with their current fix, tell them our theory, and
ask if we're right.
