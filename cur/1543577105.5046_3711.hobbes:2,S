Well.... its a long story.
The interface between knfsd and filesystems is not (currently) a clean
one.  The current interface to filesystems is dictated by the VFS
layer, and it works primarily in terms of names.
knfsd wants to work in terms of inode numbers (or something similar)
and there is no such interface.
knfsd does manage to do its job, but only by abusing part of the VFS
interface - the "iget" routine which calls s_op->read_inode.
iget is meant to be an private interface, only ever called by the
filesystem itself (typically in the lookup operation) but, for ext2 at
least, it works for knfsd, so knfsd uses it.
Basically, knfsd assumes that is a filesystem has "read_inode"
defined, then it can safely use iget.
This works for ext2, but not for nfs.
The nfs filesystem does define read_inode, but uses it quite
differently to ext2.
The net result is that when you try to map an inode number to an inode
using iget with ext2 it always works, but if you do it with nfs it only
works if the inode is already in the cache.
So, when you:
   ls /mnt/A
from C, knfsd on  B1 (or B2) tries to find the directory  'A' and
succeeds beause it is in cache.  It does a readdir on this directory
and gets a list of files including "A.txt".
But when it tries to access A.txt, iget doesn't work for it, and it
cannot find it.
So A.txt is really on A, not on B1 or B2.  But when you look at A.txt
from C through B1 or B2 you only get a blurred image.  You can see
that it is there, but not what it is.
Does that help?
