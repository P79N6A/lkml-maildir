Subject: [PATCH] device_shutdown can loop if the driver frees itself
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/5/195

This patch changes device_shutdown() to use a newly introduce safe
reverse list traversal.  We experienced loops on system reboot if we had
removed and re-inserted our device from the device list. 
We noticed this problem on PPC405. Our PCI IDE device comes and goes a lot.
Our hypothesis was that there was a loop caused by the driver->shutdown
freeing memory.  It is possible that we do something wrong as well, but
being unable to reboot is kind of nasty.
