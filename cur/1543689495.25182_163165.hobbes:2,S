How about something like this that at least gets it closer? It fixes the
fact that incorrect usage of PROT_SEM would allow users to set the
VM_SHARED bit behind the back of the OS, which sounds like a total
disaster and which can potentially confuse other parts of the VM.
It's not a very _pretty_ fix, but there really is no excuse for PROT_xxx
to not match VM_xxx for the three standard protection flags, so in that
sense it is the technically "sane" approach. We might want to just
simplify the mmap() code too..
