TWO actually. I guess you are easily impressed.
A simple cut and paste error.

Yeah, I (fairly closely) mimicked their behavior to make a point.

I know you DON'T believe that, as you are about the tenth person to
repeat that "repeating stuff has no effect."

NO. You people simply come across as zealots who work together, against
Reiser4.
Hence the term "anti-Reiser religion."

I might be. I don't really know how to set it all up.
Perhaps if you guided me through it.

Yeah, I can't see how the OS could read the love-letter either.
But one thing is for sure. The FS ain't responsible for reading it.

It's a tough ask of any FS. 
Microsoft's filesystem checker totally roasted all my data on an XP-box
last night. 
I had used ntfsresize to reduce the partition size and had a power
outage. 
Later, Windows booted, ran the filesystem checker, seemed OK. 
Next time I boot, all I get is Input/Output error.
