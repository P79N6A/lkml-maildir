The enum works fine, though, and has less namespace pollution than a 
#define, so sometimes an enum can be preferred.
HOWEVER. For sanity, if possible please avoid using the value "0". It's 
magic for __bitwise, in that a zero is always acceptable as a bitwise 
thing (which makes sense if you think of bitwise as being about bits: the 
zero representation is totally independent of any bit ordering).
So it's better to start counting from 1 if possible.

sparse doesn't care. Whatever scans better for humans. Attributes like 
"force" parse the same way things like "const" and "volatile" parses, and 
while most people _tend_ to write "const int", it's not incorrect to write 
"int const". Same with "__attribute__((force))", aka __force.
