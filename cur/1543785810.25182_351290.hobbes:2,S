Subject: Eradic disk access during reads

Monitoring disk access using gkrellm, I noticed that a command like
cat /dev/hda > /dev/null
shows eradic disk reads ranging from 0 to 80MB/s on an otherwise idle system.
1. Is this a hardware or software problem?
2. Is there a lightweight perf-mon tool (cmd-line) that would log this 
behaviour graphically?
Thanks!
