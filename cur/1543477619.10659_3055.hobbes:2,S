Nice try, but you're probably not a writer by trade!
Too many numbers, jargon and acronyms. Cut by a factor of 10.
Repetition.

For example, getting out my red pen.
The Linux team, a worldwide group of computer hackers led by Linus
Torwalds, now at Transmeta Corp.  in the USA, has released a new
operating system kernel.  The new kernel has been in development for
nearly three years, and will soon be powering the future GNU/Linux
distributions of the popular UNIX-like operating system for the PC,
sparc, alpha and many other platforms.  Hello Linux 2.2!
Etc. etc. Eric Raymond should probably be left to do this!
