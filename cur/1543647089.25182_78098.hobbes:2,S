Right. But that's a driver bug, and it's because this whole thing is 
fairly new.
There aren't that many things that actually play with these things (mainly 
the PCI and the USB layer, and individual drivers shouldn't care, it's 
just the bus layer that does all of this), so we should be able to fix the 
cases cleanly.
