Does aynone know if the hardware that is enabled with
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_SUPERIO is available on PCI devices? The functions
detect_and_report_winbond() and detect_and_report_smsc() poke at random
legacy IO ports. I just wonder if they may also find the hardware if
they come from a PCI device.
If they are i386 only, the config option should probably be i386 (or
whatever) only.
