I agree with Paul.  Reset or RIS is (R)eset to (I)nitial (S)tate,
represented as ESC 06/03. "Initial state" is defined in ECMA-48 as the
state of the device after it was made operational. It doesn't
necessarily mean that the "initial state" is the safest configuration.
So, if this "initial state" includes enabling UTF-8, then the device has
to go into UTF-8 upon invoking RIS.
