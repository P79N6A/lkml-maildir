Hi,
the following three patches fix two lockdep warnings I am receiving with 
2.6.18-rc6-mm2 (but at least the first one has been already discussed in 
the times of 2.6.17, reported by Dave Jones) and I can see the problem in 
current mainline source too).
* [1/3] fixes this:
 =============================================
 [ INFO: possible recursive locking detected ]
 2.6.18-rc6-mm2-dirty #4
 ---------------------------------------------
 kseriod/140 is trying to acquire lock:
  (&ps2dev->cmd_mutex/1){--..}, at: [<c02b973b>] ps2_command+0x5b/0x3a0
 but task is already holding lock:
  (&ps2dev->cmd_mutex/1){--..}, at: [<c02b973b>] ps2_command+0x5b/0x3a0
* [2/3] adds support for spin_lock_irqsave_nested(), which is needed by 
[3/3]
* [3/3] fixes this:
 =============================================
 [ INFO: possible recursive locking detected ]
 2.6.18-rc6-mm2-dirty #7
 ---------------------------------------------
 swapper/0 is trying to acquire lock:
  (&serio->lock){++..}, at: [<c02b7a20>] serio_interrupt+0x20/0x60
 but task is already holding lock:
  (&serio->lock){++..}, at: [<c02b7a20>] serio_interrupt+0x20/0x60
All three patches are based against 2.6.18-rc6-mm2, I can rebase them 
against mainline, if needed.
Both warnings have been solved by splitting the respective functions to 
nested and non-nested variants, and calling them from synpatics driver as 
appropriate.
