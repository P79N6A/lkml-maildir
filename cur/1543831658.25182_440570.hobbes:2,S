Actually a queue is congested ---it is, because the queue is too long or
bit BDI_write[read]_congested is set.

The  direct reclaim does not skip any page in pdflush thread because
may_write_to_queue() returns true
if (current->flags & PF_SWAPWRITE) and: __pdflush() sets this flag:
See pfflush.c: __pdflush() first line
current->flags |= PF_FLUSHER | PF_SWAPWRITE;
> Wouldn't this interfere with current->backing_dev_info logic?

It is not need to set current->backing_dev_info for pdflush because
PF_SWAPWRITE is set for pdflush.
The proposed patch does not concern of backing_dev_info logic.

When queue is congested---it is, because meta-data (indirect blocks in
ext[23] case) have to be read in synchronously before page can be paged
out (see comment in mm/vmscan.c:pageout()).
But much more importantly: when direct reclaim skips writing dirty pages
from tail of the inactive list, it instead moves these pages to the head
of this list, and reclaims clean pages instead. These clean pages are
"hotter" than skipped dirty pages, and as has been checked many times
already, this is bad, because doing reclaim in LRU order is important.
