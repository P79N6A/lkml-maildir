Well, sorry for all the questions. I really appreciate
everybody's help and especially Steve for standing up
for me!! All the reasons you cited are true and that
is why I am afraid I cannot post the actual code etc.
There was never a question in my mind that we have to
use the *_user functions. I was just trying to
understand all the corner cases and the semantics of
how things worked when it has not been used. 
Thanks once again.
Signing off this thread.
