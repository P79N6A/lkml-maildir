OK, thanks, that helps heaps.
The code does look OK, so it that's the source of the leak then something
subtle might be happening.
If it _is_ a fget/fput thing then I'd expect files_cache to be leaking too.

Ah.  I guess nobody ever implements compat_getsockopt without also
implementing compat_setsockopt but yes, it'd be tidier to actually check
the thing we're about to call ;)

Thanks again.
