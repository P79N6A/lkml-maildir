sure you're right. and i know that timeslices get asssigned based on
static priority (which is nice value rescaled).

i've read that tasks should start at higher dynamic priority with a
small timeslice (a priority boost for a starting task) then immediatly
drop to a lower priority if it use all it's timeslice.

maybe it's because the timeslice calculation is reversed?
