Hi!
Merry X-Mas everywhere !
So, my USB tryout is over. 
This is the expierience report:
You should not try to use VIA Chipsets + SMP + USB, that's
the worst thinkable idea. It's junk (usb-Part).
That's why:
1. not solved USB Irq errors in APIC mode, causes:
	Error -110, device does not accept ID
	USB Host is recognized fine, no device is attaced
This is an error somewhere in the Kernel APIC Irq routing, which may 
worked around with "append noapic pirq="your irq" but using such a cutdown
USB System is not a good idea, no relly working bulk-transfers (forget 
any devices which depend from it: scanners, camera, sound, isdn, 
harddisks, zip etc.)
State: unusable.
Timeframe to be fixed: Unkonwn, Error Reports open open since 1 year
So now I shutdown an connect the scanner (HP 6350) with a 2nd scsi card.
Ciao
Jürgen Sauer
