Yeah, I was thinking it would be renamed to something smack-specific.
The concept of CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE is pretty general, but then users may
for just that reason expect the capability to also let them override
selinux and other capabilities.
For instance the capabilities equivalent to a CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE would
probably be CAP_SETPCAP, since it can be used to add capabilities back
into your inheritable set.  But we wouldn't want to share one capability
for CAP_SETPCAP and CAP_SMACK_OVERRIDE.  CAP_SETPCAP does let you regain
CAP_SMACK_OVERRIDE, but a process could have CAP_SMACK_OVERRIDE but be
denied CAP_NET_ADMIN for instance, or heck even CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE.
So short answer is: I agree :)
