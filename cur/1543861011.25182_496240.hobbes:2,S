It does seem odd to require that every application using O_DIRECT would 
have to contain code to make it work with tmpfs, or that the admin would 
have to jump through a hoop and introduce (slight) overhead to bypass 
the problem, when the implementation is mostly to stop disallowing 
something which would currently work if allowed.

In many cases the use of O_DIRECT is purely to avoid impact on cache 
used by other applications. An application which writes a large quantity 
of data will have less impact on other applications by using O_DIRECT, 
assuming that the data will not be read from cache due to application 
pattern or the data being much larger than physical memory.

This isn't impacting me directly, but I can imagine some applications I 
have written, which currently use O_DIRECT, failing if someone chose the 
put a control file on tmpfs. I may be missing some benefit from 
restricting O_DIRECT, feel free to point it out.
