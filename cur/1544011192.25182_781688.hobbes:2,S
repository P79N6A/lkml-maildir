Yep - I already have positive feedback from arch maintainers that
they will fix it in the -rc1 timeframe.

I took a different route here and unified the headers for m68k and m68knommu
under arch/m68k/include/asm
It was based on a script originally developed by Arnd Bergmann.
Geert already acked it, and I expect Greg to apply it in the -rc1 timeframe.

 has Geert's ack,
but original patch did not hit marc?!?

rmk knows it and takes care.

Thanks Al.
I will take a closer look at the mn10300 bits and send them to David
in due time.
