Hello,

I cannot ping the machine anymore, no Ooops, no kernel messages, the
attached screen is freezed (which implies that no more interrupts
are handled, right?)

Yes... And it is not the problem, as I make use of interrupt 
sharing on the first three slots.

From 2.2.19 and 2.4.4?

Yes, one could think. But I checked that interrupt handling basically
works for slots 4+5 with "cat /proc/interrupts". As soon as
I start a larger ftp data transfer over an ethernet adapter in
one of these slots the problem occurs.
