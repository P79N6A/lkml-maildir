These two sizeof()s have already been fixed by Randy in -mm's
acpi-fix-printk-format-warnings.patch.
Randy's fix is the preferred one: sizeof() returns size_t and size_t's are
printed with %z - there's no need to use a typecast.
(Actually Randy used %Z which avoids the warning which old gcc emitted with
%z, but is old-fashioned.  I'll switch that to %z).
acpi-fix-printk-format-warnings.patch was submitted to the ACPI developers
on August 14 and on September 25 but remains unmerged.
