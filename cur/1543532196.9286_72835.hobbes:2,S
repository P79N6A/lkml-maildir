It's fine in current 2.2 kernels.

Not surprising, since what perl is doing is trying to set the file
size to 4294967295!

What is happening is that after the write() returns an EDQUOT error,
perl's tell function is returning an error (-1), which is being
passet to ftrunacate().  If you are seeing the size set to this odd
value it is because the kernel is treating it as an unsigned int
and casting it to the large value 4294967295.  That's actually a
legal file size in 2.3, as we now have large file support in the 
kernel.
So it's basically a bug in your program, as you are not checking for
whether tell() returns an error code or not.  However, there is 
probably a kernel misbehaviour being reported here, since the kernel
should not allow a file to be ftruncate()d to a size larger than 
2GB if the file wasn't opened with the appropriate large file
flags.  I'll check that.
