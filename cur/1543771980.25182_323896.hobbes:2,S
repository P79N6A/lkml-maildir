As an aside...
Never forget that hardware vendors _always_ want their latest stuff to 
the default <whatever>.  :)
In the grand scheme of things, I really don't see why we need to rush 
into anything, on the PCI MSI front.  Support exists.  Drivers work 
as-is today.  Is it terribly urgent to default PCI MSI on in 
pci_enable_device()?
Things are still shaking out with regards to broken devices, and broken 
system chipsets.
