I'm not convinced here. It's rather easy to come up with a scenario 
where more than 16 packets are lost, hence the timestamp wraps around 
and you have the impression that no packets are lost. Losing 16 packets 
is a serious issue in streaming audio, so we definitely have to be able 
to detect this.
The point is that currently we use the cycle value for every callback 
since that's how the libraw API is defined. So if our current code is 
supposed to work with the new kernel modules through the adapted libraw 
it obviously has to provide the cycle parameter for every callback. 
Therefore I suppose the discussion is about a new API that is being 
designed.

If we can calculate the cycle a packet is received on one way or 
another, we are ok. So whether this is done by receiving a cycle value 
for each packet, or having the cycle for the first packet in a batch and 
then using offset calculations it is ok. The only precondition for this 
is that a batch should be continuous, i.e. there should not be any 
missing packets in a batch. Only between batches.
We will probably only be able to comment on this thoroughly once we 
start implementing the juju based streaming system. I don't see this 
happening in the next 6 months though.
Greets,
Pieter
