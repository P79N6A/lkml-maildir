A recent change to JFS has the resize code determine the volume size 
from sb->s_bdev->bd_inode->i_size.  However, LVM doesn't update this 
size when resizing the volume, so JFS doesn't see the new size until 
the volume is completely unmounted and re-mounted.    A fix to revert 
to an earlier behavior that should work is in Marcelo's bk tree and 
will be available in -pre4.

It looks like you tried to mount the volume with the "resize" flag.  
This flag is only valid for remount, as the message in the log states.

I'm sure this is a real bug in JFS.  I'll take a closer look at the code 
and let you know what I find.

I suspect that NFS had nothing to do with the resize problems.  I wasn't 
aware of problems with locks & nfs on jfs volumes.  One more thing for 
me to look into.
Thanks,
