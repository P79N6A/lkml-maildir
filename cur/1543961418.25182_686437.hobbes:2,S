Subject: [PATCH 0/8] CPU-Hotplug: Fix CPU-Hotplug <--> cpufreq locking dependency

Hello everyone,
A couple of months ago Zdenek Kabelac had reported a Circular locking
dependency in resume, which was related to the locking dependency
between the cpufreq and CPU-Hotplug subsystems.

This patchset aggregates the various patches that have been posted in
the recent past, to solve this problem.
There are a few more TODO items in CPU-Hotplug , unrelated to
this problem, that cropped up in the various discussions.
They will be posted in a seperate thread.
The patchstack has been lightly tested on a 4-way x86 machine with
CPU-Hotplug running in parallel with kernbench and changing cpufreq
governors simultaneously.
Awaiting your feedback,
gautham
