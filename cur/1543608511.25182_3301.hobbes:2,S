Architectural failures like "C" or "C++" for example.
Strong type information (in one form or the other) is absolutely fundamental
for achieving correctness in this kind of software.
You can't just have a "data thingy" and hope your "operator thingys" do
what you suppose they do, and that your "storage thingy" has enough room
for what you shovel into it.
C has types for a reason.  C++ improved the type system for a reason.  Perl
and PHP programs have run-time failures for a reason.
