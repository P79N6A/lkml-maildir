I really like the source browser on linux.bkbits.net.
Is there a way to browse to a file and see which rev is in which kernel
version?  The closest thing I can find is that if I follow the 'CSet'
link, sometimes the Rev data is yellow and has what I'm guessing is a
tag.  But this is clearly not comprehensive.
eg, arch/i386/kernel/apic.c doesn't come close to telling me which is
the apic.c found in (say) 2.4.21.
If there's a way to do this directly from the source browser, that'd
be perfect, but also if there's a way to correlate it somehow with
data I can get elsewhere that's fine too.  eg, from the "start page"
at linux.bkbits.net, if I go to 'Tags', I can find the 2.4.21 tag
("MailDone v2.4.21" I guess is it) and click 'later CSets' but that
information doesn't seem particularly helpful in finding 2.4.21 apic.c.
(Obviously, I'm not even really sure how to read that data.)
thanks
