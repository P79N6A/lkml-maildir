If those Apaches _might_ conceivably all enter mod_perl at the same time
and run a tricky script, and you want to _guarantee_ that nothing can
die, 800MiB is the correct vm requirement.
Your choice.  Use 60MiB and accept that there are conditions under which
the Apaches can die, or buy a bigger disk and claim that they cannot.
(Heavily swapping Apaches are probably worse than dead ones, but that's
your choice to make).
