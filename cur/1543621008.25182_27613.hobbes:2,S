This is also why software raid 5 + IDE is a bad combo. It has a high 
chance of locking up the IDE controller, and requiring you to power down 
& fix the system before reconstruction can commence. However with SCSI 
hot-swapable solutions, on-the-fly reconstruction after failure works 
perfectly.

I am using software raid 5 and several Dell PowerEdge 2550 servers 
(since the hardware raid was to slow for some heavy IO operations), with 
great results. We have had 5 seperate disk failures so far, and no 
problems what so ever. Either the spare disk kicked right in, or after 
adding the new drive, reconstruction work perfectly.
I don't know if 20 PE2550 servers qualifies as a 'enterprise' solution,
but it works great for the kinds of thing we are doing
