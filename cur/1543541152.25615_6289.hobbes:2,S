 That doesn't mean serial.c doesn't handle it.  If handle_sysrq() exits
without an action, then serial.c just drops the just received character
(if any) on the floor and also the next one provided it arrived in the
SysRq recognition interval.  So it needs to be fixed anyway.

 Ugh, I admit I haven't actually checked it even though I should have to. 
But this poses a problem in serial.c (and possibly other serial drivers,
too) -- it needs to check if SysRq is enabled even before calling
handle_sysrq().  Otherwise the character immediately preceding the BREAK
condition gets lost for no reason.  When handle_sysrq() gets finally
called, it's already too late -- the chacter have already been lost.
 I don't think it's feasible to introduce sysrq_enabled() function or
alike now that the variable is to be local.
