There's also the question of testing status.  We know that the dynticks
patches in -mm mostly work.  Now that they appear to have been largely respun,
we don't know that any more.  Then if we go adding more stuff on top, problem
identification becomes harder.
I thought that dynticks/hrtimers was a done thing: in fact $certain_people wanted
them in 2.6.20.  The late-breaking rip-up-and-rewrite was rather unwelcome.  But
I haven't got onto reading the patchset yet.
