Eric, Linus,
I tried the 3-patch series "[PATCH 0/3] Basic msi bug fixes.." and they fix this 
problem for me. Were you expecting the OOPS in the first place? In any case, it 
survived several suspend/resume cycles on both enabled (irq alloc'd and enabled) 
and disabled devices (only initialized).
Jens Axboe was seeing the same problem, perhaps he can confirm the fix as well.
In any case, the patches have my blessing :)
Please add my:
