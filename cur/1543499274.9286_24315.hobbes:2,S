Not always. Especially if there are no support in hardware :-)

No. x + 1 < x, but ((long) (x+1)) > ((long) x)... What's wrong here ?

And here we have MAJOR problem: there are NO easy replacements for some
such things used in linux kernel. Yes, it's not portable but what's can be
done ? EVEN if kernel is broken just stating that "such code is not portable
and so it's not our problem" is NOT ENOUGH. Some workaround is needed. And
workaround without speed loss and supported on all supported platforms !
