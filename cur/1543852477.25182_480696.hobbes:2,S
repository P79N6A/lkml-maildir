Subject: [patch] fix up generic csum_ipv6_magic function prototype
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The generic version of csum_ipv6_magic has the len argument declared as
__u16, while most arch dependent version declare it as __u32.  After
looking at the call site of this function, I come up to a conclusion
that __u32 is a better match with the actual usage.
Hence, patch to change argument type for greater consistency.

asm-m32r and asm-parisc both have it declared as __u16. I think it is a
copy-n-paste error and needs to be fixed by arch maintainer, I hope.
