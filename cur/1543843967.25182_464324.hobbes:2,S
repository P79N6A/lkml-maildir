Thanks for this Olof it has sparked some ideas about how to redo
support for multiple operations.

I think we should keep the operation type in the function name but
drop all the [buf|pg|dma]_to_[buf|pg|dma] permutations.  The buffer
type can be handled generically across all operation types.  Something
like the following for a pg_to_buf memcpy.
struct dma_async_op_memcpy *op;
struct page *pg;
void *buf;
size_t len;
dma_async_op_init_src_pg(op, pg);
dma_async_op_init_dest_buf(op, buf);
dma_async_memcpy(chan, op, len);
