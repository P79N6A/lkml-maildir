yeah - but i didnt want to impact something so large as XFS. Such a 
change has to be tested and validated - so i wanted to get the namespace 
collision out of the way first. But i'd be happy to add an XFS 
conversion patch ontop of these, provided someone tests it.

right now the lock is gone from the debugging state once it's unlocked.  
I'll add mutex_destroy(), it should be rather easy (it can e.g. destroy 
mutex->magic).
