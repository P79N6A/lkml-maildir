Gentlemen,
I recently puchased a NIC driven by an Asix 88140 chip.  The board shipped
with a GPL'd Linux driver derived from Donald Becker's tulip.c.  FWIW, the
Tulip driver recognizes the board but won't drive it.  The driver as
shipped (ax88140.c) won't compile for 2.2 kernels.  I've modified the
driver for 2.2 kernels and attached a patch against clean 2.2.5 kernel
sources.  The patch modifies drivers/net/Config.in and drivers/net/Makefile
and adds drivers/net/ax88140.c and drivers/net/crc.h.
Regards,
