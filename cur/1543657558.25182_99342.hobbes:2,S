I changed the report generator for ctxbench slightly after the recent 
discussions of system call methods. I added a column of context loop rate 
divided by MHz of the processor, and ran on the same or similar 2.4 
kernels (this is a hardware thing, version matters only a little).
What it showed was a piss-poor value for the P4, best for my old P-II 
Celeron, and Athlon vs. P-III closely swapping third place. In fact the P4 
had a value about 3x slower than the P-II.
If someone wants to run the benchmark with the old and new system call 
setup it might be useful to quantify the gain.
Benchmark is at www.unyuug.org/benchmarks, and if someone tests this I'd 
like a copy of the raw results for my collection as well as the extract 
posted to lkml.

  Having the feature freeze for Linux 2.5 on Hallow'een is appropriate,
since using 2.5 kernels includes a lot of things jumping out of dark
corners to scare you.
