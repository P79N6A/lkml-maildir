Hi,
The following two patches are intended to deal with the problem that some
CPU hotplug notifiers misbehave when they are called after tasks have been
frozen.
The first of them introduces special notifications that should allow subsystems
to distinguished normal CPU hotplug events from the ones that occur during
a suspend/resume, and the second makes the microcode driver actually use them.
Greetings,
Rafael
