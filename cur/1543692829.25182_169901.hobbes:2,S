Well, it's a subtle detail, and it would be well to document such. He
may be the only person to use that, but it's certainly not intuitive,
and if I were to ever do this I'm certainly alerted that it might
violate Plauger's law of least astonishment. I would hope it points to
the thread, but if it doesn't it's not something I use every day ;-)

When I get this one built I'm going to see which getpid() (and family)
returns as well, I never though of using /proc/self from a thread, but
I do on rare occasions get my pid.

Hopefully that was an unintended side effect.
