no, not "All false positives", the first checkpatch failure is a blatant 
ugliness that you introduced:
 ERROR: use tabs not spaces
 #137: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode.c:248:
 +^I^I          EXT_SIGNATURE_SIZE * i;$
because you converted a tab to a sequence of 10 spaces:
-		ext_sig = (struct extended_signature *)((void *)ext_header
-			+ EXT_HEADER_SIZE + EXT_SIGNATURE_SIZE * i);
+		ext_sig = (void *)ext_header + EXT_HEADER_SIZE +
+		          EXT_SIGNATURE_SIZE * i;
                <........>
(the second checkpatch warning is a false positive.)
and i applied your patch before i notified you, but apparently you 
couldnt be bothered to check. Please do not bother to send patches with 
such an attitude, it's just a waste of people's time.
