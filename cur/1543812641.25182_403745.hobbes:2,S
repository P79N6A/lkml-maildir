OK, thanks.  The first iteration of that patch caused ia64 to go BUG, so we
took the BUG out.  We're calling init_emergency_isa_pool() on ia64 which
seems rather silly.  So my confidence level in that patch remains low, and
our need for it is high.

OK, there were some fairly large DM patches touching on
dm_get_device().  Cc added ;)
