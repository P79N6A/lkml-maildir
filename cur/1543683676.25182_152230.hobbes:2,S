hi,
man hdparm says:
"-Y
 Force  an  IDE  drive to immediately enter the lowest power con-
 sumption sleep mode, causing it to shut down completely.  A hard
 or soft reset is required before the drive can be accessed again
 (the Linux IDE driver will automatically handle issuing a  reset
 if/when  needed)."
but when i put my hdd in "sleep mode" (not suspend, that works fine) it 
shuts dowm properly but can not be woken up again... when shutting down the 
system, it hangs waiting for the hdds to come up again, but they never do...
i'm using kernel 2.4.20, IDE drives on a debian testing system.
any suggestions why the ide driver does not soft-reset the drives as 
implied in the hdparm man-page?
Johannes
