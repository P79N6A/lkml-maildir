mem->phys_device = kobject_get(kobj);
is probably better, as you are storing a pointer to a kobject, so you
need to increment its reference count.

kobject_put(mem->phys_device);
mem->phys_device = NULL;
is a better way to do this.
And yes, the sysfs_create_link() function does increment the reference
count of the kobject, but it's better to be safe :)
