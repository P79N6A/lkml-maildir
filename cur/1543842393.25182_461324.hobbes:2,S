Dave,
I have to apologize. Reiser3 seem to be the one deadlocking here
actually. Changing /home to reiser4 still deadlocks.
Now, reiserfs-developers:
would you want me to keep the filesystem around to try to test patches
or potential fixes or can I wipe it out?
The good thing is that the deadlock is 100% repeatable, the bad thing is
that this laptop has a broken cdrom and I have to take the drive out and
fsck it via usb1.1 each time. :)
Thanks
