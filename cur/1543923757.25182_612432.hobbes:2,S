that is ,the VM could be preempted by xen,and could xen hypervisor also
be preempted to reschedule other vm or xen kernel thread?and are there
the counterpart abstractions in xen for kernel thread in linux?

that is ,the patch makes the guest's kernel, rather than xen, be able to
be preempted ,is it right?
Thanks in advance
