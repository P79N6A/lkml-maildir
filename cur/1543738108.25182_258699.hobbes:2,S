The patch is made somewhat larger by a lot of variable renaming because
of the removal of sched_groups.  A lot of s/group/domain/.  The vast
majority of the changes are in a rewrite of arch_init_sched_domains &
it's assorted helpers.

I wasn't trying to imply that CPU hotplug isn't supported right now. 
But it is currently a very disruptive operation, throwing away the
entire sched_domains & sched_groups tree and then rebuilding it from
scratch just to remove a single CPU!  I also understand that this is
supposed to be a rare event (CPU hotplug), but that doesn't mean it
*has* to be a slow, disruptive event. :)

The current code doesn't, to my knowledge support multiple isolated
domains.  You can set up a single 'isolated' group with boot time
options, but you can't set up *multiple* isolated groups, nor is there
the ability to do any partitioning/isolation at runtime.  This was more
of the motivation for my code than the hotplug simplification.  That was
more of a side-benefit.

Yes.  I have to put my thinking cap on snug, but I don't think my
version would support this kind of setup.  It sounds, from Jesse's
follow up to your mail, that this is not a requirement, though.  I'll
take a closer look at the IA64 code and see if it would be supported or
if I could make some small changes to support it.
Thanks for the feedback!!
