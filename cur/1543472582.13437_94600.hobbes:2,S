What about the many people who are great at coming up with ideas
(inventing) but are incapable or unwilling to manufacture the devices
they invent?  Without patents, if someone came up with an idea for a
device, the only way he could make _any_ money off of it would be for
him or his company to find a way to manufacture it.  If he attempted to
sell the idea to a production company, the company would listen to the
idea, reject his offer, and build his device without permission.  This
is bad.  Of course, what happens now is also bad.....  I say: shorten
patent life; get rid of software patents; get rid of patents on ideas
(other than specific devices+specific methods).
