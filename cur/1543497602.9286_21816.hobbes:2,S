One of my servers committed suicide yesterday morning by killing init via
oom(), along with syslog[1], named, and httpd. Probably due to the web
server getting out of hand. Stock Redhat 6.0 2.2.5 kernel.
Shouldn't init be spared from SIGKILL or at worst re-execed? 
Funny thing is, it was showing up with pstree, so I was rather puzzled
that things weren't respawning until I found an empty spot at slot 1 with
ps.
[1] Making it hard to figure out what happened.
