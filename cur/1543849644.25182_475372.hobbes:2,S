Stacked GIT 0.11 release is available from 
http://www.procode.org/stgit/.
StGIT is a Python application providing similar functionality to Quilt
(i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of GIT. These
operations are performed using GIT commands and the patches are stored
as GIT commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGIT patches into
other repositories using standard GIT functionality.
The main features in this release:
*  New 'float' command to bring a range patches to the top of the
stack. This command can also take a series file as a parameter,
allowing easy reordering of the patches
* Patch history support, accessible through the 'log [--graphical]' command
* Use the '..' syntax for patch ranges instead of ':'
* '--keep' option for 'pop' to preserve the local changes (useful to
add the modifications to a different patch)
* '--graphical' option for 'series' to invoke gitk instead of listing
the patches
* Automatically generate patch names for the 'import', 'pick' and
'uncommit' commands
* '--noreply' option for 'mail' to not send messages as replies to the
first one. This is useful for mailing lists filtering replies with a
different subject
* '--interactive' option for 'resolved' to invoke a graphical 3-way
merge tool (xxdiff or emacs)
* '--sign' and '--ack' options for 'refresh' to sign off or acknowledge a patch
* Diff colouring pager script added to the contrib directory
* Configurable low-level pull command (i.e. git-pull)
* '--auto' option for 'mail' to automatically cc the patch signers
* Debian package support files
* Bug fixes
