It would appear that way, if not for something I neglected to mention in
my first message--the ioctl is on the fd for the opened serial port.
This succeeds in other version of the kernel (as described in my
original posting) and so must somehow be valid for the serial driver.
Any more thoughts?  This would seem to be a definite bug in the serial
code.
