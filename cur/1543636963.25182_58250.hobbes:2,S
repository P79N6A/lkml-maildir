Actually I've looked it up in my copy of the last C99 draft:
	[#5]  This  edition  replaces  the previous edition, ISO/IEC |
	9899:1990,   as   amended   and   corrected    by    ISO/IEC |
	9899/COR1:1994,    ISO/IEC   9899/COR2:1995,   and   ISO/IEC |
	9899/AMD1:1995.  Major changes  from  the  previous  edition |
	include:
	[some stuff snipped]
  	  -- trailing comma allowed in enum declaration              |
So please let it in.
