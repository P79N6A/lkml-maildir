I do have a 2 lines patch to the common ide code that fix a problem when
revalidating a CD-ROM after sleep, but it was ack'ed by Andre Hedrick. I
also have a two-liners to kernel/printk.c to allow takeover of my boot
console by the real vt subsystem (I found no way for a struct consw to
take over a struct console without this patch). I'll make sure those are
separate from the main patch set.
I need some time to do some polishing and slicing all those patches so
you don't get a single hundreds kb diff, expect something around this
week-end. I leave out some fbdev stuffs that may cause problems with
other archs.
Ben.
