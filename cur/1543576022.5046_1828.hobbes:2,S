The current VT (fg_console) and /dev/console are 2 different things ...
/dev/console might be /dev/ttyS1. Besides to get at fg_console
we already have ioctl(/dev/tty0, TIOCLINUX, 12)
There is currently no way to find out with what device /dev/console
is associated.
Why is that needed? For example, I wrote a program 'bootlogd' that opens
/dev/console and a pty pair, uses TIOCCONS to redirect console
messages to the pty pair so they can be logged. However one would
like to write those messages to the _actual_ console as well, but
there is no way to find out what the real console is.
For this application a ioctl is better than a /proc symlink since
it would be started before /proc is even mounted.
Mike.
