LANANA isn't ignoring 2.6.  Linus mandated they shouldn't accept new
allocations for 2.6 anymore - but given there's very few 2.6-only drivers
this hasn't been much of a problem so far.  Or to quote from
Documentation/devices.txt:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
THE DEVICE REGISTRY IS OFFICIALLY FROZEN FOR LINUS TORVALDS' KERNEL
TREE.  At Linus' request, no more allocations will be made official
for Linus' kernel tree; the 3 June 2001 version of this list is the
official final version of this registry.  At Alan Cox' request,
however, the registry will continue to be maintained for the -ac
series of kernels, and registrations will be accepted.
