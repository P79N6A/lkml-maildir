-Wa,-mev64 was a typo, I meant -Wa,-mev4. My question was geared to what
happens when you don't have a ev6 machine. My AS400 4/233 is an ev4
machine. Will the generated code work well?
Every test kernel I've built so far fails to mount the root file system,
fails to open a console, or just stops after the step in which it
releases memory (init, kflushd, kupdate, and one other are running, but
the boot sequence fail)
