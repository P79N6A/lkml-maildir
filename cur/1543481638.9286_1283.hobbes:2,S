I would have assumed that the compiler would perform the division only once,
as both the division result and the modulo remainder should be available
simultaneously after the division -- although admittedly my assembly 
experience is limited to x86 only.  Do other architectures require 
separate operations for integer division and modulo division?
I do admit the division is expensive; 486 tables show 43-44 clocks.  The
multiplies show as 13 clocks (best case); I can't seem to find my Pentium
references.  I would assume it is somewhat faster, but am not sure.

I bow to you on this; I'm not even sufficiently sure of my understanding of
the kernel internals to call myself a novice.

If this is the case, the algorithm I presented would definitely fit the bill;
Marsaglia's analysis software showed zero high-order correlation in any of
the tests on the output of this algorithm.
