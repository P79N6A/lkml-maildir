Yeah, but we have a ton of machines (thinkpads among them) with ATI, and
other GPUs.
Whitelists would need to be reasonably specific, anyway (not "all
thinkpads"), so it just means "don't do it on certain R50e", or whatever.
It is no easy problem, and the fix might not be as simple as one could wish,
either.
