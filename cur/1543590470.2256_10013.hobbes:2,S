Sorry for my noise!
My problem was NOT fast_page_copy related.
It was Justin's aic7xxx 6.1.12 release.
His latest 6.1.13 (2.4.4-ac6) fixed it for me.
My MSI MS-6167 (AMD Irongate C4) is running very well with APIC (it haven't 
really have one) and ACPI (latest) enabled.
Below are some MMX copy results.
Thanks anyway.

BTW Where can I grep the bench with MB/sec output?
