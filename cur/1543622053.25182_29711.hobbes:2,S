 That's interesting. Probably moreso for Manfred. I'll double check
 I didn't goof merging the oom-handling patch tomorrow.

 -dj includes a different input layer to Linus' tree, which requires
 some extra options enabled.  Vojtech, this is quite a frequent
 'bug report', and I think if you merged that with Linus, the number
 of reports would climb. Is there a possibility of simplifying the
 config.in somewhat? Or at least changing the defaults to give the
 element of least surprise..

 That one I've not got an answer for. Can you give me more information
 about your disk layout, partitions, number of disks, scsi?/ide?/lvm?
