They are inherently seperate entities, I don't think mixing them up is a
good idea. IO priorities also includes things like attempting to
guarentee disk bandwidth, it isn't always just a 'nice' value.
But lets not get carried away in a pointless discussion. The actual
setting and query interface for io priorities is by far the smallest and
least critical piece of code :-)
