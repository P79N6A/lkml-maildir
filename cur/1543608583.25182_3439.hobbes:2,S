Unfortunately i haven't tested that patch so i can't provide an objective
comparison. In which case are there patches for -ac? because if not there
might also be other factors influencing the "perception" of improved
interactivity, this is mainly because i'm doing "tests" by just plain
using the box for an extended period instead of "real" scientific tests.
