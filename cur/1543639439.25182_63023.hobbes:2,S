This will only provide the performance benefic when `aligned_malloc'
return "fresh" memory, i.e. memory that has never been written to.
Assuming most programs use plain old `malloc', which could be taught to
align nicely, then the optimisation might occur when a program starts
up, but later on it's more likely to return memory which has been
written to and previously freed.  So the performance becomes unpredictable.
But it's a nice way to optimise if you are _deliberately_ optimising a
user space program.  First call mmap() to get some fresh pages, then
call read() to fill them.  Slower on kernels without the optimisation,
fast on kernels with it. :-)
