C99 includes a list of additional guarantees made by many C
implementations (in an informative index).  I think we really should
check this list (and the list of implementation-defined behavior) and
document the choices made by GCC.  In fact, this documentation is
required by the standard.

We have seen much trouble in this area before, but I doubt we can
avoid all of them by proper documentation.  Quite a few people seem to
write some C code, check that it works, look at the generated machine
code, and if it seems to be correct, the C code is considered to be
correct.
