this is right because a distribution can't afford to have kernel for a
lot of cpu generation because of disk space problem because you've to
provide a minimal (disk/cdrom/network but no sound/dri/... stuff) boot
kernel, and a UP and a SMP kernel for each generation (as some drivers
've problem in SMP mode but not in UP), ...
And i think (i didn't test it) that this driver won't made a panic on
i386.
So add stuff for next generation (and as this driver can be compiled as
a module, it won't eat some ram on i686- machines) is not a problem as
either it don't panic (eg PIII patches on PII) or it's the
responsability of the super user to test it (eg load the microcode
module).
But what i means is that putting in source some code that _will_ cause a
compilation error to happen is not a good stuff in the kernel. You have
at least to say it in the doc. There are at this moment enough
compilation problem with forgoten dependencies to add some explicit
ones...
see you.
