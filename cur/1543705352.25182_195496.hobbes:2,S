One possibility is the migration request will be in 
CPU 0's queue and not in CPU1's? Hence there won't be anything (in 
CPU1's migration request queue) to process when CPU1 is brought down.
However by the time migration thread on CPU 0 gets around to processing the
request, CPU1 is already down and hence the check.
