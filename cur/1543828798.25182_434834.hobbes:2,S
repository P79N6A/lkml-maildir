On Intel chipsets just enabling it is fine - i haven't heard of a MSI problem
there so far. Detecting Intel chipsets can be tricky though - there are
AMD systems with Intel PCI bridges now. I suppose any blacklist will be 
per bridge.
Just on AMD there seems to be no PCI-X bridge that actually works with MSI without
hacks and PCI-E seems to be quite spotty too (e.g. BCM at least partly broken) 
Brice claims BCM can be fixed with a quirk and Petr claimed AMD 8132 can be fixed
with a quirk, but my personal feeling is that it is very risky to do so because
if these bits are not enabled by default they are likely unvalidated and might break
in subtle ways under high load (past experiences with forcing hardware features
on against BIOS wishes were usually negative) 
The good message is that AMD without quirk they don't do anything so it would just
not be enabled and at least not break anything.
BCM seems to need a blacklist to force MSI off (or at least tg3 is complaining
that MSI doesn't work). I guess we can try to contact someone at BCM
and ask them if they actually tested it. If they did then enabling it would
be fine.
NForce4 PCI Express is an unknown - we'll see how that works.
