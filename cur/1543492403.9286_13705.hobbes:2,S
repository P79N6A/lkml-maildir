Although a bit unsolicited, I have 68030 numbers at hand; this is quite
a bit old CPU, not the top of the line, bit IMHO the most affordable, in
fact, about half of the registered Linux/m68k owners have machines with
a '030 (well, me too :)
On this chip, a shift (independent of count) takes about 4-10 clock
cycles, depending where the shifted operand is; arithmetic operations
are similar (or a few cycles faster), but a multiplication takes 28
cycles (in register only) with 16 bit values, and 44 cycles for a 32-bit
multiplication.  I'm out of touch with the discussion, so I don't know
how often do you want to compute hashes, and even less who cares about
the '030; but I think it's quite common, and multiplication here takes
significantly more time.
It's quite common therefore to optimize constant multiplies to
bit-shifting, but it depends on the value if this is better.
