Thank you for developing that patch.  I have made two changes to it.
Firstly, your patch does not work on a kernel built with module versioning.
it is necessary to use EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS instead of EXPORT_SYMBOL to
make this symbol available, since it is a jump label with no matching
C prototype (although, I am keeping your declaration and use
of FASTCALL, on the assumption that perhaps it is possible
to call that snippet of code as a subroutine in the way that
prototype implies).  Secondly, I have made the minor change of
grouping your extern declarations with other SMP-related extern
declarations in i386_ksyms.c, because that is the way the file is
organized.  I have attached the patch below.
I have built a kernel with module versioning and it successfully loads
a module that uses __{read,write}_lock_failed (unix.o in this case).
Linus, I encourage you to apply this patch if you see nothing wrong with
it.
