Thanks :) but my "complaint" was really that it was suggested that
compiling the kernel (or rather, evaluating certain Makefile variables)
as root was akin to crossing a busy freeway blindfolded or something.
This all goes back to a disappearing "/dev/null" which apparently may have
been an isolated incident.
