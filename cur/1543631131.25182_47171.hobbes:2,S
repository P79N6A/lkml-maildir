alan: let me check what you're saying: despite the fact that lspci -vv
shows the relevant information, there is still a problem? 
the problem is either in the BIOS or its an issue with the kernel not
knowing which IRQ router to use when setting up the interrupt? sorry
to be repetitive, but i'm just trying to check that i fully understand
this.
