Your patch has an odd way of achieving that goal, modify the real
location of the assignment instead of overriding something. That has the
potential to turn into another confusing bug later on, wondering why the
heck your return value isn't being passed back.
Improvement is welcome though, you can't distuingish -EAGAIN on the
input side from the output side currently.
