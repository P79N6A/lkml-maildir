Modules.conf is not all there is. What if modules.conf resides on an
scsi-harddisk with an scsi controller who is just making the problem of
ancient hardware in the first case ? etc.etc. You are running around with
the underlying assumption that you can - indeed - *acess* modules.conf via
*already detected* hardware. This is not the same assumption my textfile
example operates from. My textfile-for-kernel operates from the assumption
that *almost nothing whatsoever* on hardware is "fixed compiled" in the
kernel at the moment we're talking about it, and that the precompiled
modules will probably be loaded from the distro cd etc....
