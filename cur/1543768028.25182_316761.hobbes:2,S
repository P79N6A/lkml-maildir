I'm not sure I know what you mean by 'internal suspended drives' that  
aren't spun down? For every device known on the sata "bus", we do the  
standby routine.
There is room for improvement for software suspend, notably it is  
extremely annoying that we cannot tell the difference between  
'freeze' and 'suspend' currently, this adds overhead for suspend-to- 
disk both in time spent and actual drive wear due to an excessive  
spin down+up cycle.

Heh woops, I usually don't sneak those in with other changes. I think  
this one got in because I actually had another change there that I  
later reverted.
