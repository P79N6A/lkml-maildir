There may be a chance that cdrdao provides a better starting point,
readability-wise.  It seems to be simpler in what it does, and I've
tended to have a better success rate with it than with cdrecord on
"normal" usage.  Of course, it does not (or did not) include the
advanced usage cdrecord supports (various writing modes, multisession,
who knows what else).
