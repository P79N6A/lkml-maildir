devfs is long dead and gone.  It's going to be much easier for you to
probably just change your userspace config to handle this.
If you need any help doing this, please ask on the linux-hotplug-devel
mailing list, where lots of people can help you out.
Or, just add the CONFIG_DEVFS config option to your .config, and build
devfs into the 2.6.15 release.  The code is still there...

There's nothing we can do about out-of-the-tree kernel versions, see
Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt about why you should get those
modules into the main kernel tree.
And before you say, "but they are only for some very odd and not popular
devices, no one would want them in the kernel tree!", remember that we
have whole arches that are only run by about 2 users.  I know
specifically about a few drivers that only work on 1 device in the whole
world.  So this isn't a good excuse :)
Your other issues sound like they will be fixed with the latest kernel
version, if not, please let us know.

Then what do you expect us to do?  And what are those costs?

I hear sf.net hosts patches for free :)  I know of a specific big distro
vendor that likes to burry their patches there to apease the letter of
the GPL, and make it hard for others to figure out where the code is...
