Hi there
I got the 2.5 series functional here for the first time by changing the
mount options on one of my filesystems.  It would crash everytime syslog
tried to write to /var, which was mounted
rw,sync,data=journal,nosuid,nodev
I changed it to rw,nosuid,nodev and the box is now happy.  I'll change
it back sometime to capture the oops if someone cares.
