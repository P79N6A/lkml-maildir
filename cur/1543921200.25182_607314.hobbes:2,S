 Well, I have now recalled what the issue is -- we just plainly and simply 
want to avoid a hardirq spinlock for the very reason we do not do all the 
processing in the hardirq handler.  The thing is we make accesses to the 
MDIO bus with the phydev lock held and it may take ages until these 
accesses will have completed.  And we cannot afford keeping interrupts 
disabled for so long.
 So the only way is to make the check for the HALTED state lockless and 
make sure any race condition is handled gracefully and does not lead to 
inconsistent behaviour.  Which I think as of what we have in the 
net-2.6.24 tree is the case, but there are never too many eyes to look at 
a piece of code, so if anybody feels like proving me wrong, then just go 
ahead!
