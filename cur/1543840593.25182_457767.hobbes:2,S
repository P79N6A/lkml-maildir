You might want to consider disabling NFS data cache revalidation on swap
files since it doesn't really make sense to have other clients change
the file while you are using it.
If you do, you could also skip setting PG_private on swap pages, since
there ought to be no further races with invalidate_inode_pages2() to
deal with.
