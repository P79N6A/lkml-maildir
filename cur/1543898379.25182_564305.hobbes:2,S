I think that just dilutes the real point.  It's not a choice between
locking and volatile - the locking must be there regardless.  It's a
correctness issue; if the result happens to be more readable too that's
a bonus.
If somebody wants to put this sentence in I won't object, but I don't
think it really improves the document either.
Thanks,
