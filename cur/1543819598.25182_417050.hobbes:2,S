Hi Rudolf,

You can have a check now. I uploaded some code. Need to retest it, but it
has been working on my v2.6.5 test machine.

We should add this indeed. it's usefull for testing drivers also :-)

Yes and no: cobalt needs it in it's notifier reboot part which is not part
of the generic watchdog device. But I think the option should be available
if you go sysfs.

Don't agree here: boot_status is a copy of the status at boot. the status
itself can change during normal operation. and thus get_status must return
the "devices status" at that moment.

I think we want to review the temperature stuff in the kernel in general.

And I like the idea to look at it as a hwmon.

I still have to look at your driver in detail, but my first thought would
be that the private part here would be a link to this common device structure.
(see what I did with the example softdog implementation in the experimental tree).

It's not about different approaches: we have to find the best thing for watchdog
devicesi, so the best thing is to talk about pro's and con's and see what we should 
do best. (I for instance didn't come to the sysfs part yet of my code (which would
be in watchdog_sysfs.c)

My view:
to start we should keep one /dev/watchdog, but we should create/define a suitable
sysfs interface that makes it possible to have multiple watchdog devices running 
in parallel. We will need this functionality in the future when a system will 
consist of different processors that all have their own memory and some basic
I/O interfacing.
Later on we will then see what we will do with /dev/watchdog.
Greetings,
Wim.
