The root directory, '/' is changed, and if the process is capable of using
chroot, it may change the root directory again. Works as defined.

As long as root has more than a safe subset of capabilities, root can escape 
a chroot.
Besides that, fchdir on open-at-chroot fds does not decrease the security, 
since the attacker needs help from the outside root, who is not restricted 
by chroot.
I'm more concerned about abstract unix sockets, they could be used to 
send a file descriptor to compromised daemons and extend exploits to
the outside of a chroot and across namespaces - at least I suspect it.
The whole f* family of syscalls would be affected. This can be cured by
e.g. not allowing to receive fds if the root+namespace do not match.

The good guys don't cd out, they open the instalkler archive, chroot to the 
new system root and extract it there. Then they chroot back using the saved 
cwd.

As in jail()?
As far as I know, the new virtualisation features sneaking into the kernel  
will allow implementing a jail, too, in a more secure way than any hacking 
on chroot can give.

There are implementations of chroot which imply chdir(), and not having f* 
functions, they can not _directly_ acces files outside the chroot. But as 
long as they can e.g. mknod /dev/mem or strace, they can do anything.
So let's not put a fingerprint sensor on that chinese paper door.
