M$ created this because their whole filesystem hierachy is a joke,
and cause of this problem, they need to do it in order to save disk space,
just try to count the number of duplicated library under windows and compare
it with the number of duplicated library under linux, and more widely Unix...
On my system, there is *no* duplicated lib...
And i have shell script which inform me if there is...
My personnal thinking is that linux don't need this stuff.

 It is well known that M$ product don't make a free() after a malloc(),
the unix community wish them good luck for their future developement.
