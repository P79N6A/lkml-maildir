Kernel 2.2.15-pre9 locks solid on a MediaGX based box with the message:
    Too much work in interrupt on uart401 (0x330): UART jabbering??
when the midi device (/dev/sequencer) is accessed.  It also complains
once (harmlessly it seems) on boot.  When the device is accessed,
the kernel is history.
I'm working with a few boxes using Cyrix MediaGX cpu's and
the Cyrix CX5530 chipset.  I'm compiling the kernel using
    CONFIG_SOUND_SB=y
    CONFIG_SB_BASE=220
    CONFIG_SB_IRQ=7
    CONFIG_SB_DMA=1
    CONFIG_SB_DMA2=5
    CONFIG_SB_MPU_BASE=330
    CONFIG_SB_MPU_IRQ=5
to use the builtin sound blaster emulation.  These settings match
those of the MPU401 device (set via the BIOS).
Has anyone made the MPU401 work with a MediaGX?  
Have I missed something obvious? 
 -Erik
