I misunderstood about crypto_alloc_tfm().
BTW, ecryptfs and reiser4 are still using crypto_alloc_tfm().
Should we mark it as __deprecated?

- __crypto_alloc_tfm() should return -ENOMEM on kzalloc() failure.
  But it returns NULL.
- crypto_alloc_base() may not return -EINTR on signal_pending()
I'll fix the patch and resend with more clear description later.
