I see. Current devices I have just consumes power from USB host. I.e.
they able to boot using only USB and discharged battery. :-/ Even
more, HP iPaq hx4700 able to charge battery from USB (using that driver).
We just setting USB charging GPIO, and it starts consume power from
the host.
But I got the point, and yes I can't explain why it works correctly.
(1) Anyway, you're hinting that you'd want to see some
"usb_vbus_start_consume_power(how much)" callback, which will be
handled by gadget driver? Or it should just start using some gadget api?
Or even pda_battery must become an "usb power supplicant" gadget itself
to consume power by law?

I'm stuck in null-modem century, so don't wonder my USB-dumbness.
Will read 
http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget/h2-otg.html,
 of course.
Though I'd appreciate answers for (1), thus I can think in right
direction from the start.
Much thanks for your comments.
