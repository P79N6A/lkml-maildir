it needs an existing IOAPIC chip, which is not present in the majority of
single-processor systems.
what is wrong with clearing the first performance counter before using it?
The NMI oopser is completely nonintrusive.
so on UP systems you'll have to choose between the NMI oopser and other
uses of the first counter. You can save/restore the contents of the first
counter if you want to reactivate the NMI oopser. This is all user-space
policy, the kernel doesnt mind.

they are delivered by the IOAPIC, to one (or more) of the local APICs via
the APIC bus, the local APIC then (after IRQ arbitration) interrupts the
CPU core.
