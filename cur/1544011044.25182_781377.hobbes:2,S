OK, after glancing at the strace output again, I see that the seek
offsets are much more linear in the XFS case, whereas they are pretty
random in the ext3 case.  I guess that this is connected to the order
of the files in the maildir, which depends on the FS type.  So this is
a bug in mutt which makes reading the header cache dead slow if the
files are in an inconvenient order.
Thanks to Goswin Brederlo for hinting at the seek offsets.
