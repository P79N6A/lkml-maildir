Patch below.
This small patch insures that cpu_khz is adjusted on cpufreq
notifications even when the tsc timesource is not in use. It fixes the
mostly cosmetic issue when using the ACPI PM timesource of /proc/cpuinfo
not being properly updated when cpu frequency was lowered. 
Please let me know if you have any additional feedback.
