Yes, I wanted to make use of readlink() instead of open()/read()/close()
to access each unknown capability.

What about using symlinks for the name files and text content for the
numeric ones? You could even drop the names/ and codes/ subdirectories too:
$ cat /sys/kernel/capability/20
cap_sys_pacct
$ ls -l /sys/kernel/capability/cap_mknod
lr--r--r--  1 root root 64 Feb  8 08:26 cap_mknod -> 27
$ cat /sys/kernel/capability/names/cap_mknod
cap_mknod
Cheers
Andrew
