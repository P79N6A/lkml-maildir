I think what you're describing here is just the standard old
smp_call_function() deadlock, rather than anything which is specific to
intel-rng, yes?
It is "well known" that you can't call smp_call_function() with local
interrupts disabled.  In fact i386 will spit a warning if you try it.
intel-rng doesn't do that, but what it _does_ do is:
	smp_call_function(..., wait = 0);
	local_irq_disable();
so some CPUs will still be entering the IPI while this CPU has gone and
disabled interrupts, thus exposing us to the deadlock, yes?
In which case a suitable fix might be to make intel-rng spin until all the
other CPUs have entered intel_init_wait().

But that seems to be a nice change anyway.  It took rather a lot of code
churn to do it, and it does find it necessary to export stop_machine_run()
to modules, but that seems OK too.
