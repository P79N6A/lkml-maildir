OK, this is something else.
Making the shift to the extension .ko allowed the syntax:
make fs/ext2/ext2.ko or whatever module we want to build.
Thats very nice when developing on a module to speed up things.
As of today you can actually do:
make fs/ext2/file.o
make fs/ext2/file.lst
make fs/ext2/file.s
make fs/ext2/file.i
and the above mentioned with a .ko module.
There is also the possibility to do:
make SUBDIRS=fs/ext2
and I hope that the following syntax will be anabled as well:
make fs/ext2/
