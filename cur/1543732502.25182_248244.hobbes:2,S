Firstly, if I have to do it from a Gnome program, about the only
program where looking in a tar file is visibly useful is Nautilus.
Ironically, clicking on a tar file in Nautilus doesn't work, despite
having a dependency on gnome-vfs2. :/
Secondly, no, Gnome and MC don't support entering a container file,
letting you make changes in it, and remembering those changes to
_lazily_ regenerate the container file when you need it linearized,
possibly months later or never, by some unrelated program.
Thirdly, you must be referring to the Gnome versions of Bash, Make,
GCC, coreutils and Perl which I haven't found.  Perhaps we have a
different idea of what "supports this" means :)
uservfs, which is based on gnome-vfs and getting a bit rusty due to
disuse, does try to solve the last problem.  Unfortunately it needs
further work to have a nicer interface, and the second problem is
still not solved by gnome-vfs.
