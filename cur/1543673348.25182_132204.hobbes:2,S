Hi,
	My root disc is a Quantum Atlas 10k driver attached to an
Adaptec 29160N SCSI controller.  I haven't been able to boot a 2.5
kernel on this machine since around 2.5.48.
The errors vary; as of this morning (2003.05.13) (2.5.69 BK) I see:
Data overrun detected in Data-in phase, Tag=0x2
Have seen Data Phase,  Length = 36, NumSGs = 1.
repeated a whole swag of times, then the kernel gives up on trying to
mount the root partition.
I'm rebuilding now with the old Adaptec driver, and will send another
email as to whether it works.
