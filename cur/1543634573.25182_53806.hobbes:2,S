Not only accidental untar, but buggy progs as well. Recently, I found out
that named had created tens of thousands of (luckily zero-length) files in a
single dir on ext2. While it only took couple of hours to delete them with
"find . -name '...'| xargs -n 5000 rm" commands, I can imagine remote DOS
attacks through daemons that create local temp files. Accessing such
directory quickly becomes slow as molasses on ext2.
Daniels patch seems great. I also recall someone (Ted T'so? Stephen Tweedie?)
had another dir access speed-up patch for ext3... Is that applicable to ext2
or was it already merged?
