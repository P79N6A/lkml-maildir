The file LRU probably *should* run faster than the memory LRU most
of the time, since we stream the readahead data for many sequentially
accessed files through the file LRU.
We adjust the rates at which the two LRUs are scanned depending on
the fraction of referenced pages found when scanning each list.
Look at vmscan.c:get_scan_ratio() for the magic.

Making it smaller would probably result in something that does
not work right.
