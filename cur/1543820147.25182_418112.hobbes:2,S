Subject: [PATCH 2.6.17-rc2] ohci1394, sbp2: fix "scsi_add_device failed" with PL-3507 based devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/23/40

Re-enable posted writes for status FIFO.
Besides bringing back a very minor bandwidth tweak from Linux 2.6.15.x
and older, this also fixes an interoperability regression since 2.6.16:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6356
(sbp2: scsi_add_device failed. IEEE1394 HD is not working anymore.)
Signed-off-by: Stefan Richter <stefanr@s5r6.in-berlin.de>
---
The ugly hardwired PhyUpperBound which this patch (re-)introduces into
sbp2 will be eliminated by a subsequent patchset (which has already been
sent to linux1394-devel).
