So what do you do if your mythical file system supports bad block relocation
but doesn't support something else you need, like journaling or quotas or
whatever?
Nobody's mentioned the most obvious reason why it doesn't belong in the
filesystem, but needs to be in something like the 'md' layer like (I think)
John Bradford suggested:
No amount of code wanking in the filesystem is going to save you if you hit
an error on your swap partition - but an 'md'-like driver might be able to
save you.
