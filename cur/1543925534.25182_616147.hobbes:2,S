Perhaps, but unfortunately a lot of them are related and required for a
compilable patch.  I can probably split it up 4 ways if you really want me
to, in order:
 (1) Move STACK_TOP[_MAX].
 (2) Rename dump_thread() -> aout_dump_thread().
 (3) Everything else.
 (4) Remove obsolete a.out.h inclusions.
I don't think it's really worth splitting (2) from (3) though.

Yes, but that patch isn't there now, and won't be there in the next version -
assuming this arch has a hope of getting in on that one - according to your
statement.
