   But you can't or them together without some icky macro, unless they're
   typedef to an integer type in which case gcc doesn't warn you if you
   just stuck a "sizeof(x)" in there.
Maybe if you make it unsigned char or something.
If there aren't too many spots which need to "or" stuff,
all the "icky macro" stuff could be contained to gfp.h
