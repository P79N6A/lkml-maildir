Yeah, Ivan objected to this, but incorrectly I think.
Ivan, your concern is about disabling things like interrupt controllers 
and power management chips during probe right?  You're right that doing 
that could cause problems if we get and interrupt or PMU event at just 
the wrong time, but that could just as easily happen if decode was 
still enabled but the BAR had a bogus address programmed (as it would 
during probing).
Ultimately, I don't care much one way or another as long as we can get 
the desktop platforms fixed somehow.  I think disabling decode is the 
most correct way of doing this, but I'm open to other solutions (this 
is the only patch I've seen though that's been tested to solve the 
problem).
