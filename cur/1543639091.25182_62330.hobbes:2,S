Hi all.
I have a laptop with a SiS630 chipset. Its VGA stoles memory from main RAM
to act as video RAM (that damned shared ram invention...). It is an AGP
vga, and agpgart always report AGP aperture as 64Mb, independently of how
much memory I have assigned for VGA in the bios. I always undestood that
aperture should be about 2x the card memory (even still I have not clear
what is aperture for...any pointer ?).
How can I tell agpgart that I only want, say, 8Mb for agp aperture ?
TIA
