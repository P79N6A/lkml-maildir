Cause my soundcard to fail to init.
If using "modprobe sound", sb.o initializes the soundcard, reserves the
resources, then loops looking for a second soundcard (check_region(
0x220, 16 ) returns -EBUSY as expected - the soundcard has already been
found), and fails miserably, not freeing resources.
modprobe then attempts to unwind the other modules, sb_lib, uart401,
sound, and soundcore. the last one fails with a refcount of 2 and
nothing using it.
additionally, it trashes the kernel's notion of /proc/interrupts and
/proc/ioports - cat on either of them drops core.
The soundcard in question is a very very old soundblaster awe32, it is
not plug and play yet it has no jumpers! It identifies with a DSP
version 4.13
Somewhere else in the patch, while searching for the text in question, I
noted a comment in Documentation/sound/SoundBlaster
===
-multiple=1     Set to enable detection of multiple Soundblaster cards.
+multiple=0     Set to disable detection of multiple Soundblaster cards.
+               Consider it a bug if this option is needed, and send in
a
+               report.

Here's your report. :)
I've noted one or two other posts to the list with the same / similar
trouble.
If anyone wants more or less details, pls let me know.
