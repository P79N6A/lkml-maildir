I talked to Don about this at the Expo. Don's theory is that its the SMbus
management stuff (the onboard eepro and firmwar eof their own accord
support stuff like 'machine tampered with' and 'reboot' packets). Intel
apparently havent provided enough documentation to handle this right now.
Try turning off BIOS APM and stuff see if that helps.

Ok. The Ipv6 may be cause or a symptom Im not sure which.
