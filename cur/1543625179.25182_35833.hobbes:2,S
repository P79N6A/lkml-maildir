I have a dual AMD board that has the 8738 onboard.  I compile 2.4.18 and
pass it the '6 speaker' selection which should push the Rear speaker
signal out the Line In connector and the Center Speaker Out/ Sub-woofer
signal out the Mic In connector.  This does not happen.  I've tried this
as a module and passing the params on the command line as well as
compiling it directly into the kernel.  Am I missing something (very
likely) or is this a known situation that I just have to deal with?
