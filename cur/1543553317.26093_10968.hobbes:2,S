It dies at the following line in kernel/sched.c:schedule() 
move_rr_back:
	switch (prev->state & ~TASK_EXCLUSIVE) {
		case TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE:
			if (signal_pending(prev)) {
				prev->state = TASK_RUNNING;
				break;
			}
		default:
here==>			del_from_runqueue(prev);
		case TASK_RUNNING:
	}
"prev" contains a run_list structure and prev->run_list.next pointed
to NULL.  This caused the bus-error in __list_del().
# actually the CPU accesses address 0x4 (4 is offset to prev within
# run_list).
BTW, why this switch statement has less breaks at everywhere.
