As Andi is suggesting, I think this may depends on how the BIOS implements
the low-power state. I have tried the same command on my dual Opteron 250
2.4GHz and I get:
$ pfmon --us-c -ecpu_clk_unhalted,interrupts_masked_cycles -k --system-wide -t 10
<session to end in 10 seconds>
CPU0                     9,520,303 CPU_CLK_UNHALTED
CPU0                     3,726,315 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES
CPU1                    21,268,151 CPU_CLK_UNHALTED
CPU1                    14,515,389 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES
That's without idle=poll.
