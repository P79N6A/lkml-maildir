The cwd is not the problem. The '.' is.
The reason for that check is that allowing "rmdir(".")" confuses a lot of
UNIX programs, because it wasn't traditionally allowed.

That's definitely wrong. You can do 
	rmdir `pwd`
and that's fine (not all filesystems will let you do that, but that's a
low-level filesystem issue). It's really only the special names "." and
".." that cannot be removed.
