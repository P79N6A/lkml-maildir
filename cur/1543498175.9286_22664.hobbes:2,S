One man's policy is another man's consistency...

Persistence: that's currently pushed to user space, which is
consistent with one particular ideology.
Chooks and eggs: this is not a problem. Module autoloading works quite
well. All that is required is that /etc/modules.conf is correctly
configured, and attempts to access non-existent device nodes will
automagically cause the driver to be loaded and the nodes suddenly
appear. And before anyone complains about having to configure
/etc/modules.conf, I'll point out that you have to do that anyway to
get module autoloading to work.
