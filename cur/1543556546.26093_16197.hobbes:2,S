Hi,
The check for BKL in d_move() and switch_names() seem to be unnecessary as
d_move() takes dcache_lock and switch_names() is only called by
d_move(). So, if the callers take BKL just for the sake of d_move() they
do not need to, but if, for other reasons, then that is fine. In any case,
the checks in both functions can be removed, imho. Opinions?
Regards.
Tigran
