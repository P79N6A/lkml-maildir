You just broke the userland ABI which must not happen.  at all.  That's
why userland having older headers is fine.

That's why we want the glibc-kernheader package.  Or even better
a package of headers that can be used by the kernel and userland,
but this would require people to properly sort out kernel header
functionality like internal structures and prototypes/inlines from
the actual ABI-relevant contents.  The networking headers currently
are very bad on this.
