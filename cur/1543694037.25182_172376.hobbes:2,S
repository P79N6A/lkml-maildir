Yup, and I disable it on all drives at boot time at the latest.
Is there a status document that lists
- what SCSI drivers support write barriers
  (I'm interested in sym53c8xx_2 if that matters)
- what IDE drivers support write barriers
  (VIA for AMD and Intel for PII/PIII/P4 chip sets here)
- what file systems know how to utilize write barriers (other than
  reiserfs ;-) - what does "dummy ext3 patch" mean?
