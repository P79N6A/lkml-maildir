I suspect this new system is designed for the needs of lower-volume patch
submitters like myself.  For example, I had to submit my latest patch (a binary
compatibility fix) to Linus about 8 times (without ever getting a response I
might add) before it showed up in the latest kernel.  Very inefficient.
Furthermore, I had to make a couple of changes to the patch -- first a logic
error then a spelling error.  Each required a new patch cluttering poor Linus'
Inbox.  With a system in place where I could have updated a numbered patch, and
had immediate feedback on its status, life would have simpler for me, and Linus
would not have had his mailbox so cluttered....
