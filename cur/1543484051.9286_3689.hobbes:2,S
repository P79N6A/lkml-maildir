Why should RMS care about Linux anyway, it's not GNU.
I just checked that article, it's not about changing the license of
existing libraries, something that the license prevents anyway, but about
using the GPL by default for new libraries instead of the LGPL.
If you try to actually read what's written instead of reacting on what you
think it says, there's a larger chance you'll be taken seriously.
