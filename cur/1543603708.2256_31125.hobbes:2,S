   I verified the number of objects per slab is the same in both cases.
   This patch may not improve the performance of your CPU by a great amount,
   but when there is a faster way to do things, why live with the slower one.
Since this code only occurs during SLAB creation, you estimation on
CPU savings is correct.
Why live with it?  Less changes to verify would be one reason :-)
Franks a lot,
