Subject: [PATCH] OMAP1510 serial fix for 115200 baud.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/9/345

The patch below is necessary for 115200 baud on an OMAP1510 internal
UART. It's been in the linux-omap tree for some time and with it applied
to a vanilla Linus git tree the serial console on the Amstrad Delta
(which is OMAP1510 based and whose initial bootloader runs at 115200)
works fine (it doesn't without it). Is there any possibility of getting
it accepted into mainline? It shouldn't affect any other platform due to
the ifdef/cpu_is guards.
