I've already taken that out.
In fact, I've decided to wait until I get the 2.6 done first, then go 
back
and properly update for 2.4.  This was just a patch that has been around
for a while, I just wanted to get it off of my plate so I could do a 
minor
update later, but I'll just wait.
Apologies for the wasted bandwidth.
Thanks.
