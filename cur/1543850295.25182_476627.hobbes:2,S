We have daemons running in the background that can definitely do stuff
after a sync. hmm - one does try_to_freeze() after a wakeup, the
other does:
                if (unlikely(freezing(current))) {
                        set_bit(XBT_FORCE_SLEEP, &target->bt_flags);
                        refrigerator();
                } else {
                        clear_bit(XBT_FORCE_SLEEP, &target->bt_flags);
                }
before it goes to sleep. So that one (xfsbufd - metadata buffer flushing)
can definitely wake up after the sync and do work, and the other could if
the kernel thread freeze occurs after the sync.
Another good question at this point - exactly how should we be putting
these thread to to sleep? Are both these valid methods for freezing them?
And should we be freezing when we wake up instead of before we go to
sleep? i.e. what are teh rules we are supposed to be following?
Cheers,
Dave.
