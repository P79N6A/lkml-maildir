Hello,
Yesterday I faced a very weird problem, and I don't know what to guess.
Please help me out.
My department's switch was down, which disconnected my systems from the
network (and, thus, from the Internet, DNS server, and so on). In this
situation, I couldn't compile the kernel !!! If I did a 'make bzlilo', it
would get stuck in the first compilation (main.c). Why is that ??
Once the network came back up, I could compile the kernel as usual,
without having to change anything in the Linux system.
Linux Distro:	Red Hat 5.2
Kernel:		2.2.10
Thanks in advance for any answer.
Regards,
Ivan
