Hmm, that certainly is different than the old /dev/... interface.  Could
be nice.

Unacceptably bad.  I currently use anywhere from 2 to 4 different
devices with GPIOs.

Too messy.

That I think is perfectly easy to work with, as long as I can somehow
find which device (usually on PCI bus in my case) goes to which
directory.  I suspect that would be the case.

That sounds nice and convinient.

I only consider the change of state on output pins, or reading state of
input pins to be a requirement for port-wide.  Changing between
input/output, and enable and tristate and such, I have no problem with
doing bit by bit, since that is setup stuff.

Well I haven't seen a gpio driver that did port wide yet.  I treat the
ppdev as 8 gpio pins, so at least for that I get port wide.

Sounds lovely to me.

I look forward to seeing it.

Keeping the legacy for at least a while is probably a requirement since
people are already using those interfaces on that hardware.

Well tying into interrupt handlers would be tricky I suspect.  On the
other hand someone might have a use for the feature.  I just mentioned
them because it is a feature of some of the devices I use, although I
don't use them for anything other than input/output myself.
