Fair enough

Left behind with the exception of two that the spec calls obsolete
(end of table 65 & 66 in the v7 spec I have here)

ata.h doesn't have a numeric order though, so i just grouped things
semi-logically for now

now ATA_CMD_DEVICE_RESET
note, the following three patches use the names from the spec
verbatim, which makes them a bit long and ugly but not terribly so...
i'm not bothered by them personally and they are not used in that many
places so IMO they should be acceptable as-is ... yes, i know it makes
the formatting of ata.h look funny, but that was bogus anyhow :)
