Other than the usual PIO mode IDE suspects I've had no problems going up
to 460800bps with a decent UART (ie one with a fifo). At 920Kbit/sec you
begin to overrun the flip buffers if you run with the usual 100Mhz timer
tick.
2.4 is a bit worse nowdays because of the ksoftirqd stuff but you could
easily disable that if you think it is triggering.
