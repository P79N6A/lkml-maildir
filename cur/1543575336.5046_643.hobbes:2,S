Maybe that's the case. The culprits are mostly IDE interfaces. Andre ?
drivers/ide/cmd64x.c:   (void) pci_write_config_byte(dev,PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE, 0x10);
drivers/ide/cs5530.c:   pci_write_config_byte(cs5530_0,PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE, 0x04);
drivers/ide/hpt366.c:   pci_write_config_byte(dev,PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE, 0x08);
drivers/ide/ns87415.c:  (void) pci_write_config_byte(dev,PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE, 0x10);
drivers/atm/eni.c:      pci_write_config_byte(eni_dev->pci_dev,PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE, 0x10);
drivers/media/video/planb.c:    pci_write_config_byte (pdev,PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE, 0x8);

From the BIOS. They are the USB controllers, I couldn't see any writes
to the PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE in the drivers.
