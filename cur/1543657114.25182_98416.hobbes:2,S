initrd on 2.5.53 behaves fine here, see:
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/2.5.53/misc/dmesg.
There's probably more than needed in the command line. Build options are at:
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/2.5.53/misc/config.
I have used module-init-tools-0.9.6. Tarball available under:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules/
You are supposed to do a bit of homework:
- provide specific problem reports (Documentation/serial-console.txt should
  be a lifesaver as you seem to have several computers);
- search the mailing-list archive for current issues;
- read the mailing-list FAQ for general issues (see bottom of messages).
Go read Arnaldo's mail, for real this time. It's Christmas/end of year/
deadline/whatever/ for people on l-k too. Ok ?
Thank you for your attention.
