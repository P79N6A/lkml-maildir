Hi every one,
I have one question regarding security libraries, already shipped with Linux Kernel. That is, all PKI, RSA libraries, as provided by OpenSSL are already integrated within the linux kernel source code? OR, one have to use OpenSSL seperately in this regard. 
I can see, linux/crypto.h and linux/hash.h files shipped with 2.6 kernel and know that SHA1 "hashing" can be done using linux/hash.h, but beside that, any possiblity for RSA or PKI.
If yes, any link to their use, will be highly appreciated.
Best,
JG
