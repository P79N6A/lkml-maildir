I think you are ok based on our preliminary review, but the patent lawyers
will go down each claim granted by the USPTO in related patents, and 
analyze them relative to your proposed methods.  Patents are granted for 
specific "methods" or ways of implementing stuff, and to infringe, you 
have to copy the methods described in the claims of the patent and be 
using them in the same basic combinations.  The patent process in the US 
is a lot like filing a lawsuit.  The patent application contains a series 
of "claims" for the invention, just as a petition for relief in a lawsuit 
contains "claims" of issues of fact.
The patent lawyers have this fancy software (that costs a lot of $$$) that
can cross reference your invention with thousands of patents quickly,
and look for similiar "methods".  The three you identified was very 
light -- there's probably going to be a larger number identified by
these guys since patent attorneys have access to patents pending and 
provisional patent applications, which are not available to the 
general public.  There's no telling how many provisional patents might 
be around with something like this.
I would be unconcerned. 95% of getting around patents is just having 
patent lawyers to handle the politics at the USPTO.  Most of the 
patent process in the US is very much a political process as much 
as a legal one.  Think of a patent lawyer as someone in Congress
lobbying for your interests, and you will have kind of the right 
picture of the "patent racket" in the US.  Most patent infringment
lawsuits end up in mediation with the USPTO with one side or the 
other having specific patent claims revoked because one side or 
the other gets their patent lawyers sending letters to the USPTO 
challenging prior art claims.  Novell in their lawsuit with Roger 
Billings over the Network Operating System patents in 1993 convinced
the patent office to invalidate his patents by shear force in 
numbers of legions of patent lawyers and a mountain of research 
and prior art claims -- they could not have gotten out of the 
infringement suit otherwise....
