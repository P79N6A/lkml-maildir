These 'hack' files, functions and CONFIGS should be renamed.
How about
 * selfmod.[c|h] (core infrastructure)
 * CONFIG_SELFMOD  (enables the self modifying API)
 * CONFIG_SELFMOD_IRQ (use it on IRS)
 * CONFIG_SELFMOD_TIMER (user it on the timer)
The last two would be dependent on CONFIG_SELFMOD
With the recent ksplice stuff it seems self-modifying code is ready for
the mainline :)
