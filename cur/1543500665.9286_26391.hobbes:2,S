hm, i cant see any place where we have (!Mapped && Uptodate) in pre4. We
have (!Mapped && !Uptodate), but thats normal.

i reintroduced them simply for the wrong reason (IO errors), but i'm
definitely not arguing about that, it's a bug in my patch. Will resend the
patch with these things fixed (well, preserving the original behavior),
based on pre5. That might as well better show why i think it's not a good
idea to 'code' holes as (!Mapped && Uptodate).
