Slightly off-topic, and probably not your area, but it would probably
help your case if omap were better looked after in mainline.  Most OMAP
platforms build fine, except for one long standing one - the H2 1610
defconfig, which hasn't built since 2.6.17-git11.
So, rather than shoveling new stuff in there, can the maintainence of
the stuff already merged please be improved.
Build results vs kernel version for H2 1610:
