I'm making NOSUID per-mountpoint. So
	pid = clone(CLONE_NEWNS,0);
	if (!pid) {
		...
		remount everything with nosuid
		exec sshd
	}
should be OK
As for hiding the directories - also easy, mount --bind an empty 
immutable directory over each of them.
NODEV is also easy to make per-mountpoint, but readonly may be trickier;
we need permission() to take vfsmount+dentry instead of inode for that.
Doable, but will touch quite a few places.
