You are talking about something different than the current problem.
The current problem is that when crosscompiling we get a different 
_padding_ due to file2alias.c being compiled with HOSTCC.
What you are talking about is a different issue, and I can't talk about 
it since I don't understand these interactions between modpost and depmod.
