The exact wording in RFC1813 is
   NFS3ERR_STALE
       Invalid file handle. The file handle given in the
       arguments was invalid. The file referred to by that file
       handle no longer exists or access to it has been
       revoked.
The problem is with the 'access to it has been revoked'. It says
nothing about whether or not that is permanent, hence you have to be
very careful about applying this concept to the mount point.
In any case, remounting automatically is a very bad idea unless you do
it cleanly (i.e. kill all existing processes, unmount the disk, and
then start afresh). If you just do it transparently and don't clean
out the (d|i)caches, you will see some pretty odd things happening if
filehandles on the new disk don't match the filehandles on the old
disk.
This is BTW the reason why unfsd is badly broken wrt. CDROMS.

See above.
