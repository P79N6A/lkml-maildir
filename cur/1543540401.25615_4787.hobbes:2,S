Requesting MMIO regions protects against all sorts of cases, seen and
unseen.  The core PCI code uses the resource system to allocate an
address space for new hotplugged device.  Drivers mainly use the system
to protect against each other -- for more generic hardware, two drivers
might exist for the same hardware.  The resource system prevents the
second driver from acquiring PCI MMIO resources registered by the first
driver.  Or, there might be a driver bug which caused it to calculate an
incorrect base address.  The resource system would prevent such a buggy
driver from obtaining resources already reserved to another.
