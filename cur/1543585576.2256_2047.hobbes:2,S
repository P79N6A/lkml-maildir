Hi,
When I mount a storage device using the command as follow
mount -t msdos /dev/xxx /mnt/xxx -o blocksize=1024
This command will cause error on kernel linux2.4.2
When I remove the option , " -o blocksize=1024", it's OK.
But on the kernel version 2.2.17, with the option blocksize=1024, it works.
Doesn't the new kernel version 2.4.2 support big blocksize ??
