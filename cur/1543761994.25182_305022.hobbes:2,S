Ok, just so I know where we stand: your gameport/joystick does work in
plain 2.6.11 but does not in 2.6.11-mm4, correct? When you load the
module with "joystick_port=1" is there any messages from ens1371 in
dmesg? Have you tried specifying exact port, like
"joystick_port=0x200" or "joystick_port=0x218"? Do you see these ports
reserved in /proc/ioports? What about /sys/bus/gameport/devices/? Do
you see anything in that directory?
