I have already implemented this once and submitted a patch.
Search in the paper for this paragraph:
http://jonsmirl.googlepages.com/graphics.html
DRM also implements the concept of a master user with more
capabilities than normal users. These extra capabilities allow the
graphics device to be initialized and the consumption of GPU resources
to be controlled. The current X server, which runs as root, functions
as the DRM master. There is actually no real requirement that the DRM
master be run as root, and there is a preliminary patch that removes
this requirement.
That paragraphs contains a link to the code that used to be hosted at
freedesktop.org. Maybe they can still find it.
