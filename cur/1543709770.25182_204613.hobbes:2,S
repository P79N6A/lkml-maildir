Looks like you're going to need to get a little deeper to keep it from 
being OT on this list.
What is the driver designs of say, solaris, OS/2, Win32 (NT & 9x trees) 
and how are they good and how are they bad?
What specific (think API changes, nothing generalized here *at all*) 
changes could benefit linux, and why and how?  Nobody will listen to 
hand waving, so you need a tight case for each change.
HTH,
Mike
