We use reiserfs3 to store data and have had very good luck in getting 
data off of real world, hard disk failures.  In our case, we have a 
digital signature which is used to compare validate the content of the 
files after recovery so we have an extra comfort level with the results 
of a repaired file system...
Working on getting fsck to run reliably and quickly on large file 
systems (any type of file system) is certainly a big item on our wish 
list.  With relatively small file system (320GB) we can spend hours 
trying to recover.

We have been sponsors of this work at Wisconsin - a good group with 
interesting results.
As an earlier thread on lkml showed this summer, we still have a long 
way to go to getting consistent error semantics in face of media 
failures between the various file systems.  I am not sure that we even 
have consensus on what that default behavior should be between 
developers, so image how difficult life is for application writers who 
want to try to ride through or write automated "HA" recovery scripts for 
systems with large numbers of occasionally flaky IO devices ;-)
