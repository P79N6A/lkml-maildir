I would rather disagree. Subjective. Unit is a generic word, just like
subsystem. Unit-tests for example is a widespread word it refer to
internal units of a big system.

It is .c + .h.
Why definitely, where is the definition? I appreciate your opinion, but
do not want any endless discussion about "how the life has to go",
though.

Where does this rather restrictive model come from? What does it mean in
practice for UBI? Please, be more specific.

Please, refine what does this exactly mean. I do not see how I should
have sent it, sorry. OK, I've separated external headers, JFFS2 support,
build stuff. What next?
And I sent it just for review, as you requested, I assumed that for the
pull we have git, and I specified the URL.
Thanks,
Artem.
