Hi Michael,
> ... send to Linus only. (You don't want a 150kB bzip2 compressed firmware blob, don't you? In case you do, drop me a line.)
the request_firmware() framework is part of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 and so for
most drivers the firmware file can be loaded from userspace through proc
or sysfs. Please take a look at it.
Regards
Marcel
