In that case, don't forget to upgrade atop.
That's a version of top that uses BSD process
accounting to grab the transient processes
that wouldn't be seen in /proc before they die.

It's by 8 bits, with a stable 11-bit fraction
instead of a 10-bit to 12-bit variable-size one.
old: 1xxxxxxxxxxyy000000000000000000000
new: 1xxxxxxxxxxx000000000000000000000000000000
That's a 42-bit number instead of a 36-bit one.
The old base-8 exponent is wasteful, plus the old
format stores the leading 1 instead of using an
implied 1 and special exponent for leading 0.

a. just what I said
b. 32-bit IEEE float (easy enough to encode by hand)
c. raw data -- is the space saving all that critical?
d. raw data with gzip-style compression
(note that gzip's deflate algorithm is in the kernel)

I doubt it. I think the C standard has something to
say about this. In any case, I just checked a mix of
big-endian and little-endian boxes:
32-bit BE SPARC
64-bit BE SPARC
32-bit BE PowerPC
32-bit LE i386
64-bit LE x86-64
64-bit LE Alpha
In every case, 1-byte padding came after ac_flag.
I'm pretty sure ac_comm is too big as well. It has
room for 17 bytes. It needs room for 15, plus a '\0'
if you want one.
