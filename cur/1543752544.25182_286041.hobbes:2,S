I thought about this and was not 100% sure. I'll explain how I see it
before I go redo large portions of the patch.
1. Discriminating kernel/user will leave the kernel area fragmented much
worse than my approach. On my systems I tested, I found that a significant
portion of kernel memory was taken up by slabs like buffer_head,
ext3_inode_cache, ntfs_inode_cache, ntfs_big_inode_cache and
radix_tree_node. I did not want to mix these allocations, which
potentially are easy to get rid of, with allocations that are incredibly
difficult.  (Totally aside, I also found that slab caches suffer from
terrible internal fragmentation, sometimes wasting up to 60% of their
memory but thats a separate problem)
2. Address-ordering biases was also something I looked at early on, but
then figured it didn't matter. If I don't reserve a 2^MAX_ORDER blocks,
the system will just get terribly fragmented under memory presure when
they meet in the middle. If I do reserve, I just end up with a similar
layout to what I have now.
