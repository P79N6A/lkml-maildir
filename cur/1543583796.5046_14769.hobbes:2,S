	HI. I'm not sure I'm supposed to ask newbie questions here, if so,
I'm sorry. But here goes:
	I'm trying to do a driver for a kind of modem that doesn't use
serial ports, but parralel. So I thought it would be enough to simulate a
ttyS* device. But I need to read from a file the parameters for the modem.
I tried using asm/unistd.h, but when I call open(), I get "Bad adress" as
an error. What I would like to know is can syscalls (eg open()/close()/
lseek()/...) be used in a module, and if so, how ?
Thanx for reading.
Bogdan.
