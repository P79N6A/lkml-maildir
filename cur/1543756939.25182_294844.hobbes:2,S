No.  You also need to consider situations such as out-of-tree drivers 
for the same hardware (might not use PCI API), and situations where you 
have peer devices discovered and used (PCI API doesn't have "hey, <this> 
device is associated with <current driver>, too" capability)

I'm glad you asked ;-)  As the author of pci_disable_device() and 
pci_request_regions(), I recognized their inadequacy almost immediately.
There are some fundamental flaws in the API that need correcting:
* pci_disable_device() should perform exactly the opposite of 
pci_enable_device(), no more, no less.   It should NOT unconditionally 
disable the device, but instead restore the hardware to the state it was 
in prior to pci_enable_device().
* pci_request_regions() should be axiomatic.  By that I mean, 
pci_enable_device() should
	(a) handle pci_request_regions() completely
	(b) fail if regions are not available
* pci_enable_device() may touch the hardware when it should not.  In an 
ideal world, pci_enable_device() would
	* assign resources to device, if necessary
	* request_resource()s [aka pci_request_regions()]
	* enable device by setting bits in PCI_COMMAND, etc.
but since the request-resource step is assumed to occur after 
pci_enable_device() returns to the driver, this is impossible.
The solution?  I am still thinking.  My gut feeling is that we want a 
slightly higher level PCI API for drivers.  Drivers pass in an 'info' 
structure to pci_up().  pci_up() enables the device, requests resources 
(not just irq), maps resources as necessary, enables irqs and/or MSI as 
necessary, and similar housekeeping.  pci_down() does the precise 
opposite. Essentially, pci_up() is a lib function that kills a ton of 
duplicate code from the vast majority of PCI drivers.
OTOH, Alan's suggestion seems sane and a lot more simple, but doesn't 
address the flaws in the API.
