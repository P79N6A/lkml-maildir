Hi,
I'm sure many of you have experience with lots of different of spam 
filters, at least some of you will know how good and effective DSPAM is.
What I propose is simple, after we teach DSPAM what is ham and what is 
spam (a quick process on LKML) have one person who will volunteer
to weed out any false positives (if any) for a short period of time, 
following that we can just let DSPAM do its magic and enjoy a totally 
spam free
LKML.  
The chance of false positives with the kind of highly specific topics 
and keywords discussed on LKML is extremely small.
Comments?
Marc
