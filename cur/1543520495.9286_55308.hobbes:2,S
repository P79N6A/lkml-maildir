A friend is getting 'neighbour table overflow' mostly all
the time when working with the network card.
He also says that is take very long time to start all the
programs after the kernel has booted up. The errors apper
in a random order.
He has a dual p2 266 with Intel motherboard with builtin
intel express pro 100 and one intel express pro 100 PCI.
He has tried with module driver and with builtin.
He has also tried with diffrent DIMMs.
He has also tried to shutdown all program and modules that
wasn't needed.
The distribution is Debian potato from the begining of
november.
Thankfull of any help what so ever!
