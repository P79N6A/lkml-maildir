Hello Oleg,
there was a question about fsck'ing the ext3 filesystems. Since it crashed
today I did check them now and no errors or warnings showed up. Everything
seems clean. I don't exactly understand what that tells you. I guess you mean
the fs metadata may have been hit, too. Seems not.
Regards,
Stephan
