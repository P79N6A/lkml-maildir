Assuming you used MS_SYNC for the msync() flags.  MS_ASYNC could still be 
proceeding to flush the pages out in the background.  And the kernel may 
have triggered writeback of the second half -- it is free to do so as it 
sees fit.

All local clients will see the mmap() being updated from the time it is 
dirtied, but there is no ordering of write()s with respect to the mmap 
unless you explicitely msync(..MS_SYNC..) as in your example.
