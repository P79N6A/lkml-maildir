   You're making the flaw of assuming that there's a 1-1 mapping between
   ``power users'' and a preference for the command line.
   Once you get away from traditional Unix, that isn't the case (and
   it's only the case on Unix because traditional Unix has such klunky
   GUI's that it drives away everybody except the ``power users'' who
   are willing to use a command line.)
   Features that only exist inside a GUI (like the MacOS undelete) or
   inside (shudder) libc hacks tend to turn around and bite people who
   don't follow the One True Way of doing things.
