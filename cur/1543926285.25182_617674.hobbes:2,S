I'm not actively working on it but AFAIK I may have been
the last one to touch it when I did the mips version back
at Timesys.  Although I was able to get a functional port
of the work there were gremlins I never had sufficient
time to address.  That is a relatively minor issue.
The more daunting problem stems from limitations in the MIPS
ABI which makes the latency trace support problematic.
Rather than rehash the issue:

Until we have a usable instrumentation solution in place,
characterization, debug, and support of PREEMPT_RT for MIPS
is going to be a challenge.
