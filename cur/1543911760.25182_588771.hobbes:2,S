On Friday I had rebooted the box (remotely) after adding "noapic" to the
boot options and the machine didn't come back up - came in this morning
to see a kernel panic after the reboot to do with nmi_watchdog.
This morning I've removed the "noapic" option and instead set
"nmi_watchdog=0" and its booted and been up and running for 30 minutes
with no APCI whereas these happened every thing previously during boot.
So nmi_watch does indeed seem to related to the root cause of the
problem. 
Thanks for the help Alistair! One other point you may be able to help
with - this is the first time I've used a dual core processor and I
expected that /proc/interrupts would should interrupts distributed
between both cores whereas they actually seem to be mainly handled by
the 1st core:

Is this to be expected for dual core systems?

Yeah, I thought as much. After disabling NMI Watchdog I didn't see these
NCQ messages initially but after running a few bonnie runs to load the
disks I'm now getting them again.

Yeah that seems the case - last Friday these errors seemed to be
occurring every 1-2 hours or so even when I wasn't using the machine.
I'm currently rebuilding the kernel with the following patch to disable
NCQ for these drives:
