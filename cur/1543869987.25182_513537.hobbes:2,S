I played with this a little, and got puzzled.
My quad core box used exactly the same amount of power whether the
'ladder' governer was loaded & in use or not.  In both situations
it was exactly the same as a vanilla 2.6.20
I'd have expected it to use more until I loaded up 'ladder' to bring it
on par featurewise with 2.6.20.  What did I miss?
