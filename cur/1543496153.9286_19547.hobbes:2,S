Hello,
maybe the problem running RTC in non-UTC time is known to you, 
including its implications. Basically the kernel lacks two things 
when booting:
1) time zone
2) Whether RTC runs UTC or local time
My solution would be:
1) Add a kernel parameter like RTC=UTC|local
2) Add a kernel parameter like TZ=+0200 (numeric notation ised in 
EMail)
3) Enhance routines that set the system time to update the RTC as well
I some people can convince me that it's a good idea, I might develop 
a patch...
Regards,
Ulrich
