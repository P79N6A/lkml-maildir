yes, that's what I tried, but it had no effect. For instance, I declared
                safe_for_read(GPCMD_READ_FORMAT_CAPACITIES),
which is 0x23, but growisofs still complains with
Aug 18 13:52:21 aiken kernel: THIS IS MY NEW PATCH SCSI-CMD Filter: 0x23 not allowed with read-mode
That's what I don't understand. I think the line above should declare
0x23 as safe for read, but it seems to be ignored.

Likely I will end up with this :-/

I will check that!
