Not sure if we are not too close to stable release to do that? And I
see no incremental way how to get there. Moving compatibility stuff
closer to drivers can be done close to stable release...
OTOH it forces pain where it belongs, and when someone invents stupid
ioctl, it puts pain on him... I like that.
