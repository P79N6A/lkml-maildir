This most likely means something besides the aic7xxx is making that
interrupt but as sson as the aic7xxx is loaded and that interrupt is
enabled then the other device (whatever it may be, check the output of
lspci to see if anything else is sharing that interrupt) is likely making
all those interrupts and that's what needs fixed.
