A fio output taken from the raid1 cfq (2.6.28.1-patch 1) run looks like
the following. It's a bit strange that we have readers started earlier
which seems to complete only _after_ more recent readers have.

Given the numbers I get, I see that runt-max numbers does not appear to
be so high at each job file run, which makes it difficult to compare
them (since you never know if you've hit the worse-case yet). This could
be related to raid1, because I've seen this both with and without your
patch applied, and it only seems to appear on raid1 executions.
However, the patch you sent does not seem to improve the behavior. It
actually makes the average and max latency worse in almost every case.
Changing the queue, slice_async_rq and quantum parameters clearly helps
reducing both avg and max latency.
