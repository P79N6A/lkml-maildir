Nope. And I don't even see a relationship between preemption and asap I/O
schedulding. What make you think that I/O threads won't be preempted by

I have not seen a single well structured benchmark that shows a significant
difference. I've seen lots of benchmarks with odd mixes of different patches
showing something unknown. How about a simple clear dbench?
