I thought You proposed to utilize ip route in the following way:
"ip route xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx via xxx dev xxx src MY_VIRTUAL_IP_ADDRESS"
This approach does not work with the setups we have in mind. So I misunderstood 
You. As we pointed out in the other part of the mail iptables NAT is not an option 
for the relevant customers.
