Hi Andrew,
Thanks for your comments. There are some clarifications below (I'm OK
with the rest of your comments).

I can't figure out how to do it in a readable way and dependent on
BITS_PER_LONG.

OK, I changed the comments and remove the encounters (which might be a
wrong interpretation of this word).

It won't have any effect. The pid is just an additional information
displayed when reporting an unreferenced object.

Yes, it needs a better comment (the terminology is known in the garbage

It might be even better to use ULONG_MAX here.

I agree, the early logging part needs commenting. The above states are
just the callbacks which cannot be handled because memleak_init() wasn't
called yet. Once kmemleak is initialised, it goes through the array and
calls the corresponding memleak_alloc/memleak_free/... functions.

I'll add comments. The members are just arguments passed to the kmemleak
callbacks that need to be stored before kmemleak is fully initialised.
Maybe some other name like early_buffer would be more meaningful.

That's still on the to-do list. The first step I did, as suggested by
others (I think Pekka), was to use the same flags as those used by the
code triggering the callback. This way we don't need to always have
GFP_ATOMIC.
The next step is to change most of the panic/BUG stuff in the code to
something more friendly like disabling kmemleak rather than locking the
machine.

The reader of the min_addr/max_addr variables isn't taking the
object_tree_lock at that point. It does a simple boundary check and, if
this check succeeds, it look-up the object_tree (with
read_lock(object_tree_lock)). My thinking here was that the boundaries
update might not become visible before the the object_tree update. And
adding locking around these boundaries looks too heavyweight, especially
when we have to check a huge amount of values during scanning.
Now, I don't think it really matters whether the boundaries are visible
or not because we could see the boundaries udpated and do the
read_lock(object_tree_lock) before he thread updating the boundaries
gets the chance to do write_lock(object_tree_lock).
There may be another hypothetical situation in which the boundaries will
never become visible to other CPUs unless a memory barrier is used. But
the write_unlock following the min_addr/max_addr update already has such
barriers.
So, I think this barrier can be safely removed.

Not really, we may call the delete_object() function during a scanning
episode when the object->use_count could be higher and put_object()
wouldn't actually free it unless use_count becomes 0.

There is Documentation/kmemleak.txt and it says something about false
positives/negatives but it can be improved.

It didn't.

I'll add a comment. It is rate-limited to avoid calling schedule() after
every pointer checked. It would be really time consuming.

The memleak_scan() function (and the subsequently called scan_block) can
be invoked from either a kernel thread or from a user process when
reading the /sys/kernel/debug/memleak file. The signal_pending() is
intended for the latter case. Scanning takes considerable amount of time
(minutes) and the user might decide to stop this, hence the
scan_should_stop = 1 and the scan_block() function will avoid any
subsequent pointer look-ups.
The kthread_should_stop() is called only outside the memleak_scan()
function. For the kthread, there is currently no way to stop it in the
middle of a scan.
An alternative would be to differentiate the scan_yield() checks
(process or kthread) with an additional argument that gets passed via
memleak_scan(). Or, is there a way to tell whether it's in a kernel
thread or user process context? Checking current->mm?

I'll have to review this but there are several objects referred via the
"struct page" in the mem_map. So it only scans these structures
otherwise there would be plenty of false positives.

I'll look at it. I mainly did what I saw in other parts of the kernel.

Because Ingo asked for it :-). It's mainly for his automatic testing.
I'll add a meaningful comment.
Thanks again for your comments. I'll post another set of patches once I
sort these comments out.
