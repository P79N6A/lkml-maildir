help
My application uses SHARED memory mapping files for file I/O, and we have
observed
that Linux does not flush dirty pages to disk until munmap or msync are
called.
I would like to know are there any development plans which would address
this issue or
if there is a version of bdflush which flushes write required pages (dirty
pages) to disk?
Regards
        Keith Ansell.
