This cannot be. A stock kernel-2.4.18, running a 133 MHz AMD-SC520,
(like a i586) with a 33 MHz bus, handles interrupts off IRQ7 (the lowest
priority), from the 'printer port' at well over 75,000 per second without
skipping a beat or missing an edge. This means that latency is at least
as good as 1/57,000 sec = 0.013 microseconds.
To get data into user-space is not 'interrupt latency'. If that's what
is meant, you could lose a whole (worse case) HZ on a single CPU machine
before any user would even know that data was available or an interrupt
occurred.
