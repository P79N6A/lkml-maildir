I have some questions.  I noticed when I boot, my 2 slots have pre-allocated
IRQs (one time I got both cards on the same irq and every other time, the
top slot is always IRQ5 which is already allocated by the PCI bios to pci
sound card.  my 3c575 doesn't work very well being on IRQ5 when transfering
files)
Since the IRQs are preallocated, inserting an 8-bit or 16-bit card causes
another IRQ to be allocated.  I'm not sure if the cardmgr (pcmcia-cs 3.1.8)
needs to understand how to do this, or the cards should be allocated on the
fly by another program.  cardmgr would assign irq 3 to one of the cards
(irq3 is not used on this box, IRport disabled)
One more question.  Was there a reason for having a seperate (modules here)
pci_socket.o and yenta.o?  ATM, the debian /etc/pcmcia.conf wants a single
module for the controller.  /etc/init.d/pcmcia uses insmod to load it,
obviously, telling it yenta won't allow ds.o to load, using pci_socket won't
load.
Sorry, I haven't been able to try the suggestions you meantioned a few days
ago.
