In some situations well-defined and finite set of "nesting levels" does
not exist. For example, if one has a tree with per-node locking, and
algorithms acquire multiple node locks left-to-right in the tree
order. Reiser4 does this.
Can nested locking restrictions be weakened for certain lock types?
Nikita.
