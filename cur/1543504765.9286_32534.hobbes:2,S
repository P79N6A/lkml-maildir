   If you move the start, OK. Moving the end is allowed as long as you
   make sure you resize the filesystem before actually clobbering it.
If the filesystem is mounted, then you don't want to allow either the
start or the end of the filesystem to move.  If you are playing with the
kernel patches do live-mounted resizes of ext2, then one could imagine a
patch where the partition remounting code asks the filesystem code for
permission about whether it is safe to allow the partition reloadto
proceed.  But since those patches are still in development, a simple "if
the filesystem is in use, then it shouldn't change (or at least not let
it shrink!)" hueristic is probably the safest.
