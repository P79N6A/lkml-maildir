My data is interesting for kbuild/efax type work loads and it looks
like bk export might be different. Thomas Molina tested with the patch
I have occasionally posted to revert some VM changes in 2.6.0-test3: No
apparent change in run time (hard to tell for sure since 2.6 increased
variance considerably for some work loads).
I'm not sure how to classify the bk export. It may be the qsbench type
or something new. If it is the former, then 2.5.39 performs a lot worse
than 2.5.38 (and 2.6.0, for that matter).
It would also be interesting to see the numbers for 2.5.27: That's when
physical scanning was introduced -- IMO that performance should be the
minimal goal for 2.6.
