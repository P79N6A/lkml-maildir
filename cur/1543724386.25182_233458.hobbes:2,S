If only the one file has been written to, an fsync on ext3 shouldn't
produce any more writeout than an fsync on ext2.
If there are other files on the same fs which have been written to then
they will be accidentally fsynced too, unless you're using data=writeback.
Either that, or SQLite is broken.

fsync in ordered data mode will sync file data to the main fs and will sync
metadata tothe journal.  It will not sync previously-journalled metadata
back to the main fs, because that's not required for a succesful recovery.
