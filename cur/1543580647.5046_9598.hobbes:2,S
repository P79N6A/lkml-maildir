Though your describption is right, I don't think the case is very common:
Sometimes in LVM on a pv boundary and maybe sometimes in the scsi code.
In raid1 you need some kind of clone iobuf, which should work with both
cases.  In raid0 you need a complete new pagelist anyway, same for raid5.

Sure you could: you embedd that information in a higher-level structure.
I think you want the whole kio concept only for disk-like IO.  Then many
of the things you do are completly right and I don't see much problems
(besides thinking that some thing may go away - but that's no major point).
With a generic object that is used over subsytem boundaries things are
different.
