Well, I thought this deal was over but apparently not. My 2.5.54 kernel
is still working fine, but when I compiled 2.4.20-ac2, it didn't pick up
my Nforce2 IDE. On a whim I checked include/linux/pci_ids.h and it has a
different PCI ID for PCI_DEVICE_ID_NVIDIA_NFORCE_IDE, namely 0x01bc.
(lspci -v reports 0x0065 here). Perhaps 0x01bc is the nforce1 ide
chipset and 0x0065 is the nforce2 ide chipset?
