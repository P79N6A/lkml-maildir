I have some servers running on tg3+bond with up to 70 Mbps with about one
year of uptime. Ok, they're not on 2.4.32 yet, but that's just to say that
I dont suspect those drivers.

       ^^^^^
interesting, this machine is SMP.
memtest86 only involves CPU0 in tests. I've already had a great difficulty
trying to detect memory problems which occured only when more than one CPU
was accessing the RAM. Can your machine support its load with only one CPU ?
Maybe you observe more I/O than pure CPU. It would be interesting to restart
it with the 'nosmp' boot option.

I'm somewhat surprized, because I've not found a direct nor indirect call
path from alloc_skb() to filemap_sync_pte_range() in which the error is
reported. I'm clearly missing something here.
