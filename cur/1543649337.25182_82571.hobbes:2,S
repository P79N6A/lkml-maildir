I'm beginning to think you're right. You should ask Keith Owens if kdb
etc. can use your API successfully.

Then if you add such code, you can add dev_name ... I hate code that
does nothing ...

I'm trying to reduce code duplication - you do basically the same thing
notifier register/unregister does.
btw, the stuff you add to header files should all be in asm-i386/nmi.h
IMHO.
It would make it clear that there's a fast-path "set nmi handler" and
the slow one, and you can document the difference there, if that's what
we're going to do.
