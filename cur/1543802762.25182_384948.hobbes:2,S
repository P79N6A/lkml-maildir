No, you aren't doing anything wrong.
It appears that the 'kobject_add' call in bind_rdev_to_array is not
setting the ->dentry field for the kobject.
i.e. it is failing to create
   /sys/block/md0/md/dev-XXXX
where 'XXXX' is the internal name for the component device, as
returned by 'bdevname'.  The most likely reason I can think of for
this is that the name is already in use. i.e. different sx devices get
the same name.... let's see....
Close, but not quite.
sx8 creates device names with a '/' in them as we can see from:
> 
> [ 2281.547827] md: bind<sda1>
> [ 2281.547877] md: bind<sx8/0p1>
                             ^
That's unfortunate.  We will have to remove them.
You will find that the names in /sys/block look like
    /sys/block/sx8!0
The following patch should achieve the same substitution for
md.
NeilBrown
--------------------------
Remove slashed from disk names when creation dev names in sysfs
e.g. The sx8 driver uses names like sx8/0.
This would make a md component dev name like
   /sys/block/md0/md/dev-sx8/0
which is no allowed.  So we change the '/' to '!' just like
fs/partitions/check.c(register_disk) does.
