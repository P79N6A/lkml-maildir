sorry, i dont quite follow ... you're saying it does or doesnt make
sense to have NUMA syscalls on a no-mmu platform ?  my [limited]
understanding of NUMA is that it, by definition, requires a MMU in
order to shunt pages around

you're right we want mremap, my fault

lack of man pages on these made be lazy and dump em into the mmu pile
when in reality they have nothing to do with it ... we do want these

useful only with SMP so i guess we should do it
