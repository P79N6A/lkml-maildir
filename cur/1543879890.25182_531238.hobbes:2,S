It wouldn't help much to not have standard generic attributes for the
averaged measurements.
That said, yes, there are relative measurements (percent), and time
measurements (some battery firmware can tell you how much *time* it will
take to stop recharing, empty the battery, etc).

I don't care either way, as long as it is *documented* what is averaged, and
what is instantaneous.
