Oh yes, I've been using the patches for a couple of month on my
private machine.  Herbert Poetzl found and fixed one bug that I only
noticed on power-down (rare event) and was too lazy to care about.
Since then another month has passed and my disk still contains a few
files with useful data here and there. ;)

The 90% solution is a good thing.
