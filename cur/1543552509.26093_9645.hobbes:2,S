That seems best.

No, that would be an unreasonable complaint.  My gripe is
unrelated to gcc - it concerns people who send you patches
and keep everyone else, including the nominal maintainer
in the dark.
I challenge anyone to demonstrate how the evasion of peer
review strengthens Linux.
Anyway, let's run the numbers on gcc:
gcc-2.7.2.3 versus 
gcc-2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2) versus
gcc-20001009 (three-week-old snapshot)
Compilation time (make -j3 bzImage, dual CPU)
gcc-2.7.2.3:  325.02s user 31.98s system 190% cpu 3:07.77 total
gcc-2.91.66:  356.51s user 30.96s system 195% cpu 3:17.71 total
gcc-20001009: 578.99s user 43.51s system 197% cpu 5:15.67 total
Memory footprint:
     text    data     bss     dec     hex filename                    (Normalised)
gcc-2.7.2.3:
  1383419  228621  247624 1859664  1c6050 vmlinux.2.7.2.3                   1.00
gcc-2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2)
  1463242  239353  250004 1952599  1dcb57 vmlinux-2.91.66                   1.05
gcc-20001009
  1499994  244153  245620 1989767  1e5c87 vmlinux-20001009                  1.07
A lot of this is due to more aggressive alignment in the two
newer compilers, so we add
	-malign-loops=0 -malign-functions=0 -malign-jumps=0
and get:
gcc-2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2) (-malign)
  1429267  239353  250004 1918624  1d46a0 vmlinux-2.91.66-maligns           1.03
gcc-20001009 (-malign)
  1422275  244153  245620 1912048  1d2cf0 vmlinux-20001009-maligns          1.03
but we note that the two more recent compilers still do
a `.align 32' in front of `.rodata/.string'.  This is not
configurable on the gcc command line (it should be).  Thank
heavens for the GPL:
  1367864  238713  250004 1856581  1c5445 vmlinux-2.91.66-maligns-string    0.998
And replacing `-O2' with `-Os':
  1358473  238713  250004 1847190  1c2f96 vmlinux                           0.993
       
         
Summary?  With `-malign-loops=0 -malign-functions=0 -malign-jumps=0 -Os'
and a little patch, egcs-1.1.2 actually generates shorter code than
2.7.2.3 and is not a significantly slower compiler.
