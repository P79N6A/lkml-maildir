Wouldn't it be better to preserve in the source code history the
brelse->put_bh conversion?  We can pour a huge number of changes in
ext4 before we submit, but I would have thought it would be easier for
everyone to see what is going on if we submit with just the minimal
changes, and then have patches that address concerns like this one at
a time.
