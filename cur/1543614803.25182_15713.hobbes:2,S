It's even doable within the .c file (and preferable for small drivers).  
Something like:
	/* mydriver.c .... header blah blah */
	config_requires(CONFIG_INET);
	config_option(CONFIG_MY_FAST_CHIP, "Help info for this");
which gets picked out of the .c files during depend phase, and nullified 
during compile by means of -Iconfig_system.h would even let us get rid of 
Makefiles for drivers.  Wouldn't being able to just drop a .c file (or a 
bunch of .c files) into the tree in the right place be great?  Eliminating 
makefiles means eliminating more conflicts, which might mean more time to 
respond to other issues...
