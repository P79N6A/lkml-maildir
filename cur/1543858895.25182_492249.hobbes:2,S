Ok. How about child_reaper() for now? "p->pid == 1" doesn't look good either.

In that case we should use something else than for_each_process() to filter
out task from different namespaces, no?

I must admit, I don't understand what is the purpose of pid namespace.
The current implementation looks incomplete. For example, mk_pid()
takes pid_namespace into account, but find_pid() (and thus attach_pid())
does not. Shouldn't pid_hash[] live in the "struct pid_namespace" ?
