Subject: Areca RAID driver remaining items?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This appears to be the most current version of the driver:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.16-rc4/2.6.16-rc4-mm1/broken-out/areca-raid-linux-scsi-driver.patch
Is this the current TODO list?
=================
Issues not yet patched:
13. uintNN_t int types:  use kernel types except for userspace
interfaces
14. use kernel-doc
18. Put arcmsr.txt in Documentation/scsi/, not in scsi/arcmsr/.
19. Maybe use sysfs (/sys) instead of /proc.
20. check stack usage, init/exit sections;
=================
   
At one point this comment was made:
"There's lots of architectural problems.  It's doing it's own queueing,
it's stuffing kernel structures into memory on the hardware and so on.
Basically someone knowledgeable about the hardware needs to start from
scratch on it."
What are the show stoppers that prevents a merge into the Linus tree?
