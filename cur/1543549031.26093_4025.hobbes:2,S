I guess I caught the tail end of DPT being nice. When i got the card it
was highly recommended.

I'm sorry for what I said. I'm just used to being able to easily contact
the author of software I'm working on wether they are still around or have
moved on. I was frustrated and tiered. The machine there DPT cards are on
are actually a community college where I do vollenteer sysadming for about
30 machines. This gives an entire lab of machines running Linux for CS
students. I only get 2-3 hours a week (if that) of actual time to keep the
lab up. Last friday I took a day off to finally complete the move to the
new kernel becasue of hacking attempts from students. I've tried off and
on for the past 6 months trying to get help from DPT/Adaptec because I was
always running into problems. And you know the rest of the story. I wish I
was more of kernel hacker but I'm basically a "patch and build" guy when
it comes to Linux. RT VxWorks on PPC is where all my hard-core development
goes. :| Sorry for causing problems and thanks for your help.
