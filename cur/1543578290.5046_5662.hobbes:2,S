On most processors <<2 is slower than *4.   It's outright stupid to 
write <<2 when we mean *4 in order to optimize for one out of a
gazillion supported architectures - even more so when the compiler
for the one CPU where <<2 is faster, will actually generate a shift
instead of a multiply as a part of the standard optimization.
One question for the GCC people:  Will gcc change <<2 to *4 on other 
architectures ?    If so, then my case is not quite as strong of course.
