FYI My T20 randomly hangs when suspending with 2.4.8. It seems to happen
more oftern when I've loaded many extra models, but that could just be
co-incidence. I haven't had time to upgrade to 2.4.16 yet....I will try
in a few days...
BTW: What do you mean by a 'wireless modem'? Do you mean a wireless NIC?
