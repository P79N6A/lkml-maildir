Running really out of options here. The dmesg shows that you're sharing 
the IRQ5 but it does not even show up in your int list. Your card seems to 
be sharing IRQ 5 with:
PCI: Sharing IRQ 5 with 0000:00:01.6
PCI: Sharing IRQ 5 with 0000:00:0c.1
IIRC one is the modem, and I do not remember the other one. If your BIOS 
has the option to shut those device off, you can try that. Also you can 
try (if you can) to change the interrupt pin.
