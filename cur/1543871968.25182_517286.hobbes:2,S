[having some mailer issues. Pl ignore if this is a duplicate]
This sounds like an issue in merge we recently had and 2.6.21-rc2-mm2 already
has a fix for this.
sched-fix-idle-load-balancing-in-softirqd-context-fix.patch  
Can you please apply both
sched-fix-idle-load-balancing-in-softirqd-context
sched-fix-idle-load-balancing-in-softirqd-context-fix.patch
and see if you still see this problem?
thanks,
suresh
