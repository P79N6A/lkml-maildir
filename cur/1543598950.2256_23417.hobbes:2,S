I've run a sustained 10Mbps tx & rx on 8 ports (2 of the Dlink 4-port NICs)
for over 24 hours on a 2.4.7 kernel.  I was not using bonding though.  I'm guessing you're
seeing lots of carrier errors, as the tulip driver used to be very bad
at...uh..working.  Try a 2.4.6 kernel or better and I bet your problem
goes away...
