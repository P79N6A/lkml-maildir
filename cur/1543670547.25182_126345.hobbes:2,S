Sorry Alan, "been there, done that"
I made ISDN work on just about anything that you would call an OS on sometimes
quite ancient hardware (compared to nowadays), and I really cannot imagine that
the combined (though sometimes confusing) efforts of you, Andre, Pavel, name-one
on IDE made a dual 1.4 GHz PIII slower (responding) than a M68k 7,14 MHz with a
polling IDE interface - which happens to be the slowest thing I ever did ISDN
programming on _flawlessly_.
