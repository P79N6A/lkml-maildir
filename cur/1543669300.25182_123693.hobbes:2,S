Subject: fsync() on unix domain sockets?

Let's say someone had written a win32 emulator that
ran in userspace, and was using unix domain sockets
to emulate win32 named pipes.  (Yes, this is how
Wine does it at the moment, but it's a poor fit,
and they're thinking of switching to emulating them 100%
in userspace so they can get the semantics right.)
It turns out that in this situation, it would be handy
for fsync() to work on unix domain sockets.  This would
require a bit of plumbing to let sockets expose an fsync() method,
together with an fsync() method for unix domain sockets.
After thinking about this a bit, I couldn't resist
writing that method for stream sockets.  Being a kernel newbie,
I am unsure if I got the locking and reference counting right.
Anyone care to peek at it and see if there are glaring problems?
(If not, I guess I could go do the needed plumbing and see how it works in practice.)
Thanks,
Dan
