Note that we really don't care about that "0.96bp2inc.tar.Z" file: that's 
just the kernel headers, and 0.96b-pl2 did _not_ contain the comments yet. 
But libc used to use the kernel headers for other things (for things like 
system call numbers etc).
It's almost certainly the "libc-2.2.2.tar.Z" file that we want - that's 
the one that is going to contain the sys_errlist[] lists etc. Note how 
this libc-2.2.2 announcement predates the merging of the kernel header by 
almost a month - the kernel header information came from libc, not the 
other way around.

Does anybody have old CD-ROM's lying around?
In particular, the Yggdrasil Linux/GNU/X alpha CD-ROM was apparently
released just a few months later. It would quite possibly contain the
libc-2.2.2 sources... Adam Richter is still active, and I added him to the
cc..
Who else was doing CD's back then? SLS? If nobody has the thing on a
web-site any more, maybe they exist in physical format on somebodys
bookshelf? The only reason that the really historic kernel archives still
exist is that people saved them, and even so we're missing versions 0.02
and 0.03, but by the latter half of -92 there were already CD-ROMs being 
manufactured...
Of course, maybe the CD's are unreadable by now.
