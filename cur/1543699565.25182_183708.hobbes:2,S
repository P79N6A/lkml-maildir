I was thinking about ideprobe_init_module() not ide_init() :-).

YES.  If you have some PCI IDE, you must load PCI chipset module before
loading ide-detect.o otherwise (you load ide-detect.o before your PCI chipset
module) generic IDE driver will own your IDE ports and you cannot use your
specific PCI chipset driver.

No, think about loading chipset modules.  Some (i.e. ide-cs.o) are
calling ide_register_hw() and expect that this function will probe drives
(without need to load ide-detect.o by user).  Change above preserves
current behavior (note that you may have more than one chipset module).
The same (probing for drives by chipset module) can be done for PCI
drivers but requires a some more work in case of 2.4.x kernels.
