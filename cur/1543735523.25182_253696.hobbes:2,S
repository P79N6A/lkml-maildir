Subject: [PATCH] Staircase cpu scheduler v8.4

A quick announcement that the latest version of the staircase cpu scheduler 
(v8.4) has been resynced with 2.6.9-rc2 and 2.6.9-rc2-mm1. They can both be 
found here:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.9/
Changes in the recent releases include much better cpu accounting for short 
running tasks improving fairness of cpu resources for such tasks, lots of 
little code cleanups and resyncing with current code.
Cheers,
Con
