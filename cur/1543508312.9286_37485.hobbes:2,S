I've found even more really bizarre behavior with 2.3.15,16,and 17pre1.
I don't seem to be able to run Netscape (either 4.0 or 4.6); instead,
when I launch it, I get a cheery
    orc@goo$ /usr/local/netscape/netscape
    ksh: /usr/local/netscape/netscape: Permission denied
    orc@goo$ ldd /usr/local/netscape/netscape
    ldd: can't execute /usr/local/netscape/netscape (Permission denied)
As root, of course, it's as happy as a clam.
This is a Mastodon system, so it's all a.out except for the elf
libraries, but it is running ld.so.1.9.9, has binutils 2.9.1, gcc
2.7.2.3, and netscape is being LD_LIBRARY_PATH'ed into a sandbox with
libc 5.4.46
The binary is owed by root, but is mode 555, and the directories
leading down to it are all a+rx'ed.   I even went so far as to
download (over a 26k phone line, ugh) newer copies of netscape
which exhibited the same antisocial behavior.
Hardware configuration:
    Amd K6/233.
    256mb ECC ram.
    VIA VP3 chipsetted motherboard.
    IDE disks.
    Baffled owner.

    david parsons \bi/ for what it's worth, civctp (glibc) DOES work on 
                   \/                                       this system.
