That's a different bug. The gcc PR has an assembler error message, as 
expected, whereas the kvm miscompile has a compiler error, which I don't 
understand.
Anyhow, your patch is correct (because selecting "i" is indeed 
erroneous) so I'll apply it, but I'm worried that there's a gcc bug in 
there that we ought to report.
