in foo.h
	struct blah {
		volatile int x;	/* need serialization
	}
2 million miles away
	blah.x = 1;
	blah.y = 4;
And you've no idea that its magically serialized due to a type declaration
in a header you've never read. Hence the "dont use volatile" rule

Yep. But Matthew answered that

spin_unlock ensures that local CPU writes before the lock are visible
to all processors before the lock is dropped but it has no effect on 
I/O ordering. Just a need for clarity.

The "legacy i386 hardware" bit. Many processors have an I/O space.
