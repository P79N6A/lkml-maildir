There is documentation on how submissions should look like.  Other than
that, these are case-by-case decisions based on a number of factors.
Perhaps you should look up discussions on merge requests (accepted as
well as rejected ones) in archives or better at sources like LWN.net.

If you don't want to start with an actual submission, you could begin
with discussing the specific features you have in mind directly with the
developers and maintainers of the existing cluster FSs.  Then it should
become clearer how to proceed most effectively.
