An obvious fix is an obvious fix.  It shouldn't matter whether people have
triggered a bug or not; why discriminate?

I disagree w/ this; if it's an obvious fix, there should be no need for
this.  Either it's a race that is clearly incorrect (after tracing through
the relevant code), or it's not.

This and the "it must fix a problem" are basically saying the same thing.

It seems like this would be the primary thing that matters.  The rest of
them (aside from the "fixes only one thing" and "no cleanups" rules)
overlap considerably.
