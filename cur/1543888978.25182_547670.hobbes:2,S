What happens if the lower layer is on a read only medium.  But the top 
layer is RW.  Why can't one change permissions?  In your model, one can't.
What happens if one wants to share a lower layer read-only (I'm doing 
this with my research into uses of union file systems), one doesn't want 
permission change in one use of the lower layer to affect any of the 
other uses.

If the lower layer is relatively immutable (ignoring atime) it can be 
shared in a RO manner by multiple unions.  If it's not, it can't be. 
Also, copyup is needed in general as the RO union layer can be on a RO 
file system but the union will not be RO.
