I believe he was talking about some of the example one-liners cited
earlier. Not a significant chance of those getting "more complex" such
that they become cumbersome...

The codebase has been, is now, and forever will be split, due to
differing goals, and the fact that one size does not fit all... Not to
mention personal taste. The splits will only be as large a practicality
allows, given the number of trees trying to sync from, or with -linus.
The -ac tree got pretty splorked off for a while, though.
By the way, Linus, Alan, Al Viro, Marcello, Ingo, Stephen, Rik, Dave,
Dave, any other Daves, Geert, Jens, Andre, Richard, hpa, Hans, and
everyone I can't think of, THANKS for making my machine run fast, die
hard, and just for putting out better code than a huge corporation can!
