After looking at cups (1.1.18) backend/usb.c and the kernel's 
(2.4.19-gentoo-r10) drivers/usb/printer.c I've found some different 
interpretations of the LP_* flags from linux/lp.h
While the kernel seems to use the 8255 status port definitions, which use
(amongst others) the flags,
#define LP_PSELECD      0x10  /* unchanged input, active high */
#define LP_PERRORP      0x08  /* unchanged input, active low */
the same bits are defined by POSIX guidelines a few lines above in 
linux/lp.h:
#define LP_OFFL  0x0008
#define LP_NOPA  0x0010
Obviously, this leads the cups usb-backend to incorrectly report an empty 
media tray when the printer is online, idle and has enough paper.
This doesn't seem to be something serious, its just a wrong message in cups 
log-file.
Greetings

PS: Since two different specifications are mixed up, this problem could also 
be a kernel problem.
