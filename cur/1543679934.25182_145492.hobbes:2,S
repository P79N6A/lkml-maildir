Subject: [ANN] rng-tools 1.0 released

Version 1.0 of the rng-tools package has been released to
	
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel
This is the userspace support package for i810_rng / amd768_rng (2.4) 
and hw_random (2.5) device drivers.
The general idea is that you have a userspace daemon obtaining random 
data from one or more sources, run it through a bunch of "make sure it's 
really random" sanity checks, and then add that entropy to the kernel's 
/dev/random entropy pool.
Future directions include Via RNG support completely in userspace, and 
support for entropy sources other than a single /dev file.
Contributions and critical review of this package welcome.

P.S.  Future release announcements will occur only via SourceForge's 
automated release notification system.  This is a fairly minor package, 
and I don't want to spam lkml.
