It is possible - USB now supports autosuspend. After a long debate, it was 
however devcided that it is explicitly turned off, and userspace is free 
to turn it on via sysfs interface for whatever devices the user likes to 
do so.
This is mainly because there is a huge load of USB devices out there that 
don't support this feature correctly, and we will break them if we perform 
autosuspend automatically.

How would you know how exactly respond to poll() that no userspace program 
gets confused? There are many different kinds of USB devices.
