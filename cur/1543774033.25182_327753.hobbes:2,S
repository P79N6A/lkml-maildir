That's good to hear, but here are some random stats from the
idle run:
Measurements   |   Vanilla   |  preemp_rt     |   ipipe
---------------+-------------+----------------+-------------
fork           |      95us   |  157us (+65%)  |   97us (+2%)
open/close     |     1.4us   |  2.1us (+50%)  |  1.4us (~)
execve         |     355us   |  452us (+27%)  |  365us (+3%)
select 500fd   |    12.7us   | 27.7us (+118%) | 12.7us (~)
mmap           |     660us   | 2886us (+337%) |  673us (+2%)
...            |      ...    |   ...          |   ...
Here's a under ping flood conditions:
Measurements   |   Vanilla   |  preemp_rt     |   ipipe
---------------+-------------+----------------+-------------
fork           |     112us   |  223us (+99%)  |  121us (+8%)
open/close     |     1.7us   |  3.0us (+76%)  |  1.8us (+6%)
execve         |     421us   |  652us (+55%)  |  467us (+11%)
select 500fd   |    14.6us   | 38.1us (+161%) | 15.5us (+6%)
mmap           |     760us   | 3936us (+418%) |  819us (+8%)
...            |      ...    |   ...          |   ...
etc. it's like this accross the board.
Unless that fix you mention above takes care of these, there's
something seriously wrong going on here.
Are there existing LMbench results posted of PREEMPT_RT which
one can go back to for comparison?
