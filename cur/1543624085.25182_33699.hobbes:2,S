Mostly I found it an inconvenience. When playing with big files (say
around 1 MiB), you had to remember to purge periodically. I can't
recall being grateful that this feature existed.
Certainly, when I switched to Unix, I didn't miss file versioning.
I question how useful it really is, except in certain specialised
applications (like SCM, where we have tools to fit the job).
