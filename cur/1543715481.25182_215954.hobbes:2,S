No need to mention this.  I'll stop whenever I feel like it.

I know the encrypted text and I know it is common, so the uncompressed
decrypted text is likely 0x00,...  Now, what may the compressed
decyphered text be?  It could be:
000,000,...
001,001,...
010,010,...
011,011,...
.

Actually, the 000 and 111 cases don't even have three variants
depending on when they start, so the 48 above comes down to 40.  And
since I honestly don't case whether it was 0x00 or 0xff, that was
encrypted to 001,001,..., it even comes down to 20.
You are right, I don't know which one of those 20 it is, but I am
quite sure it is one of them.

Show me the paper.  Since when is AES weak against known plaintext
attacks?
