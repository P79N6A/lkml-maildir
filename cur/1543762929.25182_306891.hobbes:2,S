In some cases you can simply count jiffies - depending on how accurate you 
need to time things I'd say that often something like this is adequate :
unsigned long start, time_spent;
start = jiffies;
/* do stuff */
time_spent = jiffies - start;
printk("stuff took %d jiffies (%d seconds)\n", time_spent, time_spent/HZ);
