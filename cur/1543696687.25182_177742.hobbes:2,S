Hello,
I am attempting to get a CompactFlash reader to work (Soyo SB-K7VXBP).  The 
device sits in a 3.5" bay and plugs directly into a USB1 connector on my 
motherboard.  It also provides two USB ports, which work.
The CompactFlash reader almost works.  At bootup, I get this message:
hub 3-0:1.0: new USB device on port 1, assigned address 2
scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
  Vendor: SOYO      Model: USB Storage-SMC   Rev: 0214
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Attached scsi removable disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
WARNING: USB Mass Storage data integrity not assured
USB Mass Storage device found at 2
The device shows up in /sys/block/sda and in 
/sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb-storage.  Also, /dev/sda is created as a symlink to 
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc (I am using devfs).
However, when try to mount /dev/sda, I get an error saying "No medium 
found".  I have tried inserting the card after booting and also before 
booting, with the same result.  I am using the 2.6.0-test9 kernel, but I 
have had this device since early 2.4 and it has never worked.  It is not 
damaged hardware because Windows detects it as a drive.
Trying to run fdisk on /dev/sda gives the message "Unable to open /dev/sda". 
  Is there something else I need to do, or any more information I can 
provide to debug this problem?
Thanks,
Jim
