Joerg, enough with the personal attacks. That you didn't see the reply is just 
proof that you don't read the entirety of messages posted or sent to you 
directly. 
here is both responses:
in one he posts the contents of a single line of code that he added to the 
linux wrapper code in libscg.
In the second he asks for a guarantee that you will stand behind your 
(somewhat sketchy) posted guidelines for patches.
And what follows from here out is the relevant portions of the messages, 
complete with the "Message ID" field from the headers in case you want to dig 
through you inbox or wherever you misfiled these responses to read the 
entirety of them.

I am aiming for a compromise.
My point is that people want to use dev=/dev/hdc in their interface,
because that's what they are used to. That's a point that I think you
cannot deny.
If you want to still keep your dev=b,t,l command line interface, just
let the users know how your mapping is done. That will allow a
cdrecord wrapper to first query the mapping, then using this mapping
information and OS specific information (e.g. links) identify the
b,t,l expected by your interface.
That way you have mostly no code change to do. And you keep your b,t,l
naming. Everybody is happy.
I've added something like:
                fprintf(stdout, "%d,%d,%d <= /dev/%s\n",
                                first_free_schilly_bus, t, l, 
token[ID_TOKEN_SUBSYSTEM] );
in scsi-linux-ata.c and it does what I want.
WDYT?
Cheers,
Jerome

I am still waiting for an answer as to whether such a patch would be
accepted. We will take on the practical details later on.
