Subject: possible performance issue in 4-level page tables

There is a performance regression of lmbench
lat_proc fork result on ia64.
in 
2.6.10 
I got 
Process fork+exit:164.8438 microseconds.
in 2.6.11-rc2
Process fork+exit:183.8621 microseconds.
I believe this regression was caused by 
the 4-level page tables change.
Since most of the kernel time spend in lat_proc fork is copy_page_range
in fork path and clear_page_range in the exit path. Now they are 1 level
deeper.
Though pud and pgd is same on IA64, there is still some overhead
introduced I think.
Are any other architectures seeing the same sort of results?
