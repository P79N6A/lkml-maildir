It looks correct to me, please apply it.  If it breaks people's boxes
that used to work, I'm sure I'll hear about it :)

I don't really know, I think that happened before both Len and I took
over this code base.  I don't have a problem with doing it in this
order, but I'm sure there's some ACPI issue that I'm not aware of that
needs to be run first.

For a box such as this one, it would make sense to do it in this order,
I agree.
