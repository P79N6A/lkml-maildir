Again that is what is has been implemented.  A fully stand alone executable
that lives in an independent and reserved address in memory is jumped
to.
The goal in the generic kernel is to keep the code path to do that
as small and as simple as possible to reduce the chances of it being
mis-implemented, or the chances of attempting to use corrupted kernel
functionality.
