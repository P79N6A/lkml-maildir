If I remember correctly people are bit uneasy about putting
decompression of proprietary codecs into to the kernel.
See
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg04778.html
Every kernel release I end up building an external module just to get my
OV518 usb webcam to work. (It requires decompression support) Not cool.

I think ovcamchip is from the development branch, but ov511 is from the
stable branch. Not sure about that. Best bet is contact Mark McClelland
(maintainer) here:
mmcclell <atsign> calpoly.edu 
or mark <atsign> alpha.dyndns.org
