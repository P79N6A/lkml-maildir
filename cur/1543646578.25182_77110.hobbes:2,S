Dear All,
Can I know the file system that is used in the embedded devices 
based on linux? i.e whether it is RAM DISK based file system or 
JFFS.
Because, currently I am using RAM DISK file system of size 8 MB. 
When i try to increase the size beyond 11 MB the kernel crashes 
during boot. Again If i try to use 11 or 10 MB RAM DISK file 
system, the kernel boots successfully but i am not able to load 
some of the kernel modules.
But i need a file system of size atleast 11 MB.
Can any body throw some light on this?
with best regards,
Purush
(Note : my target board has 32 MB RAM.)
