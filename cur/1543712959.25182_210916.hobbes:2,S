I suspect that the reap timer is innocent and what we have is simply
scribbled-on slab metadata.  Which means it could be anything at all.
One last thing: could you please stick a
	printk(KERN_EMERG "destroying slab %s\n", cachep->name);
at the start of slab_destroy()?  That'll help narrow it down.
Could you also punt me over the .config?  If I can make it happen, the
binary search will find it.  But it probably won't happen here.
