If two threads have a workload that wants to be co-scheduled then the SMP
scheduler will do damage to them anyway - independently of any HT
scheduling decisions. One solution for such specific cases is to use the
CPU-binding API to move those threads to the same physical CPU. If there's
some common class of applications where this is the common case, then we
could start thinking about automatic support for them.
