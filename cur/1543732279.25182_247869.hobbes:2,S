My system is all reiserfs though the Fedora core box I also did testing
on was EXT3. 
wizej:/home/wisej/packages # mount
/dev/hda3 on / type reiserfs (rw,acl,user_xattr)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,mode=0620,gid=5)
/dev/hda1 on /boot type reiserfs (rw,acl,user_xattr)
/dev/hdc on /media/cdrecorder type subfs (ro,nosuid,nodev,fs=cdfss,
procuid,iocharset=utf8)
usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
