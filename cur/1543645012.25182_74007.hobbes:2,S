Yes, you are correct, the comment is wrong.  We switched to returning
the tgid in early 2.4 when CLONE_THREAD was introduced.  The tgid and
pid are identical unless CLONE_THREAD was used.
Attached patch fixes the typo and adds some comments explaining this. 
Marcelo, patch is against 2.4.20-pre8, please apply.
