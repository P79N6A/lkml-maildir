I think these are two different cases. One is the file semantics the other
is the file format itself. CRLF->LF conversion has always been bad even on
the native windows platforms.

Only the .lnk files that can be properly interpreted as symlinks are
showing up as symlink as far as I can tell. This is quite ok and very
helpful. .lnk file interpretation can be switched off and on as a boot
option.

As said before the vfat fs would only display the convertable shortcuts
and not all.

I cannot decompress a tarball with symlinks on a vfat volume without that
patch. With that patch I can use the vfat volume like a unix fs. I can
boot XP running Cygwin and build another binary from the same sources.
vfat with the patch can *create* symlinks that are compatible with other
oses.
The patch is a must have ....
