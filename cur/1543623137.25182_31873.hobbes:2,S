In regards to crypto code in the kernel, read the legal advise given to 
Debian: 
http://www.debian.org/legal/cryptoinmain
Sounds pretty simple and basically we are free to put crypto into code 
released from the US, we just need to make the proper notification.
Same steps that were taken last year for the LK mirrors, all of which 
should post a summary statement to this effect.
