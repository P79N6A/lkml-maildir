To me, it proves that the bios triggers the problem. It could also be in
the device enumeration functions or device initialization that it does
this thing. Perhaps even a more nasty thing such as a pending DMA write
which completes during a device reset. That's very odd anyway. I don't
quite remember well all your setup. Have you tried enabling/disabling
shadow ram/caching on bios regions to check if a faster/slower code execution
in the bios changes something ? Also do it on additionnal ROMs if you have
an onboard bios on your secondary controller.
I'm also getting stuck without any other idea :-/
Regards,
Willy
