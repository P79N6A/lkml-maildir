I have a VFAT (FAT32) filesystem that started behaving strangely once I 
upgraded to 2.2.1.  It involves handling of directories, and is a little 
hard to explain, but here goes:
Say for example that I am in /mnt/win95/cdda and type cd .. One would 
expect that to take me to /mnt/win95, right?  Wrong!  It takes me to 
/mnt sometimes, and sometimes it will do the correct thing.  Similar strange 
occurences were happening throughout this filesystem.  So I decided to go 
back to 2.0.36, so I typed cd /etc and then pico lilo.conf.  Then it siad 
that there was no such file.  So I exited pico, and I was back in 
/mnt/win95/cdda.  These directories are not random, they are all 
directories that I have used before.  Is there any upgrade or something 
that I am overlooking, or is this really a bug?  BTW, I went back to 
2.0.36, and all is behaving normally.
