Unfortunately what I'm seeing in 2.6.20.1 seems to differ from this.  If 
I use the options below:
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_PCI=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS=32
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS=16
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_EXTENDED=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_MANY_PORTS=y
# CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_FOURPORT is not set
# CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_ACCENT is not set
# CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_BOCA is not set
# CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_EXAR_ST16C554 is not set
# CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_HUB6 is not set
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_SHARE_IRQ=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_DETECT_IRQ=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_RSA=y
# Non-8250 serial port support
Then I can only access ttyS0 through ttyS3 sith setserial.  Only after I add
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_FOURPORT=y am I actually able to do anything with the 
additional ports.  I would otherwise get the evil setserial: invalid 
parameter error.
If you'd like I can offline you my complete .config file.  lemme know.

OK.  Fair enough.  My question then becomes, how does the driver deal 
with this now? scan all applicable uarts when any relevant interrupt is 
detected (as identified in setserial)?
Thanks.
