You must not have heard of IBM mainframes - one of the mainframe
OSes is CALLED VM (Virtual Machine), and the S/3X0 hardware is fully
virtualisable, so you can run any number of copies of the OS inside
itself (even the Linux s390 port runs under VM).

I think the hypervisor is a made-up term, the "supervisor of supervisors
(kernels)".  I think what Alan means is that as long as the Linux kernel
APIs are available, and the "CPU" can run x86 code from normal programs,
the kernel itself can be running a totally different machine language.
At one time (long ago) there was talk about an IBM PowerPC 635? which
had a PPC core and a 386 core, and the 386 core was only for x86 program
"emulation", but the OS would run under PPC.  I think that Crusoe could
(does?) do this with Linux - with the kernel (maybe libraries too?) running
in native mode, and the user code running either the (presumably slower) x86
mode or the (presumably faster) native VLIW mode.
Whether Crusoe does this now, or in the future, I don't know.  Maybe it is
running x86 mode just to test that the x86 mode is very compatible (needed
until Windows goes away) and it will slowly migrate to native VLIW mode as
applications/compilers support it.
Cheers, Andreas
