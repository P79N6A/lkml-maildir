Wouldn't it be better to just separate it out?  I.e. make i386
an arch of its own, while most pc people use a "486 and up" arch?
The few who actually want 386 code won't loose it, and other developers
won't have to bother with 386 issues.  Then drop the 386 arch when it
dies from lack of maintenance...
