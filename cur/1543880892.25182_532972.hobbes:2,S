I think we're running in circle here.
1. The driver's lifetime rules matters but currently the driver model
imposes reference counted model to each struct device.
2. You can decouple struct device completely from actual driver
implementation.
I agree with you that #2 is possible but just don't think it's the right
thing to do.  By making struct device independent from driver
implementation doesn't help solving lifetime problems in drivers.  It
just insulates driver model from those.
