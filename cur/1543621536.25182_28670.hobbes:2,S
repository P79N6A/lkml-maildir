Hi,
since 2.5.x (can't remember version correctly) the setup for RAM disk changed and I could not build it anymore into the kernel due to compilation errors.
In the latest prepatch (2.5.5-pre1) this is still not fixed. I am using the following patch to fix this and it works from 2.5.x upto 2.5.5-pre1 without any problems.
please apply,
Rudmer
PS. CC me as I am not on the list
