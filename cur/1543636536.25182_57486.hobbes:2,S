Ok, I am still having problems booting 2.4.19-rc2-ac2.... I get an APIC
error on CPU0 (and CPU1).  However, I tried 2.4.19-rc2 with my Promise
SX6000 and get a slightly different result than 2.4.18.  It almost looks
like the hard drives attached to the promise sx6000 are being
initialized before it gets to the i2o code and the i2o block driver is
unable to initialize /dev/i2o/hda (but thats a wild guess from my
limited knowledge).  If someone has any ideas, please let me know.
Thanks
Amith
Here is output from dmesg (the important parts - i can provide more if
needed)
