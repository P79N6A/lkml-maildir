Not sure. Sometimes system is totaly unusable. Sometimes I can switch to console and 
do limited operations there. Will look into it, will play with netconsole.

Yes it does.

Thanks for tip. Till now I usually added something like
*.*                     /dev/tty13
to my /etc/syslog.conf. I guess if sysklogd was somehow 'blocked' I shouldn't
have seen anything, not even the very first sysrq line right?
I'll dig some more and try to catch some data.
