I had an attempt a while ago to do this but haven't had enough time to get it completed, so
I am glad to see it finally picked up. There was some sort of discussion that time, you seem to have some of those points
addressed but  something not, please
check: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/8/45
(for instance, cpm_i2c_shutdown() and i2c_cpm_del_bus() are void because they cant' fail) 
Also, why this was directed to Scott? This is lm-sensors stuff and is
Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org> material...
