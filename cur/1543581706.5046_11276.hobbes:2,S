	This is because the 2.2.XX contains the a later version of the
driver when compared to 2.4.1 kernel. I have submitted to Linus and Alan the
1.14g version of the driver which works for 2.2.XX and contains special code
for 2.4.XX kernels.
	As the file is too large for me post to LKML i have submitted the
patch to Linus and Alan which i guess will be in the next incremental
release of both 2.2.19 and 2.4.1-pre?
	Thanks,
	Venkatesh
