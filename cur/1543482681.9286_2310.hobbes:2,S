Yep, there is already a madvise() fuction in most modern unixen: it is
especially useful for giving cache hints.

Yes.  I see what you mean.  We should immediately remove Linux support
for FAT filesystems, the ISA bus and 8086 virtual mode.
Not.

*One* of the primary goals.  The other was protected multitasking.  The
x86 architecture today is perfectly well capable of supporting mutliple
32-bit address spaces within a 36 bit (64GB) physical address space, and
large multiuser environments would benefit enormously from such an
environment.

So?  IDE is crap because it doesn't support multiple outstanding
commands.  If you honestly believe that this means we should remove IDE
support from the kernel, then you are living on another planet where
getting real work done by real users doesn't matter.  Fact is, we _can_
support this stuff, and users want us to.
