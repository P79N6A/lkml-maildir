A single PAGE_SIZE allocation is quite common. Lots of kernel structures 
end up (often for historical reasons) being that size. PATH_MAX, for one. 
Sometimes it's also simply because it's the one "known" size that doesn't 
cause fragmentation and is easily available, so..
In other words, it's often the "canonical size" for some random buffer: 
if only because it's known to be the largest possible buffer that is 
always available.
