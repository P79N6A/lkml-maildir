Looking at the code, this is not a real HW pgdir but rather the
page copy list specific to swsusp. AFAIK, the HW pgdir is copied over.

Yes, the pgdir is there, but 1) it's getting overwriten, so if it
doesn't contain the same large page mapping on old and new, we are
screwed and 2) if accessing the linear mapping (when copying pages)
require going one level deeper into the page tables, then we are
possibly screwed too since those will be partly overwriten and won't
ever be in a "sane" state until the full copy is done.
Note that I don't have that problem with my current PPC hacks, as I
disable the MMU for the copy :)
