On IA64 platform, ACPI interpreter seems to be mandatory for those
stuff, but IA32 is not.  So, the ram disk is the generic solution 
for loading user space interpreter for boot.

Yes, it needs a lot of work.  If we want to continue, we should find out
what's the benefit of doing so. The biggest benefit could be that kernel
will be less complex, thus kernel will be more stable.  At least, some
ACPI operation (like information query) is not needed to be handled in
kernel in synchronous manner, which is kernel invoking ACPI interpreter
like calling a C function. On laptop, I DO get many bug reports that
kernel 
crashes, or hang for a while ,or input event lost..., just due to AML
call executed
by ACPI interpreter running in the kernel.  I expect all this symptom
will
be gone, if interpreter is running in user space.
