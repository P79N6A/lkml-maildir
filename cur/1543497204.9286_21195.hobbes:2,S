Hi
We are a couple of students trying to create a network memory pager on a
linux system. The pager is implemented as a device driver, which should be
mounted as swapping device. However, we rely heavily on inter process
communication. So far we have not been able to figure out how to use these
calls in the driver. Or even if it is possible at all. 
Any help would be apreciated.
Michael
