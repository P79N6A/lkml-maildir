That jibes with what I would expect (I missed the older threads, but
was nonetheless toying with this idea myself)...
Function arguments on the stack are likely to be in L1 cache anyway,
so accessing arguments is already pretty cheap.  And storing the
parameters in registers might increase the number of spills slightly,
for cases, where an argument isn't used much, or at all.
Ideally unit-at-a-time could figure out the optimal -mregparm value :)

Well...  even with completely open source, you're never gonna have a
working system with modules built using compiler versions and options
that differ from the main kernel image.  In the past, changing compiler
versions would definitely affect the module interfaces adversely.
So while I agree with your overall conservatism, worrying about
supporting miscompiled modules is the road to Hades...
