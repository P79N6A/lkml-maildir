Well to summarize:  The kernel should not dictate policy.
That's the end of that.
That being said, the pIII kernel patches have always had this config option
so this argument is really a moot point.

That's all well and good except that enabling a PSN from a disabled state
requires a restart.   Disabling a PSN from an enabled state does not.
In any case the question is moot.  I may want to use a pIII serial number
when a mac address is likely to change and I still want to have a enterprise-
wide installation/upgrade system (and assuming of course that all machines
in that network support PSN).  The kernel should never dictate policy.  If
someone wants to hang himself in the opinion of someone else, it should
let him.
There are no checks in the kernel for unlink of / or /lib, nor should
there be.
