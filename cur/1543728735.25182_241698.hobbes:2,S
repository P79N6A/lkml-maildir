There are no such kernel processes. Linux and other Unixes perform
functions on behalf of the caller. If there is some task hogging
the CPU then `top` will show it.

Some task, waiting for I/O to complete, will automatically
get the CPU taken away and given to some other task that
is not waiting for I/O to complete.

The problems you describe are most likely caused by your hard-disk
and/or driver. If you have an IDE drive with no DMA capability, you
are stuck. If you have ATA, Fiberchannel, SCSI or something professional
your processes will get CPU time while I/O is occurring.
