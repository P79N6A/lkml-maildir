ah, indeed. Note that this is still not enough - please try to add a
local_irq_enable() to netconsole.c's console-write function - does that
fix it equally well for you?
the reason is that if we crash within an irqs-off section then
netconsole will still be called with interrupts disabled and will
trigger the assert.
