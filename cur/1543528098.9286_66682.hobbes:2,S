I recompiled everything including
   2.2.15pre11
   pcmcia 3.1.11
   pppd 2.3.11
and my ppp data continues to stop at the end of large transfers
outbound from the system.  (scp's and qmail-remote xfers)
Attached is a 'tcpdump -i ppp0' of an 'scp smallfile home:'
The destination system is a 2.2.15pre9 system.
