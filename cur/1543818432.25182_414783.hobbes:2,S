My SIGNAL_GROUP_EXEC change made this spot check for either flag, but this
already holds true for the exec case and so my change to this check here
was not needed.  With the coredump change done, I concur that the exit
cases are covered too and so this check can go.  For paranoia's sake,
perhaps we should leave behind a BUG_ON.
Thanks,
Roland
