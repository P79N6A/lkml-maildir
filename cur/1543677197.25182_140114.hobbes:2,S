BZZZT.  If another CPU is also doing atomic_inc_and_read you could end
up with both calls returning the same value.
You can't do atomic_inc_and_read on 386.  You can on cpus that have
cmpxchg (e.g. later x86).  You can also on machines with load-locked
and store-conditional instructions (alpha, ppc, probably most other
RISCs).
