Could we just plainly avoid adding any new syscalls which take a
filename without extending the interface like the *at functions?
I.e., add a file descriptor parameter, handle AT_FDCWD, etc.  The
additional effort is really minimal.  Even if, as in this case, the
function is propably not used in situations where the filename use is
racy there are still those people to consider who want to implement a
virtual per-thread current working directory.
