Yes, that's true.
More generally, though, is there any point in this going in to the
mainline kernel, if:
* Most users don't need faster entropy generation than we've got
and
* The entropy gathered from the soundcard is statistically inferior to
that gathered from the current sources of entropy.
I don't see how it's possible to guarantee that the data below a
certain dB level from the soundcard is noise.
John.
