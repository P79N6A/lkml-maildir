Would it be possible for you to attached a 'before' picture of slabinfo,
as well as 'after'?

I don't recall how du works exactly... if it uses stat(2), it should not
be broken AFAIK.
As for 'df', that will definitely show zero, because ramfs does not do
filesystem accounting in its present form.  You might consider trying a
modified version of ramfs, as found in Alan Cox's 'ac' patchkit.  This
patchkit includes a modified ramfs which supports limiting filesystem
size, but more importantly (for you), it should make 'df' work again.
