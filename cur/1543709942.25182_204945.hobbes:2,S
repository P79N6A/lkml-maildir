The patch for DMA based CD reading worked well for me until I tried to
read the audio from a badly damaged CDR.  At this point the code dropped
back to the old mechanism and stayed that way for further CDs.
The logs below show what happened, running 2.6.4-rc2 with just that
patch:
cdrom: open failed.
hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: packet command error: error=0x30
ATAPI device hdc:
  Error: Medium error -- (Sense key=0x03)
  (reserved error code) -- (asc=0x57, ascq=0x00)
  The failed "Prevent/Allow Medium Removal" packet command was:
  "1e 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 "
cdrom: open failed.
hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: packet command error: error=0x30
ATAPI device hdc:
  Error: Medium error -- (Sense key=0x03)
  (reserved error code) -- (asc=0x57, ascq=0x00)
  The failed "Prevent/Allow Medium Removal" packet command was:
  "1e 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 "
cdrom: cdda rip sense 03/02/00
cdrom: dropping to old style cdda
hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: packet command error: error=0x30
ATAPI device hdc:
  Error: Medium error -- (Sense key=0x03)
  (reserved error code) -- (asc=0x02, ascq=0x00)
  The failed "Read CD" packet command was:
  "be 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 08 f8 00 00 00 00 00 00 "
... and the above pattern eventually becomes this:
ide-cd: cmd 0xbe timed out
hdc: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: irq timeout: error=0xd0LastFailedSense 0x0d
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
ide-cd: cmd 0xbe timed out
hdc: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: irq timeout: error=0xd0LastFailedSense 0x0d
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
ide-cd: cmd 0xbe timed out
hdc: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: irq timeout: error=0xd0LastFailedSense 0x0d
hdc: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: status timeout: error=0xd0LastFailedSense 0x0d
hdc: drive not ready for command
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
At some point in the sequence I killed grip and ejected the CD.
