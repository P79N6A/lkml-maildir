it seems there has been a change in the format of the /proc/cpuinfo file: infact 'flags: ' became 'features: '
This change broke xmms and could broke any other program which relies on /proc/cpuinfo... 
I hope the problem will be solved (in the kernel or in every other program which uses /proc/cpuinfo) soon...
Bye
