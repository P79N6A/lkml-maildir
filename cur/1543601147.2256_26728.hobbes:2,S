is it right with the following:
A)
 tasklets scheduled by a irq-handler may interrupt 
 1) the request fuction of a block device driver
 2) a open/close system call of a block device driver
B)
 if i don't want to be interrupted by a tasklet i need
 to call local_bh_disable or because (i've to use spin-
 locks anyway) spin_lock_bh.
thank
