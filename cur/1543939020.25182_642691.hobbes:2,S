Subject: [PATCH 09/19] dlm: clear ast_type when removing from astqueue
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/24/196

The lkb_ast_type field indicates whether the lkb is on the astqueue list.
When clearing locks for a process, lkb's were being removed from the astqueue
list without clearing the field.  If release_lockspace then happened
immediately afterward, it could try to remove the lkb from the list a second
time.
Appears when process calls libdlm dlm_release_lockspace() which first
closes the ls dev triggering clear_proc_locks, and then removes the ls
(a write to control dev) causing release_lockspace().
