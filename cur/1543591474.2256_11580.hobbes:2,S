why is it that so many people seem to think that it's a good thing to only
use precompiled kernels from the distro?
a kernel tuned for a particular machine can boot faster and run faster
then a 'stock' kernel.
unless you want to replace the kernel compile config options with a
similar sized menu to select between precompiled kernels with the correct
options (never mind what that will do to the size of the distros to ship
so many kernels)
