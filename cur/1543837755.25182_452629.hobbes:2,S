#1 seems to safe enough to assume.
#2 either doesn't make sense to me or is assuming things about the file 
handle
that the client is not allowed to assume.  A file handle is an opaque string
of bytes to the client.  The only entity allowed to interpret the contents
is the entity which generated the file handle.

Is this situation any different than an application opens file, "A".  
Another
process then renames "A" to "B".  Now, the original application is 
reading and
writing from and to a file called "B" and has no knowledge of this.
---
The bottom line is that the file handle uniquely identifies a particular
entity on a file system on the server.  The name of the entity does not
matter.
    Thanx...
