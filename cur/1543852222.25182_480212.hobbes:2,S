But freeze_bdev() is supposed to return the result of get_super(bdev)
_unconditionally_.  Moreover, in its current form freeze_bdev() _cannot_
_fail_, so I don't see how this change doesn't break any existing code.
For example freeze_filesystems() (recently added to -mm) will be broken
if the down_trylock() is unsuccessful.
Greetings,
Rafael
