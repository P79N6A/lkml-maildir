David, these all look like they are due to the calls in the
drivers/usb/gadget/epautoconf.c file from functions within the gadget
drivers.  It looks like it's all safe, but can you verify that the bind
callback is finished before module_init() exits?
And if so, we should mark the bind functions __init also, to prevent
this from being flagged in the future.

This looks like the isp116x_remove function just needs to get the looney
__init_or_module marking of of it.  Again, David, do you agree?
thanks,
