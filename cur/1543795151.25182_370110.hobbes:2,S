GREAT! ... So then Adrian's patch with my ACK should be applied, in 
addition to a similar patch for saa7134-dvb ...  I'd like to try Sam's 
method on my machine... if it works, then I will send in a new patch on 
Friday.

More than likely, I would assume that the issue has something to do with 
some code inside nxt200x.c that makes some additional devices visible on 
the i2c bus... This should only affect devices that use nxt200x module, 
but perhaps there is something going on that is causing interference on 
the i2c bus of your card?  This is just a guess.... Results from your 
cvs test will show us some better information.
If you are successfully loading cx88-dvb WITHOUT nxt200x module (before 
the cold boot) then the above is not the case.
Meanwhile, I repeat, it is well-known that the media tree is broken in 
2.6.15 ... I think we'll get better results after Hugh Dickin's sends in 
another patch.  In the meantime, you can test the v4l + dvb code using 
the merge-trees build method on the cvs repositories.  (see below)
