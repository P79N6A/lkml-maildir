well I don't know, I don't use this box full time, but quite a lot, I do
a lot of compiling on it. Run Mozilla, etc on it, copy big files, etc,
but I never had any serious "lock" problems, where everthing freezes for
a second like I have from time to time in 2.4

well on my working bux I run 2.4.22-ck3 and this has a lot of preempt
workstation speedup stuff inside, but it still freezes from time to time
if there is a peak in workload.

well test11 is very smooth. I haven't tried Nick scheduler but I might
give it a shot, just to see how the "xterm craziness" goes ... :)
