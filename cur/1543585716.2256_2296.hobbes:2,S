This is so blatantly incorrect as to be laughable. BIND 4 and 8 had a
long and glorious history of serious security flaws; a quick search of
the www.securityfocus.com vulnerability archives for "BIND" returns a
ton of results, ranging from root compromises to denial of service
attacks to cache poisoning problems.

I'll believe in BIND 9's safety after it's been widely deployed; with few
OS vendors actually bundling BIND 9 at this point, it's received very
little real-world attention.

Until the next design flaw produces yet-another-vulnerability?
While other packages might not be free software, I don't have the luxury
of following principles in lieu of security.
Last post from me on the subject, because this has next to nothing to do
with the Linux kernel.
