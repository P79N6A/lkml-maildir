Merged into -mm or not, modular /proc/config.gz remains an
utterly redundant kernel feature that user-space doesn't need.
User-space knows how to locate modules for the running kernel,
including the module implementing /proc/config.gz; therefore
it can replace the module file with the corresponding config
data, without loss of functionality.
All that's needed is to standardise the location of the
config file; /lib/modules/`uname -r`/config.gz seems a
reasonable choice.
