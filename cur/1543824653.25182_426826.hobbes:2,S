When you are adding a check that will _never_ be hit in production, to 
the _hottest_ paths in the kernel, you can be assured it matters...

Key phrase:  "early on"
These checks will only be useful during _early_ development of a new DMA 
platform.  For _100%_ of the real world users, these checks are useless. 
  Not 99%, 100%.
