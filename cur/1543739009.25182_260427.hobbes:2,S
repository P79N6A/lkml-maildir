Yep, it is.

I just tried switching CONFIG_HIGHMEM off, and so running the
machine with 512MB; then adjusted the test to write 256M into
the page cache, again in 1K sequential chunks.  A similar mis-
behaviour happens, though the numbers are slightly better (up
from ~4 to ~6.5MB/sec).  Both ext2 and xfs see this.  When I
drop the file size down to 128M with this kernel, I see good
results again (as we'd expect).
I'm being pulled onto other issues atm, but in the background
I could try reverting specific changesets if you guys can
suggest anything in particular that might be triggering this?
thanks!
