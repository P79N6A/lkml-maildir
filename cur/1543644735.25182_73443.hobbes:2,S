Hello
I just upgraded one of our firewalls to 2.4.19.
After working for 15 minutes the eth0 turned dead (the MZ running there),
showing the next message in the kernel:
Sep 25 07:51:37 machine_gun kernel: eepro100: wait_for_cmd_done timeout!
Sep 25 07:51:39 machine_gun last message repeated 2 times
The log is now full with the same message, I cant understand the
eepro100.c code enough to find the problem.
Regards.
Gustavo
