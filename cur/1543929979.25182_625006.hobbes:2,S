There is only one problem I can see with this.  With network block
IO, some memory will be consumed upon IO completion.  We need to
make sure we reserve (number of in flight BIOs * maximum amount of
memory consumed upon IO completion) memory, in addition to the
memory you're accounting in your example above.
