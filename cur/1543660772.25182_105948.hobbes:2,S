   Yes, the problem persists.
   
   Interesting that it seems to happen on a variety of Ethernet cards,
   I wonder if the problem's in the TCP area.
I think the clue in this thread is the TCP_NODELAY socket option.
The one post claimed that by turning this on in telnet, it made
telnet exhibit the same problems SSH shows.
