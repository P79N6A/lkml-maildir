I have problems with this patch.
With
	generic-sys_rt_sigsuspend.patch
	handle-tif_restore_sigmask-for-frv.patch
	handle-tif_restore_sigmask-for-i386.patch
applied, or with all of David's patches applied, an FC5-test1 machine hangs
during the login process (local vt or sshd).  An FC1 machine doesn't
exhibit the problem.

(I retested with just current -linus and the above two patches.  Same
deal).
