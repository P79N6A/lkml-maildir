I just reconfigured my kernel to use the PAS-16 as a module.  Everything
works great.  Unloads, reloads...perfect.
To shift the topic a little bit.  I had also made a post about my keyboard
locking up if I ran gpm on my PS/2 mouse port (the Tyan S1590S
motherboard).  I can avoid the lockup if I have the mouse plugged in when
I power up the machine.  Plugging it in and just rebooting wasn't enough.
Last...
After all the talk of the wonderful ISA-PnP stuff made me try my USR modem
in PnP mode.  The isapnp driver found it, but the serial driver didn't
pick it up.  Am I missing something?  At work my Sound Blaster Vibra 16
just worked magicly when I configured in ISA-PnP and the sb driver.
