This is a case where fewer locks are better.
My main patch feedback here would be that it should merge
most of the usbfs patch I sent (second URL below).  There's
a driver model locking requirement that you didn't know about,
it needs to bubble up (subsys.rwsem writelock must be held if
you're going to change driver bindings).  And there were a
few other rough spots, which I think you've mentioned (and
I don't think they were new issues).
The more I think about it, the more I like your idea of
changing device->serialize to be an rwsem.  Changing config,
or resetting the device, would get the writelock.  All other
uses should share, with readlocks -- that's the right model.
Likely not before 2.6.1 though ... ;)
