sg_init_table() and sg_init_one() have an sg_mark_end() inside them, so
the scatterlists are terminated at their last entry.
In the only case where the scatterlist has a single entry, we use
sg_init_one(), which is terminated correctly.
In all other cases, we use skb_to_sgvec(), which calls sg_mark_end().
In other words, they're all magically terminated at the right place. I
didn't even think about it until you mentioned it, but I just verified
that in every case, they get terminated correctly. So the patch is ok
as-is.
The only reason they can't be terminated early is that the for_each_sg()
loop in arch/x86/kernel/pci-nommu.c nommu_map_sg() gets a null pointer
for s, and then we oops. It doesn't check that the scatterlist ended
early. I'd argue that it is the definition of for_each_sg() that is
wrong, because it doesn't check for sg == NULL, which sg_next() returns
when you reach the end of the chain. I don't want to be changing core
kernel code, though.

I didn't want to change the API. I'm comfortable with how virtio_net
works, but I haven't even tried to understand virtio_console or
virtio_blk yet.
The main problem I've run into is that the scatterlists are allocated on
the stack. Since I'm trying to do DMA transfers, I run dma_map_sg() on
them in add_buf(), and then I need to run dma_unmap_sg() on them in
get_buf(), after the DMA has completed. I've resorted to making copies
of the scatterlists.
Also, I have no idea how get()/set(), get_status()/set_status(), and
get_features()/finalize_features() are supposed to work. I'm going to
try and hook up two instances of virtio_net in memory, and see if I can
get them to communicate. Any pointers on that? :)

Maybe later. I need to get something working first.
Thanks for the input.
