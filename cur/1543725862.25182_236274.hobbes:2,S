Please don't resort to personal defamations. 
To summarize for an innocent bystander:
- The attacks you brought forward are in the best case a starting point
for known plain text attacks. Even DES is secure against this attack,
since an attacker would need 2^47 chosen plain texts to break the cipher
via differential cryptanalysis. (Table 12.14 Applied Cryptography,
Schneier). First, the watermark attack can only distinguish 32
watermarks. Second, you'd need a ~2.000.000 GB to store 2^47 chosen
plain texts. Third, I'm talking about DES (designed 1977!), no chance
against AES.
- The weaknesses brought forward by me are summarized  at

 . Thanks goes to
Pascal Brisset, who pointed out that cryptoloop is actually more secure
than I assumed.
If you, Jari, have any arguments left, it's time to state them now.
Otherwise, have a nice day,
