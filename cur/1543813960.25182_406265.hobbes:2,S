Hi Zach,
Can you please post the Xen compatibility layer (even if it is for 
2.0.x).  I think it's important to see that code to understand the 
advantages/disadvantages compared to the existing Xen paravirtualization 
interface.  Likewise, any Xen performance data would be useful as there 
has been some discussion about whether VMI would negatively impact Xen 
performance[1].
Thanks,
Anthony Liguori
