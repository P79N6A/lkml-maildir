This of course implies that 'chattr +s' (or whatever it was) has to fail
if the link count isn't exactly one.  Also makes for lots of uglyiness
if it's a directory option - you then have to walk all the entries in the
directory and check *their* link counts.  Bad Juju doing it in the kernel
if you have a directory with a million entries - and racy as hell if you
do it in userspace.
