Right, being able to control this interactivity knob programmatically
seems like a useful thing. That way, the window manager can boost the
interactivity of the foreground window for example. It does seem that
figuring out that something is interactive in the scheduler is tough,
there is just not enough information, whereas a higher layer may know
this for a fact. I guess this reduces my argument to just keeping the 
interactivity setting separate from priority.
