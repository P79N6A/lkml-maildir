Good, I think we're converging.

I can't quite work out the sequence here.  That issue was fixed four
years ago in 2.4.10: I sent the patch which moved the flush_cache_page
in vmscan.c, incorporating one posted by NIIBE Yutaka and David Miller,
to get SH right.  Whereas PA-RISC's _PAGE_FLUSH got added a year later
in 2.4.20 and 2.5.45.
Ah, yes, it got switched around the wrong side again in 2.5, because
the pte_chains rmap (based on 2.4.9) propagated that error for a while.
Well, it's simply an error if flush_cache_page is called after clearing
the pte, and it now looks like _PAGE_FLUSH was the wrong fix.  It would
be a nice simplification if you can now get rid of _PAGE_FLUSH (but I
won't be sending patches to do that myself).

If the overhead of setting them up and flushing them out after is low,
then yes, using your own tmpalias area sounds much better than getting
involved in the vma_prio_tree stuff.  ARM would then be the only
architecture having to dabble in that.

Okay, just don't blame me if it's horribly wrong ;)
I've simply not wrapped my head around the races, and would
need a much better understanding of SMP on PA-RISC to do so.
Right, it looks like we agree that my patch is necessary and valid as is;
but that the further races which worried me are not an issue, because the
racer will have done the necessary flush_cache_page.  And two cleanups may
be done later: remove _PAGE_FLUSH, and use tmpalias instead of vma_prio_tree.
