I have a box running 2.2.5 compiled with egcs-1.1.2 and using the via-rhine
ethernet driver.  When looking at /proc/net/dev, I'm missing the number of bytes
recieved, all other fields seem to be showing up properly.  It's on a 100Base-T
network.
Here's the recieve side:
Inter-|   Receive                                                
 face |bytes    packets errs drop fifo frame compressed multicast
  eth0:       0  438310    0    0    0     0          0         0
Obviously, if it's receiving packets, it probably should've received some data
along with it. ;-)
Relevant section from dmesg:
via-rhine.c:v1.00 9/5/98  Written by Donald Becker
  
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/via-rhine.html
eth0: VIA VT3043 Rhine at 0xfc80, 00:40:33:5a:7b:88, IRQ 11.
eth0: MII PHY found at address 1, status 0x782d advertising 05e1 Link 40a1.
I'll refrain from posting my .config for now, hopefully someone else will
notice that their /proc/net/dev isn't recording properly also...
