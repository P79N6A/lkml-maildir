Looks like I'm back on this one because just sending the NETDEV_UP for
the secondaries didn't work if a primary other than the first one is
removed.  If you have anything that you need help testing/debugging,
I'm stuck with this until it is fixed.  I'd prefer not to duplicate
effort on this if you're close to a fix.  If not, then I'll try to
come up with something and toss it out for comment.
