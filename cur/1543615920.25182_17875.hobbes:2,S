Hi All,
This is my version of the combined APM patches;
	Change notification order so that user mode is notified
		before drivers of impending suspends.
	Move the idling back into the idle loop.
	A couple of small tidy ups.
See header comments for attributions.
This works for me (including as a module).
Please test and let me know - it seems to lower my power requirements
by about 10% on my Thinkpad (over stock 2.4.17).
