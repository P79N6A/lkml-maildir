Hm, so assuming I got the gitk invocation right.  (I basically just ran
gitk ^goodsha1 ^goodsha2 ...etc... badsha1 badsha2 ... fs/nfsd include/linux/nfsd net/sunrpc /include/linux/sunrpc),
nothing really obvious pops out from that list.  I think the only
nonobvious changes that touch code you're likely to be hitting are the
exportfs rewrite.
Have you checked that the filesystem itself is OK?  (If you 'ls
/path/to/exported/filesystem' on the server does that work?)
Anyway if you get the git-bisect results, that'll be very helpful.  Till
then, yeah, sysrq-T is probably still the first thing to try.
