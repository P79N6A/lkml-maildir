It refused to apply cleanly on a 2.6.22.14 + CFS v24, only one failure
occured.  So I resolved it manually and attached the resulting diff.
My tests with Galaxy 5.9 shows that it still does not work.  Although,
the error seems to have changed a bit (see attached dmesg)

Should this patch eventually be included in?
2.6.25                                                      ?
2.6.24                                                      ?
(-stable 2.6.23 & 2.6.22) || backport CFS v24 -> v25        ?
