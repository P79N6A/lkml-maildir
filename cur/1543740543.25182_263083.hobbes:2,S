So very certain you are...
...but in any case, that doesn't mean much to me.
I think it's perfectly reasonable for me to believe what SCO 
admits in court, rather than what SCO might have fooled you into 
believing (after all of a cursory inspection) or persuaded you 
to lie about.  And what SCO is lately forced to admit in court 
is that it has no evidence of copyright infringement in Linux.  
After over a year of claiming to have "mountains" of this 
evidence and after multiple court orders to disclose this 
evidence, the best SCO can cough up doesn't pass muster.  SCO's 
"smoking gun" samples were either nonprotectable or were cobbled 
together in a half-assed attempt at evidence doctoring.
Not to mention which, "non-literal coypright infringement" is an 
oxymoron in almost all federal circuits, so don't even go down 
that road.

So far I've seen no plausible evidence that we aren't already 
there.  The bare word of a company/CEO that's already been 
caught stretching the truth counts for pretty much nothing.
