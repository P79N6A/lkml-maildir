Martin,
arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:smp_tune_scheduling() says:
       if (!cpu_khz) {
                /*
                 * this basically disables processor-affinity
                 * scheduling on SMP without a TSC.
                 */
                cacheflush_time = 0;
                return;
If you boot with notsc, you won't have cache affinity on your machine.
Which means that the load_balancer eventually selects cache hot tasks
for stealing. The O(1) scheduler doesn't do that under normal conditions!
Of course I'll add something to my patch such that it doesn't crash
if cache_decay_ticks is unset. But you might be measuring wrong things
right now if you leave cache_decay_ticks=0 as then the cache-affinity
on NUMAQ is switched off with the vanilla O(1) and with Michael's patch.
I want to say: you cannot evaluate the impact of Michael's patches if
you don't fix that. This issue is independent of my patches.
Regards,
Erich
