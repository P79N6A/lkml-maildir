It would be helpful if we could have a brief description of the feature
which you're discussing here.  We discussed this a couple of months back,
but I've forgotten most of it and it was off-list I think.
Doing `grep uid fs/fuse/*.c' gets us to the implementation, yes?
Which parts are controversial?
How _should_ we implement unprivileged mounts, if not this way?
