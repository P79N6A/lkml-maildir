So ... how can a revoke system call be implemented without changing vfs
too much?  IMHO this system call is missed.  There are some really interesting
interfaces using block or character devices which shouldn't be usable for users
because of the lack of secure revoking of such a device.  Therefore we `disable'
such devices by allowing only root access because chmod/chown is not secure.
On the other hand we say our users: Please do not work as root due to the risks ...
