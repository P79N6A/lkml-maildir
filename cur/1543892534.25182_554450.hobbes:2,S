Er, make that objcopy, not objdump.
Sane, maybe not.  Something people want to do (and under the mistaken 
assumption I know more about initramfs then they do, have asked me how), yes.  
It always boils down to "do you have a vmlinux image lying around?  Doing 
this with a bzImage _is_ brain surgery", and has yet to get beyond that 
question.  I had about half of a script worked out for this, once...
You can also supply an external initramfs image through the initrd mechanism, 
but this is unpleasant to do with some bootloaders (or lack of bootloaders).  
Plus it doesn't remove the old one, and wasting space makes embedded 
developers itch.
