Andre:
Is that to say that I'd experience this problem with any EIDE CDRW used on one
of the HPT366 channels, or is it to say that only several CDRWs aren't
supported under this chipset?
Also, in regards to Kurt, I wasn't running the CDRW on the same channel as the
source.
Intel PIIX4		HPT366
-----------		------
/dev/hda (CDRW, worked)	/dev/hde (boot: 36.5G)
/dev/hdb		/dev/hdf (storage: 61.4G)
/dev/hdc		/dev/hdg (CDRW, failed)
/dev/hdd		/dev/hdh
In the crashing setup, the boot drive was /dev/hde, source drive was /dev/hdf.
CDRW was /dev/hdg (Second channel, master.)  In the working setup, boot and
source were the same, CDRW was moved to hda.
Regards,
Damacus Porteng
