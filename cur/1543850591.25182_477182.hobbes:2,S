Subject: why "probe_kernel_address()", not "probe_user_address()"?

  it seems odd that the purpose of the "probe_kernel_address()" macro
is, in fact, to probe a *user* address (from linux/uaccess.h):
#define probe_kernel_address(addr, retval)              \
        ({                                              \
                long ret;                               \
                                                        \
                inc_preempt_count();                    \
                ret = __get_user(retval, addr);         \
                dec_preempt_count();                    \
                ret;                                    \
        })
  given that that routine is referenced only 5 places in the entire
source tree, wouldn't it be more meaningful to use a more appropriate
name?
pedantically yours,
