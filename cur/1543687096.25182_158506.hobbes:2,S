Subject: scheduler interactivity: timeslice calculation seem wrong

currently, nicer tasks (nice value toward -20) get larger timeslices,
and less nice tasks (nice value toward 19) get small timeslices.
this is contrary to all process scheduling theory i've read, and also
contrary to my intuition.
maybe it was done this way for fairness reasons, but that's another
story...
high priority (interactive) tasks should get small timeslices for best
interactive feeling, and low priority (cpu hog) tasks should get large
timeslices for best efficiency, anyway they can be preempted by higher
priority tasks if needed.
also, i think dynamic priority should be used for timeslice calculation
instead of static priority. the reason is, if a low priority task get a
priority boost (to prevent starvation, for example) it should use the
small timeslice corresponding to it's new priority level, instead of
using it's original large timeslice that can ruin the interactive feel.
something like this: (Sorry, not tested...)
PS: i've attached a small program to calculate and print the timeslices
length from code ripped from linux-2.6.0-test3
