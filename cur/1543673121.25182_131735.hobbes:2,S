You're right. The information provided by ATI is confusing.
It dosen't make much differece to me. By the time
a game or application capable of taking any benefits from agp8x
will be released R9k will be too poor to work with it anyway... ;)
Still I have enough of companies mixing my mind with
such statements as ATI (I'm not really into hardware
so together with my poor english results in such mistakes).
> btw. R9100 is both faster/cheaper than R9000PRO.
I bought my R9k at the end of 2002 when it's power/economy indicator
used to be much higher than today is.
