So internal to the kernel we have such a universal identifier.
struct user.
There are to practical questions.
1) How do we present that information to user space?
2) How does user space want to process this information?
If we only want user space to be able to look up a user and send
him a message.  It probably makes sense to do the struct user to
uid conversion in the proper context in the kernel because we have
that information.
If this is a general feature that happens to allows us to look up
the user given the filesystems view of what is going on would be
easier in the kernel, and not require translation.  But it means
that we can't support 9p and nfs for now.  But since we don't support
quotas on the client end anyway that doesn't sound like a big deal.
The problem with the filesystem view is that there will be occasions
where we simply can not map a user into it, because the filesystem
won't have a concept of that particular user.
So we could run into the situation where alice owns the file.  Bob
writes to the file and pushes it over quota.  But the filesystem
has no concept of who bob is.  So we won't be able to report that
it was bob that pushed things over the edge.

So the plan is to get to the point where are uid comparisons in the
kernel are (user namespace, uid) comparisons.  Or possibly struct
user comparisons (depending on the context.  And struct mount will
contain the user namespace of whoever mounted the filesystem.
Adding infrastructure to netlink to allow us to do conversions 
as the packets are enqueued for a specific user is something I
would rather avoid, but that is a path we can go down if we have
to.

A good question.  I think things are clear enough that it at least
makes sense to sketch a solution to the problem even if we don't
implement it at this point.
I have been hoping Cedric or Serge would jump in because I think those
are the guys who have been working on the implementation.
