Hello,
I'm asking this again, because last time (xmas time) I got no answer.
For me it looks like a SMP bug, but maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction...
--- original message ---
I have a problem with nfsd and kernel 2.2.13 SMP on Dual PIII450. Same kernel
without SMP compiled works without problems, but with SMP compiled the client
cannot create and write files. 
When I try to write into a file the nfs connection hangs and after a few seconds
the client logs something like this:
kernel: nfs: task 540 can't get a request slot
And then sometimes the server hangs without kmsgs or oops, reboot
is necessary.
# rpc.nfsd -v
Universal NFS Server 2.2beta38
Any idea what I can try to find out the problem ?
Armin
