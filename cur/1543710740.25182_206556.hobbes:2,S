Oh well, yes, the code has lots of bugs as it is currently in the tree, I have 
it rewritten in my net-experimental tree, that has lots of other changes 
(mostly renames, moving buttloads of stuff from net/ipv4 to net/core, etc) to
core code, tcp/ip v4/v6, sctp, etc, making most protocols use more and
more common infrastructure, its solid, but I don't have time right now to
work on chunk it to send to Dave, will do it, I hope, this month.
But hey, if you are really interested in llc2 let me know and I'll send you
my latest patches (IIRC they are at my 
www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/acme area).
FWIW I have patches for ncftp, vsftpd, openssh, etc making them use
PF_LLC, mostly transparent, just not for vsftpd, that reivents the
get{name,addr}info wheel for some reason 8)
