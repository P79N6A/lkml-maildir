Since -rt has been executing tasklets in process context for a long
time, I'm not sure this change would cause to many regressions. However,
it seems like implicit dependencies on "tasklets preempt everything"
might crop up. The other issue is if they don't "preempt
everything" (most of the time), what default priority do we give them
(all of the time)? It seems like Christoph's suggestion of converting
all the tasklets individually might be a better option, to deal with
specific pitfalls.
