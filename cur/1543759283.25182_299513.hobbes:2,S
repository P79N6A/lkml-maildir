Speaking of the cfq-timeslice scheduler, is there a version that
applies to recent -mm kernels ?
(I cannot find anything more recent than 2.6.10-rc3-mm1).
I'd really love to try it again as it made quite a noticeable
difference last time I've tried (but I can't live without reiser4 any
more...).
Best regards,
Vincent
