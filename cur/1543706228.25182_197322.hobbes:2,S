No problem.
The patch is against my 20031201 autofs4.
If you wish to test against a vanila kernel I'll need to revise it.
By the way, if you use the kernel module build kit you can 'make' the 
module, then 'make install', test and then 'make uninstall' to put the 
original module back. All you need is the source tree of the running 
kernel available (and macros set in Makefile.conf). I would need to make 
a different patch for this as well.
