Some tool kept warning about that.  Presumably then-current sparse.
I've certainly heard the conventional "unsigned long fits pointers"
wisdom, but tools disagreed.  (Does ANSI C guarantee that?  I'd think
not, or uintptr_t would not be needed.)
And ptrdiff_t was the closest relevant data type that passed both
gcc and sparse, since uintptr_t didn't previously exist everywhere.

Either access_ok() or copy_from_user() reports an error if the
pointer part of that u64 (N LSBs) is bad.
As a general policy, I think the other part is undefined and
irrelevant to the kernel ... it's a kind of explicit padding,
and padding isn't valdated.  (At most it's zeroed to prevent
a covert channel, but that's not relevent here.)
