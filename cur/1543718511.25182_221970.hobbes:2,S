Actually for every kobj_type structure, not for every kobject.  Doing a 
quick scan through the kernel I found 25 kobj_type decelerations so that 
would add up to 100 bytes only.  And that could be made a byte or flags 
field.
I wasn't sure if it was possible to create a subsystem that wasn't a 
part of the sysfs tree that contained kobjects that were.  Looking 
trough the code again it looks like it is so I'll use the hotplug filter 
as you suggest.
