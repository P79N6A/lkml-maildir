The BIOS may make assumptions we dont know about such as the bus layout. What
minimises the problem is effectively to validate the firmware provided PCI
setup and if its crap, then do the job ourselves. That minimizes the problems
Hence I think it should not be a define but an __init validator for the bus
setup
