By the way, I wonder if this problem is the same as
<
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5037>,
 about S3 hangs with
kernel pre-empts enabled.

I'll do that.  It's the one data point that I'm not sure about.  With
dummy _PSV, it hangs, though it takes a bit of stressing it before it
hangs.  But with dummy _PSV and dummy _AC0, I could not make it hang.
I tried it twice, each time stressing it as much as I could (about 10
or so cycles, with thermal polling thrown in as well as module loading
and unloading).  Even though it didn't hang, it did get *very*
sluggish at times, and once woke up with load=8.2 even though no
processes were running.  Lots of ACPI threads?
I'll test it just with sleep.sh, no thermal polling.  Maybe also with
loading and unloading thermal.ko.

This one I've tried, and it worked fine (no hang).  I tested it for a
while and then retested it.  It also works fine if I take out just the
EC0.UPDT line in _TMP (with AC0 already taken out).
