Until yesterday I also thought multiple read-only copies wouldn't do any
harm.  Well, until I learned about the wonderful behaviour of the PA8800
caches.  PA8800 has VIPT primary caches, PIPT secondary caches.  And the
sinister part - caches are exclusive, that is a cacheline is either in
L1 or L2 but never in both and can migrate between L1 and L2.  Now
onsider the following scenario:
 o physical address P is mapped to two aliasing addresses V1 and V2
 o a load from V1 results in a clean line in L1 caching P at index V1.
 o a store to V2 results in a clean line in L1 caching P at index V2.
 o the line at V2 is getting written back to memory.
 o a victim replacement of the line at V1 results in the _clean_ line
   migrating back from L1 to L2.
-> another read from V2 will return stale data.
As consequence flush_cache_mm() on PA (or at least PA8800) currently blows
away the entire cache, as Kyle McMartin just told me.  The whole 1.5MB L1
and 32MB of L2 making fork an ultraheavy operation.

The flush is there since a very long time.  I have it in my tree since
~ 2.1.36 and I get the feeling anybody every has been seriously revisited
the issue since.
