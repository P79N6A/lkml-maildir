I think this is a BAD idea.
I had a problem a while ago with an AIX machine.
1 the firewall died (power supply), middle of the day, time to scramble
2. remove the hard drive, mount it in another machine to read config files
3. AIX forced us to change the partition named from /, /usr, /home, etc to
/oldroot, /oldusr, /oldhome, etc
4. now that we had a new machine up and running we replaced the power
supply on the old machine and attempted to boot it, guess what, no /
partition to mount. According to IBM we needed to do a full re-install of
AIX.
don't do anything to a partition that makes it hard to mount it somewhere
else if you need to.

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
