It's not really documentation, it's code :)  If you want to build
documentation from the samples use kerneldoc or similar to extrace the
comments.  Having Documentation/ purely for things not affecting the build
make things a whole lot clearer, but if you absolutely insist on it
we can put it under Documentation/ as long as it's fully integrated into
kbuild and will be built as part of allmodconfig, unlike the current
two patches showing code there.
