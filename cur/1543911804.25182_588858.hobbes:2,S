In the second half of my previous reply (which seems to have been 
deleted), I suggest a way to avoid this problem without using hardware 
interrupt mitigation / coalescing. Original text is quoted below.

To implement this, there's no need for timers, hrtimers or generic NAPI 
support that others have suggested. A driver's poll() would set an 
internal flag and record the current jiffies value when finding 
workdone=0 rather than doing an immediate napi_complete(). Early in 
poll() it would test this flag and if set, do a low-cost test to see if 
it had any work to do. If no work, it would check the saved jiffies 
value and do the napi_complete() only if no work has been done for a 
configurable number of jiffies. This keeps interrupts disabled longer at 
the expense of many more calls to poll() where no work is done. So 
critical to this scheme is modifying the driver's poll() to fastpath the 
case of having no work to do while waiting for its local jiffy count to 
expire.
Here's an untested patch for tg3 that illustrates the idea.
