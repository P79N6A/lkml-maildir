Subject: [PATCH 3/3] rd: Simplify by using the same helper functions in libfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/21/603

While the ramdisk code in the page cache started with the ramfs
code it has diverged, and is a result is more complicated then
it currently needs to be.  This patch simplifies the ramfs
code by syncing it with ramfs and similar pieces of code.
The big difference is that the ramdisk must cope with people placing
buffer heads on it's pages so there is extra code required to mark
those buffer heads dirty and uptodate.
