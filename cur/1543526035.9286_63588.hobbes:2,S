no, I don't think so. Check section 8.10.3 which shows how to determine
the original signature and the update signature. The idea is to use 0x8B
MSR via rdmsr and after cpuid and compare the result. 
Besides one also has the signatures in processor entries of MP table. Do
they get updated as well? I haven't tried it yesterday. Will try
tonight.

Tigran.
