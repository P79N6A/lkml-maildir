I think I've found the special magic required to initialise my problem 
card without causing issues with other cards/controllers.
After the initial scan to determine a correct voltage, the host cycles 
power to reboot any cards (like mine) that have gone into shutdown. This 
patch works with the two cards I have (one good, one bad).
Russell, do you think this will work in all discussed scenarios?
