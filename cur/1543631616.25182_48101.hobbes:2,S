What, so there are _no_ patents or other restrictions on any of the
commercial embedded OS vendor products?  I would imagine that you need
to pay some sort of license fee to those vendors in order to use their
code for products you sell.
I imagine that the rtlinux patent is also available for license, and
will only have a small per-usage fee <= other commercial license fees.
If not then the patent holder is foolish and there is no point in having
the patent in the first place.
Cheers, Andreas
PS - I'm not in favour of patents for Linux at all, but saying "you
     can't use rtlinux because of the patent" doesn't make sense.
PPS- I also think "defensive patents" on Linux are also a bad idea,
     because (a) the Linux source code is surely "published" and any
     ideas therein already constitute prior art for the sake of
     defending a patent infringement suit, and (b) since patents can
     be bought and sold any "defensive patents" might fall into the
     wrong hands if the patent holder goes bankrupt and the assets are
     sold off to the highest bidder - bad news for the entire Linux
     community.
