Maybe you could convert that to sth. like this along the way?
int ret;
unsigned long timeout = jiffies + msec_to_jiffies(READ_TIMEOUT_MSECS);
for (;;) {
	ret = thinkpad_ec_lock();
	if (ret)
		return ret;
	ret = __hdaps_update(0);
	thinkpad_ec_unlock();
	if (ret != -EBUSY)
		return ret;
	if (time_after(timeout, jiffies))
		break;
	msleep(RETRY_MSECS);
}
return ret;
