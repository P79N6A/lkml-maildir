It looks like exactly the same issue.  When you set readahead
for the drive to 0 (to disable it), the only retry which is
done is the one by drive itself.  Linux return I/O error
to the application right when drive tells so, and it's up
to the application to descide what to do next - abort
(like `cp' does), or continue next (or next-to-next)
sector etc.  I don't know how to control retries in
the drive (if it's at all possible).
