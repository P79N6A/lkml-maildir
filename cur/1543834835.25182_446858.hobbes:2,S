You're again wrong generalizing. With KLive I can attempt to estimate
market share of _kernel_ code (what Hans did), but you can't attempt
to estimate market share of userland (what you did). It won't be a
smile at the end making your statement right.
The estimate market share of kernel code may not be accurate but it
has some minor significance.
