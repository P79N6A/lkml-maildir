one thing that seems to be clear to everyone except me is... what are the
semantics supposed to be?  [My understanding is that what is being discussed
is when you have an asm with a register as input and output, but with integer
types of different width for the input and output, but I saw some mention of
struct types in this thread...].  Presumably this is something obvious, but
it would be good to have someone spell it out in small words that even someone
like me can understand :)
Thanks,
Duncan.
