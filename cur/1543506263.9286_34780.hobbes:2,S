I just verified that I still have this problem with 2.2.12-final.
The symptom:
    sym53c8xx: 53c810a detected
    sym53c810a-0: rev=0x11, base=0xa000000, io_port=0x9800, irq=28
    sym53c810a-0: ID=7, Fast-IO, Parity Checking
    CACHE TEST FAILED: script exection failed
    start=80292d08, pc=80292d08, end=80292d28
    CACHE INCORRECTLY CONFIGURED
    sym53c810a-0: giving up...
My system:
    Alpha XLT-300 (Alcor)
    I boot with MILO in case it matters.
If I replace core_cia.c and core_cia.h with the one in 2.2.5, everything
works fine (as it has for years).
Alan Cox was under the impression that this had been fixed in 2.2.11 or
at least in 2.2.12, but in my case (cia) it hasn't (I've heard reports of
someone with a pyxis system where it _was_ in fact fixed).
I'm happy to test out any patches you may have for this (weekdays I'm
near my Alpha).
