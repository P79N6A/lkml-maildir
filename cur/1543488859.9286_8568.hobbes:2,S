That's what I did. Unfortunately the VESA standard modes use refresh rates
that suck (e.g. 800x600 at 56 Hz which is the lowest possible refresh for
800x600 modes). Is the VESA 2.0 BIOS at a fixed offset within the video
ROM space? I have one of those video cards which have a flashable BIOS,
and I was wondering if I could figure out where the mode timings are kept,
edit it with emacs, to get a higher refresh rate.
