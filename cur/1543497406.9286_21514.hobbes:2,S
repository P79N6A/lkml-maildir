The way to do this is called IrCOMM and is a serial port emulation protocol 
which makes it possible to use all your favorite serial port applications
over an IrDA link. This is the reason we can use pilot-xfer to sync the
Palm Pilot over IrDA even if the pilot-xfer program does not know anything
about IrDA links. It is possible to run PPP over IrCOMM.
Some people does not like the overhead of running PPP over IrCOMM, so they
have proposed a new standard called IrPPP. IrPPP basically just sends the
"raw" PPP frames (hopefully without any CRC) directly over the IrDA link
(IrTTP). Infrared access points are expected to support both IrLAN and
IrPPP in future. I haven't had time to implement IrPPP yet, but it should
be quite easy to fix.
PS. I haven't tried to run IrDA over IrCOMM yet ;-)
