Hi David.
This is a revision of my original proposal to take in information
since received, not a duplicate, but I've revised it to state what
appears to be the current requirements:
 1. The serial port will provide a flag field to indicate
    its state, with the following states being defined:
     a. NOT-HERE     - This port is not present. This is the
                       default state for all ports in the kernel
                       before any probes occur, and is the only
                       valid state for ports that are not found
                       to be present.
     b. FULL-DUPLEX  - This port is currently operating in full
                       duplex mode. This is the default state
                       for all ports for which the hardware has
                       been detected.
     c. FULL-TO-RX   - This port is in the process of switching
                       from full duplex mode to half duplex
                       receiving mode.
     d. RECEIVING    - This port is currently receiving data in
                       half duplex mode, so anything to transmit
                       is just queued until reception finishes.
     e. RX-TO-TX     - This port is in the process of switching
                       from reception to transmission of data in
                       half duplex mode.
                       This would only occur when the receiver
                       has been idle for a predefined length of
                       time AND the transmit buffer is not empty.
     f. TRANSMITTING - This port is currently transmitting data
                       in half duplex mode, so is not able to
                       receive anything.
     g. TX-TO-RX     - This port is in the process of switching
                       from transmission to reception of data in
                       half duplex mode.
     h. RX-TO-FULL   - This port is in the process of switching
                       from half duplex reception to full duplex
                       mode.
 2. The following hooks should be implemented:
     a. A routine to be called to say "Time sufficient for X
        bytes to be received has passed without reception of
        any bytes, and the port is in the RECEIVING mode" (as
        defined above). The default is for this routine to be
        called only if X (an unsigned quantity) is non-zero.
     b. A routine to be called to say "This port is in the
        TRANSMITTING mode and has run out of data to send".
     c. A routine to be called to switch the transmitter when
        any of the transitions (1.c), (1.e), (1.g) or (1.h)
        need to occur.
 3. The following additional IOCTL's should be implemented:
     a. One to specify the value of X as referred to in (2.a)
        above.
     b. One to specify that the port should switch to state
        Y (as defined in (1) above) now.
From an implementation viewpoint:
 2.a could be implemented along the lines of "On receipt of
     each byte, set a timeout to expire when the time needed
     for X bytes to be received has passed, resetting any
     such timeout that is currently in progress for this
     port. Should this timeout actually occur, call the
     specified routine."
 2.b would be implemented fairly easily, and the default
     response in the absence of any other would be to cause
     transition (1.g) to occur.
 2.c would be specific to the individual line disciplines.
Comments?
Best wishes from Riley.

    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
