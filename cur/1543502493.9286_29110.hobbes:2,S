If there is that much contention for the code then the resulting
cross-CPU communication will be at least as expensive as the lock
contention you were suffering in the first place!

Yes, some of the non-Intel Linux porting projects have tried using the
idle thread to pre-zero pages for get_free_page(), and have seen big
performance improvements as a result.

Ouch, I'd hate to see the CPU cost.  This is fine for a single-user box
with one swapping task, but gets really expensive as soon as you are
multitasking.

You cannot do this for the read() system call without playing really
expensive virtual memory tricks, but an alternative API for real
asynchronous IO is already being talked about.

No, VM tricks can be very expensive (especially with threaded programs
on SMP, where every VM update has to involve a cross-CPU interrupt to
invalidate TLB caches on other CPUs).  We actually tried this for pipes
once and it wasn't that good.

For every such definition you'll find a genuine program which triggers
the killer. :)

dmesg/syslog already offer this: you can specify messages to be of
debugging priority and only log higher priority messages to syslog.
"dmesg" will tell you all of the recent unlogged messages.

Ooh, like /proc fs?
