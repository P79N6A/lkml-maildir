Subject: NFS: support for 8k wsize in linux-2.2.0... [alpha-release patch available]

Hi,
  I've now got the beginnings of a patch for implementing clustering
of writes. In essence, I've adapted the code that was used by Olaf
Kirch in his (still) incomplete NFSV3-patch, and have added some hooks
that will be used to implement 8k reading once the writing is
reasonably stable...
  The patch should hopefully give a reasonable improvement in writing
speed against servers with support for 8k wsize and write gathering.
It should apply cleanly to stock linux-2.2.0-pre9, and can be picked
up from
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/nfsv2-wsize-0.3.dif
Enjoy,
  Trond
