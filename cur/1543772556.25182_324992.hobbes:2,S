Of course, if you target a buggy stack, you can expect anything.

In fact, I voluntarily did not speak about firewalls because almost all
of them are very sensible to TCP DoSes. First of all, all those which
don't check sequence numbers will blindly kill a session when they
receive an RST. And some of the other ones will not let certain ACK
packets pass through, which will make other DoS described in this
thread effective while it should not be, by not letting the server
tell the client to reset its session when really needed.

That's what I thought, too. I have another one for 2.4.31 which only adds
a CONFIG option to remove the associated code, which reduces the image by
400 bytes.
