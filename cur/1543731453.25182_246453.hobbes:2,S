Loading binary modules is considered OK in the kernel in case the binary
module was implemented independently of the kernel.
So if the same logic was applied to mplayer and win32 codecs, then that
would be considered OK.
What is not considered OK is to develop a module with the sole intent to
use it with the kernel and then distribute it as binary only. While we
kernel developers can't do much about it, at least we don't support it
by allowing specific hooks for that.
In the case of pwc+pwcx, pwcx (the decoder module) is completely useless
without pwc (the driver module), and thus is obviously falling in the
second class described above.
