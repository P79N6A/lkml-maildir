The cpu runs cool to the touch....infact this is the coolest this
computer has run in the past year. 2.3.99-pre3 was just to flakey on
this hardware but was the first dev kernel to recognize and use UDMA
on all three drives. Earlier kernels would use UDMA for the older
and smaller drives. I retreated back to 2.3.42.
