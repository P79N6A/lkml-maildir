INDEXF.SYS, on TOPS-10.

"Extents".  "Segments" were contiguous hunks of real memory that the MMU
knew about, then as now.
TOPS-20 used pagemaps.  A file on disk had a pagemap block filled with
special invalid PTEs which pointed to the data blocks.  To open a file,
locate its pagemap and page that in, then make references through it and
the pager will pull in the data for you and update the map page.  (This is
all separate from mapping a file over *process* virtual memory, but I seem
to recall that PMAP% borrowed a lot of code from the disk I/O subsystem in
this case.  It's been 20 years, though....)  TOPS-20 happily scattered
file blocks all over the volume-set if need be.

No, RAD50 and SIXBIT are different.  You can (de)compose SIXBIT words with
simple shift-and-mask operations, but RAD50 requires arithmetic.  (Hmmm,
on TOPS-10 we called it RADIX50, so maybe it's different.)
