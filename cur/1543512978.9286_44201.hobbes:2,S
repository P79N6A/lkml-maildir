I had the same problem with 2.3.21 (never tried .20), after reading
that it was a BIOS problem, I went on to the manufacturer's site
(Giga-Byte GA-6BXE MB), read the updates page which didn't mention the
problem amongst the things fixed, however the latest BIOS (Sept. 99)
fixed it. 
	It seems some manufacturers will fix things on the quiet, even though
they don't own up to it.
