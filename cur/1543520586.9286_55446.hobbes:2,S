You established that the PCI/DMA busmaster logics/BIOS on the GA-71X
aren't what they are supposed to be, working.

Patching a network driver that already has debugging switches to disable
DMA when your mainboard is most likely to be the cause of the problem
isn't the way to go here I'd say.

More reason to suspect the mainboard and not the cards.
