That spinlock _is_ platform data. We could define
struct pcspkr_platform_data {
        spinlock_t *lock;
};
and pass around this as the rest of platform code does but then we'd
need a header file and it would add a level of indirection but if you
like this better I can change it. Otherwise spinlock is another data
structure and we pass them around all teh time.

I am not sure where you see new data structure allocation... If you
look at your box you should see that /sys/bus/platform/devices/pcspkr
device is already there. We already create it so that pcspkr driver
can bind to it.

Yes, it probably is btetter.

By bad, sorry.
