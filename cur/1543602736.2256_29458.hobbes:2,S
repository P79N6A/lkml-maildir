We won't block on _ourselves_, but we can block on _two_ people doing it,
and blocking on each others requests that are blocked waiting on a bounce
buffer. Both will have one locked buffer, both will be waiting for the
other person unlocking that buffer, and neither will ever make progress.
You could clear that bit _after_ the bounce buffer allocation, I suspect.
But I also suspect that it doesn't matter much, and as I can imagine
similar problems with GFP_NOIO and loopback etc (do you see any reason why
loopback couldn't deadlock on waiting for itself?), I think the GFP_XXX
thing is the proper fix.
