Ok here goes. 
This is on 8way:
Test4:
Average throughput = 11145 messages per second
Test4-O18.1:
Average throughput = 9860 messages per second
Test3-mm3:
Average throughput = 9788 messages per second
So I grabbed test3-mm3 and started peeling back the patches
and found no change in throughput without _any_ of my Oxint patches applied, 
and just Ingo's A3 patch:
Test3-mm3-A3
Average throughput = 9889 messages per second
Then finally I removed that patch so there were no interactivity patches:
Test3-mm3-ni
Average throughput = 11052 messages per second
I performed each run 3 times and have the results and profiles posted here:

wli suggested inlining sched_clock from A3 to see if that helped but at 3am I 
think it can wait. At least I've been able to track down the drop. Thanks 
zwane for the iron access.
