We've implemented this "spread CQ callbacks across multiple CPUs"
functionality to get better throughput on a SMP system, as you have
seen.
Originaly, we had the same idea as you mentioned, that it would be better
to do this in the higher levels. The point is that we can't see so far
any simple posibility how this can done in the OpenIB stack, the TCP/IP
network layer or somewhere in the Linux kernel.
For example:
For IPoIB we get the best throughput when we do the CQ callbacks on
different CPUs and not to stay on the same CPU.
In other papers and slides (see [1]) you can see similar approaches.
I think such one implementation or functionality could require more
or less a non-trivial changes. This could be also releated to other
I/O traffic.
