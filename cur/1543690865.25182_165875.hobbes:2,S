	If the work would not have been restricted without it and is restricted
with it and you can't remove it, it's an additional restriction. If not,
what would an additional restriction be?

	The intent of the author has no bearing on whether or not a work is
derived.

	Show me where the GPL says you have to GPL derived works that you don't
distribute. That restriction is found nowhere in the GPL and if you
attempted to impose such a restriction, it would be an additional one.

	If it doesn't enforce anything and isn't a license restriction, then it's
perfectly legal and kosher to remove it.
