Hi,
Just a quick "comment in passing" to say that although I was pleased to
find out that the multi-initiator environment stuff works as expected
(between Linux and UnixWare), when booting Linux 2.2.5 (did not try
anything else - too busy at the moment) the partition table check fails on
any disks which were claimed by another OS. CD-ROMs however work fine and
I successfully mounted a CD-ROM physically in another machine (but same
SCSI bus).
Regards,
