Connector is not netlink API extension in any way.
It uses netlink as transport layer, one can change
cn_netlink_send()/cn_input() 
into something like bidirectional ioctl and use it.
Only one cn_netlink_send() function can be "described" as API
extension, 
although even it is not entirely true.
Better design explanation can be found in lkml/netdev archives.
