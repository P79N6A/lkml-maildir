I would rather expect flock to return with ERESTARTSYS and then for libc
to restart the syscall once the signal handler has finished executing.
A stint with the "strace" utility will show you that this is precisely
what happens.
As Dick and others already pointed out to you, the POSIX function
sigaction() allows you to disable the automatic restarting of the
syscall.
