Nothing in the logs prior to the first error message.
I've hit this before at different times on other servers.  If there are 
some commands I can run to gather more diagnostics on the problem, 
please let me know and I'll capture more information next time.
I see the error was reported with older 2.6 kernels and a patch was 
floating around.  I'm not sure if that is integrated into the current 
2.6.11 kernel.
