Hello,
	Does anyone know of a Linux equivalent to DoubleSpace or whatever that 
allows you read and _write_ to a compressed partiton or filesystem (in a way 
that is transparent to the progs using the fs). I know there was e2compr but 
that doesn't seem to have been touched in nearly 2 years, and is 2.2 
specific, Infotec and the CBD patch seem to have died and zlibc seems to be a 
read only solution. I'd have thought this would have been a biggie for 
embedded device people but there doesn't seem to be anything out there. 
	Any pointers greatfully received....
T.I.A.
Tim
