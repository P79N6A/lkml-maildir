Hello,
I would like to know whether (and how) the timestamp counters
of multiple CPUs in a multiprocessor machine are synchronized.
Can I rely on the fact that if I check the TSC value on
cpu 0 and then on cpu 1, then the second number will be 
larger than the first?
Do the counters drift or do they stay in synch once synchronized?
Thanks, -- Kris
