If I understand you correctly:
process 1         process 2
open(/dev/dsp)
modprobe->        
                  load module
                  init module   (can't remember which context, actually)
start writing     
                  set mixer levels
Is there any reason we ever want to unblock process 1 before process 2
terminates?
