Yes I have and agree it is not trivial.  What is required is
for the server's context in the process of servicing client A
to be saved with A and context of the new client to be loaded.
One way this can be accomplished is to save the server context
on the stack of the client which it is preempting.  This is
quite similar to the model of a CPU (server) and how task
(client) preemption is effected in the kernel.

In this scenario B is not preempting A's service, but rather elevating
S to the priority of B in hope S can compete for system resource at
B's priority.  In a preemptive scenario B would not sleep on S as its
priority would redirect S from A to B.  The only time an arriving high
priority client would promote/block over preemption would be if S
itself was blocked (unavailable).

Yes the above is just like a mutex.  However the model of a server
thread offers opportunity for greater server (resource) availability
while retaining correct semantics vs. that of a mutex (resource).
The server's service of a client in general may be preempted while
the ownership of a mutex may not.

True in the non-preemptive case as there is no reason to
notify S.  In the preemptive case S would receive the
equivalent of an interrupt upon B's arrival.

True.  However abstractly S would be preempted and save its
current context 'with' A.  S then would restore (load) B's
(initial) context and begin service.
A userspace example is probably not the easiest place to start.
Such saving and restoration of context is much less of a logistical
issue for in-kernel mechanisms.
Although I've implemented similar server models in userspace where
the available server interruptive mechanism boils down to sending
of a signal.  The enforcement of critical sections in the
server is effected by blocking signal delivery (preemption).

The server in the preemptive model virtualizes a CPU.  We can
preempt the service of the CPU during execution in a task (client)
by interrupting the CPU.  This results in saving of the CPU context
during the service of the client on the stack of the preempted client.

Yes, circular dependencies are illegal while strictly ordered
dependencies are allowable.  This is similar to enforcement of
a mutex/lock acquisition hierarchy.

Agreed.  And I do think this mechanism has merit irrespective
of the preemption model -- I wouldn't expect a preemptive
approach to be available in the first prototype.
I'd hazard other likely sources of battle history dealing with
client/server/preemption issues to be found in papers dealing with
microkernel [who?] design of about a decade and a half ago.
