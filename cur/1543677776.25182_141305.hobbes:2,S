My plan for 2.4.22 is:
 - Include the new aic7xxx driver.
 - Include ACPI. (I now realized its importance). Already discussing with
   Andrew the best way to do it.
 - Fix the latency/interactivity problems (Chris, Nick and Andrea working
on that)
 - Merge obviously correct -aa VM patches.
Those are the most important things that are needed now, I think.
