Well I can't find it there. I have a 2.5.65 tree and under character
devices I have
[ ] Non-standard serial port support
    Serial drivers --->
[ ] Unix98 PTY support
(2048) Maximum number of Unix98 PTYs in use (0-2048)
[ ] Parallel Printer support 
I see nothing for Virtual terminal in this sub-menu. Does this depend on
another option?
