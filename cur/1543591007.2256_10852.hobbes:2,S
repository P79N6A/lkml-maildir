Hi everyone,
Mark, I got your point about the dma/udma stuffs. My hdparm setting is UDMA w/ MultiSector 16..
I had recompiled my kernel and disabled the FB option but my linux box still hanged (another completely freeze) yesterday... Oh well..
I have been tracking this thread for a few days and it seem the source of this problem is related to swap space. Vincent, would you mind to send me the patch for swap space problem if Alan had sent it to you? So I can test it on my machine and report the result later.
Mark, please suggest a setting for the hdparm so I can test it on my machine. Thanks alot for your time.
Best Regards,
Jacky Liu
