Notice that in 2.5 (and that's backportable to 2.4 - I'll do that after
Oct 31) nfsservctl() is a trivial wrapper around open/write/read/close.
IOW, mountd and friends could stop using that syscall - all functionality
is available for userland without it.
See fs/nfsctl.c and fs/nfsd/nfsctl.c for example of doing that.
What things are done by afs_syscall()?  If you are passing some requests
to the afs driver - just tell what these requests are, writing that
stuff is a matter of an hour...
