Very good observation.  The code you illustrate is roughly what the 
patch mechanism used to do.  The disassembly serves one purpose, which 
is incomplete in our current implementation.  It provides live register 
information and constant propagation that can be used by an inliner in 
the VMI layer to inline hypervisor calls.  This information gets encoded 
naturally in the push sequence before the call instruction.
But considering it is currently incomplete, and most of the benefit can 
be had be special casing just 4 VMI calls to allow selective inlining, 
it does seem like a lot of complexity for little payoff.  I really don't 
like special casing, but in this scenario, it does seem to make sense.  
And of the 4 VMI calls, only one (SetInterruptMask) takes an input, and 
it takes that input in a fixed register.
Based on suggestions from Anthony Liguori and others, we are going to 
drop this extra complexity - we can get to hypervisor inlining later.  
Right now having the simplest and cleanest interface is more important.  
Actually, adding the required padding for inlining is quite easy:
#define FILL(n) ".fill " #n "-1,1,0x66; nop"
static inline void local_irq_restore(const unsigned long flags)
{
        vmi_wrap_call(
                SetInterruptMask, "pushl %0; popfl"  FILL(6),
                VMI_NO_OUTPUT,
                1, VMI_IREG1 (flags),
                XCONC("cc", "memory"));
}
Now you have 8 bytes to overwrite, which is sufficient for byte 
arithmetic operations to a memory address, plus a segment override.  
This seems like a much simpler solution than run-time disassembly.

This part was a joke  ;)
