This will be fixed in 0.7.3.

This is, in fact, supposed to be working.  I will test it thoroughly 
and fix it if it's broken.

Intentional, if the subordinate symbol is a boolean rather than a
trit-valued symbol.  There is discussion of the reasons for this in
the reference manual.

This is also intentional.  In general, when a symbol is changed,
the theorem prover in the runtime has to change all its prerequisites.
What behavior would you prefer?
