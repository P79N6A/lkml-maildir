Yeah , maybe I screwed something up. First time I've done a git bisect.

In this case I don't think anything was specifically turned on, beyond
SMP. For instance HRT/dynamic tick was off.
I didn't run "make oldconfig", but just running "make" asked for options
that just got added, which was nice.

I think if it's not that exact commit it's still one in that set. I
mainly wanted to confirm that it was an hrt/dynamic tick issue , and not
some left field patches..
