To do "fake" greyscale you would need to synchronize with the actual 
refresh of the controller or you will have very ugly aliasing artifacts.
Since there is no hardware interface to know when the controller is 
refreshing, I don't think this is one viable usage scenario.

It is not *that* bad. If nothing has changed, the driver only pays the 
cost of a 1024 bytes memcmp. Even more, there are no current users for 
anything other than a PC, so I think we shouldn't overdesign at this point.

That is not entirely true. If a user-space application misbehaves and 
starts writing faster than what can actually be seen, not having a fixed 
refresh rate means that your CPU will be *very* busy writing garbage 
that the user won't be able to see.
A fixed refresh rate is a maximum CPU usage tunable that prevents 
applications (that are not aware that this is an external slow device) 
to write more than what they should.
This can be improved, however.
We could have the concept of a "dirty" buffer. Any write or nopage call 
would set the dirty flag and set a timer to refresh the display in one 
refresh period from now.
When doing the actual refresh, the "dirty" flag would be cleared and the 
buffer unmapped.
In this case, if nothing was ever written to the display, the CPU usage 
would be _zero_ (as it should), and it would work nicely with dynticks 
and such.
Anyway, I think that the driver is useful as is and fulfills its 
original goals: drive an LCD connected to a parelel port on a PC.
Since the actual userspace interface supports the suggested 
improvements, we can just merge now and improve it later to support 
different usage scenarios as they appear (or even before they appear).
