in fact the way i implemented it in my tree:
#define in_atomic_rt()  (!oops_in_progress && (in_atomic() || irqs_disabled()))
still enables crash messages to make it to fbcon. So the only thing
skipped will be non-fatal messages printed from 'raw' critical sections.
(which are very rare in PREEMPT_RT kernels).
