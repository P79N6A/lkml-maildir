Currently what we have in the kernel is logical cpu hotplug, i.e once the
cpu is registered via register_cpu() that cpu can only go offline and still
the entry for that cpu will be present in the /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/online.
So __init register_cpu() is fine untill we support unregister_cpu()
which is required for physical cpu hotplug case.
I have submitted ACPI based physical cpu hotplug patches and waiting to here from
ACPI mainitainer Len Brown, there I have taken care to support unregister_cpu()
and register_cpu() is marked as __devinit in those patches.
