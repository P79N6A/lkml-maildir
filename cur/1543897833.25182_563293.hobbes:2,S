If can I join .. (again)
After upgrade to skype 1.4.x all sound output in skype I have only in left 
channel. Serching for skype+left+channel on google shows many people 
have this kind problem :>
ALSA does not privide application mixer settings on application level. 
Some messages on skype forums suggests some workarouds in ~/.asoudrc 
but where is documentation for this part ?
Anywhere are described ALSA diagnostics procedures/technics ?
