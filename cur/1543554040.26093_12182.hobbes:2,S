Hi,
The code which sets up the page table at pg0 (in head.S) goes all the way
until it hits empty_zero_page so I don't understand why we need the label
pg1 in between, since it is never referred to by any other code?
Also, is the comment in asm/pgtable.h
/* page table for 0-4MB for everybody */
extern unsigned long pg0[1024];
true or false? Isn't it for 0-8M as head.S claims?
Regards,
Tigran
