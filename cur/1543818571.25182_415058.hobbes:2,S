You're putting vlan stuff into a net/core/*.c file, that
is not correct.
If we're not going to do the ifdef mess, fudging around it
by putting a "VLAN" function into generic networking core
code isn't the way to try and deal with it.
Like I said, let's just leave things they way they are.
Every suggestion shown so far has been worse than what we
have now.
