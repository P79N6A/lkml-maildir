from my scan of the code, it appears to be safe ..

I am slightly uncomfortable with "not waiting for tasks inside the
kernel to get out" part, even if it that is done only for
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE tasks. For ex: consider this:
flush_workqueue() <- One of biggest offenders of lock_cpu_hotplug() to date
	for_each_online_cpu(cpu)
		flush_cpu_workqueue
			TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleep
If we don't wait for this thread from being frozen "voluntarily" (because it is 
in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleep), then flush_workqueue is clearly racy wrt
cpu hotplug.
I would imagine other situations like this are possible where "not waiting
for everyone to /voluntarily/ quiece" can break cpu hotplug. In fact,
the biggest reason why we are moving to freezer based hotplug is the
fact that it quiesces everyone, leading to (hopefully) zero race conditions.
