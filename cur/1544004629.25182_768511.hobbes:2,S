yes, but not reliably so - there's no guaranteed callgraph structure. 
With entry tracing we have entry+parent events, but especially across 
longer callchains there's no truly guaranteed way to preserve the full 
graph.

yes. The mockup output has place for that.

i suggested "full-function" tracer name before, but that sounds a bit 
quirky too.
Perhaps this should be the function-tracer, and the entry tracer would 
be the function-entry tracer?
