With the default split and kernel stack we can start up 94,000 threads on
x86. With Ben's/Dave's patch we can have up to 188,000 threads. With a 2:2
GB VM split configured we can start 376,000 threads. If someone's that
desperate then with a 1:3 split we can start up 564,000 threads.
Anton tested 1 million concurrent threads on one of his bigger PowerPC
boxes, which started up in around 30 seconds. I think he saw a load
average of around 200 thousand. [ie. the runqueue was probably a few
hundred thousand entries long at times.]

the extreme high-end of threading typically uses very controlled
applications and very small user level stacks.
as to the question of why so many threads, the answer is because we can :)
This, besides demonstrating some of the recent scalability advances, gives
us the warm fuzzy feeling that things are right in this area. I mean,
there are architectures where Linux could map a petabyte of RAM just fine,
even though that might not be something we desperately need today.
