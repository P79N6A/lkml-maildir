Hm.  Dumping oops information plus perhaps even a memory dump to a USB 
key sounds like it would be highly useful - lots of storage capacity, 
readily available, and can be plugged into just about any system.
I don't know if the backdoor debugging mode in EHCI can be used for 
that.  Either way, this would have to be done *very* carefully to avoid 
clobbering USB devices not intended for this purpose.
