-ac2 has rmap and lock-break is not designed for the rmap VM.  You can
just ignore the rejects.  Further, rmap has some conditional schedules
so you are taken care of.
If rmap finds its way into 2.5, I and others have some ideas about ways
to optimize the algorithms to reduce lock hold time and benefit from
preemption.  For example, Daniel Phillips has some ideas wrt
zap_page_range.
