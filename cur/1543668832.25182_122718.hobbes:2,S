Ok. Running -bk10. Where, umm, is the userspace interface to it? I can't
find anything in /proc or /sys so I can't see if it's actually working.
Incase they're useful here are snippets from .config and dmesg:

Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some
of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
