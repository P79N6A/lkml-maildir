Sorry, I didn't mean to be pushy. I understand that you have a lot on your
plate, and I'm sure you don't drop stuff. I just wasn't sure that you
noticed that that was a patch and not just a reply on this thread, since I
didn't flag it as such in the subject. I just didn't want it to slip under
the radar.

I thought you might have had something like that already, which was
another reason I thought you might have skipped this.

I wanted to keep the wait logic out when it wasn't a problem. Basically,
the problem only occurs when bit_spin_trylock is defined as an actual
trylock. So I put in a define there to enable the wait queues.  I didn't
want to waste cycles checking the wait queue in jbd_unlock_bh_state when
there would never be anything on it.  Heck, I figured why even have the
wait queue wasting memory if it wasn't needed.  So that added the
ifdeffery complexity.
