Ok, it doesn't sound like FIFO underrun, but FIFO overrun.  In theory,
this should never ever happen on the transmit side, however you appear
to be seeing exactly this.
The first thing I'll ask is that you check that the port is being
recognised as a ST16654 and not 16650V2.  The former has 64 bytes of
FIFO, the latter has 256 bytes.
Secondly, how many characters on average do you seem to be dropping in
one go?  I'm not expecting an exact figure, just a rough idea will
probably do.
Thirdly, there is a possibility here that could be causing this, and
it surrounds the following code in transmit_chars() in serial.c:
        count = info->xmit_fifo_size;
        do {
                serial_out(info, UART_TX, info->xmit.buf[info->xmit.tail]);
                info->xmit.tail = (info->xmit.tail + 1) & (SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE-1);
                info->state->icount.tx++;
                if (info->xmit.head == info->xmit.tail)
                        break;
        } while (--count > 0);
We always load a full FIFO-size chunk of data into the UART whenever
it says "hey, my transmit holding register is empty" since the FIFO
should be empty.  I'm wondering if the ST16654 is giving an early
indication.
Could you try changing the first line in drivers/char/serial.c to:
        count = info->xmit_fifo_size / 2;
to find out whether that improves the situation?  Don't worry, I don't
intend this as a fix.  Its more to (dis-)prove the point.
