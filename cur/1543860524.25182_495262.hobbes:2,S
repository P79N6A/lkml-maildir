Generally speaking, file system might have two different identifiers for
files:
 - one that makes it easy to tell whether two files are the same one;
 - one that makes it easy to locate file on the storage.
According to POSIX, inode number should always work as identifier of the
first class, but not necessary as one of the second. For example, in
reiserfs something called "a key" is used to locate on-disk inode, which
in turn, contains inode number. Identifiers of the second class tend to
live in directory entries, and during lookup we want to consult inode
cache _before_ reading inode from the disk (otherwise cache is mostly
useless), right? This means that some file systems want to index inodes
in a cache by something different than inode number.
There is another reason, why I, personally, would like to have an
ability to index inodes by things other than inode numbers: delayed
inode number allocation. Strictly speaking, file system has to assign
inode number to the file only when it is just about to report it to the
user space (either though stat, or, ugh... readdir). If location of
inode on disk depends on its inode number (like it is in inode-table
based file systems like ext[23]) then delayed inode number allocation
has to same advantages as delayed block allocation.
