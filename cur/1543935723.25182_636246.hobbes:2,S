Thank you!
A quick run-down for those who don't know what this is about:
Some applications use mmap() to modify files. Common examples are databases.
Linux does not update the mtime of files that are modified using mmap, even if
msync() is called.
This is very clearly against OpenGroup specifications.
This misfeatures causes such files to be silently *excluded* from normal backup
runs.
Solaris implements this properly.
NT has the same bug as Linux, using their private bastardisation of the mmap
interface - but since they don't care about SuS and are broken in so many other
ways, that really doesn't matter.
So, dear kernel developers, can we please integrate this patch to make Linux
stop silently excluding peoples databases from their backup?
