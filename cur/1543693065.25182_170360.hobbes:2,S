thanke a lot for reply Karim,
but I think that LTT does not fit to my needs. It needs to modify the
kernel - and that is what I want to avoid.
I'm looking for a already existing built-in capability.
Maybe signal SIGIO is a solution, if it  does not
(x) give me *every* IO event
(x) has to much overhead - I have to respond to keyboard/mouse events, *not*
     disk events
     grafic card events
     eth event
     etc. ...
