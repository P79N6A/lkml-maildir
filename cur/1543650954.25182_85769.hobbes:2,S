Note that this area has some extremely "interesting" properties. For one
you have to be very careful what operation you use to scrub and its
platform specific. On x86 for example you want to do something like lock
addl $0, mem. A simple read/write isnt safe because if the memory area
is a DMA target your read then write just corrupted data and made the
problem worse not better!
