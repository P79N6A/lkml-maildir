The host controller would tell the core to check for a card, exactly
like it does at all other times.
That's the natural alternative to having the MMC core assume that card
detection was broken in low power states, so that the core needed to
forcibly remove the cards before suspend, and reprobe during resume
processing.
Having the MMC core make such needless assumptions can cause problems
for the upper layers, including filesystems.
