So we agree that the shell behaviour is relevant for such scripts.
I don't think I missed a thing, and I think we are in agreement, except
on the relative value of this change, versus the risk of breaking a
shell.
If a shell is coded to allow for at most one option before the script
file path, and if a script is presented to it with a shebang option
having an embedded space, then ... oops.
You're just discounting the risk of either such scripts or of such
stupidly coded shells more than I am discounting such, and you are
valuing the usefulness of the proposed change more than I value it.
I accept that there is no shell, nor script, on your system that would
break, and to be honest, I can't find any such shell, or script, on my
system either.
