Please, not more layered config options! That just makes people who
want to enable the x440 or other alternative platform require fair
amounts of psychic power (maybe this can be fixed with a big fat help
message, but so can the current method).
If you're going hide the other options away so much, then the default
should be the generic arch, IMHO.
