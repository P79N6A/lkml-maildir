Well, the original intent was to separate the chip core logic from the actual 
board driver.  To that end, I needed two cores, one which was io mapped and 
one which was mem mapped.  In theory, set up the way it is, I can keep 
architectural dependencies out of the chip core (53c700.c).  The two file 
strategy was the only way I could think to do this.
lasi700 is completely parisc specific.  NCR_D700 is and x86 microchannel card.
Actually, the way you're suggesting will work with some modifications:  All I 
have to do in Config.in is require the lasi700 and the NCR_D700 to do a 
define_bool CONFIG_53C700_MEM_MAPPED y and define_bool CONFIG_53C700_IO_MAPPED 
y respectively when they're selected and insist that one or other of these 
flags be present in the core driver before it will compile.
I've got a big sync to do with the work I've been doing on the parisc driver, 
so I'll put that in too.
