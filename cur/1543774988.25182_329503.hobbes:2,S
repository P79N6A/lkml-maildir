Hello,
I'm running a 2.6.11 kernel.  I have 1 gig of RAM and 1 gig of swap.  Lately 
when my RAM gets full, the oom-killer takes out either Mozilla or 
Thunderbird (my two biggest memory hogs), even though my swap space is only 
20% full.  I still have ~800 MB of free swap space, so shouldn't the kernel 
push Moz or T-bird into swap instead of oom-killing it?  At their maximum 
memory-hogging capacity, neither Moz nor T-bird is ever using more than 200 MB.
Thanks,
Anthony DiSante
