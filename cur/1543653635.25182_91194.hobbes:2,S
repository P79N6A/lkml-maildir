This can be made clean if all the inlined C in the headers are pushed
back to an actual .c file and the make it function to call as an extern.
So the solution is to make a patch and publish that patch which cleans the
out the C code in question and move the associacted GPL license to the new
.c files.  This is proper and legal as structs are just the glue or api.
So if I publish this patch where it can be freely available for usage by
all, I comply with GPL.  This also removes any of the "extremists" points
of the smallest amount of GPL code invoked by the compiler can not touch
pure code.
Any arguments why this will not work?
