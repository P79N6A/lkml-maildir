Hello,
In the middle of playing this audio file I got this,
for the first time:
Playing MPEG stream from Fool's Garden - Lemon Tree.mp3 ...
MPEG 1.0 layer III, 128 kbit/s, 44100 Hz joint-stereo
Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?
But keeps on playing, nothing changed. Kernel is clean 2.2.0.
PII 233Mhz, 128MB ram, here's the sound initialization part:
<Sound Blaster 16 (4.13)> at 0x220 irq 5 dma 1,5
<Sound Blaster 16> at 0x330 irq 5 dma 0
Regards,
Murat Arslan
