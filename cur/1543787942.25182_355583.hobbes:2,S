*I am very sorry*.
At first I did not think this could be a problem of gentoo.
It just came up to my mind when I was writing this post.
That's why I added the lines refering 'gentoo'!
I should have looked at gentoo first ...
I'll be more carefull next time, if there is a next time :-(
Thank you anyway for your answer.
