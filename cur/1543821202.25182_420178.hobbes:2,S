Hi.
Sorry for the slow response - I only have internet access at work now. This is 
going to be a pattern for the next few weeks - I'm off work next week and.the 
week after I'll also be off apart from Monday and Tuesday (those are my last 
two days working for Cyclades - I then get my sweetheart and little one back, 
and we drive down to Victoria over the rest of the week).

Good point. Just because I've never seen it fail, doesn't mean it can't :)
Before I roll a new version, what did you think splitting the thawing and 
thawing bdevs in the middle? I think it's the right thing (TM) to do :>
