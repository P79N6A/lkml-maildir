Also there is a PCI-PCI bridge, I guess? ;-)

768Kb sounds strange. It must be power of 2. Perhaps it's 512Kb MMIO
and 256Kb ROM? But MMIO registers must be non-prefetchable. Weird.

No. For example, if you have 64Mb + 2x16Mb then 'min_align' will be 16Mb.

Yes, it's a trade-off - minimizing alignment vs. size requirements.
In most situations the former approach gives much better allocations.

Well, it works only because your 96Mb PCI aperture is aligned at 64Mb
(or more). If it was aligned at 32Mb, you wouldn't be able to allocate
prefetchable memory at all with your patch.
As a workaround, you can mark those additional 768Kb regions as
non-prefetchable and be done with it.
