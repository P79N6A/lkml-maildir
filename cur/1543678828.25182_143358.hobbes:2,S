I've had issues with 2.4.22-pre1 & 2.4.21-ac1 with PCMCIA & my orinoco
based wireless card (SMC 2632W) - as soon as I insert the card the
machine freezes.  Likewise with 2.4.21 normal. However 2.4.21-ac3 seems
to have fixed this.
Compiling with gcc 3.3; I thought this might be the problem and dropped
back to gcc 2.95, but 2.4.22-pre1 still hung.
Laptop is a Compaq N200; yenta CardBus driver compiled into the kernel.
pcmcia-cs 3.1.33; the machine will boot without the wireless card
inserted but hangs as soon as it is, or if inserted while booting hangs
when cardmgr starts.
