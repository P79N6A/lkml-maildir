Last time it was brought up was when TAKE5 of the patchset was posted
and I had planned to fix this in the TAKE6 - which didn't happen since
there was no final descision on the mode flags.
Anyhow, the x86_64 compat syscall has already been fixed in the ext4
patch queue.
I will repost all the patches rebased on 2.6.22 (as they are in the
ext4 patch queue), since these have already been dropped from -mm.

Ok. Will work on a small testcase and post it soon.
