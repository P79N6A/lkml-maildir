Hello!
    This changeset fixes reiserfs transactions replay code that sometimes
    may pick incorrect stuff to replay. Patch by Chris Mason.
    This changeset seems to be doomed. It was first submitted on April 17th, 2002.
    (and I thought it was accepted, anyway I cannot find another reason on why it
    was never resubmitted if it was not accepted. It was sent with some other changes,
    and some of those other changes are now in the tree which is even more strange).
    Anyway, here is this resurrected changeset, please pull from
    bk://namesys.com/bk/reiser3-linux-2.4-journal-replay-fix
