__bitwise__ - to be used for relatively compact stuff (gfp_t, etc.) that
is mostly warning-free and is supposed to stay that way.  Warnings will
be generated without __CHECK_ENDIAN__.
__bitwise - noisy stuff; in particular, __le*/__be* are that.  We really
don't want to drown in noise unless we'd explicitly asked for it.
