 I see. It's ashaming that the gcc people didn't care special casing
the quite common 64/32 case in the x86 machine description or at least
in libgcc.

 I agree. I'd prefer to see it fixed in gcc, but until then...

 A function which changes its semantics depending on the platform is
definitely a ugly hack.
 A cleaner way to address this problem would be using platform-specific
typedefs to reduce the size of specific objects to 32bits on smaller systems.
 In mm/vmscan.c:shrink_slab() you'll find this:
       long long delta;
       delta = scanned * shrinker->seeks;
       delta *= (*shrinker->shrinker)(0, gfp_mask);
       do_div(delta, pages + 1);
       shrinker->nr += delta;
 This is _BAD_ because delta will be 128bits on some 64bit systems
and 64bit, but truncated to 32bit in do_div(), on some other systems.
 Using at least uint64_t would solve the first problem, but anyone
looking at this code wouldn't realize the result could get truncated
by some do_div() implementations.
 What can we do about that? This time I don't have a clean solution to
advocate.
