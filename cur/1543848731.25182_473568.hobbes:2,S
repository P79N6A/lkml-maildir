Probably.  I need to get off butt and prepare rc2-mm1.
The below is the full patch against 2.6.19-rc2.  Please test this version.
From: Jeff Moyer <jmoyer@redhat.com>
When direct-io falls back to buffered write, it will just leave the dirty data
floating about in pagecache, pending regular writeback.
But normal direct-io semantics are that IO is synchronous, and that it leaves
no pagecache behind.
So change the fallback-to-buffered-write code to sync the file region and to
then strip away the pagecache, just as a regular direct-io write would do.
