Actually, some things (e.g. indirect block tree handling and directory
handling via pagecache) went the other way - from fs/sysv to fs/minix.

Yes and no - keep in mind that details of those lists are different for
various sysvfs flavours, so sysv_new_block() et.al. check sbi->s_type
anyway.  And the entry points into [ib]alloc are parallel, so it's not
hard to merge transparently for the rest of code.
Superblock layouts are very different, obviously, but they are just as
different among sysv flavours.  Again, no big deal...
 
BTW, there's a sysv flavour that uses bitmaps (EAFS); we only do it
read-only, so that's not an issue with the current fs/sysv code.
Again, what I'm saying is that figuring out details of doing it clean
way would make a good exercise, not that we can't live without that.
