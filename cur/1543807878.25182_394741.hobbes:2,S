I've done real studies on this. The majority of the kernel interfaces
favour simplicity and independance.

Most of our drivers are maintained by people with economic incentives to
maintain them. Economic incentives are not always cash and employment.

I'd beg to differ. The amount of hardware interfaces in a system that
are non standard has been dropping like a stone. Software is *expensive*
and it is getting cheaper and cheaper for commodity products to adopt a
commodity API, especially in the open source world where pure software
pricing scams (eg extra cost for flipping the 'raid enable' bit on a
controller) don't work.
The recent directions are pretty clear
	IDE -> Various interfaces -> AHCI
	A billion periphals -> USB (EHCI/OHCI/UHCI) + Class drivers
	SATA -> AHCI
	Sound -> Intel i810 clones/AC97
	USB imaging random drivers -> USB video classes
	Scanners -> USB video/image classes
	A billion camera interfaces -> USB storage
	A load of MP3 player interfaces -> USB storage
Its getting harder and harder to justify non-standard APIs except in a
few areas like infinibong and 3D graphics where they can make a product
genuinely better. Even RAID cards are drifting inexorably to either
extinction or emulating standard interfaces, and no doubt will
eventually end up AHCI.

But those people have a stable API - usually RHEL3, RHEL4, SuSE
Enterprise.

Time will tell. People said the same when Linux got so big it wouldn't
fit on one floppy disk. I can't prove you are wrong but my suspicion is
that economic incentives and pressures will mould the development
process over time according to the problems it faces.
