Not exactly the same. vmtruncate() doesn't alter the VMA list|AVL-tree, it
just eats the pages, so you get zeroes. mmap() from another thread,
though... We _could_ protect ourselves from that, all right
(down(&current->mm->mmap_sem) and we are OK).
The real problem is different - sure thing, you can get garbled dump if
you truncate one of the mmaped files, but you are virtually guaranteed to
get memory writes from another thread. IOW, it's a difference between "you
can shoot your foot if you want it" and "if you are really lucky you will
not suffer too long".
The question being: is it really worth the trouble? We could try to stop
all threads and get a relatively safe dumps, but that's way trickier than
"remove this silly check and grab ->mmap_sem to avoid oopsen". If somebody
is willing to do that right - sure, why not?
Stopping them all _will_ be tricky - e.g. file creation would better
happen before such attempt, etc. There is a nice deadlock potential, so
we'ld better be very accurate. We should be reasonably safe for a dump on
local fs if we grab the ->mmap_sem and allocate all blocks for dump before
stopping the rest of threads, but frankly, I've no idea what's involved in 
NFS and CODA cases.
