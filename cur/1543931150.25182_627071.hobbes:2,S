Okay, I'm going to ignore this one. This would be 4 microsecs but there are 
sleep states involved, and if a piece of hardware would work only when the 
system went to sleep I'd call it broken...

So this one will do I guess. The test program disables interrupts and as 
such, the cpu-hog shouldn't have interfered with the measurement. Thanks!
