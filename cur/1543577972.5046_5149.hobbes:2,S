Quoting from drivers/scsi/scsi.c:
	/*
	 * Usage: echo "scsi add-single-device 0 1 2 3" >/proc/scsi/scsi
	 * with  "0 1 2 3" replaced by your "Host Channel Id Lun".
	 * Consider this feature BETA.

so my take is unless you explicitly use hotplug devices (I wasn't), that it is
much safer to unload the driver, unattach/attach scsi devices, and then reload
the driver (which will scan the scsi bus for devices), which you need modules
for.
