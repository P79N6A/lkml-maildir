Ok, so I guess I should split the patch to truly ext3-specific part,
and the part that is common for all the filesystems. I guess I'll need
some help with everything but ext2 and ext3...

:-). Yes, that would help a bit.
(No, it is not complete solution. barrier=0/writeback on should be
still documented as unsafe).
