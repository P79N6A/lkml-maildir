No ICH ever had one.
The i810 era Intel RNG is in the FWH (the firmware hub, aka BIOS FLASH
chip).  You can have it anywhere someone uses an original Intel 82802AB or
82802AC FWH, no matter the chipset (the FWH is a LPC device).
But you have to be lucky enough to get a Intel FWH, and one that has the RNG
inside working.  I doubt Intel is producing them anymore, but you could ask
them.  The last board I know of that had those *if you were lucky* was the
D875PBZ.
