If I remember correctly, sync (at least in the past) schedules the
dumping of buffers to disk, but may return before everything is
actually written. Thus it was common in ages past to run  sync ; sync
; halt  when shutting down a system since even though the first sync
might return before writing was done, the second sync wouldn't start
before the first was really done, thus when the second sync returned
you'd know that at least the first one had completed.
I believe sync in recent Linux's actually waits for the data to be
written and never returns early, so I don't think this is relevant any
more - and everyone uses shutdown these days anyway. But go read the
implementation of sync if you really want to know.
