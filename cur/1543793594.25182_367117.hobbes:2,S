Dear all,
today, I tried linux-2.6.15-rc1 on my laptop (thinkpad t40p).
Before it had been running 2.6.14 without troubles.
What happened:
- compiled 2.6.15-rc1 with the 2.6.14 .config file.
- make install modules_install ; update-grub
- booted into 2.6.15-rc1
- started X.org (latest available in Debian unstable, DNR version)
- crashed the screen output -> rebooted
- booted in 2.6.14 (that run without problems)
- received the 'VFS ... cannot mount root ...' error message
  (ext2 and ext3 are statically compiled into the kernel)
- booted into Knoppix, fsck.ext3 didn't show any error
- retried 2.6.14 -- same error persists
- 2.6.15-rc1 boots still smoothly
- however, 2.6.15-rc1 has still no screen output after trying to
  start X.
---> how can I get back to 2.6.14 without loosing data
Any help is very welcome and urgently needed.
Thanks in advance,
wbr,
Lukas
