I don't think it'll make a blind bit of difference.  The oopses have
been known about (to me and others) since about October 2005...  Pavel
Machek was the first to report the hci_uart problems.
I diagnosed the uart_flush_buffer() oops being caused by hci_uart back
in October and where did that get us - nowhere at the time, but later
another bug report in bugzilla against serial and no progress.
Excuse me if I'm despondent on this issue - I'm personally looking for
a way out of being assigned blame for the crap known as hci_uart.
