I am tracking Peter's code in tip/core/locking:
 c10b491: mutex: implement adaptive spinning, v8
 c356a7c: mutex: implement adaptive spinning, v7
 b89e5d8: mutex: implement adaptive spinning, v6
 237ac94: mutex: implement adaptive spinning
And v8 is rock solid in all my testing - and i'll give v10 a similar 
workout as well.
Would you prefer a single commit or is this kind of delta development 
history useful, with all the variants (at least the later, more promising 
ones) included?
The commits are in a tight group with no merges inbetween.
