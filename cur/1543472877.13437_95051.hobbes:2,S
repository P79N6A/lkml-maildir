Of course you are correct about myself not using the proper protocol.
Sorry about that, i was not aware that this stuff was thought of as
being ready to use. So i simply waited for further information to come
along.

Right now i am using a Debian GNU/Linux system (slink aka frozen release):
client:/# uname -a
Linux baobab 2.1.131 #1 SMP Sat Dec 5 15:14:22 CET 1998 i686 unknown
client:/# mount -V
mount: mount-2.8a
Test case:
client:/# mount server:/export/volume1 /mnt
client:/# umount -f /mnt
umount: forced umount not supported yet
So it appears as if during the build i might have accidentally used
the 2.0 system headers which Debian provides as part of their libc6-dev
package...
I will rebuild the software from the latest sources and try again.
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
