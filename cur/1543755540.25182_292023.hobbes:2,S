Processor load we usually handle well, loaded disks are usually the
ones that cause >= 0.5 sec delays between bytes received by psmouse.
Please let me know if it still works with busy disks.

Well, we won't be able to do anythng about parity errors themselves
but hopefully the patch will make them almost invisible for you. I
wonder if the jump could be explained by having a byte with 2 bits
flipped. KBC then would not detect parity error and psmouse would
process the byte as if it was good. This should not be happening too
often.

Ok, I was wondering if you hit parity error twice in a row and it
decided to reconnect.
