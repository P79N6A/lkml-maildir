You missed the nice part about my vimrc patterns: :-D

They intentionally *don't* display whitespace at the end of the line  
to the left of your cursor.  I tried that one (that you quoted), but  
got annoyed by the fact that immediately after you typed any space or  
tab you had a little red blob to the left of the cursor.  So some of  
that "lagginess" is intentionaly (although not all of it, due to vim  
limitations).
