Something like it does.  Otherwise cdrecord (or any other sg user) has no
way to retrieve the max_sectors value for sg devices.

I have no idea, and I don't see why it is relevant.  (I don't even know 
what "SES" and "OSD" refer to.)

Maybe.  I wouldn't mind doing it that way.  But we would have to leave in 
the old ioctl, and we probably would still want it to be usable for sg 
devices.  Not to mention that it would be silly to have two ioctls which 
always return exactly the same values except for a factor of 512.

There should be one single ioctl which can be applied uniformly to all
CD-type devices (in fact, to all devices using a request_queue) to learn
max_sectors.  This rules out using SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE.
Furthermore, if you changed SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE in this way you would 
only increase the confusion.  The reserved size isn't directly related to 
the maximum allowed DMA length, and there's no point pretending it is.  
What if it turns out that the reserved size is smaller than max_sectors?  
Then you'd force user programs to do I/O in chunks that were smaller than 
necessary.

I don't know -- James will have to answer.  I don't see that it makes any 
real difference; the new code can easily be moved to the end.

Would the patch be okay with you if I rework it to put the new ioctls 
under the default case in sg?
