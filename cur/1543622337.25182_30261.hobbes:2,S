Subject: lockup on dual athlon system.

I can repeatedly lockup my TYAN 2460 motherboard with
dual athlon MP 1600s by running make -j 4 modules
(ie build linux)
I'm running the 2.4.18-rc1 kernel with SMP + Athlon optimizations.
sysreq will not print anything out when it locks, and I've seen
it lock both in the console and with X running.  I'm not sure
how to go about debugging this any farther, but will be happy
to run tests or gather information if anyone can suggest something...
Thanks,
Ben
