You find this surprising? I can't think of one succesful open project that
doesn't have a private list for core developers. IN fact, almost every
project that I have worked with, has some sort of closed email list where
core/central developers can convirge out of site and with less noise.
This gives the central developers a chance to speak uncluterred, to ppl
that have a serious and technical interest in the matters at hand.
