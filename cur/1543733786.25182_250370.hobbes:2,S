Have you asked Christoph if he thinks that patch is ready for
inclusion?  Its possibly just fallen through the cracks.

Yes please (it does help to actually contact the maintainers when
reporting bugs...).  It is not well known.

Hmm?  Which message was that?

It would be a good idea to track the memory statistics while you're
running your workloads to see where in particular the memory is being
used when you hit OOM - /proc/{meminfo,slabinfo,buddyinfo}.  I'd also
be interested to hear if that vfs_cache_pressure tweak that someone
recommended helps your load at all, thanks.
Is this xfsdump you're running for backups?

Yes, there's a group of people actively working on it.

But haven't figured out how to use it yet?

If you have trivial-to-trigger bugs (or other bugs) then please let
the folks at linux-xfs@oss.sgi.com know all the details (test cases,
etc, are quite useful).
cheers.
