This is not true.  Although there are some subtle issues, (which
I invite you to describe), the goal of the current design is to 
insure data integrity, and make sure that neither the driver nor 
the userland gets corrupted data. There shouldn't be any "crazy
or sudden death" if the device drivers are any good.
Of course, this depends on the hardware implementation. If
your PCI bus sends corrupt data up to the driver ... all bets 
are off. The design is predicated on the assumption that the
hardware sends either good data or no data, ad that the latter
is associated with a bus state indicating an error has ocurred.

I assume you meant "if arch chooses NOT to panic on bus errors ..."
I'll review the rest of the patch via sepaate email
