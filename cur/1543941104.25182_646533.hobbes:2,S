I thought about those patches when you reported your problem but they
looked correct at first glance, and generally Al is known for pushing
clean and valid work.

Yes it should be possible, people generally try to push incrementally
valid patches. Please CC Al with your findings. Maybe you'll get him
caught with a bug in his fixes, but get prepared to get fried on your
chair if you're wrong :-)
It is also possible that the code he fixed was really buggy but worked
because of another bug remaining somewhere else.
Regards,
Willy
