Well actually I came to the same conclusion regarding the dealing
with broken chipsets. However please note that:
1. queues are per device, since we have to deal with
the fact that the code flow can be different whatever:
1.1. The drive is doing DMA transfers.
1.2. The drive is doing TCQ. (could and should be unifyed with 1.1.)
1.3. The drive is doing ATAPI.
2. Operations are per channel and not per queue.
Therefore the queue locking and basic serialization
has to be on the channel level, with the "lock recycling trick"
for the two interface chips, which can't distingish properly
between primary and secondary channel.
OK?
