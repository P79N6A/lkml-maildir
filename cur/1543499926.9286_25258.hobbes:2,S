Do an ulimit -a to get a list of all limits. With ulimit -u you can
change the number of processes you can run. With a normal unix you
(a normal user) can only decrease that number (linux also allows
you to increase it again). Only root can increase it above a certain
value (set earlier by root).
Vague reply. Sorry about that.
