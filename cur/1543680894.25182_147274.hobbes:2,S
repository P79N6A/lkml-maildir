Deadlock is gone but problem is still there.
Running processes (state R) keep running smooth until they try to access
any resource (ie. xmms keeps playing the current file but gets stuck
when trying to open next one, top keeps running with full
interactivity). Spawning new processes is impossible.
I had top running over SSH and when I exited I managed to type 1 char
then it hung up. A note is that sometimes the load is ~45% user ~55%
system instead of ~55% user and ~45% system. There are always those
values.
I tried to reproduce by creating a while(1){} loop but it runs smooth.
Any suggestions on methods to debug this?
