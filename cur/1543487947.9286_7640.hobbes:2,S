Subject: Use of 'mtu' field in sk structure under 2.0.3x

I'm somewhat confused about the use of the mtu field in the sock
structure for TCP sockets under 2.0.36. Sometimes the code uses
sk->ip_route_cache->rt_mtu and sometimes it uses sk->mtu. The path
mtu discovery code tries to update both fields. 
sk->mtu seems to be set at 576 -- and comments in the code indicate
that changing sk->mtu after the start of a connection is *bad news*.
Can anybody explain when one field rather than the other should be
used?
[The reason for my interest is that I have path mtu discovery problems
with sockets that are bound to a particular interface]
