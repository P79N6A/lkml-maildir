Traditionally, Linux only supports async i/o with sockets and terminals.
You can use select on several handles to wait until pending input is
available on any of them (not exactly async); or you can use fcntl/sigio
and the kernel will tell you when input is available.
In the slashdot posting about the recent famous SPECWeb99 benchmarks
Ingo Molar said:
"Other 2.4 kernel advances TUX uses are: async networking and disk IO,"
Does this mean that the kernel 2.4 supports fcntl/sigio with regular
files? Or it supports select with them?
Thank you very much.
Ramon
