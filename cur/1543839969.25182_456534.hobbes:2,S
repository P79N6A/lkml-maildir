Ok, I just took a cold shower.  Actually, this problem is much easier to 
solve for paravirt-ops, since they are short lived operations and don't 
block.  For syscall, it is much, much harder, since you have syscalls 
that can block forever, so you can't guarantee you'll exit all instances 
of the syscall you want to patch.
I think the paravirt-ops one is doable with exports already provided by 
Linux.
