This is consistent with the lockup I reported several hours ago.
In the case of my "unstable" 2.4.0-test12 machine where "startx"
worked fine for "root" but not for a normal user, the "root"
account is local.  The normal user account home directories are
NFS mounted :-(.
Good spot!  I've done a little mucking around with the networking
code, i.e., no promises, but maybe I can come up with a fix.
