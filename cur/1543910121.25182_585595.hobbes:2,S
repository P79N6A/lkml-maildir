I think die_chain is arch independent definition (kernel/die_notifier.c)? 
But anyway, to begin with it can be done only for panic_notifier.

I think Bernhard's suggestion looks better here. I noticed that 
/sys/kernel/debug is already present. So how about following.
/sys/kernel/debug/kdump/priority
/sys/kernel/debug/kdb/priority
/sys/kernel/debug/IPMI/priority
I think at some point of time we shall have to create another file say
description.
/sys/kernel/debug/IPMI/description
Which can tell what does this tool do? Other a user might not have any
clue how to prioritize various things.
Thanks
Vivek
