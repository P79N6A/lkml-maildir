Hmm...  How would I go about adding support for these formats?  
If I'm reading right, there's one bit in the minor device number for the
controller, 2 bits for the drive, leaving 5 bits for the format.  And
there are 32 formats defined.  :(  What ought I to do?
And another thing: The 3b1 insists on preserving the first track on the
top of the disk for system stuff.  They have one device for the whole disk
and a second device for the useable data portion.  Seems like a waste.
Cheers,
