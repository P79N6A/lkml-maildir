Ok, I believe that now I see your point. You're right, to simplify if
your application reads an ELF file and begins to interpret that, Digsig
does not cover that case.  For me what you mention here rather concerns
the bahavior of the application, which is not what we intend to
implement here. Digsig functionality is limited to checking the validity
of the signature of your binary when Linux loads it. And, IMO, it should
be used with other security mechanisms and not alone. I believe though
this simple functionality can do much to avoid executing viruses or
other malware on your system.
