You could of course also backport the current 2.5 kallsyms code. This has,
though originally based on kallsyms, been completely rewritten and not
much to do with the original patch anymore (and different objectives).
It generates the information as a .S file and uses the cross-assembler to
generate the object code, so it does not have any of the above issues.
