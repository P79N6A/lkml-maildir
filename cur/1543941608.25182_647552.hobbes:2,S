Here are incremental patches against the "export BDI attributes in
sysfs" patchset, addressing the issues identified at the last
submission:
  - the read-only attributes are only for debugging
  - more consistent naming needed in /sys/class/bdi
  - documentation problems
I've also done some testing, and fixed some bugs.  Including patches
in -mm can do wonders, even before the kernel containing them is
released :)
Let me know if you prefer a resubmission of the original series with
these changes folded in.
Thanks,
Miklos
