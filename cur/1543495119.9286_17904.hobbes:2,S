Well, my solution is to put 10sec pause after oops - so that you can
copy it by hand :-).
If that is not enough, you can go for Nowell-like solution:
Kernel oopsed, please insert blank formatted floppy and press Magic-d
(then 60 seconds pause and then system tries to contiue or tries to reboot)
:-) But serial line works much better.
It is bad idea to write post-oops dump onto hdd, but writting onto fdd
is not _that_ risky.
