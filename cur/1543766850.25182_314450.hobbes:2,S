hello,
I have a doubt regarding user space threads and device drivers
implementation issue.
I have a device driver for /dev/skn
It implements basic driver operations skn_open,skn_release, skn_ioctl.
I am storing something into struct file*filp->private_data.
As this is not shared across processes I am not doing any locking
stuff while accessing or putting anything into it.
Will There be a race condition in a multithreaded program in the ioctl
call on smp kernel accessing filp->private_data.
