Either changing the linker and telling everybody to upgrade 
or writing a mini linker that works at kernel boot time.
Upgrading binutils is imho not acceptable and doing
the runtime relocation would be a lot of code for 
questionable gain.

The segment register needs an offset. So you need the linker to generate
the offset from the base of the per cpu segment somehow. At compile time the 
address is not known so it cannot be done then.
To work around this we do it at runtime.
User space TLS has some specialized relocations for this, but they
are so hack^wspecialized that they are not usable for the kernel.
