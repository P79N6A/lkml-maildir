Well, how much do you need rid of?  All the local apic stuff can move
into apic.c as something like x86_percpu_apic_setup(cpu) for the in loop
stuff and x86_percpu_apic_global() for the rest ... these then become
weak empty functions in setup_percpu.c.  That elimiates the alleged
voyager problem.
The other cases are nastier:  there's a numa case, an x86_84 case and a
both numa and x86_64 case.  We only have files for the x86_64 case.  At
a stretch the numa cases could move into mm/numa_${BITS}.c
This isn't really hugely critical path so this type of approach would
work ... I can cook up a patch if it's acceptable?
