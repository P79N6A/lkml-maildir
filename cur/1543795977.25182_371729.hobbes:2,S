Hi,
Is there a effort/patches underway to provide better pagecache
statistics ? 
Basically, I am interested in finding detailed break out of
cached pages. ("Cached" in /proc/meminfo) 
Out of this "cached pages"
- How much is just file system cache (regular file data) ?
- How much is shared memory pages ?
- How much is mmaped() stuff ?
- How much is for text, data, bss, heap, malloc ?
What is the right way of getting this kind of data ? 
I was trying to add tags when we do add_to_page_cache()
and quickly got ugly :(
Thanks,
Badari
