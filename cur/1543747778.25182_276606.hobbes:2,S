No, it doesn't. I was unfortunately much too focused on the loop0-loop0 problem to realize those issues.

Andries' patch addresses all issues Chris and I encountered although raising some minor problems.
In the while-loop only the inodes are being compared. But you can have more than one device node pointing to this specific device. Consequently, we need to compare the dev_t structures like in my initial patch.
Moreover, if the loopback device l is unbound, the while-loop shouldn't be terminated as this (unbound!) device file would therefore be set as the new backing file, which makes no sense in my opinion and which additionally could lead into problems while accessing the device. I would propose a goto out_putf to return -EINVAL instead.
Now, Chris' and my issues with mount and losetup are resolved properly. I attached the patch of Andries including the proposed changes.
