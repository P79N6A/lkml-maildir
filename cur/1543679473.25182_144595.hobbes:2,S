This is why all my clients get HP 7504a tape drives in their tape servers.
40/80GB tape that can do disaster recovery is a GOOD thing!  :-)

Boy you do need a good admin :)  Done correctly, tapes are quite
practical for that amount of data.  A LTO or SDLT drive would back the
entire 45GB thing up on a single tape, with room for at least one to two
more full backups.  Granted, you're not going to have tape act as your
hot backup, but it is a good third line of defense.  Plus data backed up
to tape is immune from human or software error that may otherwise affect
the hard-drive based data.
45GB of code is very compressible and I'm sure good chunks of that don't
change on a weekly basis.  I'd imagine you could get a weekly or
bi-weekly full backup to tape in the span of about two hours, and then
do nightly differentials which would probably be only 15 minutes in
length.  A filesystem capable of doing snapshots would ensure
consistency of the repositories on tape and would prevent you from
having to shutdown bkbits while backing up.
