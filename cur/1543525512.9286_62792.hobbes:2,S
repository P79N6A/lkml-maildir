Sounds to me like you two are saying the same thing essentially... If the 
X server (or svgalib or GGI library) is made multihead-aware, that means
all your X (or svgalib or GGI) apps can be happily spread across all the
monitors in your room if you like without changing a line of the
applications' code.
Right now I'm running XFree86 3.9 in Xinerama mode over two monitors as a
single unified virtual screen - Xterm and Gimp doen't know that, nor do
they need to. X does, so it handles the multihead for them. If the console
system changes a bit to add better support for multihead, just update X to
grok the new system.
Huge, multi-screen text consoles might be nice too (right now I'm stuck
on one monitor with VesaFB for text, should've bought Matrox), but could
again be handled in userspace with something along the lines of 'screen'
as long as the kernel can handle each console individually, without any
specific multihead support built into vi or emacs - though someone will
add it to Emacs I'm sure...
Of course any app that needs or wants specific control over how to use
multihead should be able to get it... Say, an image or video viewer which
displays files on the second monitor while keeping controls and thumbnail
lists on the first. Or a 3d game which uses three monitors to show you
side views to your left and right as well as straight ahead (the original
version of Doom could do this by using three networked hosts).
But the general-purpose usage of multihead is going to be either:
A) Separately controllable heads, with apps on each head not needing to
   know or care about the other heads
or
B) Multiple monitors combined into a virtual large screen - can be done by
   an appropriately knowledgable intermediary layer without specific apps
   running under them needing to know or care about the multihead
   situation
I certainly don't think that combining consoles together should be a job
for the kernel... But it might be nice to be able to assign which console
pieces (screens, keyboards, maybe mice) a virtual console uses so that
complementary VCs (leftmost screen & PS/2 keyb/mouse vs rightmost screen
& USB keyb/mouse) can coexist happily but switching to my dual-head X VC
(both monitors, combine input from both PS/2 and USB) is sure to make BOTH
text consoles go away properly WITHOUT interfering with my potential third
console with yet-another-USB keyboard on the TV-out strung across the 
room. Or am I being incoherent at... 6 am? (Ack! time to go to sleep...
too much linux-kernel...) Well it makes perfect sense to me right now...
