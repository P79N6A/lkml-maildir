NAK.
This is wrong for two reasons:
- MSRs are not accessible in user space.
- .section .fixup is not applicable to user space.
Anything MSR-related should be protected by __KERNEL__ instead.
This NAK doesn't apply to rdtsc* and rdpmc* changes, however, as those
instructions are legitimate in userspace.
