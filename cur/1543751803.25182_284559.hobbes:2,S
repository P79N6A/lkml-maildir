Seems the best of all 2.4.# kernels, congrats!
On 7 machines works perfectly,
and on our production,
SMP dual Xeon-2800HT it seems to be a bit faster.
On each machine different NIC's (eth 100Mbits/s),
doing backups every 20 minutes/etc., all 100% perfect.
Not in LKML, cc if you need/want.
Sincere congrats to Marcelo and to all the programmers.

PS Using Schilling's cdrtools, with his SCSI problems,
   I don't think to switch to 2.6.# kernels,
   all works perfectly now, time is money,
   and I have _ZERO_ time to experiment.
