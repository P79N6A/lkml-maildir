I can assure you that serio_raw driver _does not_ use input system - it is
implementation of pre 2.6 /dev/psaux interface giving you access to raw AUX
data. It was written so we can still use PS/2 devices for which we don't have
proper in-kernel driver but have working userspace solution. It completely
bypasses input layer.
