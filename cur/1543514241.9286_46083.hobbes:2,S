Hi Matt.
I´ve seen this problem on many other ASUS mainboards, but not with Linux.
I am using an ASUS P5A and the problem occurs every time I soft-reboot Win98.
I thought that it has to do something with my AUDIOWERK 8 recording
card which (maybe) does something odd with the bios reboot code, but I am not
sure. I often have to reboot the machine with the reset switch. This is very
annoying,
because I have a raid controller which flushes the cache while rebooting and
this does sometimes lead to data loss.
Did you try to remove unnecessary cards to find the problem? The newest
bios update for P5A did not fix the problem but didn´t introduce new bugs
either.
Did you try to compe a newer kernel to fix the oops?
Bye,
 Levent.
