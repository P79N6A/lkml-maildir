Yep, that's why I wrote about something that affected XFS - at first I
thought it might have been preemption but then I checked I had it on also on
2.5.55. I'm running 2.5.58 currently and should the oops happen again, I'll
either transcribe the screen or get a screenshot via serial console. The
only thing I added in my > .55 config was the freebsd slice support and the
UFS support (as the module), but I doubt that would be the cause, although,
who knows?
