( this misunderstanding of yours has been cleared up in a later mail: 
  reading a counter causes events in the monitoring context, not in the
  monitored context. )

We have looked, and the PAPI library can be implemented on top of our 
system call as well - just like it was implemented on top of the perfctr 
driver and like it was implemented ontop of "perfmon-full".
PAPI is a relatively simple wrapper around OS level performance counter 
facilities. Both the high level counter abstraction 
(PAPI_start_counters() & friends) and the low level PAPI abstraction 
(PAPI event sets, PAPI_attach/detach) can be readily implemented via the 
use of our performance counter subsystem facilities. (In addition to all 
the facilities around PAPI event enumeration.)
PAPI has about 100 functions - if you think our design does not fit it 
for some fundamental reason then please point out exactly which 
functionality (which PAPI function call) cannot be done.
Perfmon needlessly complicated their design by exposing user-space to a 
'performance counter context' and other lowlevel details that should not 
and must not be handled at the ABI level. The PAPI interfaces do not 
force that design choice in any way. It's a plain unnecessary 
complication that permeates the whole perfmon code.
