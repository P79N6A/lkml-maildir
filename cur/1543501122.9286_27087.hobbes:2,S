Letting the user mess around with the internals of a directory-based
albod is a *feature*. I will refuse to use a system that bars me from
doing that. Barring access to the individual "data forks" is a
restriction in flexibility. The lowest levels must present the data
forks as files.
In the GUI, however, you can pretend the albod is atomic (although,
again, it would be wise to provide an option to "break" the albod).

The normal user will be using a GUI, and thus will see the albod as an
atomic piece of data.

The contents of the directory are not of interest to regular lusers
who can only use the GUI. Power users will definately want to get in
under the hood.
