   I want to suggest to the listserver admin (again) that this list and others
   on vger.kernel.org be restricted so that you can only post to the list if
   you are a member.
Absolutely not and this has been discussed a thousand times
and nothing has changes wrt. the reasons we have for making
this decision.
