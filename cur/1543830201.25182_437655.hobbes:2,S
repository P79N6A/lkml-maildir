Subject: [Suspend2][ 08/13] [Suspend2] Userspace is ready!
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Routine called when we are waiting for a userspace helper to start, and
receive a netlink message from it, saying it's ready to go. We check the
version for compatability, and if all looks good, call the completion
handler on the waiting code. If not, we complain bitterly and try to
continue without it.
