Hi,
I've got this Asus A7V8X motherboard that contains a promise 20376
sata-ide (raid) controller. In the latest kernel sources (2.4 and 2.5) 
I don't see any mention of this chip yet. Also a google search does
not reveal much about linux support. 
Is there already any work in progress for it?
-Marcel
