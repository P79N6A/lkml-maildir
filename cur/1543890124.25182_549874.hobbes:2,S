Sounds good to me, but how do we test to see if the underlying
device supports barriers? Do we just assume that they do and
only change behaviour if -o nobarrier is specified in the mount
options?

The use of barriers in XFS assumes the commit write to be on stable
storage before it returns.  One of the ordering guarantees that we
need is that the transaction (commit write) is on disk before the
metadata block containing the change in the transaction is written
to disk and the current barrier behaviour gives us that.

No, that breaks the above usage of a barrier....

No, not enough for XFS.

And that assumes the filesystem is tracking exact dependencies
between I/Os.  Such a mechanism would probably require filesystems
to be redesigned to use this, but I can see how it would be useful
for doing things like ensuring ordering between just an inode and
it's data writes.  What would the overhead of having to support
several hundred thousand different barrier groups be (i.e. one per
dirty inode in a system)?

Depending on the answer to my first question:
0/ implement a specific test for filesystems to run at mount time
   to determine if barriers are supported or not.

Sounds like a good start. ;)
