Hi all
i am conio,
i am facing some problems.
I have a embedded monta vista linux kernel running on arm processor,
the linux kernel version is 2.6.x
I have developed a ethernet driver for the same.
But now i am facing a strange problems-
1) If i do a ftp for a very big file from one board to another pc
using a switching hub then
At an early stage ftp-data is normally sent to LinuxPC. Then suddenly
the embedded linux  asks the IP address of LinuxPC with using ARP.
After this point it start taking a lot of time to transfer data with
ftp command.
The packet analysis  shows there are  errors ,"TCP CHECKSUM INCORRECT".
Please help
if somebody has some idea
whether it can be a hardware / software bug???
Regards
conio
