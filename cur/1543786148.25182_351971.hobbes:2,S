I think the good news is that we can make up the exact semantics. This 
thing is used by things like file managers etc, and we've had very fuzzy 
semantics on inotify, while the new dnotify is totally new.
So it's a give-and-take of "what are the semantics people want" and "what
are reasonable semantics from the kernel VFS standpoint". I suspect we're
slowly converging on something that works for both parties ;)
