Comment these two lines... and all RESTORE_STATEs. System needs to be
stopped in order for SAVE_STATE to work, and it is not in apm case.

Do you think it is neccessary to call it "*local_*apic_nmi_driver"? It
seems way too long.

Why did you convert device_apic_nmi to *sys_*device?

This is good, if we have disable_, we should have enable_, not setup_;
but I killed _local_ part as it is way too long, then.
