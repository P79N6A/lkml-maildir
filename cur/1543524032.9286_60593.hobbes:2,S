Any known problems with WDC and 2.3.x kernels? I'm seeing regular fs
corruption here, but haven't found a reliable way to trigger it:
PIIX4; hda is WDC D135AA, ATA DISK drive, hdd is CRD-8400C, ATAPI CDROM drive
This means I can't run 2.3.x kernels at all, I'd be more reinstalling than
running. 2.2.x work fine.
