just to make sure i understood the attribute priorities right: we cannot 
just mark it WB in the PAT and expect it to be write-back - the UC of 
the MTRR will control?

ok. So it seems we dont even need all that many special cases, a "dont 
write MTRRs" and "use PATs everywhere" rule would just do the right
