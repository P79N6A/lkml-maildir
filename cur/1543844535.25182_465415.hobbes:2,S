This is a generic enough of a feature that I suspect we should hash out
a common API for it rather than having people roll their own.

This seems rather problematic, obviously you're constrained by
sets-per-way in the critical code, which is not mentioned anywhere in
this documentation. Likewise, the user locking in the critical code
should not have any reason to _care_ which way gets selected, or whether
they need to span over to 2 ways or not. Furthermore, the code itself
allows for grabbing the cache 'lock' for multiple ways in one go, which
people will need to use for tracking the total number of sets necessary
to accomodate the critical code. You are also missing an equivalent
cache_unlock().
If you have MMIO access to the cachelines, you would be better off just
having a locked-in page where you would remap the critical bits.
This could also be taken a step further for platforms that support
powering down cache ways for power management (particularly where the
lock-in would inhibit power-down).
