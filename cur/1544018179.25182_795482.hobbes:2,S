Sounds good. I will rework it along with your suggestions below.

I don't know. I could use /dev/port but my concern is that the device
spec sheet specifies that some writes should be done with outb and
others with outl. /dev/port only uses outb. Do you know if outl is
different than four outb's to a device?

Yes, if it fails the device still has a "polling" mode.
