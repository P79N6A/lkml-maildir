Greetings folks;
Kernel is 2.6.22-rc4, no other patches.
dmesg seems to be being spammed by variations of the following theme, 
variations because it could and has said floppy0 also.
floppy1: floppy timeout called
end_request: I/O error, dev fd1, sector 0
Buffer I/O error on device fd1, logical block 0
floppy driver state

There is not, and has not been for weeks, a disk in either drive, floppy1 
being a 5.25" drive I use for legacy sneakernet stuffs.  However I see these 
messages intermittently now for the last several kernel builds, reaching back 
to the 2.6.21 time frame IIRC.
Is this something that should be looked at?
