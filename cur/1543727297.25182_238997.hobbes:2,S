I did realise that it is the ABI which allows this, but I thought
that the only situation in which we know gcc to actually clobber
arguments from the callee in practice is for tailcall optimization. 
So I was looking for ways to avoid that ... assuming the way we code
the probe function is under our control. 
I'm not sure if that can be guaranteed and yes saving bytes from
stack would avoid the problem totally (hence the comment) and make
it less tied to expected innards of the compiler. The only issue 
with that is deciding the maximum number of arguments so it is 
generic enough.

Even with CONFIG_REGPARM, if you have a large 
number of arguments for example, is spill over into stack 
a possibility ?
