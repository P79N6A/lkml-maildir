Thanks!
I'd prefer if the __cli;__save_flags is embedded in the bh_kmap_irq in
the slow path case where the remap is really required. We can avoid the
cli for all the memory below 1G. This way it should also be harder to
forget to cli ;). During PIO the irq should be enabled otherwise it
means either the driver or the hardware is silly.
Plus adding a _fat_ warning in the bh_kmap_irq that nobody should
re-enable interupt in the middle.
