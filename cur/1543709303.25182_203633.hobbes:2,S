what does "easy to corrupt" mean?  i haven't really seen disks generate
bit errors ever.  this MAC means you'll need to write integrity data for
every real write.  that really doesn't seem worth it...
it seems like a block is either right, or it isn't -- the only thing the
MAC is telling you is that the block isn't right... it doesn't tell you
how to fix it.  that's a total waste of write bandwidth -- you might as
well return the bogus decrypted block.

is CTR the only mode which is weak with simple IV / block number
relationships?
if you absolutely need this IV update for every write then you should
consider a disk layout which mixes IV (or IV+MAC) blocks so that they are
grouped near their data blocks, to reduce seek overhead.
i.e. 1 block containing 15 IV+MAC, followed by 15 data blocks, followed by
IV+MAC, followed by 15 data...
