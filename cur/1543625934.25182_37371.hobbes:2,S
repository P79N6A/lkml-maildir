That doesn't make it easier though, the time we should fail is still way
earlier the relocation of the virtual address space area.

You're welcome, thanks for fixing it.

this looks wrong there may very well be a vma after our mapping but it
doesn't necessairly overlap with us (also the unlikely would make more
sense in the previous if). I hacked a bit on top of your previous patch,
this looks ok to me but it's untested:

your printk also is valid debugging trick, I think it won't be necessary
most of the time but feel free to re-add it if you like.
