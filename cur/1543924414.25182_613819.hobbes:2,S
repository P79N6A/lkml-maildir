Slab also only counts objects that are not in the queues. See free_block() 
f.e.
We could improve the situation by flushing all cpu slabs before counts are 
determined.
Which can be done manually. Run
	slabinfo -s
and then look at the numbers.

I have just spend a few weeks optimizing the fast and slow paths and there 
is some additional overhead that I am still trying to eliminate.

The performance in the fast paths depends on updating only a single word
for an allocation. Adding another counter makes that impossible.
