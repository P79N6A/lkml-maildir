It's wrong for GCC, but correct for HTML/XLink relative path
resolution.

Oh, I meant to say "will" but my mailer must have used the wrong
character encoding. :)

Right now, you can avoid crossing filesystems by calling lstat()
_except_ that it doesn't detect a bind mount.  Among other things,
this makes it difficult to know for sure when there is only one path
to a file, because n_link==1 doesn't mean that any more.  O_NOMOUNT
might be useful as a way to detect when you're crossing a bind mount.
