It doesn't unmap the region, but it doesn't allow any more page faults
from that backing vnode (the pager will get an error from the file system,
and thus send a SIGSEGV to the process), and no dirty pages can be cleaned
to that vnode.
I mean, you wouldn't invalidate any buffers the user read the file into
when the file was revoke()'d, would you? :-)
Regarding unlink()... those aren't operations on vnodes.  Those are
operations on the filesystem namespace, and are thus (correctly)
unaffected.
