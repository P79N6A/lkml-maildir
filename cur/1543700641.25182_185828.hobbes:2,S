Well, this issue has certainly attracted a lot of debate.
I have barely used devfs, but I like much of the implementation. I'm not 
familiar with udev either and so won't comment on it.
When this thread first started I had a look at the code and, I must admit, 
it is a little untidy (ugly actually). I think it would require a 
considerable amount of effort just to make it maintainable. Maybe then 
some of the problems (whatever they are) would present themselves.
So it's deprecated in 2.6. Is this only because no one is willing to take 
on maintenance of it or is it to late?
