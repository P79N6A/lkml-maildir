The hardware clut typically stores each color channel separately.  In
software terms, this is akin to struct fb_cmap.  The pseudo_palette, on
the other hand, is a pixel LUT, the contents of which can be directly
written to the framebuffer without it ever knowing the format at all, ie
it does not matter if it's RGB or YUV.  This makes the upper layer
independent of the low-lever driver (at least in terms of colorspace
formats).
