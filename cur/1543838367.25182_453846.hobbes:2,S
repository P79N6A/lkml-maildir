At most about half a dozen.  Depends whether you include pipes and eventpoll
in that.  There's an instance in fs/dcache.c and one in fs/fs-writeback.c
find_inode_number() is also a potential problem, though I suppose we have to
say you may not use it if 0 is a valid thing to have in i_ino.
Interestingly, one of these also touches userspace: /proc/locks passes the
inode number out, but will pass the wrong one if i_ino is too short.  Does
anything in userspace actually use that?
