Hi Russell,

2.2.0-pre7-ac4 has a three-column "wall of buttons".
I personally like walls of buttons.  I appreciate constructive feedback
on my design choice.  I am a language geek, not a GUI designer.  (I can
hear the cries of "You got that right!" already).
Oh no, now I'm asking for a look-and-feel war.  Please guys, focus your
opinions as "this is why I like my favorite look and feel for xconfig",
not "this is why anyone whose opinion is different from mine must be
a bozo."
Also, any design has to have a very simple, very reliable implementation.
I know scrollbars are; Hannu Lyytinen already sent me one patch for that,
and it's mostly re-arranging frames and canvases in header.tk.  Submenus
involve digging around in tkgen.c.
But I really like the idea of submenus and I will _consider_ submenu
patches after Alan merges in my new tkparse code.
