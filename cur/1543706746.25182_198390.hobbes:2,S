It is a small loss that the TCQ-support implementation hasn't been stable on
linux so far. I guess mostly due to the great I/O scheduling Linux has (ie
anticipatory scheduler).
Yes, a growing number of IDE disk manufacturers are using native S-ATA
controllers in their disks, and TCQ is one of the core features (ie unique selling
point), as well as being implemented on the more lavish P-ATA controllers.
It's just a shame that there are still issues saturating a bunch of IDE
disks with software RAID in the 2.6 series, but I guess that'll be ironed out in
time...
