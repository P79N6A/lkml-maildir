Agreed - the only one that seems at all a *big* win is randomizing PID's
(and even there it probably should default a higher value for pid_max to
increase the search space).  But as long as I was looking at it anyhow.. :)

OK.. I can do that easily enough - only reason I didn't was because that would
force the inclusion of ip_randomid() and the corresponding call even when the
feature wasn't selected, making it more intrusive (the 'else' clause is also the
"when not configured at all" code - moving the whole if/then/else to another
function was more intrusive, to my thinking..)

Thanks for spotting that.  It's the same way in grsecurity's patch - do they
have an issue as well?  Or they OK because they're only doing a separately
distributed patch?
