Hi,
Here's another device mapper update, some of these are quite big
patches, so I'll run through the list:
endio method
  We've been using this code for many months (years?).  Needed for the
  more complicated targets.
Remove the version-1 ioctl interface
  This didn't get in last time I submitted it.  Leave it out if you
  still disagree.
Audit for list_for_each_*entry*
  Trivial, please merge
Queue limits
  Please merge.
List targets ioctl
  Adds a command that lets tools query the kernel to see what
  targets/versions are available.
Multipath target
  People really want this, so I'm probably pushing it sooner than I'd
  like.  It would be good if it got a wider audience in the -mm tree or
  as an experimental target in vanilla.
Thanks,
- Joe
