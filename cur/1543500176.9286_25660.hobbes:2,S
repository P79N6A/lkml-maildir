hallo !
i had read /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Configure.help and README from
solemul RPM package. i follow steps there ... and i still can't get modul
solaris.o for emulation.
i tried run binaries without this module and i got Segmentation fault.
I really need this emulation :(
if you can help me, please e-mail me at my email pavuk@perzeus.tuke.sk
