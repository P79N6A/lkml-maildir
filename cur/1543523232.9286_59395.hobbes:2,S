Well,  sometimes   only  the  application  can   have  _the_  specific
information  which helps  scheduling.  This  information might  be too
special  to  be coded  into  the  OS level  and  hurt  in the  average
case.... Just my thoughts.
(By the  way. To all in this  thread: improving scheduling in  linux is
far too interesting to be cluttered by bashing.)
