Subject: [patch 10/40] usb-storage: set CAPACITY_HEURISTICS flag for bad vendors
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
commit a81a81a25d3ecdab777abca87c5ddf484056103d upstream.
This patch (as1194c) makes usb-storage set the CAPACITY_HEURISTICS flag
for all devices made by Nokia, Nikon, or Motorola.  These companies
seem to include the READ CAPACITY bug in all of their devices.
Since cell phones and digital cameras rely on flash storage, which
always has an even number of sectors, setting CAPACITY_HEURISTICS
shouldn't cause any problems.  Not even if the companies wise up and
start making devices without the bug.
A large number of unusual_devs entries are now unnecessary, so the
patch removes them.
