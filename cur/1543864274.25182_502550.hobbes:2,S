Subject: [SCRIPT] Remove "space damage" from patches

Hello Andrew and all
I recently tried "git-apply" on the 2.6.20-rc6-mm1 patch and found it to complain about white-spaces.
So as a mean to (hopefully) cut down on these nasty white-spaces (and sometimes tabs) I wrote this
little script. All it does is checking (lines that are going to be added) for spaces before tabs
and trailing spaces/tabs. I tried it on 2.6.20-rc6-mm1 and it seem to work well
If there is someone interested, _please_ take it. Any suggestion are welcomed :)
