Hello All,
I am facing a problem in using rtnetlink sockets and thought that 
this mailing list would be the better to place to clarify.  
Can anyone calrify my query.  
When I tried deleting an interface, I have received message
 RTM_NEWLINK (instead of  RTM_DELLINK) from kernel.
I have executed the attached program and did "/sbin/ifdown eth0"..
and my program received a messsage RTM_NEWLINK from kernel
instead of RTM_DELLINK.
When I  tried adding the interface "/sbin/ifup eth0".. it works fine 
and received RTM_NEWLINK.
I would like to know whether anyone has faced this problem or
am I missing something in my program.
Thanks,
Rajesh.
