1. Requiring the kernel to read the partition table information is a
BUG.
2. Falling back on the values which are used by the application 
afterwards is a BUG. (BIOS IRQ after all)
3. Not detecting LBA disk access is required by checking Cylinder value
to emulate BIOS behaviour is a BUG.
4. Asking the kernel to kindly avoid 100% partition table scanning and
*guessing* some *heuristic* values which fail frequently enough is a 
BUG. (Take a look at the jumps and hops in the function in question if
you don't think it is guessing. I recommend the switch in esp.)
5. Relying on the kernel for the translation "trick" himself (if
anything) is a BUG.
6. It's after all no more inconvenient then renaming well for example
the USB host controller module.
7. It is *not* breaking backward compatibility. After the lilo 
configuration fix the old  kernel boots fine as well.
Not reading confusing lilo docs which should better say what to do is a
BUG.
