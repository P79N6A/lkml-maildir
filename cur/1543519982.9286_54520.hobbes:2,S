Run two memtest processes (by Simon Kirby,
ftp://blue.netnation.com/pub/memtest.c
) with memory sizes of 2/3 of the
total ram so that the machine swaps heavily when the two processes are
fighting for resident memory. After a few minutes one of the memtest
processes reports memory error. It means that there has been an error in
either writing data to swap or reading it back. The memory corruption is
silent so that there are no error messages in syslog nor does the memtest
process die of any signal.
I use PIO mode in multiple sector mode (IDE block mode). The problem does
not affect modern systems which use DMA.
