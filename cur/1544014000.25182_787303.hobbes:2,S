Both the 'n's look bogus to me as runtime checks.  But I think the code happens
to work correctly - apart from your compilation problem.
buf is always a page and both strings (name and uuid) are NULL-terminated and
the longest possible is 128 chars of uuid plus the "\n" i.e. 130 (except for a
bug I noticed on one code path which we'll fix).
