Subject: [PATCH 1/3] boot with Gujin: add script/{gzcopy.c,gzparam.c} to generate linux.kgz file format
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

 Gujin is a GPL bootloader (homepage 
http://gujin.org
) which can not only
load the standard vmlinuz file format but also a simpler format, called
Gujin native format, filename using the extension *.kgz.
 It is simply the standard ELF executable file vmlinux translated to binary
image by OBJCOPY and compressed by GZIP.
 The GZIP format (rfc1952) define a way to add a comment to the GZIP file,
it is used extensively to add information to the kernel, like the loading
and running address, the processors supported, the 4 Kb memory parameter
address, the text/video modes accepted at startup. This comment string
is unlimited (finishes at the next '\0').
 Unfortunately there isn't any tools around to display or manipulate this
field, vi/emacs would work but are not the best tools.
 So this patch create a file script/gzcopy.c and Makefile rules to produce
script/gzcopy which can be use to view, change (set/append/prepend) comment
to GZIP files. Type "./script/gzcopy --help" for a list of switches.
This first file (and only this one) is released under a BSD license to
enable anybody else to add it in a "GZIP distribution" if needed,
it follow special rules for indentation and a special way to define
strings so that localisation should be simpler.
 This patch also contains the simple script/gzparam.c file and its
Makefile rules - that is a simple standalone program to display a text
line on stdout containing the base pattern to generate the GZIP comment
itself for this configured kernel.
 It extract the Linux configuration using file
../include/linux/autoconf.h because that seems to be the easiest way
when compilation time is not a problem.
 Just type "make script/gzparam && ./script/gzparam" to see the line
produced after the kernel configuration.
