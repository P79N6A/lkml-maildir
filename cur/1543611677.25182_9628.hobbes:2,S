The symlink problem you're reporting is exactly what i've been experiencing among
other things ...
on both systems i had multiple ext2 partitions and one reseirfs partition.
The problem showed up after a few days of uptime. Both machines where not heaviliy
loaded and had no memory shortage.
It looks like it also happened on my third system, which had only 2 ext2 partitions
. I was able to clean up this one with fsck and rebooted safely to 2.4.14 ....
Given the fact that i'm not the only one to see the problem with 2.4.16 i'll safely
backtrack all my machines to 2.4.14 ...
If i can be of any help to pinpoint the problem please let me know. But since i'm
not a kernel hacker i don't think i'll be pluging into the sources myself on my own
!
Thanks for the feedback !
