Subject: block_dev.c: fsync() on close() considered harmful

I'm running an INN usenet news server that uses raw partitions for
storage. I.e. it opens /dev/sda7 etc. and mmap()s [which finally
works in 2.4, hurray]
Even though the server is keeping those devices open, when a utility
program opens that file/device and closes() it the close() causes
a fsync() on the device, something that is not wanted.
I applied the following patch which fixes it for me, it prevents
the sync-after-close if it was close() calling blkdev_put()
and we're not the last one to call blkdev_put().
That means fsync() will still be done on unmounts or when the
last user of the device closes it, but not otherwise.
Is this correct or am I overlooking something?
