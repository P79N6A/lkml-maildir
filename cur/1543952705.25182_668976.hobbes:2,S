Ouch, what have you done? It should be about 200MB, not 7GB.

Well, even with old git you can just do 
	git repack -a -d
and in your case you'll probably have to leave it running overnight, 
because it's going to take hours since you've clearly not ever repacked it 
before and as a result it's going to do lots and lots of IO (all that 7GB 
and then read much of it twice).
But yeah, upgrading git first is probably a good idea regardless.

Yes:
	[torvalds@woody linux]$ git describe 7c0ea45be4f114d85ee35caeead8e1660699c46f
	v2.6.25-rc5-89-g7c0ea45
so it happened after -rc5.

Somebody more into ACPI needs to judge how likely this is to be an issue..
