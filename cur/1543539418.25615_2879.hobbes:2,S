True.

There is nothing in kernel that would violate the standard. There is
code that lets you send invalid commands to the drive, if you really
want to.
The disk-destroyer.c example only overwrites the master boot sector with
zeroes. This isn't a violation of any standard.
Also, unless the drive has very broken firmware, it shouldn't fry itself
when given invalid commands. The drive itself would have to violate the
spec to be allowed to do that in the first place.
If it was the kernel, that under some unusual pattern of usage would
emit an invalid IDE command, then it'd be a serious bug.
But if it just lets root emit an invalid IDE command, while the root has
to know what he's doing, because he needs to write a C program for that,
then it's just a feature that allows him to screw himself. But there are
many like that in the kernel.

Ok, why not. But I don't see any reason in inspecting every call to the
HDIO_DRIVE_CMD ioctl checking the input parameters for correctness.
If the root wants to be paranoid, he can switch the feature off.

As said before, removing the ioctl doesn't make destroying the disk
much tougher. The program to do it would be about ten to twenty lines
longer.

It doesn't violate anything. It allows the root to do it if he wants to.

Honestly, I don't know how I'd destroy anything in my system by sofware.
Including the harddrive.

Well, as Andre put it, the 'fix' for the 'problem' is rather extensive
(several hundred lines added to kernel). Is this worth for a feeible
protection against selffootshooting?
Also, if I understand the patch correctly, it kills all possibilities of
for example drive firmware update without first adding support to that
to the kernel explicitly. Is this really worth it?
