  I don't even *have* an /etc/nsswitch.conf (or /etc/host.conf) file.
I thought that would make me safe and predictable, but perhaps not.  (:
I also figured a glibc issue would be held constant regardless of the
kernel rev, but that is looking like a bad assumption.
  I need to play with glibc anyway because of all the security foo, so
I think I'll beat on that angle a bit.
