Perhaps in your case you had just an
int a = 0;
then it's really just a few bytes, but many sources have for example
int a[1024] = { 0, 0, /* .... */ };
Which in turn is a big wastage.
On the other hand, if you save "just" a few bytes in every driver, in a
way that is safe and simple (and commenting out the = 0 is a safe way),
you get a lot of space saved in the sum.
