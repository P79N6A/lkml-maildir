Not the way things are going with multicore and multithread, though
(that is, the hardware can be one socket and still have many cpus).
The chip might have several memory controllers on it, but they could
well be connected to the caches with a crossbar, so it needn't be
NUMA at all. Future scalability work shouldn't rely on many cores
~= many nodes, IMO.
