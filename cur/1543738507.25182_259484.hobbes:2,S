	OK.  Please disregard my previous patch.  Thanks for
your clarification.
	The problem I saw was due to my mistake in merging the
2.6.9-rc3 change that added request_queue->max_sectors with one
of my local changes (replacing some fields in struct request_queue
with struct io_restrictions, a patch which I should repost one of
these days).
