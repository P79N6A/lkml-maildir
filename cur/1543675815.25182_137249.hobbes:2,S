Well, Redhat do have "sanitized kernel headers", but according to the
whole thread about glibc being broken, it is not the preferred solution.
The solution is to have a set of API headers that userspace can use,
and that the kernel headers in turn include.
Problem now (as usual), is that even though I and a few others did
offer to help or organise help if one kernel hacker is willing to take
the lead, nobody responded, so I guess we will not see this any time
soon.

Same here, as the "solution" will not be seen any time soon :/
