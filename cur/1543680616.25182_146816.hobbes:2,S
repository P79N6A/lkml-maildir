 The compiler could easily tell what memory can be clobbered by a pointer
by applying type-based aliasing rules. For example, a function taking a
"char *" can't clobber memory objects declared as "long bar" or
"struct foo".
 Without type based alias analysis, the compiler is forced to flush
all registers containing copies of memory objects before function
call and reloading values from memory afterwards.

 I'm afraid you're right. Here's a code snippet from gcc/calls.c that
shows what the compiler _really_ does for pure calls:
  /* If the result of a pure or const function call is ignored (or void),
     and none of its arguments are volatile, we can avoid expanding the
     call and just evaluate the arguments for side-effects.  */
  if ((flags & (ECF_CONST | ECF_PURE))
      && (ignore || target == const0_rtx
          || TYPE_MODE (TREE_TYPE (exp)) == VOIDmode))
    {
      bool volatilep = false;
      tree arg;
      for (arg = actparms; arg; arg = TREE_CHAIN (arg))
        if (TREE_THIS_VOLATILE (TREE_VALUE (arg)))
          {
            volatilep = true;
            break;
          }
      if (! volatilep)
        {
          for (arg = actparms; arg; arg = TREE_CHAIN (arg))
            expand_expr (TREE_VALUE (arg), const0_rtx,
                         VOIDmode, EXPAND_NORMAL);
          return const0_rtx;
        }
    }
Therefore this optimization is to be undone. Would it work if
we could use references instead of pointers? I think it
wouldn't. A new attribute would be needed for this case.
Just to open some interesting speculation, do you think we'd
get better code by just getting rid of __attribute__((pure))
or by changing __do_div64() to do something like this?
 typedef struct { uint64_t quot, uint32_t rem } __quotrem64;
 __quotrem64 __do_div64(uint64_t div, uint32_t base) __attribute__((const));
 #define do_div(n,base) ({                                        \
        uint32_t __base = (base);                                 \
        uint32_t __rem;                                           \
        if (likely(((n) >> 32) == 0)) {                           \
                __rem = (uint32_t)(n) % __base;                   \
                (n) = (uint32_t)(n) / __base;                     \
        } else {                                                  \
                __quotrem64 __qr = __div64_32((n), __base);       \
                (n) = __qr.quot;                                  \
                __rem = __qr.rem;                                 \
        }                                                         \
        __rem;                                                    \
 })
Boy, that's ugly! It's too bad C can't do it the Perl way:
    (n,rem) = __div64_32(n, base);
