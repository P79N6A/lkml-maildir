Adrian, please note that this is NOT the normal "suspend to ram/disk" stuff
that is being discussed / affected here.  But rather something brand new 
(to Linux), the automatic powerdown (well, nearly) of idle USB devices
during regular running.
Things will work just fine without chewing up gobs of memory in a futile effort
to list everything inside the kernel.  Devices will plug in and work fine
(which they didn't in 2.6.23 until this stuff got reverted) the same as always.
To gain the last xx% in power savings, some userspace support may be needed,
that's all.  And with the pace of new/updated USB devices coming/going these days,
userspace is really the only appropriate place for this kind of stuff.
Cheers
