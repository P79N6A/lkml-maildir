We've fixed a lot of regressions and made a lot of other changes to the
scheduler since .23. Could you please try the backport of the latest
scheduler on top of .23 to see if any of our recent work solved your
problem? (using a backport against .23 or even .22 allows you to test
just the scheduler changes in isolation)

Also, it could be dbench is one of those benchmarks that favours
unfairness, I seem to remember so.. still we should not regress too much
without a very good reason.
