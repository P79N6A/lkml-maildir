A quick summary of what I've been tracking, some have already gone in,
but I'll wait for rc1 to do a pass over all this and send out a summary.
What: CONFIG_FORCED INLINING:
-removal patch being tested in x86.git, upstream unlikely for 2.6.25,
not a big deal to wait for 2.6.26

This has been done and is currently in scsi-misc awaiting for a pull.

Well the in-kernel callers have not all been converted yet. I have
actually done the work, but it needs testing and merging by maintainers.
Getting it done during this merge window would be nice, I'm going to
try to make that happen after I get back from LCA. Otherwise probably
2.6.26.

Stephen Hemminger sent a removal patch to Jeff, it probably was too big
for the mailing list.
Ping?

GregKH: This is queued up in my tree to go to Linus, see my previous
post on
lkml and the linux-usb mailing list about this topic.

Still some users in-tree, some discussion happening on how to get this
finished.
