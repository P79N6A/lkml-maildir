Chris had mentioned the stacker_capable not being quite right.  I'm
looking at it now, and yeah, it's a little convoluted.  I think a simpler
if (!stacked_modules) {
	/* same as before
}
final_result = 0;
for (m = stacked_modules; m; m = m->next) {
	result = (m->module_operations).capable(tsk,cap);
	if (result && !final_result) {
		final_result = result;
		if (short_circuit_capable)
			break;
	}
}
return final_result;
should be correct.
