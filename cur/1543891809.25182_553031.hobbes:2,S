Erm, no I think you're wrong there (or we're talking at cross
purposes).  They're visible to the whole function they're defined in,
regardless of what block scope happens to be current at the time.  You
need to use the gcc "__label__" extension to make a locally-scoped
label.  Otherwise this wouldn't work:
	if (a_failed)
		goto cleanup;
	[...]
	if (b_failed) {
cleanup:
		cleanup();
	}
