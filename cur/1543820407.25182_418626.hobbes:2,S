C++ is a system programming language with good C compatibility. Making 
the kernel compatible with C++ is doable.
Haskell is an excellent language, but it is not a system programming 
language. Kernel programming does not fit well into the functional model.

That's certainly doable, however it is quite pointless since we know 
that the code will be rejected regardless of any technical merits it may 
have.
