Well, it is easy to make a mistake writing it down...

WHAT?  I have captured 1200/75 'prestel' style modem communications on tape, and played them back through a speaker, in to a phone handset, and had them faithfully reproduced on a terminal.  Having said that, trying to use a 300 bps accustic coupler with a GSM phone wasn't successful, because you get some kind of inductive interference from the phone.

Hmmm, that might be worth doing, because it gives you a way to automatically recover the data, rather than typing it in again, (which is prone to errors).
