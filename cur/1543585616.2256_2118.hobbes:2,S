You were lucky. Its quite possible for V6 to kill processes when you run out
of swap

No such guarantee ever existed. There are systems that had stuff like per
user memory quotas but those were mostly much more mainframe oriented

No. You cannot free the inode and buffer cache arbitarily. You only have a
probability - that puts you back at square 1.

malloc is merely an accounting exercise (actually its mostly mmap 
accounting). ptrace is the only quirk. Nobody feels its very important because
nobody has implemented it.
