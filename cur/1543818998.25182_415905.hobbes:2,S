There are a few possible answers -
If when this virtualization stuff is done, no one has done anything with
time, someone is going to moan.
Once in a while, you want to fiddle your system clock to make sure that
a cron job or something does what it's supposed to.
There was some extra infrastructure that UML needed in order to start using
this stuff, so I chose a fairly simple virtualization case to accompany it.

Yeah, names can be changed.

No, the domain stores an offset from the system time, so it automatically
gets the system's NTP adjustments.
