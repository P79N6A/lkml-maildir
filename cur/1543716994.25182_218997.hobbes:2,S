<sigh> You're may be right. Having to convert from a u64 nanosec value
to a timeval in sys_gettimeofday() as well as get_seconds() may be a
performance problem. But I'm not completely convinced, as we already
have to play games shifting from timevals to timespecs and back. I'm not
sure the nsec/1000000 will kill us.  
Pragmatically I'm willing to bend on that one by using timespecs instead
of u64s. But while I'm in the design phase, thinking of the problem as
juggling u64 nanoseconds simplifies it. Be it a u64 or a timespec, it
really doesn't change the design all that much. One you get to use "+"
and the other you use "time_add()".
