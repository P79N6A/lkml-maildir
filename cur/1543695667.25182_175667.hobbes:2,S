I have never believed that any one implementation of (in CGL speak) "persistent
device naming" would be palatable by everyone, and have no problem in donating
some resources toward udev.  
In the past we experimented with udev, and even did a little work on
sysfsutils (which I though udev was using, but looking at udev-005 I still
see the libsysfs directory.)
I see the the TODO list in udev-005.  Are all these items wide open, or have
people already spoken for some parts?  Maybe you have a couple of items you 
consider higher priority?
