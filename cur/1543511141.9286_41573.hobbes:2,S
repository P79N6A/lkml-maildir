    The ll_rw_block has already converted the raw ascii text on disk (in
    block numbers) into a sector number, so the reverse transform in the
    printk just restores what was in the original corrupt indirect block.
    So it _does_ mean that we found text in an indirect block after all.
Hmm. I quoted the code
    count = bh->b_size >> 9;
    sector = bh->b_rsector;
    printk("%d", (sector + count)>>1);
Are you saying that (sector + count)>>1 was found on disk ?
Or only sector>>1 ?
