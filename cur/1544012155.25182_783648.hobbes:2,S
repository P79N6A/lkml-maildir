It's standard SPI ... yes, it's kind of interesting, and I've
not come across anything else that synchronizes RX and TX in
quite the same way.
I suspect that hardware designers find the ability to get
quick transfers (tens of megabits/second) from just a shift
register is fairly attractive.  Less work than high speed
I2C, for one example.

Fair enough.  That file does lack any mention of the I/O model
for SPI ... and it's certainly a bit of a surprise to anyone
who's not had to look at it before!

I'm not sure I'd agree with that -- while he's many things,
"expert in everything" is not one of them! -- but I do agree
that comment would be worth adding.
However, with regards to $PATCH ... considering that the '28
release is just around the corner, I changed my mind and would
suggest just reverting f9b90e39cbc5c4d6ef60022fd1f25d541df0aad1
much though I very much like that fix in general.
Reason being:  it needs a bit more work, I forgot that it will
break for example drivers using drivers/spi/omap_uwire.c since
that is built on top of truly half-duplex hardware.  (Used with
OMAP1 SOCs.)  The kerneldoc says it's for providing MicroWire
style transactions, so it's kind of significant that it work
on MicroWire hardware too.  ;)
So an updated version would need to both zero the TX bits when
using normal full-duplex SPI hardware ... and use more or less
the current code when running on half-duplex variants.
