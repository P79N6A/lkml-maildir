It was all "flight by instruments only". I called for HW testers and none 
came forward. All these changes, apart from "successful downgrade to messy"
where also needed in order to push important changes to scsi.
But a little bird said that QEMU might simulate this HW. SO I guess it is
QEMU time for me.
