Ok,
  I just got a "NIC100" linksys 10/100 card.  I compiled the driver
into the kernel for the DEC Tulip drivers.  After installing the kernel
just like normal I reboot.  The device, eth0, is visable, up and apparently
see'ing packets.   I can't use the interface though.
  I can't paste it since it's not on the network but I can read it.
TX packets: 1554  errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
RX packets: 0 errors:4 dropped:3794 overruns:0 carrier:0
collisons:0 txqueuelen:100
Interrupt:9 Base address:0xe800
Everything else looks just like what was in the last card and this
machines.  The card works fine in Windows.  
The machine:
  AMD-K6-2-500 (not overclocked)
  128Meg mem
  IDE disks
  kernel 2.2.15-pre-4
HELP?
Robert
:wq!
