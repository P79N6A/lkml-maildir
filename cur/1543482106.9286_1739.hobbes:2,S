O.k.
Will fetch the good version.

System is configured for autoloading.

Yep 8*)
Just joking.

Will try this and debugging too and get back to you.

Yes, you are right if there are only two entries to keep track of.

No, i don't have one at this point in time, but was thinking about
a nice kind of "one for all" service devfs could do for each driver.
This would avoid to do (lots) of devfs_unregister() calls
in each driver _and_ to hold the entry data for all of them.
The idea has been born while having a look at some of the devfs driver
patches (for egg. in sd.c), where you create a directory /dev/sd/
which in turn could have lots of subdirectories (it doesn't in sd.c devfs
use, but it could as an example).
The actual scsi disk scenario of up to 128 disks with up to 16 partitions each
;*) causes the registration of up to 2048 specials in the directories.
The current implementation removes _all_ the entries (>2048 in my example)
including the top one with _one_ devfs_unregister() call given _one_
devfs_handle of the top level entry /dev/sd/.
Only that _one_ devfs_handle has to be stored and handled by the driver.
But in addition to this the example implies 2048 compatibility nodes to.
If the recursive delete in devfs_unregister would include the
compatibility links too, 2048 devfs_unregister in the driver could be avoided.

Heinz
