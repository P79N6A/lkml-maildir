	I just wanted to let you folks know that
linux-2.3.41/drivers/char/mxser.c does not compile, because it uses
some private declarations in <linux/serialP.h> that are no longer
pulled in, such as SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE and struct asnc_icount.  I can
send you a patch to make it compile by including <linux/serialP.h>,
although I am not sure if this is correct, because I am not quite
sure of the purpose of the <linux/serialP.h> file.
