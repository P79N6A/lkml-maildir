Do you have the right kernel configuratoin?  It sounds like
you need to load the modules (or set modules.conf to
auto-load them with "alias" lines)
On linux 2.4 you need ppp_generic, ppp_async, slhc loaded
with modprobe or insmod.
on 2.4 config options under "network device support"
<M> PPP (point-to-point protocol) support
[ ]   PPP multilink support (EXPERIMENTAL)
<M>   PPP support for async serial ports
<M>   PPP support for sync tty ports
<M>   PPP Deflate compression
<M>   PPP BSD-Compress compression
<M>   PPP over Ethernet (EXPERIMENTAL)
your using a modem?  cable or ADSL?
reply to me privately, as linux-kernel probably isn't
the place to discuss this since it sounds like an install
issue... if we find it's a kernel bug then it would be ok.
if you're using a 2.2 kernel i suggest you try the
one that came with your distribution.
oh yeah what is your distribution?
Cheers,
Jeremy
