First batch of this work turned up in my tree in 2.5.14-dj2, seems to be
behaving well, so that should be going to Linus soon. With that out of
the way, (plus some other smaller split-up work like mtrr), the path
should be paved for x86 subarch support.

Sounds ok. visws is after all, an x86 subarch. Though we should probably
get some input from the folks who are actually still maintaining this
out-of-tree. I believe they have a project at sourceforge with newer
visws code than whats in mainline.
Other than Patricks work, and yours, the only other bits that are poking
arch/i386 anytime soon are probably ACPI and possibly some further
splitting up by one of the IBM folks whose name I've currently forgotten.
