Hi,
it seems the Configure.help text for CONFIG_LP_CONSOLE
is incorrect: The default is to stall until the printer
is ready while the help text says the opposite.
(vi +540 drivers/char/lp.c)
Attached is a patch for 2.4.6-pre1 which fixes the help text.
Also, shouldn't CONFIG_LP_CONSOLE depend on CONFIG_PRINTER=y?
(it doesn't work when CONFIG_PRINTER=m, at least for me)

   doing that; to actually get it to happen you need to pass the
   option "console=lp0" to the kernel at boot time.

   If unsure, say N.
