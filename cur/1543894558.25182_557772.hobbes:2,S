Ah no, it's their fault. The GPLv2 always was clear that there will be some 
future releases of the GPL, and that you should keep "upgrading" possible.

The GPLv2 tries hard to be compatible with any further versions of the GPL 
as possible, by allowing people to choose which license you take, and by 
making sure that no man in the middle can restrict this choice. If people 
deliberately select to use "GPLv2 only", who's to blame? RMS? Come on, 
that's bullshit. It's *Linus Torvalds* who made Linux incompatible with 
GPLv3, nobody else - ok, Al Viro with his tagged GPLv2 files (and honestly, 
I think this is just another Linus misinterpretation about the GPL, and he 
really didn't do it, because he couldn't).
This thread was fun, but I think all arguments have been repeated often 
enough. I try to give up. I suggest everyone who has some assertions about 
what the GPLv2 does read it through and find the place where it says so. 
Unfortunately, I haven't seen GPL citations from the Linus-fanboy curve, 
only suggestions that the GPL "does not say something" which it clearly 
does.
