I have been wanting to follow the cpumeter discussion more closely,
but currently am tied up. I hope to have more time towards the end of
this week.
I had a few queries below, though

One of the reasons for overloading the cpu_exclusive flag was to
ensure that the rebalance code does not try to pull tasks unnecessarily
With the scheme that you are proposing that is a possibility if
you turn on the cpu_exclusive and meter_cpu for example and not
turn on sched_domain. Is there a reason why we would want to have
exclusive cpusets not attached to sched domains at all?
I am not entirely convinced that we can compare sched_domains and 
meter_cpus.
However I am still open if there is a convincing reason to have
exclusive cpusets that dont form sched domains.
