Hi guys,
I have a ide raid setup and was using the Reiserfs code known to cause 
filesystem corruption.  The questions is: How do we recover from this 
corruption?  I have the latest reiserfs utils and the latest code from the 
website and the latest kernel.  When I mount /dev/md0, I still get problems 
while listing files.  The kernel previous to this one was giving these 
errors (2.4.2-ac5):
Mar  5 16:08:15 bertha kernel: vs-13048: reiserfs_iget: bad_inode. Stat 
data of (698895 780972) not found
Mar  5 16:08:16 bertha kernel: vs-13048: reiserfs_iget: bad_inode. Stat 
data of (698895 929630) not found
Mar  5 16:08:17 bertha kernel: vs-13048: reiserfs_iget: bad_inode. Stat 
data of (698895 778316) not found
I get no such errors in this kernel, but the filesystem is not 
usable.  Here is what happens if I try to access this filesystem:
[root@bertha adm]# ls -l LOG
-rw-r-----    1 pcbackup pcbackup    32387 Mar  7 14:55 LOG
[root@bertha adm]# tail -f LOG
tail: LOG: Bad address
tail: tail.c:727: recheck: Assertion `valid_file_spec (f)' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
[root@bertha adm]# su pcbackup
sh-2.04$ tail LOG
tail: LOG: Bad address
sh-2.04$
Here is the output from "strace tail -f LOG".  These are the last few 
relevant lines:
