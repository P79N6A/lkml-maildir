I've been following the LKML for years.  Long enough to be
worried about Andre, who has coronary artery disease and drives
ridiculously fast automobiles -- two reasons (at least) for him
to be dead or disabled.
Anyone know where he is?
Andre, I miss your mangled English!  Please report in.
Merry Christmas, wherever you are...
