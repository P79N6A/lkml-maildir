No.
The multi-mount thing is a _major_ feature, and the fact that your "mount"
binary seems to be confused by it is a user-level problem and nothing
more.
There are many absolutely vital reasons for multi-mounting, so it's
extremely useful. Think about:
 - chroot environments, where you want to mount the same filesystem as
   outside the chroot thing. Imagine having your /usr/share thing mounted
   read-only, for example. Things like that.
 - user-private areas - where users see their own version of their tree.
   This can be quite powerful for things like emulation, or simply for
   namespace cleanliness.
 - automounting. "autofs" will use this to mount your local home directory
   the _right_ way. So you'd have the same filesystem mounted as both
	/export/home/machine/torvalds ("native" location)
	/home/torvalds (auto-mount location)
   automounting is also why you want to be able to do things like mounting
   multiple different filesystems at the same point, etc.
Now, I agree that it is inconvenient that the user-space mount binary
hasn't historically known about these things, but I think the current
linux-util stuff already has a multi-mount aware mount that won't be
confused by the fact that the kernel can do more than it historically was
able to.
