Hello all...
	No joy with this joystick and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.
	I just received a Logitech USB Wingman Force Joystick.  I have
the iforce module compiled and loaded and the it recognizes the USB
joystick.

	Trouble is "jstest /dev/js0" says no such device.
	My RedHat 6.2 system initially had the following js devices:
	c 15 0	js0
	c 15 1	js1
	c 15 2	js2
	c 15 3	js3
	I was also getting these errors in /var/log/messages:
Sep 18 14:51:52 alcove modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module char-major-15
	The file linux/Documentation/joystick.txt says to use 13, 0-3,
so I changed it to this:
	c 13 0	js0
	c 13 1	js1
	c 13 2	js2
	c 13 3	js3
	Still no go, but at least I'm not getting the modprobe errors now.
My USB mouse on c 13, 63 is working like a charm.
	This is with kernel 2.4.0-test8
	So, I assume that I'm still missing something obvious here.  What?
	Any thoughts anyone?
	Mike
