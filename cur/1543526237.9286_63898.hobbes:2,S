It worked great Andrea.  No matter what I did (even simulating stupid
booboos) the kernel never lost it's teeth.  Nor was I able to get it
to loop.  I even ran it completely out of vm by intentionally leaking
shm ultil the well ran completely dry.  That's not a particularly good
thing to do, but I wanted to see if the kill problem was truely gone.
[besides, what's one more fsck run:]
