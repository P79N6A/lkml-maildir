We can certainly do that for the wwpn (->port_name). For the fcp_lun we
would need to extend the fc transport class.
The hba_id doesn't belong to the fc transport class at all. It's just
the busid of our host adapter, so that we can identify it uniquely.
By the way, Christoph asked why we have the zfcp lldd in
drivers/s390/scsi. This is just for historical reasons. If you don't
mind seeing a ~32000 lines patch we can move it to drivers/scsi/zfcp.
