Subject: 2.6.0-test problems loading network drivers

I have a Compaq Presario 12XL325 laptop which continues to have problems 
with some kernel hacking options (see bugzilla 973).  While I continue to 
test new bitkeeper and -mm kernel builds, I also work around them by 
building a kernel with the problematic options disabled in order to test 
other features.
While testing the new kernel builds I have run across a problem loading 
the pcmcia network drivers (SMC 2632W wireless ethernet card).  My pcmcia 
controller is defined as follows:
00:0a.0 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1410 PC card Cardbus

The operating environment is RedHat 9.  I have enclosed various system 
files I figure to be of interest.  
Attachment 1 is the configuration used to build the kernel
Attachment 2 is /proc/interrupts 
Attachment 3 is /proc/ioports
Attachment 4 is the full lspci output for my system
However, the following show the 
difference between how 2.4 handles card insertion events vs. how 2.6-test 
handles those events.  Maybe someone could either tell me this is a kernel 
problem, or else say how I could update my system to handle this situation 
in 2.6.  Thanks in advance.
First, here is how 2.4 handles the events:
original dmesg output
