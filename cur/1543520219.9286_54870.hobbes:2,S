It might be a rather good idea if the programmers at IBM check string
lengths before letting their software die after client input. Nota bene:
Solaris 7 returns up to 257 charactes as release version, Linux
65. Using 8 byte buffers is not a sign of big care.

I'm not sure, it would most probably not solve our problem, since: the
client runs on Linux (and invokes uname, getting a 22 character release
string), the server software runs on a Solaris machine, the server
software dies. Nothing wrong with the Linux kernel, IMNSHO. (Unless, of
course, the kernel choked when somebody put a >= 60 character
EXTRAVERSION into the /usr/src/linux/Makefile. Never tried so.)
Thanks for your offer anyways.
