Hi !
Why are we calling driver suspend routines in these ? This is _not_ a
good idea ! On various machines, the mecanisms for shutting down are
quite different from suspend/resume, and current drivers have too many
bugs to make that safe. I keep getting all sort of reports of machines
not shutting down anymore.
Ben.
