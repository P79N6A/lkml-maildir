No, as I said separately:  the standard spi_master.setup() call does
this.  Things are arranged so that drivers using this code can splice
in their own code for it ... true bitbangers won't, because the
delays in the I/O loops suffice.  But drivers using "word-at-a-time"
controllers (hardware-assisted shift registers!) will, as will ones
that do "buffer-at-a-time" I/O (e.g. to stuff/unstuff fifos, or set
up non-queued DMA).

I suppose it'd make sense to just fail if max_speed_hz is invalid,
and if there's some board that an bitbang at over 10MHz we should
avoid getting in its way.

Added.  Instead of "1", "BITBANG_CS_ACTIVE" ... which will normally
pull the nCS line low (after setting clock to match CPOL).

The relevant chip delays seem to be specified in usecs ... I don't
like using nsecs for the clock timings, but without doing that it'd
be impractical to define rates at the levels the hardware actually
uses.  There are still some "nsec" leakages out of the real-bitbang
code up to the next level, fixable over time.

OK.  That'd be more work for the controller driver, but you're
right that a lot of the drivers using these utilities are rather
likely to be PIO-oriented.  If they want DMA speedups, they can
do the mappings themselves (in cases where the driver didn't
do them already).

You _do_ feel comfortable with it?  I actually feel a bit odd, since
only one of the three driver types is really bitbanging.  And in fact
it still bothers me that the other two tie down a task, but that's
the price for reusing common infrastructure.
