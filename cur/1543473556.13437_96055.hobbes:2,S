Sorry about the offtopic question, but I need a Buslogic BT445C or an Advansys
ABP842/ABP852 vesa local bus SCSI controller for my network controller (Nx586).
These are hard to find, so pls mail me if YOU got one floating around.
I'm about building a SMP box, so I can't afford to change this network thing...
I'm currently not on the kernel list (shame on me 8-), so mail me directly.
