For PDP-11 trivia, see
http://www.telnet.hu/hamster/pdp-11/1120.html
where the question of MMU is answered thusly:
Interesting options: MX11 - Memory Extension Option: this enabled the usage
of 128 KW memory (18-bit addressing range); KS11: this option provided
hardware memory protection, which the plain /20 lacked. Both options were
developed by the Digital CSS (Computer Special Systems).

I think the 11/20 had an optional MMU, but I'm not sure. I have a vague
memory that the 8 had a map register, but that may be totally wrong.
UNIX as a useful OS begins with V6 which ran on the 11/40 and
up and these, for sure, had segments. Even V5 needed an 11/40. 
See sheets 16 & 17 in the Lions book.
But I'd love to see a reasonable argument as to why fork/exec would be
useful
on an mmu-less processor in the current state of the field.
90% of the semantics disappear.
