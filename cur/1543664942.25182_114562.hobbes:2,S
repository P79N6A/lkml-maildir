Hello all,
	Yet another quick question...is there any down side to using the
64GB option over the 4GB option if the machine only has 2GB of RAM onboard??
I would think this would be a performance issue?  Does the kernel only use
the translation table if it has to access any memory location over 4GB?
TIA
