Hi,
I am trying to create a catcher module that will provide a distributed layer over the file system. To do this I am using a kernel module to intercept and pre process the open system call. However I need to use some functions such as strlen() and memcpy() etc. When I try to compile the module it compiles fine. Without any errors. However when I insert the module using insmod <module name> I get an error:
catcher.o: unresolved symbol strlen
I am compiling the module using -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -DLINUX options. Is there some thing else that I have to do to use the strlen function. 
All the examples that I have been able to access use this function, but I cannot even make the examples work. I am using Kernel 2.2.12-20, gcc version egcs-2.91.66. 
Since I am not subscribed to the kernel development list .. can you please reply directly to me at u970066@giki.edu.pk
Thankyou.
Hasan Abbasi
