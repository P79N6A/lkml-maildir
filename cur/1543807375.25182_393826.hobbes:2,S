The FSF considers the normal MIT license (the original X license) to be 
GPL-compatible, but suggests not using the name (because there have been 
multiple licenses used at MIT).
The real problem is that it will taint the kernel, because the kernel 
won't _recognize_ it as being GPL-compatible. See module.c: function
"license_is_gpl_compatible()". 
For that reason, if no other, I would suggest changing it to
	"Dual MIT/GPL"
and adding that to the list of recognized licenses (the "Dual xxx/GPL" 
because by the time it is linked into the kernel it _will_ be GPL for any 
license that is compatible with the GPL).
Otherwise most kernel developers will discard any bug reports due to the 
oops showing the kernel as "tainted".
