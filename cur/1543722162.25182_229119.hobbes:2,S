The Makefile is derived from the one you posted, I just typed it by hand.
Therefore the variable names differ.
In the "Match-Anything Rules::" part of 'info make' the trick needed to
let 'make drivers/char/mem.o' work was described - thanks for reminding me of this issue.
The match-anything rule must be marked as terminal rule using double-colon - viola.
So the rule now looks:
%::
	\$(MAKE) -C \$(KERNELSRC) O=\$(KERNELOUTPUT) \$@
