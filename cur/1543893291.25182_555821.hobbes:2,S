Trying to image a system to a fuse filesystem is indeed fundamentally
broken. The problem is really that we have to make choices about what we
will and won't support.
We can have suspending to fuse filesystems, but only if we have running
userspace (which in turn implies either limiting the image to half of
memory or compressing a larger image as it's copied so that it fits in
the remaining space). We could have fuse from kexec, but then setting it
up will be... interesting.
We can have suspending to a network, but yes, we will want/need to be
selective about how network connections are handled.
I agree that the best solution seems to be selective resuming of devices
for writing the atomic copy. I had a patch to do that long ago, but it
wasn't a popular idea at the time. Since then I've focused more on
minimising the Suspend2 patch, so it's been dropped.

Or teach the driver stack about the difference/reset it. Remember that
even if you get a fresh network stack, you'll still be getting packets
for the old stack. Getting a new ip (assuming one is available) won't
stop other connections getting killed, either because we send resets
from the kexec'd kernel, or because they timeout looking for the old ip.
I can see that kexec does provide a nice, clean separation of context
from that of the kernel being hibernated. But it also deprives us of the
ability to easily use context in the hibernating kernel such as
encrypted devices and network connections & configuration. Do you have
some way in mind that could be utilised to overcome these limitations?

Doesn't the unmount do everything required to sync the data?

For Suspend2, I do something similar but simpler. If a page can be
loaded directly to the final address, do so. The only pages that need to
be loaded to another address and then restored are those that are used
by the loading kernel. We don't have to worry about copying pages back
in a particular order.

But you can't get what you said you wanted - a fully functional system
with a fully functional userspace isn't possible. You're running a
different kernel and can't safely mount filesystems that were mounted by
the first kernel. You'll have to set up a limited userspace that runs
from some sort of initrd/ramfs and will end up (so far as I can see now)
with similar restrictions to what we have now with uswsusp or suspend2's
userui. (Reads more... oh, I see you said that below :>)

As I argued above, both systems involve some degree of 'hack'. Kexec
only seems clean until you release that you wanted some of the context
you just switched away from.
