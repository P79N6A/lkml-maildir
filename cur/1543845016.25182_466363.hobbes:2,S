In that case there's another bug - we should write upper 16 bits to
addr + 2, not the lower ones.
IOW, the old code was
	broken attempt to write upper 16 bits to addr (ends up writing _lower_
16 bits)
	writing lower 16 bits to addr + 2
With this patch we get the first call do what it clearly intended to do
(unless it's a deliberate obfuscation from hell).  _IF_ we really want
to write the damn thing little-endian, the order should be reverted on
top of that.  I.e.
  	asd_write_reg_word(asd_ha, LmSEQ_INTEN_SAVE(lseq),
  			    (u16) LmM0INTEN_MASK & 0xFFFF);
  	asd_write_reg_word(asd_ha, LmSEQ_INTEN_SAVE(lseq) + 2,
			    (u16) ((LmM0INTEN_MASK & 0xFFFF0000) >> 16));
or, indeed, asd_write_reg_dword().
