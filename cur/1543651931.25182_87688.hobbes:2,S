And, as usual, if one would first READ the docs and then ask help, one would 
get a lot farther. Sorry bout this... :oP Just read the 
Documentation/filesystems/vfat.txt file, it says something about dmask (not 
present currently in the mount manpage) which made everything work again.
Another case of RTFM...

relationship that exists, people have to seek a way to survive.  If you
really care about the person, you do what's necessary, or that's the
end.  For the first time, I found that I really could change, and the
qualities I most admired in myself I gave up.  I stopped being loud and
bossy ...  Oh, all right.  I was still loud and bossy, but only behind
