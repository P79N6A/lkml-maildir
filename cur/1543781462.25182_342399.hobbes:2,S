Do you have VIA spec references to support this?  I had a quick
look, but couldn't find anything specific about which VIA devices
need the quirk and which don't.
As I understand it, you're not making a functional change here,
only getting rid of some messages in the log.  If that's true,
I'm hesitant about making more changes without information from
VIA.
