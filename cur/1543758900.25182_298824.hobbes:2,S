The atomic ops patch basically just avoids doing a pte_clear and then
setting the pte for archs that define CONFIG_ATOMIC_TABLE_OPS. This is
unecessary on ia64 and ia32 AFAIK.

Of course. But at least we would like to start as clean as possible.

Because the actual locking method is abstracted in a transaction
(idea by Nick Piggins, I just tried to make it cleaner). The arch may use
pte locking, pmd locking, atomic ops or whatever to provide
synchronization for page table operations.
