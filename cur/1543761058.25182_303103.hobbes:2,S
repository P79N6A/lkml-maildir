Once I get "nobh" working for both ordered and writeback mode - 
I will take out the option. Only reason why, you may
want "bh"s are for faster lookups. "bh" stores the get_block()
information, getting rid of it means - we need to do few more
get_block() calls when we need the disk mapping. 
We have seen small amount of "reads" when we are doing write-only 
tests with "nobh" option. I am not at a point, where I can quantify
the performance hit due to not caching the disk mapping info. 
Thanks,
Badari
