I agree that updating bootloaders is something you want to avoid. I'm
not however sure that I would call kexec-tools a bootloader...

Yeah, but the 33 patches are touching more than 9 instructions. =)

Agreed. I think your patch makes sense.

One binary to rule them all... If that is true, is there any simple
way then to extract vmlinux from the bzImage?
Thanks!
