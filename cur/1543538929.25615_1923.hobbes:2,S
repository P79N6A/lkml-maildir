Where it's marked as obsoleted ? I've not seen such warnings but I've SEEN
this field used by loadlin, for example. GRUB is not alone here.

This is not so simple. GRUB and/or loadlin can be fixed, of course. But I'm
not sure you can assume that kernel image size will be ALWAYS known for ALL
bootloaders except kernel boot sector (and kernel boot sector can be fixed to
be able to load such kernels anyway, BTW). It CAN be done, for sure
(installation procedure will calculate kernel image size and put it some
"safe place" for future use). Just I do not think it's feasible - this size
if calculated in kernel build process anyway - whay to duplicate work ?
