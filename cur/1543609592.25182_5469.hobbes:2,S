Apologies for the followup to the ancient post, but I've looked at the
differences between the serverworks.c in the current 2.4.14 kernel and the 
most recent -ac patch, and there are less than 30 lines changed.  Does this 
mean that the OSB4 support in the Linus kernel is now up to date?
I ask because I'm still having major problems with the OSB4 chipset on
2.4.14.  I've had to disable DMA completely on my boxes to avoid IDE errors
and fs corruption.  Does anyone know of a patch that addresses the issues
with this chipset?
