Hi,
There seems to be a problem in 2.6.10-rc1-mm4 with either USB storage (eg a 
pendrive) or hotplug on AMD64 (NForce3 chipset, ohci-hcd, SuSE 9.1).  Namely, 
if a USB pendrive is inserted into a socket, the kernel does not even detect 
it.  Here's what appears in dmesg after it's inserted:
ohci_hcd 0000:00:02.0: wakeup
Other USB devices (eg a mouse) seem to work normally.
Of course such problems do not occur on 2.6.10-rc1.  On 2.6.10-rc1-mm3 I've 
had this problem only on a dual-Opteron box, but on 2.6.10-rc1-mm4 I see it 
on a one-processor box either.
Greets,
RJW
