Subject: [PATCH] Fix fs/fat/inode.c when compiled with gcc-3.0.x
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello.  Currently when fs/fat/inode.c is compiled with gcc-3.0.x, there
are to lines which will cause a __divdi3 call to be used.  But on most
archs, there isn't currently a __divdi3 implementation in the kernel, so
FAT will no longer link (or load as a module).  The easy fix (pointed
out by Andrew Morton) is to replace the divide by 512 with a shift right
by 9, which has the same effect but doesn't use a divide.
This is vs 2.4.18-pre3, but applies to 2.5.2-pre9 as well (and probably
pre10 too..)
