It works indeed very well, and this driver actually uses the scx200_gpio module 
to do its work. But no it isn't enough, since this code ties into the existing 
LED framework and can do nice built-in functionality like blinking according to 
a timer, IDE disk activity, and a heatbeat-style load indicator. For free.
