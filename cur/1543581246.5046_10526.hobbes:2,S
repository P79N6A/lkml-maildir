The NR_TASKS is the maximum number of simultaneous running
processes in the system and has nothing at all to do whatsoever
with the uptime.
In 2.2.x NR_TASKS is set in stone during compile time.  If you
need more simultaneous tasks you must recompile with NR_TASKS set
higher.  You can set it as high as 4090 or so (read the docs).
In 2.4.x it can be set via proc at runtime.
Again, uptime means absolutely nothing.
