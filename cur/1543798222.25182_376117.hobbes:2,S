I am not referring to routes that are added by user-space, but the allocations
needed for cached routes stored in skb->dst in ip_route_input() path.

The only reason i made these macros is that i would expect this to a compile
time configurable option so that there is zero overhead for regular users.
#ifdef CONFIG_CRIT_SOCKET
#define SK_CRIT_ALLOC(sk, flags) ((sk->sk_allocation & __GFP_CRITICAL) | flags)
#define CRIT_ALLOC(flags) (__GFP_CRITICAL | flags)
#else
#define SK_CRIT_ALLOC(sk, flags) flags
#define CRIT_ALLOC(flags) flags
#endif
Thanks
