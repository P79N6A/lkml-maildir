Whose overloader ? I didn't write it ...
anyway, you can just put refcounts in your hijacked system calls; that is
the safe way to do it, and doesn't require any kernel patches, just extra
cost in the intercepted system calls.
e.g. :
my_syswhatever(...)
{
	MOD_INC_USE_COUNT;
	original_syswhatever(...);
	MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT;
}
Can you explain to me the race with this approach ?
thanks
john
