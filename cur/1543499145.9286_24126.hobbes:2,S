      In the simple case, setting mem=<foo> on the command-line should
      circumvent any probing.
      I've certainly not had any motherboard lock up on me when trying
      to do E820 (and this includes a lot of motherboards, including an
      ancient Pentia motherboard that doesn't support E820 or E801,
      but must have mem= specified if I want to access more than 64mb.)
      But my fancy memory patch isn't Mr. Early's fancy memory patch,
      and it may behave differently on machines that don't support E820.

      david parsons \bi/ On 2.0.28, it works without complaint.  On 2.2.9,
                     \/       weeeeeell, that's a different kind of story.
