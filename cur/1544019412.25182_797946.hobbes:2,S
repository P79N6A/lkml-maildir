On a BE 32-bit machine, the "output register" technically ought to be
"64-bit" anyways, since it's constrained to be the same as the 64-bit
"input register".  That means that you ought to make sure to set
*both* output registers appropriately, one of them being 0 and the
other being the 32-bit number.  I think that's the only answer that
actually makes any sense from a holistic code-generation sense.  So it
seems we are in violent agreement :-D.
