> optional non-interactive mode for cpu scheduler
i think the following scheme would work better:
 - introduce a new SCHED_CPUBOUND policy
 - return ->static_prio + 5 for such tasks
 - keep their timeslice based off ->static_prio
the point is this: such tasks would thus be automatically and
perpetually considered 'CPU hogs'. Applications cannot abuse this
mechanism because they get the maximum 'penalty'.
and as a bonus, no magic sysctl and inherently more flexibility.
(note that this scheme has advantages above nice +5 because nice +5
still has the interactivity stuff on which can create priority
fluctuations and may thus affect workloads.)
if you agree with this scheme, would you be interested in implementing
this?
