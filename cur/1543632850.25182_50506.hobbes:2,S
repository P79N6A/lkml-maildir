"Platform interface" is fairly true, but so was "general options". Neither of 
them is an obvious description of the functionality.
One idea that comes to mind is putting the power management config options in 
a "Power Management" section, then PNPBIOS in with the other PnP stuff, and 
so on (read: don't know were to put MPS yet, and don't know what $PIR is :) I 
understand that this means breaking up the ACPI config file, but that 
shouldn't be too hard. 
The general concept is that [c,C]onfig.in should be functionality based, not 
implementation based. ACPI parsing isn't a function, it supports a whole 
range of functions, which are quite different to the user.
