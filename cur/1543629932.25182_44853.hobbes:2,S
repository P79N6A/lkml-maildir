>(mkfs should be a frontend of libjfs)
As Christoph points out in a later note, libjfs really isn't the complete
utilities.
>Notice you have no error handling, etc. now?
Do you mean message handling or error reporting.  Forking JFS mkfs gives me
just as many return codes as libparted (pass/fail) and other than possibly
some messages, this is all EVMS requires.
>Also, the "total system" seems more complicated now.  (For example: how
are you going >to interface the resizer, so you can find out the min/max
sizes, etc?)
I agree that not everything fits well into fork/exec and it was not my
first choice, but it lets the fsim work with existing JFS utilities.  When
JFS implements expand (soon) they will have to deal with this.

Not that we didn't like it, just have way to many things to do.

I saw mention that you had done this.  Do you actually allow options to be
passed to the reiserfs utils, or is it still limited to defaults.  Last
time I looked the APIs in libparted didn't provide for this.  Without this
support the whole thing is rather uninteresting to us.
