I'm sorry but this is a load of bull ;)
New kernel revisions come with a new API. If we keep the old one around
forever that achieves two things
1) The kernel bloats up 
2) Nobody puts effort into using the new (better) API
A proof of 2 is the scsi error handling; the old one was kept around as
compat for the last 5 years and only 2 or 3 drivers bothered to use the
new one.
