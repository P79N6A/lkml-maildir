I believe that, in general, we want working fixup routines so the we don't
have to rely on the BIOS. That said, it's apparent that the ServerWorks
routines are broken. Fixing them is going to be troublesome, given ServerWorks
attitude towards releasing specs. It's on my list of things to try to sort out,
since some of the Netfinities I use are ServerWorks based.
