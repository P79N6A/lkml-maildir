that's an old comment, not a bug in the code - thx for pointing it out, i 
just fixed the comments - see the commit below.
Raw events are now done without using up negative numbers, they are done 
via:
 struct perf_counter_hw_event {
        s64                     type;
        u64                     irq_period;
        u32                     record_type;
        u32                     disabled     :  1, /* off by default */
                                nmi          :  1, /* NMI sampling   */
                                raw          :  1, /* raw event type */
                                __reserved_1 : 29;
        u64                     __reserved_2;
 };
if the hw_event.raw bit is set to 1, then the hw_event.type is fully 
'raw'. The default is for raw to be 0. So negative numbers can be used 
for sw events, positive numbers for hw events. Both can be extended 
gradually, without arbitrarily limits introduced.
