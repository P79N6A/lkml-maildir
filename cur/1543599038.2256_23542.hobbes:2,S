Personally, I'm on the "against Python" side of the argument, but I don't
think that this argument will hold up for very long.  I also remove just
about everything from a newly installed system _including_ compilers and
all devel tools.  Thus, I can't even compile a kernel on a "production"
box let alone configure it.
I build it on another box and either a) package it or b) tar it up for
"installation" on the target machine.
So this argument will not hold up very long, and I fear the Python
dependancy will be here to stay.  I'm just about over it. :)
Cheers,
Ryan
