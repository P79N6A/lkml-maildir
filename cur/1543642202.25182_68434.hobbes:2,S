Shared as wildly guessing from the implementation can only be accurately
estimated in one of two ways"
(1) maintaining RSS counters in the mm's updated on PG_direct split/coalesce
(2) walking the pagetables and adding up things with PG_direct clear
... both are too computationally expensive, so I deliberately changed
the semantics to "amount of mem mapped as MAP_SHARED".
Prior to this it was pure garbage because it checked page->count > 1.

drs and lrs both have problems.
drs basically requires either the pagetable walk here or a pte_chain
walk in a hotpath (set_page_dirty()/ClearPageDirty(), maybe pte_mkdirty()).
So I dropped its reporting entirely.
lrs is not semantically meaningful except to a.out, the existing code
uses hardcoded i386 values for it, and requires chasing down executable
format stuff to "get right".
trs is counting up memory that's mapped as VM_EXECUTABLE, which isn't
a big deal. RSS-style counters work for that just fine.
At any rate, while this may very well benefit small systems, it looks
like this isn't likely to make system monitoring feasible for larger
boxen, since I ran with it tonight and vmstat(1) and top(1) required 2
minutes or (much) longer to refresh during the big bad tiobench run. In
all likelihood I'll have to write a chardev to monitor the system.
Cheers,
Bill
