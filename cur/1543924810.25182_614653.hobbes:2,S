There's nothing to "verify" - the code works as intended, that's about
it.

I don't understand what you mean here. Can you please be more specific?

I'd rather not do that. The i2c core uses I2C_CLIENT_MODULE_PARM()
extensively and I don't really want to create dozens of additional
sysfs files for no good reason. If you want your own parameter to be
readable (or even writable if it makes sense - you didn't show the
code) I'd rather suggest adding a parameter to I2C_CLIENT_MODULE_PARM()
to let the caller decide what mode the attribute should have, setting
the mode to 0 for all the core parameters.
That being said, this whole set of macros in i2c.h is a complete mess
and with David Brownell's work on the i2c-core, using them should
become less necessary over time. Ultimately I'd be happy to get rid of
them completely.
Thanks,
