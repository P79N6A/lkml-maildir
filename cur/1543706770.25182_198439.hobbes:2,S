This patch updates UML to 2.6.3-rc2.  This breaks with my usual practice of
ignoring test patches.  However, when I updated my UML tree, I had forgotten
that my stock Linus tree was up to 2.6.3-rc2.  I took this as a sign from a
higher power that this was Meant To Be.
As well as catching up, there are some bug fixes and cleanups -
	modules should now work
	worked around a process start time bug
	fixed a bug which caused ps to divide by zero
The 2.6.3-rc2-1 UML patch is available at
