Yes.
(Although we have seen two examples of people that had their disks
connected to two CPUs, and needed an explicit flush.)
However, maybe you'll be disappointed with 2.3.37 or later.
These days umount_dev() calls blkdev_put(), which again
calls invalidate_buffers().
So, if /dev/hdb1 is mounted, or otherwise in use, then
blocks from hdb1 remain cached and operations on the raw device
are fast, as they used to be. But once /dev/hdb1 is unmounted
operations on the raw device become slow, each read has to
read all blocks from disk again.
