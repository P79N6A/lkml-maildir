Yes, Solaris does effectively this.
The scripts it uses are extremely fragile and have this nasty tendency
to believe a previous /devices instead of the hardware probe; worse,
you have to be able to mount /usr before they can run.  I'm sure that
equivalent functionality could be implemented in a more robust
fashion, however.
You'd have to have some way of getting the device list out of the
kernel in the first place - I don't think we have that yet.
