Yes there should not be contention on per cpu data in principle. The 
point of per cpu data is for the cpu to have access to contention free 
cachelines.
If the data is contented then it should be moved out of per cpu data and properly 
placed to minimize contention. Otherwise we will get into cacheline 
aliases (__read_mostly in per cpu??) etc etc in the per cpu areas.
