Can you give the CVS driver a try? Snapshots are available here:
http://opensource.creative.com/snapshot.html
The driver in the kernel is based on a CVS snapshot from last summer, the
problem may be fixed in CVS. Also, the CVS driver is a common driver for
2.2 and 2.4 (with some #ifdef), so it may be useful to see if it works for
you on 2.4.5 but not on 2.2.19.
