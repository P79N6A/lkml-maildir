I've had the same problem.
Lockups with 2.4.14pre1 + ext3-patch, sysrq not possible, HD led is on.
This is a 7IXE4 (AMD756), Duron 650, 384MB. 2 HD's, 1 CDROM.
I've noted that on startup I got "spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7", and the
machine locked hard on IDE activity (sometimes).
after observing the above message and others like 
	hda: timeout waiting for DMA
	ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma timeoutfunc only: 14
	hda: read_intr: status=0x51
	hda: read_intr: status=0x04
	hda: read_intr: status=0x51
	hda: read_intr: status=0x04
	hda: read_intr: status=0x51
	hda: read_intr: status=0x04
	ide0: reset: success
The I've tested disabling some options.
So far my best result was disabling APIC on UP (both - IOAPIC and APIC) -
so far I've had no more lockups.
Will test further, but this seemed to be the problem for me.
Regards,
Phil
