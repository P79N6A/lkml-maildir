vm_file a and f_count should be just handled by do_mmap().

				^^^^
grow should still be shifted right of PAGE_SHIFT I think.
I have not understood why PAGE_MAX_MEMORY_OFFSET & PAGE_MAX_FILE_OFFSET
are useful. We should check against too large offset or too high mmap in
the standard code, no? Maybe the offset limit is to forbid somebody to
create a too much large file even if the fs would permit? I am not sure if
it will be useful, at least if it's choosen at compile time and it's not a
sysctl.
