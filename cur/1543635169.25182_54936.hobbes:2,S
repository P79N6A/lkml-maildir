Hey, give me some credit :)
[asuardi@dolphin linux]$ /bin/pwd
/usr/local/src/linux-2.5.25/include/linux
[asuardi@dolphin linux]$ cat compile.h
/* This file is auto generated, version 1 */

I'm saying "doesn't happen for me" because it doesn't happen.
I've been compiling kernel as non-root (and well, of course
  installing as root) since 1996.
I'll admit I checked only the files I cut'n'pasted last mail,
  well let's be honest then...
[asuardi@dolphin linux]$ /bin/pwd
/usr/local/src/linux-2.5.25
[asuardi@dolphin linux]$ find . -user root -print
[asuardi@dolphin linux]$
See, *no* root-owned files here. Usual process is
  * save previous kernel's .config
  * zap previous kernel tree
  * untar the previous kernel tree in /usr/local/src
  * patch -p1 it with current kernel patch
  * create new kernel tarball
  * copy over saved .config
  * make oldconfig
  * make dep; make clean; make bzImage; make modules
  * (wait for next kernel patch ;)
