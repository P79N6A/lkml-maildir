	Exactly. And this is precisely what is happening here. The kernel headers
are small in comparison to the kernel. And external factors are such that
there is no other way to create kernel modules other than by using the
kernel headers.

	You are saying there are practical ways to develop kernel modules other
than using the kernel headers?

	Sure, and Lexmark could have allowed the TLP to be a million bytes.

	If that was true, then why didn't the court say to Static Controls
"calculate the toner left on some other printer, you cannot take the TLP"?

	Not at all. The only case where software is uncopyrightable is when it
claims to cover *every* practical way to make X do Y with Z. Just as the TLP
was the only (practical) way to measure the toner left in particular Lexmark
printers.
