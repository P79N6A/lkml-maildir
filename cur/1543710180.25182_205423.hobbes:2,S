Hi all,
what does the following message mean (during scsi init at boot)?
scsi0: Unexpected busfree while idle
SEQADDR == 0x1
It appears each second or so, and the system can't move on. It only happens if 
a specific drive is on the scsi bus.
Does it mean that drive is broken?
The scsi bios (during system bootup, before linux) detects all discs properly 
(including this one), and in the scsi bios i can "veryfiy media" and it 
doesn't complain.
Thanks in advance,
	Florian
