Since we'd need a way to distinguish between different "no subsys"
hierarchies, we could introduce the idea of a hierarchy name - i.e.
you would mount with options like -onone,name=foo, and this would show
up in /proc/self/cgroup as
name=foo:/path/to/cgroup
You could also name other hierarchies that did have subsystems
mounted, of course. This would allow you to mount existing hierarchies
by name rather than by subsystem set.
