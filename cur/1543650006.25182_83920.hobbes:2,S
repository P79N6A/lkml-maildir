OK, I went to your latest patches (just 1 and 2). And they worked!
You've fixed the performance degradation problems for kernel compile
(now a 14% improvement in systime), that core set works without 
further futzing about or crashing, with or without TSC, on either 
version of gcc ... congrats!
It also produces the fastest system time for kernel compile I've ever
seen ... this core set seems to be good (I'm still less than convinced
about the further patches, but we can work on those one at a time now
you've got it all broken out and modular). Michael posted slightly 
different looking results for virgin 44 yesterday - the main difference between virgin 44 and 44-mm4 for this stuff is probably the per-cpu 
hot & cold pages (Ingo, this is like your original per-cpu pages).
All results are for a 16-way NUMA-Q (P3 700MHz 2Mb cache) 16Gb RAM.

There's a small degredation at the low end of schedbench (Erich's
numa_test) in there ... would be nice to fix, but I'm less worried
about that (where the machine is lightly loaded) than the other 
numbers. Kernbench is just gcc-2.95-4 compiling the 2.4.17 kernel
doing a "make -j24 bzImage".
