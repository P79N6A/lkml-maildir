 When I wrote my script to sanitize, I was really surprised on which 
headers gets utilized and which ones didn't.. I have it down to the bare 
minimums in my script.
As far as glibc goes, from my people who are helping me the alpha 
architecture is the culprit there.
Do we have a list of what headers are "user-space" and which ones should 
not be "user-space"?
Also David W, let me know what I can do to help you out, a lot of people 
on my end want to get this working properly.
Who's maintaining util-linux these days, we probably should get a patch 
to them.
