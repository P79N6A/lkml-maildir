I have been and I am actively try, but it is hard when I try to be nice
and get hammered.

No you got the attitude line because of the direct personal slide against
me "And BTW: Isn't Andre's writing style very lovely ?"

Also, several messages earlier I pointed out that I had not documented the
feature because it was only attempted once, and only with 2 CFA's in a
bazar ata-bridge.
I then explained why the detection was failing and pointed where to verify.
After 3-5 attempts and I can not get the point across because the other
party keeps going off in different directions to do "what about this",
I finally pointed out facts that distrub people, and gave up on trying to
show/present/give the answer and offered to then enforce their beliefs of
reality.
So I state a few facts very pointed to get their attention again and that
is additude??

Exactly, however....
In the greater context of the your first message, what was your point, but
to inflame me with "And BTW: Isn't Andre's writing style very lovely ?".
If you and never made that comment, you would not have pissed me off.
Personal commentary is not desired.
Everyone know that I am not good at "documentation", and to slap/slam me
with mockery makes it all the less likely I'll consider trying again.
