And by that you add more header dependencies.
We have basically this situation:
	foo.h (struct foo; inline foo();) <-> bar.h (struct bar; inline bar();)
Almost every time we had such recursive dependencies, we simply rip one 
element out and put it into a separate header:
	foo.h (inline foo();)
		-> bar.h (struct bar; inline bar();)
			-> foo_struct.h (struct foo;)
Repeat this often enough and we end up with millions of small header 
files. Instead we can reorder everything a little and can do this:
	foo.h (inline foo(); inline bar();)
		-> foo_types.h (struct foo; struct bar;)
In your case don't put the inline functions into asm/mmzone.h and we 
should merge the various definition into fewer header files.

Sorry, I forgot to mention that you have to do this inside a kernel tree.
