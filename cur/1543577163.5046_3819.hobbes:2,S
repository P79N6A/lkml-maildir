Based on your suggestion, I looked again, and found that even though the kernel
sets VRA, the bit is lost when the driver unnecessarily resets the CODEC. The
patch below removes the unnecessary resetting of the CODEC. Nothing seems to be
lost by removing the resetting, and the driver in 2.2 series (where VRA works
fine) does not do this reset.
If we find that somebody needs this reset, we can move the VRA enabling code
after the codec reset code.
Anwar.
