Hi,
there is a known issue at least I know for the imbtr_cs after a debugging
session with a friend last weekend.
You might want to try
http://www.linuxtr.net/download/ibmtr-all.2.4.2-ac28.patch.gz
till there is an official patch for 2.4.4.
Due to some changes from 2.4.2 to 2.4.4 patch doesn't apply clean but
it's only few lines in rej-file you will have to fix manually.
Redhat unfortunately included this patch in their 2.4.2 rh7.1 kernel
though it is not in the official kernel confusing people even more.
