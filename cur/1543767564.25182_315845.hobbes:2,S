Hello,
I have two problems with udev:
1. When I use /dev as the root directory for udev, udev does not create
the device nodes for my serial interfaces (/dev/ttyS0 etc.) although the
necessary modules for serial device support are loaded. That prevented a
program that I use to autodetect connected mouse devices from
autodetecting a serial mouse.
2. To solve the problem mentioned above, I now use /udev as the root
directory for udev. When I now connect a USB stick to the computer, udev
does not create the device nodes for the stick (/udev/uba etc.)
Does anybody know how to solve these problems?
Kind regards
  Christoph
