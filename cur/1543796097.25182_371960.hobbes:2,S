Wohoo, you're great, that was it:
root     29547  0.0  0.3   7516   996 ?        D    Nov25   0:00 CROND
root     29548  0.0  0.3   7516   996 ?        Ss   Nov25   0:00 CROND
I stopped it, and loadavg is back to 0.
Now I have to figure out what CROND was doing...
Does ps always show processes in D state in CAPITAL letters?
After cron restart it is "crond", as usual.
