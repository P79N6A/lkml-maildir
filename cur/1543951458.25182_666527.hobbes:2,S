My boot scripts look in /dev/cpuset/tasks to find processes to move
into the system cpuset. So that would break them.

That can break existing userspace, so I presume PaulJ isn't in favour
of this change.

Apart from other cpusets that *are* mem_exclusive or cpu_exclusive.

The exclusivity problem, as above.
Which subsystems are you going to include in this boot hierarchy?
Userspace is going to have to be aware of the fact that there's a
cpusets hierarchy which might have to be dismantled if it wants to set
up something different.
