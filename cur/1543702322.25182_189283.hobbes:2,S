No, I meant what I said:  You have to tell many drivers to bring the interface
up before they will attempt (or at least report) link negotiation.
You do NOT have to give it an IP address or add any routes to it.
But, I don't know about your particular program, I just suspect it
is related to detecting link state.  I think tg3 detects link when
the interface is not UP, if you have some tg3 nics maybe you could
try with them?
