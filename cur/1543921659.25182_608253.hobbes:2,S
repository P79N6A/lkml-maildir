I explained at the head of this thread how and why Xen works in this
manner.  It's certainly a change from native execution; whether you
consider it to be a bug is a different matter.
But it turns out that leaving stray mappings around on pages which get
later used in special ways is a bad idea, and can manifest in all kinds
of random unpleasant ways.  Getting a clear error out of Xen is probably
nicest way to discover and debug this problem.
