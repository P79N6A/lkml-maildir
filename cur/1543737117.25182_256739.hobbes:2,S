I have found this on dmesg. Is it correct ?
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1
If not, how can I change the protocol ? A kernel bootparam ?
In old X, i used 'Option "Protocol" "MouseManPlusPS/2"'.
