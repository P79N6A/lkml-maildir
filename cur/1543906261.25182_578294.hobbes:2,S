Well.... That doesn't make a whole pile of sense unless the memory map
is not present. Looking at your boot log, we see this gem

Node 1 spans a region with a nice little hole in the middle of DMA32. In our
test machines, we wouldn't see a hole like this, at least that I can recall
so it would appear to work on some machines. On SPARSEMEM, sparse_init()
is responsible for allocating memmap for each section. In 2.6.22-rc6-mm1,
it allocated the memory if the section was *valid*. In 2.6.23-rc1-mm1,
it allocates the memory if the section is *present* due to the patch
sparsemem-record-when-a-section-has-a-valid-mem_map.patch[1]. Much later in
the init process, memmap is initialised based on spanned memory, not present
memory so initialisation will init memmap that resides in holes if a zone
spans that area in a node which is the case on this machine.  I think this
is why it kablamos - it's inits memmap that wasn't allocated because it's
not present and the suprise is that it doesn't blow up sooner. Please try
the patch below Torsten, thanks.
[1] yeah, I acked this patch and I had read through it. My bad if the
    patch below does fix the problem
