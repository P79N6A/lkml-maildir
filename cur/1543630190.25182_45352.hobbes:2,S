The effect (the timeout) can be caused by lots of things. Here it sounds
like the chip has locked up (more or less) since you need a cold boot to
recover. Why? Well ...
"Ivan G" has posted recently on via-rhine problems. For him it is only
that the driver stalls but not the need for a full reboot (IIRC).
Simple things you could try is to test some other variants of the driver:
 + Donald Becker's original
   
http://www.scyld.com/network/via-rhine.html
 + VIAs modified version
   
http://www.viaarena.com/?PageID=71#lan
If either works better then the next step would be to find out why (and 
copy those bits).
The diff between the VIA version and the other is large. I started looking
at merging what they have done to the in-kernel driver.
