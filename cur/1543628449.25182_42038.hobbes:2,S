Robert,
I don't have a suggestion for the locking yet, but rather a question
about the current code that you may be able to answer.  At the end
of set_cpus_allowed(), there is this block of code:
        init_MUTEX_LOCKED(&req.sem);
        req.task = p;
        list_add(&req.list, &rq->migration_queue);
        task_rq_unlock(rq, &flags);
        wake_up_process(rq->migration_thread);
        down(&req.sem);
After releasing the runqueue lock, what prevents p from moving to
(and running on) another CPU via the load_balance() mechanism
before the migration thread is scheduled?  I couldn't find anything
in the code to prevent this, and it looks like bad things would
happen if it did.  Of course, this assumes we are not running in
the context of p while calling set_cpus_allowed() for p.
P.S. Thanks for porting O(1) to 2.4!
