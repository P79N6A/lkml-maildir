Subject: QUESTION: 2.5 adds 1 to systats even for non I/O operations

I'm working in a daemon to control cpufreq and devices 
(
http://freshmeat.net/projects/cpudyn/
)
I've just noticed that kernel 2.5 always add one (1) to /proc/diskstats 
and /sys/block/hdX/stat "reads" field for ioctl's requests that don't 
generate data I/O. 
For example for checking the status of the disk (standby, active, sleep) 
or putting the disk in standby.
Is that correct? Do I have to take it in account always?
Thanks in advance.
