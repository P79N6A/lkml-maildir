You are right, the latest POSIX spec says
ERRORS
....
The readv() function may fail if:
[EINVAL]
The iovcnt argument was less than or equal to 0, or
greater than {IOV_MAX}
Apply this trivial patch, if you want the required
behaviour (see attached)

[Download message RAW]
In doing some testing on the project I'm working on I 
came across something that is causing a bit of 
confusion on my part.
According to readv(2) EINVAL is returned for an 
invalid  argument.  The examples given were count
might 
be greater than MAX_IOVEC or zero. The test case I am 
working with has count = 0 and I get return of 0 and 
errno 0 instead of the expected -1 and errno EINVAL.
Am I missing something?
Thanks!
Jim Hollenback
