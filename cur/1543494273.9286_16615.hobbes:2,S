If I want to do a DMA operation in a character driver, i believe i have 
to  use physical memory. ( by getting kvirt_to_phys() ). 
Is there a fear of this memory getting swapped out while the DMA 
operation is in progress.? If so, then there must be some mechanism of
locking the pages in the driver. What are the utilities available for
locking kernel virtual memory.?
