You don't need to have 64-bit jiffy for things like internal
timers, nor for uptime tracking.
Timers have well behaving constructs to use 32-bit jiffy quite 
successfully, and 64-bit values, especially atomicish, in 32-bit 
register-poor machines (i386) are damn difficult.
I do have a number of machines with 100 to 300 day uptimes, all
with "mere" 32-bit jiffy.  With 1000 Hz clock that means at least
one full wrap-around of jiffy.
