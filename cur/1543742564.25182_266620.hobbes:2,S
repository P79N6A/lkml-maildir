In short I think it doesn't make sense. There is enough existence
proof that you can write working 32bit emulation layers without
breaking any backwards compatibility. From my experiences with Egberts
patches there are also no compatibility problems.
You pay some cost for the conversion, but it tends to be not significant
(iirc from Egbert's results the non native case was not significantly
slower in ViewPerf)
Some people have attempted to design biarch ABIs in the past
for new interfaces, but more often than not they got it wrong in some
subtle detail and in the end you had to convert anyways.

Well, Egbert has and he wrote the code.
There is a working patch that you just need to apply, isn't there?

Again you don't need to break anything. You just convert the ABI.
As a short layman's introduction on how Linux 32bit compatibility
works see

(some details are unfortunately outdated for 2.6, but you'll get
the high level view)
