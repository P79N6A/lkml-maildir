 Am I to understand Linux does not have this built into the kernel already ?! 
 I have a patch that allows my Windows 98 box to run at 921600 on my 
Winbond chips. I don't know what overall performance difference it makes, 
but I know my connections seem a bit better for it :o)
 I would hope that Linux, and PPP, supports speeds up to 921600 in the 
next generation of kernels, though I know it's not an urgent thing to do.
 But with everyone telling me I need Linux to run as a proxy server, and 
running PPP, I can run faster speeds through Win98 currently, than it seems 
I can in Linux.
 Or is this something I missed ? ;o)
