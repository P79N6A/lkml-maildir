IP uses a crude hack to solve a similar problem (socket locking when
user context may possibly sleep with socket locked). When the
socket is locked on an incomming packet the packet is put onto a backlog
queue in the socket, on release_sock() time the backlog queue is checked
and the protocol handler is recalled with a special backlog_rcv method.
This is done in a {start,end}_bh_atomic lock to not violate any netbh
atomicity assumptions.
It is not pretty, but it works.
