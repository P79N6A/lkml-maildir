To add it to the context, you need to either change the context create API 
(I think no-go here), or add a new syscall just to handle that.
Doing it in the iocb gives finer grained setup, but can be more work for 
the user that wants to use it for all the iocbs.

Noone said that binary compatibility comes free ;)
I'm truly open to other ways of integration, but I thought that binary 
compatibility is the key here.
