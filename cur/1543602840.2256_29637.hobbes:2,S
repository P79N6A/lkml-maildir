Subject: Bug Report.  Compiling probs w/ kernel 2.4.9
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  To linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org:
  In trying to compile linux-2.4.9 with support for NTFS filesystem +w
perms.
Even though it is dangerous (supposevily) the kernel would still NOT
compile.
  So what I did to get it to compile was add '<linux/kernel.h>' to the
$kernel/fs/ntfs/unistr.c file.  Basically the only problem was that the
min(type,var1,var2) function was undeclared.
  Please make changes in the next release for future reference.  Thanks.
