Yes it is the 20268 chip.

I tested with up to 2.4.19, with the same results. Since there were no
errors and I couldn't find any relevant information in LKML, I didn't
bother to try 2.4.20 test or ac kernels.
This is interesting information, however it still looks very strange to
me, since this is not exactly brand-spanking-new hardware (Ultra 100 TX2
has been around for quite some time) and it does work just fine with other
boards (see below). Also, how come there are absolutely no
errors? Finally, could the motherboard's IDE chipset really have such a
huge impact on the performance of the PDC driver? I mean, after all, PIIX4
is a very widely used chipset, afaik.

I can assure you the controllers work just fine on some older QDI
Advance 10F motherboard (VP_IDE: VIA vt82c686a (rev 22) IDE UDMA66
controller), but there were others too.
And yes, I am talking about the same kernels: stock 2.4.18, .19, and Red
Hat's 2.4.18 kernels, among others.

I appreciate your insight & help on this. I hope my questions are not too
naive, but I was totally in the dark on this issue until now.
