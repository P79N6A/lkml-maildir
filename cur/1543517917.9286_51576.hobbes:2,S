Hmm... well, this means that we will have to do something like the
following in include/linux/types.h:
/* libc5 pulls its definition of uid_t out of this file, so it can never
   change when included by non-kernel code */
#ifdef __KERNEL__
typedef __kernel_uid32_t	uid_t;
typedef __kernel_gid32_t	gid_t;
#else
typedef __kernel_uid_t		uid_t;
typedef __kernel_gid_t		gid_t;
#endif /* __KERNEL__ */
Thanks for pointing this out,
