	I have one small thing to say on this whole patent spew.
	A long while ago Slashdot seemed to have a thing with some odd
	tidbits that where worth reading.  One of them was an article
	about some odd patents .. one of which as as recent patent on
	.. brace your self .. the wheel.  
	I can't for the life of me remember the patent number, but I
	remember reading it and fell over laughing that the patent office
	let something like it through.  Circular object connected to a
	center point via spokes.  Then it when on to define spokes, 
	everything from one or more spokes ( I interpretted their deffinition
	of a single spoke as a disk ).
	In light of that patent ..... it's all a joke somehow .. the patent
	office, the copywrites, the politics ..
	Monkeys throw shit around to mark their territory, humans throw
	ink around.  What's the difference?  it's all shit anyway.
