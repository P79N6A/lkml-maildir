No, thats kinda related but not the same issue, its more to do
with a truncate (or open(O_TRUNC)) followed by buffered writes
to an existing file, which some applications do, and how that
interacts poorly with delayed allocation (nothing is "overwritten
with zeroes", its actually just a "hole").
But I do intend to get _some_ work done today, so you can google
for a more detailed answer there if you're interested.
cheers.
