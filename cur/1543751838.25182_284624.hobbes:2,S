I'm saying that if we decide to do the debugging warning (and I think 
everybody is agreeing that we should), then we _will_ fix it by just 
grabbing the lock in all the paths. That's what we already did with 
do_mmap(), after all.
I suspect it's not strictly needed, but as Alan has said, even though 
nothing else can chaneg the vma's at the same time, it's the right thing 
to do to keep /proc reads happy (which _can_ happen) anyway. And more 
importantly, invariants are nice - to the point where it's good to follow 
the rules even if it might not be strictly necessary.
I just wanted to keep these two issues separate. I think it's one thing to 
fix a known bug, and another thing to add some debug infrastructure to 
make sure that it doesn't happen in the future. So I think the WARN_ON() + 
adding of extra locking is a separate stage from fixing the known problem.
