I'm guessing that you are including the comments people post on slashdot
to reach that 99%.  If you ignore the comments, slashdot is a fairly good
news site for news of interest to many Linux users.  E.g., I want a new video
card to replace my aging Voodoo 1, but the cards I'm interested in don't
have 3D Linux support.  As far as I can tell, the most efficient way to
find out when one of them *does* get 3D Linux support is to check the
slashdot headlines every day.
The posted comments are another matter.  They've now got a scoring system
running with moderators, and you can tell it you only want to see comments
above a certain score.  If you tell it you only want to see comments with
a score of 3 or above, you won't see much drivel.
