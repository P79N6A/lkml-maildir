When two different distributions ship different forks of
the kernel source, which differ in the arguments passed to proc_printf,
which one is right?  
There's no way to tell.  That's why saying "the source is the spec" doesn't cut it.
Also, the source is not a specification a parser generator can use.
A formal spec for /proc entries maintained by e.g. the LSB is needed;
it has to be separate from the source code (to avoid forking problems),
and it should be machine-readable (so we can build parsers from it).

Yeah, there's a general style that seems to work; it just needs to be
formalized.

I think they're good; they're a little bit like the XML tags you're proposing.

Something SNMP doesn't deal well with, either.  People seem to cope,
though.
