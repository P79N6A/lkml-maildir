I am porting Linux to a controller board using the Hitachi SH4 CPU. This
CPU can operate in either big-endian mode or little-endian mode. Since I
have control over the hardware and software, I can choose either one
freely. Is there any advantage to choosing one over the other for the Linux
kernel? Or should I choose based on other requirements?
