Its a tricky question, but I think on balance that Al's proposed fix is
the right one...

As you say, this field isn't actually used by anything. Its whole reason
for existing is to be forwards compatible with GFS1. So I'd be inclined
to accept the patch as proposed in order that as few filesystems as
possible will have the incorrect format. We'll make a note of this
problem and ensure that fsck can fix up the error and if we need to use
this field in future, then we'll take into account that there may be
some filesystems with the incorrect format number.
I think its fairly unlikely that we will need to use it in the near
future though... Its original purpose was to allow future changes in the
metadata format, but this is also allowed for by the mh_format field in
the common metadata header, so I'm not entirely sure why a second format
field was included in this structure (the directory leaf header).
Steve.
