My comment in security.h that I proposed [1] does not add any additional
constraints to the license that is currently on the file.  All it does
is explicitly state the licensing terms of it, so that there shall be no
confusion regarding it's inclusion in programs.  If you think this is
adding an additional restriction to the file, please explain.
If you were to include a GPL licensed user space header file in a closed
source program, of course you would be violating that license.  So why
do people think that since a file is in include/linux that the license
attached to that file is no longer valid?
Yes it is true that a variety of companies currently ship binary modules
for Linux.  And hopefully in the compilation of those modules they do
not include any GPL licensed header files.  I know some companies go to
great lengths to prevent this from happening.
thanks,
