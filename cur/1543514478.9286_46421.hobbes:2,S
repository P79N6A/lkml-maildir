Hello,
a few days ago when I build Kernel 2.2.13 with CDROM support I ran into the
problem that only the first two discs from my Pioneer DRM-624X 6 disc CD
changer got mounted. For the other four I got the "wrong major/minor node
error" for the /dev/sr* devices. Another think that I noticed is that the
Kernel detecting all the slots of the Pioneer CD changer it only outputted the
following for the first two slots:
Oct 24 20:45:43 marnie kernel: sr2: scsi3-mmc drive: 4x/4x xa/form2 cdda caddy
Oct 24 20:45:43 marnie kernel: sr3: scsi3-mmc drive: 4x/4x xa/form2 cdda caddy
When I switched from CDROM support in the Kernel to support in a Module this
problem vanished. 
Is this normal behaviour of the Kernel or a bug ?
Bye,
Henning
