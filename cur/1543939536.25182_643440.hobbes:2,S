Well, I guess this isn't really specific to x86; we could always 
legitimately not do a tlb flush after increasing permissions and leave 
the fault handler to clean up the mess where needed.  But I don't think 
that's necessarily much of a win; it's cheaper to just do the tlb flush 
rather than take a spurious fault, unless the faults are very rare.  If 
someone is doing an mprotect on a piece of memory (esp to make it 
writable), my guess is that they're going to touch that memory in the 
very near future.
The big win for this patch is avoiding cross-cpu tlb invalidation when 
changing kernel mappings.  mprotect doesn't attempt to do that anyway, 
and so can incur spurious faults on other CPUs.
