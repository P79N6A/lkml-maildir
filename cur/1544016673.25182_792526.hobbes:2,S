I'm sorry that I couldn't work so much, this week.
No much updates but I think all comments I got are applied.
About memcg part, I'll wait for that all Nishimura's fixes go ahead.
If cgroup part looks good, please Ack. I added CC to Andrew Morton for that part.
changes from previous series
  - dropeed a fix to OOM KILL   (will reschedule)
  - dropped a fix to -EBUSY     (will reschedule)
  - added css_is_populated()
  - added hierarchy_stat patch
Known my homework is
  - resize_limit should return -EBUSY. (Li Zefan reported.)
Andrew, I'll CC: you [1/4] and [2/4]. But no explicit Acked-by yet to any patches.
Thanks,
-Kame
