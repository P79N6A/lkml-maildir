Hmm, you're probably right for the hot unplug case.  However, there
are a couple of other related situations I've thought of in this context:
 - Module remove: userspace has PCI memory mmap()ed.  The module is
   removed.  Userspace still has access to PCI memory.  And if the
   module is reloaded, userspace still has access to the device that
   the driver doesn't know about, so the driver may hand off the same
   access to another process.
   The obvious solution here is to just take a module reference when
   userspace mmap()s the device.  However unprivileged processes can
   get direct access to IB devices, and it may not be so nice for
   unprivileged processes to be able to hold off module removal.
 - PCI error recovery (or internal device error recovery): if the
   driver detects a problem with the PCI bus or device, it might have
   to reset the device.  The most natural way to model this is as hot
   unplug followed by hot plug.  However we don't want userspace
   processes to keep their BAR mapping across the device reset,
   because the device is probably not set up to handle it right after reset.
   Really in this case at least, revoking an mmap() seems the cleanest
   solution to me.
Any further thoughts?
Thanks,
  Roland
