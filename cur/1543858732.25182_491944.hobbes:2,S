At which point, hopefully everyone in that courtroom besides the idiot
who says this knows the difference between a license and a contract.
If anyone doesn't, they can be referred to:
"5.  You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License."
The code is free, as in "redistributable at no charge as long as you
adhere to the terms of the license."
Your estoppel argument seems too confused between laches, promissory
estoppel and statutes of limitations to even make sense of, sorry.
