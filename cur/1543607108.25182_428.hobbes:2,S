First, get the most recent patch.  revision -3 is out now at
http://tech9.net/rml/linux
Try this.  Even better, try the 2.4.13-pre6 patch against that kernel. 
Either way, a possible race was fixed in the newer versions.
If you still have an oops, try to reproduce it without any binary
modules loaded.
