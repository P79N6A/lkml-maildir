There's a stupid logic inversion bug in rmap-10, which is
fixed in rmap-10a. Andrew Morton tracked it down about an
hour after I released rmap-10.
Basically in wakeup_kswapd() user processes go to sleep
if the pressure on the VM is _really_ high *and* the user
process has all the same GFP options set as kswapd itself,
so the process can sleep on kswapd.
	if ((gfp_mask & GFP_KSWAPD) == GFP_KSWAPD)
		return;
Thinking about it, rmap-10a doesn't do the right thing,
either, releasing patches at 4 am isn't the right thing ;)
In vmscan.c, line 707 _should_ be:
	if ((gfp_mask & GFP_KSWAPD) != GFP_KSWAPD)
		return;
This way tasks which cannot safely sleep on kswapd will
return immediately, allowing only tasks which _can_
sleep on kswapd to go for a break.
Oh well, time for testing and releasing rmap-11 ;)
regards,
Rik
