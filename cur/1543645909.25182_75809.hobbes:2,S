That's not right.  You can't use '||' in config language.  (Try it
with xconfig some time.)  You have to either nest if statements or
make use of precedence.  Documentation/kbuild/config-language.txt
doesn't actually specify the precedence, but in the Unix test(1) from
which it is derived, AND binds tighter than OR.  Thus:
  if [ "$CONFIG_SND" != "n" ]; then
     if [ "$CONFIG_SPARC32" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_SPARC64" = "y" ]; then
        source sound/sparc/Config.in
     fi
  fi
-- or --
  if [ "$CONFIG_SND" != "n" -a "$CONFIG_SPARC32" = "y" -o \
       "$CONFIG_SND" != "n" -a "$CONFIG_SPARC64" = "y" ]; then
     source sound/sparc/Config.in
  fi
This 'if' statement syntax has *got* to go.  I posted an incomplete
replacement syntax some time ago, but abandoned it because it appeared
Roman was almost ready to merge his new config stuff....
