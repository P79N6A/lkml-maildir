I recall to have sometime clicked on volume controls that weren't
hardware related, I don't pay much attention when stuff works, perhaps
it was the kde sound system doing it or something like that.
I would suggest doing the D->A only, then adding a basic hack to
g5 too ;), and then go back to the mini to do the gain emulation in
kernel space if somebody complains ;). Doing the software emulation
sounds quite orthogonal to the rest so it can be done later if needed.
Too loud sound is better than no sound.
