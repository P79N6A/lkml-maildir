	I kicked your address away few days ago, but damned if
	I remember what was the trouble then....
	One of:
	 - MX backup failure
	 - temporary loss of user database
	    "no such local user"  (YP/NIS/NIS+ glitch)
	 - vger's IP reverser failure causing indigestion at
	   your machine making it to yield 500 series error
	   codes on everything that VGER sends..
