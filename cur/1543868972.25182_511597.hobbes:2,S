Ok, it wouldn't be the first time some change that is supposed to change 
nothing does actually change something.
That said, one thing to worry about when doing bisection: the kernel 
configuration.
If you always just do "make oldconfig" or something, the kernel config for 
the thing you test will depend on the _previous_ kernel you compiled, and 
that is not always what you want. I've once had a failing kernel, did 
bisection, and it turned out that since I had gone back in time to before 
the option that caused the failure even existed, I had (by mistake) then 
compiled some of the later kernels without that option enabled, and called 
them "good". 
The end result: "git bisect" didn't actually end up pointing to the right 
commit, just because I had effectively lied to it.
That said, considering that you did get a commit that doesn't look 
entirely unlikely (and that clearly changes things that are relevant), I 
suspect you did actually find the right one.
