Hmm, I wonder if the report is valid?  Jan's patch would have the correct
side effect of disabling false positives (for RNG identification).
Be good to check that it actually used to work.
Having said that, Jan the datasheet recommendation is looser than your
implementation.  It only recommends checking for manufacturer code,
you check device code as well.  Do you know of any scenarios where that
would matter (I can't conceive of any)?
thanks,
