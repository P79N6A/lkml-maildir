Not that easy. It turns out that all idle tasks share the init_struct_pid, 
and if you add the attach_pid() outside the if statement, you only change 
the owner of the init_struct_pid to the last CPU to come on line.
I tried to allocate the pid, but by doing that it seems that the alloc_pid 
code will assign a number other than 0.  The changes needed to fork.c to 
make this work is quickly going beyond a trivial fix, where I do not want 
to become a pid container developer in order to implement it.
