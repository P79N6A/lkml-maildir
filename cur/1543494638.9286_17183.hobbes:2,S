According to me, Jörg has some good points, and we should carefully read
his discussion.
IMHO, sg should be redesigned to make it better suitable for cdrecord and
sane (the two main applications). I'm afraid, that in 2.2 not much can be
done, because we don't want to change the interfaces.
I don't know the sane authors, but I'd like to talk to them and to Jörg,
when making the 2.3 sg driver. I would really enjoy, if they would help to
design (and implement) an enhanced sg driver.
The midlevel SCSI code needs reworking too, but his is definitely a 2.3
project. High-Level is OK, apart from sg, acc. to me.
