ARM can't support atomic page table operations as such - the Linux view
of the page table is separate from the hardware view, and there's some
CPU specific code which translates from the Linux view to the hardware
view.
Looking at the actual patches, particularly pte_xchg-and-pte_cmpxchg.patch
combined with the above, the ARM solution would be to go back to using
non-atomic operations here (since we can't do this atomically.)  Also,
since the MMU will only ever read from the page tables, I don't think
we need to play any games with clearing out ptes before we replace the
value.
