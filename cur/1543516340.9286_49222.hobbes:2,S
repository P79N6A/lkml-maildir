NR_TASKS is enough for the number of tasks.  On 2.2 it cannot be raised
above 4090.
However, you might want to raise the run-time limits on numbers of open
files and inodes if the machine is going to be that busy: access
the /proc/sys/fs/*-max to adjust.  (You can just echo new values in
there at run time if you want to.)
