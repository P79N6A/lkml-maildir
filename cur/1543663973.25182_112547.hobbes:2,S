I don't own a sparc so I couldn't test it. But since the ptrace_readdata 
lives in the kernel tree for some time now and nobody is complaining about 
it I assume the sparc usage of ptrace_readdata is OK. I did test it on 
i386 and it works just fine.
When I look at the implementation of ptrace_readdata the dst (3th arg) has 
to be a pointer to user space; see: copy_to_user(dst, buf, retval). Only 
access_process_vm wants a kernel pointer. Anyway access_process_vm has 
some known issues, see:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.5/2.5.62/2.5.62-mm3/broken-out/ptrace-flush.patch
but it's getting fixed I hope.
As for that double buffering, it's already there. See usage of: 
kernel/ptrace.c:ptrace_readdata:char buf[128];
Please notice this double buffering can be eliminated as done in my 
exptrace patch, available at:
http://www.elis.rug.ac.be/~fcorneli/downloads/devel/exptrace-0.3.6pre7-2.4.20.patch
This speeds up everything... but the code needs some more testing, and a 
port to 2.5.
Regards,
Frank.
