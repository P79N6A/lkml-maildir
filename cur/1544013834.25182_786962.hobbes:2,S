adaptive locks have traditionally (read: Linus says) indicated the locking
is suboptimal from a performance perspective and should be reworked. This
is definitely the case for the -rt patchset, because they deliberately
trade performance by change even very short held spinlocks to sleeping locks. 
So I don't really know if -rt justifies adaptive locks in mainline/btrfs.
Is there no way for the short critical sections to be decoupled from the
long/sleeping ones?
