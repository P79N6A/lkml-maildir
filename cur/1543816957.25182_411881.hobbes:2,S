The original oops showed the path into bio_clone() originating from
crypt_alloc_buffer() in dm-crypt.c - and blk_recount_segments() is
oopsinig in page_to_pfn(), meaning that the most likely cause of this is
dm-crypt passing in a bio with invalid ->bi_idx and/or ->bi_vcnt. At
least they are not matching what ->bi_io_vec[] holds.
