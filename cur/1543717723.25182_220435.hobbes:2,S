The last time the "capabilities" thread reared its head a while ago, Andy made
a posting that pretty conclusively showed that the Posix way was totally b0rken
if you ever intended to support filesystem bits.  So if you wanted to ever have
a snowball's chance of supporting something like:
chcap cap_net_raw+ep /bin/ping
so you could get rid of the set-UID bit on 'ping', you had to toss the Posix
propogation rules out the window.  So we need to do either:
1) Toss the Posix out the window
2) Toss all the filesystems capabilities support out the window.
(I'm assuming that a suggestion that we make the choice a Kconfig option will
be met with the sound of many kernel hackers either retching in disgust or
screaming in horror ;)
