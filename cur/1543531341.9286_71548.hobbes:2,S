Same here (see my previous bugreport)... only I suspected something
because:
1) The first e2fsck generated the bug check (posted before)
2) The second e2fsck (after the bug check) shown all these strange
   errors (obviously said NO to all the fix prompts...)
3) Booting with another kernel (2.2 series) shown NO problems with
   e2fsck.
Only on Toshiba laptops ? mmmm....
