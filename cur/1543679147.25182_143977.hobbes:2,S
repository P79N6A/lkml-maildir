Currently testing on 2.5.73-mm2, with both patches (patch-O1int and
patch-granularity) plus HZ=1000. The result is quite impressive. Under
load, X still suffer a little lag and behaves a little worse than the
combo patch from Mike Galbraith + Ingo, but now XMMS doesn't skip even
when clicking a link inside Evolution.
Please, let me more time to work with this new patched kernel a little
bit more to see if I can find any strange issues.
