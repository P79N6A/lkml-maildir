slab.  Maybe you've been bitten by the quicklist leak.  If you're able to
patch your kernel then please try this fix:
commit 96990a4ae979df9e235d01097d6175759331e88c

    quicklists: Only consider memory that can be used with GFP_KERNEL
    Quicklists calculates the size of the quicklists based on the number of
    free pages.  This must be the number of free pages that can be allocated
    with GFP_KERNEL.  node_page_state() includes the pages in ZONE_HIGHMEM and
    ZONE_MOVABLE which may lead the quicklists to become too large causing OOM.

I note that this didn't have the stable@kernel.org cc.  Christoph, did we
deliberately decide not to backport?
