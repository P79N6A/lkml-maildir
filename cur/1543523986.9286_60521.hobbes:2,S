Desktops don't need ultra-low overhead at the levels being discussed
here.  Desktops don't do much scheduling at all.
They need good process _selection_ criteria for that maximum pleasure,
deep interactive experience.  (I.e. move the mouse and the pointer moves
in X even though you've got 3 parallel compiles running).
But a few cycles missed in the scheduler is not a big deal for typical
desktop uses.
