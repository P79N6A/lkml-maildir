Wasn't the AMD 7990 about 1990 8).

For small frames you need to copy/checksum the frame to keep the memory usage
sane. Take a look at tulip.c, lance.c and most other drivers that do this

It shouldnt take very long. netif_rx is a short queueing function
From the drivers we have I dont think it will be an issue.
