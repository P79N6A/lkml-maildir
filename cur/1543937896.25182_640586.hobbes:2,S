I assume that all new rpc calls are created by the lockd thread itself
(which also calls nlm_shutdown_hosts(), which guarantees that there
can't be someone about to make an rpc call using the clnt we're
destroying here?
By the way, any idea what the nlm_shutdown_hosts() call in exit_nlm() is
doing?
