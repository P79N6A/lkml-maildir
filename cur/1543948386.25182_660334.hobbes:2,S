allyesconfig should be able to capture any text savings that this patch 
offers.

My x86_64 defconfig with gcc 4.0.3 had no difference in text size after 
applying your patch, yet the same config on gcc 4.1.2 did:
	   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
	5386112	 846328	 719560	6952000	 6a1440	vmlinux.before
	5386048	 846328	 719560	6951936	 6a1400	vmlinux.after
