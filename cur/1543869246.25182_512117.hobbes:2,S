But that's because it is *WINDOWS*, which, unless specifically granted to you, 
does not include a transfer of the right to distribute in *ANY* form. Every 
PC manufacturer that wants to distribute Windows on new machines they produce 
*MUST* sign an agreement with M$. As I have never seen any of those 
agreements I cannot state what the terms are and whether they are different 
for each company holding such a license.
And unless you've signed a licensing agreement over the source code to 
Windows, you're more than likely to have another lawsuit on your hands for 
possessing it.

Eh? Complete *object* files so that after making changes and recompiling they 
can relink it? Umm... I don't know about you, but that makes me laugh. What 
is the purpose of providing "Complete Object Files" to everyone if they are 
just going to recompile and relink the library?
Yes, I know this quite likely refers to any object files (or other binaries) 
that are part of the library but not part of the source. (and *are* required 
for the library to be completely functional)

Copyright *doesn't* extend to compiled code. It cannot, because compiled code 
is a machine generated translation. A machine generated translation isn't the 
product of a creative process. And you can also provide all the routines 
normally provided by the support library. This means that the support library 
is *NOT* a necessary part of the system.

Yes, but in both cases the result is *CLEARLY* the result of a creative 
process, and said clipart, unless it is in the form of an entirely machine 
generated image, is a separate work (and one resulting from a creative 
process) that you are using under license. (Unless said clipart was released 
into the public domain)

Again you are confusing a mechanical translation process with a creative 
process. But it doesn't matter, in this case. The binary form of a program 
*technically* falls under the copyright on the source code - a mechanical 
process that translates a copyrighted work into another form *cannot* remove 
the original copyright.
But said modules have clearly defined and limited purposes.

Yes.  And you've noted that yes, they can be replaced. Which means that they 
are also not a necessary part of the system. 
Claiming that any library (that can be replaced), either dynamically or 
statically linked to a program, is a requirement isn't smart. That also means 
that claiming a program that uses those libraries is a derivative work is 
bull.
Further, if such a library or module has an interface that must be accessed in 
one specific way, then said interface cannot be copyright. (As has been 
pointed out to me several times in other threads on LKML)

True. But in those cases there isn't the gray area that exists surrounding 
claims of a Flex generated scanner or a Bison generated parser being 
derivative works of either program.
