Yes, but the different i2c chip drivers all check for the class setting
to be correct before they really do anything, right?

Yes, and that is what you should check for.  It's a bug if any of the
non-DVB i2c drivers probe devices with the .class set to
I2C_ADAP_CLASS_TV_DIGITAL.  Fix that and you should be fine, right?

Yeah, right now it's up to the chip drivers to be honest.  If you want
to implement a change to do this instead, I'll be glad to apply it.
