Hi, Greg:
This code makes no sense to me:
> int device_create_file(struct device * dev, struct device_attribute * attr)
> {
> 	int error = 0;
> 	if (get_device(dev)) {
> 		error = sysfs_create_file(&dev->kobj, &attr->attr);
> 		put_device(dev);
> 	}
> 	return error;
> }
If the struct device *dev, and its presumably enclosing structure,
can be freed by a different CPU (or pre-empt), then get_device
does not protect it. It can be freed before get_device is reached.
Buf it not, and the caller has a reference, then the call to
get_device is redundant.
How is this supposed to work?
