Hi Arjan,
first, highmem is fixed and the original patch you have from me is good.
second, Daniel Phillips gave me some feedback into how to figure out the
VM error.  I am working on it, although just the VM potential --
ReiserFS may be another problem.
third, you may be experiencing problems with a kernel optimized for
Athlon.  this may or may not be related to the current issues with an
Athlon-optimized kernel.  Basically, functions in arch/i386/lib/mmx.c
seem to need some locking to prevent preemption.  I have a basic patch
and we are working on a final one.
