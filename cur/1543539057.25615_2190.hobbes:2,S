Hi Andre,
I found the problem - probe for ide4 caused switching HT-6560A chip 
to wrong non-operational mode. Address of its control register is 
0x3e6, it is the same as alerrnate status register of ide4.
It is bad that it is not possible to use request_region() function to 
reserve this io port to ht6560 because chipset drivers are called too 
early.
And why older ide patches worked for me? Because of some bug they 
caused that ide1 to ide5 showed "ports already in use" and so were 
not autoprobed.
So ide4=noprobe works. I tried it even before, but I had too long 
kernel command line and this directive was truncated. And as linux 
did't booted, I didn't see the truncated line. Anyway - what is the 
maximum length of kernel command line? My was truncated to 46 usable 
characters, isn't it too few?
Regards,
Petr Soucek
