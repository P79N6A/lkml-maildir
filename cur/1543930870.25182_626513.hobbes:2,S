No - seems to be fine with just origin.patch and git-net.patch.
Just for good measure I then reverted git-net.patch and applied 
git-netdev-all.patch instead, and still wasn't able to trigger the reboot or 
console message, no matter how hard I tried.
I guess for now I'll sit on it, and if it appears in the next -mm it'll probably 
annoy me enough and inspire me to dig deeper (or, "guess" deeper, given the lack 
of direction as to where to even begin).
