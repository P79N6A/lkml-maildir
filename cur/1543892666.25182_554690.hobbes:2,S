If anyone's wondering what's happening:
The UTF-8 representation of the character Ø consists of the two bytes
  0xC3 0x98
In the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings where every character is represented by 
one bytes this corresponds to two characters:
In ISO/IEC 8859-1 the byte 0xC3 represents the character Ã resulting in 
the (harmless) display of this wrong character.
But in all the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings, the byte 0x98 is the 
_control code_ "Start of String".
Therefore, if we want start using UTF-8 anywhere into the kernel, we 
must ensure that all applications correctly convert all characters 
if running in a non-UTF-8 environment.
I'm not sure that's worth the hassle.
