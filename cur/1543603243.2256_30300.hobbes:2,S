Hi,
I have 2 servers which might need to go unattended for
several weeks at a time. They are currently running
vanilla 2.4.10 but my confidence in this (SMP) kernel
has been shaken when it spontaneously froze solid the
other day while I was viewing a web-page in Mozilla.
(And all I was doing was using the scrollbar on an
already-loaded page! No oops messages, no chance to
use Alt-SysRq, nothing.)
All that the servers would be doing would be
connecting to the Internet periodically using PPPoE
and DSL (with NAT), forwarding emails and performing
various CPU-bound tasks. They should both have ample
available memory and should not need to swap much, if
at all.
Does anyone have any kernel recommendations /
counter-recommendations, please? One server is SMP,
the other is UP, and both are Intel architecture.
Cheers,
Chris
