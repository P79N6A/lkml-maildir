Rik, I tried a simple test, building a kernel in a 128M P-II-400, and when
the load average got up to 50 or so the system became slow;-) On the other
hand it was still usable for most normal things other then incoming mail
which properly blocks at LA>10 or so.
I'll be trying it on a large machine tomorrow, but it at least looks
stable. In real life no sane person would do that, would they? Make with a
nice -10 was essentially invisible.
Maybe tomorrow the lateest -aa kernel on the same machine, with and
without my own personal patch.
