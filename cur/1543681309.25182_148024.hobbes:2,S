Hello!

This is not quite true. sk->write_space() is called only after write
queue is full, and it is exactly one wakeup until the next overflow.
But, actually, yes, it is right observation: one wait queue for all
the socket events is painful. Note, that with current poll() improvements
are suboptimal, tcp_poll() does not know _what_ this poll polls for,
so it has to stand in all the wait queues. The same thing kills lots
of possible improvements.

No, really. POLLHUP=POLLRDHUP&POLLWRHUP, plus POLLHUP is unmaskable event.
Yes, SVR4 screwed up its semantics in such extent that it is mostly
meaningless.
