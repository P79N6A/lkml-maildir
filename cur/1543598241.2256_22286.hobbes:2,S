	I don't know enough about fbdev vs. the old PC VGA console 
to know whether those ioctl's are available for fbdev.
	As far as I'm concerned, loading fonts by user level programs
would be even better than by loading modules, although, I think that,
when trying to move a facility from kernel to userland, people are a
lot more willing to try that change if the kernel-based way is still
available, but normally just compiled as modules that people gradually
stop using.
