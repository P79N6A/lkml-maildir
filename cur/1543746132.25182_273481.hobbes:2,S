well, at least I think everything related to input subsystem should be
inside /dev/input/ and I always did so because it seems more logical.
I guess udev is also using /dev/input/uinput, but I'm not sure.
As soon I finish some user space stuff I'm working on I'll add more
documentation on uinput.txt and check devfs and udev.
