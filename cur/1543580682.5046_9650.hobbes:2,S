Hi,
I discovered that lvm seems to have a problem
with compaq raid controllers - the partitions
don't have the normal names like /dev/sda1,
but instead names like /dev/ida/c0d0p1 -
lvm seems to works OK, but lvmdiskscan freaks...
lvmdiskscan works normally on other systems,
which have conventional disk controllers.
This is OK -
case: /tmp
(tty/dev/pts/1): bash: 623 > lvscan
lvscan -- ACTIVE           "/dev/lxlvm/lvm1" [3.12 GB]
lvscan -- 1 logical volumes with 3.12 GB total in 1 volume group
lvscan -- 1 active logical volumes
This is OK too -
case: /tmp
(tty/dev/pts/1): bash: 622 > df
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/ida/c0d0p1        1007928    220124    736604  24% /
/dev/ida/c0d0p8        2015904    251196   1662304  14% /home
/dev/ida/c0d0p7        1007928       240    956488   1% /opt
/dev/ida/c0d0p9        4031856   1660664   2166380  44% /usr
/dev/ida/c0d0p3        2015920     61768   1851744   4% /var
/dev/lxlvm/lvm1        3225352   1888308   1173204  62% /disks/backup
But this is not in agreement:
case: /tmp
(tty/dev/pts/1): bash: 625 > lvmdiskscan -v
lvmdiskscan -- reading all disks / partitions (this may take a while...)
lvmdiskscan -- filling directory cache...
lvmdiskscan -- walking through all found disks / partitions
lvmdiskscan -- /dev/ida/c0d0p1  [    1000.06 MB] free whole disk
lvmdiskscan -- no valid disks / partitions found
lvmdiskscan -- please check your disk device special files!
Hope this is of use -
