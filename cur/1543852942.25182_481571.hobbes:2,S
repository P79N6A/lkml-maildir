It might depend on the age of your computer.
Microsoft mandates the presence of an APIC implemented per MADT and all 
hardware interrupts connected to an IOAPIC for all servers and desktops 
with a "Designed for Windows XP" sticker.
This implies more or less that a working APIC is present in all
non-laptop x86 UP systems manufactured during the last 5 years.
