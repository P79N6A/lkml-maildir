I'm going to second this message on behalf of CMU Electrical & Computer
Engineering, and I suspect I speak for the School of Computer Science as
well (they're still trying to stabilize their i386_linux3 --- yes,
substantially the same one as described for MIT, as is our i386_linux2g
which predates the naming convention; see warlord@mit.edu's message as to
why).
Linux is *not* interface-stable.  Not as it is needed in the real world.
If the "free software" mantra is going to take priority over usability,
quite a few of us current Linux users are going to have to look for a
supportable OS.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
