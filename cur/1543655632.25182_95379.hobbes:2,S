Subject: [BK prob] - bogus cset

I'm an idiot, in the process of optimizing the logging code (so you modem
users send less data, a big deal in Europe), I put a test cset into the
main tree at bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5 and a pile of people pulled
it.  
Could you please do this:
bk findkey 'lm@work.bitmover.com|ChangeSet|20021211000341|36093' ChangeSet
If that returns nothing, you're fine.  If it tells you a revision, then
if that is the most recent revision, just do a 
	bk undo -fr`bk findkey 'lm@work.bitmover.com|ChangeSet|20021211000341|36093' ChangeSet`
and you're all set.  If that isn't the most recent revision, i.e., you merged
against that, send me an email and I'll straighten out the tree.
Sorry about this, it won't happen again.
