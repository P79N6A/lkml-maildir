This reminds me -- does xntpd/ntpd really need to lock it all of its
pages? 
VmSize:     1060 kB
VmLck:      1060 kB
VmRSS:      1060 kB
VmData:      300 kB
VmStk:        12 kB
VmExe:       152 kB
VmLib:       548 kB
That's quite a bit of memory on small (8MB and below) machines, which
really means xntpd isn't suitable if the machine is to do something
else....
