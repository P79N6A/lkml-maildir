I think this is likely not directly a sparsemem problem.  It probably
just shows symptoms earlier.
See the attached patch.  It attempts to detect and handle hugetlb pages
in the smaps code.  However, I think one of the root issues here is that
bad_pmd() triggers for hugetlb pmds.  I audited a few places where it is
called, and at least a couple of them can't have hugepages handed into
them, like fork().
