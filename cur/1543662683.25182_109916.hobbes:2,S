"If you don't play nice, I'll take the toy (Bitkeeper) away from
you". You start to sound like a quite popular american president now.
Maybe you should send inspectors to all BK users to be sure that they
don't use it to develop weapons of mass^W^W^Wnon free software.
Linus, please consider this a request to drop BK _right now_ and
change to another SCM for kernel development. I hate working under a
threat.
Larry: Sorry, I know that this posting is really rude but I try to
point out the danger of the path you're heading down to.
