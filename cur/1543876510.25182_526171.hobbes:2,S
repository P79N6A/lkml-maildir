That one is a psychological thing. :-) People like blue backgrounds, because a
green or red one would not really fit as a bg color for Midnight Commander,
pine and your-favorite-editor. So you choose blue because it fits nicely. (See
http://img81.imageshack.us/img81/8858/blueqj6.png
 for an example, and compare
with

 and
http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/8470/greennq2.png
 for counterexamples. Even
a bright blue (0,0,192) is still better than red/green, the reason being that
blue is much less percepted by the eye than green or red. You will find various
formulas on the 'net that will convert from color to grayscale - these formulas
have the 'perception' levels, which are, summarized, 76*r, 151*g, 26*b on a 255
scale.) Personally I find the regular blue (0,0,170/0xA0) a little too bright
so I turned it down to 0x90. Adjust for your preference.
