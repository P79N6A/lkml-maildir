That's "Multics" and while I agree that C is nicer than PL/I, the latter
is _not_ an assembler or autocode. Multics was written in HLL.
As for the "greater social good" (or world domination, for that matter)
- excuse me, but quite a few of us couldn't care less. It's a decent UNIX,
there is a lot of things making that kernel more interesting than other
ones and it's fun to work on. FSF is -> that way, if you need the "social
good" crap - take Hurd and enjoy the featuritis-ridden bloatware.
