i've compiled my kerel (2.2.9) with the Matrox mystique frame buffer so i
get a cool boot logo when the kernel is booting (it's the only reason :-)
but i want to change the image.
now, the picture lives in include/linux/linux_logo.h (in the kernel sources)
and appears to be either an XBM or XPM, but is it? What can i use (apart from
vi and a lot of trial and error) to change it?
