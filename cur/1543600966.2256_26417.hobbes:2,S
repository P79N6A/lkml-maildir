A colleague purchased a number of A7V133s all of which exhibited seg faults
in make and gcc. make reproducibly seg faulted in vfork(). This was
with 2.2.18 kernels compiled for i586. We next tried a 2.4.8 kernel
built for i686 and the problem persisted, though less reproducibly. The
kernel reports 'Applying VIA southbridge workaround', but it looks
like we need another fix.
Most of the BIOS options had no effect, but changing the 'PCI latency'
setting from 32 to 64 seems to have fixed it, fingers crossed.
