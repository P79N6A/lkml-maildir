ok, i have a "LATITUDE C600",
i'm useing current debian woody, not redhat.
i didn't do anythign special. the xfree86 config is handwritten, not
generated with the debian tool (which wasn't working at that time).
will send you a copy in personal email (and anyone else interested).
my kernels are recent 2.4.* kernels, usualy the latest (currently
2.4.18) with some patch (freeswan, swsup or acpi, whatever i'm looking
at).
i have only one laptop, but at the university i dealt with several others,
but never had a pink-screen-logout--requires-reset-problem.
best regards, andreas
