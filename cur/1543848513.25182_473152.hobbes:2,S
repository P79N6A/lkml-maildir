Subject: nfs file locking broken

I tried to upgrade from 2.6.16.27 to 2.6.17.13.  I have also tried
2.6.18.1.  I discovered NFS file locking no longer works between a Linux
client and an OpenBSD server.  For example, gtk-gnutella gets the
following error:
06-10-14 15:50:19 (WARNING): fcntl(8, F_SETLK, ...) failed for
"/home/edison/.gtk-gnutella/gtk-gnutella.pid": Permission denied
gpg hangs waiting for a lock for ~/.gnupg/random_seed
