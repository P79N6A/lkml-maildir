No, please don't do this. There is no function at all in the cpufreq core 
which may be called with CPUFREQ_ALL_CPUS as arguments. Well, there had 
been, many months ago. But it really shall not be defined or used anywhere 
outside the 2.4. proc-intf any more.
Now, wrt the ppc-cpufreq driver: benh's 2.5. tree includes a much more
updated version than plain 2.6.0-test1 -- Ben, can you push that to Linus,
please? Also, please change the line 
 	freqs.cpu = CPUFREQ_ALL_CPUS;
in do_set_cpu_speed() to 
	freqs.cpu = 0;
which is the way it should be done now.
