The writeback code isn't in the picture with this workload - there's no
dirty pagecache around.

Not sure what that means.
The problem is trivial to reproduce.  Killing these lines in shrink_list():
			if (laptop_mode && !sc->may_writepage)
				goto keep_locked;
makes it go away.  Something's out of whack in there, and the removal of
the free swapspace test exposed some prior problem.  I'll poke at it some
more.
