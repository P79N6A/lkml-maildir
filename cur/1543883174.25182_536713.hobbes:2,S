IIRC, there is a PAL call to flush the whole cache (but that is quite a
heavy call).  Though you really don't need to be doing this.

Caches on Itanium are physical.  So, it doesn't matter what virtual address
you use to flush a cache line, cache line containing specific physical
memory will be flushed.  For the cases where you have virtual caches,
update_mmu_cache is the API to use.
