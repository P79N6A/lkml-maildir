Of course it requires API stability... as I said ``API and data 
structure stability should be something in mind''. I really meant that 
API shouldn't change suddenly. And from the moment in which API are 
stable, still having even different implementations, *then* (not before) 
probably ABI can be taken in consideration.

I don't want to even think about an incredible coincidence of having a 
_working_ ABI with different API... different function calls, different 
data structures, different behaviors, and still working in binary mode...
