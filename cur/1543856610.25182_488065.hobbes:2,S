Sigh.
NAK again!
You are taking the wrong approach.  If you must collapse the multiple optimised
implementations, then you must choose the spinlock approach.  cmpxchg() may
have be implemented by spinlock on some archs, and so your approach is really
not optimal in such cases.  Not all archs have cmpxchg or any way of doing an
equivalent.  Please don't hold FRV up as an example, because as I've mentioned
before, it does not have an SMP-safe implementation of cmpxchg for multiple
CPUs.  FRV only has XCHG that you can really rely on.
I have another CPU (MN10300/AM33) that we're working on too, and that only has
BSET/BCLR - single bit XCHG basically.  That can't even do the UP emulation the
FRV does.
And if you've got LL/SC equivalents (alpha, mips, powerpc, arm6) then CMPXCHG
is also suboptimal.
If you've got XADD, then CMPXCHG is also suboptimal.  CMPXCHG may have to spin.
Yes, you say "I know people will want to scream because it costs 3 more cycles
on some obscure architecture", but that includes some i386 arch CPUs.  OTOH,
XADD isn't much cheaper there.  On some i386 CPUs, the spinlock algorithm may
be the best.

The asm-mutex stuff is not that nice either.

Which are?  As far as I know there haven't needed to be any fixes in the rwsem
stuff for some time.
So, what problems are you actually trying to fix?

But not all CPUs can be optimised the same way, even within the same arch...

Then use the spinlock version generically.  You have to take the spinlock in
the slowpath anyway.  This then gives you a maximum number of readers of of
2^30-1.  By trading another bit, you can remove the requirement to also
contemplate the emptiness of the list of waiters.

Actually, the code isn't anywhere near as difficult to read as the mutex code
or the spinlock code.  The fastcall "junk" is quite important wrt the i386 code
and permitted a small speedup (though if we compile with regparms=3 nowadays,
then the advantage is actually bypassed).

Why?  I think the fastpaths should be inlined if lockdep is disabled, but Ingo
broke that.

Which is what?  And why do you assume mutexes and spinlocks are the correct way
to do things?  They may result in slightly smaller code, but they end up with
slower code.
