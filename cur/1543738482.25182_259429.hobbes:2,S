This is *exactly* why I choose to use swsusp2. There is a marked
difference in the maintainer's approach to these kinds of problems.
The net result is that swsusp2 has worked for me very well for many
months now: I have been suspending and resuming happily for several
months, with exactly 0 swsusp-caused crashes or failures.
BTW, on a related note, I believe there is too much acceptance for
crashes and failures in the Linux world recently. Take an example: I can
bring down any of my machines (kernels 2.4 or 2.6) in less than 10
minutes just by plugging in and unplugging USB devices. There is
something fundamentally wrong with the USB subsystem if it is possible
to do that.
