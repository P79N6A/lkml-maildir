	Indeed. I disagree with Russell:

	Not all devices, especially the network cards, are simply a set of
offsets (though it's a bit academic, as it all turns into numbers in the
end!). We should be using the compiler to help us. It's good at working
out how to multiply and add to get the right offset - provided we give it
all the information in the first place - i.e. the necessary structure
packing
Can we all agree that the following is at least _acceptable_?
e.g.
struct rx_desc {
	s32 base;
	s16 buf_len;
	s16 msg_len;
} __attribute__((packed));
...
struct rx_desc * rx_ring = ioremap(0xC0000, size_of_ring);
...
writel(value, &rx_ring[i].base);
writew(value, &rx_ring[i].buf_len);
...
iounmap(rx_ring);
My apologies for completely balls-ing up the initial patch. Now I
understand a little more about ioremap, given the above is acceptable,
I'll try to fix some of the drivers directly.
