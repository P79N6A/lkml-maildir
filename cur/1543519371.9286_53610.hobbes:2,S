I think they are all public anyway. The major 2.0.x bugs left are
o	Obscure race causing very occasional tcp socket free while in use
	causing crash in sock_wmalloc and similar
o	"BUG copied...." in TCP (harmless)
o	Cannot configure shared memory limits to avoid overcommits
o	TCP blind spoofing vulnerabilities
o	CLONE_PID needs stopping from user space
o	Incomplete locking for threaded apps (notably versus file locking)
o	TCP memory leak somewhere. I think Chris Wedgewood may have found this
o	PS/2 can load and then fail to init. Accessing psaux then crashes
o	Can't boot on an old old Cyrix/TI CPU (ditto with 2.2 I think). The
	code turns on the cpuid flag but doesnt then check to see if CPUID
	is now available so reboots when it calls cpuid
o	Quota races
o	Very occasional NFS crashes with "evil packet..."
o	IDE geometry bugs as 2.2 had 
Needs lots of driver updates (aic etc). I have archived mails about these
including patches in some cases
