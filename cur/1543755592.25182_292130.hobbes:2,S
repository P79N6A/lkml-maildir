ide_pci_register() is needed because of legacy ordering assumptions
(from BIOS and/or Windows) in case of many PCI IDE devices.  If there
is no possibility of other IDE PCI devices on your architecture it is safe to
call pci_register_driver() directly (see ide_scan_pcibus() in setup-pci.c).
BTW IDE part of the patch looks OK.
