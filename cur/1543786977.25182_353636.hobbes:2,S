Yes, it calls __mod_timer() now.  That's quite bad and
the debugging check should be re-added I think.
Is there some reason why we want add_timer() to behave like
__mod_timer(timer, timer->expires)?  I can't see any...
So perhaps we should add the simple BUG_ON(timer->pending) check to
include/linux/timer.h:add_timer()
add_timer_on() does this check btw....
