I think this makes a huge amount of sense for drive vendors, because it means
they can sell drives to people who don't like opening their machines.
On the other hand, I don't think it makes any sense to buy them.
For home use, maybe, but I can't think of anything worse to administer than a
network with hundreds of piddling little 20GB disks all over the place.  People
learned that having lots of diskful workstations was a complete pain to
administer; having lots of anonymous network disks scattered in cupboards all
over the place is even worse. 
I agree that things like fibrechannel are a waste of time and money, and
there's no reason to not use 100/1000Mbit ether for disk attachment (if there's
problems, fix them; don't invent some new expensive technology).  Similarly,
STP looks like a very good way to talk to drives.  However the way the drive
companies are doing it now (with their heads full of "maybe we can get more
than 1% margin!") is just crazy.
In other words, something like STP is exactly what they want, along with some
way of aggregating all these disks into a single logical unit as far as storage
and administration goes.  Which means diskless (stateless, interchangable,
robust) Linux boxes doing NFS/SMB <-> STP and as many networked drives on the
back side as you want.
