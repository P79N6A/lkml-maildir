Hello,
this patch exports the clear_queue_congested()
and set_queue_congested() functions located in ll_rw_blk.c
The functions are renamed to blk_clear_queue_congested()
and blk_set_queue_congested().
(needed in the pktcdvd driver's bio write congestion control)
(have the bits set with set_queue_congested() any use?
seems they are never used by anyone....)
