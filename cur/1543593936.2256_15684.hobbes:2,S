Hi,
I found this bug in dev.c
It happens if register_netdevice is called before net_dev_init which can
happen from init functions,
when device drivers are compiled into the kernel.
The dev->refcnt will go up to 2 ( it should be 1) unregister_netdevice will
usually  loop forever
waiting for the refcnt to drop to 1 when an attempt to unregister is done.
The printk in the bootmessages early initialization of device <blah> is
deferred is evidence of this behaviour occuring.
The small patch is below ,hope it is okay for you.
(See attached file: dev.c.2.4.5.patch)
