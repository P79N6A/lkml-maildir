In May there was a posting Thorsten Hirsch and a patch reply by Dmitry 
Torokhov that did not help Thorsten.
I have exactely the same problem, and other people too. There's a thread on 
this topic with a more detailed problem description at:
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?s=&postid=1004645#post1004645
The problem was pested regarding to Kernel 2.6.6, but an upgrade to Kernel 
2.6.7 did not help me. My problem is even much worse:
 - The touchpad sometimes hangs and jumps.
 - Hitting on the touchpad does no more click the first button.
 - When I connect an external keyboard, the cursor somtimes jumps
   around like crazy and clicks around like fool, even if I don't
   click anything, but only move. When I then touch the keyboard,
   the mouse becomes normal for a while - on SuSE kernel 2.6.5,
   since. Since upgrade to kernel 2.6.7, does not become normal
   any more.
 - Sometimes the keyboard fails too, that means the without touching
   any key, a character is continually written, e.g. hundreds of "5"
   appear on the xterm. If i hit a key, a completely other character
   is printed, but not once but endlessly repeated.
 - Killing and restarting the X Server does not resolve the problem,
   reboot is the only thing that works!
It's really bad, I can't work anymore since I upgraded to SuSE 9.1 and kernel 
2.6...
Kernel messages:
A lot of during use of touch pad:
- psmouse.c: TouchPad at isa0060/serio2/input0 lost sync at byte 1
- psmouse.c: TouchPad at isa0060/serio2/input0 lost sync at byte 4
When using the external mouse and the mouse jumps around (repeated 2-3 times):
- atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program like XFree86, might be 
trying access hardware directly
- psmoouse.c: bad data from KBC - timeout
