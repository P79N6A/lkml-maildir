Hmm, my CPUID vs /proc/cpuinfo comment seemed somewhat controversial.

In priciple I would agree, but CPUID is a lot easier to use than to open and
parse /proc/cpuinfo, specially when the format of the latter changes...

In this case, I'd REALLY like to know whether the feature is emulated or not.
Imagine a kernel emulating MMX instructions, with a 10x performance loss.
My MPEG viewer has builtin support for MMX and non-MMX capable processors,
with the non-MMX version 2x slower. On a non-MMX processor, we'll still
be a lot better off using the non-MMX rendering libs.
In other cases it may not matter, only the user can tell.

Yes, this is a problem. There are two alternatives:
- hpa's cpuid driver lets you execute cpuid on a specific processor
  (but it's an optional driver, so you can't count on it)
- Something like Solaris' processor_bind() which lets a user-space application
  "bind" itself to a given processor. AFAIK, Linux doesn't have this :-(

User-space can also check vendor/family/mode/stepping values and choose not to
trust certain announced feature flags. No big deal.

A recurring theme: asymmetric MP boxen :-(
Yeah, you and Andi are right, asymmetric MP boxen require kernel support.
I didn't consider that case...
