Subject: [PATCH 5/5] ring-buffer: reset timestamps when ring buffer is reset
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/21/342

From: Steven Rostedt <srostedt@redhat.com>
Impact: fix bad times of recent resets
The ring buffer needs to reset its timestamps when reseting of the
buffer, otherwise the timestamps are stale and might be used to
calculate times in the buffer causing funny timestamps to appear.
