dentries just keep the path travelled by hard links to get to the file in
memory for fast future access. So if you have, say:
   dir1  dir2
    |     |
    .     .
    .     .
    .     .
     \   /
    somefile
and you referenced somefile by the path through dir1, if you monitor dir2
you won't notice the change. There is no on-disk data to trace back through
all the directories that reference the file, and reading all of the
filesystem's metadata to find this out is ludicrous (ever seen fsck(8)
taking an hour or so to make much the same?).
