Hello,
I've tried to build a kernel with modular IDE drivers (CONFIG_IDE=m)
and got unresolved symbols during make modules_install. The reason was
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640=y which has to be set to 'm' when you try to
build IDE drivers as modules.
I think the IDE chipset bugfix/support should depend on
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE to force building them as modules if the IDE driver
is build as a module:

+      dep_tristate '  CMD640 chipset bugfix/support' CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640 $CONFIG_X86 $CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE
The same holds for nearly all other drivers in the ide
subdirectories. Unfortunately I'm not familiar enough with the sources
and dependencies to provide a complete diff.
regards,
Jean
