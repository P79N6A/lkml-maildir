I'd about had it with my new box freezing up for longer than my P166
used to. I finally made time to scratch the itch ;-)
The downside is that I can't tell as easily when people are looking at 
the web-camera in my office and I need to smile for 'em (or look busy
for my boss) *winks*

The only thing is compatability with some existing V4L supporting
software that doesn't grok read(). It's not a high priority here, and
it's taken me nearly 2 months to make time to make these small 
changes ;-)

Any quick pointers on this? (Pointer to parts of other drivers that
are 'nicer' would be great). I'm going to add a second CPU to this P2
soon, so I will have some (minor) incentive to improve things here.

Aye. Oh...Didn't mention in the first mail - the patch stretched the
detection limits slightly. Just enough to be (mostly) detected on my
machine first time.
I half considered adding a 'passive' module flag, that would let you
toggle between the current scheme, and the potentially printer
breaking Connectix scheme (reset and try to handshake). I don't have a
printer hooked up though, so it's on the 'possibly nice to make time
for' pile.
I guess I missed '5. V4L2 compatability' too.
Best Regards,
Mark
