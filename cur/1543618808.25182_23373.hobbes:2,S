Khmmm please enlighten me ...

Why? Simply use for example type 'char' as boolean value. Let's say
0 means false and other value is true.
So:
if (x) printf("true");
or
if (!x) printf("false");
Why do you want to overcomplicate?
Even:
x=a>b;
if (x) printf("A is greater than B");
ONE thing which is best in C is the less strictly type rules eg you
can use 'char' to store eg c='A' or c=2.
Hey guys, C was designed to write an OS it's not something other ...
