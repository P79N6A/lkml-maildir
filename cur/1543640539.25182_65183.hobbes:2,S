Subject: Linux 2.4.20-pre4 blows away Xwindows with Matrox G400 and DRM

It was OK with pre2, went straight to pre4.
Upon running startx I get a fraction of a second of activity before
I'm plunged into an instant reboot.  Inspection of the XFree86.0.log
shows the first and last lines as:
XFree86 Version 4.2.0 (Red Hat Linux release: 4.2.0-8) / X Window System
(protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6600)
Release Date: 23 January 2002
        If the server is older than 6-12 months, or if your card is
        newer than the above date, look for a newer version before
        reporting problems.  (See 
http://www.XFree86.Org/
)
