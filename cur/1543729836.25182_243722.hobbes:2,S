Borislav Deianov (borislav@users.sourceforge.net) has recently posted a
similar Thinkpad ACPI driver on the Thinkpad hardware list, and it has a
number of success reports.
He has apparently taken off on holiday, but you can find the code here:
http://bkernel.sf.net/tmp/ibm-acpi-0.3.tar.gz
Perhaps you should talk to him about merging the code, and then working
together to get this into the kernel?
I believe that he has also been in touch with the ACPI development list.
Anyway, it is good to see Thinkpad specific ACPI support on the way --
being able to software control my Bluetooth adapter would be nice. :)
Regards,
        Daniel
