hehe, yep, in fact there is an ewrk3 patch I still need to merge :)

october freeze was for major features, not minor incremental tweaks...

I respectfully disagree...  I think if these sort of FIXMEs show up in 
menuconfig, you're not only cluttering up menuconfig, you also moving 
past the level of programmer to the sysadmin/power-user level.  That 
seems like it would generate more bug reports than useful work.
About the only thing WRT menuconfig I would be ok with is commenting out 
majorly broken drivers until they are fixed...
