Actual the i386 defconfig does this:
[root@grendel linux-2.6.0-test1]# grep -e VT -e HW_CONSOLE  -e SERIO -e 
INPUT_AT_KEYBOARD arch/i386/defconfig
CONFIG_SERIO=y
CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=y
# CONFIG_SERIO_SERPORT is not set
# CONFIG_SERIO_CT82C710 is not set
# CONFIG_SERIO_PARKBD is not set
CONFIG_VT=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_HW_CONSOLE=y
[root@grendel linux-2.6.0-test1]#
  However a "make oldconfig" on a 2.4 .config doesn't pick this up.  In 
fact it appears to be impossible to select  CONFIG_VT  CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE 
in make menuconfig.
