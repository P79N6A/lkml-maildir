And you're not? Damn.

You know, I believe you're right. I needed the de-skewing patch for
something unrelated and it seemed that it opened the possibility for
the following optimisations (ie. because we no longer touch a page
after its refcount goes to zero).
But actually it doesn't matter that we might touch page_count, only
that we not clear PageLRU. So the enabler is simply moving the
TestClearPageLRU after the get_page_testone.
So I'll respin the patches without the de-skewing and the series
will become much smaller and neater.

You've never bothered me about that until now...
Thanks for the feedback!
