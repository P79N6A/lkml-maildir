If you notice, the above method has only minimal changes from
your mmap3 stuff, except without needing kernel support. One
thing to remember, though, as there _is_ a very clean method
to do this from userspace, therefore you are not likely to
get much sympathy on this list.
I suggest you try adding a new hotpatch thread to your code,
as above, then use it to implement the mmap3 and other tasks
necessary for live patching instead of in kernel space.
Cheers,
