Frankly, yes.
In my opinion, it makes even more sense for modprobe to do the work
itself, and cache the info in /lib/modules/`uname
-r`/modules.{dep,alias,symtab}.
I was always planning on doing this after we got rid of the modules.map
files, but that never happened due to reluctance from other people to
transition, and I didn't fight them.
Cheers,
Rusty.
