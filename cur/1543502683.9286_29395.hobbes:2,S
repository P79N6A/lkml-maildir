I am getting sparse reports about problems with linux-kernel
list not sending any messages to .AU or .BE since about 7th
of current month.   Some people do mention that although they
don't receive  linux-kernel,  other groups do reach them.
I want to know,  is this  .BE  blocking still going on ?
Also, have we been able to unjam .AU ?
If I don't hear anything from .BE, or from .AU within next 48 hours,
I must presume the problem persists.
I am far out from the office, but fortunately these IETF confrences
are always arranged with excellent network connectivity :)
