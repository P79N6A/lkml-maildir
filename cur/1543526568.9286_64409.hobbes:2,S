Hello,
This discussion started on Bugtraq on the 'DDOS Attack Mitigation'
thread;
there seem to be quite a bit of confusion as of the purpose rp_filter;
I've
talked with some admins and many were relying on rp_filter to filter
_spoofed packets_.  Basically only firewall rules seem to do the job
well.
I was initially suggesting that Linux provides a way to drop outgoing
packets
with source address that doesn't match any local interface, say using a
lookup
table that could be occasionally sorted according to an interface's avg.
usage;
i was told that rp_filter drops spoofed packets; i was able to route a
spoofed
packet well with an unexisting source address through my router with
rp_filter
on an firewall ingress filtering off; the packet arrived to destination.
Please forgive me if this was alerady discussed; I think at least the
documentation
should be a bit more clear and explain that rp_filter does not protect
against
IP spoofing at all, and does not do ingress filtering.  It's obvious and
somewhat
documented, but some admins still rely on rp_filter to do ingress
filtering, and
that might be part of the problem.
From 2.2.14's Configure.help:

And from networking/ip-sysctl.txt:

I must be missing something, but isn't rp_filter just making some admins
thinking spoofed traffic won't go through?  I think an optional feature
that would
do source address verification against lookup table, given enough
optimization,
could be a big help in reducing DOS attacks from Linux boxes.
I know, it's the border router's job - but working w/ an isp that does
colocation,
we can't trust the LAN and most harmful attacks of course come from the
inside, also
think of boxes with a direct Internet connection.
