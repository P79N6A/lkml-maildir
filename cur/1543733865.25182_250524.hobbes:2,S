Most of their code is not GPL'ed. It does have a COPYING file, but that
looks like a BSD license to me. The only (implicitly) GPL'ed part is
the ALSA patch.

It's not a GPL driver, the kernel part contains a binary object file
(drivers/amrlibs.o) so I don't see how it can be included in the main
kernel tree. OTOH, at first glance only the PCI driver needs that
binary blob, the USB driver doesn't.
