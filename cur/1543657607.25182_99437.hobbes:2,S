Yup.  A BK database is actually a BK repostory with an SQL layer on 
top of it.  So all of the stuff you can do with BK you can do with 
BK/Database.  We can export changes as patches, as flat files, as
associative arrays in perl, take your pick.

Cool.  I've already tracked down an SQL hacker who is willing to contract
with us to write the scripts to get the data out of your Bugzilla database.
He said that I need to ask you to do this:
	shut down the mysql database
	grab all the MySQL files and stuff them in a tarball
	turn on the mysql database again
Then he can set up a mysql instance here and start hacking on the scripts.
How's that sound?
