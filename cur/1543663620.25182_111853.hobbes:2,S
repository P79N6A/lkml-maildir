The other nasty is that if you install Rusty's rpms for the better module tools, and
then install a Red Hat kernel errata your errata kernel will not boot because the
Rusty tools replace insmod.static with a tool which only works standalone on 2.5. Its
not a big deal since most people who build 2.5 kernels build their own 2.4 ones too,
and you can fix the initrd by hand, but it is one to know about.
