Sorry I still don't see it.
original code did sb_stor_bulk_transfer_sg(..., &srp->resid, ...)
but sb_stor_bulk_transfer_sg does the:
 int partial; <- stack uninitialised
 sb_stor_bulk_transfer_sglist(..., &partial, ...);
and then unconditionally sets *residual = length_left;
I do not see an "error legs" case in sb_stor_bulk_transfer_sg().
I have just cut and pasted the !use_sg from sb_stor_bulk_transfer_sg names
and all
