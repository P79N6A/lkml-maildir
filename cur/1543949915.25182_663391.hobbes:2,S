	Your new goto labels "error" and "success" (instead of "out"
and "out0") clarify the code enough to justify your removal of the
comment block, so that's all good.  My only question is why you've
changed res from int to long, given that you've corrected my misguided
"P.S.":

	You're right.  My mistake.  Sorry for causing confusion.  But,
based on what you've just said, it doesn't sound like you need to
change res from int to long.  Is there some other issue I'm missing?
	Anyhow, if you want to do these changes together in a single
commit or separately, I'm fine with it either way.
