I'm using a "web based email"...
What I suggested was, why don't use a web interface in order to submit a
patch, something with forms to fill, with the description of the patch,
the body of the patch, the results of the test done...
Using something like this I think you could have a nice repository of all
posted patch.
Howevere, this is _only_ my idea, pleas don't reply to this mail with others
satiral comments. 
Ciao,
Ciak
