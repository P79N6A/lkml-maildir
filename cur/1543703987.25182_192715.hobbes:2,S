At least the array stuff I'm using in my drivers, to handle the
"multiple tv cards in one box" case, like this:
  static unsigned int card[] = {[0 ... (SAA7134_MAXBOARDS - 1)] = UNSET };
  MODULE_PARM(card,"1-" __stringify(SAA7134_MAXBOARDS) "i");
  MODULE_PARM_DESC(card,"card type");
So having that in 2.4 too would be nice.
I have also two more questions:  How can I specify default values != 0
for insmod options using the new macros?  How specify help/description
texts?  Using the MODULE_PARM_DESC() macro or is there something new too?
