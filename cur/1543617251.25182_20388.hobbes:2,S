I agree with all of yours. IMHO, the proposed scheme for 2.5 is plain
bad. It will require an initrd (initramfs, or whatever), and force
kernel installation to be more difficult. The performance overhead
sounds like a major downside, epsecially when currently people know
what hardware they have and build things into the kernel accordingly.
Between this and CML2, my mental image of 2.5+ is starting to look
very grim.
