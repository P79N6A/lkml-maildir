Right. If I take my .config, get just non-"n" entries, get rid of the
CONFIG_ at each line, then gzip(1) the result, I get 1515 _bytes_. Less
than the rounding error in a module, can be expanded on the fly with
existing infrastructure.
Sure, it makes sense to have .config around somehow for some rather
specialized cases, but kludgeing on some such functionality for a very
niche use just stinks, IMHO.
