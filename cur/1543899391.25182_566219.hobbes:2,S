And this must be called sleep, deep sleep or something like that. Because
preparing for sleeping takes place, sleeping itself is a process, life
requires. Waking up, staying all day fresh and active is the needed goal.
Thus, whole freeze/ice idea was dead-born, IMHO :)
WRT this, busy-loop _waiting_ that was called sleep, usleep or
nanosleep is another wrong-named concept. I imagine somebody after one
minute sleep :)
