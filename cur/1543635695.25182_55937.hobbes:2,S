This is currently x86 limited and soon will be recored to the modern api
that is so desired.  It will also maintion 100% backwards compatablity.
It will tested and run in various environments and combinations.
Lastly all of you can trust that I will not destroy your data because of
an October deadline.
For all of you out there complaining I write crap code, well if you saw
the download list of the web logs, without this announcement that in
itself would make the following statement.
Bring back the old and lousy, the new and improved is only a shiny sticker.
Since I really have had little success in submission of patches for 2.4,
I can play with 2.5.  The best part is I can glean from the mess that is
good, and make a final solution which shall work.
Cheers,
