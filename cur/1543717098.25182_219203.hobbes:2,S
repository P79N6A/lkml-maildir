What functionality are you talking about?
We don't care about out of tree kernel code (be it GPL or Proprietary).

You don't understand what the patch is really about.
This is kernel stack not the user-space one so
this change can't brake any application.

It doesn't change any kernel interface visible to user-space
and stack hungry kernel code needs fixing anyway.
