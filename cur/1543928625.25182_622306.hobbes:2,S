Do you have a patch that shows the type of interface you would like to
see?  Like James stated, if you do not participate in the development
process, we have no way of knowing what you even want from the kernel.
What has kept you from submitting your code for inclusion in the main
kernel source tree?
Right now, your customers void their support warranties if they run your
software, as it can not be supported by the distros as an out-of-tree
kernel module.  I'm sure your customers would like to not have this
problem.
thanks,
