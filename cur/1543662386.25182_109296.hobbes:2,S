As most of the x86 drivers have been converted now, it looks like
it'd make more sense to conditionalise this on architecture, and
move the remaining x86 drivers over to the helpers (longrun/longhaul).
It just strikes me as silly that we have a config option that when
disabled could end up showing no chip drivers when the conversion
is complete.
