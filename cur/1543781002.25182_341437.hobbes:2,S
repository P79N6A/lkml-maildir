Marcelo and LKML, here is a rediff of the simple version of the patch
from Alexander Pytlev that I forwarded previously. The whitespace in his
version had been munged.
I haven't tested it, but it looks like it should resolve the problem
Alexander reported that mount parameters after iocharset, map and
session are ignored.
This should apply against current 2.4 git.  I took a peek into 2.6, and
the code there has seems to have been completely restructured.
