How can a kernel program lock down memory pages for a user program in linux?
for eg: in solaris one could call as_pagelock() etc once the handle is known
from the process info and calling
bp_mapin(), and unmapping would be the opposite.
how would one do this in kernel for a user program. under linux.
Cheers,

Plug-and-Play is really nice, unfortunately it only works 50% of the time.
To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.
