Even with this patch it still seems that most balances are still timer based, 
because we still call load_balance in rebalance_tick.  Granted, we may 
inter-node balance more often, well, maybe less often since 
node_busy_rebalance_tick was busy_rebalance_tick*2.  I do see the advantage 
of doing this at idle, but idle only, that's why I'd would be more inclined a 
only a much more aggressive idle rebalance.

What does "failed" really mean?  To me, when *busiest=null, that means we 
passed, the node itself is probably balanced, and there's nothing to do.  It 
gives no indication at all of the global load [im]balance.  Shouldn't the 
thing we are looking for is the imbalance among node_nr_running[]?  Would it 
make sense to go forward with a global balance based on that only?

If this is the patch I am thinking of, it was the (attached) one I sent them, 
which did a light "push" rebalance at try_to_wake_up.  Calling load_balance 
at try_to_wake_up seems very heavy-weight.  This patch only looks for an idle 
cpu (within the same node) to wake up on before task activation, only if the 
task_rq(p)->nr_running is too long.  So, yes, I do believe this can be 
important, but I think it's only called for when we have an idle cpu.

OK, we wont get into a pissing match :)  I just wanted to base the scheduler 
decisions on data related to the hardware NUMA properties, not the cpu count.

Yes, at some point we have to.  We cannot have two different schedulers.  Non 
numa should have the exact same scheduling policy as a numa system with one 
node.  I don't know if that's acceptable for 2.6, but I really want to go for 
that in 2.7.
