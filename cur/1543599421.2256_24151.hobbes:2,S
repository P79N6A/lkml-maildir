What if:
1) We rename the new min() as type_min(),
2) We bring back the old min(), and
      HERE is the _important_ part:
3) Have min() bitch and moan real loud whenever the two arguments
       aren't of the same type.
That way we can have it both ways: a min() that is easy and convenient, and a
min() that can handle two arguments with different types.
