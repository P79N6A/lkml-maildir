After upgrading to 2.6.14-rc5-mm1 I have been greeted with:
PCI-Bridge- Detected Parity Error on 0000:00:08.0 0000:00:08.0
Which is:
0000:00:08.0 PCI bridge: nVidia Corporation nForce2 External PCI
Bridge (rev a3) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])
        Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop-
ParErr- Stepping- SERR+ FastB2B-
        Status: Cap- 66Mhz+ UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=fast >TAbort-

        Latency: 0
        Bus: primary=00, secondary=01, subordinate=01, sec-latency=32
        I/O behind bridge: 00009000-0000afff

... I probably get a new one every minute or so. Is this new, perhaps
part of the new EDAC stuff? And what kind of adverse effect does this
have on my computer (the actual parity error)?
Thanks,
avuton
