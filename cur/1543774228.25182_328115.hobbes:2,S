Here are more comments and a patch for you (attached).
ver. a7:
output file with '/' didn't work for me; changed to hyphens;
just one one tmp file name (not several p?.txt);
write the input TXT lines to the temp file before calling editor;
remove the tmp file at end;
I think that the editor and email client Q&A is overkill.
