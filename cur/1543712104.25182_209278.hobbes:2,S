What is real mode on PPC? I do not have PPC here, I guess you'd have
to do that.

Yes, swsusp2 is faster. It is also 10x more code. We could probably
stop freeing as soon as half of memory is free; OTOH if memory is
disk cache, it might be faster to drop it than write to swap, then
read back [swsusp2 shows its not usually the case, through].
