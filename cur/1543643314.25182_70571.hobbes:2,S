It sits at the same point I started getting the unexpected interrupt message.
I waited over five minutes to see if the boot would resume.

I have not built any of the recient ac series - been waiting for a reiserfs patch.
Will try 2.4.20-pre5-ac4 and pre6-acx tonight.

No.  The boot stalled.  The hda stuff is from the dmseg log on a serial 
console.  The other comments on general info on long standing promise 
issues (hopfully fixed in ac).

Realize how anemic this report is.  I am willing to get more info on
this - just am not sure what you need or how to get the info.  IDE and
the boot sequence is not an area of the kernel I know much about.  
Please let me know what would give you the best clues.
Meanwhile I wil try the recient ac(s).
