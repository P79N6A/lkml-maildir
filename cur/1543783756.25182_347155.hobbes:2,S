The above is a decent technical justification for why the code is generally 
required; it's set my mind at rest, I thought maybe this was only for the 
speedtouch modem crew.
I was aware of ATM's ability to interleave data and "digital voice" services; 
ATM is widely deployed across Europe in preparation for "pure digital" 
consumer telephony..
My primary concern with the ATM code is that it's not (yet) an often used part 
of the kernel; there are a number of viable applications out there, but most 
can happily use linux-atm and/or pppd. I can see VoIP clients doing the same.
However, for embedded or non-pure-client purposes, there's a reason for an 
in-kernel implementation.
I don't know enough about the applications of the "ATM stack" versus using a 
userspace library, so I think as long as the patch is cleaned up and can be 
reused, it's okay to put in the kernel.

I agree, if there are users beyond the speedtouch modem, it may make sense to 
have this code in the kernel. Thanks for fielding my questions.
