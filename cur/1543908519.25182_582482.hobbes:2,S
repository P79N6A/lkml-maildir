I'm not 100% sure, but (at least) Debian has two programs "sfxload" 
and "asfxload", which work with OSS and ALSA respectively. I've found that 
both can work, but the former will only work with OSS emulation loaded. If 
you have an "asfxload", I would try it instead.

Not that it explains any of this, of course. I hope you can reproduce it.
