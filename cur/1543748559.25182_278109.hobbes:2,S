is the userspace delay measurement nested inside the kernel-based
method? I.e. is it something like:
	gettimeofday(0,1);
	timestamp1 = cycles();
	... loop some ...
	timestamp2 = cycles();
	gettimeofday(0,0);
and do you get 'unreported' latencies in such a case too? If yes then
that would indeed indicate a tracer bug. But if the measurement is done
like this:
	gettimeofday(0,1);
	timestamp1 = cycles();
	... loop some ...
	gettimeofday(0,0);		// [1]
	timestamp2 = cycles();		// [2]
then a delay could get inbetween [1] and [2].
OTOH if the 'loop some' time is long enough then the [1]-[2] window is
too small to be significant statistically, while your logs show a near
50% 'miss rate'.
