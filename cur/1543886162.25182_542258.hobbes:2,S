However, that does *not* translate to: "..so  we can do it for all buses".
People *do* depend on simple things like internal harddisks showing up in 
a particular order. The fact that you *can* handle it with UUID's etc does 
not mean that people do, or that they should be forced to do so.
There is no inherent goodness in making the bootup more random. In fact, 
there's a lot of badness to it, ranging from just not being very nice to 
"really a bitch to debug". And no amount of "user level _could_ handle it" 
changes that.
