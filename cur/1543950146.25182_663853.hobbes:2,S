Thanks for catching the stupidity.  Did it actually happen?  PC commands
are not completed in pieces and padding / draining should only happen
for those.  qc->extra_len should be zero where commands can be splitted
for all current cases.

This is getting insanely subtle.  Let's say there's PIO driver which
transfer certain sized chunks at a time and completes request partially
after completing each chunk and the driver uses draining to eat up
whatever excess data, which seems like a legit use case to me.  But it
won't work because __end_that_request_first() will terminate when it
reaches reaches the 'true' transfer size.  That's just broken API.  FWIW,
