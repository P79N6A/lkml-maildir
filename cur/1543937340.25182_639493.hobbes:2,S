In ext4 we store per-group state flags in each group, and the group
descriptor is checksummed (to detect spurious flags), so it should
be relatively straight forward to store an "error" flag in a single
group and have it become read-only.
As a starting point, it would be worthwhile to check instances of
ext4_error() to see how many of them can be targetted at a specific
group.  I'd guess most of them could be (corrupt inodes, directory
and indirect blocks, incorrect bitmaps).
Cheers, Andreas
