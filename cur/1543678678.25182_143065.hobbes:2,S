Hi swsusp'ers...  I've been looking through some software suspend code, 
and I think there's an error in acpi_suspend.  The code is checking that 
  we're trying to move into a valid state.  The check now reads:
if (state == ACPI_STATE_S2 || state == ACPI_STATE_S3 || ACPI_STATE_S4) {
/* do stuff */
}
This check will always be true, since ACPI_STATE_S4 is defined to be 4.
The attatched patch fixes this bug by putting a 'state == ' in front of 
the 'ACPI_STATE_S4'.
Cheers!
