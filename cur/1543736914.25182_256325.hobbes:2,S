I will verify this in a few days, I have some real work to do first.

Removing a CD leaves you with a drive between controller and media.
1st case: ioctl -> IDE driver -> drive
(lack of refcounting workarounded by ide-default)
2nd case: ioctl -> IDE driver
(lack of refcounting)

Doesn't matter. race is the same AFAICS, drive->usage
access is not protected by any lock.

OK BKL protects us against i.e. concurrent HDIO_GETGEO
and hotplug ioctl.  There is however no protection for controller
hotplug.
