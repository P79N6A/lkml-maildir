 sir,
i got some doubts in kernel
programming. i am using linux 6.1 version. i want to use threads in
kernel.is it possible to use pthreads in kernel. there is one more
function kernel_thread. can i use
that function. if i use that function how to get synchonization. inmany
files it was used. but everywhere lock_kernel() and unlock_kernel()
functions are being used. if we use that commands the whole kernel gets
locked. is there any other mechanisms. or can i use that methods only. if
i can use these methods what is the syntax of kernel_thread function. the
arguments that are passing to these function are 3. i dont know what are
those three. please  tell me.
