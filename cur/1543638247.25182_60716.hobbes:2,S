Dunno, I didn't verify that.

Ehrm, on my CPU (AMD K6/2) pushf and popf does use all 32 bits
of the flag register when prefixed with 0x66 in real mode. And
the emulation of those instructions in the Linux kernel does
that too. Any documentatin on an implementation doing otherwise?

I just verified, yes the AC flag does get cleared.

Did you test that with AC enabled?

That is also what I believed, but the specification obviously
says something else.

Does that mean you can setup a 32 bit interrupt table in
real mode????

I was talking about real mode where it seems we have a
32-bit IRET instruction. At least that is what the kernel
emulates.
