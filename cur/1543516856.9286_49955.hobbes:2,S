I'm working on a server that uses the sigwaitinfo / rt signal approach for IO.
This process uses sigqueue() for inter-thread comunication as well and fcntl
(F_SETSIG/F_SETOWN/F_SETFL) for network IO.  I've run into a situation where
the system-wide rt signal queue (if there is such a critter) seems to be full:
	> cat /proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max
	> 1024
	> cat /proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-nr
	> 1024
This, of course, stops the server dead since it can't recieve network events.
This condition does not go away when I shut down the process.  If I manually
raise rtsig-max, the server can continue to run.  Is there a way to flush the
system rt signal queue?
Could someone clue me in on how rt signals are handled, and on what these
/proc entries represent?
Kernel 2.3.28, up and smp.
