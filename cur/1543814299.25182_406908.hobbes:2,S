ata_bmdma_status() is just a single IO read, and even 1ms is highly 
improbable.
I'd look elsewhere.  There are a ton of udelay() calls in the legacy PCI 
IDE BMDMA code paths (sata_nv uses these), so I'm not surprised there is 
latency in general, in a libata+sata_nv configuration.  Status checks 
for example (ata_busy_wait in libata.h) are basically
	while (ioreadX() != condition)
		udelay(10)
That delay is mainly a "don't pound too hard on the hardware" delay.  If 
the hardware is really slow completing a command after signalling 
completion, you'll potentially wait up to 1000*10 us in some cases.  And 
there are other delays, such as the per-command ndelay() plus ioread().
Welcome to the wonderful world of IDE.
