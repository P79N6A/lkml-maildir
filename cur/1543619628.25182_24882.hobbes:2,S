But you still need monolithic makefiles.
They also control order across directories as well, including up one,
down two constructs like this.
obj-$(CONFIG_SCSI_AHA1740)      += aha1740.o
ifeq ($(CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX),y)
obj-$(CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX)      += aic7xxx/aic7xxx_drv.o
endif
obj-$(CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX_OLD)  += aic7xxx_old.o
and the abomination
obj-$(CONFIG_SCSI_LASI700)      += lasi700.o 53c700.o
subdir-$(CONFIG_ARCH_ACORN)     += ../acorn/scsi
obj-$(CONFIG_ARCH_ACORN)        += ../acorn/scsi/acorn-scsi.o
obj-$(CONFIG_CHR_DEV_ST)        += st.o
BTW, the grouped initcalls in the code are exactly what I proposed in
October 2000 and was shouted down.  Except my proposal would have put
all the initialization order information together, instead of putting
some information in the source and some in the Makefiles.  It is now
even harder to see the precise order, you have to check which type of
initcall each source is using in addition to scanning the makefile
order.
