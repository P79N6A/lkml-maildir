Subject: [PATCH] driver core: change bus_rescan_devices to return void
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[PATCH] driver core: change bus_rescan_devices to return void
No one was looking at the return value of bus_rescan_devices, and it
really wasn't anything that anyone in the kernel would ever care about.
So change it which enabled some counting code to be removed also.
