Sorry, I forgot, again. I sent those by hand, while I have that logic in 
my scripts.

	for i 1..1021
		fd[i] = epoll_create()
	for i 1..1021
		for j 1..1021, j != i
			epoll_ctl(fd[i], ADD, fd[j])
I'm not sure we want to advertise it too much though.

I think so, given that we've seen that putting too restrictive limits 
creates more problems. A similar thing, even though milder, exist on 
sys_poll too. sys_poll eats (on a 32bit box) 28 bytes of kernel memory for 
each 12 bytes of user memory, worse figures on a 64bit box.

Need to add to my quilt diff options :)

That's the right thing.
