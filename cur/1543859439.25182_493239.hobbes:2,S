I disagree, it seems to me most "experimental platform support code"
is simply enabled because it doesn't even have a CONFIG option (c.f.,
recent genirq and IO-APIC breakage on x86-64). With regards to this
specific option, you might even say that not defaulting to 'y' here
would be a regression in behaviour against previous released kernels,
which used Calgary if it was compiled in, no questions asked. So at
least in that sense, instructing the user to select y if unsure and
default y are appropriate.

Sorry about that (both the wrong changelog entry and the fact that it
broke your box).

Yes, I realized that once I've read your other mail.
