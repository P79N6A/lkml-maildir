I didn't mean it was supposed to be research project in some
University. But IIRC it was founded by what is defined as R&D in the
income statement of a public company. That's why I called so, given it
wasn't incorporated in mainline or forked trees, and it eventually
bitrotten. I didn't mean to de-qualify the effort by calling it that
way. Infact I'm just saying it is valid now more than ever before,
given the current directions that are being pushed for mainline.

Not so sure as you are, I'm not even invited to KS this year, but I
guess that's fair enough punishment for me, given I also wasted some
time with other activities that in the long run I hope will become
profitable (this remains to be seen though, there's an Italian saying
that "who wants too much will get nothing" ;). But I'll be at the VM
summit which to me is probably more important than KS and I hope to
have some discussion about this stuff there, hope you're there
too. Anyway there's no reason why you shouldn't contribute to
CONFIG_PAGE_SHIFT if you want. I don't really care if it's me doing
it, or you or Hugh, I stepped in first because of the great idea of
the Hack Week and second because I care that Linux goes in directions
that benefit everyone, not just a single filesystem running on top of
some scatter gather crippled storage that slowdowns like a crawl if
the sg entries are small (which is something CONFIG_PAGE_SHIFT will
address too just fine but while giving other advantages at the same time).
I'm also not against the defrag efforts, but I simply want to reduce
the maximum the code that require order > 0 allocations for
strict performance reasons. defrag is by far not a free operation, it
even requires memcopies of the bulk data payload or swapouts.
For the kernel stack btw, when alloc_pages(order=1) fails vmalloc
should be used and 4k stacks can be dropped. Nobody does dma from the
stack anymore these days IIRC (it doesn't work in all archs anyway).
