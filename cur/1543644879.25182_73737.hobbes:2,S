I'm talking about 2.4-ac with the new IDE code, not Marcelo
2.4.

Again, I'm talking about the new layer. In this, the iops
functions are no longer macros defined by include/asm*/ide.h,
but are now function pointers inside the hwif structure
(so we can now deal with real MMIO or CPU register based IDE
without playing macro tricks in asm*/ide.h).
The problem resides in the default implementation of those
iops in the new ide-iops.c file, which currently re-implements
insw as a loop of IN_WORD, which usually translates to inw,
and thus would cause incorrect endianness.
My patch fixes that. Ultimately, we want to completely get
rid of the uppercase {IN,OUT}{BYTE,WORD,LONG} macros though.
The principle is that ide-iops.c will provide reasonable
"default" ops for PIO (and MMIO if my next patch gets in),
any "different" interface can provide it's own ops, and you
keep the ability to mix different kind of interfaces on the
same machine (like an embeded CPU-register based interface
_and_ a PCI based interface using different iops).
Ben.
