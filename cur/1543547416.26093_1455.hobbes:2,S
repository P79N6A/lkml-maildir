Of course not.  Linux does not have a kernel debugger, or it would use
them.  That's what they are used for -- debugging running tasks from a
kernel debugger that has it's own task gates.  If you have nested task
gates, then you can debug the kernel debugger with them.

It will be when Linux finally implements real sleep locks in the kernel
instead of aliased semaphores.
