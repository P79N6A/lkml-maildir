With that patch the /dev/fd0H1440 device now seems to work. However,
the /dev/fd0 (autosensing) device gets its very first read or write
after boot wrong. For example, dd if=/dev/fd0 bs=8k count=1 of=/dev/null
only reads 4096 bytes, and likewise a write will only write 4096 bytes
before reporting ENOSPC. Accesses after the first work though.
