Oops, when you mentioned this on irc, I thought you were referring to
class_devices not classes.  I don't want classes to be able to be
nested, only class devices.
I don't see a need for nested classes, as I thought the input thread had
resolved itself so that it didn't need it (but I stopped paying
attention, sorry, so I might be wrong here...)
Why can't you just use class_device's that can have children?  That way
the /sys/block stuff could be converted to also use this.
thanks,
greg k-h
