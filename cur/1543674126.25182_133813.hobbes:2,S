I've read the announcement of gcc 3.3 and saw that gcc 3.2 is not yet
supported for linux kernel compilations (I've been using Red Hat's
gcc-3.2.3-4 to compile 2.5.69-mm6). So I thought, what would happen if I
use gcc 2.96 to compile the kernel instead?
And voilà... I've compiled 2.5.69-mm6 with Red Hat's 2.96.118 and now,
I'm unable to reproduce the pccard oops you've been trying to chase
down. Does this mean the pccard oops was caused by a compiler bug?
RFC is welcome.
Thanks!
