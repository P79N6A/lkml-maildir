Hello,
I have a problem with the kernel level autoconfiguration and remote booting.
I use ISC dhcpd and kernel 2.2.14. Everything works OK until I add
the domain-name option to the dhcpd config file - after that it does not see 
the configured root path and uses default (tftpboot/%s). There is an easy 
workaround (just change the default in the kernel), but I would like to 
know what is wrong.
