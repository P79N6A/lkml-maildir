No.
Kai is only banging on the current build system to make it somewhat more
palatable.  While this is certainly useful today, those efforts would
probably produce a better system in the long run if they were directed at
kbuild25 instead.
Or maybe people just don't care enough about the build system for kbuild25
to be worth it...
