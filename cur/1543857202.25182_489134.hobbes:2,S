Yes I think so too.

In general, workqueue functions wanting to flush workqueue seems wierd
to me. But in this case, I think the requirement is to block until all
queued work is complete, which is what flush_workqueue is supposed to
do. Hence I dont see any way to avoid it ..

IMHO, rehauling lock_cpu_hotplug() to support scenarios like this is a
better approach. 
	- Make it rw-sem
	- Make it per-cpu mutex, which could be either:
		
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/30/110
 - Ingo's suggestion
		
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/26/65
 - Gautham's work based on RCU
In Ingo's suggestion, I really dont know if the task_struct
modifications is a good thing (to support recursive requirements).
Gautham's patches avoid modifications to task_struct, is fast but can
starve writers (who want to bring down/up a CPU).
