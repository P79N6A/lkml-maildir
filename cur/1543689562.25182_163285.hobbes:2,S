Ok, I understand why you want matching alignments now. :)
(So that MS_INVALIDATE doesn't have to do anything).

Linux hasn't ever done anything useful with PROT_SEM.  As far as I
know, on some other systems PROT_SEM has meant that you mark pages
uncacheable or similar, but only on systems where that is needed to
implement IPC through the shared memory.  For some definition IPC.
