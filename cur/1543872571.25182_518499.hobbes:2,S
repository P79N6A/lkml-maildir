So, in the meantime, the period is 1/HZ?
I also have a question about clockevent cpumasks.  I was using the lapic
clockevent as a model, but as I understand it there's a lapic per CPU,
which explains why it registers a clockevent per cpu with that cpu alone
in the cpumask.
The Xen timer is a bit different; I guess more like hpet.  There's a
single (virtual-)machine-wide timer, which is "owned" by the last cpu
with programmed it; ie, that cpu is the one which gets the resulting
event interrupt.  Does this mean I should register a single clockevent
device with a cpumask of CPU_MASK_ALL?  Or should I constrain it to a
single cpu?
There's a comment in hpet.c saying
		 * Start hpet with the boot cpu mask and make it
		 * global after the IO_APIC has been initialized.
but I don't see any place where the hpet cpumask is updated.
Thanks,
