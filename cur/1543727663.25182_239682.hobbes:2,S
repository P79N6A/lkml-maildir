Sorry, guess I forgot to reply on linux-kernel. What I mean is that MO
drives should just have CDC_RAM set - it doesn't denote a specific
device type, rather just the ability to work like a hard drive. If you
could look into why that isn't set for your mo device and send a patch
for that, it would be much better.
