The bugzilla entry was hijacked by people who were incorrectly
 thinking their problem had to do with my report, I myself have
 always stated HAL/polling had nothing to do with the issue. Not
 my fault, there...
I may of course re-file the bug, but it'd be nice if I were asked
 by someone looking after the Fedora bugzilla; as a matter of
 fact I did ask for opinions there after my last findings.
