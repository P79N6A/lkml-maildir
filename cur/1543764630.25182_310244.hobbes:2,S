From config.gz:
# Linux kernel version: 2.6.11
ONFIG_CDROM_PKTCDVD=y
CONFIG_CDROM_PKTCDVD_BUFFERS=32
# CONFIG_CDROM_PKTCDVD_WCACHE is not set

I don't know how the OOM killer is supposed to work, but I think it's
strange that it is triggered when there is 28MB RAM available and when
"writeback" is 114320, which means that a lot more memory will become
available by just waiting for the I/O to complete.
