My mistake. npages counts only writes...
However, I still stand by my statement that nfs_wb_all() is supposed
to ensure that *all* pending writes have been cleared.
The only explanation for npages != 0 is if
  a) an error occurred with nfs_wb_all() (we should perhaps test the
     return value of nfs_wb_all() there). Under normal circumstances,
     an error should only occur if you're using soft mounts, though.
  b) somebody redirtied the page *after* nfs_wb_all() was done.
Cheers,
  Trond
