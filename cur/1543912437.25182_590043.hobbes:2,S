I didn't compare -- it no doubt will. I know the title of this thread is 
"CFS review" but it turned into Keith Packard noticing glxgears being broken 
on recent-ish X.org. The start of the thread was about things being broken 
using _software_ rendering though, so I thought it might be useful to 
remark/report glxgears also being quite broken using hardware rendering on 
my setup at least.

If you're asking in a "I'll go debug the DRM" way I'll go dig a bit later 
(please say) but if you are only interested in the thread due to CFS, note 
that I'm aware it's not likely to have anything to do with CFS.
It's not reproducable for you? (full description of bug above).
Rene.
