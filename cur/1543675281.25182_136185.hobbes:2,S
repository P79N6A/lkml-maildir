Yeah !, I'm no longer alone .. :-)

Note that the fact that you see the times changing in the fs while it
is mounted doesn't imply a problem in itself: serial and tty device
nodes get their time-stamps updated too on a read-only fs when they
are written.  But these changes are in ram only: when you reboot you
get the old values back.
But with FIFOs the changes *do* get written out to the read-only fs !
Hmm, wonder what happens if you try it on a real read-only medium like
a CDR.  Maybe kernel errors/panic ..

Seems very stupid to me if POSIX specifies this.
I don't have the POSIX spec, but maybe it specifies what "read-only"
is supposed to mean somewhere too ..
But let's wait & see .. :-)
