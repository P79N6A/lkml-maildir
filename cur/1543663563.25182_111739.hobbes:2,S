It's not a question of revenue, it's one of profit. Very few people buy
desktops for use with Linux, compared to those that buy them for Windows.
The profit on each PC is small, thus I still think a substantial proportion
of the profit made by hardware vendors by Linux is on servers rather than
desktop PCs. The numbers will be smaller for high end machines, but the
profit margins are much higher.
