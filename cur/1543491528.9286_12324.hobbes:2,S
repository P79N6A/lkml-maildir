I was curious about this myself - why it was appearing twice like that.  I
had done a lot of kernel recompiles earlier, so I went ahead and took
2.2.5ac1 and did "make clean ;  make mrproper", along with wiping out
/lib/modules for kicks.  Redid my config, and recompiled with no mtrr but
joystick as a module (as per usual) - installed the modules, etc, and I
went and loaded joystick and joy-gravis by hand.  No problems...
So I went back in, did a make clean, included mtrr in my config, and
recompiled and reinstalled everything.  Went to put in the modules by hand
(joystick, joy-gravis) and it worked....False alarm.
I guess somehow I skipped a make clean or otherwise ended up with what you
suggested - joystick must have gotten compiled into the kernel, not as a
module.  I'm sorry for taking everybody's time - I usually do my best to
isolate any problems/solve them before going to ask for help :)
Sorry about the false alarm,
-V
