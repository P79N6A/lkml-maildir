Sounds straight forward enough.
I make sure the appropriate line is at the bottom  of the changelog
comment for every patch I submit.
When I get a patch from someone else that doesn't have their
Signed-off-by line, I either:
  1/ if it is a trivial patch, just add  
               From:  Random J Developer <random@developer.org>
  2/ if it is more substantial (using my own personal definition of
     substantial), I ask them to sign it off.

If this is version 1.0, then presumably there might be a version X, 
 X != 1.0  one day. In that case, should the Signed-off-by: tag indicate
 the Certificate of Origin that they are asserting by reference?
e.g.
    Signed-off-by:  Random J Developer <random@developer.org> (certificate=1.0)
or maybe
    Origin-certified-1.0-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.org>
Maybe I'm being too legalistic...
