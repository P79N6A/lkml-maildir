Hi Jeremy
I will try this as soon as possible, thank you.
However I have some remarks browsing your patch.

if !CONFIG_SMP, why even dereferencing boot_pda+PDA_cpu to get 0 ?
and as PER_CPU(cpu_gdt_descr, %ebx) in !CONFIG_SMP doesnt need the a value in 
ebx, you can just do :
#define CUR_CPU(reg) /* nothing */

My patch was better IMHO : we dont need to force asm () instructions to 
perform regular C variable reading/writing in !CONFIG_SMP case.
Using plain C allows compiler to generate a better code.
