Yes.  An Lindent patch needs to contain absolutely nothing else, not 
even documentation changes.
The rationale is that it is extremely difficult for reviewers to review 
your non-Lindent changes, because they are so obscured by Lindent.
In the past, one person even hid a [valid] security fix inside an 
Lindent patch.
