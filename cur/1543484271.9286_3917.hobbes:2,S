Cool. Nice to see I wasn't offbeam. As for alignments, if it helps I'd say
use it. It can't really hurt, can it? Especially if you don't have a Xeon
or a PIII but a newer PII.
As for the patch, using it right now with -mpentiumpro and my version
of the above and it's working well. Hasn't blown up my computer at any
rate. :) I can't say if it's working any better though. I have a Pentium
II (Deschutes).
