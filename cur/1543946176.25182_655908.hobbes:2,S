Ok, I looked at the code and it is hightly questionable to me that this
check does work in a crosscompile environment (which the ARM build
most likely is).
It seems to check the size of the structure in the .o file against
the size of the structure on the _host_ where it is compiled.
I can't see why we would want to check _anything_ of the target stuff
to the host this stuff is compiled on.
I can compile an ARM kernel on any machine I want.
There actually is a comment:
 * Check that sizeof(device_id type) are consistent with size of section
 * in .o file. If in-consistent then userspace and kernel does not agree
 * on actual size which is a bug.
So it seems what this check _wants_ to compare the sizeof the structure
in the kernel to the size of the stucture in the userland of the target system.
But it does _not_ do that.
It does compare the size of the structure in the kernel against the size of
the stucture in userland on the machine it is _compiled_ on.
That is wrong.
