Well, the patch cleans up the fact that preloaded defaults are stomped on
by uninitialised data. Now they are stomped on by 0 !! Gradual
improvement.
Actually, if the patch that moves ide_init_default_hwifs() is applied then
maybe this isn't strictly necessary. The whole area needs cleaning up, but
I was loathe to start doing major changes. I've done large parts of the
call tree for the ide driver, and I _still_ don't fully understand what
should be called when. Just as a sample, there's:
	ide_init_data
	ide_init_default_hwifs
	ide_init_hwif_ports
	init_hwif_data
	ideprobe_init
	probe_hwif_init
	hwif_init
	etc.
with little or no explanation as to what they do, but more crucially, when
they should be called. You can work out what they each do, but an idea of
the initialisation architecture would really help sort out if there are
branches that can now be got rid of.
