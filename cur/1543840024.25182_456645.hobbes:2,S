Implementation might need some idiot proofing.
After mount/cd cpuset, somebody might think "gee, why should I need to
create a group 'all', when it's right there in the root, including all
it's tasks?  I'll just set cpu_exclusive, set meter_cpu...
...and after my box finishes rebooting, I'll alert the developer of this
patch set that very bad things happen the instant you do that :)
