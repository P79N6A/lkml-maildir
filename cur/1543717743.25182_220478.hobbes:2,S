Unfortunaltely my day job consumes all my time until end of next week.
After that I want to hack on the GNU acct tools so they understand the new 
formats. If that doesn't raise new problems, I'll submit a patch for 2.6.
Both v1 and v2 are intended to be binary compatible, v2 on m68k, v1 on 
all other platforms (I'll probably reverse the version numbers, so that
only m68k user might get confused by thinking that v2 is "better" than 
v1)
For 2.7, (and optional for 2,6), a new v3 format is planned with a 
properly aligned layout, so that much of the compatibility cruft can go.
Since v1, v2 and v3 formats already use up all 64 bytes of struct acct,
there also has been interest in an optional 128 byte v4 format. This would 
provide enough space to include tgid (further suggestions welcome).
This may sound like a plethora of new formats, but I think it provides a 
smooth transition if just one new release of the acct tools is able to 
read all of them.
sorry for the delay,
Tim
