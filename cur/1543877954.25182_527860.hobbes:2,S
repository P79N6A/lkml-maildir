Ok. I'll see what I can come up with and post another patch today or tomorrow.

For the moment, I made the change to topology_init() since it was the simplest 
fix to get things working. I have considered switching the perfmon2 
initialization to __initcall(), but there are apparently some timing issues 
with ensuring that the perfmon2 core code is initialized before any of its 
sub-modules. Since they could all be compiled statically in the kernel, I'm 
not sure if there's a way to ensure the ordering of calls within a single 
initcall level. I'll need to ask Stephane if there were any other reasons why 
subsys_initcall() was used for perfmon2.
Thanks, Arnd.
