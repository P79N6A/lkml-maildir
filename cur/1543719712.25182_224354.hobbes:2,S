	As I said, I think this thread is "becoming offtopic" but what can be
interesting is the swapping problem fragmentation :
	1.Global inactivity (what you're talking about)
	2.Application isolation (what we're talking about).
Geek or not, someone backgrounding an application doesn't want it to
down the box for X seconds some minutes later when it comes back and
such things arrive many times a day.Maybe you've got an idea about a
better rule(s) then ? (I mean for the 2 cases)
