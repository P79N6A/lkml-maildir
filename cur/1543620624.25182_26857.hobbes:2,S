This looks a really bad reversion. The CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE ifdef saves
over 70K of memory on my standard kernel build. Putting the file name pointers
back in everywhere is going to put a fair amount of that back except on 
very new gcc's that maybe will do string merging in this case. Have you
verified string merging occurs in gcc 2.95 for __FILE__ string constants
passed into asm blocks ? 
I also don't understand what the problem you are trying to solve is. If you
want to debug the kernel you build with debug verbose. If not you don't.
With the symbol table you can still easily trace down BUG events.
