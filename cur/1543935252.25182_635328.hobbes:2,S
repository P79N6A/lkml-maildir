OK, changed it.
I don't think this is the right way to do it, as you'll get email for
every change to every bug until it's assigned, but seeing as that's what
you asked for, and we can't seem to get vger to take bounces, I guess
it'll do.
Let me know if (a) it works OK, and (b) you want the driver ones changed
over as well.
