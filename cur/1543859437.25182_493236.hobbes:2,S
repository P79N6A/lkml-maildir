Hi Jens,
Thank you for the comment.

Because I'd like to use blk_get_request() in q->request_fn()
which can be called from interrupt context like below:
  scsi_io_completion -> scsi_end_request -> scsi_next_command
  -> scsi_run_queue -> blk_run_queue -> q->request_fn
Generally, device-mapper (dm) clones an original I/O and dispatches
the clones to underlying destination devices.
In the request-based dm patch, the clone creation and the dispatch
are done in q->request_fn().  To create the clone, blk_get_request()
is used to get a request from underlying destination device's queue.
By doing that in q->request_fn(), dm can deal with struct request
after bios are merged by __make_request().
Do you think creating another function like blk_get_request_nowait()
is acceptable?
Or request should not be allocated in q->request_fn() anyway?
Do you have any other ideas?
