If you have PCMCIA enabled, but CONFIG_ISA disabled and it discovers
that you have ISA interrupts, then Bad Things Will Happen.  Howver,
if you have PCMCIA enabled and it doesn't find any ISA interrupts,
we couldn't care less about the setting of CONFIG_ISA.
We should probably force the per-socket irq_mask to zero if CONFIG_ISA
isn't set... I'll look into that once the hot weather has abaited.
