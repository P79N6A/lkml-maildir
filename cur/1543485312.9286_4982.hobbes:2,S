D'oh. Code in question is in filesystems. Look: suppose you want to
allocate a data associated with inode. You will do it from read_inode()
and on inode creation, all right, but where will you free it? The *only*
resonable place being ->clear_inode() method. And it's called by
fs/inode.c::clear_inode(). Called by fs/inode.c::dispose_list(). Called
by fs/inode.c::free_inodes(). Called by fs/inode.c::free_inode_memory().
See the path now?
	Again, it doesn't free inode memory per se. But for some inodes it
informs filesystems that they should free their internal data associated
with said inodes.
