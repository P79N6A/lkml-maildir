I actually did the pid changes partly to flush out problems spots, on 
purpose making it 30 bits even though I actually eventually still think 
that we may want to use a few bits for things like node ID numbers etc.

Add a warning for now, the same way we did with stat() etc when moving to 
64 bits.

Fair enough.
