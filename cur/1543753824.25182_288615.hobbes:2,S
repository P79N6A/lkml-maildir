maybe this could even be fit into existing ptrace semantics, without any
need for PTRACE_ATTACH_JAIL. What we need is to catch the case where a
ptraced child is running (i.e. the signal_wake_up() has already been
done, and the parent is waiting for the child to stop again), and the
ptrace parent is killed unexpectedly.  Would it be a correct fix to just
unconditionally stop the child in this case (and leave it hanging in
such a state)? Or to kill it right away?
