I think there is no distinction WRT RAM test between cold and warm
boot anymore. If the BIOS clears the RAM is, I think, determined by
the "fast POST" option in BIOS setup (it always checks the size
so some bytes will be changed anyway).

Yes but it uses (or, rather, used) a CMOS flag to skip POST (not only
the RAM test) and to go directly to the entry point in real mode.
IIRC (I may be wrong, that was 15+ years ago) only 286 required
KBC reset to return to real mode (did LOADALL matter?), 386s have
no such problem.
BTW I understand the idea have nothing to do with actual aircraft,
so it would be the admin rather than NTSB looking at the data(?).
