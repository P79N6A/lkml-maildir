Yep.  That is why I was so worried aboit the writepages file op.
It's rather hackish (only write, looks usefull only for networking)
instead of the proposed rw_kiovec fop.

Yuck.  A new file_opo just to get a few benchmarks right ...
I hope the writepages stuff will not be merged in Linus tree
(but I wish the code behind it!)
