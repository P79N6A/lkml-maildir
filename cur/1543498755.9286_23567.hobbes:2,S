Gordon,
These names tend to interfere with client side operations (NetWare disallows
them -- period -- because of known problems they cause with client software
and network client side applications).  Sounds like you would rather be
"right" and win an argument rather than just fix the damn thing.  I brought
this to folks attention because I've seen it affect network apps on NetWare
servers (it was a known SPD (bug) at Novell).  I'll fix it myself and submit
it to Alan.
Thanks,
Jeff
