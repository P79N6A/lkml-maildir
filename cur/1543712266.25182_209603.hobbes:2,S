linux-kernel isn't the right forum for this, but I'll take a stab
anyways.

The kernel should be doing the right thing to preserve FPU state during
context switches.  That doesn't prevent the app from doing things wrong
and thus getting the wrong answer (perhaps only under certain
circumstances).  And of course the kernel might have bugs (though it's
unlikely to be as simple as "doesn't preserve FPU state correctly"; a
lot of people depend on that codepath being right.)
Likely there is some difference in one of the following areas:
 - hardware problems
 - kernel
 - libraries
 - CPU microcode
Or, you have a bug in your program which is triggered by some
environmental factor.  (For example, an inter-thread race condition
affected by IO interrupts.)
To eliminate them:
 - first, run memtest86 or a similar program to verify that you are not
   simply victim of a bad memory stick.
 - next, check that the kernel, libc, and libm are identical across the
   machines that display the problem.
 - next, check /proc/cpuinfo and dmesg(1) output to verify that your
   CPUs are the same stepping, and running the same microcode.  (The
   likelihood that this is the problem is so small as to be almost not
   worth mentioning.)

You don't say how many different results you've gotten.  Is there just
one correct and one incorrect result?  Or do different runs give
different incorrect results?  What is the software environment?
(language, libraries, threading, etc.)
Basically, at this point you haven't provided us enough information to
be able to even point a finger at the kernel.  It's certainly possible
that there's a bug, but it's pretty unlikely (IMO).  I'd be looking at
hardware and at threading problems in the apps, first.
