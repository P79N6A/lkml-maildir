No, it wouldn't, as you could drop the assumption that the base of
the struct can be misaligned.  Thus, the compiler only needs to
generate unaligned loads and stores for fields which are unaligned
within the struct, which in this case would be none of them.
While it's rather unlikely that a struct like this one would ever
need packing, it would help those structs that do need it by reducing
the number of fields subjected to unaligned loads and stores.
