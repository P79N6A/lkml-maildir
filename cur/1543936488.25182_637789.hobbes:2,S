Nope. However the few disks that did this rapidly got firmware updates
because there are other OS's that can't cope.

most of the time. and fsck knows about writing sectors to remove read
errors in metadata blocks.

generally. Note btw that for added fun there is nothing that guarantees
the blocks around a block on the media are sequentially numbered. The
usually are but you never know.
