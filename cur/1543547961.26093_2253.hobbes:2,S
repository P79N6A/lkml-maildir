Subject: [PATCH] arcnet/com20020-isa.c - compile fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The 'clock' field was removed from the arcnet_local struct somewhere
recently, and was replaced by clockp. arcnet/com20020-isa.c still
uses 'clock' somewhere, so we got a compile error. No maintainer for
arcnet was mentioned in MAINTAINERS, So here's the fix, to be applied to
test8-pre5:
