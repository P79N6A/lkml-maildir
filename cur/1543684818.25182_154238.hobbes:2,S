Hi
as reported by someone earlier this year there's a long stack_dump
starting from kobject_register failed with -17 (EEXISTS) when ide-cs
detects a CF card.
The reason is as I see it that both rescan_partitions and register_disk
are called, both of which in turn call add_partition for all partitions
on the CF card. add_partition calls kobject_register. Also devfs_mk_bdev
is called twice but it only prints an error msg 'could not append...'. I
don't know if that is how things should be called or whether kobjects
for IDE are broken as Alan responded to that earlier post but apart from
this initial stack_dump the card works fine (not eject of course) So is
kobject_register to verbose or calling code should make sure it does not
attempt to register the same object multiple times?
