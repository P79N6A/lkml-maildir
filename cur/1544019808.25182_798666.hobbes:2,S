I think we can move the poll-fix (and definitely the debug-nuke-fix) to .30.
The bug happens when you add an epoll fd inside another wait container 
(epoll, poll, select). You may get a wakeup, to only find out later that 
epoll_wait() has no event for you. The bug has been there since day-1, and 
it has only recently been noticed.
Since it is quite some coe change, I'd like it to stage in your toxic tree 
for a while :)
