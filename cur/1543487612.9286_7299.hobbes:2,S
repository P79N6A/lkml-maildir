It is overkill, but the specification was not that we need to know that
it occurred within some time, but the actual time within a second so
you need to check it twice.
And yes Shannon worked for Ma Bell and published a lot of stuff. Basic
"digital information theory" was first published by Shannon,
"Communication in the presence of noise", Proc. IRE, 37, 10-21, Jan 1949.
The bottom line is that information is conveyed by changes. To detect a
change, one must sample an event at least twice as fast as it is expected
to change.
This sample rate is called the Nyquist rate. Nyquist preceded Shannon,
but in his day there was nothing called "digital" (he didn't do
windows!!).

Yep, but the latency required is defined by the application, not by
maintaining some fixed sampling (context switching) rate.

Yes exactly, and the application requirements, which was my original
premise. This is why a "Realtime Operating System" means nothing. It's
just a buzzword. It could mean that it contains something useful, but
may not.
It is only when one analyzes the application specific requirements that
one can make a determination about an Operating System's suitability
for a purpose.
