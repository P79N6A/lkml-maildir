I'm hoping there aren't any infrastructure upheavals that break drivers 
again, because if there are, I think we're going to have to make a 
separate rule for things like that: they have to be merged early in the 
sequence or not at all.
And in _general_ I find it very wrong to consciously leave the merge until 
the last day of the merge window.
If that keeps happening, I think I'll just make sure that I don't always 
merge on the last day or two. Just to make sure that submaintainers don't 
"game" the system the wrong way. Maybe my "two weeks" are sometimes just 
ten days long, who knows..
