I tried to make use of this behavior back in 2.2 days, I think,
and ran into trouble.  The time remaining wasn't quite right, I seem
to recall, making this nifty feature less useful.  I've since
given up on it.

Can you give an example of a clueful package that makes
use of this feature and would be harmed if select() suddenly
became posix-compliant?
