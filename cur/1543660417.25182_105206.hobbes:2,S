> ksymoops 2.4.4 on i686 2.4.18-19.7.xsmp.  Options used
2.4.18-19.7.x should not need ksymoops, because it ships with
kksymoops. In fact, it's harmful, because ksymoops ate the EIP
decoding:
> EIP:    0010:[<f897f51d>]    Not tainted
> Using defaults from ksymoops -t elf32-i386 -a i386
> EFLAGS: 00010246
Also, the oops does not seem to be related to the BCM card.
Probably your IDE cabling is flakey :)
