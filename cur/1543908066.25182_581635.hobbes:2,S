Hi,
I just completed a git bisect, and commit 
8dfe4b14869fd185ca25ee88b02ada58a3005eaf was the commit that introduced 
this problem. This is "usb-storage: implement autosuspend". I don't 
think there have been many changes in drivers/usb since I last verified 
this problem, so I'm pretty sure this is still happening in the latest 
kernel.
The first thing I am going to do is pull the latest sources, attempt to 
revert this patch, and see whether the kernel compiles and works 
properly with my USB hard drive. Please let me know of anything I can do 
to help.
Dan
