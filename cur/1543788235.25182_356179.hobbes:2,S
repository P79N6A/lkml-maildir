What you don't understand is that Netware's permissions mechanish is 
totally different that Linux. A hard link in Netware wouldn't inherit 
rights the way Linux does. So the user would have rights to their hard 
link to delete that link without having rights to unlink the file.
This is an important concept so pay attention. Linux stores all the 
permission to a file with that file entry. Netware doesn't. Netware 
calculates effective rights from the parent directories and it is all 
inherited unless files or directoies are explicitly set differently. So 
if files are added to other people folders then those people get rights 
to it automatically without having to go to the second step of changing 
the file's permissions.
