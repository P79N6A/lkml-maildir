Ok, thanks Tim, I'll keep including it in my kernel since it allows my systems
to live such a long life :-) But I don't think they will ever beat Alan's box
which lasted 1100 days on 1.2.13 ! And that would not be reasonable because
even for security reasons, you sometimes have to upgrade.
BTW, that reminds me of Netware's patches that were basically hot fixes that
you could apply without shutting the system down. That was really wonderful a
feature that I would love to see on Linux. This is already doable with modules,
but not with the system core.
Regards,
Willy
