I've been using this patch for a while now on my box (with 1GB):
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.23aa1/00_3.5G-address-space-5
(kernel is 'vanilla' otherwise)
This allows you to use your full 1GB w/out highmem support.... (2G/2G 
user/kernel addr space split, or something..)
Anything (potentially) wrong/bad about this patch??
Is there a simmilar patch for 2.6??
Rgds,
Mark.
pls. CC in reply, I'm not on the list....
