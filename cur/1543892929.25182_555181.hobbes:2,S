open/close/stat/lstat are _the_ most important system calls, so yes, it's 
a majorly critical path. MUCH more so than opening a new TCP connection.
You _may_ open a few hundred TCP connections a second (yeah, yeah, don't 
tell me about unrealistic benchmarks that do more), but that's on a server 
with good bandwidth etc. open/closes easily happen tens of _thousands_ of 
times a second. We're talking sub-microsecond system calls.
Whether get_random_int() is noticeable or not, I dunno. But that path is a 
hell of a lot more performance-sensitive than pretty much anything else.
