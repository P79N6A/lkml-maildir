Thanks for reporting this failure Marcel.
I expect we'll have this problem in 2.4.26 too.

rats, I don't have a non-identity SCI over-ride like this to test on.

apparently setting up IRQ22 on the IOAPIC early made it unavailable for
subsequent request_irq().

Marcel,
I've dropped this info into a new bug report:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2366
can you add yourself to the cc:, and attach the complete dmesg -s40000
from the failure (or a "debug" console capture).  Would like to confirm
that IRQ22 got set up correctly in the IOAPIC.
There are two bugs here,
1. AE_NOT_ACQUIRED on non-identity mapped SCI over-ride -- new
2. boot failure on AE_NOT_ACQUIRED -- old
thanks,
-Len
