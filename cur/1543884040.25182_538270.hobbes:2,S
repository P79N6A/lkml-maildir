Subject: so ... what *are* candidates for removal?

  at the risk of spawning yet another thread and another flamefest,
what *are* the kernel features that should be considered candidates
for removal, either now or at some point in the future.
  please, no discussions about mechanisms or kernel warnings or the
like -- just the features whose value is nearing their end.  i'll even
volunteer to collect all that info and summarize it here:

because that's just the kind of guy i am, and i have the week off, and
i'm bored. :-)
