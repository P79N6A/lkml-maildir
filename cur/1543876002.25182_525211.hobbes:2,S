Hello,
I've been upgrading a few machines here at work and noticed some problems with high system cpu usage on one machine.  In trying to debug the problem I've come across a few confusing stats that I was hoping could be cleared up by someone on this list.
Firstly some info about the system.  It's a dell 2850 running a 32bit gentoo install with glibc 2.5 and kernel 2.6.19.  A single multi-threaded process is generating the system cpu usage.  One of our developers wrote the code and it does some intense disk reads and writes, which should create primarily iowait cpu usage.  On a debian system with the same hardware using glibc-2.4 and kernel 2.6.8 the process generates virtually 0 load compared the the upgraded server's load of 2-4.
Here is some disk usage info:

We rebooted it a few moments ago, but before that vmstat showed that the buffered memory was 0kb.  This is very different from the other machine which has around 500Mb.  A low buffer mem count seems common in our machines with kernel 2.6.17-2.6.19.  Looking at vmstat's man page its difficult to understand exactly what buffered mem is and how to go about altering things to get this value higher to test with.  It seems to be a computed value and not something settable via /proc.  Does any one know more about buffered memory and how to adjust it?
