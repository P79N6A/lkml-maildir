The softrepeat code should properly ignore all autorepeated keys from a
'dumb' keyboard. It's rather common that a keyboard we can't communicate
with is in autorepeat mode, because that's the mode AT keyboards wake up
in after power on.
A much simpler workaround for the DRAC3 is to set the softrepeat delay
to at least 750ms, using kbdrate(8), which will call the proper console
ioctl, resulting in updating the softrepeat parameters.
I prefer workarounds for problematic hardware done outside the kernel,
if possible.
