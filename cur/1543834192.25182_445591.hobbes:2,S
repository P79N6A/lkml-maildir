Subject: e1000: Problem with "disable CRC stripping workaround" patch

Hi Jesse,
	I just came across this:
  
http://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg14547.html
	I'm seeing a problem with this currently under Xen's bridging
configuration.
	Basically, with the patch, packets are being dropped at this point in
net/bridge/br_forward.c:
---
int br_dev_queue_push_xmit(struct sk_buff *skb)
{
        /* drop mtu oversized packets except gso */
	if (packet_length(skb) > skb->dev->mtu && !skb_is_gso(skb)) {
		kfree_skb(skb);
--
	What's happening that a 1500 byte packet comes in from e1000, onto the
bridge and is to be forwarded to a device whose mtu is 1500. Because the
CRC hasn't been stripped, skb->len is 1504 and the packet is dropped.
	One option is to fix this specific problem is to subtract the CRC
length from skb->len in e1000, another is to raise the MTU on the
receive side of Xen's loopback interface. I've attached a patch for the
latter, but I've no real opinion on which is more correct.
Cheers,
Mark.
