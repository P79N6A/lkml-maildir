I once sent a patch to linux.nics@intel.com for a use-after-free bug and
the reply I got was one that asked me which operating system I was
using. But to be fair I got one additional reply one day later that
suggested me to apply the latest patch from Jeff Garziks netdriver tree.
So I just sent the patch to the maintainers of the driver (at intel) and
netdev, they picked it up. So it's probably best to mail the maintainers
and cc netdev@vger.kernel.org , other people might be interested in this
information as well.
You'll find the maintainers listed in the MAINTAINERS file.
