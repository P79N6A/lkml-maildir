A LISP VM is a big, giant, bloated.... *CHOKE* *COUGH* *SPUTTER* 
*SUFFOCATE* ... thing which SHOULD NEVER be in the kernel.
If you want to use a more abstract language for describing kernel 
security policies, fine.  Just don't use LISP.
The right way to do it is this:
- A user space interpreter reads text-based config files and converts 
them into a compact, easy-to-interpret code used by the kernel.
- A VERY TINY kernel component is fed the security policy and executes it.
Move as much of the processing as reasonable into user space.  It's 
absolutely unnecessary to have the parser into the kernel, because 
parsing of the config files is done only when the ASCII text version 
changes.
It's absolutely unnecessary to have something as complex as LISP to 
interpret it, when something simple and compact could do just as well.
Why do you choose LISP?  Don't you want to use a language that sysadmins 
will actually KNOW?
