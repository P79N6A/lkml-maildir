Thanks, I overlooked the mmap vs mprotect detail. So how are the subsequent
access faults avoided?

Thanks for the clarification.

Ah, for big allocations. OK, we could make a MADV_POPULATE to prefault
pages (like mmap's MAP_POPULATE, but without the down_write(mmap_sem)).
If you're just about to use the pages anyway, how much of a win would
it be to avoid zeroing? We allocate cache hot pages for these guys...
