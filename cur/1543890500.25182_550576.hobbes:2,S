In fact, looking back at things I suspect the real culprit was
6b157c9bf3bace6eeb4a973da63923ef24995cce USB: separate autosuspend from 
external suspend
The patch you identified merely makes the problem much more likely to
occur.  It causes both threads involved in the deadlock to be frozen
instead of just one of them, so when things get unfrozen the race is
poised to occur.

No need, it seems pretty clear that this was the problem.

You're welcome.  I'll send the patch on up the line...
Greg, the patch I sent Mark is for 2.6.22-rc3.  It's different from the
corresponding patch for the USB development tree because of intervening
changes.  How would you like to handle this?  Should I send you both
versions of the patch?
