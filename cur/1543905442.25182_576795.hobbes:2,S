the one report that I saw said that the FPS numbers were overall the same, 
but what the reporter was seeing was that CFS was doing it in bursts of 
activity while SD was smoother. this wasn't enough to show up in the fps 
numbers being reported, but was enough to be unreasonable for gameing.
IIRC Linus responded with thoughts on granularity and the fact that 
changing from Hz 1000 to Hz 100 will increase the timeslices in CFS by 
10x (which could be enough to trigger this sort of issue)
