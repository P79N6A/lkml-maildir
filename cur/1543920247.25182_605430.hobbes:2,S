In hindsight I should have resent, but I didn't .. Really it's a matter
of frustration on my part. Where I submit patches that should be
included , but they are ignored for no clear reason .. Then I submit
again, and the patches are ignored again for no clear reason..
Comparing mainline and -rt isn't very interesting since , -rt has few
patches sent in against it .. Andrew is bound to loose a patch here and
there on accident, but -rt has so few patches sent in that we shouldn't
be loosing any.

That's a git tree tho , so apples and oranges ..

In all fairness you asked for links to patches, and that's is what I
gave you ..

Not sure what your getting at.. I specifically directed you to a patch.
I don't think that means you had to look for it, all you have to do was
include it ..
