It may also help to know that I did bisection search on 2.6.7-mm* that
had various contents of bk-input split out; in those, the offending
patch was revealed to be input-serio-sysfs-intergration.patch which
I think corresponds to:
# ChangeSet
#   2004/06/29 01:28:53-05:00 dtor_core@ameritech.net 
#   Input: serio sysfs integration
#   Signed-off-by: Dmitry Torokhov <dtor@mail.ru>
or one of the csets nearby in the consolidated bk-input.patch
