I don't know what a "proprietary solution" is, but what we had was a 
complete demonstration of the value of single level storage, in commercial 
use and everything,  and other computer makers (and other business units 
of IBM) stuck with their memory/disk split personality.  For 25 years, 
lots of computer makers developed lots of new computer architectures and 
they all (practically speaking) had the memory/disk split.  There has to 
be a lesson in that.

I don't know; I'm sure it's complicated.  But unless the stumbling block 
since 1980 has been that it was too hard to get/make a CPU with a 64 bit 
address space, I don't see what's different today.
