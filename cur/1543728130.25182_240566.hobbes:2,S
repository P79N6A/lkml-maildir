Not that my opinion is worth much, but this seems a very peculiar
interface to mimic.

Actually, I worked from the following description:
mbind(3)
	. . .
	nodemask is a bit field of nodes that contains up to
	maxnode bits.
	. . .
This very clearly indicates that I should pass the number of bits
in the nodemask field, not the number of bits plus one.
Granted, the man page makes it clear that I should use libnuma, but
in this case I was working on implementing a new MPOL_ROUNDROBIN, and
wanted to go directly to the system call for testing purposes.
And not to make things even more confusing, but the way things are
designed now, the value I need to pass to mbind() is numa_max_node()+2.
Very confusing.

Well, again, not that my opinion carries much weight (nor really should
it), but this whole off-by-one (or two) interface seems unnecessarily
confusing.  Is there no way we can get this fixed?  The temporary pain
of breaking the relatively new libnuma seems worth the price of getting
this forever cleaned up.
