Hello,
I'm trying to understand how Linux modules work basically reading a
documentation I got in Internet which has some gradually increasing
complexity examples. The examples are about how to communicate with a
character device and they use a function named "put_user" (to put the
message
in the kernel address space in the user address space).
When I try to insert the module using this function I get an error message
like
"bad_user_access_length" that I believe comes from a file called
"panic.c".
I know that the function is a macro defined in the file "segment.h" but I
don't know exactly how it works. 
Can somebody help me or give a little explanation or some reference books
that I could use?
Thans in advance!
