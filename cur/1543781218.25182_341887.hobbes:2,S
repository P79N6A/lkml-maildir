Color me skeptical. I've seen some weird bit flips and data corruption;
"paramters" to "paramEters" I could buy. But data corruption that
_inserts_ a hash mark a the beginning of a line of a header file? What
are the odds?

While that seems to point to the Rhine as the possible cause, I can't
see how any driver could possibly be involved in this.
