2.4.21-rc8-laptop1
Updated patches: swsusp, supermount, agpgart, drm, broadcom
New patches: acpi4asus, laptop_mode, sis-fb
Patch:  acpi-20030523 (www.sf.net/projects/acpi)
The ACPI in current kernels is very outdated. Most laptops won't have
any Powermanagement without the ACPI-Patch and some even won't boot.
Patch: swsusp-1.0_pre7 (www.sf.net/projects/swsusp)
Software Suspend makes hibernation possible in linux, which is a very
important feature for laptops.
Patch:  supermount-1.2.7 (
http://supermount-ng.sf.net
)
Supermount is a useful feature for desktop-pcs.
Patch:  agpgart from 2.4.21-rc7-ac1 (www.kernel.org)
Laptops with the Centrino chipset need this for working agpgart, which
is needed for hardware graphics acceleration (dri).
Patch:  drm modules from 2.4.21-rc7-ac1 (www.kernel.org)
This update is needed for proper working dri in XFree 4.3.
Patch:  radeonfb from Benjamin Herrenschmidt (rsync -avz
rsync.penguinppc.org::benh-devel/) Radeon 9000 won't work with radeonfb
found in the current kernel.
Patch:  bcm4400-2.0.2 + bcm5700-6.0.2 driver (from broadcom-ftp)
Needed for Broadcom Network cards found in many laptops.
Patch:  vivicam usb mass storage support (from Lycoris-Kernel)
Needed for Vivicam 355 (working as USB mass storage).
Patch:  acpi4asus-0.23 (www.sf.net/projects/acpi4asus)
Adds support for special acpi-events on asus-laptops.
Patch:  laptop_mode (www.sf.net/projects/swsusp)
Adds laptop_mode, which can save battery power.
Patch:  SiS framebuffer update (www.winischhofer.net)
Needed for some SiS-Cards.
Patch:  Optimization for pentium3/4 (trivial)
Makes gcc3-optimizations for pentium3/4 possible.
(Note: pentium4-optimizations should only be used with gcc 3.2.3 and
above. If you have an older gcc, please use pentium3.)
