'current' is guaranteed to not go away under you. (that is true on both UP
and SMP). There are certain structures within 'current' that have a
spinlock, the signal structures for example. The rule typically is that if
a structure is completely private to 'current' then you need no spinlock.
Shared fields (eg. 'priority' can be set from another process) have either
the lock_kernel() protection (old, not yet SMP-parallelized code), or some
own spinlock/counter like the signal struct. Does this answer your
question?
