Andries,
Just a thought...did you intend to use two slightly different types for 
major/minor? You say in nfs3xdr.c:
xdr_decode_fattr(u32 *p, struct nfs_fattr *fattr) 
 { 
...
	unsigned int type, major, minor; 
...
 	major = ntohl(*p++); 
	minor = ntohl(*p++); 
and later on in nfs4xdr.c:
	uint32_t major, minor; 
...
	READ32(major); 
	READ32(minor); 
I wonder if the real cause here is the different coding conventions of the two 
modules...
HTH, Shaheed
