Hi,
maybe some of you know my PPSkit that implements (among others) a new kernel clock 
with nanoseconds resolution for Linux 2.4 (i386). During that I tried to 
streamline the code a bit, specifically moving most clock stuff from timer.c and 
sched.c into time.c. You can make most of the NTP state variables static by doing 
so. I did restrict access to messing with the NTP variables that way, too.
Similarly timex.h should only contain NTP related stuff. Currently timex seems to 
be a "catch all" for add-ons. This mean that about any module includes timex.h, 
and upon changing a single NTP define, about 98% of the kernel are recompiled.
As I'm currently working on a merge of the updated NTP algorithms into 2.6, I 
thought I could ask for opinions here. (I'm not subscribed, so please CC: to me).
As I've done some work already, I'm going to present a patch snipplet that you may 
consider applying without great thought:
I really didn't understand what "if (unlikely(time_adjust < 0)) {" is trying to 
fix:

 	}
 
Also, I don't quite like the name "ntp_clear()": Is it a query, ot is it a 
command? I'd prefer "set_ntp_unsync()", beacsue it says very much what it's about. 
Likewise "ntp_synced()" might look like the opposite of "ntp_clear()" at first, 
but it's actually a query, thus I'd prefer something like "is_ntp_synced()". 
Actually it's "is_ntp_not_unsync()", but we only have binary logic here ;-)

Ulrich
