Yes, and after some investigation, I came up with two patches.  I'll queue 
both to you if that's ok, since they're dependent.
When lguest was being developed we didn't have a get_tsc_khz hook, so I had to 
kill the TSC cpuid bit.  Nowdays, the code can actually be much more natural: 
the Host tells us the cpu khz, and if it's zero, we fall back to the 
dumb "lguest" clock.
Thanks,
Rusty.
