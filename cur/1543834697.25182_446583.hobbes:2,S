The -stable team is suffering from travel lag right now (KS, OLS, and
then OSCON), and are still working out the infrastructure issues right
now.
I think that the next .16-stable kernel will probably come from Adrian,
but need to check my patch queue before I can be sure of this.
Anyway, yes, it's still in the plans, but the conference season is
slowing things down.  It should all be in place by next week.
Thanks for your patience.
