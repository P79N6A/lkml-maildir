Not quite.  This is an old problem dating back several years to early 2.4
times.  Back in the dark old days, ide-cs used to use the name "ide_cs" to
bind the driver to the device.  It now uses "ide-cs" for binding.
Make sure that "ide_cs" isn't mentioned in /etc/pcmcia/config - if it
is, change it to "ide-cs".
