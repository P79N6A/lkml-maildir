I'm for it, if you can get the code in the kernel.  If not, what are the 
arguments against doing this in userspace?
If you remember about 2 years ago, there was a thread which you started
about vesafbd.  From that, I've worked on vm86d which is a generic approach
to running BIOS code in user space. I stopped development on this though,
but it should be easy to revive. There is also vesafb-tng. I think it runs
BIOS code in kernel space.
The video BOOT code is also nice, especially for non-primary graphics cards.
