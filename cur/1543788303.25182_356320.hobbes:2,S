lets first check whether all the RT priorities are set up correctly for 
your audio setup. Could you send me your /proc/interrupts, your .config 
and the output of:
  ps -eo pid,pri,rtprio,cmd
there are lots of built-in methods in the -rt kernel to figure out the 
source of latencies. If the default methods do not show anything then 
worst-case we can activate the kernel's latency tracer to record the 
actual xrun critical path.
