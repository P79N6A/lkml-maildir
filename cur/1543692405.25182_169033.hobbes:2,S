Subject: Possible regression with 2.6.0-test6

I've noticed that test6 isn't as 'smooth' as test5.  Specifically, if I 
open an nedit window and use the cursor down key to scroll down through 
text, there is some jerkiness.  At this point I've noticed that CPU use 
goes to 1% or more.  A similar problem happens with Opera (web browser), 
but of course the CPU usage is higher, which is expected.
When I go back to test5, scrolling in nedit is smoother, and CPU never 
goes above 0.6%.  Note that the speed that text moves is the same in 
both, but the test6 version 'jumps' and 'stops' for a little bit.  Hence 
my describing it as jerky.
I know its not much to go on, but it is a noticable difference, at least 
to me.  Since this new release has tweaked interactivity patches, I'm 
wondering if this has anything to do with it.
System is a fully updated Mandrake 9.1, but I don't think that would 
matter.  CPU is P4-2.4GHz with 768 MB RAM, and NVidia video card.
