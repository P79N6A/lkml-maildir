When I boot linux on this system and there is a disk attached to the promise
connector, the system hard locks.  It finds the PDC20267 and the Via ide
chipsets (in that order) and freezes here.  It doesn't show anything else.
I tried kernels 2.4.18 and 2.4.19-pre10.
I also tried making ide a module, loading ide-mod.o freezes as well.
Removing the hdd from the controller and it boots just fine.  I tried a
Quantum fireball lct10 05 and a seagate st34311a with the same results.
The bios on the pdc controller is v1.31
