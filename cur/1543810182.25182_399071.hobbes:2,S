defintily not on sysfs.  sysfs doesn't allow drivers to modify the
file operations for good reasons.  it'll probably work the same as-is
when you use the rely file operations on debugfs or a custom filesystem,
although you're code will have zero chance to get merged when it modifies
an existing file operations struct or adds an ioctl.
