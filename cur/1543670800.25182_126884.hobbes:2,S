In light of our speaker sleeping through the meeting and
the fact that kernel hackers tend not to be awake early
in the morning I propose moving the time of the call to
1pm Pacific Time (GMT-0800). 
Originally we chose 9:30am to encourage people in Europe and 
India to attend. However, the time change has not increased 
attendance so I think we should move it to a more reasonable 
time for North American Continental dwellers who are the 
main attendees.
Any comments? Debate? Hate mail?
Send to me or lse-tech@lists.sf.net
