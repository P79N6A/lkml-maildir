When I got home yesterday, I found these messages on the console (I have
kernel messages and others echoed to vt8):
KERNEL: assertion (tp->copied_seq == tp->rcv_nxt) failed at
	tcp.c(1347):tcp_recvmsg
KERNEL: assertion (tp->copied_seq == tp->rcv_nxt) failed at
	tcp.c(1347):tcp_recvmsg
The first occurred at 2:15pm local time, and the other at 7:05pm local
time.  Functionality doesn't seem to be affected.
