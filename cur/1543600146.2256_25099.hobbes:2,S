Just want to add another situation. The previous post
about the system hang-up I suspected DRI module
related but it is not. It wont happen when I mount my
/dev/hda6 as ext2 (not ext3). The hang up happen when
I untar a tgz file (about 20Mb) to a loop device, loop
device attached to a 100Mb file in the ext3 partition.
And at the same time I untar the linux kenel from ext2
partition to ext3 partition. And I am playing Timidity
, running Mozilla. It is not swap related problem.
Hope that you may find it useful for your fix :-)
