Hi,
Seeing lots of these on a small server that hosts nfs shares (root and
"normal").
router:~ # dmesg | tail -n5
RPC request reserved 0 but used 96
RPC request reserved 0 but used 96
RPC request reserved 0 but used 140

I see nfs stalls on the client, doesn't seem to be directly related to
when the above messages happen.
