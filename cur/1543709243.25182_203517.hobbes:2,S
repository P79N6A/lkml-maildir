One of my hard disks recently failed again.  This time I got these
messages in the kernel log:
hdi: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x20
hdi: DMA timeout retry
hdi: timeout waiting for DMA
hdi: status error: status=0x00 { }
hdi: drive not ready for command
hdi: status error: status=0x00 { }
hdi: drive not ready for command
hdi: status error: status=0x00 { }
hdi: drive not ready for command
hdi: status error: status=0x00 { }
hdi: drive not ready for command
ide4: reset: success
hdi: task_out_intr: status=0x00 { }
hdi: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdi: drive not ready for command
hdi: recal_intr: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdi: DMA disabled
ide4: reset: master: error (0x00?)
hdi: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdi: no DRQ after issuing WRITE_EXT
ide4: reset timed-out, status=0xd0
end_request: I/O error, dev hdi, sector 183519345
raid1: Disk failure on md3, disabling device. 
	Operation continuing on 1 devices
What do these errors mean more precisely?  I'd like to know what
happened.  The disk doesn't reply anything meaningful to SMART
queries.  hdparm -C reports the disk state as "standby" even though
automatic spindown was not enabled and hdparm -I returns zeros for all
values.
This has happened several times with hdi, using different disks.  I
had the shop test one of the disks and got it replaced.  The other has
been working will on a different port of the same controller for
months.
In case it matters, these are Seagate Barracuda disks on an hpt374
controller.
