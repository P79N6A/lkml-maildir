Subject: [x86 setup 08/33] Define zero-page offset 0x1e4 as a scratch field, and use it
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/9/494

From: H. Peter Anvin <hpa@zytor.com>
The relocatable kernel code needs a scratch field for the decompressor
to determine its own location.  It was using a location inside
struct screen_info; reserve a free location and document it as scratch
instead.
