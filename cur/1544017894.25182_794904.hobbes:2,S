Not really, the "position" is actually only the current acceleration
read from the sensor minus the calibration vector. It's more wording
problem, nothing fancy like double integration ;-)

Nevertheless, this remark is still valid, there are various code that
all the accelerometer drivers could share. I'm thinking in particular of
the sysfs interface, and joystick interface. There has been some work in
this direction with the "industrialio" subsystem. So for now I'm in
"wait and see" mode about this :-)
See you,
