ok. i read part of the old thread now. sorry. didn't know that this had
already been issued.
so, based on the fact that
1. _most_ archs can easily do atomically.
2. those which don't aren't necessarily the better ones.
3. many drivers may prefer/be able to alloc through during
   _init()/_release()
3.5 some may not.
4. even on arm, __ioremap() takes a gfp for quite some time now 
   and nobody seems to disagree.
then why does pci_alloc_consistent() not just take gfp flags and people
put in what their personal preference is?

dns
