So could O_STREAMING be included in 2.4, and let people do things like
#if 2.4
	fcntl(...O_STREAMING...)
#else
	posix_fadvise()
#endif
Or, if fadvise just fails with error code in 2.4, 
	if (fadvise()<0)
		fcntl(O_STREAMING)
Or even:
	fadvise()
	fcntl(O_STREAMING):
and let whatever succeed...
Or is it too dirt ?
TIA
