GIT v1.5.0.1 Release Notes
==========================
Fixes since v1.5.0
------------------
* Documentation updates
  - Clarifications and corrections to 1.5.0 release notes.
  - The main documentation did not link to git-remote documentation.
  - Clarified introductory text of git-rebase documentation.
  - Converted remaining mentions of update-index on Porcelain
    documents to git-add/git-rm.
  - Some i18n.* configuration variables were incorrectly
    described as core.*; fixed.
* Bugfixes
  - git-add and git-update-index on a filesystem on which
    executable bits are unreliable incorrectly reused st_mode
    bits even when the path changed between symlink and regular
    file.
  - git-daemon marks the listening sockets with FD_CLOEXEC so
    that it won't be leaked into the children.
  - segfault from git-blame when the mandatory pathname
    parameter was missing was fixed; usage() message is given
    instead.
  - git-rev-list did not read $GIT_DIR/config file, which means
    that did not honor i18n.logoutputencoding correctly.
* Tweaks
  - sliding mmap() inefficiently mmaped the same region of a
    packfile with an access pattern that used objects in the
    reverse order.  This has been made more efficient.
