Thanks again Arnd.  I did that yesterday and got it working last night!  
The only thing I have questions about are:
1) Since this is for a quasi realtime application, is there any 
advantage to using the interrupt line regarding how the CPU spends its 
idle time waiting for the flash?  (I have an interrupt line I can use.)  
Currently I am not sending in the IRQ resource, resource array length of 
2, not 3.
2) I am getting this message during boot up:  "Driver 'sd' needs 
updating - please use bus_type methods".   Again this is kernel 2.6.26.  
It seems like this can be safely ignored, but if its easy to get rid of 
that I would be happy to back port a patch.
I really appreciate your help.
