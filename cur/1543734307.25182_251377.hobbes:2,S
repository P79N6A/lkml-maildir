Generally though I think you could expect the lru lock to be most
often taken by the scanner by node local CPUs. Even on the big
systems. We'll see.

Sure. And when you fill it with pages, they'll use up 32KB of dcache
by using a single 64B line per page. Now that you've blown the cache,
when you go to move those pages to another list, you'll have to pull
them out of L2 again one at a time.
OK, so a 511 item pagevec is pretty unlikely. How about a 64 item one
with 128 byte cachelines, and you're touching two cachelines per
page operation? That's 16K.
