It depends on the machine. For a server the thing you need to feed clients
is throughput. I don't see how feeding the data slower is going to be GOOD
for latency. Particularly servers which push a lot of data, like mail and
news or certain web sites, need to push it now.
Latency is more of an issue for end user machines.
