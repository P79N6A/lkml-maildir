One more possibility:
	cmp	r0, #(TASK_SIZE - (1<<24))
I.e. just compare against the largest constant that can be
represented.  For accesses to the last part of userspace, it's a
penalty of 4 instructions -- but it might work out to be a net gain.
Actually, since the shortest path is only three instructions in the
fast case, not counting control flow, it might be good to inline those
3 in uaccess.h, and change the "bl" to a conditonal "blhi" there.

Ah.  I was guessing the mnemonic.
That's because of the way "ge" is used on ARM26 in places, which
therefore look buggy or subtly clever:
        ldr     r1, [r1, #TI_ADDR_LIMIT]
        sub     r1, r1, #4
        cmp     r0, r1
        bge     __get_user_bad
        cmp     r0, #0x02000000
4:      ldrlst  r1, [r0]
        ldrge   r1, [r0]
"ge" is a signed comparison, and unsigned is needed here, unless I
missed something subtle.  So "bge" and "ldrge" should be "bhi" and "ldrhi".
