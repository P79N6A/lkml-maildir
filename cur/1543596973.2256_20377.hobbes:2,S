hi Mike,
i tried that already on a 2.2.18 kernel and
num_physpages is not
exported. num_physpages does not contain the
actual RAM present
in the system.
i booted up my linux with command line parameter
mem=32M,
but my machine actually had 128M RAM. and from KDB
i inspected
num_physpages which showed me only 32M
thanx
