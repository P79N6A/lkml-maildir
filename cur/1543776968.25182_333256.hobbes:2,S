unless you declare a fuction:
int*
function_style_for_easy_grep(...)
{
	...
}
I like this style because I can grep for ^function_style_for_easy_grep
and quickly find function def.
int
*function_style_for_easy_grep(...) ..
would make it harder.

I use sizeof(a) always (both for sizeof(type) and sizeof(expr)).

What's wrong with if(expr) ? Rationale?

Avoid this. If needed, use a temporary. Save a few brain cells of poor reader.

Disagree. Common case of hard-to-notice bug:
	if(foo)
		bar()
...after some time code evolves into:
	if(foo)
		/*
		 * Wee need to barify it, or else pagecache gets foobar'ed
		 */
		bar();
...after some more time:
	if(foo)
		/*
		 * Wee need to barify it, or else pagecache gets foobar'ed.
		 * Also we need to bazify it.
		 */
		bar();
		baz();
Thus we may be better to slighty encourage use of {}s even if they are
not needed:
	if(foo) {
		bar();
	}

This is a porting nightmare waiting to happen.
Why dont we have ptr_t instead?

hugeint or hugeint_t
And also irqflags_t for spinlock_irqsave(&lock, flags),
jiffies_t for jiffies.

? did you mean struct foo (*foo_bar_handler)(... or  struct foo* foo_bar_handler(...
