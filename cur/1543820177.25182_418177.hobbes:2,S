A regression in the ALSA driver compared to the OSS driver was reported 
as ALSA bug #1520, so let's keep the OSS driver for now.

+	  Say Y here if you have a card based on the Crystal CS4232 chip set,
+	  which uses its own Plug and Play protocol.
+
+	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
+	  "cs4232=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<mpuio>,<mpuirq>" to the kernel
+	  command line.
+
+	  See <file:Documentation/sound/oss/CS4232> for more information on
