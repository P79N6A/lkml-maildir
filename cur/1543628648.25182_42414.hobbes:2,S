ABSOLUTELY NOT!
"extern inline" does not guarantee inlining. It only guarantees that _if_
the code isn't inlined, it also won't be compiled as a static function.
Complain to the gcc guys, they've made up some not-backwards-compatible
thing called "always_inline" or something, apparently without any way to
know whether it is supported or not.
