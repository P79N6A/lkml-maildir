Hello Christophe,
The trick is to write a proxy.
You redirect all _external_ packets of port 80 on this machine.
Then you set up some processes, binding to the addresses of all _real_
interfaces, leaving out loopback. If a packet arrives (in this case a
socket) then look if it's for a local Web server or a remote.
If it's for a remote, proxy it with a proxy request.
If it's local, hand it over to your local apache.
Configure apache for 127.0.0.1:80 and _NOT_ for general port 80.
The tricks lie 
  o in the fact that getsockname returns the _original_ destination
    address, not (as expected) my own.
  o in specifying 127.0.0.1:80 in the apache config. file
  o in deciding if it's a local or remote address (endless loop).
One public available program is transproxy-0.4 from someone in
australia, I don't remember the URL. If you want to have the source
I'll mail it, it's only 15k.
The transparent proxy that does those things mentioned above is
(unfortunately) not public available. You can get a free demoCD image of a
firewall from our Canadian distributor comspec.com, I will mail you the
exact URL if you're interested (if you can burn it for yourself) and you
can look how that specialized proxy works after logging in. Look at the
ipchains rules and into the apache configuration file.

Frank
