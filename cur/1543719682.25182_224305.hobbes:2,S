Are we?
I don't see any point where we cast any function pointers to anything 
else.
We cast data pointers all over the place, but that is actually guaranteed
to work in C for some "large enough" integer type, and "unsigned long" is
pretty much it. 
And even function pointers should be safeish. The fact that some broken
architecture (can you say "ia64"?) has totally idiotic calling conventions
and requires the caller to load the GP value is _their_ problem. The
architecture will either die or hide the fact that it's being silly. For
now it's hiding it.
Repeat after me: practice is more important than theory. A _lot_ more 
important.
