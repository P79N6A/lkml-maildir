Hi Michal,
             Thanks. I checked the udev version and it is 068. Meanwhile, what 
I did was I booted into 2.6.13-15 and
zcat /proc/config.gz > $(KERN_SOURCEDIR_2.6.17.1)/
and then ran 
make xconfig.
Ofcourse there were some CONFIG options that were present in 2.6.13-15 and 
missing in 2.6.17.1 and vice versa but once I resolved those and built the 
kernel, udev seems to be working. So I did not upgrade udev to 071 but still 
it works. I think there should be some CONFIG option that I am missing. I am 
not sure which one. 
Thanks again,
-Romit
