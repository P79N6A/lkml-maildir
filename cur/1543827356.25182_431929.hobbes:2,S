Greetings,
    I would like to get a list of all the optical drives registered. I 
see that in <linux/cdrom.h> there is a register_cdrom() function, and an 
unregister variant. Nowhere do i see however a way to get  a list of 
these devices. I understand that they form a linked list, so getting the 
first one would be peachy enough, yet again I can't find such 
functionality. Currently what I'm doing is parsing the text out of 
/proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info, which is cumbersome. However due to the fact 
that a file in proc can produce this, i assume there's a way to get that 
list. How may I do so? All i need are the device names so that I may 
send some ioctls to them.
Thank you.
P.S.
