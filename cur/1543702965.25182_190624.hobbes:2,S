I assume this breaks Brian Raiter's tiny ELF executables[1]. Even
though these binaries are evil hacks that don't comply to standards
and serve no serious purpose, I'm not sure what the purpose of the
sanity checks is. Are there any risks associated with running
non-compliant ELF executables? (Now that I mention it, the
proof-of-concept exploit for the brk() hole comes to mind, but I don't
know offhand if that did anything against the spec.) I don't mean to
question the usefulness of your work, especially as I don't know much
about ELF, but I'm personally curious about why you think additional
sanity checks are worth a slight increase in code complexity.
