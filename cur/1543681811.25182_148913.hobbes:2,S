I don't know, really.  I've asked this of Andries several times and either
he doesn't know either, or I didn't understand the answer.
But there have been no problems with the code in -mm for a couple of months.

The fact that the code has not been tested on ppc and, presumably, several
other platforms is a problem, but I guess that'll work itself out.
The situation at present is that Linus will take the patches, but I ain't
sending them because viro has expressed oblique concerns over the approach.
 I'd like to get his take on it before proceeding.  But he has vanished
again.  However I do expect that he'll get a chance to review and comment on the
changes soon.
The other concern is the unknown amount of followup work which is needed. 
All I can say there is that the kernel will continue to work in the areas
which have been exercised by testers of the -mm kernels.
I expect we'll end up just jamming it in and seeing what happens.
