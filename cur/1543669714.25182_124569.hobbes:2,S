It's still in the journal stage. 2 reasons lead me to believe this:
1. if I hit ^c then mount does the journal recovery (and does it
   quick-smart - the hd light is on full-force during this)
2. the progress bar that comes up during a full fsck is not displayed.

I've compiled 1.32+1.33-WIP-2003.03.30 (debian e2fsprogs from sid). I'll
install that now.

I'll try to remember to do this when my laptop loses power again (it
happens often - power connector is wonky). Don't wanna do it right now
cos I have the connector in just the right spot so that the laptop is
actually getting power.

Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some
of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi.
No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."
