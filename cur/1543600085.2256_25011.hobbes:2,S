Hmm. Bad style, but acceptable if you never do it again :-)
[I mean: as soon as we start using more than 16 mount flags
we have the top 16 bits, but only 2^16 - 1 values are available
since 0xc0ed is a conventional value; now if the bits are
completely independent then it is strange to forbid one
particular random combination, and it is cleaner to use
only 15 bits with 2^15 values. If the top bit is never used
from user space then it is available for internal purposes.]
