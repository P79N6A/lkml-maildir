Not necessarily. Just make sure you allocate those numbers intelligently -  
which should be fairly easy: have everybody who needs a number request it  
from a global allocator at initialization time.
That way, you can also try to do something more or less intelligent (like  
doing a printk and starting over) when you run out of numbers, as you  
would sooner or later if you really used unsigned char, aka 256 numbers  
max.
You could even automate that by reserving one value for "no number  
assigned", and then when trying to access a queue you notice you have no  
value assigned, depending on what you want to do, either take this as  
equivalent to an empty queue, or go allocate a value - this way, unused  
devices don't occupy queue numbers.
No static numbers anywhere to keep track of.
And it's easy to encapsulate so that code remains correct when minor/major  
type sizes, or queue number type sizes, change (except for the allocation  
routines themselves).

All such a function could do would be aliasing devices together. You can  
get that effect by defining a per-major bitmask to and with the device  
number before indexing the queue number table - I assume that every device  
on a major would want to use the same level of aliasing (typically, one  
queue per disk drive), and that ought to mean the same bit mask for all  
devices on one major.
What did I miss?
