Read it yourself.
The requirements listed at 
http://reality.sgi.com/mjk/direct/node7.html
include this show-stopper:
: A context-switchable graphics engine. The state of the graphics
: hardware must be context-switchable and the context switch must be
: able to be performed preemptively, including in the middle of a command.
There are several other serious problems, including the implicit
assumption that graphics hardware will enforce security.
On a PC or Mac, everybody with graphics access can get root.
I suppose that isn't any worse than Windows 98...
No thank you. We can forget about this joke and just use KGI.
Note that the GGI library certainly can feed a graphics pipeline
if you have one available. The use of KGI does not prevent good
support for the weird features of SGI hardware.
