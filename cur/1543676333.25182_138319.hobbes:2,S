Thanks for your answer, I guess not many people understand some of
these things.
So...if I'm not allowed to read the link, wouldn't it be a bug
for the permissions to claim it is group/other readable?
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            0 Jun  5 22:29 /proc/2/exe
Exactly "what" is determining the permissions on the ability to read
the link if not the file permissions?
Should it read?
lrwx------    1 root     root            0 Jun  5 22:29 /proc/2/exe

	Yeah...it could be a mess, but wouldn't you be guaranteed that it
would be a zero terminated string?

	Well that "could" be handled by an attempt to stat the target in
the user's context and see if the file can be reached through the
directory chain, but hey, what's the point of consistency, anyway?
"Isn't it consistency is the foolish hobgoblin of small minds?"  Er,
something like that....

	So if the process could muck with it, like path, then if it was
able to switch back to ROOT, wouldn't that be a security risk?

some more primitive unix clones (cygwin for example) don't have
such luxuries....now that I mention it....it doesn't have an 'exe'
entry under proc either...*snort*.
Nevermind....:-)
