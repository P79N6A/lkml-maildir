Not just Intel motherboards. There is 32 bits of address-space.
This needs to be shared between RAM and the I/O addresses of
PCI/Bus and AGP boards. Unfortunately, the PCI/AGP specification
wastes a lot of address space because something that needs 1 megabyte
of address-space must sit on a 1 megabyte boundary.  If this
comes after something that used 128 bytes, there is nearly a megabyte
wasted to get to the next boundary. A megabyte here a megabyte there..
pretty soon you are talking about a lot of wasted address-space.
Solution: A 64 bit machine will have the same problem, you end up
wasting RAM address space if it overlays PCI/Bus space. But, you
probably would never opt for a gazzzilion bytes of RAM anyway?
	One gazzzilion = 1844 6744 0737 0955 1615  (2 ^ 64)
Just don't put 4 gigs of RAM in a 4 gig address-space and expect
to use it all. Sell the spare 2 gigs or build another PC with it!
