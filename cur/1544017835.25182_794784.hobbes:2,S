Yes, but I can see a potential problem. If we have subsystem foo and bar,
and both of them have a control file with exactly the same name, like
foo.stat & bar.stat. Now we mount them with -o noprefix, and then one
of the stat file will fail to be created, without any warnning or notification
to the user.
