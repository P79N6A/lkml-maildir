It also mishandles array of longs.
But seriously I wouldn't bother - the syscall interface is deprecated anyways
and has been for a long time. The only sysctl that needs to be handled
is (CTL_KERN,KERN_VERSION) [used by glibc], the others are not needed
and I hoep to eventually remove them even natively.

P.S.: Andrew I just discovered you removed the printk code for this.
That's not good, how are users supposed to know it's deprecated?
