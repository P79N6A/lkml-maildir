humm... no C3 state here :) did you mean this C3?
# cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power
active state:            C2
max_cstate:              C8
bus master activity:     00000000
states:
    C1:                  type[C1] promotion[C2] demotion[--] latency[000] usage[00007790]
   *C2:                  type[C2] promotion[--] demotion[C1] latency[010] usage[02310093]

Now that filesystem problems have gone I have longer uptimes. OhOhOh,
very funnny, echoing tsc into the mentioned sysfs entry makes the clock
almost completely stop:
# date
Mon Jan 16 21:29:26 CET 2006
now count with me 1..2..3..4..5
# date
Mon Jan 16 21:29:27 CET 2006
I'd say the time is far from being accurate.

seems you're right, issuing a 'sleep 1' takes ages before it returns and
it's exactely where the boot process got stuck.

I'll be happy to test new patches if necessary (I'm running -mm4)
