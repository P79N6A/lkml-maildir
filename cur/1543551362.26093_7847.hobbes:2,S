If this is true, I am very much interested in the resultant patch
(to vanilla 2.2.17 or 2.2.18pre15) since I have the same load, and the

Unfortunatelly this is not to blame gcc for:
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
