So do I. While there is a language barrier, the Hitachi folks,

Great, because I believe all those involved would like to see this
happen. I personally am convinced that none of those involved want
to continue wasting their time in parallel.

Yes, I do so believe that this is what you most sincerely think. And
I'm ok with that. We don't have to approach the problem from the
same direction. In my view we should at least settle for working on
the most basic thing we *do* agree on: having a markup mechanism for
necessary instrumentation.

I genuinely understand your concern. And I repeat that ltt's initial
design cared little of the provenance of the events. It just needed
key events to present an intelligent picture to the user. The
patches have since grown to include stuff which was essential as
development went ahead. But there's no reason things cannot be
refactored into an acceptable format to all by review on the lkml.

Again, I strongly believe that this issue isn't about static vs.
dynamic. The goal, and that's what's important, is to allow users
to have access to a set of tools they can use on *any* kernel
they get their hands on, without having to edit anything anywhere
or fix any script. For having spent considerable effort into this,
I don't see any other way that using static markup. Here's a
simple case: you ask someone who's got a bug report on a kernel
crashing because of his user-space realtime task, and you ask him
to dump you a trace, and that trace actually ends up misleading
because his out-of-tree instrumentation was inserted in the wrong
location.
Again, the goal is to obtain tools that users can use on *any*
kernel they get their hands on.

No, I'm saying that the flexibility of the markup is not tied to the
instrumentation "grab" mechanism (direct call or binary editing.)
That's the "arbitrary" I'm talking about.
