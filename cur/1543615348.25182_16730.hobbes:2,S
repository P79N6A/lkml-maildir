I would appreciate any expert insight into a problem that is causing me 
considerable grief.  Please cc to me directly.  Thank you very much.
Problem:  kswapd, kreclaimd, kupdated push load average high during simple
tar.  Response of system drops such that even keystroke echos are
noticeably delayed.
Specifics:
Machine- 4 processor 700Mhz Dell with 4G Ram and 6G swap space running
stock Redhat 7.2 distribution.  All disks are SCSI using ext2.
Command- from a remote machine this command is executed to the Linux 
machine "tar cBf - . | rsh linux "(tar xBpf -)".
Manifestion of problem- As this command continues on a freshly booted 
Linux machine the free memory reported by 'top' slowly goes to a low 
number.  When it bottoms out, the processes 'kswapd', 'kreclaimd', and 
'kupdated' begin to run pushing the load average above 4 at times.  
Responsiveness of machine drops dramatically with even keystroke echos 
delayed for seconds.
I apologize if this is well known.  If there is a simple solution I would 
appreciate even a terse pointer to it.  Thanks.
