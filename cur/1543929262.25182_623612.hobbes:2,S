I'd be tempted to merge that since it's documentation-only,
and I like to see such stuff merged ASAP.  But otherwise
it's non-essential.

Non-essential.

The first one fixes some minor bugs, so would be good to merge.
The second does minor associated cleanup ... non-essential.

The fix to the compile error is in the next-to-last of these.
Bryan says they're highly interdependent, and they also
include quite a number of bugfixes (some "critical") that
have been used in Analog's treee for many months now.
That makes sense to me, since they've been bouncing around
for quite a while now.  I'd be OK with merging all of them;
if something breaks, it'd be no worse than the current state
(and would only affect Blackfin).

Those can wait; they're performance updates.

I'd say all those Blackfin patches should go, and the one
calling convention patch, are appropriate as bugfixes.
And the doc patch, unless there's a reason to hold it back.
