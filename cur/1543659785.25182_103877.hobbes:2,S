    Hi Jon :)

    Yes, but you still need a mountpoint. Lot of worries for
something as trivial and useless as changing the ps identity ;))

    /proc/self/exe doesn't need to be in procfs... If proc is not
mounted... Anyway it was just an example. The degree of evil-user
intrusion in a machine for doing something like that is quite high.
There are simpler ways of attacking a machine if you can forge
/proc/self/exe :))

    My init refuses to run if not called by the superuser ;) because
I think the same as you and anyway my init doesn't need a shutdown
command, it works with a keycombo that root controls.
