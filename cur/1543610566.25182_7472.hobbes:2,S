This is definately likely, the machine has a cheap no-name memory
module in it.

This is another factoid for my notebook. :)

I cannot reproduce this, i've tried stressing the filesystem but the
oops does not show up. I will cc you if one shows up again.
I've tried memtest86 on the machine, and while it doesn't spot any
errors, it does seem to take an extremly long time to do some of the
tests (The default tests are taking more than 12 hours). I will replace
the memory with some decent branded ram just in case.
Thanks for your time Stephen,
