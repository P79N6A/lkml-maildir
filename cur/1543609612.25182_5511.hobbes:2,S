   drivers/net/bonding.c has #include <limits.h>, exposing the kernel to
   user space dependencies.  It must be removed.
   I could not find a maintainer for this beast so cc'ed to seevral users
   in the changelog.
Documentation/networking/bonding.txt says:
Current developement on this driver is posted to:
 - 
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/bonding/
But I've made the fix and sent it off to Linus for you :)
Franks a lot,
