Greg,
I think nowadays most people that read lkml use lkml.org or comparable 
services. And lkml.org does not show the subject in the thread list.
But, well, I guess that's more of an issue for lkml.org to do something 
about because it really is about navigating mail threads.
and... -ENOPATCH for quilt.
So no more comments from me and I go in search of a different webservice 
that allows to read lkml with mail subjects in the navigation.
