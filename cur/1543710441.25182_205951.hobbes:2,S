I cannot do it lazily unfortunately because the paging routine will
start from the page, so if the page is not uptodate it will go to
read into nirvana.

correct, though I will have to change that for the above problem ;(
Well, another way is to just do the pagetable walk and fixup the
page->as.vma to be a page->as.anon_vma during split/merge (actually
merge is already taken care of by forbidding merging in the interesting
cases, what I missed was the split, oh well ;). But preallocating the
anon_vma is such a little cost that it should be a lot better than
slowing down the split.
