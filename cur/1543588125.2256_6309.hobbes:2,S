Duh, mea stupida.  I misread your message.  You're trying to get 
the Promise IDE working at 100, no?  My Asus A7V133 has the 686b 
which does ATA100 without having to rely on the Promise chipset, 
and that seems to work fine. But if it helps to know, I've got an 
A7V with the 686a and I use the PDC20265 for my ATA100 drive. It 
boots with a message that says it's doing UDMA(100):
hde: 80041248 sectors (40981 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, 
CHS=79406/16/63, UDMA(100)
But /proc/ide/pdc202xx says:
                    PDC20265 Chipset.

DMA Mode:       UDMA 4
Shouldn't that be UDMA 5?

I have the same motherboard, and it works fine for me.  Note the
80w cable detection.  Perhaps you've got a bad cable?
