Hello.
Got here 
http://pciids.sourceforge.net/iii/?i=105a3319
As 
http://linux.yyz.us/sata/faq-sata-raid.html#tx4
 calls it 
soft/accelerator raid version
Going to use latest kernel from /pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/
But bios even with keyboard unplugged requires me to press one of 2 keys 
to either define array OR continue booting in case no array is defined.
What would you recommend me to do?
- stay with ft3xx module from promise  and 10 level RAID array and not use 
sata_promise?
- define some array in bios and completely ignore that fact and use 
sata_promise, bypass bios and define custom linux soft raid arrays?
- anything else (no bios flashing and no hw hacking)?
AlL.
please CC me... but anyway if you forget i will have a look into archive.
