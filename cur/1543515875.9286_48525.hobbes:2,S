Easy.  The kernel doesn't send you 5,000 signals.  If the
signal queue starts overflowing, it gives up and sends you
a single SIGIO, and you call poll().  
The signal model gives you the best of both worlds: low overhead
when only a few fd's at a time need attention (no linear scan), 
and low overhead when they all do (same as old poll() method,
but with the extra overhead of a single SIGIO).
sct must be sleeping, or he would have answered like this, I think :-)
