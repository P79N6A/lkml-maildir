Why not get the signature from the .tar file, that way the compression
method doesn't matter?  This is how Source Mage does it's checking, we
create and md5sum (and soon GPG) signature based on the uncompressed .tar
file.  This way, you can use any compression you want, even changing
around the compression to your favourite one, and the signatures will
always match.  :)
