You don't want to use such an memset unlike you're clearing areas
which are significantly bigger than all your cache (>several MB)
The problem is that the instruction that avoid write-allocate usually also force 
the result out of cache. And for small data sets that is typically a loss
if you want to use the data later, because the later use eats full cache misses.
In the kernel such big buffers occur only very rarely, most operations are on
4K and less. For those only in cache operation is interesting.
