As Scott Ferris pointed out, the main reason for deadlock in sfnet was
blocking behavior of page cache when daemon tried to do filesystem IO,
namely syslog(). That was 2.4.x kernel. We don't know whether it is
fixed in 2.6.x. If someone knows, please let us know. Meanwhile we came
up with work-around design in user-space. "Paged out" problem fixed
already in our subversion repository by utilizing mlockall() syscall.
Also we have IMHO, working solution for OOM during ERL=0 TCP re-connect.
