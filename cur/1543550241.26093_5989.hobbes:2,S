Debian have been shipping an alternative compilers to do kernel builds for
a couple of years at least. So now they are using 2.2 it makes a lot of sense
to spot it, and ditto with any others who do the same. If everyone could have
agreed a name for the kernel compiler that would be even better.
As to compatibility I am told by folks working on the gnu C/C++ that library
level compatibility should be 100% between 2.96+ and 3.0 while 2.95 is an
isolated incompatible pseudo-release at C++ level.
My own interest in this is the LSB, where the inability of the Gnu C++ folks
to have a defined binary standard is preventing standardisation of any C++
interfaces - both base classes and high level stuff.
