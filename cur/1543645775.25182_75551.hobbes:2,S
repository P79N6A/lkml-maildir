Ave kernel people.
I did a little bit further testing with kernel 2.5.40.  I made a very
very lean kernelconfig. No ide/scsci/preemp/nfsroot/ etc etc. With
that config the kernel can only boot,setup basic stuff   and than
complain it can't find a root filesys :) The configfile can be found
at cam029208.student.utwente.nl/~caligula/kernel along with a
lspci.txt of the test pc and a dmesg of the last working 2.5 kernel
(2.5.31) wich works with lloadlin on that test pc.
I build 3 kernels:zdisk,zImage and bzImge. All with gcc 2.95.3 and 
all with the same lean kernelconfig.
Results:
1) zdisk -->booting fine from floppy,stops when it can't find a
rootfilesystem. which is obvious since no ide/scsci
/nfsroot/ramdisk/initrd  is compiled in. So thumbs up with this setup.
2)loadin + zImage --> loadlin loads kernel from hard disk,starts
unzipping . The dots which indicate the progress keeps going,until ...
whush,black screen followed by soft reboot.
3)loadlin +bzImage -->same symptoms as loadlin+zimage.
The same setup works flawless with 2.4.x and 2.5.x <=2.5.31
So now the questions. What did change from .31 to .32 wich could have
influenced the interaction of loadin with the kernel? And how can I
debug this?  I'm no coder but turning on debugging code with #defines
is in my reach.
