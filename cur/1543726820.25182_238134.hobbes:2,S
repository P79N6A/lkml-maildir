Once CPUs other than 0 are enabled, they take part in the boot
process. They don't spin forever so I don't understand the notion
of 'boot CPU'.
Also firmware has no clue about what CPU is tickling it. There is no
possible way for it to find out, or even care. If some hardware
engineer claimed differently, he/she/it is pulling your chain (or
needs to learn how busses, CPUs and FPGAs work)! There is a
Virtual Wire specification that guarantees that no firmware
can possibly care.
