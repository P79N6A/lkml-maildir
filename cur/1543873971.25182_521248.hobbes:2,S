But with lguest, VMI and kvm I don't think that's a good idea.
For background: the current patching code is ugly too, but it only deals
with the 6 most common functions, so it's contained.  This gets us
pretty close to !CONFIG_PARAVIRT performance.  (But slowdown is still
measurable).
We get worse with Xen wanting to alter mkpte et al.  By the time we
patch another 6 functions (each one slightly different), we get pretty
close to general coverage anyway, so it's clearer to do them all.
I think the question is, can we do it better than this?  My previous
attempts (which lead to the current code) ranged from ugly to very ugly
