I suspect that a lot of the heat comes from the assertion that Linux won't
"succeed".  Whatever that means.  I look at several million users and
rapid expansion into new markets, and I think, "waddia mean, won't
succeed?  Linux has already succeeded."
This whole thing probably ought to be dragged over to
comp.os.linux.advocacy.
