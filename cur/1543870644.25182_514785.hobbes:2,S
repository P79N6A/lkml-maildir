Quite possibly. Taking software zones from the other large mail I sent,
one could get the 64MB effect by increasing MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES to be 64MB
in pages. To avoid external fragmentation issues, I'd prefer of course
if these container zones consisted of mainly contiguous memory but with
anti-fragmentation, that would be possible.

It would be fixable, especially if containers do their own reclaim on their
container zones and not kswapd. Writing dirty data back periodically would
still need to be global in nature but that's no different to today.
