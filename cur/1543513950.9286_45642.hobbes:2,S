Is there maybe some way of loading some 2nd level module with only functions
exported for this kind of reason?
With such an beast it would be not-so-bad with binary onlys. I know if i
wanted to do an binary-only module, that would be what i wanted. So i don't
have to recompile major parts if anything changes. Just the wrapper part.
If i'm totally out in the blue (wich i usually am) can somebody explain why
that should be an bad idea (except for the memory and loadtime overhead?)
