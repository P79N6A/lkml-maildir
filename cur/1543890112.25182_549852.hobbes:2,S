This /mostly/ works - I've had my test machine cycling through a suspend 
cycle every 10 seconds for the past hour without any difficulties 
providing I unload USB first. If USB is loaded, the suspend occasionally 
fails with one of the devices returning -EBUSY and causing it to be 
aborted. I haven't looked into this in any detail yet, but it's 
presumably sufficiently generic code that it's potentially biting people 
on PPC anyway.
