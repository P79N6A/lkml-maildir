2.4.18.
I tried the suggestion in this thread:
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100912381726661&w=2
It made no difference.  I also looked through the messages on
linux-usb-devel, but they seem to be more related to having USB floppies
or USB hard drives recognized, instead of network cards, which I believe
is my problem.  The kernel decides that there aren't any network devices,
so it doesn't do IP autoconfiguration, which is how it does NFS root in my
case.
In the output while booting, after it says:
Root-NFS: No NFS server available, giving up.
VFS: Unable to mount root fs via NFS, trying floppy.
VFS: Insert root floppy and press ENTER
hub.c: USB new device connect on bus2/1, assigned device number 2
pegasus.c: eth0: D-Link DSB-650
There is no perceptible delay between these messages, so it seems like the
code to detect the USB devices executes after the IP autoconfig section,
which is what is preventing this from working.
Is this a topic that should be discussed on one of the linux-usb lists
instead of linux-kernel?
Thanks.
