You'd better start hashing that API out on the list yesterday.

And this one.

And possibly this. Is this transparency of some form?.

It only doesn't complicate VFS because we haven't discussed generalizing
it yet. The desire to do transactional processing is not unique to Reiser
any more than journalling is. See recent thread about fsync and MTAs.
If you hide all your nifty features under a carpet (aka ioctl) where no
one but Viro notices them, then maybe you'll be able to push this stuff
late September and get them in. But FS-specific syscalls are a non-starter
- what happens to the second FS that decides it wants transactions or
multi-file I/O but doesn't quite fit your model?
