Subject: unregister_netdevice(): negative refcnt, suggest patch against 2.6.11

Hi lkml-members,
I recently had a problem with appletalk. After starting atalkd on a TAP
interface and stopping it later, unregister_netdevice() just stated
| unregister_netdevice: waiting for tap0 to become free. Usage count = -1
So I assume there is a problem in the appletalk code, but I didn't try
reproducing that on other systems so far.
I changed my kernel to "correct" a negative refcnt to 0 and that kind
of fixes the problem. I'm not sure whether this could break anything,
but certainly waiting for a device to become free is no use when there
is a negative number of users, so I think it would be better to allow
the system to shut down cleanly in this case.
Here's m suggestion:
