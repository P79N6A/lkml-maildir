The only support the kernel should and currently does provide for this 
hardware is the "radeon" drm module. I believe the X300 is an R3xx core, so 
you might find it's supported minimally in the current Xorg release 
(6.9.0/7.0.0). My Mobility Radeon 9600 seems to work fine with this 
combination.
Alternatively you may want to look into running ATI's proprietary driver 
(fglrx). Both are compatible with 2.6.14.
