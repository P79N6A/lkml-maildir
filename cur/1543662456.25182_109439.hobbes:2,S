What would help a lot of people (certainly me, at least), would be if
somebody kept a well-publicized "already known errata" list along with
(possibly unofficial) work-around patches.  Something along the line of:
compile fails in drivers/widget/fooby.c with error:
undefined structure member 'blat' in line 1149.
To fix:   apply <this patch>

Almost but not quite what I meant - unless -BK1 is reserved for after-release
whoops and doesn't contain "new stuff for release N+1".   If -BK1 is only
bugfixes, that would be good.
