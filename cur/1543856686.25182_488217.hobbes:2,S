It is useless for memory unplug until we implement limits for unmovable 
pages in a zone (per MA_ORDER area? That would fit nicely into the anti 
frag scheme) or until we have logic that makes !GFP_MOVABLE allocations 
fall back to a node that is not removable.

There are numerous other uses as well (besides DIMM and node unplug):
1. Faulty DIMM isolation
2. Virtual memory managers can reduce memory without resorting to 
   balloons.
3. Physical removal and exchange of memory while a system is running
   (Likely necessary to complement hotplug cpu, cpus usually come
   with memory).
The multi zone approach does not work with NUMA. NUMA only supports a 
single zone for memory policy control etc. Also multiple zones carry with 
it a management overhead that is unnecessary for the MOVABLE/UNMOVABLE
distinction.

I'd favor adding full defragmentation.
