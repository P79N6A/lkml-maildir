LSM can control mknod quite well.  And it is _all_ about security, don't
try to add "security" to some other portion of the kernel that it not
expecting it :)

Much like the API you already created to configure the permissions...

How can it be "faster"?  There is no speed problems here.
Please use LSM for this, that is what it is explicitly there for.

Ok then, use LSM to enforce those requirements, again, that is what it
is there for.

So the kernel's job is to enforce policy that an old userspace can not
seem to get straight?  That bit of logic doesn't go over so well...
Andrew, please drop these patches from your tree, this all should be
done with a simple LSM interface, which would be much smaller and much
less intrusive than this patchset.
