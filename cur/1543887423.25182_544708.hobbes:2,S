Both __pure and __attribute_pure__ are the same, and I found out that 
there is only a handful of users for these. __attribute_pure__ is 
used in approximately 15 places, and __pure is not used anywhere.
Is either __pure or __attribute_pure__ preferred? Imo, __pure looks 
much nicer than __attribute_pure__ so we could do a replacement.
