I have an old tropez card with CS4231.
First I tried MAD16 with Wavefront but it won't work:
-	 WaveFront: autodetected IRQ 15 not the value provided (9)
-	 WaveFront: hardware reset failed
-
-	 WaveFront: firmware download failed!!!
-	 WaveFront: initialization failed.
-	 /lib/modules/2.2.0/misc/wavefront.o: init_module: Device or resource busy
(Audio works)
Then I tried CS4232 with Wavefont
-	cs4232                  2428   0  (uninitialized)
And it didn't worked either.
(No auido/midi)
At last I tried MAD16 with Maui (this worked with the 2.0 series)
- insmod maui io=0x290 irq=9
- /lib/modules/2.2.0/misc/maui.o: unresolved symbol trace_init
(Auido works)
=> So which driver should I use???
