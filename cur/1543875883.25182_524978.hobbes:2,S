Maybe an rbtree would work better here?  Maximum number of nodes  
traversed to get to the bottom of the tree given 2^(20) loop devices  
is 19 as opposed to the 2^(20) for a linked list.  Also, to preserve  
compatibility with existing userspace loop tools you should probably  
always allocate one extra loop device.  Keep a "highest used loopdev"  
number and create the one after that so that udev will autocreate a  
dev node for it.
