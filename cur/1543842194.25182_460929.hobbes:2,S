  Actually I don't quite understand how it can happen what you describe
(so probably I missed something). How it can happen that some buffers
are unmapped while we are committing them?  journal_unmap_buffers()
checks whether we are not committing truncated buffers and if so, it
does not do anything to such buffers...
