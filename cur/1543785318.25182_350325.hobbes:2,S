OK, I've converted it to a plain "struct".
I think this code is just following PCMCIA style:
typedef struct pccard_mem_map { 
	u_char	map;
	u_char	flags;
	u_short	speed;
	u_long	static_start;
	u_int	card_start;
	struct resource *res;
} pccard_mem_map;
Any reason why this typedef and similar ones in ss.h 
are wanted? 
PCMCIA is also using u_xxx "weird data types" extensively.
