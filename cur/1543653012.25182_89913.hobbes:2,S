The former.  Just hack up a patch for x86 and alpha (skip dropping
init for now) and we can see what it looks like.  I can do ppc32, and
when I get back home, ppc64 and Itanium (which IMHO is the real test:
ia64 seems to have one of everything).
It will probably take a week, since I return to .au in two days, and
that always hurts.  Sorry 8(
Rusty.
