I fixed this bug and another in the soundblaster code a billion
years ago back in 2.0.35.  If I'm not mistaken, Alan either
accepted my patch or worked it into 2.0.36 manually.
There were two little problems.  The problem was that the code
that initializes the structs for midi did NOT initialize dma to
"-1" for midi - indicating that there is NO DMA for
midi.  Instead it left it uninitialized and it ends up being zero
instead, and the display code sees it as zero and then displays
DMA zero.
A bunch of people argued that it uses DMA 0, or that DMA 0 means
no DMA, however they were about as intelligent as a squashed
grape obviously.
I believe the file was sound.c or sb.c, however its been a
while.  In addition I found an irq initialization being done
twice in the code, which I cleaned up.
I can hunt it down and fix it again for 2.3.x if someone hasn't
allready.  It was a 2 liner for the DMA/midi prob, and one line
removed for the irq thing.. simple.
