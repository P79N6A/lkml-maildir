Hmm, so what is going to replace it?  I was messing about with my
old powerbook G4 titanium, trying to make wpa_supplicant work
when I realized the airport/orinoco driver used for my powerbook
can't handle WPA since that apparently requires at least WE-18.
I started looking into what it would take to teach the orinoco
driver about WE>=18.  But I suppose there is no point in my
looking further if WE is heading to the great bit-bucket in the
sky.
Is 'Wireless Extensions The Next Generation' described and
documented somewhere?  Or am I better off if I just give up and
move on to some other more realistic project?  :-)
