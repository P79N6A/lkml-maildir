I thought about this some more. If you watch for e.g. all writes on the 
root of a file system you get a complete, correctly ordered log of all 
file writes on that filesystem. So you can find out wether a certain 
file has been changed or not. That could be relevant security information.
You would get changes to the file pointed to by the path /etc/shadow, 
even if the file has been changed by a hard link from /tmp/bla.
I am assuming here that there is a way like inode numbers to uniquely 
identify and persistently identify a file. If something like this does 
not exist, you are out of luck.

You don't trace aliases in userland. All the relevant information is 
logged in kernel space. The only thing you do in userspace is to convert 
this information into a user readable form. You can take as long as you 
want for that.
Btw: why did you put aliases in quotes? Is aliases not the correct term 
when refering to multiple paths pointing to the same file?

There is an event for mounting and unmounting.

That is why the paths returned by the mechanism are relative to the 
directory from which you watch.

If you have 100 clients, and each client wants its own notification for 
/home, you would indeed have a problem. But if a single process like fam 
watches for changes in /home on behalf of all 100 clients, it would be 
no problem.

File managers are just one application of an enhanced file change 
notification mechanism. There are many much more interesting 
applications. For file managers the current dnotify mechanism is OK.
