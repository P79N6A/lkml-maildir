Locking isn't needed for access to the pml4?  This is a wee bit
different from pgd's and I didn't see any documentation about it
anywhere.  Could be confusing.

Is this just for debugging?

If someone attempts to clear an address which is in the top PGDIR_SIZE
bytes of memory, this will overflow.  Is that an issue?
There also seems to be quite a bit of churn in the copy_*_range()
functions that isn't completely related to the pml4 changes.  Should
that get broken out?
