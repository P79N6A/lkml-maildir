This was kind of triggered by the discussion on the 2.6 v 3.0 thread
about how many people are trying 2.5.x.
I've just tried cross building 2.5.39 for various architectures.  This
is from the standard 2.5.39 dist without any architecture specific
patches.
The crosses were done from Debian/sid with the toolchain-source package
having built the compiler/tool chains.
All builds were done with the form:
make CROSS_COMPILE=....-linux- ARCH=.... 
The results aren't pretty:
Alpha:
------
Configured for LX164; built the vmlinux and then hit:
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer tools/objstrip.c
-o tools/objstrip
