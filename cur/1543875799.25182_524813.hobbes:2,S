I am sorry to report that this did not change anything - I still get the
same timeouts on system boot during CD-ROM detection. To remind:
00:07.0 ISA bridge: ALi Corporation M1533/M1535 PCI to ISA Bridge [Aladdin
IV/V/V+]
scsi 0:0:0:0: Direct-Access     ATA      IC25N020ATDA04-0 DA3O PQ: 0 ANSI: 5
scsi 1:0:0:0: CD-ROM            TOSHIBA  DVD-ROM SD-C2502 1313 PQ: 0 ANSI: 5
BTW should not libata fail back to PIO if all DMA fails? It never does for
me; this is strange.
I am tempted to test ACPI driver if you have patch suitable for mainstream
(not -mm)
thank you
