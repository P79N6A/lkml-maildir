Ah, thanks, that clarifies.  Sorry for my misread.

AFAICT, all the time-critical smp_processor_id() things are basically
for indexing into a per-cpu data array.  Even things like module.h and
percpu_counter.h would benifit from replacing those huge
inside-structure [NR_CPUS] arrays with a dynamic allocation.

I'll try to find time today or early next week.
Thanks!
Rusty.
