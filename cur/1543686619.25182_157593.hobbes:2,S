I thought the KT400 chipset (at least) had been backported to 2.4.21 ?
I'm not experiancing any technical problems. The nvidia /proc interfaces are 
reporting that I'm running at agp 8x, and I have full hardware acceleration 
enough to play games like Unreal Tournament 2003 quite fast (~50fps), its 
just that agpgart cant find my aperature size...
I just tried my vendors (mandrake) 2.4.22 kernel and I get exactly the same 
output.
