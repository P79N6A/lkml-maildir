As discussed, I've made a version of this available as:
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/patches/sharpsl_pm_move-r0.patch
This:
* moves the common code into arm/common
* adds a sharpsl_pm.h header file (in asm/hardware)
* adds appropriate Kconfig entries for this
* removes all the "nasty" macros
* refactors temperature measurement slightly
* removes most of the led code. I have some led patches which apply
after the patch above to implement that differently
* combined the status and measurement code into a single machine
dependent function.
I know that the pxa_pm_prepare/enter/finish functions are going to be a
problem on collie but will await the rest of Pavel's findings before
trying to work out the best way to handle it.
I've asked the person working on tosa (SL-C6000) to investigate what
changes he needs to the code to enable tosa to work within this
framework as well.
