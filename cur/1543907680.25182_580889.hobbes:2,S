The original question (unless I'm missing something) was "why _the owner_
of a process is not enabled to lower its IO priority?" The owner of the
process certainly can send signal and ptrace it.

System (whatever that means) should not depend on random users' processes.

Certainly there are a scenarios when lowering priority (CPU or IO) have 
negative effect. "If it hurts -- then don't do it". However, it is not
kernels job to decide if the user is right. If the user asks to do
something "stupid" (run his process with idle IO priority, whipe out his
home directory, you name it) -- just do that (as long as the action is 
permitted by the security policy).
P.S.
