Appologies for the noise.
I have been receiving 3 copies of mailings that are sent to linux-kernel
and name me in the To: and CC: lines.  This mail is designed to put a
theory to the test.
 - this mail, when it leaves my system here only has linux-kernel
   as the envelope recipient.  I should only receive _one_ copy back,
   directly from linux-kernel.
Please do _NOT_ reply to this mail.
Thanks.
