Adrian,
I have added those hooks back into the driver, because they are needed 
for the cx88-ivtv ioctl emulation layer.  However, I have instructed 
Mauro not to merge that patch upstream -- it is meant to stay at our 
mercurial repository only, since the vanilla kernel does not need to use 
the cx88-ivtv ioctl emulation layer.
It looks like somehow these got into -mm ... I think that is because 
Andrew's scripts pull from Mauro's devel branch in his git tree.
The problem commit is:  de513acdbafc48c52017255fee02af727dcfcc32
It appears that Mauro has folded my patch into Steve's patch, which he 
should not have done.  :-(  What a mess!
I will send a new patch to Mauro later on today to be applied to his git 
devel branch, which will remove those hooks again.
As soon as ivtv gets merged into our tree, that's when we will be able 
to remove cx88-ivtv alltogether, as there will no longer be any need to 
support the ivtv API.
regards,
Mike Krufky
