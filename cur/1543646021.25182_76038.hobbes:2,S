That loop does set_capacity() on each element in rd_disks[], but
set_capacity(disk,size) just sets disk->capacity = size, and
initrd_disk is a different variable so I don't see how initrd_disk
could ever get a capacity assigned to it unless by an explicit
"set_capacity(&initrd_disk, rd_size * 2);".
