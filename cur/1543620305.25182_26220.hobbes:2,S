	I for sur agree. Especially if we consider the practical approach :
	Not all patches are required to add the file under linux/patches/, but good 
ones will
	Probability that such thing happen is almost 0, big kernel guys aren't even 
reading this thread :(. I won't loose my time trying ot make this happen as 
they wont even consider reading about such things.  too bad :(
