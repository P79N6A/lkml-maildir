I am using the 2.6.0 rpms from:
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/2.5/
Specifically its:
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/2.5/RPMS.kernel/kernel-smp-2.6.0-0.test11.1.99.i686.rpm
The  kernel-2.6.0-test11-i686-smp.config
says: 
# CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM is not set
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G is not set
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y
CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UMEM=m
CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM=y

Did you have HIGHMEM set?
