If you mean to test/exploit them, see
http://lxc.sourceforge.net/patches/2.6.20/2.6.20-lxc8/broken-out/tests/
Compile the ns_exec.c program and do
	ns_exec -m /bin/sh
to get a shell in a new mounts namespace.

Non-working?  I sure hope the one used for LSPP certification is
working...  As is the ugly version I wrote 18 mounts ago and use on my
laptop.

I'm not sure there's a that long a way to go, but clearly we need to be
showing users what they can do, or they'll never work their way towards
there.
For instance, as you say, a user admin gui with a checkmark and text
boxes saying 'enter new namespace on login', 'create private /tmp',
and 'create private dmcrypted /home' would be trivial right now.
