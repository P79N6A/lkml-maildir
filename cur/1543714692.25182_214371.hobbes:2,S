/proc/nfs/exports is a server-side thing, and just reflects the kernel's
cache of currently exported filesystems. It is controlled by mountd by
means of a syscall...
I don't see what you are getting at here. There is no such thing as a
reliable way of ensuring that the server has a fully uptodate list of
all clients that are currently mounting a filesystem: Clients can and do
crash. When they do, they will fail to send a "umount" call to the
server. When that happens, the reference count in /var/lib/nfs/rmtab
will be wrong, and so all these lists from /proc/fs/nfs/exports to
"showmount" will show clients that are no longer there.
Just don't rely on that information: it will never be completely
correct.
Cheers,
