I have a similar problem: (Kernel 2.3.99pre3, 256MB Ram)
(this bug report may be considered useless because the kernel is 
compiled with gcc 2.95.3 19991030 (prerelease) from gcc-2.95.2-4mdk)

As you can see, the write starts relatively fast (ca 4000 blocks per second,
this is not a very fast scsi disk, but ok). After 3 seconds the system
starts to swap out. Not much (I wrote only 100MB and I had 100MB of free
memory), but while doing the same with 500MB I saw swap usages of 100MB.
Then dd writes out it's "100+0 records in/100+0 records out" message, but
doesn't return. Instead the write rate goes down to 120 blocks per second,
and stays there for a very long time. The same happens if I do a "sync"
during a big write: The write speed drops to less than 10% of its normal
value. If I do nothing else, vmstat displays:

That is, 120 writes per second, and 100(timer)+120 interrupts per second.
So, the system seems to write only one block per interrupt, something is
wrong here, isn't it? After all, this was a sequential write directly to
the device. (The same happens if I write to regular file on the scsi disk).
Writing to ide is much better, but that may be caused by the fact that my
ide drive is much faster.
Without knowing the internals, I think linux is filling up it's whole 
memory with dirty buffers (and even starts to swap - this may get fatal
if the swap partition is on the same drive as the file written to) and
then has a problem writing the stuff back.
