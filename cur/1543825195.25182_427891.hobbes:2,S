That's unfortunately right.

I would not call them broken.
They simply don't have subvendor/subdevice informations, but when these
informations are requested, the card gives back zeroes.

I can confirm this for the dpc7146, the mxb and the hexium_orion.

Up to now, this problem did not show up so drastically. On the one hand,
just a few dozen people use the MXB, a handful use the hexium_orion and
the dpc7146 is really rare. All these users then simply tweaked their
environment so that it works for the next boot.
In order to fix this, these drivers should not be autoloaded because
there is no sane way to autodetect these cards. In theory, you could do
an i2c bus scan and check if all devices are there. But since MXB and
dpc7146 both use the saa7111 video decoder on address 0x11 IIRC, the
dpc7146 will grab any MXB device if loaded before.
Distributions probably should keep these drivers from being autoloaded.
