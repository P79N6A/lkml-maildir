Toshiba Satellite 4070CDT.  APM has worked without any problems, in
2.4 and earlier kernels, both Red Hat kernels and vanilla ones.
I'm not using X :)
I am using vesafb, as my text console.  Same with 2.4.
I've just noticed a notable change: the Toshiba SMM driver.  That is
now configured in, whereas before it was a module and I never loaded
it.  Although I don't use it, when it initialises it does some funky
SMM stuff - might that be breaking resume?
