Subject: Patch: linux-2.5.2-pre8/drivers/net/aironet4500_core.c tried to return NODEV, should be -ENODEV

	linux-2.5.2-pre8/drivers/net/aironet4500_core.c
contains contains a routine that tried to return NODEV as
an error code where the author's intention was apparently
-ENODEV.  That is the second error of this type that the
change in kdev_t has exposed (the other one was in
drivers/isdn/sc/command.c).
	Here is the patch.
