Because we haven't yet agreed upon any other security model.  For now,
although I know you really dislike it, the fact is that "the initial
namespace has special privileges" is our basic security model.
If you want to have a discussion about an appropriate security model,
or an infrastructure to support multiple models, I think this would be a
good time, given that several namespaces are out there.  And networkns,
making its way up, also has concerns.
Three basic approaches I could see being simple to both implement and
understand/use are
1. add a set of capabilities concerning cross-ns operations, not
reassignable once they are removed.  Simple to understand, very
limited.
2. maintain that any cross-ns operation is allowed if and only if
the target ns is a child of the subject ns.
3. cross-ns operations are not permitted.  The only way to achieve
them is using a (as-yet unimplemented, but i'm working on it) namespace
enter feature to execute code in a child namespace.

Yup.

Obviously CAP_KILL is insufficient :)  I assume you mean a new
CAP_XNS_CAP_KILL?

Ok, in this case actually I suspect you're right and we can just ditch
the exception.  But in general the security discussion is one we should
still have.
