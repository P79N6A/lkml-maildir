I use fedora core 4,when I reboot from linux(not from windows or
BIOS),it will hang after the system POST
This only happens in reboot from linux kernel within
2.6.10-2.6.13-rc4(not from BIOS or windows).when I use grub to handle
boot ,the grub will hang after the system POST,must reboot again from
BIOS to boot correct in the grub menu.
It only happened *reboot* from linux,if I directly cold boot
everything is ok,or if I reboot from windows it 's booted ok also
I tested the older kernel version from 2.6.13-rc4 to 2.6.8 .I found
the 2.6.8 and the 2.6.9 worked well without above
reboot_from_linux_with_hang_after_POST,and the 2.6.10-2.6.13-rc4 were
all have
I haven't subscribe to the LKML only for this one bug,just sendmail to me,please
