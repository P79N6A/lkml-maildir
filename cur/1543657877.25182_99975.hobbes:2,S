How about expanding the acronym IP to mean "intellectual patrimony" ?
This reflects on both sides of the copyright deal and the patent
system:
1) the work/invention was created by somebody, who should be
   compensated as an encouragement to share the work/invention
   with the rest of humankind
2) ultimately the work/invention belongs to all of mankind and
   not to the author/inventor ... after all, the work/invention
   is based on thousands of years of cultural and technical
   development, the vast majority of which is used without any
   restrictions or royalties (eg. the wheel)
3) future generations should be able to use the new intellectual
   patrimony without any restriction, just like we are able to
   use old intellectual patrimony without any restrictions
kind regards,
Rik
