First: vanilla IDE CDROM built into kernel, fs modules, except for ext2 of
course.
Pleasant bit of fun today. Mount CD-ROM, try to umount several times and get
"device busy", finally kill lingering WINE processes that were attached to the
directory, and umount, apparently fine. Then try to eject, get all sorts of
fun errors like this:
Mar 11 23:23:32 localhost kernel: VFS: busy inodes on changed media.
Mar 11 23:23:33 localhost kernel: ATAPI device hdc:
Mar 11 23:23:33 localhost kernel:   Error: Not ready -- (Sense key=0x02)
Mar 11 23:23:33 localhost kernel:   Medium removal prevented -- (asc=0x53,
ascq=
0x02)
Mar 11 23:23:33 localhost kernel:   The failed "Start Stop Unit" packet
command 
was: 
Mar 11 23:23:33 localhost kernel:   "1b 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 "
And this:
Mar 11 23:33:41 localhost kernel: hdc: cdrom_decode_status: status=0x51 {
DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
Mar 11 23:33:41 localhost kernel: hdc: cdrom_decode_status: error=0x30
Mar 11 23:33:41 localhost kernel: hdc: ATAPI reset complete
Mar 11 23:33:41 localhost kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc),
sector 64
Mar 11 23:33:41 localhost kernel: ATAPI device hdc:
Mar 11 23:33:41 localhost kernel:   Error: Unit attention -- (Sense key=0x06)
Mar 11 23:33:41 localhost kernel:   Power on, reset or bus device reset
occurred -- (asc=0x29, ascq=0x00)
Mar 11 23:33:41 localhost kernel: isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=16:00,
iso_blknum=16, block=32
isofs refuses to unload, etc. Eject button doesn't work, have to manually yank
tray out. Eventually pulling the plug out of the back of teh unit and sticking
it back in fixes the problem. Everything works fine now. That's hot-pluggable,
eh?
Failing hardware on my part, or an insidious plot by the kernel?
