Very similar experiences. Other usage patterns that swap prefetch can
cause improvements with:
- Idling VMware session with large memory. Since VMware (server) can use
  mixed swap/RAM, the prefetch allows it swap back into RAM without
  having to make the application active in the foreground.
- Firefox, OO Office, long from-source compilations, all of the normal.
- My largest RAM capacity machine is a Core 2 Duo Laptop with 2 GB of
  RAM. It still benefits from the prefetch after running long
  compilations or backups.
- Also, I have an old Pentium 4 server (1.3 GHz, original RDRAM, ...)
  that uses the CK patches including swap prefetch. It has only 640 MB
  of RAM, and runs GBytes of data backup every night. The swap is split
  among multiple disks, and can easily fill .5 GBytes over
  night. Applications that run in a VNC session, web browsers, office
  programs, etc., all resume much faster with the prefetch. Even the
  intial ssh-login appears snappier; but I think that is just CK's fine
  work elsewhere. :)
I am curious how much of the benefit is due to prefetch, or due to CK
using `vm_mapped' rather than `vm_swappiness'. Swappiness always seemed
such an unbenificial hack to me...
(The past 6 months I've tried weeks/months of using various kernels,
-mm, -ck, vanilla, genpatches, combinations there of -- x86 and ppc.)
I vote for prefetch and `vm_mapped'.
