Hi Linus, hi all,
A very simple patch against 2.6.0 follows, which fixes an improper file
reference in the scsi sym53c8xx_2 driver help text. The referenced
documentation file was moved in 2.5.48 but the help text was not updated
accordingly.
Please apply.
And thanks a lot for the excellent work :)
