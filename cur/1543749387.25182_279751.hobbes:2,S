  Today, I have a try using netcat. But I found that
the problem still exist!
  By accident, I found that this problem is related to
native IPsec that runs between my local machine and
the remote machine. 
  I'm using IPsec-Tools ( which including racoon,
setkey) as the user-space tools for the native IPsec
of linux kernel. Only if I run the command "setkey -f
/etc/ipsec.conf" on the remote machine, the syslogd
(or netcat) running on the remote machine will unable
to record the messages that have been reached the
remote machine. If I'm not run this command on remote
machine, the syslogd/netcat will be able to record the
arrived messages. (the /etc/ipsec.conf on the remote
machine is shown in the end.)
  Then, CAN'T netconsole be used in the IPsec
environment (with IPsec-Tools)? How can we solve this
problem?
  Thank you.
PS.  
  The /etc/ipsec.conf on the remote machine (Just an
example).(I'm using racoon to automatically setup the
Security Associations.)
#!/usr/setkey -f
# Configuration for 192.168.0.1 (the remote machine)
# Flush the SAD and SPD
flush;
spdflush;
# Security policies
spdadd 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2 any -P out ipsec
           esp/transport//require
           ah/transport//require;
spdadd 192.168.0.2 192.168.0.1 any -P in ipsec
           esp/transport//require
           ah/transport//require;
