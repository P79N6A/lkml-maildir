I like that solution. There is still a possible small issue
in 2.4 but I don't think we need to care about it (see below)
Note about the 2.4 SMP race I talked about, x86 is indeed safe,
as it also uses (jiffies - wall_jiffies) to adjust the offset,
I missed it at first as it's not done from the do_gettimeoffset()
function where I was looking for it.
However, that that means we may apply more than one jiffie to
xtime at once, thus the above workaround would still have a small
hole. But since that happens only with insane interrupt latencies
that I don't expect to see in real life, it's probably a non-issue.
2.6 should always have jiffies and wall_jiffies in perfect sync
as they are manipulated within the same write_lock block.
Ben.
