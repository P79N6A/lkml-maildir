Subject: [PATCH 1/9] readahead: simplify readahead call scheme
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

It is insane and error-prone to insist on the call sites to check for async
readahead after doing any sync one. I.e. whenever someone do a sync readahead:
				if (!page)
					page_cache_sync_readahead(...);
He must try async readahead, too:
				page = find_get_page(...);
				if (PageReadahead(page))
					page_cache_async_readahead(...);
The tricky point is that PG_readahead could be set by a sync readahead for the
_current_ newly faulted in page, and the readahead code simply expects one more
callback to handle it. If the caller fails to do so, it will miss the
PG_readahead bits and never able to start an async readahead.
Avoid it by piggy-backing the async part _inside_ the readahead code.
Now if an async readahead should be started immediately after a sync one,
the readahead logic itself will do it. So the following code becomes valid:
				if (!page)
					page_cache_sync_readahead(...);
				else if (PageReadahead(page))
					page_cache_async_readahead(...);
