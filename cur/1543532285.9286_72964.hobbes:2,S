AIUI [0], Al Viro, Stephen Tweedie, and a number of others have some
interesting plans for the block device layer, buffer cache and page cache,
and the interactions between them and with the VFS -- for 2.5. I assume
they're busy with tidying up 2.4pre loose ends at the moment, but hopefully
after 2.4 is out the door and stable there will be some discussion of the
planned changes on linux-fsdevel. It sounds (I've not looked at your code yet)
like your input would be useful when that happens. An I/O system that meets
everyone's needs for 2.6 would be a great goal..
BTW, regarding your comments about Linux documentation - have you looked at
the work Alan Cox is doing on this yet?
Cheers,
Steve
