If you say so.... However, I am not sure that you (we?) can actually
control it.

Well, I actually do think that this has happened with glibc-2.1.

So they took a snapshot of gcc that is known to be broken,
fixed it up a bit and released it as working code (from
http://www.redhat.com/products/software/linux/rhl7_new_features.html
):
 "GCC Compiler 2.96 GCC 2.96 allows for faster optimized code and more
 complete C++ support."
 
This is neither true nor honest - there is no gcc compiler 2.96 (gcc
is named gnu compiler colelction, btw!), and that their version is a
seriously hacked non standard gcc snapshot, still, is alraedy causing
quite a few bogus bug reports.
It already forced the gcc maintainers to bump the internal version from
2.96 to 2.97.

Yes. "Your product doesn't work? Our redhat libc works for your software -
download it here. no, the compatitors are not gnu/linux compatible". Great
future.
Anyway, my pont *here* is that the kernel shouldn't explicitly support
this marketing.
