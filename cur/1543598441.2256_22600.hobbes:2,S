The Sony PCG-N505VX has the same problem (swab_apm_power_in_minutes). 
Here is the pertinant information:
BIOS_VERSION W2K06H0
BIOS_DATE    02/03/00
I will have a patch up against 2.4.7 (Linus's)on the web at
http://www.sujal.net/tech/linux
 shortly.
Though I can't confirm it, I'm fairly sure that the PCG-N505VE has the
same bios, too.
