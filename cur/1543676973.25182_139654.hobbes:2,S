  This is hyper threading.  This is intel's attempt to cram extra 
instructions on each cpu cyle.  It may make things faster, or slower.  
It really depends on what you are doing.  You can shut off hyper 
threading off in the bios.

  Well if you are generally only running a single program then it will 
speed things up.  If you run a number of programs all at once it will 
speed things up.  Hyperthreading tends to be a good thing if you are 
running 8 or more cpu hungry processes.

  For the most part.  It also enables io-apic and other stuff.
