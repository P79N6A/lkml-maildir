Its because you're using a version of gcc which doesn't have
__builtin_expect (eg, egcs 1.1.2, some versions of gcc 2.95).
I'm told that gcc 2.95.[12] are not suitable for kernel compilation...
I've currently got the following in my tree (sorry, no diff since I've
got other changes in this file).  lib/rwsem.c, line 9, add:
#if __GNUC__ < 2 || (__GNUC__ == 2 && __GNUC_MINOR__ < 96)
#define __builtin_expect(exp,c) (exp)
#endif
I'm not sure if this is correct, or which compilers work, which don't
(so don't anyone go and drop it into Linus/Alans kernels), but it
seems to work for me.
