Yes, it's basically the same thing and yes, it could be done
this way.  The only difference is that withdraw_netdev()
will blurt out a warning if it is called on an unhidden device.
This is useful now, but less so later.   I guess it could be
#defined onto unregister_netdev later..

You are correct, and that is in fact how I did it in rrunner.c.
I'll do eepro100 and acenic that way too.  The manual is wrong :)
BTW: I just finished the ethernet devices, so my request for
help can be ignored.  Fixed a truckload of unchecked kmallocs
and error-path memory leaks while I was at it.  Sigh.
