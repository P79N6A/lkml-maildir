Patch for ketchup 0.9.6
=======================
From Michael Opdenacker <michael@free-electrons.com>
Issue
-----
> ketchup -l
2.4 (signed)
 old stable kernel series
2.4-pre (signed)
 old stable kernel series prereleases
2.6 (signed)
 current stable kernel series
2.6-bk (signed)
 old stable kernel series snapshots
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/soft/src/ketchup", line 686, in ?
    lprint(tree, ["(unsigned)","(signed)"][version_info[tree][3]])
TypeError: list indices must be integers
Explanation
-----------
For tree '2.6-ck', version_info[tree][3]=='.sig'
instead of '0' or '1'.
The below code only supported the '0' and '1' cases:
lprint(tree, ["(unsigned)","(signed)"][version_info[tree][3]])
