Hi all,
Thanks hemanshu. You are very nice
Could I copy the file /proc/ to harddisk? I hope I can directly write the
data to the harddisk as I am working on logging system. I am writing a
function performing like printk , but it directs the event messages to a
specific disk location e.g. /usr/log/sys.log.
Thanks
George
