Hi David,
I misspoke.  The potentially failing spin is in __down_write and
__down_read in lib/rwsem-spinlock.c, not in rwsem_down_failed_common.
The problem is is that 'flags' is on the callee's stack and is thus
subject to be optimized out of the loop if the compiler is smart enough
to discover that it is on the stack.  Apparently gcc is not yet smart
enough but that doesn't mean it won't be so soon.
