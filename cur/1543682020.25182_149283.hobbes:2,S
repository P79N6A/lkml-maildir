That sounds like a nice way to start.

I don't think it will be that bad for them.  Just have them change the
v4l device from being a structure included in their structure, into a
pointer, and then create it before registering, and free it in the
release() callback.
That being said, I haven't actually looked at the code to verify that
this is all that is needed :)

Breaking the build is a very good thing to do at times, to ensure that
stuff gets fixed properly.  Users might go for a while without realizing
that there really is a problem in their driver.
But in the end, it's up to you...
