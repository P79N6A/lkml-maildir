One of the key points of the implementation would have to be the ability
to delete old revisions without affecting the subsequent revisions. This
would allow people to keep the number of revisions down.
Also if each revision is in effect a patch on the last revision it could
cut down the disk space required to store them, or if that takes to long
to read a file then have every tenth version (0,10,20,30...not the tenth
versions I know but easier to read) as a full version of the file which
all future versions are changed off.

I hadn't considered that but I did think that you could remove the old
revisions of a file at some configurable time after. This would allow
recovery in case of accidental deletion but should keep the disk space
usage down.

Possibly but if I use it to manage my entire system (ie as a package
manager) then the system would likely explode if I tryed to update or
remove a key package whilst the system was running. With the kernel
involved then the process could be much smoother.
