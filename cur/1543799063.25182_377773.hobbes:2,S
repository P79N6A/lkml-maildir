Static analysis of this problem is possible.
"make checkstack" is a good starting point.
And the automatic analysis of all possible call chains can and has 
already found problems.

We are talking about reducing the stack size by one third which doesn't 
result in a fundamental difference.
There is no technical reason why 4 kB shouldn't be enough - I don't 
count sloppy coding as a reason for it since in such cases we better 
correct the code.
