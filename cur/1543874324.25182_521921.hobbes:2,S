Blows up with ia64 allmodconfig due to CONFIG_PM=y, CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND=n:
kernel/power/main.c:223: error: redefinition of 'software_suspend'
include/linux/suspend.h:46: error: previous definition of 'software_suspend' was here
I had a look at fixing it, but it's unobvious why we're compiling most of
kernel/power/main.c when CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND=n so I'll send this series
back for repair please.
