It is a question of size and provenance.  Alan Cox descriped the mpt
fusion update as "assorted small fixes" and deletions exceed additions
in the patch set by 40%.  It's also about user base:  aic7xxx is by far
the most widely used SCSI chip, I'm not sure how many 2.4 fusion users
there are but I speculate its probably orders of magnitude fewer.

The argument isn't about size, it's about safety.  No company that wants
to stay in business accepts code into release stabilisation unless it's
clearly justifiable.  Trying to buck the system by including five
features plus one critical bug fix is one of the oldest tricks in the
Software Engineers book---do this and you get hauled before the release
committee whose job will be to pare the addition back to just the bug
fix (and send you away with a flea in your ear to boot).

Marcelo reacted exactly as the release committee would at Adaptec:
either provide the bug fix for assessment or we'll push it out into the
next release.  This is industry standard practice, so I don't see any
problem.

I agree.  One of the necessary things for a fast release is a good
release manager (and thus one prepared to make unpopular decisions--and
ones you don't necessarily agree with).
