While your code is faster, it does not do exactly the same.
Original code completely pads the destination with zeroes,
while yours only adds the last zero. Your code does what
strncpy() is said to do, but maybe there's a particular
reason for it to behave differently in the kernel (helping
during debugging, or filling specific structs).
Just out of curiosity, have you tried to do a general
benchmark to check if original code eats much CPU ?
