I seem to recall looking at this option a while back, but didn't go that 
route since struct spu_context is opaque to me.  With such a teqnique, I 
could then use a simple 16-element array of  pointers to cached_info 
objects, creating them as needed when spu_context->profile_private is 
NULL.  I suppose the better option for now is to add a 
get_profile_private() function to SPUFs, rather than requiring 
spu_context to be visible.  Don't know why I didn't think to do that 
before.  Ah, well, live and learn.
