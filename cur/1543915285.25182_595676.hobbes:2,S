No we don't. All workloads benefit from larger block sizes when
you've got a btree tracking 20 million inodes and a create has to
search that tree for a free inode.  The tree gets much wider and
hence we take fewer disk seeks to traverse the tree. Same for large
directories, btree's tracking free space, etc - everything goes
faster with a larger filesystem block size because we spent less
time doing metadata I/O.
And the other advantage is that sequential I/O speeds also tend to
increase with larger block sizes. e.g. XFS on an Altix (16k pages)
using 16k block size is about 20-25% faster on writes than 4k block
size. See the graphs at the top of page 12:

The benefits are really about scalability and with terabyte sized
disks on the market.....
Cheers,
Dave.
