set_page_dirty queues pages for IO, and the writeout daemon will service
that queue when it sees fit. IMO it is sufficient that you cannot say the
implementation does not meet the standard.

But if you didn't notice until now, then the current implementation
must be pretty reasonable for you use as well.
