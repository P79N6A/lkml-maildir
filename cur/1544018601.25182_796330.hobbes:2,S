Correct. But this is only an issue if you think about policies applying to
individual object allocations (like realized in SLAB). If policies only
apply to pages (which is sufficient for balancing IMHO) then this is okay.

Memory policies are applied in a fuzzy way anyways. A context switch can
result in page allocation action that changes the expected interleave
pattern. Page populations in an address space depend on the task policy.
So the exact policy applied to a page depends on the task. This isnt an
exact thing.

Well but you said that you would defer the trimming (due to latency
concerns). The longer you defer the larger the lists will get.
