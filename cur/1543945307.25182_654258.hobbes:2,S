Yes?
/ (double case - initramfs or kernel), sysfs, devpts and
hugetlbfs can be mounted using mount(8) (or mount(2)), so
userspace can - and distro scripts do just that - mount them.
futexfs, pipefs, anon_inodefs, bdev and inotifyfs are 'invisible'
filesystems in that you cannot mount them yourself and that you
do not usually get to see them except probably when readlink(2)ing
on /proc/X/fd/N.
