recently purchased the following mobo and have been trying multiple combinations of kernels/patches to try and get this working correctly. currently having to use a redhat 2.4.20-2.2.rpm to get the box to boot correctly yet it lacks xfs support. i'm needing to know if anyone has been able to get this combination of devices working correctly. if you need more info please reply directly as well as cc.. thanks
