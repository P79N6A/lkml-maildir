Why are we not going to assume coherence?  What NUMA platforms do we intend
to support in the relevant future that are not CC-NUMA?  AFAIK, the only NUMA
platforms we support so far are the SGI Origin 2X00 series (CC-NUMA) and the
Compaq AlphaServer GS* series (also CC-NUMA).
I just don't want generic code to have to pay too heavy a price for future
support of a platform we never support.  And truth be told, at that point
we'd be better off just running with Larry's idea of multiple
semi-independent operating systems and handling the lack of cache coherence
in a sane and well-defined way.
