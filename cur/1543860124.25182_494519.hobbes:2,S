 The level of security is always your choice. The real security is
 pretty expensive and you have to invest your time to make your system
 really safe. IMHO people who provides simple and cheap solutions are
 liars or marketing-agents or both.
 For example for my laptop is it true that "life is too short to
 enable SELinux", but it's probably not true for servers in the bank where
 I have money. (I hope so:-)

 There is possible customization of the existing selinux policy. You
 can generate a new loadable policy module from system audit logs (see
 audit2allow util). In the other words -- your system in the permissive
 mode is monitoring your 3rd party software and from the logs you can
 generate new selinux rules. And when you switch system to the
 enforcing mode the application should be run as expected with your
 new rules.
