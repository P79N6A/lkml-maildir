It strikes me that splitting one list into two lists will not provide
sufficient improvement in search efficiency to do that.  I mean, a naive
guess would be that it will, on average, halve the amount of work which
needs to be done.
But we need multiple-orders-of-magnitude improvements to address the
pathological worst-cases which you're looking at there.  Where is this
coming from?
Or is the problem which you're seeing due to scanning of mapped pages
at low "distress" levels?
Would be interested in seeing more details on all of this, please.
