In hope to kill this thread. The best way to filter email is to use 
this line, it should be the very first line in the header (Note:
I mean "^From " not "^From: ").
From owner-linux-kernel-outgoing@vger.rutgers.edu
It is a foolproof way to identify email even if someone bcc the email
from LKML as it is appeneded by sendmail on vger (I belive).
If your email dones not have this line, you are pretty much screwed.
