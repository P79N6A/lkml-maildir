It is better than default data=ordered I think :)
Thanks for detailed explanation - it saved much time for me and
accortind to yours directions I have recalculated my test. Now ext3 is
better :)

this is two typical runs. Now I creating ext3 with
mke2fs -j -O dir_index -J size=192 -T news /dev/sda4
as you can see, this improves performance by 1/4
Unfortunately, there still one issue in ext3. It called "inode limit".
Initially I wanted to run this test on 1000000 files but ... I hit
inode limit and don't want to increase it artificially yet.
Reiserfs worked fine because it don't have such kind of limit ...
