This is the user-visible change, and I don't really understand why do we
need it.
Imho, this patch can confuse the user-space. Why should we report that,
say, SIGCONT is ignored by the global init?
Even if I am wrong, I believe this change is orthogonal to rhis series,
and should be posted separately.
