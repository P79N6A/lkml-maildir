But it's broken.  In the non-debug case we subtract RW_LOCK_BIAS so we know
that the writer will get the lock when all readers vacate.  But in the
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK case we don't do that, with the result that taking a
write_lock can take over a second.
A much, much better fix (which involves visiting all architectures) would
be to subtract RW_LOCK_BIAS and _then_ wait for a second.
OK, it's only debug code.  But RH (for one) have decided to ship zillions
of kernels with this debug code turned on.
