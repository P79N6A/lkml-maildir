I experienced the freeze today again, but this time after
shutdown of ... Windows NT :-( I didn't interact with
the machine during POST or LILO, so I have no idea whether
it was already frozen there, but this time the reason
probably wasn't Linux.
The log (2.2.2ac-5) shows:
Mar  7 14:38:11 trillian kernel: PIIX3: not 100ative mode: will probe irqs later
Mar  7 14:38:11 trillian kernel:     ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
Mar  7 14:38:11 trillian kernel:     ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
Mar  7 14:38:11 trillian kernel: Keyboard timeout[2]
Mar  7 14:38:11 trillian kernel: Keyboard timeout[2]
Mar  7 14:38:11 trillian kernel: hda: IBM-DHEA-34330, ATA DISK drive
Mar  7 14:38:11 trillian kernel: hdc: WDC AC2850F, ATA DISK drive
So in my case the s**t happens somewhere between
the BIOS starts and this point (send_data).
As I have seen the keyboard blocked also during
a POST at least in two cases, I start to suspect
BIOS / hardware problem here.
I have flashed the BIOS last year, but I have no
idea whether the occasional problems started
at the same time.

I use plain old A4tech serial mouse that is working
for me for 6 years ...
