I have the problem as well since I moved from my K6-II to an Opteron based
system. As a workaround, I only use the card in grab mode instead of
overlay, this reduces the frequency of the crashes from once per 30 minutes
to once per month.
Someone also suggested the problem might be related to the old bt848
(ca. 1997) chip not behaving well on modern PCI buses.
