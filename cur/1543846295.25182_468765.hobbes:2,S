I totally agree with Jeff.  The ISDN layer is effectively unmaintained
and the vast majority of the ISDN work that does actually occur is
done out-of-tree.
If someone cares enough about the ISDN layer, they can make changes
after Jeff's goes in to reduce the protection to a per-driver basis.
But right now, blocking this whole unmaintained pile of poo on 64-bit
is the best starting point.
We're talking about effectively an 8 year old code base that hasn't
been touched much at all during that time.  Let's be honest about the
situation.  The only subsystem that is more unmaintained and gathering
dust is probably the ftape layer :-)
