Hi
After many hours to testing, we found that the Hardware Watchdog Timer
module causes our motherboard's BIOS CPU fan control to stop
controlling the fan. On Linux bootup, the fan speed stays constant all
the time.
Setup:
- kernel 2.6.20.1 and 2.6.21.5
- iTCO_wdt loaded with ICH4 chip on motherboard
If watchdog module is excluded from the kernel build, fan control
works as normal.
Regards
Keith
