Hasn't it been said (by people in control) that binary only modules are
okay to link into the kernel, or do I remember incorrectly?  How is this
different from a binary only module?  Release an open-source component
under a BSD license, or even a commercial license if you like, along
with a closed source component.  Link the two together, and finally
insmod your non-GPL amalgamation into the kernel.
Anyway, you're not distributing your kernel with your module linked in,
so you're not distributing a derivative of a GPLed program, so by my
understanding section 2b doesn't apply.  Comments?
