There is a point to be made though that if *Linus* has to do a complicated 
merge, the 'patch' that caused the merge should probably be suspect in the 
first place.
The person sending the patch should be the one responsible for resolving a
complicated merge. If BK makes that easier, great. HOWEVER, I don't really
want Linus to be using some tool that does automerging.. No SCM system and
automerge tool is going to understand what the code *means*, unless it's 
got a compiler integrated into it.
I've had some strange things happen on a BK automerge in the past, and I
don't trust any automated system that doesn't understand the code to not
make some subtle semantic mistake. (Mind you, when strange things
happened, the code usually worked, and I didn't notice until I tried to
*manually* prepare a 'patch' to send upstream)
