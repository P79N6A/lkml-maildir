Guys,
I tried to compile 2.2.3-ac2, but for some reason its not creating
bzImage. Has anyone encountered this? I have uniprocessor machine and
linux-2.2.3-ac1 was working fine. You don't think that it is because I
didn't apply SMP diff file, do you? It is suppose to work even without
it because as I said I have uniprocessor machine. Any feedback is
welcome. Thanks to all again.
Alex
