Once again, please do not do this.  As some others already have pointed
out already, many (of not most) projects out there that builds against
the running kernel use '/lib/modules/$(uname-r)/build' to locate the
SOURCE, and will be broken.  Rather use an 'output' or some such symlink
to store the object files, but keep the meaning of 'build' intact.
If, then please treat it like any other stable interface, and depreciate
it in 2.7, and change (but better, remove it, so that there will be no
misunderstanding) in 2.8.
Thanks,
