That's for sure:
[me@nb linux-2.6.9]$ find . -name "*.[ch]" | xargs egrep -H -n '^[[:space:]]+if\(' | \

And my favorite pet peeve:
[me@nb linux-2.6.9]$ find . -name "*.[ch]" | \
> xargs egrep -H -n '^[[:space:]]+return[[:space:]]*\([^)]+\);' | \

There are a lot more than that but I could find no obvious way of including
"return(parenthesized expr)" while excluding "return (typecast)(expr)".
