Unless I'm mistaken this is a external patch i.e. not in mainline?
I do know of the work, but people willing to patch the kernel
should hopefully equally be able to cope with an rtai or rtlinux
patch.  If this is integrated into mainline I'll definately
check it out.

I posted a similiar question there but received no response.  From
what I can tell it is a frame work for providing hardware specific
timer sources to the kernel and also exporting posix userspace
system calls from the kernel.  It may do more in kernel but haven't
found exactly what it does, relevent docs?  Also is this in mainline
(or soon to be) or just patches against it?
Thankyou for your response.
Simon
