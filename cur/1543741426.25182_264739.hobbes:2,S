when I wrote that code in 2.4 it was called class_idx. Just to show it
was not an opaque type, in this 2.6 I called it classzone_idx but it's
the same as class_idx. If you feel classzone_idx is too long I'm sure
fine to rename to class_idx like plain 2.4.
The reason I renamed it is that alloc_type tells nothing to who's
reading the code. That value in the opaque "alloc_type" variable, is
really the classzone_idx that identify the classzone we have to allocate
memory from. Classzone 2 means "all ram is good", classzone 2 means
"zone-normal + zone-dma is good", classzone 0 means "zone-dma is good".
alloc_type means very very little to me, calling it with a meaningful
name made the code more readable for me. gfp_mask describes other alloc
types as well that are not less singificant than the classzone_idx, so I
don't see why we should go back to the opaque variable name when we can
have a more descriptive one.
I'm not going to nitpick further on this detail though, all I care about
is the asm generated and not breaking ABIs with userspace (i.e. at least
one forced rename to the sysctl).
thanks for the review!
