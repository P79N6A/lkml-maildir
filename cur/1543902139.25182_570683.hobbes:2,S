If you css_put() the last reference on a subsystem state object and
the associated container is marked as notify_on_release, then
check_for_release() is called which does a more full check of whether
the container is releasable. If it is, a workqueue task is scheduled
to run the userspace release agent, which can then do anything it
wants, including potentially deleting the empty container.
