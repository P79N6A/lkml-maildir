OK so I must have a broken kernel tree then. The lines you mention in
my version belong to vfs_sendfile function which indeed ensures ppos
is a valid pointer but do_sendfile is called from sys_sendfile(64).
I'll find the patch that did the change (some must have, obviously)
and report it there (probably linux-vserver is to blame)
This section of the file in vanilla 2.6.13.4 looks nothing like in my
file and the 2.6.13.3 and 2.6.13.4 patches have no changes there so at
least that's cleared up.
