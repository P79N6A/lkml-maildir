Hmm..
 your <linux/cred.h> file exposes "struct ucred" to user space (or at
least has a #ifdef __KERNEL__ that does not protect it). Why?
Also, I don't see how this is going to solve the credential clone problem,
which basically says that sometimes you do _not_ want to do COW on the
credentials (when changing them when they are shared with other threads)  
and sometimes you do (when changing them when they are shared with a
background filesystem lookup).
Any ideas on that?
(And I _really_ don't like those trivial inline functions in [1/3] - I
think it's much better to just show that we're doing a pointer dereference
than trying to hide it behind some silly "current_fsuid()" inline
function).
