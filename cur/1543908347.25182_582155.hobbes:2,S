Updating the manual page mount(8) with an expanded description of atime/noatime and adding nodirtime and data=<option> seems much more reasonable than hacking the kernel because you want others to run their systems the way you think they should.
Almost every web search of "linux fast disk" (or related words) references noatime, and many ext3 specific documents explain the caching options.
