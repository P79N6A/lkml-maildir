Oh, it is?  Clearly I am not well versed in the BKL... that's probably a 
good thing.... :)
Ok, let me look into it further.  I changed lock_kernel to 
udf_lock_kernel to complain & backtrace if we re-lock, and it always 
immediately hung after that; I assumed that was it.  I'll investigate 
further.
