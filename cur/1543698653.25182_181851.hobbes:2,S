	There you go, *ONCE* *LOADED* it becomes an integral part. So it's the
*use* of it that makes it integral. Disitribution is prior to use.

	Except the kernel function calls are not copyrighted, only their
implementation is. If you really meant what you're saying, any program that
used 'malloc' would be a derived work of any implementation of 'malloc'.

	So long as it must be mixed with the original work (and isn't already),
it's not clear that it's a derived work as it sits. Again, otherwise any
program that used 'malloc' would be a derived work of any implementation of
'malloc'.
