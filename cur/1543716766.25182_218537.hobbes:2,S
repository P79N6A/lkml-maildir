Well, I was thinking of simply adding the above in brackets on the same
or the next line.

I'm avoiding calling it swsusp2 because 'swsusp' is unpronouncable. It
also gets different interpretations: suspend2 isn't 'swap suspend'
because it's not inherently limited to saving to swap. 'software
suspend' is too long and doesn't seem to occur as quickly. Thus I'm
simply using suspend2.
