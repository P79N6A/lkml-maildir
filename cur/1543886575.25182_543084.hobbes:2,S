It's dangerous, all right (which is why it doesn't do it by default),
since you have no guarantee that the BIOS doesn't totally vomit on these
calls -- or, like my laptop, take about a minute before giving up
finding nothing.
Anyway, I re-implemented scanning and pushed it out to the git tree;
please try it out as it does absolutely nothing on any of my machines.

Once CR0.PE is set, segments are loaded from the GDT.
