Hi,
  I relatively new to the kernel and am trying to understand how the linux 
kernel handles interrupts. For this I attempted to
create an int 0x40 by adding a set_system_gate(64, &system_call) in traps.c. 
I verfied by giving out print statements within set_system_gate that 64 is 
being set during initialization (though it isnt a surprise that it is being 
set).  But when i give an int 0x40 in a user level assembly program I get 
segmentation fault, (a SIGSEGV signal is sent to the process).  I have tried 
adding another function in entry.S called my_system_call and reproducing the 
code in system_call with a jmp ret_from_sys_call  at the end. Also tried 
giving an empty C function for my_system_call all with the same result.
My assembly prints out hello world, from the linux assembly how to, 
reproduced here
If i replace int 0x80 with my int 0x40 I end up with a segmentation fault. 
Is there any thing other than set_system_gate and writing the my_system_call 
handler, that i need to do to have a successful int 0x40? I had tried
   a) commenting out just the deference of the system handler function 
within system_call (call *sys_call_table(0, %eax, 4) )
   b) using &system_call itself in set_system_gate
  but still the same situation.
Any suggestions will be appreciated.
Thanks
Raman
