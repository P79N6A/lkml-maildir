Hmm... this is even stranger. CMD25 (write) will only read from main
memory and should not be able to mess up the stack. And it shouldn't be
the stack getting messed up anyway as that is not near the buffer
memory.
I still consider this a critical bug since it seems to be provoked by
hitting the timeout condition.
I'll queue up your patches (once the other things are fixed), but I
will add a patch disabling DMA on this controller until this is
properly understood and handled.
