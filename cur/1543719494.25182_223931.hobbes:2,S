Hello,
I was wondering why is there no Linux NTFS-driver which allows full 
writing etc? Is there something that makes this particular difficult to 
implement? I mean Linux supports so many file systems, why has proper 
NTFS support been neglected?
Is there any file system I can use which satisfies these criteria:
A) works in both Linux and Windows
B) handle >4GB files
C) handle 120GB partitions
Sincerly,
/m
