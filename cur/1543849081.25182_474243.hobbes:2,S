I seem to recollect having this very discussion before and
we had agreed that backing up a cpu_exclusive cpuset with a 
sched domain was an optimization rather than overloading the 
cpu_exclusive flag and I dont think it has changed since then.

Sorry I dont understand this at all. Particularly marking 
an active job as a sched domain (I am yet to read all of the
mails in this thread, so please bear with me if you have
answered this elsewhere)
The only additional thing that happens once a cpuset has a 
sched domain associated with it would that the rebalance code
running on cpus not part of this cpuset would now not pull
tasks from the exclusive cpuset. How is that bad in any way ??

IMO this change is counter intuitive and pointless
