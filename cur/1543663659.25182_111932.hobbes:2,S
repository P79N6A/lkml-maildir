I believe you're right, but it's less obvious to me that the
other uses really want fixing e.g. would we be happy to maintain
utime,stime,cutime,cstime as 64-bit on a 32-bit machine?

Yes, it's much more important to fix those where userspace habitually
takes the difference.  That certainly applies to the return value from
sys_times, but I don't see any other cases as clear (though userspace
may have good reason to take the difference of any of them).
Perhaps a procps expert can advise?
