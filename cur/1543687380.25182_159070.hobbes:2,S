I would accept a patch that did something like
the following in arp_solicit().
	if (skb && inet_addr_type(skb->nh.iph->saddr) == RTN_LOCAL &&
	    (in_dev->conf.shared_media ||
	     inet_addr_onlink(dev, skb->nh.iph->saddr, 0)))
		saddr = skb->nh.iph->saddr;
	else
		saddr = inet_select_addr(dev, target, RT_SCOPE_LINE);
Then people can frob the shared_media sysctl for devices
where they want the behavior to be that we will only use
addresses assigned to the device as the solicitor address.
The shared_media setting defaults to one and thus would preserve
current behavior by default.
The idea is not mine, Alexey suggested it to me the other day.
I hope this pleases people wrt. ARP request solicitor address
handling.
