Yes that's the tradeoff. I just feel that the former may be better,
especially because the latter can be timing dependant (so you may get
things randomly "happening"), and the former is apparently very low
overhead compared with the cost of taking the lock. Any numbers,
anyone?

Off the top of my head, this is what it looks like:
spin_lock(&dst->lock);
spin_lock(&src->lock);
for (lots of stuff) {
	if (need_lock_break(src->lock) || need_lock_break(dst->lock))
		break;
}
spin_unlock(&src->lock);
cond_resched_lock(&dst->lock);
Right? Now currently the src->lock is broken, but your change would break
the cond_resched_lock here, it will not trigger because need_lock_break
clears dst->lock... oh I see, the spinning CPU will set it again. Yuck :(
