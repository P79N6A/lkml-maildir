Greetings;
I've just come across another bit of 2.6 trivia.
When browsing the web using mozilla-1.5a on a 2.6.0-test3-mm2 boot,  I 
find that using the back button takes you back to the top of the 
previous page.
So I rebooted to 2.4.22-rc2, and now the back button takes you back to 
the point of departure on the previous page.
Thats the best description I can give, and of course I have NDI what 
might be causeing it, but it is a bit startling.
This should work as expected before a real 2.6.0 is allowed out to 
play.
