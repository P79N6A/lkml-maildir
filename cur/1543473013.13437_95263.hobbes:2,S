	Are you by change using SLIP, and/or somehow managed to
	1) cause mismatch of your network link MTU values, 2)
	somewhere along the path ICMP messages have been filtered out ?
	By forcing your link to use MTU value of 572 MIGHT help with
	SMTP sending.  (As root:  ifconfig XXXXn mtu 572)
	Equally possibly it could then cause incoming datastreams
	(like FTP transfers, POP/IMAP accesses) to effectively hang.
	Check your network parameters.
