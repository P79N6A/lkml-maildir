it is not always good idea to fix the tools everytime new functionality 
is involved. why do you think there are no more tools except for 
ps,top,kill? will you fix it all?
Another example, when you have problems in your VPS it is very 
convinient to attach with strace/gdb/etc from the host. Will you patch 
it as well?
OpenVZ big advantage is this ease of administering compared to VM 
approach and it is not good idea to forbid this. If you have broken VM 
you have problems, in OpenVZ you have control over VPSs.

in OpenVZ we have VPSs fully isolated between each other.
But host system has access to some of VPS resources such as files, 
processes, etc. I understand your concern which is related to 
checkpointing, yeah?
