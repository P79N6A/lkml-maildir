Some results on my 5-year-old dual AMD2400+ with 1GB mem:

...a nice order of magnitude better! Very happy you fixed this Con.
But the time to touch was so different (11674 vs 6333ms) that I
decided to get out of X, and also check the difference when SP is off.

Have I understood correctly that there are more prefetch improvements
in ck2 than just the sp38 patch?
I'll post more results if I ever manage to tear myself from the
computer for 10 minutes when I'm home - it looks like I have a yiff
daemon running at 7% cpu all the time which might have affected the
results.
Speaking of "feel", the net effect of swap prefetch for me seems to be
that I don't notice it - that is, I don't notice my programs behaving
sluggishly when I come back to the computer. Excellent!
