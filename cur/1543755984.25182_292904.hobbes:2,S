Look at the scitech source code. There are a limited number of system
BIOS calls that need to be implemented. It is a fairly small number.
wakeup.S could supply implementations for these and patch them into
the right interrupt vectors while the VBIOS is being run. There is no
requirement that VBIOS run the actual system BIOS, it only has to
think that it is running on the system BIOS. This is the same scheme
used for running the ROMs in user space.
