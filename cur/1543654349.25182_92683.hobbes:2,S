Thanks, but I was hoping for a less radical solution:  just fixing
the "no device table support" bug fixed in the latest modutils ... I
do like the idea of forward motion in the module support, except that's
not what we've seen so far with modutils.
Seems like one of the issues is that there's really no maintainer
for modutils lately.  And I'm not even sure where to get the latest
modutils (more recent than 0.7) even if I were ready to patch them.
