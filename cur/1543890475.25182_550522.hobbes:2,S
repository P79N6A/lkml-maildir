+		        Using the Conditional Calls
+
+			    Mathieu Desnoyers
+
+
+This document introduces Conditional Calls and their use.
+
+* Purpose of conditional calls
+
+A conditional call is used to compile into the kernel a function call that is
+disabled at compile-time. Then, at runtime, it can be enabled dynamically. As
+explained below, the opposite can also be done.
+
+
+* Usage
+
+In order to use the macro cond_call, you should include linux/condcall.h.
+
+#include <linux/condcall.h>
+
+Add, in your code :
+
+ret = cond_call(examplecondcall, myfunc(a, b));
+
+Where :
+- examplecondcall is the conditional call identifier
+- myfunc(a, b) is a call to myfunc with valid parameters.
+- "ret" is, optionally, the variable in which the return value of myfunc() must
+  be put. If the conditional call is disabled, ret will be set to 0 casted to
+  the type of the return value of myfunc().
+
+Use cond_call_arm("examplecondcall") to activate the conditional call.
+
+Use cond_call_disarm("examplecondcall") to deactivate the conditional call.
+
+Use cond_call_query("examplecondcall") to query the conditional call state.
+
+The cond_call mechanism supports inserting multiple instances of the same
+cond_call. Conditional calls can be put in inline functions, inlined static
+functions, and unrolled loops.
+
+
+* Optimization for a given architecture
+
+One can implement optimized conditional calls for a given architecture by
+replacing asm-$ARCH/condcall.h.
+
+The CF_* flags can be used to control the type of conditional call. See the
+include/linux/condcall.h header for the list of flags. They can be specified as
+the first parameter of the _cond_call() macro, as in the following example,
+which declares a cond_call enabled statically (which can be disabled/reenabled
+dynamically)
+
+ret = _cond_call(CF_DEFAULT | CF_STATIC_ENABLE, examplecondcall, myfunc(a, b));
+
+Another example of flag usage is to declare a cond_call that always uses the
+generic version of the cond_calls. It can be useful to use this when cond_calls
+are placed in kernel code presenting particular reentrancy challenges.
+
+ret = _cond_call(CF_DEFAULT & ~CF_OPTIMIZED, examplecondcall, myfunc(a, b));
