Try dumping *all* MCE values, as well as a call stack.  Even although
MCE is tagged as processor context corrupt, there is rather big chance
that stack trace will point back to the instruction which caused MCE
(it always did in my case),  especially if it is single processor system.
Then you'll at least know which subsystem/driver did that.
