Yes, I saw this benchmark when it was first posted.  It isn't clear
from the web pages that you are using data=journal for ext3.  Note
that this is only a benefit for sync I/O workloads like mail and
NFS, but not other types of usage.  Also, for sync I/O workloads
you can get a big boost by using an external journal device.
Cheers, Andreas
