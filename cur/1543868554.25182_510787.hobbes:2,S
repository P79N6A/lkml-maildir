And we don't, that's why we have that "nobody cared" logic that disables 
the interrupt line if no driver services the interrupt. That doesn't 
provide a clean recovery, of course, it's meant to notify the user of 
what happened so that the problem can be fixed.

Exactly, for devices compiled into the kernel. In most setups this is 
only a fraction of all devices, so solving this problem only for drivers 
built into the kernel is no solution.

It's not coincidental, it is the only sane way to design hardware. You 
just can't go firing off interrupts without a driver having 
intentionally enabled them. There are a few devices that have had such 
issues, but they have been few and far between, certainly not enough to 
warrant the complexity of the scheme you propose.
