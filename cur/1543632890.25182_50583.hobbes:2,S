I think a per-disk laptop mode is reasonable... one might have virtual 
ATA devices like this 128MB flash chip I have (you plug it right into an 
ATA socket, no cables needed.   But I also agree that's a limited set of 
cases, and the additional complexity may not be worth it.
I've also thought in the past of having a "machine_policy" global 
variable, which could indicate to random userspace and kernel code a 
"laptop mode" or "file server mode" or "database server mode" etc.
