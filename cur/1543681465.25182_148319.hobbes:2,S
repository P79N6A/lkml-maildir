Yes you can. However, most developers on PPC4xx are interested in
eventual deployment.  Kernel math emulation is slow relative to
a soft float enabled userland so using something like ELDK or MVL
with PPC4xx/8xx makes a lot more sense.  If you want to leverage
binaries from Yellowdog/Debian/foo that are compiled for a classic
PPC processor rather than natively then you'll need to enable math
emulation.
