Just to make sure everyone agrees on this - there's currently a know bug 
in dc395x with highmem reported by Pierre Ossman in thread "Kernel panic 
with dc395x in 2.6.12.2" on linux-scsi. It is also trivial to reproduce on 
non-highmem machines. It was there also in 2.6.12. It only was hit by one 
person because not many use dc395x controlled cards in highmem machines 
today. The fix is known - at least revert my patch to dc395x commited to 
2.6.12-rc5. This will fix this bug, leaving another one, which is much 
harder to hit. There was only one person who hit it, but he cannot test 
any more patches - the hardware is not there any more. I think I have a 
fix for that one too, but that's another story. So, I would say it would 
be worth it reverting that patch before 2.6.13, but, that's because I feel 
personal responsibility for that bug:-)
Thanks
