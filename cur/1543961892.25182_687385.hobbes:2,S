yes and no. It can be fixed in Kconfig but i'm not going to flame yet 
another person about long-existing unfixed infrastructure bugs ;-)
The current (many years old) rule is to fix things up as much as we can 
and never expose build errors, because 1) randconfig testing is way too 
useful and because 2) users can stumble across that .config combination 
as well and get rightfully grumpy at us about breaking their build. Most 
of the thousands of drivers are fine - it's those with more complex 
Kconfig dependencies that have trouble.
