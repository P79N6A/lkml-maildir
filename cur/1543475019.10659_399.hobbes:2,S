World accessible with multiple connections is totally correct.
Only an exact authority match is acceptable. If you run a setuid
app and want to catch crashes, you need a setuid daemon to do it.
Possible exception: root (well, CAP_DEBUG_ANY) could ask to accept
anything left over. Users always get first chance.

Ugh. You get an authorization mess, with a user-space tool trying to
verify permission. I don't think it is good for a root daemon to mess
with user home directories. (not that it can always be avoided of course)
