Look at the portion of your dmesg where AHCI is loaded:
You'll see some lines like this:
[3675853.416077] ahci 0000:00:1f.2: flags: 64bit ncq sntf stag pm led clo pmp pio slum part ems 
[3675855.666834] ahci 0000:04:00.0: flags: 64bit stag led slum part 
Relevant lspci bits:
00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 82801JI (ICH10 Family) SATA AHCI Controller
04:00.0 IDE interface: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88SE6121 SATA II Controller (rev b1)
Notice the 'pmp' flag on the first one. From what I understand, the AHCI
BIOS portions can choose to enable or disable things like PMP support,
and that's why it's reflected in the inquiry data.
Another box:
[    4.396835] ahci 0000:00:1f.2: flags: 64bit ncq pm led clo pio slum part 
And the lspci:
00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 82801GR/GH (ICH7 Family) SATA AHCI Controller (rev 01)
