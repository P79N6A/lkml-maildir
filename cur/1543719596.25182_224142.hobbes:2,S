The easiest way to trigger the error is:
  export the filesystem and mount it on some client.
  On the client, cd into some subdirectory.
  On the server, unexport, unmount, remount, reexport
    (i.e. simulate a reboot).
  On the client "ls -l"
That should cause the server to try to call get_parent to find the
path back up to the root of the filesystem.
A quick glance at the rest of the export related code suggests that it
is all ok.
