Hmm... There has to be an implicit promise here that nobody else will
ever try to set ATTR_KILL_SUID/ATTR_KILL_SGID and ATTR_MODE at the same
time. Currently, that assumption is not there:

Should we perhaps just convert the above 'if (!(ia_valid & ATTR_MODE))'
into a 'BUG_ON(ia_valid & ATTR_MODE)'?
