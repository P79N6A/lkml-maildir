Subject: resizing swap partition? maybe off-topic

ok, the last 2 partitions on my drive are this..
Disk /dev/sda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 1106 cylinders
/dev/sda3          639      639     1101  3719047+  83  Linux native
/dev/sda4         1024     1102     1106    40162+  82  Linux swap
is there any way I can take a chunk off the end of sda3 and then
remake my sda4 to be like 128MB? Without destroying the current info on
sda3.
someone suggested just making a swapFILE on sda3 instead with mkswap.
would there be any performance difference? if not, could i tack my unused
sda4 onto sda3 then or would i have to mount it under a specific
directory to reuse it again?
Thanx,
-Tony
