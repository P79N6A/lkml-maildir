Yes, that's right.

Well, posix_fallocate() either gets all the space or it fails. If
you truncate to extend the file size after an ENOSPC, then that is
a buggy implementation.
The same could be said for any application, or even the fallocate()
call itself if it changes the filesize without having completely
preallocated the space asked....

We've got different modes to specify different behaviour. That's
what the mode field was put there for in the first place - the
interface is *designed* to support different preallocation
behaviours....

How can it be a "backburner" issue when it defines the
implementation?  I've already implemented some thing in XFS that
sort of does what I think that the interface is supposed to do, but
I need that interface to be nailed down before proceeding any
further.
All I'm really interested in right now is that the fallocate
_interface_ can be used as a *complete replacement* for the
pre-existing XFS-specific ioctls that are already used by
applications.  What ext4 can or can't do right now is irrelevant to
this discussion - the interface definition needs to take priority
over implementation....
