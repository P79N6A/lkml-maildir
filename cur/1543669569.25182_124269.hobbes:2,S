If you look at do_softirq() you will see that it enables irqs 
unconditionally while calling pending functions.  It does, however, 
save the irq on entry and restore it on exit (seems strange eh).

IMHO, update_times() is right!  The code fragment you found is wrong. 
  If there is a real need we could code up a check to see if 
local_bh_enable() is called with interrupts off.
As machines get faster and faster, it will be come more and more of a 
burden to "stop the world" and sync with the interrupt system, which 
is running at a much slower speed.  This is what the cli / sti/ 
restore flags causes.  I saw one test where the time to do the cli was 
as long as the run_timer_list code, for example.
