this is the algorithm I added to 2.4 to produce good protection levels (with
lower_zone_reserve_ratio supposedly tunable at boot time):
static int lower_zone_reserve_ratio[MAX_NR_ZONES-1] = { 256, 32 };
		zone->watermarks[j].min = mask;
		zone->watermarks[j].low = mask*2;
		zone->watermarks[j].high = mask*3;
		/* now set the watermarks of the lower zones in the "j" classzone */
		for (idx = j-1; idx >= 0; idx--) {
			zone_t * lower_zone = pgdat->node_zones + idx;
			unsigned long lower_zone_reserve;
			if (!lower_zone->size)
				continue;
			mask = lower_zone->watermarks[idx].min;
			lower_zone->watermarks[j].min = mask;
			lower_zone->watermarks[j].low = mask*2;
			lower_zone->watermarks[j].high = mask*3;
			/* now the brainer part */
			lower_zone_reserve = realsize / lower_zone_reserve_ratio[idx];
			lower_zone->watermarks[j].min += lower_zone_reserve;
			lower_zone->watermarks[j].low += lower_zone_reserve;
			lower_zone->watermarks[j].high += lower_zone_reserve;
			realsize += lower_zone->realsize;
		}
Your code must be inferior since it doesn't even allow to tune each zone
differently (you seems not to have a lower_zone_reserve_ratio[idx]). Not sure
why you dont' simply forward port the code from 2.4 instead of reinventing it.
