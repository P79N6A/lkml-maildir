I think you are right - however, AFAICS this is not the point in this 
case. These drivers do DMA to legacy devices (call it ISA, LPC, whatever). 
The documented way for those devices without struct pci_dev is to call the 
dma api functions with dev=NULL. For i386 the generic dma functions are 
overwritten so they use GFP_DMA f.e. in this case.
According to include/asm-x86_64/dma-mapping.h there is no such override 
for x86-64. Hence the generic implementation is used which Oopses when 
called with dev=NULL in dma_alloc_coherent because it dereferences dev 
unconditionally.

Yes, sure. The point is with current CONFIG_ISA requirement they cannot be 
build on x86-64 - with CONFIG_ISA removed they can, but will Oops. See the 
report Jean was refering to.
I agree !64BIT isn't the clean way to handle this - IMHO x86-64 needs to 
support legacy devices (dev=NULL) in its dma api implementation. If it 
doesn't, I don't see how these drivers might work on this arch.
