The sonypi driver seems to be necessary to catch Vaio hotkey events,
including the sleep button. I've checked a couple of DSDTs, and it seems
that the more recent Vaios are lacking the SPIC entries but still don't
have the sleep button defined. Is there any chance of this driver being
able to catch hotkey events?
Related to that, I have a nastyish hack which lets the sonypi driver
generate ACPI events whenever a hotkey is pressed. Despite not strictly
being ACPI events, this makes it much easier to integrate sonypi stuff
with general ACPI support. I'll send it if you're interested.
