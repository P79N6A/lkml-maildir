It is a prerequisite for ia64 to switch on CORE_DUMP_USE_REGSET.  (It's
also a very low-impact patch easy to convince oneself does nothing on other
machines, and it's in new 2.6.25 code so far used only on x86, powerpc, and
sparc.)  I think those patches are on their way to being merged by ia64
maintainers.  But I don't know what their targets are.  I'm guessing not
til after .25.  Shaohua Li is driving that effort.
Thanks,
Roland
