Thanks. It is strange - I was under the impression that calling
radix_tree_preload() outside the memleak_lock holding would actually
prevent radix_tree_insert() from allocating a node (and therefore call
kmem_cache_alloc and acquire the list_lock). I'll look at the
radix_tree code this weekend. I'm looking at implementing some kind of
RCU mechanism in kmemleak to avoid future problems (might need changed
to radix_tree as well).
