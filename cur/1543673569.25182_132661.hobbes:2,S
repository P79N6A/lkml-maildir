Actually, the PAG was defined to temporarily disable membership in one
or more groups. Every process would normally run in PAG 0, and the
credentials were shared based on the uid. When a user wanted to
'restrict' rights he would initiate a new PAG which provided a more
limited environment.
This is my interpretation of the AFS paper that documents the original
security policies of AFS as it was initially deployed on November 11,
1986.

    The process authentication group is described on pages 22-23 in the
    pdf, 268-269 in the original ACM publication.
