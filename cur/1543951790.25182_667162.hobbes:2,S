Could we get full dmesg for this particular system/problem?
Please also;
- test 2.6.25-rc5 on _your_ system
- verify that configuration of hda and hdb devices is correct
  (master/slave settings)

There is far too much information there (different error messages,
different host drivers, some systems are using libata...) - please
open a new bug entry at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org
 so we can start
"clean" and fully concentrate on fixing this bug.
PS Thanks for bisecting it.
