Fair enough. Just put it in a seperate file, 
add a Kconfig "TEST_MEMLEAK_DETECTOR" tristate option,
depending on "DEBUG_MEMLEAK" and adjust the Makefile accordingly.
That way we can activate it from time to time by loading that module
and you can test it by compiling a new kernel.
RCU and CRYPTO have similiar features.
