After upgrading to linux 2.3.6 I was greeted with sh: liddl.so.2 can not load shared library
indicating running out of memory. This more than moderately suspect immediately after booting
on a P II with 64Mb of memory. Further investigation showed get_unmapped_area in mm/mmap.c
returning a non-page aligned start address which caused do_unmap to die with a result
that do_mmap returnd failure. Ouch!
The following patch appears to badly impact system stability but at least I can run *some*
programs with it applied.

Linux 2.3.6 still regularly locks hard running bootup scripts whether from init or
o.w. (SysRq-k usually works though). 2.2.9 and 2.3.5 at least seem to manage to
get stuck in state D when things get SIGIOT hitting uninteruptable sleep in
down_failed, which sounds like a mutex problem. A reliable way of triggering this
bug is building the gcc 2.95 prerelease or running its test (the test definately
recieves SIGIOT and then enters prepetual uninteruptable sleep).
I am thinking about how feasable a new heap structured list scheduler would be feasable,
so am tracking 2.3.x. The idea would be that priorities are n-bit cyclic numbers (like TCP)
and the rate at which a task's desirability decreases is affected by its scheduling
priority. At the appropiate moment sift_down moves the task down the pecking order. This
would require keeping track of a "base" value for new entrants but should be a lot cheaper
(chaning a key, removing an entry and adding a key are all O(log n)).
[I guess really undesirable jobs could become locked out for a large amount of time but
that could be alleged to be a feature :-)]
Opinions to dps@io.stargate.co.uk about that please. Time to do coding of any sort is at
a large premium right now due to problems booting with a 2.3.x kernel in general and
"real" work (there is a race to publish a quantum crypto result on now... I am definately
in the running).
