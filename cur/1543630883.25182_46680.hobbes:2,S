where is it so much different from the guid flat on directories?  That way
too, you could get rights of a group of which you are not a member.  As
far as I can see, all what has to be prevented, is to create files with
suid flag set within such a folder - not even for a microsecond
(race-condition).  Or do I miss something?  Other issues are quota, but
this problem already exists with guid bit for directories.  And in my case
(mod_php), it is even worse the way it is.

OpenBSD is extremely carefully about security issues.  Thus, it might not
work at all in OpenBSD.  But it works under FreeBSD (as an option which
has to be compiled into the kernel).  This is exactly what I would like to
have for Linux.
