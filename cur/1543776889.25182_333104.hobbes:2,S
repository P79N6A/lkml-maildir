Better. With the hostap_pci driver, after 2 and a half tries, I managed to
get the backup to complete. But I still get lots of errors along the way:

With the hostap_pci driver, the first time I tried to run the backup
(rsync over ssh from workstation next to AP to T30 w/ prism card)
my machine locked up after about 15 minutes. After rebooting, running
fsck, and moving close to the AP I stopped X and tried to run it on
virtual consoles. After about 15 minutes it stopped but the machine
didn't lockup. It was totally idle w/ no network traffic. Running
lsof | grep rsync tool about 20 seconds to respond. After stopping
the interface and reloading the hostap_pci modules I was able to get
network back. Interestingly rsync suddenly resumed where it left off and
eventually completed (resetting the card all the way). Something about
this rsync backup really tickles the system.
Is this a known problem? Is it known to be the driver, firmware,
or what? Could it be my access point (Linksys 802.11b 4 port switch
BEFW11S4 v.2)?
Thanks for your help. Personally I think I'm ok - now that I've sync'd
up the backup should only take a minute or two now. But I'm willing to
explore this if someone wants me to try some debugging.
