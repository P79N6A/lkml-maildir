What is the modem supposed to do if it receives a packet to
transmit after it has been told to suspend?  This is a real
question, I'm not pretending!  I've never thought about or
read about suspend/resume and have no idea how it is supposed
to work.  Should it just reject it, or should it wake the
modem up?
Ciao,
Duncan.
