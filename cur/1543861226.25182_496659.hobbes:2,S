This is pretty cool.  I've read the VT spec a number of times and never 
understood why they included the CR3 caching :-)  I suspect that you may 
even be faster than Xen for context switches because of the hardware 
assistance here.  Any chance you can run your benchmarks against Xen?
You may already know this, but there isn't a CR3 cache in SVM AFAIK so a 
fair bit of the code will probably have to be enabled conditionally.  
Otherwise, I don't think SVM support would be that hard.  The only other 
odd bit I noticed was:

If I read this correctly, you're using a CR3 write as a hypercall (and 
relying on registers being set/returned that aren't part of the actual 
CR3 move)?  Any reason for not just using vmcall?  It seems a bit less 
awkward.  Even a PIO operation would be a bit cleaner IMHO.  PIO exits 
tend to be fast in VT/SVM so that's an added benefit.
