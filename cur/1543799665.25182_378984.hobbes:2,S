Erm, on this diff, you're missing the function
scsi_setup_blk_pc_cmnd()
Unless these patches were split up strangely and it actually went
through in some other patch that wasn't sent to linux-scsi?
I'd just take the diffs out of the current kernel tree:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=a8c730e85e80734412f4f73ab28496a0e8b04a7b
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=c9526497cf03ee775c3a6f8ba62335735f98de7a
I think they'll apply straight to 2.6.13-stable.
