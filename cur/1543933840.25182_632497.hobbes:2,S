I don't think so.

There was an out of tree patch that was floating around that gave people a sys 
or proc interface to the hardware registers - since oprofile doesn't work 
that well on a bash-less system.
I don't think I will have time to look at the patch over the weekend, but will 
do after Jan 1.
