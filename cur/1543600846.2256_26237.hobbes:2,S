The new driver registers a "reboot notifier" with the system.  If MD
continues to perform I/O after the aic7xxx driver's notification routine
is called, the result is undefined.  The aic7xxx driver has already
shutdown the hardware.  Perhaps I should use a different event to indicate
it is safe for me to clean up the hardware?
