Indeed it does. A brown paper bag occasion :-(
Andrew, please apply the following fix on top of the previous patch.
This has been tested with i386 binaries on an x86_64 kernel.
- <linux/perfctr.h>: Change number fields in register descriptors to 64 bits.
  Otherwise i386 binaries break on x86_64 kernels since the descriptors
  get larger alignment and sizes on x86_64 than on i386.
