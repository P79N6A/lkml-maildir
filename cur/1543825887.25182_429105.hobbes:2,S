Same test, but with iodepth=48 for both ncq depth 1 and ncq depth 31.
This gives the io scheduler something to work with for both cases.

Conclusions: the io scheduler helps, NCQ help - both combined helps a
lot. The Samsung firmware looks bad. Additional requests in io scheduler
when using NCQ doesn't help, except for the new firmware Maxtor.
Suspect. NCQ still helps a lot, > 30% for all drives except the Samsung.
