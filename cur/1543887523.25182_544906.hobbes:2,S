This blows up in -mm:
fs/afs/file.c:59: error: 'filemap_nopage' undeclared here (not in a function)
fs/afs/file.c:60: error: unknown field 'populate' specified in initializer
fs/afs/file.c:60: error: 'filemap_populate' undeclared here (not in a function)
because Nick went and renamed half the VM and deleted the other half.
I need to work out what to do with
mm-fix-fault-vs-invalidate-race-for-linear-mappings.patch
mm-merge-populate-and-nopage-into-fault-fixes-nonlinear.patch
mm-merge-populate-and-nopage-into-fault-fixes-nonlinear-doc-fix.patch
mm-merge-populate-and-nopage-into-fault-fixes-nonlinear-fix.patch
mm-merge-nopfn-into-fault.patch
convert-hugetlbfs-to-use-vm_ops-fault.patch
mm-remove-legacy-cruft.patch
mm-debug-check-for-the-fault-vs-invalidate-race.patch
mm-fix-clear_page_dirty_for_io-vs-fault-race.patch
Probably merge them, I guess.  Hugh had concerns, I think over small
additional overhead from the lock_page()?
