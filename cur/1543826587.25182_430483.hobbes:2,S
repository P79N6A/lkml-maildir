I'll go mad if I try to work it out again: I was as worried as you
when I discovered that test in sys_swapon a year or so ago, apparently
without any check on MAX_SWAPFILES; and went moaning to Andrew.  But
once I'd worked through swp_type, pte_to_swp_entry, swp_entry_to_pte,
swp_entry, I did come to the conclusion that the MAX_SWAPFILES bound
was actually safely built in there.
It's those four in swapops.h, and their concatenation in sys_swapon,
that I meant by "macro contortions"; and I think they are safe (or
were prior to swapless migration's -2), whatever the arch does for
the __ones (which drive me even further insane).
Have you no mercy?  Oh, wasn't it rendered safe by the:
#define SWP_TYPE_SHIFT(e) (sizeof(e.val) * 8 - MAX_SWAPFILES_SHIFT)
static inline unsigned swp_type(swp_entry_t entry)
{
	return (entry.val >> SWP_TYPE_SHIFT(entry));
}
