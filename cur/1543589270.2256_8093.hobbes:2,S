Hi,
I have a Sony memory stick in my system. When I display all the
interesting (i.e. not all 0xff and not all 0x00 data), I see (on a
recently formatted stick):
% hd /dev/hde | grep -v "ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff   ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff" | grep -v "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"

However, when I mount the stick on /mnt/d1 I see:
