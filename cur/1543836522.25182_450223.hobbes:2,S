Yes, the patch (as mentioned earlier) does not address SMP correctness
_yet_. That will need to be addressed definitely for an acceptable
controller. My thought was we could try the smpnice approach (which
attempts to deal with the same problem albeit for niced tasks) and
see how far we can go. I am planning to work on it next.

That may solve the load balance problem nicely. But isnt there some cost
to be paid for it (like lock contention on the virtual runqueues)?

Do we want heriarchy?
