Subject: [PATCH -mm 0/3] convert IOMMUs to use iova

This patchset convert the PPC64 IOMMU to use the iova code for free
area management.
The IOMMUs ignores low level drivers' restrictions, the maximum
segment size and segment boundary.
I fixed the former:

The latter makes the free area management complicated. I'd like to
convert IOMMUs to use the iova code (that intel-iommu introduced) for
free area management and enable iova to handle segment boundary
restrictions, rather than fixing all the IOMMUs' free area management,
I converted the PPC64 IOMMU to see how things work. The patchset was
slightly tested with a pSeries box and seems to work.
This is against the latest Linus' git tree with David Miller's
genericizing iova patch:
