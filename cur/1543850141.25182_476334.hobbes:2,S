I'm not directly testing -rc3 as yet...  rc2-mm2 + a few modifications
works on the equipment I'm testing and as I can't afford more lost time
due to faults - I'm keeping to that build for the short term.

repaired by Jeff Dike's patch to fs/proc/array.c
VFAT failure: inode.c patch worked.   Has this been fixed in -rc3?
(email I've reviewed implies no)
HP nx6110 and nx6310 (i945G chipsets) - ACPI S3 and S4 (is that right?)
now fully operational.  speedstep not yet operational on nx6310 (Yonah).
synaptic driver: does not recover in S3 mode on nx7400 () or Acer
TravelMate 8000 (Intel Corporation 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M)
USB UHCI)
Suspect USB host problem as synaptic driver DOES recover on nx6130.
This IS a regression as these worked fine in kernels where S3 formerly
worked.    Video does not yet fully recover on nx7400 - but it never has
so that's not a regression  (backlight fails to recover).
Any idea when Yonah (family 6/model 14/stepping 8) will be supported by
either speedstep, P4 or ACPI driver?   NONE of these work.  P4 did work
briefly (-rc1-git4 and -rc1-git6) but I'm not sure that it's optimal.
acpi-cpufreq hasn't loaded since 2.6.18  (which didn't work properly
with other parts of the laptops so went with 2.6.19 rc series).
