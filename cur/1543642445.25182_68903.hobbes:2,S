Thanks, Dave, you saved me a bunch of typing...
Just looking at a networking benchmark result is worse than
useless. You really need to look at the stats, settings,
and the profiles. eg, for most of the networking stuff:
ifconfig -a 
netstat -s
netstat -rn
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/
/proc/sys/net/core/
before and after the run. 
Dave, although in your setup the clients are maxed out,
not sure thats the case for Mala and Troy's clients. (Dont
know, of course). But I'm fairly sure they arent using
single quad NUMAs and they may not be seeing the same
effects..
thanks,
Nivedita
