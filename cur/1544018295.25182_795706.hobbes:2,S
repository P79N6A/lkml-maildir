No. This does not disable any such special selection criteria which is used

This patch just chooses the task with highest oom.victim among those tasks 
which would have been chosen without this controller. So all the "kill within 
memcg/cpuset" should work as always! It should just kill a task within the 
memcg with highest oom.victim.
