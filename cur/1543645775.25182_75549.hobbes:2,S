This patch was originally written by Martin Bligh.
It changes all references of node_start_paddr and zone_start_paddr 
to node_start_pfn and zone_start_pfn.  This change is required to 
support PAE for i386 discontigmem.  It allows a starting address 
for a node or zone to be greater than 4GB. A version of this patch 
is in the 2.4 aa tree and has also been accepted into the v2.5 tree 
starting with 2.5.34.
I've tested this patch on the following configurations: UP, SMP, SMP PAE, 
multiquad, multiquad PAE, multiquad DISCONTIGMEM, multiquad DISCONTIGMEM PAE.
Any and all feedback regarding this patch is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Pat
