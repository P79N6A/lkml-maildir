Locks definitely _hurt_ performance very badly. Locks don't scale in SMP
so if you lock the bus all the time only once CPU between the NR_CPUS will
run and the other will stall at the first memory bus access. Locks also
prevents the locking-CPU to reorder instructions on IA32. locks hurt also
in UP for this reason.

You are talking about xchg (and it's 64bit variant) but they are
unrelated.
