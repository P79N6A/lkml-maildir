Btw, crossover being screwed up and runnign with RT priority would also 
explain why stracing it makes the problem go away - the tracing will cause 
the RT process to halt at system calls and yield to the tracer, which 
isn't RT.
Of course, the same goes for a scheduler bug, so it's not like this proves 
anything one way or the other, but considering that others aren't 
reporting this problem with other programs..
