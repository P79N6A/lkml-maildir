Subject: [PATCH] kernel/timer.c: xtime lock missing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hello all,
While looking at the time keeping code for related work, I came across 
the following bug.  During 2.5 development, the smptimers patch removed 
a lock from update_times() that is actually needed over the xtime 
update, since the second overflow is not an atomic operation.  This 
patch fixes that by doing a write_seqlock() over the course of the 
update.
