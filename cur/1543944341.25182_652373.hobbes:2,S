Actually I'll usually (much >90%) just queue another patch which fixes the
fallout and will drop that once the upstreams sort things out.
I'll only drop a subsystem tree in extremis.  One reason for this is
that I'll have a pile of other patches which are dependent upon that
subsystem tree and which would need reworking.  And un-reworking once the
subsytem tree is undropped.
And the trees which are most likely to cause conflicts tend to also be
the trees upon which other patches are dependent.  Mainly because those
trees are larger and more spread out.
