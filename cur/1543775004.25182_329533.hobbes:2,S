Your code should not care about the block size of the data given to you,
as userspace could be giving you 1 byte at a time.  Buffer it up
yourself and then write it out to the device when needed.
But if you are doing this for firmware, then please use the kernel
firmware interface, it does all of the buffering for you.
Either way, having your own file_ops in sysfs is not allowed.
