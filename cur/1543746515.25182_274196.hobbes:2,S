Have you notice this behavior with other interactive (I/O) tasks, such
as bash.  Evolution is quite a big utility, and might be doing something
in the background. If you see the same behavior with bash then there is
no doubt that the compile is slowing down an I/O intensive task.
Another variable can be memory. Are you running this on something with
adequate memory, or is you harddrive churning like mad and you're
constantly thrashing the swap space?
