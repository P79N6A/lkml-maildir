yep. The patch also detaches the brk area from the binary's image and
bss, and randomizes it. (this isolates them better and makes it harder
to overflow between these sections.)
For the segment-limit method on non-NX CPUs a non-executable brk (heap,
malloc() space) has another significance: since it must be above the
binary image [there's simply not enough brk space below the binary], the
CS segment limit does not cover the binary's .data/bss sections - hence
that is non-executable as well. [for NX there's no difference - the
.data/bss sections are non-executable.]
but for the mainstream kernel the most important step would be to make
brk non-executable.
