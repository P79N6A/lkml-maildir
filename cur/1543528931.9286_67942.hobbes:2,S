	"Trillian"  See   www.linuxia64.org
	A very early UDI exists at all yet.  (Reference implementation
	version 1.0 is apparently available for UnixWare.)
	A initial UDI driver release for Linux was supposedly to appear
	around 4Q1999, but nothing obvious can be found from SCO's
	pages, nor from   www.project-udi.org
	I don't know where it has been buried.
