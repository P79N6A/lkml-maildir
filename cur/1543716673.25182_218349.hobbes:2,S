I suppose it could. However, one of our design objectives was to 
support multi-threaded server apps where each thread (task) changes 
its class fairly rapidly (say every time it starts doing work on 
behalf of a more/less important transaction). Doing a transition to 
userspace and back may be too costly for such a scenario.
There might also be some concerns with keeping the reclassify 
operation atomic wrt deletion of the target class...but we haven't 
thought this through for userspace classification.

Why just read when you can test as well :-) We just released a testing 
tarball at 
http://ckrm.sf.net
.. any inputs, bugs will be most welcome !
Looking forward to more inputs,
