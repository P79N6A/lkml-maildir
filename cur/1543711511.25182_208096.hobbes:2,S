As Jens said, it depends on how you define barrier ;-)  I define it as
this io will be written after all the previous io and before any later
io.   It was originally written with scsi tags in mind as well, the FS
side was the same for both.
In the end, I'm not that picky though, any reasonable setup that gets
the blocks on media is fine.
