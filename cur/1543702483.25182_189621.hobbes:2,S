Hi,
I have another solution to the same problem. I also use multiple external
interfaces and select outgoing interface via:
ip rule add from IP/range lookup TABLE
With 2.4.23 iptables -j MASQUERADE stopped working, reporting:
MASQUERADE: Route sent us somewhere else.
In my case the solution was to change my masquerade rule
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o IF -s IP/range -j MASQUERADE
to SNAT instead:
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o IF -s IP/range -j SNAT --to-source EXT-IP
With this config everything works as before 2.4.23.
regards
Anders Westrup
