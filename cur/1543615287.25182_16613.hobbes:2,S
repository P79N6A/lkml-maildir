"man klogd", "man ksymoops".
Short:
System.map is an ordered (by address) list of (kernel address, ?type?, 
and syscall name).
Module syscalls are dynamic by nature so there's a kernel interface for 
exporting symbols to user utilities needing their addresses (see 
/proc/ksyms).
You don't need System.map to boot. But user space apps like ps (can show 
the current syscall used by a process), klogd (for clean GPF reports), 
ksymoops (mainly as a cross-check with vmlinux symbols) use it and 
search it in numerous places : with or without `-uname -r` appended (at 
least in / /boot /usr/src/linux).
