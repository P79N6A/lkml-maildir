Sounds eminently fair.  I think the patch has merit so now we know the
symptoms we can spent a little effort to get the kinks out.  Will test
the next -mm as a matter of course.

The crash behavoir is handy to catch that the problem exists, and is
very cheap (0 cost) at run time.  However, once its known I think we
need something more targetted to allow tracking of the cause.  Perhaps
we could set the offset thingy to -1 or something and simply do
something like the following in per_cpu():
	if (__per_cpu_offset[i] == -1)
		BUG();
	else
		*RELOC_HIDE(&per_cpu__##var, __per_cpu_offset[cpu])

No change to the panic's in alloc_slabmgmt.  A very quick review seems
to say that slab percpu data is actually not in percpu space, so that
seems a little odd.  Not had any real time to trace it further.
If you have any other missed ones than this send them along and I'll put
them through the mill.
