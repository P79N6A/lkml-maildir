Ok Jamie, try to explain me which kind of improvement this first drop will
bring. And also, how such first drop would not bring a "confusion" for the
user, letting him think that he can go sleeping event w/out having first
received EAGAIN. Isn't it better to say "you wait for events after EAGAIN",
instead of "you wait for events after EAGAIN but after accept/connect".
The cost of the test will be basically the cost of a ->poll(), that is
exactly the same cost of the very first read()/write() that you would do
by following the current API rule.
