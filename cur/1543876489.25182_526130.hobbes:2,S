You get linear memory. Just get individual pages.
If you want to merge them you can use vmap(),
but in the kernel you should probably just fix your in kernel 
code to not require that and work with sg lists.
If you get the pages piece by piece you can also more easily
remap them linearly into user space.

It probably should, but see second part of sentence above.
And please never put closed lists in cc of l-k posts. Evil cc dropped.
