Yes, it does not work for 8K stacks, but this is something premeditated.
Since private stacks for interrupts are only used when 4KSTACKS
is enabled I felt that to be consistent it should be the same in
the NMI's case. Anyway if it is deemed correct (I agree it is desirable)
I could implement it.
Regarding the impact in performance, note that when we use 4K stacks we
are switching stacks _every_ time an interrupt occurs. I do not see why
we should not do the same for NMIs. Specially since the cost of
switching stacks is relatively small when compared to the cost of
executing the NMI watchdog's handler.

Yes, it could be done, but I think it is safer to use a private stack
all the time, so that the NMI handler does not contribute to an eventual
stack overflow. I would like to avoid the case of the the stack
overflowing inside the NMI handler.
Thanks for your comments.
