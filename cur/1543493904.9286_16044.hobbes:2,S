I did this once... somehow Lose95 conspired to wipe my partition table.... I 
knew that my linux partition was the last one on teh disk so I boted a rescue 
disk and used hexdump /dev/hda | more to serach for the ext2fs superblocks and 
get the sizes from teh correct field.
I couldn';t be bothered with that kind of effor for my VFAT filesystem though 
...
It is possible anyway...
