If your workload is metadata intensive, your data disks are idle; if 
you're reading data, the inode device is gathering dust. You can run out 
of inodes before you run out of space and vice-versa. Very suboptimal.
A symmetric configuration allows full use of all resources for any 
workload, at the cost of increased complexity - every extent has its own 
RAID level and RAID component devices.

Filesystems should use extents, not blocks, avoiding the block size 
tradeoff entirely.
