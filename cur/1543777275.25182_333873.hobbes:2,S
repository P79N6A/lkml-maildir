I did not think that inotify_add_watch called dir_notify.  I don't see a path in which 
calls to add a new inotify watch end up in a call to fcntl_dirnotify or file->dir_notify 
This is for the case in which an app only calls inotify ioctl - ie does not [also] do a call 
to dnotify. 
Without such a call - an app that does your new ioctl to add a watch on a file or directory will
not cause the network/cluster fs to turn on notification on the server since the watch
will be not seen by the client filesystem.

OK - you exported a common underlying function
	inotify_inode_queue_event
under the inline functions which the network/cluster fs would call to notify of remote changes.
That makes sense. I had missed that.
