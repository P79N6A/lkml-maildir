I'd try xfs_repair.  The error above means xfs read something unexpected
for metadata, which did not match the magic numbers it was expecting.  I
suppose the error message could be more informative in that regard...
The buffer it read contained this at the beginning:
0x0: 00 00 00 00 2b 00 00 11 20 21 00 00 00 68 ff ff
but I'm not sure that offers any real insight.
