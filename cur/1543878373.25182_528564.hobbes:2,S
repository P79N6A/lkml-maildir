OK.

Yes, we can do this. But we have a number of architectures which use
sys_clone() to implement kernel_thread(). It would be nice to have an
architecture neutral kernel_thread() implementation as you proposed.
We should change all of them if we want to add a new parameter to
do_fork().
Perhaps it is better to add reparent_kthread() (next patch) to kthread()
and forget about CLONE_KERNEL_THREAD.
Anyway, re-parenting to swapper breaks pstree, it doesn't show kernel
threads. And if ->parent == /sbin/init, we can't remove us from ->children
(unless we forbid sub-thread-of-init exec). So the only safe change is
set ->exit_state = -1.

Yes. But that is what we are doing now. copy_process() just ignores
unknown flags.
