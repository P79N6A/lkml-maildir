Let me provide a bit more detail. I have machines with "Vortex 
boomerang" sound cards. I have a 2.4 driver for same, for OSS, under 
NDA. In 2.6 those cards appear to be supported in ALSA, but using the 
OSS emulation everything seems to work except there isn't any sound.
I've had several people tell me that they are using OSS/2.6 without the 
ALSA utilities. I just want to know if that's possible or not, the 
people with the machines don't want ALSA for reasons I would call 
pigheaded stupidity if they weren't paying me to say "personal 
preference" ;-)
In any case, that's the question, can I get there from here? I can't use 
just OSS, the Vortex drivers are in ALSA.
