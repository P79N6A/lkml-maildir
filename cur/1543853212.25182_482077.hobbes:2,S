Hmm, two things which come to mind are (a) do you have extended
attributes compiled into your kernel and (b) is sudo properly set
up.
But for (a) to be the case, you should be getting EOPNOTZSPUP (98),
not ENOSYS (38).
Could you send me a copy of your .config, tell me which filesystem
you are using, and send the /tmp/straceout after doing
	strace -o/tmp/straceout -f setfcaps cap_net_raw=ep /bin/ping
as root?
thanks,
