they both have have benifits, but it shouldn't have to be either-or
if you build the seperate layers and provide for ways that the upper 
layers can query the lower layers to find what's efficiant then you can 
have some uppoer layers that don't care about this and trat the lower 
layer as a simple block device, while other upper layers find out what 
sort of things are more efficiant to do and use the same lower layer in a 
more complex manner
the alturnative is to duplicate effort (and code) to have two codebases 
that try to do the same thing, one stand-alone, and one as a part of an 
integrated solution (and it gets even worse if there end up being multiple 
integrated solutions)
