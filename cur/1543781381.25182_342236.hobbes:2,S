It's PCI segment 0, bus 0, slot 4, function 0, which is apparently a 3
port serial card (probably the GSP function of a pa8800?)

Yes, it's theoretically possible to have had SCSI do this.  We didn't do
it at the time because class_devices didn't exist when the SCSI tree was
first put together.  It would, however, have rather put the mockers on
doing transport classes since class devices can't point at other class
devices.

That's a choice that's up to the maintainer of the serial driver ...
