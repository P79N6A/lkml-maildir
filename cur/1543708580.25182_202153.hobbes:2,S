But how is "pressure" defined?
Will a heap of busy knfsd processes doing reads or writes exert
pressure?   Or is it only local userspace that can pressurize the VM (by
either anonymously backed memory or file I/O).
This server happily serves large home directories over NFS, at really
poor speeds.  It will happily serve tens or hundreds of gigabytes, read
and write, over the course of a day, and *still* only cache about 100MB
NFS to/from the server is slow. It's common to see 10 knfsd processes in
D state while vmstat tells me the array works with about 4-6MB/sec
sustained throughput (where hdparm -t would give me more than 70MB/sec
on the md device).
The files read and written are commonly in the 20-60 MB range, so it's
not just because I'm loading the server with small seeks. Many files are
read multiple times within a few minutes, so the cache usage of 100MB is
completely bogus the way that I see it - but maybe there's just
something I don't know about the caching?   :)

I never investigated the slabinfo on earlier 2.4. But the performance on
this server has been "under expectations" for as long as I can remember.
So, from the performance experience on this server I would say that
2.4.25 is not any worse than older kernels.
Since this is a production system I have been reluctant to jump on the
2.6 wagon - but my other experiences with 2.6.X have been good, so I'm
probably going to soften up and give it a try in a not too distant
future.
However, if this dcache/icache problem is well known and is (or at least
should be) solved in 2.6, then I can do the test this weekend.
Any enlightenment or suggestions are greatly appreciated :)
Thanks,
