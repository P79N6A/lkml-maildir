You are right it is for compatibility reasons only and I think still
potentialy useful. A dumb could have that permission turned off so it
could not accidently use it but it could be turned on for someone else.
Smart programs should have it set to 0, dumb should be some subset of the
permisible including maybe the null set.

Most are too dumb to raise, only smart ones can and should raise as
needed.

fE is basicly not fM, I think the formula should be:
pI' = pI
pP' = fP | ( fI & pI & pP)
pE' = fE & pP'
How exactly would you fit fE into the formulas that would improve these
equations?
If I understand you correctly you want
pE' = (!fM) & pP'
which gains you nothing. either way stuff dead-ends.
I did kind of like someones idea for f_min
so that if (f_min != (f_min&pE') then EPERM
Used very sparingly f_min might be good.
Without elf I beleive the defaults should be:
fE=pP, fI=pI, fP=0, f_min=0
in untrusted elf headers (not marked with suid or sticky or whatever):
pI' = pI
pP' = fI & pI & pP
pE' = fE & pP'
