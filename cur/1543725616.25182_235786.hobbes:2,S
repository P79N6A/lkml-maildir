I've been having trouble with USB since 2.6.8-rc1; khubd ends up 
blocking on something which makes USB hotplugging stop working (and only 
half my devices even get initialized).  I did get 2.6.8-rc1 to work once 
though it seemed to help inserting modules before calling hotplug.  
However I haven't been able to repeat that during my last 5 attempts 
with no changes besides a reboot.  I'm running 2.6.7-ck5 right now with 
no apparent problems.
I haven't done extensive testing, but things seemed to work OK until I 
plugged in my Belkin F5U231 4-port multi-tt hub.  My other hub is a 
4-port single-tt Belkin F5U224.
I've attached the usb messages from 2.6.8-rc2 booting with the hub 
attached and then the little bit I see in the log if I don't plug-in the 
F5U231 until after the rest of the USB devices have been attached.
Please let me know what further information or action on my behalf will 
help find the solution to this problem.
Thanks
