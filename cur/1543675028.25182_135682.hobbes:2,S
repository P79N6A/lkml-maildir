Subject: [PATCH] Graceful failure in devfs_remove() in 2.5.x
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello!
It's already the second time that I encounter a kernel panic in the same
place.  When devfs_remove() is called on a non-existent file entry, the
kernel panics and I have to reboot the system.
First time it was unregistering of pseudoterminals.  This time it's
ide-floppy module that doesn't register devfs entries if the media is
absent but still tries to unregister them.  The bug in ide-floppy will be
reported separately.
The point of this message is that the failure in devfs_remove() is
possible, especially with rarely used drivers.  Secondly, is not fatal
enough to justify an immediate panic and reboot.  Thirdly, devfs misses a
chance to tell the user what's going wrong.
This patch makes devfs_remove() print an error to the kernel log and
continue.  PRINTK is defined in fs/devfs/base.c to report errors in the
cases like this one:
#define PRINTK(format, args...) \
   {printk (KERN_ERR "%s" format, __FUNCTION__ , ## args);}
The patch:

The patch is against Linux 2.5.70.
Linux 2.4.21-rc4 already has protection against panic although it doesn't
print the error message - see devfs_unlink() in fs/devfs/base.c
