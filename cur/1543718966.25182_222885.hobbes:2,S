Also your point above is a good one. We probably should do a sanity
check to make sure we're getting a reasonable frequency (however then
we'll probably start having troubles w/ systems that have broken PITs ;)
I'll put it on my todo list, but if you'd like to take a swing at ti and
beat me to the implementation, I wouldn't complain.
