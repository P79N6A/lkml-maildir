Yep, this is why I mentioned SCCS format too, I didn't know it was even
smaller, but I expected a similar density from SCCS.

If it wasn't for network synchronization it almost wouldn't matter, but
fetching 2.8G uncompressible when I could simply fetch 220MB
compressible (that will compress with zlib at little cost during rsync
to less than 78M), sounds a bit overkill.

Multiple trees in the sense of pulls from multiple developers aren't
more costly than a normal checkin, due the "soft hardlink" property of
the hashes. It's just every checkin taking lots of space, and generating
a new uncompressible blobs every time a changeset touches one file.
