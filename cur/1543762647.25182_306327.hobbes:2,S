Subject: [PATCH] read_kmem() fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/26/77

drivers/char/mem.c:289
		if (p < PAGE_SIZE && read > 0) {
			[...]
			read -= tmp;
			count -= tmp;
    This part is losting the number of bytes which read.
drivers/char/mem.c:302
			sz = min_t(unsigned long, sz, count);
    This should use "read" instead of "count".
drivers/char/mem.c:315
			read -= sz;
			count -= sz;
    Also lost the number of bytes which read.
In short, kmem returns incorrect number always if user is accessing
the lowmem area. And also it doesn't handle the highmem boundary
rightly.
This patch uses "low_count" instead of "read", as the number of copy
in lowmem area. And "read" is used as the number of bytes which read.
