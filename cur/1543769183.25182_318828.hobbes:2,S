Ok.  Testing seems to show that indeed the initial memory blocks
do not need to be treated specially on ppc64 non-numa systems.
Andrew could you add this to the sparsemem patches please.
Applies on top of 2.6.12-rc4-mm2.
-apw
Testing seems to confirm that we do not need to handle the first memory
block specially in do_init_bootmem.
