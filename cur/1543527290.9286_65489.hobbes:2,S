My goof off this time. I did forgot to use /bin/pwd one of the times... Ufhh...
Still, the strange fact that when using /bin/pwd solaris returns an error and
linux returns a full path is still there. 
pwd (GNU sh-utils) 2.0
strace on linux shows a call to getcwd (3). Return is correct path and no
errors.
truss on solaris shows exactly what you describe. 
Cheers ;-)
