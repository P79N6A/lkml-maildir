Simple reason: shared interrupts
Besides that, what you'd really want is a mask, not
a level. You might like to block out all network
interrupts while still allowing SCSI interrupts.
At some other time, you'd like the opposite.
None of the common hardware (PC, Mac, etc.) is at
all friendly to using a mask, even if you don't
have shared interrupts.
So the policy is: get in, shut the hardware up,
set a flag or wake something up, and get out.
Interrupt handlers are supposed to be very fast
and simple. Put the real work elsewhere.
