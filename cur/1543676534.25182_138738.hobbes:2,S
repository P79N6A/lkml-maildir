hi,
I noticed that when flags (such as append-only) are set on a
directory any new file/dir created in that directory inherits its'
flags.
This is somewhat of a problem with append-only since ext2 only
refrains from doing this on symlinks, not device special files,
therefore if you create a device special node in an append-only
directory the only way to get rid of it is debugfs.
At the very least this should probably be changed to not inherit flags
to non-regular files or directories, but I am also not quite sure the
whole idea really makes sense for all the flags (it makes some sense
for sync, and perhaps noatime, but not so much for append-only).
I am not subscribed to linux-kernel so please CC any replies, thanks.
