Well, I've got the worst of fs and drivers/ata done so far, still
weeping over the 5500 warnings in drivers. (X86_32 allyesconfig).
People ignore the existing warnings anyway, why not toss a few more
on the pile?
I'll look them over tonight and see how bad it would be.

Well, I'm just going through the _trivial_ ones first to try and cut
the noise down a bit.  I think with all the patches I have out there
I've cut a little over 1000 lines off an allyesconfig build on X86_32
so far.
