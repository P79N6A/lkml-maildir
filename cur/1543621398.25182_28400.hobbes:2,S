Good catch!  Messages had been temporarily disabled, but I finished 
adding a message declaration suffix (!) just before your mail came in.
In 2.3.1 your example will look like this.
menu usb        # USB? support
         USB_DEBUG
         usb_options_legend!
         USB_DEVICEFS USB_BANDWIDTH USB_LONG_TIMEOUT
         usb_controllers_legend!
         h:USB_UHCI? h:USB_UHCI_ALT? h:USB_OHCI?
 ...
The reason for this change in design is to make it easier to automatically
generate per-directory distributed symbols files.  But the good thing about
it is that it simplifies the language -- I was able to remove three constructs
and only have to add back one.
