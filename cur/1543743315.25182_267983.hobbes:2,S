More or less, it's true. The value is checked against 2.2.5 for base , 2.4.1 
and 2.6.0 for using NPTL.
On a RH 9, instead, IIRC 2.4.20 is the minimum for using NPTL. More details 
can be found at 
http://people.redhat.com/drepper/
  (there is a 
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL link).

And this means that we must fix UML for NPTL. Also, the problem is strange: 
the child and the father, when created linking with NPTL, get the same pid, 
so os_stop_process (i.e. kill(SIGSTOP, child_pid)) kills the whole process. 
In fact, replacing those with gettid() and tkill() appears to fix the 
problem.
But:
1) This should not happen, since clone() is not called with CLONE_THREAD (I 
verified that CLONE_THREAD is not used even with NPTL, so glibc is not doing 
anything strange here).
2) So, we get a host bug.
3) In fact, on my current Gentoo, Mplayer appears to experience a similar 
behaviour (it stops itself on entry and exit). It could be something 
unrelated, but it seems to me a host bug.
Bye
