Hi,
I understand that people tend to be careful with optimizations
or enhancements. In that regard, this particular patch is a
disputable example.
But, my request has been meant in a broader sense.
This iorl-patch is just one out of roughly a dozen on
both RH's side and SuSE's side. I have been asking
for getting together on the list and trying to match and merge
these piles of patches, which are possibly not all as disputable
as the patch discussed in this thread, i.e. pure (partially
vintage) bugfixes.
If people agree in that course also about a clean, common
iorl-patch, that would be another step forward, in my opinion.
Mit freundlichen Grüßen / with kind regards

I have mixed feelings about that. One on side, I'd love to merge the
scalability patches in mainline. We've had a significant number of bugs
in this area in the past, and it seems a shame that we all have to fix
them independently because we deviate from mainline. On the other hand,
2.4 is pretty much closed. There wont be a big number of new distro 2.4
kernels.
Had you asked me 6 months ago I probably would have advocated merging
them, but right now I think it's a waste of time.
