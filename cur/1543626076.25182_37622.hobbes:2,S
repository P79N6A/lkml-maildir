Here's another run, with noatime on, and default postgres
parameters.
        tuning? single  ir      mx-ir   oltp    mixed-oltp
                (sec)   (tps)   (sec)   (tps)   (sec)
ext3     dn     1296.30 66.34   207.59  69.19   318.26
ext3-wb  dn     1286.38 66.27   212.48  135.48  229.74
ext3-jd  dn     1293.08 68.72   209.33  113.40  283.97
Looks like I'll have to invest some time in tuning postgres
a little better before the filesystem becomes more of a
bottleneck.
