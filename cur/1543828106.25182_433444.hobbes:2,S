Userspace measurements provide only large-grained quantities.  Can you
argue convincingly that there is never a need to measure focused
quantities such as cache behaviors of individual subsystems, branch
prediction statistics of a new algorithm?  That running system-level
benchmarks is the most efficient way for developers to assess their
changes?  That the scheduler would not benefit from access to HT
resource utilization statistics?  All these sorts of efforts seem
to require a kernel-side perfmon API.
