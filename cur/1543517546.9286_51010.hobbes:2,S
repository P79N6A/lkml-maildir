I just found a strange way to freeze (kind of )2.3.29 which otherise is rock
solid for me.
If I try to display the attached GIF using imagemagick from a remote host my
Xserver freezes. That is I start X, rlogin to my notebook, call 'display
22383.rpv' and the mouse disappears. Killing the display command makes no
difference at all.
Now that in itself is not a problem but I cannot do anything from X not even
go back to console. So I thought I found a bug in X and used the notebook to
log back into my machine. This works without a problem. I called ps to find
the X pid but ps never came back.
So I tried to just shut the system down. Shutdown starts and tells me it's
shutting down but hangs before even starting the shutdown process.
To me it looks like the processes are waiting. So hopefully providing the a
way to cause this will hopefully help you find the bug.
Michael
P.S.: Everything works well with 2.2.13.
