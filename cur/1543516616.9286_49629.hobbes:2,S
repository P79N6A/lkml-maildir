I can see LVM getting into a standard kernel but not really ext3 (journalling
ext2) or reiserfs. Ext3 adds stuff to the buffer cache behaviour that needs
further figuring for 2.3.x to make Linus happy. Reiserfs exports half of
the buffer cache into itself and includes extra C files in fs/buffer.c
and has similar questions to solve.
There is also a problem that right now neither ext3 or reiserfs can journal
over software raid.
