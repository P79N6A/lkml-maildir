I would like to find the exact cause of the problem; I suspect, as does 
Andi, that it could just be dormant. You had problems still with 
2.6.18.latest, correct? If I can find the cause, I would like to get a 
fix into 2.6.18-stable if possible. I think you already sent me the 
reproducing kernel config, but I seem to have misplaced it. Could you 
resend? I should have some time to look at this early this week.
Thanks,
Zach
