Well ... I still don't understand what you're suggesting, so I
guess I will have to wait for an actual patch incorporating it.
Are you also objecting to converting "can_try_harder" to an
enum, and getting the values in order of desperation?  If so,
I don't why you object.
And there is still the issue that I don't think cpuset constraints
should be applied in the last attempt before oom_killing for
GFP_ATOMIC requests.
I will await the next version of the patch, and see if it meets
my concerns.  I am missing a couple too many clues to add more
at this point.
