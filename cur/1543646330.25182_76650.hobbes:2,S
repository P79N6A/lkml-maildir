This isn't a recent change at all, I know it is at least 6 months old
because it was included in 
BitKeeper version is bk-2.1.6-pre5 20020330075529 for x86-glibc22-linux

Distributions do not *SELL* CVS, they distribute CVS.  We choose those
words with care for exactly that reason.  All the clause is saying is
that if you are a competitor you don't get to use our product for free.
That it, in our opinion, a perfectly reasonable position to take.

The clause is specifically designed to target those companies which 
produce or sell commercial SCM systems.  That's why we explicitly 
left out "distribute".  The open source developers have nothing to
worry about.
