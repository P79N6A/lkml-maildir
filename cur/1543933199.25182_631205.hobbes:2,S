ls /proc/acpi/video/
shows two identically named directories "VGA" - is this normal??
Anyway,
# cat VGA/DOS
DOS setting: <1>
# echo 3 > VGA/DOS
# cat VGA/DOS
DOS setting: <3>
but no image on external.  Now
# rmmod video
# echo 3 > /sys/devices/platform/asus-laptop/display
Got image on external
# modprobe video
# cat VGA/DOS
DOS setting: <0>
I can write 1 or 3 to DOS and read it back, but it has no effect (image on 
external turned on while video module was removed does not go away).
Please Cc: me on replies - forgot to mention this in the initial posting.
Thanks!
