At present, even though kexec support is included for PPC32, I believe, 
it has been actively tested/maintained only on gamecube.
Michael, if you are OK with this patch, please send it to upstream.
Thanks

 This patch will fix the above build errors on ppc32 with CONFIG_KEXEC.  
Both reserve_crashkernel() and overlaps_crashkernel() should be moved to 
machine_kexec.c() after the kdump support is included on ppc32.
