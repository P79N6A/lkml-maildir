Well, that's the latest I get under FC5:
[asuardi@sandman ~]$ rpm -q wireless-tools
wireless-tools-28-0.pre13.5.1
 but indeed (-git11 minus the reverts) iwconfig says
[asuardi@sandman ~]$ iwconfig eth1
Warning: Driver for device eth1 has been compiled with version 21
of Wireless Extension, while this program supports up to version 19.
Some things may be broken...
The criteria for the revert was actually "take out anything that
 might remotely hit ipw2200 or wireless" - it was basically to
 first rule out that either my WPA configuration or anything in
 my environment could be at fault.
If you have suggestions about either upgrading wireless-tools
 from a non-FC5 repository or narrowing down the reverts, I'm
 up for giving them a go :)
Thanks, ciao,
