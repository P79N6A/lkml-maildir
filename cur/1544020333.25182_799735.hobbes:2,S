Hi,
After the recent discussion with Linus, I have the following three fixes of the
PCI PM framework.
The first patch fixes the bug that bridges (and PCIe ports) are disabled
during suspend, althouth they shouldn't.
The second one makes the PCI PM core handle devices more carefully (details
in the changelog). [Note to Linus: devices are still put into low power states
with interrupts on after this patch.  Moving that to the late suspend phase
will be the next step.]
The last patch makes the warning in pci_legacy_suspend() more useful.
Thanks,
Rafael
