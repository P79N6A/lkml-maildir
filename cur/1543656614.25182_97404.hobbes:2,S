Forgive my ignorance (if this applies) but I recently submitted a patch
acked by both you and gregkh. If there are difficulties with it I'd be
much obliged to hear of them and will resolve them with the utmost
urgency. Aside from that my only concern is that it did not appear in
your changelog. If it's been deferred to a later push that is also okay
with me.
Linus, please do not take this concern as any opposition to the
inclusion of this patch and review it entirely independently of this.
I'm only exercising due diligence with respect to an API update I sent
which should have zero impact on correct functionality, and the omission
of my patch has no implications wrt. the properness of the changes sent
in this submission.
Thanks,
Bill
