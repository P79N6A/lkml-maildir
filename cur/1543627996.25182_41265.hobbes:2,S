I don't know about Intel, but the Athlon doesn't appear to save anything 
in the "reserved" areas.  The values that I use to initialize the state 
are from what is saved after loading the stack with zeroes (fldz) and 
then doing finit.  I have samples of the saved state from a P2, a K6-2, 
and an Athlon XP.
Attached is a revised patch.  I had the cpu_has_xmm test wrong.
