Try the following for playing mp3's from CD. It basically copies the next mp3
to HD while playing the previous one. (I did this not due to skips, but
because the battery of the notebook lives way shorter if the CD keeps
spinning up and down during a song)
#! /bin/sh
case `uname` in
   Linux)
      rt=1
      ;;
   *)
      rt="";
      ;;
esac
tmp1=/tmp/amp.1
tmp2=/tmp/amp.2
trap "rm -f $tmp1 $tmp2" EXIT
j="$1"
shift
cp -f "$j" $tmp1
for i in "$@"; do
   cp -f "$i" $tmp2 &
   echo $j
   if test "$rt"; then
      rt -f -- amp -q $tmp1
   else
      amp -q $tmp1
   fi
   wait
   mv -f $tmp2 $tmp1
   j="$i"
done
echo $j
if test "$rt"; then
   rt -f -- amp -q $tmp1
else
   amp -q $tmp1
