THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN COMMON!
Nobody in their right mind thinks that "disable DMA" and "suspend" are 
similar operations.

It is *not* correct to "suspend" when you want "freeze".
I don't understand how you can even *claim* something like that.
Here's a trivial example:
 - SCSI disk
Tell me, what does "suspend" do, and what does "freeze" (snapshot) do?
And name *one* thing that have in common.
I'll tell you: Nada. Zero. Zilch. Nothing.
"Freeze" for a disk is a total no-op. There is no DMA, there is no 
nothing. In contrast, "suspend" for a disk is a totally valid operation.
Anybody who claims that these two operations are "related" is a moron.
I'm sorry Pavel, but that's exactly how it is.
