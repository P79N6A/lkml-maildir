Wow. This is hard to believe. The i2c-viapro driver only cares about
the SMBus interface of the VIA south bridge. I have a hard time
imagining how it could have any effect on networking.
Is the skge ethernet an on-board thing or an external adapter? I guess
the former. Do you have the detailed hardware specification for that
machine? I wonder if the ethernet chip could be somehow connected to
the SMBus.
Does the SMBus work on that machine? (Probably easier to test with
CONFIG_I2C_VIAPRO=m and CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV=m.) I would also like to
know if there is anything in the logs when loading the i2c-viapro
driver.
What I2C chip drivers did you include in your kernel? Presumably this
is a random config, so I can imagine that there is a chip on the SMBus
to which an I2C chip driver would have bound and that is causing the
problem, rather than i2c-viapro itself.

Can we please also have the output of lspci -nn?
