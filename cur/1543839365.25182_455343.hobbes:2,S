I think configfs provides all the required functionality that you
listed. You can define the attributes in a such a away that it prints
all the information that you need in one single read operation (I think
the limit is PAGE_SIZE....which is kind of sad).
I've just started playing with configfs for a container implementation
that I'm trying to get a better idea of details.

There should be an easy interface for shell to be able to do the needful
as well, for example, set the limits.
