Hello all,
I'm sorry, but this time I found a massive mount-problem with kernel
2.4.9. What have I done?
I tried to mount a cd-rw in my E-IDE cdrecorder with 'mount /cdburn'
(/dev/sr0 with scsi-emulations-modules). Unfortunately the cdrecorder
couldn't read the cd-rw. But mount-program hanged up and the kernel
flooded my messages-file with thousands of the following messages:
Aug 23 23:06:50 athlon kernel: SCSI host 0 abort (pid 0) timed out -

Aug 23 23:06:50 athlon kernel: SCSI bus is being reset for host 0
channel 0.

I wasn't able to kill mount (even as root with sig 9). The only way to
stop it, was to reboot :-( .
I tried it with cdrecord -reset. Didn't help.
I tried it with cdrecord -scanbus. Didn't help.
BTW: I could fetch my cd from my cdrecorder though mount has been
hanging. The cdrecorder didn't lock.
Could you please fix this bug?
Regards,
Andreas Hartmann
