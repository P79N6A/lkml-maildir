Actually I am having a discussion with a Pax Team member about how the 
recent exploits discovered by the grsecurity guys should have been 
handled.  They clam that they sent email to Linus and Andrew and did not 
receive a response for 3 weeks, and that is why they released exploit 
code into the wild.
Anyone here have any comments on what I should tell him?
Thanks,
Steve Bergman
