   While I'm reading the datasheet for the (EXAR) ST16550, this is an uart
   with fifo's, I'm beginning to believe that the serial driver should
   maintain a copy of this write-only register.
   I understand (from this info) that when bits that are programmed i.e. FIFO
   RX or TX trigger level the others must be re-written or they will be
   lost(reset).
The contents of the FIFO Control Register (FCR) is recalculated each
time we need it in change_speed(); since it's relatively trivial to
recalculate it, there's no point in saving a copy of it somewhere.
