Hello all.
	In the last few weeks I have aquired a Matorx ATA 66 hardisk which
I am thinking about getting a add on card to support. However I have no
idea which "chipset" are support under the 2.2.XX tree. Would someone here
be as kind as to point out where i can find this information or give me
such info him/her self.
Thanks
Sebsatian Ip
