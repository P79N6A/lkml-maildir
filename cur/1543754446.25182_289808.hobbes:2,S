Furthermore, the EC and the i8042 are often the same chip, resulting in
the i8042 not answering when EC is busy. Enabling interrupts won't help.

I still hope we could get those in after the handoff code is ironed out.
It kept (keeps?) crashing some machines and not using USB is an easy way
out of this if you don't have the handoff in the early init code.

We may be able to loosen the checks again now that 98% of machines do
have the PS/2 mouse port if they have the AT keyboard port.

Agreed. I'll check them tomorrow in detail and if I find them OK (I
expect to), I'll merge the patch to my tree. Unfortunately I don't
expect the delays themselves will fix much.
