The easy way to handle this is actually to ask kbuild to compile the
file in question.
Example:
$ make arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.o
This wil perfectly fine compile boot.c - no need to hassle with copying
long gcc command lines.
A shorthand exists for compiling all built-in files in a directory
as well. Very useful when working on a subsystem.
Assuming ext2 is built-in try out:
$ make fs/ext2/
And as already pointed out, the easy way to enable to verbose
output is to use:
$ make V=1
