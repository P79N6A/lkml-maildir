European copyright directive and existing UK law already forbid circumvention of
a copy protection device. They don't cover talking about security flaws, 
arresting foreigners who didn't break a law in their own country, and they 
permit reverse engineering for compatibility. 
You only think this is a free country. Like the US the UK spends a lot of 
time explaining its a free country because its a police state.
