eh....
I think you missed a few things..
like
1) This is per architecture already for the most part!
   arch_align_stack() is obvious per architecture already
   the mmap randomisation also happens in arch/<foo>/mm
   and this is per arch by definition as well
2) you missed that the mmap randomization is *ON TOP OF*
   the stack randomization. So while you say "1Mb" in your
   doc in practice it is 8Mb
Also your patch is still full of XXX's and "other noise"... 
Also you probably should explain what the advantage is over the existing
per architecture approach. Just stating "it's per architecture" (as you
suggest) doesn't cut it since it is per architecture already for the
most part.
If all you want to do is turn 
-       if (current->flags & PF_RANDOMIZE)
-               random_variable = get_random_int() % (8*1024*1024);
that 8 into a per architecture thing.. then your patch is awefully big
and complex to just achieve that.
