Under both 2.6.0test4 and test6, I'm fairly regularly getting the
following at boot time:
 MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, correctable incident occurred on CPU 0.
 Bank 0: e603800000000175
The machine is a Compaq Presario 711, with a 950MHz Mobile Duron
(family 6 model 7 stepping 1 according to /proc/cpuinfo).
The Intel docs seem to imply that this is something memory-related, I
couldn't find the relevant AMD docs.
Would somebody be so kind as to explain what the above means?
Thanks,
                                        Juliusz Chroboczek
P.S. I will try to check the list archives, but would appreciate it if
     you could CC me with any reply.
