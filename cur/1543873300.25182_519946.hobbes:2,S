Now you said to check the return value of time_pps_readlink.  Well it
returns void so that isn't much good, and the stuff the wiki says to do,
appears to be done internally by the function.  So I guess that means I
should undo that change so that I can actually get ntpd to compile
again.
If the call was to readlink directly it needs to be done, while your
time_pps_readlink is just a handy wrapper that does all that for you,
right?
