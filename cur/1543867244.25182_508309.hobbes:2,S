It doesn't make much sense for an architecture independent structure to
be "defined" in different ways by specific architectures. "not
supported" or "currently broken" might be a better description.
Your description of the node is correct, it's an arbitrary container of
one or more resources. Not only is this definition flexible, it's also
very useful, for memory hotplug, odd types of NUMA boxes, etc.
