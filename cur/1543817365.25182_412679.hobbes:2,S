Antonio,
 > Maybe "ssize_t psplice(int fdin, int fdout, size_t len, off_t
 > fdin_ofs, unsigned flags);"
yep, thats clearer
I think ideally splice() would just be changed to always take a off_t
as the interface is so new hopefully no apps depend on it yet. Then we
don't need psplice(). 
A while ago we got bitten with tdb in Samba and systems that only have
write(), and no pwrite(). If a process forks then accesses the db in
both parent and child the shared seek pointer semantics of inherited
file descriptors causes races with seek/write. It would be nice if
splice() was immune from this from the start.
If people want it both ways, then an alternative would be to have a
SPLICE_FLAG_OFS_CURRENT flag to splice(), which would tell splice() to
ignore the off_t and use the current seek ptr. I guess that would save
some book keeping for some apps that know they don't have any seek
races and want to always write at the current position. I wouldn't
need this, but some people might find it convenient.

I thought about that, but Stephen convinced me it was a bad idea, as
the semantics with whats in the pipe buffer at any one time gets too
messy if the output is a socket. I guess you could return -EINVAL if
you used the fdout_ofs and its not a seekable file, but that seems to
be overloading the system call too much for my liking.
