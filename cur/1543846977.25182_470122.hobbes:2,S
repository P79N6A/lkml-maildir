Subject: [PATCH 00/14] UML: simple changes for 2.6.19
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/5/361

This is the first set of patches for UML for 2.6.19 I send - I have various
other patches to merge but I'm sending them in separate batches to avoid
flooding.
This first batch consists of:
* compilation/linking correction to merged patches (both from Jeff and from me)
in different configurations (including fixing up Pcap and crypto-modules
compilation)
* some longly needed changes to Kconfig entries (deprecate TT mode, update some
comments, add HOST_VMSPLIT config option to match host's VMSPLIT option).
