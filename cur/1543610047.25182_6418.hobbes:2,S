Hm, I've checked this out, but - no matter if I enable/disable Keyboard
Power ON and/or Wake On LAN, my /proc/acpi/gpe ever contains:
GPE0: 0f 00
Status: 00 00
Btw. If I disable one of them in the BIOS, it definitely does not work
then anymore, if I enable it, it works again - just before you consider
them as fakes :).

Thanks :) Do you have an idea about when this comes up? :)

Well, I have no idea about ACPI to be exact, but regarding to the not
changing GPE in my case, I could imagine that the meaning for my board
is different :)
