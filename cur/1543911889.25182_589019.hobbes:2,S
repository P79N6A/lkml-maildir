Subject: nfs server patches for review

Precedence: bulk

These are some nfs server patches I intend to submit for 2.6.24.
I'm also keeping this sort of thing in the nfs-server-stable branch, at
	git://linux-nfs.org/~bfields/linux.git	nfs-server-stable
That repository has a bunch of random other (mainly nfs-related)
projects, but that particular branch is reserved for nfsd patches that I expect
to be ready in time for the next merge window.  If you have something
nfsd-related that I've overlooked, please let me know.
Nothing earth-shaking here right now, just minor cleanups, bugfixes, and
support from Peter Staubach for reporting 64 bit inode numbers.
