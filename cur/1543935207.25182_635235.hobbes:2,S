Subject: [PATCH][FIX] Bluetooth: always send explicit hci_ll wake-up acks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/7/191

In the (rare) event of simultaneous mutual wake up requests,
do send the chip an explicit wake-up ack. This is required
for Texas Instruments's BRF6350 chip.
