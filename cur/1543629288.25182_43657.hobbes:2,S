You're going to hate me, but I'm going to ask you to do one more thing: 
make "mk_pte_phys()" go away, and replace it with "pfn_pte(pfn,prot)". 
Because logically it _is_ the reverse of "pte_pfn()", and that also means 
that the HIGHMEM stuff on x86 would get cleaned up (we can generate 
highmem pages without having a 64-bit physical address, we just have the 
same old 32-bit PFN).
Pretty please?
