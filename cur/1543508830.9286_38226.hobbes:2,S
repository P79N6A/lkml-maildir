please show numbers.  I've tried chip-specific compile options before
and never seen any measurable difference in kernel performance.  this 
is exactly what I expected, of course, since the kernel is basically
not ever compute-bound.  do you have specific cases where compilation
makes a measurable difference in kernel performance?
