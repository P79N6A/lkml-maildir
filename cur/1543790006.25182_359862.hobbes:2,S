Oh, this seems to be either not intended or misguided.
DEBUG_KERNEL should do nothing more than showing the debugging
options. 
E.g. I don't expect to enable any additional code in an 
unrelated file, if I enable Magic-SysRQ on an embedded, unattended device
to be able to analyze potential problems via serial console.
@Andrew: Would you accept a patch to fix that?
My idea to put the option into lib/Kconfig.debug was just to ease 
maintainence, once it is dependend on DEBUG_KERNEL.
On the other hand it makes sense to add another option TEST_KERNEL
and put some existing kernel internal test suites under that.
@Andrew: Would you accept a patch for this?
