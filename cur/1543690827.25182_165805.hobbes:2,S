Then allow the usage and functionality of the SYMBOLS and not "steal" them
from usage.  If you say thay can be used without support.
PS it is "The Troll" again.
Just execute the reject of the License and have the means to reject
support.  You are so full of it to say it is for rejecting support when
anyone knows it removes usage of the SYMBOL == API.
