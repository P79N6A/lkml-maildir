This seems to be true, but not for what you might think.
It appears that if u plug the USB/serial device back into the usb-hub, 
the code creates a /dev/ttyUSB1 ( if you have not yet closed the 
disconnected /dev/ttyUSB0. ) When you do close /dev/ttyUSB0, then the 
device is erased from the /dev directory.
Now /dev/ttyUSB1 is the device. And /dev/ttyUSB0 disappeared. This does 
not seem proper. As now the program has no idea or capability to re-open 
the GPS device.
I have been informed that this was an approved kernel feature. Is this 
suppose to happen? Or was it an unintended consequence?
