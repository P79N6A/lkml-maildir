Strange. I've worked on several machines where it could.
The 0xC0000 is a physical address only as far as the bridge is concerned
(if the bridge even implements it - not all do). The PCI bus or busses
may not even be the root busses of the system. On such systems you can
happily have multiple PCI root bridges each in their own address space
and each with their own idea of where 0xC0000 maps if anywhere.
