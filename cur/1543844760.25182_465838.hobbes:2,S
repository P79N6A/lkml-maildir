In general it is possible to use a tap interface to tunnel Ethernet
packets. But this driver uses the EtherIP protocol defined in RFC 3378
which itself defines an own IP protocol for it (number 97). This
protocol is also supported by different other operating systems (some of
the major BSD versions). This driver makes Linux interoperable with
these implementations.
