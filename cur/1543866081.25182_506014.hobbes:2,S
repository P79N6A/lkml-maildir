David didn't really spell out the rationale.  Userspace people ask "how
much memory is my application using".  For system planning and such.  We
don't know, really.  So the approach taken here is to nuke all the
referenced bits and to then monitor them coming back over time.
Obviously it doesn't work very well if the page scanner is doing things,
but one hopes that when someone is instrumenting their application they'll
ensure that sufficient memory is available to prevent this inaccuracy.
The other part of the question is of course pagecache.  Hopefully /proc/pid/io
will suffice for that, probably in combination with /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.
I don't really have a sense for how much stuff we want to put into the kernel
to support this sort of thing.  The proposed patches are, I think, minimal.
Perhaps it needs more.  If so, opinions are solicited before we go and add
(and hence be forced to maintain) this new interface.

That's what Paul Davies' patches are aimed at:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mm&m=115276500100695&w=2
I promised Paul that I'd take a serious look at those patches next time
they pop up.   It would be good if others could help out in that.
