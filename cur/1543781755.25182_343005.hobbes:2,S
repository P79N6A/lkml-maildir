In the real world, to be really sure that you're not doing a trip out to
the disk, you'll need a daemon which doesn't do any allocations between
when it's notified and when it does the write to the control file.
In reality, that probably means a statically compiled daemon that
mlock()s itself, and any structures that it will need.  It _might_ even
need to keep an open file descriptor on the "frozen" file.  Because, in
theory, that file could be written out to the sysfs backing store.
