Hi,
I am getting strange errors (and a nonfunctional
network) from my SMP system and the wd80x3 driver.
The remote site sees my packages and replies to
them. I can transmit perfectly but the replies
never make it correctly :(
mirkwood:/etc/rc.d# ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:C0:22:7E:60  
          inet addr:10.0.0.1  Bcast:10.0.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:1408 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:26

          collisions:4240 
          Interrupt:10 Base address:0x310 Memory:cc000-d0000 
mirkwood:/etc/rc.d# 
The collisions were from when I connected the (crossed)
cable to a normal port and the TX errors are from
periods where the cable was disconnected...
Does anyone know what could have caused the receive errors
and/or how I can solve them?
cheers,
