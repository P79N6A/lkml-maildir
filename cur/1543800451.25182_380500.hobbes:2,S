REPORTING-BUGS should probably be fixed to make the points you repeatedly have 
to make. I agree 100% that people should not be reporting easily reproducible 
bugs with proprietary drivers loaded; what's a reboot to them?
Let's add something to REPORTING-BUGS about tainted kernels and/or proprietary 
drivers. A quick grep of this file from 2.6.15-rc6 gives me no hits for 
"proprietary", "tainted" or "binary".
