I have been playing around with linux on an ultra60,
and have had some struggles with the kernel.
The most annoying one is that somewhere in between
kernels 2.4.7 and 2.4.12 someone delete the define
of INIT_MMAP from the processor.h of sparc64, which
doesnt really help when trying to compile a kernel.
Putting in the define of 2.4.7 got me on the way.
So putting it back might be a nice idea ;)
Ow well, still better as solaris, for my purposes
atleast.
