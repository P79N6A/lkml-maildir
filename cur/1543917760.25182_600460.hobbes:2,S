I've been leading with code, and working on the documentation
less agressively. I will pick up the text pace.

That would be OK by me. Thank you.

Yes, haven't been pushing, don't know, and haven't a clue.

Over time the Smack application changes will fairly
closely follow those for SELinux, e.g. cron, login,
su, the MLS window environment. There won't be a major
set of new applications or libraries as there isn't a
policy compliation step involved.

Will do.

Current feedback says they need more work.

The ruleset code was completly revised in Version 2.

Paul was the first person to whom I sent the patch. I would be
delighted to have him review it again.

The original intent was an "external" vs "internal" distinction,
but it greyed over time. I will look at cleaning this up.

Thank you. The current set of interfaces and practices make
kernel coding much easier than it was back in the Unix days.
