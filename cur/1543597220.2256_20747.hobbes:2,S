Yes there is a slight window there, but fsync_dev() serves to flush out the
majority of outstanding I/Os to disk (it waits for I/O completion).  All
of these buffers should be on disk, right?

As soon as we set LOCK_PE, any new I/Os coming in on the LV device will
be put on the queue, so we don't need to worry about those.  We have to
do something like sync_buffers(PV, 1) for the PV that is underneath the
PE being moved, to ensure any buffers that arrived between fsync_dev()
and LOCK_PE are flushed (they are the only buffers that can be in flight).
Is there another problem you are referring to?
AFAICS, there would only be a large window for missed buffers if you
were doing two PE moves at once, and had contention for _pe_lock,
otherwise fsync_dev to LOCK_PE is a very small window, I think.
However, I think we are also protected by the global LVM lock from
doing multiple PE moves at one time.

Yes, I never thought about GCC optimizing away the two references to the
same var before and after making the check.

Yes, well the correct solution is to do it all in a kernel thread, so
that you don't need to do kernel->user->kernel data copying.  I already
discussed this with Joe Thornber (I think) and it was decided to be too
much for now (needs changes to user tools, IOP version, etc).  Later.
Cheers, Andreas
