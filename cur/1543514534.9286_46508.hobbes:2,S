   I don't see the advantages of considering two dparent pointers
   distant less than 32bytes as the same randomizing value. IMHO this
   will only decrease the effect of the randomization we get from the
   parent address.
SLAB will L1_CACHE_ALIGN all dentry structures.  Did you trace the
code in question to see what the input values to the hash actually
look like?
