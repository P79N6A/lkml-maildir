Hi Alok,
Thanks very much for doing these numbers. Performance is improved
significantly at smaller numbers of tasks, as you say.
Unfortunately I can't pinpoint the reason why performance drops at
larger numbers. I could assume that the last remaining place that
used read_lock_irq for the tree_lock (wait_on_page_writeback_range)
got hurt when switching to spinlocks, but that would seem vary
unlikely.
I'll have to look into it further.
Thanks,
Nick
