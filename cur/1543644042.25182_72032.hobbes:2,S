Ok, applied.
I'm also applying the session handling changes to tty_io.c as a separate
changeset, since the resulting code is certainly cleaner and reading
peoples areguments and looking at the code have made me think it _is_
correct after all.
And as a separate changeset it will be easier to test and perhaps revert 
on demand.
