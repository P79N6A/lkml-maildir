Most of the code in then NFS/lockd/sunrpc uses the rpc_allocate()
function, which sleeps when memory is too low. Normally this sort of
thing should therefore not be a problem. There are a few exceptions
though (have a look at nlmproc_cancel() for a particulary evil
example)...
If something is sleeping in rpc_execute() though, the reasons are
likely to be more complex. rpc_execute() does not allocate any memory,
but is the main function for the SunRPC finite state machine. It may
be that the locking request is blocking for some reason. I'd need a
tcpdump and possibly a dump of the RPC debugging code in order to say
more.
Cheers,
