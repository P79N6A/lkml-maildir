OK, thanks.  I uploaded that to

So we have a use-after-free in tasklet_action(), as a consequence of
unplugging a USB ethernet adapter.
The post-2.6.17 changes in drivers/usb/net/ are relatively modest, but
certainly enough to cause lifetime problems.  Do you know whether mainline
has the same bug?  And are you able to identify at which kernel version
this started to happen?
Thanks.
