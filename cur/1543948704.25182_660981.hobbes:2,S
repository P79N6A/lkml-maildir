Indeed, but it's fairly unlikely that such an application would do so
using multiple instances of these particular controllers.  They are all
primary-only devices so having more than one of them in the system
requires multiple AC97 controllers which is pretty unusual.  They're
also multi function devices with audio CODECs as well - people would be
relatively unlikely to use them for the touchscreen functionality alone.
If someone does come up with an application which needs more than one of
these we can deal with it then but it's not an issue for most applications.
