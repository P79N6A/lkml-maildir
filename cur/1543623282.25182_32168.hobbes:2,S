Subject: Raising an disabled tasklet / VC/KBD initialization bug.

Hallo,
I just ran into the following situation on x86-64 on 2.4.17. I think
2.5 has the same problem. 
For some reason vc_init executed in init order after kbd_init
(they are both indirectly called via __initcall so it can happen) 
vc_init does a tasklet_schedule for the keyboard tasklet in 
set_leds.  The keyboard tasklet had not been enabled yet because kbd_init
didn't execute.
Result was an raised tasklet that wasn't enabled.  schedule was called
and ran the softirqs.  tasklet_action always tried to execute it, but 
returned on the non zero count. The tasklet was still active. ksoftirqd
noticed that and executed do_softirq again -> endless loop. 
For now I just removed the set_leds() call in reset_terminal to work around
it. The real fix would be either to add an mechanism to support raising
of disabled tasklets properly or make sure kbd_init and vc_init have defined
init order and the first always executes before the second. 
Comments?
