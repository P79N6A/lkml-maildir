Actually the day we have rm utf-8-ed, we have a problem. Someone will
create two files that have same utf name, encoded differently, and
will be in trouble. Remember old > \* "hack"? utf-8 makes variation
possible...
If we are serious about utf-8 support in ext3, we should return
-EINVAL if someone passes non-canonical utf-8 string.
