Hi,
I have a small question, 
I am not sure if it belongs to kernel.
I often use ldd to find librarys needed.
In some systems,the address display by ldd not
changes,
But in other systems, it changes.
What is the reason of the difference?
Is it cause by some setting in kernel?
Thanks in advance.
gan
