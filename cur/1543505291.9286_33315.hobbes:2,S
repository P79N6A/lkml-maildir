Actually the custom hardware - a storage controller has lot of cache 
in it, and there is this custom nic card which can access the this 
cache memory in a "peer-to-peer" mode in a private data bus.
I want to optimize network related disk access by avoiding 
buffer copies into the main RAM.  (Nic card will directly pick up
data from storage controller card.)
I do not want apps running on the host machine itself to get 
adversely impacted.  
I was planning to bypass buffer cache for nfs *alone* - but now as 
you've told me that's not possible I am wondering what could 
be other way out.
I do not mind patching nfs server or writing device driver 
but I do not want to patch the kernel as I finally want it 
running on a stock kernel.

How is the general problem of "peer-to-peer" access of hardware
addressed in linux?   Is there a generic way hardware can pass
data bypassing copies to host memory.
