Hi Riku, this is the first message I have received.
According to the latest specification update
(
http://www.intel.com/design/iio/specupdt/27351910.pdf
) there are no
known issues with the i2c.  I looked through the thread and did not
see what board you are using, can you send those details?
I have not dealt with the i2c-iop3xx driver in the past. Have you
tried contacting the last person to make functional changes to the
driver?
