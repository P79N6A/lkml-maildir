Actually, English Profanity is about as close to a "Universal Language" as we 
are going to get.  Many of the Hong Kong movies I have have english 
swearwords, while the rest of the film is in Cantonese and/or Mandrin.
The purpose of error messages is to communicate.  If the error message is 
clearer with "The scsi subsystem screwed the pooch", then no one should bitch 
about it.  (Though, in my opinion, it should describe the hows and whys of the 
pooch screwing, as well as pointing out that it had occured.)
