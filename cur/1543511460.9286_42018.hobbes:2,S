Just a "me, too" response...
I see the same thing on my 2.2.x machines with a dead NFS link...
on 2.2.6:
   0     0 14168     1   0   0    732   400 end         D   ?   0:00 df -h
   0     0 14182     1   0   0    732   400 end         D   ?   0:01 df -h
on 2.2.11-ac3:
000     0  6770     1   0   0  1076  456 rpc_ex D    ?          0:00 df -h
000     0  6785     1   0   0  1076  456 rpc_ex D    ?          0:00 df -h
(after killing the parent process so init would get it, in the hopes of
a successful reap... of course they're not zombie'd so that was useless :)
the 2.2.11-ac3 hang was intentional ifdown'ing the ethernet on an NFS
server... the hang stayed there for 30 minutes until I ifup'd the
NFS server and the df's went away...
