I see "hda interrupt lost" messages when I boot with "nosmp", these
messages never appear with io apic enabled.
Gigabyte-BXD board, new bios, not overclocked.
I checked the i8259/io_apic source:
1) why do we use 0x30 for the INVALIDATE_TLB_INTERRUPT?
The interrupt is extremely time critical [another cpu waits for
completion], and very short.
Shouldn't we use an interrupt with the highest io apic priority?
[0xF0..0xFF]?
2) what's the correct order for the ACK's to both 8259A?
my reference book says
	first slave, then master 
the linux code says
	first master, then slave.
Any known bugs in the 8259 code?
