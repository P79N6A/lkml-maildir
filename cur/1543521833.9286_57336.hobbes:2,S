I just tried to upgrade from 2.2.13 to 2.2.14, but somehow now eth1 won't 
come up anymore...
in 2.2.13 it still comes up, but not in the new kernel, i used exactly the 
same config for both
i checked. The only 2 patches i applied are ide from hedrick, and raid from 
mingo. Those
shouldn't break anything, certainly not my network devices...
I have 2 network cards, both compiled into the kernel, and not as a module, 
and i'm giving the
append eth1 command in lilo. The driver is DECchip Tulip (dc21x4x) PCI support.
If u need anymore info plz email me, since i'm not on the mailing-list
If u can help, thx
Surge
