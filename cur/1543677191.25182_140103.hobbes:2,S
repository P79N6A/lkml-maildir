Hello, 
is it possible to use several logical terminals
(=tupels of monitor, keyboard and mouse) directly
connected to _one_ system? I mean there is no problem
to connect two keyboards, two mice and two graphic
cards/monitors...
But is there a possibility to group these to allow two
users work simultanously on the same machine without
having to go via serial console or network?
I just can't imagine that no one has thougt about this
before...
Regards, 
Terje
