If you a git pull on the slab-mm branch off my VM tree on kernel.org then
you got all you need. There will be an update in the next days though 
since some of the data you gave me already suggests a couple of ways that
things may be made better.

Well the current slab-mm tree already does order 4 and min_objects=60 
which is probably overkill. Next git push on slab-mm will reduce that
to the values you found to be sufficient.

We would have to do some experiments to see how cpu counts affect multiple 
benchmarks. If we can establish a consistent benefit from varying these
parameters based on processor count then we should do so. There is already
one example in mm/vmstat.c how this could be done.
