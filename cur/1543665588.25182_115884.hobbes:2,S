It _appears_ to be a valid test-case. I can reproduce this with 
2.5.64+combo and B2.  I can also influence it to behave.  (that doesn't 
mean that the scheduler changes are bust... could be that the test-case is 
doing something bad)
Q/indicator:  do you ever see ksoftirqd _wanting_ to run?  (set top SCHED_RR)
