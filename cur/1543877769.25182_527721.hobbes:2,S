We do, along with libusbhid from *BSD to handle report descriptor 
parsing and report field extraction/insertion.

I pulled down 2.6.21-rc5-mm4 and took a look at hidraw. I like the 
simplicity of it for sure. One feature that seems to be missing is the 
ability to force an input report to be fetched via a control transfer. 
Several APC UPSes have the unfortunate tendency to change report values 
without sending an interrupt report to notify you, so you have to poll 
them occasionally. Also, how does one fetch string descriptors via 
hidraw?

I have to admit I don't see much value in switching Apcupsd to hidraw 
rather than libusb. (I see lots of value switching it away from hiddev, 
though :) We need a HID engine in userspace to handle descriptor parsing 
with any non-hiddev solution. Plus, APC UPSes tend to have buggy HID 
implementations that require a bit of care to communicate with properly. 
Having an "intelligent" kernel layer in the middle tends to just get in 
the way (see the truncated report handling patch for hid-core I just 
sent).
But honestly, the deal-breaker is that with libusb I can hit Linux, all 
the *BSDs, Darwin, Solaris, and even Windows with a single userspace 
driver. That's just too valuable to ignore.
