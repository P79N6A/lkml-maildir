you have to build another kernel for them. irqs-off and preempt-off
timing can be mixed freely (and both can be enabled in the same kernel),
but wakeup timing deserves its own .config space and since it's not
mixable with the other two methods i didnt see much point in enabling
all 3 at once with strange dependencies between them. Is this a big
issue? Normally i think the wakeup timing is more than enough to get a
feel of latencies, and if something specific is suspected the other ones
can be turned on.
