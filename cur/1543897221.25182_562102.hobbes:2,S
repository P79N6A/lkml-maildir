Please reread mails of the last 20 hours.  Your "ARM fix" may or may not
be a good thing, I don't know.  But it had nothing to do with this oops,
which (we believe) came from a kmalloc in drivers/mmc/core/sd.c.  There
are likely to be many other drivers which pass down kmalloc'ed buffers
to routines which handle both kmalloc'ed buffers and page buffers.
Though very few of those needing to flush_dcache_page.
