This patch adds lots of weird and inexplicable single- and double-newlines
in inappropriate places.  However it frequently forgets to add newlines
between end-of-locals and start-of-code, which is usual practice.
+struct list_blocks_struct {
+	ext4_lblk_t first_block, last_block;
+	ext4_fsblk_t first_pblock, last_pblock;
+};
	
This structure would benefit from some code comments.
