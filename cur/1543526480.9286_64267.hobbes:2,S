While mounted?  No.  Root has access to the entire machine and
everything running on it.  While unmounted?  Easy, since the user
would have to enter the key to unlock the volume.
Using capabilities, one could set up a restricted "sort-of-root"
account for which it may be feasible, but for the "real" root who can
install kernel modules and read /dev/mem, /dev/kmem and /proc/kcore
there is no hope.
