You can download module-init-tools at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/module-init-tools/
 or
most any Linux kernel mirror (see kernel.org for mirrors and other
general Linux information).
I don't really know of any good information sites for
module-init-tools. There should be a README in the source package.
Some simple web searches should produce decent information, or at
least a starting point.
