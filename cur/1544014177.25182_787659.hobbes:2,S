This error is similar to one reported by Kevin here.
http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0901.0/00970.html
[  111.775378] X:5010 map pfn expected mapping type write-back for d0000000-d0101000, got write-combining
[  111.775456] X:5010 freeing invalid memtype d0000000-d0101000
The sequence seems to be somewhat like this
- Kernel driver sets the whole graphics region to uc-minus or write-combining
- There is a remap_pfn_range() to map a portion of this region to user with "write-back" mapping.
Now there may be a MTRR for this region or there may be none. It will depend on specific system and
whether there were available MTRRs or MTRR setting was possible at all.If there are no MTRR settings,
then we have caught a valid aliasing here.
I have reproduced this problem on a local system here and looking for a sane solution....
Thanks,
