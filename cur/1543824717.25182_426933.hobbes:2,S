Sounds like this is due to df5b89b323b922f56650b4b4d7c41899b937cf19, aka 
"md: Convert reconfig_sem to reconfig_mutex" by NeilBrown.
Neil? It may well be (and likely is) an old thing, just exposed by the 
lock debugging of the new mutexes.
Was it _meant_ to take the lock and hold it? Looks like it might be the
	ITERATE_MDDEV(mddev,tmp)
		if (mddev_trylock(mddev))
			do_md_stop (mddev, 1);
(maybe it should release the lock after the md_stop?)
