XFree86 3.something - run remotely over PPP so version shouldn't matter.
Netscape 4.5-US run locally.
In console, 'DISPLAY=remote:0 strace netscape' must be done as root for
reboot.
I tried it in an Xterm yesterday and succeeded as a normal user and X was
running locally that time.
Quick question, are you SMP? Mine is...
Last thing I could log from strace was it reading /root/.Xdefaults.  less
works just fine on it...
