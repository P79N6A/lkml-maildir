There was, for a while, bogus 2.5.45 tar-balls etc created from a BK tree
that was never meant to be exported (translation: "Linus ran his automatic
release-scripts on a bad tree because he is a booger-head").
I've removed the offending files, and hopefully nobody even had time to
download them, but just in case - if you get your kernels as tar-balls (or 
as old-fashioned patches) rather than from the BK tree, and you saw a 
2.5.45, you should ignore it.
