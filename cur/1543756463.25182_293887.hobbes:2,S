Please *think* before saying this.  It's not always the case.  Firewire
support in 2.6 kernel has been less than stellar, for one example.  And
yes, for many, solid 1394 support is a requirement for business.
(And we've all seen the testing that has shown both sides (2.4, 2.6)
have been faster)

Not sure....on 13 January 2005 Alan Cox posted "Given that base 2.6
kernels are shipped by Linus with known unfixed
security holes anyone trying to use them really should be doing some
careful thinking. In truth no 2.6 released kernel is suitable for
anything but beta testing until you add a few patches anyway."
How do you answer this, when telling folks "everyone should upgrade
whenever appropriate."?
Just some random thoughts....from a 2.4 supporter :)
