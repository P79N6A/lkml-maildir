Just one of my machines to 2.6.22.1, and got this during boot..
Starting udev: udevd-event[619]: udev_node_symlink: symlink(../../sdc/dev/disk/by-uuid/2d773baf-8174-10a6-14db-a78e0e676e89) failed: File exists
Under 2.6.21, all was fine.
sdc is one disk of a 3 disk raid5 set.
The raidset still manages to come up despite this.
This is a Fedora 7 box, with udev-106-4.1.fc7
What changed this time?
	Dave
