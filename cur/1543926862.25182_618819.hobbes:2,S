The ability to provide alternative access control schemes is the
purpose of LSM. The fact that we insane security people can't come
to the agreement you require is why we have LSM. You can not have
what you are asking for. Please suggest an alternative design.

Yup. No one ever said security was cheap. Most real, serious security
solutions implemented today rely on separate physical machines for
isolation. Some progressive installations are using virtualization,
and the lunatic fringe uses the sort of systems well served by LSM.
Let's face it, people who really care are willing to pay a premium.

File access control is within the scope of the LSM. If your feature
can't deal with that you need to fix your feature.

Sounds like a conflict in requirements.

I would be perfectly happy without containers, just as I understand
you don't give a rat's pitute about LSMs. If you want my cooperation
and/or backing on containers, show me how they make my life better,
and how cutting up LSM is to my advantage. I am perfectly willing
to consider alternatives, but I confess that my natural reaction to
confrontation is to fight back.
