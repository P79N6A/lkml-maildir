Subject: [PATCH 000 of 9] knfsd: Introduction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Following are 9 patches for knfsd in 2.6-18-rc1-mm2
They should be held for 2.6.19.
They comprise
 3 trivial cleanups from Greg Banks
 Some fixes/cleanups to socket/version selection code.
 Adding a 'portlist' file to the 'nfsd' filesystem.
  This can be used to open and close sockets used by the nfs server.
  New sockets are created in user-space and passed down by writing
   an 'fd' number.
  Old sockets are closed by finding the appropriate name in 'portlist'
  and writing it back to 'portlist' preceded by a '-'.
nfs-utils-1.0.9 can work with 'portlist' to e.g. control which
protocol (udp or tcp) is used.  However it has other problems:
 rpc.nfsd 0
will no longer stop all nfsd threads.  So there will be a 1.0.10 shortly.
