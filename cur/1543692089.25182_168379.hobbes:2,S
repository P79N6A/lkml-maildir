Personally I fail to see the problem with this.  BK must be (I assume) a
useful tool to someone, or it wouldn't exist.

I've only been following LKML for about 4 months, and this must be the 5th
or
6th time I've seen someone post an email with this jist to it.  If it only
took a month or two, I am sure someone would have posted an announcement
about their new tool in the time I've been on the list.
