Have you looked at the code the C compiler for the 56000 or 56100 families
produce? The 56000 has split memories, which the compiler isn't too happy with.
Neither architecture has an orthogonal general purpose instruction set, because
that's not what DSPs are made for. The bottom line is large, slow code that's of
limited practical value. As you said, the C compiler doesn't understand how to
make use of the special DSP qualities of these chips. Since its those very
qualities you are normally using the chip for the, using C makes limited sense.
Now, if you are trying to use a 56K part as a general purpose processor you are
really on to a looser. When I was at Motorola considerable effort was spent trying
to graft more general purpose functionality onto these architectures, so they
could function without a support microcontroller. They failed. Its like mixing oil
and water.

The TI C3x and C4x are a bit more general purpose on the floating point side, but
the integer section of these chips is still very much a DSP addressing support
unit. The Sharc has considerable similarities. Their C compilers only produce
reasonable code in limited contexts. The clumsy code generation would probably
expand the minimum 2M requirement for Linux by a factor of several, and the result
would be _slow_. Think what a simple bit mask and test turns into on most DSP
chips. OK, some newer chips have fixed that, but how do you get around all
calculations being performed with the same register length? How to do overcome
everything being word aligned? How do you get around the limited, but highly
customised, addressing schemes? Even if the C compiler generated reasonable DSP
like code, it could do nothing to make a compilation of Linux look sane.

An MMU is not a core requirement. Security suffers badly without one, but there
are already embedded Linux projects for Linux, where people are prepared to accept
these limitations. For embedded use it may often be OK.

I could port Linux to an 8 bit microcontroller. It would take some hardware
support to do masses of memory bank switching, to extend the chip's addressing
capabilities, and it would run like molasses doesn't. Is it doable? Yes. Does it
make any sense? No.

Some of the latest DSP families, like the TI 6000 are turning the whole compiler
thing around. They have made an architecture that's so hard to program in assembly
language they have bet the future on highly customised compiler technology. I
believe TI bought one of the smaller companies working on compilers for EPIC, and
used their C compiler as the basis for the 6000's programming environment. They
have made sure the architecture and the compiler fit together, and work well - so
long as you use a particular subset/style of C. I believe the TigerSharc is
similar. These things are priced higher than a Celeron, but less than a Pentium
II, and are capable of some pretty hot performance. They still don't have what it
takes to run Linux well, though.
