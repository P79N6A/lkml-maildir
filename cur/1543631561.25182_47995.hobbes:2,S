Hi!
The "svgalib" has a tool named "reset_vga". It completely resets your
VGA-card . You may try it... but it's only a workaround at the cause and 
not at the symptom.
I used it a longer time ago with a similar problem (only slightly 
similar - programmed the VGA-card "by hand", and needed to clear the 
scrambled output I produced :-) ).
