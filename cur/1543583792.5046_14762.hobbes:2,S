	The problem was simply, that I couldn't  cd to a directory.
"File exist, but couldn't be stat-ed" or something similar was the
message.
	Now I think, that it was my fault. I think, I forgot to compile
one of the charsets into the kernel, and this dir had strange filenames.
I haven't had time to check it thou.

On glibc-2.2.2 		header files of select changed. So it does not
compile cleanly. If I remember well, a define called number_of_open or
similar was also missing. I am not sure in it thou. It might have been
some other program.
