Ingo,
I think the disconnect for you here is that you assume the Linux world
will remain constant and that everything must look like unix to be
good.  In NetWare, susbsytems that are user space in Linux are in-kernel
in NetWare for speed.  NDS is a good example. NCP is another, routing is
another.  I am moving this stuff in-kernel to replicate NetWare's
performance -- debugging an in-kernel NDS with "code reviews" will take
forever.  Just because Linux puts everything in user space does not mean
that's how the whole world should be.   There's a lot of kernel
development I'm sure folks want to do with Linux they cannot because it
too tough to debug.  SMP problems I've run into on Linux with just take
too long without these types of tools.  THis is  simple issue.  I told
Darren Major, Drew Major's brother, folks comments this morning against
a kernel debugger in Linux -- he shook his head and said "how stupid can
they be?"  Enough said.
