You could load all those modules one at a time, doing a `cat /proc/ioports'
after each one.  One sneaky way of doing that would be to make your
modprobe executable be:
	#!/bin/sh
	echo Loading $* > /dev/console
	modprobe.orig $*
	cat /proc/ioports > /dev/null
	echo that worked
and then just boot in the normal manner.
Have you ever unloaded a module?  The usual source of this crash is some
driver forgot to unregister an IO region during module unload.  So a read
of /proc/ioports crashes _after_ the module is rmmodded.
