I was expecting it to be an error, but I'm not upset that it's not. Just
kind of weird to see five mounts with the exact same information in
/etc/mtab.
I can see why it would be useful to have multiple things mounted on the same
mountpoint, but is there any reason to allow the _same_ filesystem to be
mounted multiple times at the same mountpoint?
