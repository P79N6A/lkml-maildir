I don't know about the branding people, but suspend-to-ram and radeonfb
shouldn't be a problem for fbsplash :)

As far as I know: SuSE uses bootsplash, Gentoo and PLD use fbsplash,
RedHat uses rhgb (100% userspace solution, based on xvesa, doesn't
provide graphical backgrounds on vt's - for that a kernel patch like
bootsplash or fbsplash is necessary). I don't know about Debian - they
probably have some (possibly unofficial) support for both bootsplash
and fbsplash.
Live long and prosper.
