For the kernel itself, I think that building a directory at once is the
way forward. For modules, obviously the scope is more limited.
Either way, I'd like to prevent the unnecessary proliferation of
__global by instrument the link process somehow so that we get a
_warning_ during the final link if there are any global symbols which
aren't actually used. Having said that, --gc-sections will happily drop
them from the vmlinux anyway so I'm not _overly_ concerned by it.
In fact, I think binutils got patched recently so that it can _tell_ us
what sections got dropped by --gc-sections, which would do the job
nicely.
