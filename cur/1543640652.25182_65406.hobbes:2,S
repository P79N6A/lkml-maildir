Comments in general.
It touches user space with spinlocks held -> bad idea
It doesnt check copy_*_user returns instead commenting that some other
driver didnt so it wont - bad idea too
It seems to be allocating a major - can you have > 1 ipmi per host, can
it use misc devices, can it get one registered properly with lanana
Otherwise its way way way nicer than the hideous thing a certain chip
vendor sent me.
