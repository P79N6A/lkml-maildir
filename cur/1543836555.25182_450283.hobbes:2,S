No, the low-level interface between the kernel is an ABI, which will be 
as stable as your hypervisor author/vendor wants it to be (which is 
generally "very stable").  The question is whether that low-level 
interface is exposed to the rest of the kernel directly, or hidden 
behind a kernel-internal source-level API.
