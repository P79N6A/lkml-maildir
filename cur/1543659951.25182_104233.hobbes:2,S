Dave has given us a speech in Mallorca. He explained the new features, 
main changes and details how Linus, Alan, Marcelo Tossatti or Rusty 
Russell deals with the development (and Bitkeeper's advantages :-).
It was really interesting. The audio file are available from

Thanks Dave. Hope to see Victoria and again.
