Good, I'm glad I'm not just making things up ;)
The gist of the patch is to convert all the kernel virtual addresses 
into struct page+offset.  It's a fairly generic way to handle highmem 
systems, so it should work for you too.  Of course, if you have a 
cleaner patch to achieve the same result, then we evaluate that too.
