thanks for your input.  so read*() and write*() family should _only_
be used for pci bus?
the "Understanding the linux kernel" state that those macro should be
used for i/o shared memory.  and it has three bus listed: isa, vlb,
pci.
I'm a bit confused... i know some arch have bus-dedicated read and
write macro, ie isa_readl().  is this the way to go?
sorry for dumb questions.  if this is RTFM thing, just tell me.
thanks,
