Here you are:
http://code.google.com/p/zumastor/source/browse/www/lvm3/bio.single.alloc-2.6.24.3
http://code.google.com/p/zumastor/source/browse/www/lvm3/bio.hide.endio-2.6.24.3
http://code.google.com/p/zumastor/source/browse/www/lvm3/bio.stack-2.6.24.3
http://code.google.com/p/zumastor/source/browse/www/lvm3/dm.reduce.allocs-2.6.24.3
This compiles and boots for me, though I only tried device mapper
under UML, and then only lightly.  It would be nice to see some reports
on the stability on this, one way or the other.  Next move is to clean
up __clone_and_map the rest of the way.
Thanks for your merge.  Not easy, hmm?  The mainline bio changes
generated a bunch of tracking work, but they are sensible changes so
no regrets (the bogus endio bytes parameter and int return are gone).
Now... it appears to me that bi_size is an entirely redundant field,
so while we are turfing bio junk out...
Regards,
Daniel
