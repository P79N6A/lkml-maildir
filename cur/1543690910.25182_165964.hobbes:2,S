Andre,
You seem to be mixing two forms of "use"; the right to use GPL'd source
and the right to use an operational Linux kernel.    
You are free to take the source and do whatever you want with it, restricted
only by the terms of the GPL.  Other people have the right to do the same.
There is nothing in the GPL that says how a program must behave when 
_executing_.  Therefore, if you don't like how the resulting executable 
operates, _tough_.   Your option, and the _freedom_ provided by the GPL, 
is to fork the source. 
No different than a kernel provided by the Church of Holy Computation 
which refuses to operate on Sunday.   You may disagree with the 
restriction, but surely they are free to add such a restriction to their
kernel source.
As it stands, you are complaining about a _runtime_ restriction;  ignoring 
your ability to change the source.   By insisting that other people remove 
checks for license type, you are trying to restrict  what others do with 
_their_ source.  By design, the kernel is already full of runtime restrictions. 
There is nothing special about a runtime limitation imposed on modules 
lacking the GPL symbol.   Just to drive the point home,  please consider that there is nothing wrong with a kernel that refuses 
to load modules that _DO_ contain the GPL symbol.
In short, fork off...
Sean
