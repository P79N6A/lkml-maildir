No, I think we catch 70-85%.  Namesys internal bad patches frequently 
pass original testing of patch author and are caught by professional 
tester whose specialty is testing reiserfs patches.  You just haven't 
seen these bad patches, so you don't realize how effective the catching 
is.;-)  There have been a lot of catches.;-)  It is not simply a matter 
of skill in testing though: you need a second person to test it in the 
way that the author did not think to test it (e.g. by booting to the 
right kernel, everyone on this list has made that benchmarking/testing 
error a few times, yes....;-) ).
