Your scripts(?) to generate these things are a bit strange, since they
leave an extra empty line in the commit message, which confuses at least
gitweb (ie just look at
   
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/perex/alsa.git;a=summary
and note how the summary thing looks empty).
Now, arguably gitweb should ignore whitespace at the beginning, but 
equally arguably your commits shouldn't have them either...
