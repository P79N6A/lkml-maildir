Hi,
I am using a rtl8029 PCI ethernet card. The driver works fine, the netcard is detected, but when ifconfig is executed on eth0, the system locks up. I had used a ne2k-isa (ne) netcard before, and it worked just fine. But I can't stick back to this card, and I want to know if there is something known about this crash.
I cannot append my settings, as I have no connection from the server to anywhere else. The most important things:
K6-II 400, 100 MHz BUS, 384 MB of RAM, 13.6 GB harddisk, Voodoo II Banshee card, SB Live! Full, RTL8029 NIC, IPv4, IPv6, PCI access mode: any
Anything more to be known?
Thunder
