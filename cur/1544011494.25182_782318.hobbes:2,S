I'm running gentoo, udev 124-r1
I cleared all superblocks on all devices I raided, and undid all the
partition tables, and started from scratch, putting the filesystem on
the raid devices themselves instead of partitioning the raid devices.
Everything is working now, I think it's probably best to keep it
simple, or use LVM
MD is referenced in the udev config files, but everything is working now.
Sorry, I think it was user error. :)
Thanks
Dylan
