Well, I could set it to the &init_struct_pid as you said, but it will not 
change any of the code below it. So it does not matter what 
ftrace_swapper_pid is set to, as long as it is not set to something that 
can be a legitimate pid struct for something not the swapper task.
It will only matter when we fix the fork code.

Well, the swapper task should still have a pid of zero. That is probably 
important.
