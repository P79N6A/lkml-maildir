Hi John,
First, always CC Ingo on all issues related to the -rt patch.  Although
I think he's on vacation now, but even so, he will probably miss this
email.

What was the last release that it worked on?  If you could try older
releases, that would really help to know when the problem occurred.
Lots of things have gone on recently since -rt1 and it would help if we
can pin point when this happened, so we would have a good idea of what
happened.

Do you have a serial output? Or compile your network driver into the
kernel and turn on netconsole.  Usually when someone says "before any
logging", I think of before there's output to the screen. But your next
statements seems to show that that is not the case.

This may just be a 64bit issue as well somewhere.
