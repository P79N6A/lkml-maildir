In theory its separated, but X servers do are complex things. I don't know
whether you ever read X server code, but I did.

Right! Finally we're getting at the same wavelength :-)
But for the 3.x line, XFree86 has many different accelerated X servers, each
with their own screen init functions. The current accelerated XF68_FBDev is
experimental, and we did it the way we did because that was the only way it
made sense to us (at that time, 4.x is not finished). Don't forget that the
`normal' XFree86 doesn't have any acceleration support for the NCR77C32BLT nor
for the IMS Twin Turbo. We borrowed XFree86 accel code for the ATI Mach64 only.
For the 4.x line, things can and should be done The Right Way (I hope).
