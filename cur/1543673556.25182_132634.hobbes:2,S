    SYNOPSIS:
Receiving a compiler error when attempting to include asm/uacccess.h
    DESCRIPTION:
I am compiling a program that is written in C++ so the g++ compiler is
being used to compile the source. On of the headers of a dependent
library is including asm/uaccess.h. When I attempt to compile this
program I get parse errors.

    REPEAT BY:
Here a test programs that I did:
#include <asm/uaccess.h>
int main (){
	return 0;
}
    SAMPLE FIX/WORKAROUND:
None.
