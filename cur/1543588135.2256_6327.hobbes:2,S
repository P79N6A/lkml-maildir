Hello!
I've compiled 2.4.3-ac9 with support for PNP BIOS. I understand that this
is a new feature experimental and the feedback is requested.
The setting is BIOS is to use irq 7 and dma 3. I normally use "options
parport_pc io=0x378 irq=7 dma=3" in /etc/modules.conf, but this time I
commented them out hoping that the driver will ask BIOS.
Although the kernel can see those settings, the dma is not used by the
driver. This is the output from dmesg.
PnPBIOS: Parport found PNPBIOS PNP0401 at io=0378,0778 irq=7 dma=-1
0x378: FIFO is 16 bytes
