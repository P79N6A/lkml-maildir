> anybody know the record uptime for 1 machine running Linux?

 4:38pm  up 62 days, 19:01,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
doesnt sound a lot does it - except for one thing, that machine has been
around its 490+ day timer wrap, and then on for 62 days. (Prior to that lot
it was on about 440 days when it was turned off for UPS maintenance)
It sits in a machine room with proper ventiliation attached to a wardrobe
sized UPS and running DNS and until recently also dialup ports.
