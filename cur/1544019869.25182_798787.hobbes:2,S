Wish we'd have piped up earlier to save you a bit of work.

We can make the NUMAQ's beep still, if not boot.  :)
Reality is they're just not worth the effort any more and there's no
sign of anybody else having them.  Assuming your code goes in for
2.6.30 it'll be easy to drop NUMAQ support.  Even if there's not much
downside there's also not much reason to leave it in but marked
deprecated/broken.
