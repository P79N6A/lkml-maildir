Very true. Linux is best defined by those who proactively implement
powerful ideas.
That doesn't mean, however, that the folks in Redmond can't come up with
an interesting and useful idea that we might just want to consider.

Any database-style file system should be implemented in a modular
fashion, just like current Linux file systems.
Microsoft's penchant for integrating everything is their greatest
weakness (in terms of security) as well as their greatest strength (in
terms of customer lock-in). Since we don't care about locking anyone
into anything, we don't have those nasty marketing droids forcing us to
make poor technical choices.

Agreed -- but we might want pay attention, in case skinning cats has
some actual value.

MySQL wouldn't need to be shoved into the kernel; a small, fast database 
engine (one of my professional specialities, BTW) could provide metadata 
services in a file system module. SQL is a bloated pig; an effective 
file system needs to be both useful and efficient, leading me to think 
that we should consider a more succinct query mechanism for any 
metadata-based file system.
