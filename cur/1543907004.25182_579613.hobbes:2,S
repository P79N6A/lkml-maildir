Subject: [PATCH] Fix /proc/pid/pagemap return length calculation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

/proc/pid/pagemap has a header (usually 8 bytes) the length
of which needs to be compensated for when converting from
proc file offset to page number.  The calculation of the
starting page number (svpfn) compensates for this, but the
calculation of the ending page number (evpfn) does not, resulting
in reads returning 8 bytes more than were asked for and
nastily overwriting userspace memory.
