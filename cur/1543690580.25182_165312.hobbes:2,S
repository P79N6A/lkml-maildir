Yes, I see this too, but very infrequently.
For the 2.6 kernels key repeat is not taken from the keyboard but is
done via a kernel timer, and clearly the code is not quite correct.
I have not yet been able to detect it before I already
had hit the next key but maybe somebody else can answer:
When does this repeat stop?
Does it stop because the next key has been hit?
And: does it occur more often when the machine has high load?
