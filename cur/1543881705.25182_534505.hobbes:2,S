Yes.  It was originally smaller patches, which I tried to keep in a
state where everything was incrementally buildable, but it got too hard
to keep it all together.
I guess I can break it down into functional groups, and put the config
stuff at the end.

Yes, I can drop it.  It's not needed in this kernel.

Because it doesn't care whether they're set or not.  I'm suppressing
them here to prevent the kernel from trying to use these features.  I
suppress ACC in particular to stop the P4 thermal interrupt code from
trying to do anything.
I'll comment it.

They aren't.  They're only for VMI.  I've only got them to make sure
that there are no stray APIC usages.

Won't preempt_disable disappear as well?  I don't need the CPU number.

No, there's a one instruction preempt window there.  If I do:
    mov %fs:xen_vcpu, %eax
    movb $1,1(%eax)
and a preempt happens in between, then the interrupt will be disabled on
the wrong cpu.
Once we can put the vcpu structure into the percpu area directly, then I
can do:
    movb $1,%fs:xen_vcpu+1
which is preempt-safe, of course.

I don't follow you.

I fix this up in the xen-machine-ops.patch.

I'll make it more explicit.  It's 64k of GDT entries == 16 pages.

I think 256 idt entries is OK, but it should be (desc->size+1) / 8.

Nobody at the moment.  I don't think there's much need for it in an
unprivileged Xen domU.  I could just nop it out for now.

It would probably present xen-3 guests a xen-3 signature.

0 is the version number.  I don't think there are symbols for the
bootloader types.

That's the !PAE case, so we expect to never have any PMD calls.  The
hooks exist for !PAE because I didn't want to have more ifdefs.
