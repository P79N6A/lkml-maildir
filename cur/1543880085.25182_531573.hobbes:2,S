Hi Randi,
I'm pretty sure the reason you cannot reproduce this warning is the line 
<xsl:param name="refentry.version.suppress">1</xsl:param>
which can be found in param.xsl, it being a part of the docbook-xsl
distribution. The parameter's name is self-explanatory and a '1' suppresses
the version generation. I was able to get this error because in the
debian docbook-xsl package this param value is set to 0 by default.
This means, some users will get this warning and some will not, depending on the
setting in the param.xsl file. What is the way to go here wrt to a solution
dealing with all cases:
1. patch the kernel-doc?
2. issue an info so that the user can suppress the annoying warning by
themselves?
3. ...?
