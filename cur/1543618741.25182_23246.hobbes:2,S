Hello,
I get the following message under 2.2.19:
Message from syslogd@diehard at Thu Jan 24 14:44:49 2002 ...
diehard kernel: CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004
and the box is dead.
Can anybody please enlighten me what this means or what a possible
problem behind might be?
Thank you in advance
Stephan
