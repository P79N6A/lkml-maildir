In the US, 17 USC 101 (the "Definitions" section of the title dealing
with Copyright) makes this definition:
    A "computer program" is a set of statements or instructions to be
    used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about
    a certain result.
As its purpose is to outline the scope of copyright law, this
definition is made under the authority granted to Congress by Article
I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution.
