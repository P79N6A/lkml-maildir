:-) I'm not going to argue this. You could definitely save a few 
instructions if you had fewer priorities and it probably wouldn't be 
very hard to create a patch to do this.

All of the RT priorities that we have are not absolutely necessary. As I 
think Steven pointed out in another email, it is nice though to be able 
to priortize tasks using large jumps in priorities and then being able 
to fill in tasks that are dependent on other tasks in between. Even if 
you think of nothing but the IRQ handlers, the 5-10 priorities quickly 
get crowded without any user tasks.
