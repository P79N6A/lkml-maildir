Hi! This is the ezmlm program. I'm managing the
startrek@trekker.com mailing list.
Acknowledgment: I have added the address
   linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu
to the startrek mailing list.
Welcome to startrek@trekker.com!
Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.
--- Here are the ezmlm command addresses.
I can handle administrative requests automatically.
Just send an empty note to any of these addresses:
   <startrek-subscribe@trekker.com>:
   Receive future messages sent to the trekker.com-startrek mailing list.
   <startrek-unsubscribe@trekker.com>:
   Stop receiving messages for the trekker.com-startrek mailing list.
DO NOT SEND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUESTS TO THE MAILING LIST!
If you do, I won't see them, and subscribers will yell at you.
To specify God@heaven.af.mil as your subscription address, send mail
to <startrek-subscribe-God=heaven.af.mil@trekker.com>.
I'll send a confirmation message to that address; when you receive that
message, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.
--- Enclosed is a copy of the request I received.
