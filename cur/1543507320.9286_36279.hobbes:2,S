Does this apply even if they aren't "for" crypto, but just happen to be
good places for crypto code to latch on to?  How is it decided?  I mean,
couldn't a call to main() be considered a crypto hook?
what if it's just named frobnostigate_data? even if it has to be
considered a "debugging" hook, and a function written to strobe the caps
lock indicator each time it's called, to give it semblance of
legitimacy...  then, two weeks later someone "notices" the potential and
releases a crypto module...
