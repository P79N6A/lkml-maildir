Argh. This is all depending on a special gcc option to compile the 
kernel and that option limits the kernel to the upper 2GB. So I guess for 
CPU_PTR we need to explicitly load the address as a constant, use that as 
a base and then add the offset and the smp_id shifted to it in the 
instruction. The CPU_INC/DEC stuff using gs is not affected.
