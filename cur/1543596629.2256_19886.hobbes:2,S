I posted a patch for this a few hours after 2.4.6-ac1 became available, but
there have been problems with lkml archive servers in the interim, so here
is my patch again.  If you look in drivers/parport/parport_pc.c, you'll see that
the new code is bracketed by:
#if defined (CONFIG_PNPBIOS) || defined (CONFIG_PNPBIOS_MODULE)
	new stuff for 2.4.6-ac1
#endif
