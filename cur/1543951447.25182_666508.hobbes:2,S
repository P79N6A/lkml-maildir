As Eric said kexec need only to allocate memory during loading, not
executing.

I think this can be avoid such as preallocate some hard disk space (such
as a dedicate hibernating file, the block list are loaded by
kexec-tools).

ACPI is the biggest challenge for kexec based hibernation. I will try to
deal with it. But for most people, ACPI is not a big issue. This is
hibernation, not suspend to RAM.

No, the newest implementation need not to boot a different kernel or
different bootloader entry. You just use one bootloader entry, it will
resume if there's an image, booting normally if there's not. You can
look at the newest hibernation example description.
And the new method can even be used to load hibernation image of uswsusp
too.
