The idea of a low-watermark mark interrupt is that there are *zero*
interrupts, as long as the kernel keeps feeding packets to the device.
In my last email to you, I attached a real-life vmstat trace 
showing exactly zero interrupts over a two minute period. 
However, the zero-interrupt scenario only occurs if the kernel
is actually feeding packets to the driver.  If the socket beffers
are small, then the app blocks, the kernel is idle, and there
are not enough tcp ack packets coming back the other way to 
actually get the NAPI polling to keep the adapter fed.

And, for a lark, this is exactly what I did. Just to see.
Because there are so few ack packets, there are very few 
RX interrupts -- not enough to get NAPI to actually keep
the device busy.

I'm somewhat disoriened from this conversation. Its presumably
clear that low-watermark mechanisms are superior to NAPI. 
From what I gather, NAPI was invented to deal with cheap 
or low-function hardware; it adds nothing to this particular
situation. Why are we talking about this?
