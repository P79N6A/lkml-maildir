Hi All,
From my customized system call, I merely call call_usermodehelper() to spawn
a process. When I call my_system_call around 1000 times in order to spawn
'hello world' program, I noticed in 'top' program that system has lost 200
KB of free memory.
I just increased the iteration to 700000, I lost the entire 128 MB free
memory from my system and eventually the system is freezed.
Any suggestion or patch to over come this issue ?
Please 'cc' me in your reply.
Thanks & Regards,
Srikumar.
