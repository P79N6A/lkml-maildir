I would be highly surprised if it was.

Well, I have volunteered to Linus to make sure that some kind of
*complete* patch gets in, so presumably it will happen :)  I, of course,
am completely happy not to do the work, so feel free to send me patches.
However, this is probably how you want to do the semantics for now:
If the size < 0xffff0
	old_field := (size+15) >> 4
	new_field := size
else
	old_field := 0xffff
	new_field := size
... and look at the new_field only if the old_field is 0xffff; that was
we maximize compatibility.
Not that I think it matters much.
