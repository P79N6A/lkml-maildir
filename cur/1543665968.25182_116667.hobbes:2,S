Well, the first version of /dev/epoll was truly ET and it wasn't using
poll kernel hooks. With the usage of poll hook it became more affordable
to consider to have both ET and LT behaviours. ET would be my pick if I
have to start a new application from scratch anyway.

The patch I posted yesterday does the per-fd selectable ET/LT behaviour.
It ran fine on UP and 2SMP tonight, so I'm going to ping Linus for a merge
later today.
