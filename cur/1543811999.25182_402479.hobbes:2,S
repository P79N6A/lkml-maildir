With the latest git, on a testbox here, we're seeing this..
  slab size-512: redzone mismatch in slab f7d74040, obj f7d74078, bufctl 0xfffffffe
  Redzone: 0x170fc2a5/0x170fc200.

  010: 43 70 75 30 49 73 74 00 00 30 00 00 49 4e 54 4c
over and over just after booting.
Translating that to ascii, it looks like..

 Sometimes I feel I'm the only person who sees these.)
