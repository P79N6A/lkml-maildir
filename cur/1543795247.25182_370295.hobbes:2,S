Error 4 means a read in userland on a not mapped area.
The above isn't necessairly a kernel or hardware problem, it looks like
an userland bug if it segfaults at such a low address (20f31). Nothig is
mapped below "0x400000" exactly to catch these kind of bugs. 
You should debug the program and check what's the code at address
0x4035ae? You can check it with gdb or objdump -d. Probably there's a
64bit bug in the program that doesn't trigger on x86 32bit (or you may
not be noticing the segfault on 32bits because it wouldn't be logged in
the syslog).
Hope this helps ;)
