Subject: 2.5.70-bk[56] breaks disk partitioning with multiple IDE disks

	Disk partition under linux-2.5.70-bk[56] systems with two
IDE disks is broken.  Under these kernels, the first disk gets
the partitioning of the second disk.  Reverting drivers/ide/ide.c
to the 2.5.70-bk4 version makes the problem go away.
	However, there were other changes made to ide.c that are
probably not related to this problem, and I haven't yet analyzed the
problem enough to suggest a potentially correct patch.
	Note that I use user-level disk partition table parsing via
partx from util-linux and run ide as a loadable module.  It is
possible that other configuations might not experience this problem.
