Hi Wolfram,
I had the same hardlock problem with dual athlons, MSI K7D Master, Promise
TX2000 (PDC20271) with 2 HDDs on RAID0 on the Promise card and only a CDROM
on the onboard IDE channel.
It used to lock hard (2.4.18 vanilla kernel) on 'tar' when using a USB mouse
but I haven't had a single lockup since plugging in a PS2 mouse :)
PS. Whilst 2.4 kernels run fine for me, I can't get any 2.5 kernel to run
yet.
I get a VFS kernel panic on bootup (can't mount root device).
I've installed Rusty's 2.5 modutils and tried compiling the 20271 driver
both into the kernel and as a module.
I read in Dave Jones' post-halloween notes that the Promise drivers are
broken:
<quote>
- The hptraid/promise RAID drivers are currently non functional, and
  will probably be converted to use device-mapper.

Is this still true?
Best Regards,
Chris Newland
