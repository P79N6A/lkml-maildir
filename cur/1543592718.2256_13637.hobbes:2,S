That is supposed to hapen.  The pages are existing both in swap and memory but
not recovered. In that state the VM hasn't even broken yet. 
Where you hit a problem is that the 255Mb of stuff both in memory and swap
won't be flushed from swap when you need more swap space. That is a giant size
special edition stupid design flaw that is on the VM hackers list. But there
are only a finite number of patches you can do in a day, and things like
sucking completely came first I believe
