Subject: IDE(?) lockups in 2.5.7pre1, 2.5.6, 2.5.6pre3

	Under 2.5.6-pre3 and 2.5.6, my desktop workstation would
occasionally get into a state where all disk I/O would block.
Process would run until they had to go to the disk, and then they
would stop.  Hitting ctrl-<scroll lock> shows these process in "D"
state.  The IDE controller in this machine is:
00:07.1 IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586 IDE [Apollo] (rev 06)
	I just built 2.5.7-pre1 and have discovered the other machne
that has a VIA IDE controller developed the same problem just after
printing its first "login: " prompt, although it did not have the problem
on a subsequent reboot.  This other machine did not lock up with
2.5.6-pre3 or 2.5.6, although that is probably just due to random
chance, as the problem was occurring only once a day.  The
IDE controller in this second machine is:
00:04.1 IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586 IDE [Apollo] (rev 10)
	I will try to track this down from the process stack traces
when it happens next, but I thought I ought to report it in the meantime.
