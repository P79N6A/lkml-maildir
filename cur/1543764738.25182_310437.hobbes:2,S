  When the parent tree renames a file, it's easier for an out-of-tree
  patch to get up-to-date.
- reviewing.
  A huge patch with 2000 added lines and 1990 removed lines is more
  difficult to review then a rename + 10 lines patch.

When you've got no out-of-tree patches since you've got the
parent-of-all-trees, then they don't matter, that's true :)
