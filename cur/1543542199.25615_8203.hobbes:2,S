You are correct.  I think what I was asking was how does an inode in the
vfs get invalidated if rename() asks the FS to remove a previously
exisiting file with the same name.  From what you describe, the inode
number will remain constant and the same inode will get re-used (with
the previous inode number -- yikes!).

File system "inode"-like records for NWFS consist of a single file
called the "Directory File" that is comprised of 128 byte records.  A
File consists of a root 128 byte record and can have up to six other
records chained from it (in a single linked chain) with each 128 byte
chained record holding a namespace record.  What I am using as the inode
number if the file relative position of the "root" (MS_DOS) namespace
record in the directory file.  These nubers are unique for a given
file.  If I rename a file or mv it, it is possible for a new set of
linked directory records to get created with a differnt "root" record
relative position.  I have been using these numbers as the inode
number.  Sounds like this was a bad idea?
