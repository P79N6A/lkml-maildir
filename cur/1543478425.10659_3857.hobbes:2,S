I get broadcast 129.13.255.255 with linux-2.2.0-pre7, net-tools 1.45 
thus ifconfig 1.33 (1998-03-02).

The behaviour is perfectly ok. 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 is class B
network which has a netmask of 255.255.0.0 and a broadcast of x.x.255.255.
Ifconfig automatically sets the official broadcast address. In case you
change the netmask it is up to you to change the broadcast, too, if
needed.
Use
 ifconfig eth0 129.13.242.6 broadcast 129.13.242.255 netmask 255.255.255.0
instead.
I think this question concerns net-tools.
