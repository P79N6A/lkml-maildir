Well, that patch is definitely broken.
You say that it just causes a warning about sleeping in interrupt context, 
while I say that the warning is a serious error. If that semaphore _ever_ 
is write-locked, the whole machine will crash from trying to sleep when it 
cannot sleep.
So I can certainly undo the undo, but the fact is, the code is CRAP. I'd 
much rather get a real fix instead of having to select between two known 
bugs.
Please?
