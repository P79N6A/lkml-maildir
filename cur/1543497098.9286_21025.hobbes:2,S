I'm presuming you're referring to Zip disks?
I'm not sure what your problem is, but I have no problem reading disks
formatted on either my friend Mike's Zip-100 (uses the PPA driver) on
my Zip-250 (uses the IMM driver), and he has no problem reading 100M
disks formatted on my drive on his, so this isn't a kernel problem.
Mike's used his drive with all stable kernels since 2.0.34, and I've
used my Zip-250 with 2.2.[589] without problems - the 2.0 series
kernels (including 2.0.36) do not include the imm driver, so it can't
be used with them...
Best wishes from Riley.
