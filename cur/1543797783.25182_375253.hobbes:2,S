One problem I still have with this implementation (well, if I remember
correctly David's has the same problem) is that it's not possible to
read/write from/to the SPI bus in interrupt context.
How do you handle IRQ's generated by a SPI device (e.g ack the
interrupt, check if it was the SPI device that generated the
interrupt, ...) if you can't read/write on the SPI bus from interrupt
context?
