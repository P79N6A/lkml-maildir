1) The user stack is in user space, which can only be
   accessed by this process (or any sharing the same
   vm). Trying to access the stack of another process
   would fail.
2) The stack pointer is used to find the task_struct
   of the current process. You'd need another location
   for the task_struct, and a way to find it.
3) Various security issues as others have already
   mentioned.
