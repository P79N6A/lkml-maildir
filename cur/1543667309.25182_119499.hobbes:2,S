Don't think so.
That lock protects the global list of registered formats only.  Because we
have a ref against the format's underlying module when that lock is dropped,
the module cannot be unloaded and nobody can unregister the format.  Hence
the thing at *fmt is stable, and reading fmt->next after retaking the lock is
safe.
The particular piece of code you quote would be buggy if it continued
to go around the loop and again used fmt->next.  But it will unconditionally
return after performing the put_binfmt() call.
