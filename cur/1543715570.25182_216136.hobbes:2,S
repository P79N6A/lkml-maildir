Tagged where?  These flags apply equally to both architectures.

Chances are good that with nforce3 you'll have some of the same problems
that nforce2 users have.

If you run the latest -mm patch, you can fix the XT-PIC timer
by passing "acpi_skip_timer_override" on the cmdline.
RE: USB is totally dead.
you've got a number of controllers, are they all dead.
hard to tell if the last one if taking the interrupts,
or if that is your sound.  perhaps you can disable sound
and see if IRQ22 becomes quiescent.
Re: TV station change freezes system.
Does it also freeze the system if you boot with "noapic"?
