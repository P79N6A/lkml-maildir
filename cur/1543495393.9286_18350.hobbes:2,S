I have the same machine (although with a slightly less memory :-) --
hopefully I can help!
The Superdisk isn't recognized as a floppy -- it shows up as /dev/hdd.  
Try 'mount -t umsdos /dev/hdd /mnt/floppy'
(This was my biggest problem getting Slackware installed initially --
once the bootdisk finished, the rootdisk was then not found under /dev/fd0,
but /dev/hdd, so I got stuck.  Ended up using Zipslack from my Win98
partition.)
The Superdisk works fine with both 1.44Mb and 120Mb disks, albeit rather
slow.  (You think it takes a long time to write a 1.44Mb floppy?  Try
120Mb!  :-)
The other thing that's handy to change, if you're using the mtools package
(e.g. mdir, mcopy, mdel, etc.)  is to edit the /etc/mtools.conf file
(or wherever it lives on your machine, so the line that specifies drive
a: says
# # Linux floppy drives
drive a: file="/dev/hdd" exclusive
(instead of /dev/fd0).

I'm using the excellent pcmcia package (3.0.6 or 3.0.9) from David
Hinds -- 
http://hyper.stanford.edu/HyperNews/get/pcmcia/home.html
I don't know if the kernel by itself supports pcmcia -- I think you
need to use this package.

The Superdisk doesn't need pcmcia -- it's just /dev/hdd.
It looks like some Xircom ethernet cards are supported by the pcmcia
package -- probably depends on which model you got.  (I'm using
a 3Com card.)

I already owned the Accelerated X server from Xi Graphics, so I'm
using that.  However, there is an XFree86 server available that 
I've also used which worked fine.
seth@sunflow.com has put up an excellent web page about his 9100LS,
which is where I learned most of these tricks:
http://www.sunflow.com/~seth/GW2k-9100.html
He has a link to an X server that he's modified that works fine.
The mouse (touchpad) is /dev/psaux -- it works just like a regular
PS/2 mouse -- make sure you have support for a PS/2 mouse either
compiled into the kernel, or loaded as a module.

I'm using the latest version (3.92-k) of OSS from 4Front Technologies
($20) -- I just got it to work yesterday, but it seems like my volume
is really low -- even turned up all the way, it's not very loud (not
as loud as in Win98).  So I think I need to tweak it some more.  I'll
probably also try the method(s) Seth mentions.
>6) Is there any DVD Support for the DVD that is here as well? Not a

The DVD drive works fine as a CDROM drive (data and music).  I haven't
heard of any actual dvd players for linux, though, and I have no idea
what'd be involved in writing one.  Anybody know of any DVD-linux
projects going on?  It'd be fun to help out.

There are a couple other very useful links to have:
The linux-laptop page:
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/
There are links to two other people's pages that have 9100s -- Seth's
is very good, the other one is helpful, too.  Between the two of
them, I have mine working quite well.  (Couple minor things to still
fix, but for the most part, it's great.)
Hope this helps!
Scott
