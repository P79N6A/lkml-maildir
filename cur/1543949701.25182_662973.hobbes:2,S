Yes it's overkill and it's becoming more noticable with larger machines.  
(Also, stop_machine is heavier than it should be, Kathy is working on fixing 
that though).
Most obvious is to add __ "lockless, but I'm in trouble anyway" accessors, but 
last I looked they'd have to be plumbed through a fair bit of code.
From a quick reading of the code, a lockless add is possible, but it's fragile 
if one of the readers does something more complex in future.
Thanks,
Rusty.
