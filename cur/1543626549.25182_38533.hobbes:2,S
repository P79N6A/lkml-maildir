indeed. I had and still have no strong feelings either way, a patch to
remedy this was promised by me but not sent. I made it _GPL for pure
technical reasons: i saw no non-GPL drivers in 2.5 that used it, and at
first sight the functionality looked internal enough to warrant the _GPL
export. But in any case, while i might have written some of the patches,
the principal author of the final interface is Linus. Hopefully this is
the end of this story.
