Ok, again :)
Kevent uses meaning of storage of kevents without any special knowledge
what is is (inode, socket, file, timer - anything), so it's
initalization function among other things calls spin_lock_init().
Lockdep inserts static variable just before real spinlock
initialization, and since all locks are initialized in the same place,
all of them get the same static magic.
Later those locks are used in different context (for example inode
notificatins only in process context, but socket can be called from BH
context), since lockdep thinks they are the same, it screams.
Obviously the same inode can not be used for sockets and files, so I
added above lockdep initialization.
