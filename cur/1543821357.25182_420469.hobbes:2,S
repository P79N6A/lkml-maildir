I agree.  I was (grudgingly) copying the style from the other helpers
in fs/fork.c.  Then I had to pull it out so it could cleanly return
-ENOMEM if !CONFIG_UTS, but I expect CONFIG_UTS to be yanked, and
this fn to be returned to fs/fork.c...
Might be worth a separate patch to change over all those helpers in
fork.c?  (I think they were all brought in along with the sys_unshare
syscall)
Agreed on all your other points, thanks.
