Yes, but it doesn't stop deadlocks caused by kernel's VM system going
wild... I think that no matter what user process does, root should be always
able to stop it. User process should never be able to render whole system
unusable.
Hard memory limit per process doesn't stop this from happening, because it
depends overall system memory usage and allocation rate. It's completely
different if memory usage goes from 200 MB to 512 MB in 1 usec or 1 week.
