Wow!
This has had a hard time historically. I'm really glad NUMA-Q's are now
immune (in the sense of correctness) to this config; previously it was
believed that preemption points in printk(linux_banner) would take out
the machine early in boot if preemption was enabled.
Congratulations rml!
If you're booting without issues on these things, you are a _very_ long
way toward being race-free. This is incredibly good news, both for the
preemption support, and for the general stability of the i386 bootstrap.
All that's really left is driver and non-i386 arch coverage if I'm right.
