Worse than that: r8169 in 2.6.9-rc[1/2] does not advertise its ability to
DMA to high memory.

Can you simply try the attached patch with the network cable unplugged ?
It will not fix your issue but if the result & 0x08 != 0, you can probably
stop your testing for now as it will mean "known issue".
