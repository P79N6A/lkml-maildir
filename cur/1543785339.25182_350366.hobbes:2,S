I don't think a per-cpuset spinlock will be necessary (at least 
initially).
The complete active condition is actually (atomic_read(&cs->count) || 
!list_empty(&cs->children)). These means if any child is possibly active 
so is the parent. 
Modifications in the cpuset hierarchy require the cpuset_sem and an 
inactive cpuset, (de)activating a cpuset requires the cpuset_sem and 
(let's call it) cpuset_tasklock.
Callbacks from the allocator now only need cpuset_tasklock to access the 
cpuset via tsk->cpuset and to keep it active and an active cpuset can't be 
removed from the hierarchy.

You're right, it should better look like this:
	tsk->cpuset = NULL;
	if (atomic_read(&cs->count) == 1 && notify_on_release(cs)) {
		...
	}
	atomic_dec(&cs->count);
This way it only may happen that two notifaction are sent.
