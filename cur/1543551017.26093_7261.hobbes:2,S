Please base this on more on real time, not CPU time.  Netscrape consumes an
ungodly amount of CPU time and memory and I'd much rather have it killed
before anything else on the system.  If it wasn't blatantly obvious, I'd
check the argv[0] to see if it was "netscape" and kill it.  :]

But that favors ill written programs if it's based on CPU time.  I.e.
netscape and all the gnome/kde "tasklets" that take 8 megs w/ 6megs RSS and
.9% of a pIII-450 to manage the keyboard and mouse properties.

Step A) A heuristic that tags the program or process group consuming the most
RAM in the last N real minutes.  A run-away process is the highest target
here and is most correctly the guilty party.
Step B) A sliding scale of the youngest real program or process group
consuming the most RAM.
Step C) ...
