I don't think this is the right fix.  The only PCI helpers used in
code that is enabled with CONFIG_PCI=n are pci_unmap_addr_set() and
pci_unmap_addr().  And they're only used because no one has added
dma_unmap_addr_set() and dma_unmap_addr() -- the core code is properly
using the general dma_xxx API wherever possible.
There actually is non-PCI InfiniBand hardware coming, so we'll have to
fix this properly at some point.
