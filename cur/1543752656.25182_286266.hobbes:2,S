Ah, good point.
Just thinking about this naively, I come up with two scenarios:
  (1) SMP -- RT thread hangs one CPU.  Kernel threads can still run on
  other processors.  Rest of system continues running (degraded) until
  more RT threads hang the remaining CPUs at which time we end up
  with...
  (2) UP -- RT thread hangs the last remaining CPU.  Kernel threads
  can't run.  User processes can no longer write data to FS.
(Probably, this simplistic analysis misses some other, more subtle,
factors.)
RT threads should not do FS writes of their own.  But, a badly broken
or malicious one could, I suppose.  So, that might provide a mechanism
for losing more data than usual.  Is that what you had in mind?
