I just noticed the file
http://thebsh.namesys.com/snapshots/2002.10.31/reiser4.diff
had changed, the difference from the original 20021031 snapshot being:
--- fs_reiser4.diff.old 2002-10-31 14:11:50.000000000 +0100
+++ fs_reiser4.diff.new 2002-11-04 16:57:46.000000000 +0100

So either someone is messing about with your webserver or you want multiple
versions of the supposedly same diff floating around (not exactly suitable
for gathering bugreports, is it?).  If you're short on disk space, how about
gzipping the fs diff?  Squeezes down to ~500k from almost 2MB.
