Ok but there are actually 2 real problems then...
1.
TCQ on hda is enabled with queue depth 32 and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_TCQ_FULL enabled
When I do many transfers on the hard disk I get a "ide_dma_queued_start: abort (stat=d0)" after some time and the IDE system doesn't respond anymore :(
2.
when I cat /proc/ide/ide1/hdc/identify I get 2 unexpected interrupts
hdc and hdd are both cdrom drives (accessed via scsi-emulation if relevant) but the problem shows up only with hdc
and maybe a third problem ;)
in /proc/ide/ide0/hda/tcq there is written:
DMA status: not running
but DMA is explicitly enabled by hdparm and shows up in /proc/ide/ide0/hda/settings
I'll do some more testings later the day
