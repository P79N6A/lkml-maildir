Did anyone see this?
I did some number crunching and with about 15Mb/s read and 9Mb/s write
I end up copying files on the hard drive locally at about 3Mb/s
(rounded). Which is really lame getting twice without encryption was
much better.
I'm using the ata_piix driver in the 2.6.22.1 kernel.
Thanks,
