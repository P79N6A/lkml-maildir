instead of trying to freeze most of the system, could you do something 
like start a virtual machine sandbox to write the data out, and not let 
any userspace other then the sandbox operate?
you would need to throw away disk buffers so that you don't mix current 
pending I/O with I/O from the sandbox, and this would be a visable change 
for how suspend is setup, but wouldn't this work?
