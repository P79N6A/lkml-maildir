Just press ^C to stop this loop:
while true; do (cat /dev/tty > /dev/null &); done
(I tried this at the console).
BTW: There is a security issue related to rebooting
without syncing disks: unflushed files will contain
garbage, and this garbage can be some data the owner
of the file should not see. Eventually, kernel
bugs etc. can be (potentially) used to gain access
to unused portions of the disk. (I know, one should
use chattr +s, but maybe this is not necessary?)
