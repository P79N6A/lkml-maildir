Hi Sam,
Patches to remove KPROBE_ENTRY and KPROBE_END are currently
in the x86-tree.
PROC/ENDPROC should be used around code.
ENTRY/END should be used around objects which are never
executed, like data arrays.
That should be clear enough, I think. The only catch is how
to decide where to use the annotations at all. I have no
complete answer to that. However, in general it would be
good to annotate any object for which an address can be
found in registers, on the stack or in variables. Doubly
so if addresses are within the object but not exactly at
the start of it. This includes assembly functions called
from C (instruction pointer) and arrays.
The macro's are used to align code and data, to identify the
object as code or data and to add object size information to
the debugging info.
Greetings,
    Alexander
