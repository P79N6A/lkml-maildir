Roland, thanks for providing this. I have some of those already, but I 
really appreciate the help. I take yours and the previously posted and 
push them out into a cleanup branch on my x86 git tree.
I guess it will be unavoidable that there will be some overlap on the low 
hanging fruit merges, but anyone who is tackling a more complex one should 
make this public upfront so we can avoid the redundant work.
Thanks,
