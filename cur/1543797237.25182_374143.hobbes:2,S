Subject: for_each_online_cpu broken ?

Whilst debugging a memory leak, I hit sysrq meminfo,
and got hot/cold info for CONFIG_NR_CPUS rather than 4 cpus
I fixed a bug recently in mm/page_alloc.c to change this from
a for_each_cpu to a for_each_online_cpu and I'm pretty certain
I tested that it worked, but for reasons unknown, it's now
misbehaving again.
I've only tried reproducing this on x86-64 so far.
