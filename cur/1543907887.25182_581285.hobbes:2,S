I'll try to explain better:
The old spinlocks re-enable preemption and interrupts while they spin
waiting for a held lock. This was done because people noticed some
long latencies while spinning. The problem however is that preemption
and interrupts can only be re-enabled if they were enabled before the
spin_lock call. So if you have code that perhaps takes nested locks,
or locks while interrupts are already disabled, then you get the latency
problems back.
So the non-hack fix is to keep critical sections short (which is what
we've been working at forever), and to have relatively fair locks
(which is what this patch does).
A side-effect of this patch is that it can no longer enable preemption
or ints while spinning, so my changelog is a rationale of why that
shouldn't be a big problem.
