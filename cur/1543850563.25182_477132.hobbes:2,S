And the patch does exactly that.
It doesn't assume much about TSCs, except that they're individually
monotonic and that without a warning (cpufreq notifier, c1 state
enter/leave) the frequency doesn't change quickly. Slow frequency drift
(spread spectrum modulation, thermal effects on Xtal) is compensated for.
We still are testing the patch and fixing the issues we find, currently
with our cpufreq handling, but I believe we're on a good way to have it
working well.
