Sounds reasonable.
However there is no reason to suspect it won't fix this case because
unconditional writes are what we have always done, and we have always
kept swapper_pg_dir from early boot as well.
In essence my patch I sent out to Andi was a partial revert.
It isn't slated to go in until nextround but I also rewrote the early
page table setup in C.  Allowing set_fixmap to work in the early
kernel, and fix problems of not having enough memory mapped to build
the identity mappings, because we are then updating the page table
we have also in the PAE case.
