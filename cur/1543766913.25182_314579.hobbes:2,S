Subject: [2.6 PATCH] remove include/asm-mips/hp-lj/*
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/27/253

This patch removes the unused file 
include/asm-mips/hp-lj/asics.h (arch/mips/hp-lj was removed in 2.6.10
but it seems this file was forgotten).
include/asm-mips/hp-lj should be removed as it will be empty after that.
