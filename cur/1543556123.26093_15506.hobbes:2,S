one more thing I remember when this happened:
a) lots of ld processes from kernel compilation were failing with ENOSPC
although df(1) was showing plenty of memory and I could manually "touch
ok" in the same filesystem just fine.
b) immediately restarting "make -j4 bzImage" would go on for quite a bit
and then hit the same set of .c files and "run out of space" again.
