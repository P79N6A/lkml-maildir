Look for BIOS updates. I have a BP6 (dual Celeron) system, and I am
really disappointed that the only way I can power it down under software
control is to boot to another o/s. You may be able to get a BIOS which
works.
Note: if you have SMP and the kernel insists on disabling power off
(like it's not thread safe or something?) you can use "lilo -R" to boot
a uni kernel and then shut down.
