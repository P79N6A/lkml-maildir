Beats me.  Where did the kdb patch come from?
It sounds like kdb for some reason is leaving the calling task in
in_interrupt() state when it shouldn't.  You could try removing the
in_interrupt() test, but things will probably die later on.
It might be worth disabling preempt, although a bug there won't cause
in_interrupt() to return true.
Did you send me your .config?
