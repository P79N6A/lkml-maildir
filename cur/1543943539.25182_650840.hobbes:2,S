    Documentation - Create laptops sub-directory
    
    There are currently various laptop drivers floating about with no central
    place for their documentation, which is currently scattered around the top
    level Documentation/ directory.
    
    So, as a first step, lets create a Documentation sub-directory, and update
    the relevant index files. The work of then moving the existing laptop
    driver related documentation will then be handled later.

    ACPI: thermal: buildfix for CONFIG_THERMAL=n
    
    This fixes the build, but acpi_fan_add() still needs
    to be updated to handle thermal_cooling_device_register()
    returning NULL as a non-fatal condition.

    cpuidle: build fix for non-x86
    
    The last posted version of this patch gave compile error
    on IA64. So, here goes yet another rewrite of the patch.
    
    Convert cpu_idle_wait() to cpuidle_kick_cpus() which is
    SMP-only, and gives error on non supported CPU.
    
    Changes from last patch sent by Kevin:
    Moved the definition of kick_cpus back to cpuidle.c from cpuidle.h:
    * Having it in .h gives #error on archs which includes the header file without
      actually having CPU_IDLE configured. To make it work in .h, we need one more
      #ifdef around that code which makes it messy.
    * Also, the function is only called from one file. So, it can be in declared
      statically in .c rather than making it available to everyone who includes
      the .h file.

    acer-wmi: Fix backlight on AMW0 (V1) laptops
    
    There is some leftover cruft from the old quirk infrastructure that causes
    us to be unable to set the backlight on older laptops.

    tc1100-wmi: Mark as experimental
    
    tc1100-wmi has not undergone as much testing as acer-wmi, so it certainly
    should be marked as experimental as well until we get more user feedback.

    ACPI: SBS: Host controller must initialize before SBS.
    
    In static case sbshc must be compiled ahead of sbs, so that
    hc is configured first.
