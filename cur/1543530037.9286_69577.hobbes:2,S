Perhaps I was a little bit unclear.  My question was more
like: "When you wrote up that patch, why did you choose not
to include the /proc/version part?"  You included it in a
patch that you previously wrote.
The reason behind that change was some discussion dating back
a bit where someone thought it would be useful to see the
compiler that was used to build the kernel with, because of
all the problems with people having strange results with 
different compilers.
/proc/version lists the compiler that was used.  uname -a
does not.  
Yes, ver_linux does print out your compiler, but that is
not necessarily the one that was used to build the kernel.
Is this a worthwhile goal?  Am I being clear?
Tim
