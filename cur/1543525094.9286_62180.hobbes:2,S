No. It could end up like this, but it doesn't end up like this right now
:-(
__free_pages_ok() aligns the buddy algorithm to "page - mem_map +
zone->offset".
This means that 44k starting at 4k will end up as
	32k @ 4k		x = 0
	8k  @ 36k		x = 8
	4k  @ 44k		x = 10
where x = (page-mem_map+zone->offset)/sizeof(struct page).
I doubt that this is a problem, because zones are aligned on MB
boundaries, but perhaps this could become a problem for a weird
DISCONTIGMEM embedded system.
