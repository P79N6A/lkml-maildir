Matti,
    Where do we stand here? Now that you have two of those outputs, so I 
can have some hope... Do you think we can make the driver for this hardware?
    How about the firmware that the documents mention? Could there be a 
layer in the hardware itself that might prevents us from reading the 
fingerprint image?
    Will BioAPI help us at all, or the best approach here is not to make 
dll wrapping?
Thanks for you all time,
- Alejandro
