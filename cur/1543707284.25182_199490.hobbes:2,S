 I do not attach it, as I think I have found the root of the problem.
Usually I save my .config to a safe place, copy it into the kernel
source, do 'make oldconfig', and only if necessary I do 'make menuconfig'
as well.

 I have. My shot would be that as CONFIG_FB_RADEON_I2C is y-n, but
CONFIG_I2C and CONFIG_I2C_ALGOBIT are tri-state as m in my case, the
problem can be that the functions are compiled into the module and
CONFIG_FB_RADEON_I2C can't find them in the static part of the kernel.
At least I do confirm that changing CONFIG_I2C and CONFIG_I2C_ALGOBIT
from m to y makes the problem disappear.

 Can the configurator force the dependencies to the same state? For my
case it should have change my m's to y's.
