The rule of thumb is that an option is either user visible and should be 
depended on or not user visible and should be select'ed.
Exceptions are possible, but there should be a good reason for them.
It doesn't matter much in this case unless you are really expecting 
people to use EMBEDDED=y (IOW: _very_ space limited system) and 
GFS2_FS=y/m.
