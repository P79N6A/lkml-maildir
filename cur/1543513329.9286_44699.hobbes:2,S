Actually the netmasks printed out by ip rule list are incorrect. Tried
both on 990630 and 990824. Example below.
ip rule add from 10.1.1.0/24 table 1 prio 577777
ip rule list
0:      from all lookup local
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup default
577777: from 10.1.1.0/0 lookup 1
                     ^^^
Yes - the netmask is always printed out this way. I never paid much
attention because I use ip rule in scripts. But David has a valid point
that ip rule list does not give enough information - specifically the
netmask.
