Hmm. Yes.
In 2.4 the preceding code is
        if (i >= NR_KEYS || s >= MAX_NR_KEYMAPS)
                return -EINVAL;
It looks like somebody removed this test in 2.6. Bad.
No doubt an error caused by "fixing" gcc warnings.
Shame on akpm.
When an array has an arbitrary upper bound that can be changed
via a #define, and for some values of the upper bound a test
is superfluous, that does not mean that the test is superfluous.
