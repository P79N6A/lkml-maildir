Actually not: cpu_relax() is defined as barrier(), it can't
call idle because that might make it sleep for a indefinite
amount of time (until the next interrupt, but only if they
are enabled).
Some nice architectures provide a hardware mechanism to do
cpu_relax, like going to low-power mode for a few microseconds,
but this one doesn't seem to have it.
