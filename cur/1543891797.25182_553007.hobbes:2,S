Last I looked PAT can only demote not promote the type of a page,
except for the specific exception of UC to WC.
Normally the default type is UC so putting a pat type of WB won't
help anything.  I may have missed some subtle detail but I remember
looking into this in some detail a while ago and coming to that
conclusion.
It is the BIOS's responsibility to mark all usable memory as WB,
using the MTRRs.  If it doesn't it is a BIOS bug.
