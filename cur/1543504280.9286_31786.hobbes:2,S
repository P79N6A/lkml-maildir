Assuming that the algorithm you presented works on all the different
sizes (which I think it will), that's a much more elegant solution
than the lookup-table idea I presented, as it's zero maintainance.

Is there any reason that wouldn't be the case ?
This whole nvram thing has got me thinking.
Would it be better if the fields in the /proc/nvram 'file' could be filled
in
by a userspace app on startup? This sort of thing could also be done for
quite
a few other things in /proc, saving a fair bit of space in the kernel.

Dave.
