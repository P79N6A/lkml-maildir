ok...
mkfs /dev/hdb1
dd if=/dev/zero of=some-file bs=x count=x
		What can fragment this file????
after that - wget 
http://localhost/some-file
 - watch vmstat, and find it's
pushing data at around 28 MB/s
then - start ten wget's retrieving different files, and watch vmstat,
finding the maximum thoughput I can get is ~ 10 MB/s - almost one third.
If I could tell the kernel, the app (tux) or whatever, to do readahead -
say some 4 megs per file, it'd work like hell! Seeks are reduced to a
minimum and everyone's happy again

I beleive there used to be a utility called 'frag' or something, to check
the fragmentation of files
