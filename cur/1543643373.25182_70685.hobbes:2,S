btw, if you run into troubles with networking with aa2 try to backout
the last net-softirq patch, not sure why yet but the last modification I
did malfunctions with some nic. Couldn't reproduce it here, but I'll
look into that next week and I'll fix it too for the next -aa. 
So, returning to xfs, it is possible dbench really generates lots of
simultaneous vmaps because of its concurrency, so I would suggest to add
an atomic counter increased at every vmap/vmalloc and decreased at every
vfree and to check it after every increase storing the max value in a
sysctl, to see what's the max concurrency you reach with the vmaps. (you
can also export the counter via the sysctl, to verify for no memleaks
after unmounting xfs)
