I'm all for the ability to set the default to whatever governor the
user wants. I _always_ run my laptops with the ondemand governor, my
Pentium M-based PVR runs with ondemand too, and only my old P4 box
doesn't because it's pointless. If you're running servers that
_aren't_ going to be idle most of the time, then by all means set your
default to performance, or just don't enable cpufreq at all, but give
the rest of us the option.
Particularily with laptops, I've always wanted the kernel to boot and
immediately slow the CPU down, even if all I do is boot into single
user mode, or even bypass init altogether. This will give best battery
life and coolest operation out of the box without having to rely on
userland whatsoever.
I had an old laptop a while back that _would_ overheat and shutdown
within a couple of minutes, even though idle, if booted to single user
mode because the cpu freq wasn't slowed down.
