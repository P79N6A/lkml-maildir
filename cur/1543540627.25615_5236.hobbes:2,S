You are right Andrzej.
I re-tested the compilation of kernel-2.4.0-test4 with gcc-2.7.2.3 and
this time it seems to compile just fine including all the modules.  I
had actual errors a couple weeks ago that prevented it from completing
the compilation of 2.4.0-test2 with that compiler.  I immediately
tried egcs-1.1.2 and it compiled.  Unfortunately, I did not save a log
of the errors, so I am not sure why it failed.  Maybe, if I get the
time, I will re-test with the test2 kernel and see if it fails again,
but if I do not need to backtrack from the test4 kernel for any reason
I probably will not bother with it.
Thanks for the patch anyway :-).
Vincent
