We are developing Linux based, Bluetooth access points (Engineering models
are available) and can soon supply mass produced USB dongles (factory is
building them now), but a generic Bluetooth driver isn't something that can
easily be included in the Kernel itself, since the modules are still
evolving too rapidly.  In a couple years it would probably be a different
matter when the module market has stabilized a bit.
