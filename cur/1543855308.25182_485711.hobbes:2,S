You could try applying the (untested) patch below and booting with
the parameter "kstack=2048", then regenerate the problem stack
traces. This should give you a complete raw stack dump in addition
to the call trace for each overflow.
(Output could get very large, so maybe adding a counter and stopping
after ~100 events might also be a good idea.)
