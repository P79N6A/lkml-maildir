I don't know how it would prevent fragmentation from building up
anyway. It's commonly the case that potentially unmovable objects
are allowed to fill up all of ram (dentries, inodes, etc).
And of course,  if you craft your exploit nicely with help from higher
ordered unmovable memory (eg. mm structs or unix sockets), then
you don't even need to fill all memory with unmovables before you
can have them take over all groups.
