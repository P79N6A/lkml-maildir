If you have a syslogk running the Oops should end up on disk (unless of course
the machine crashes or tht disk subsystem dies). For example I get mine
logged in /var/log/messages, and my USB test box has quite a collection
from my experiments.
Even more ideal would be to dump the oops to somewhere non volatile over
a reboot. I'm not sure there are good candidates for this on a PC.
