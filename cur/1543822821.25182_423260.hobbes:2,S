Ok, that's just _strange_. Clearly bisection picked the right commit, 
since:

but at the same time, I don't see what that two-liner patch to 
block/genhd.c has to do with that trivial module which doesn't even _use_ 
any of the functions that the patch affects.
It sounds like you used some other test-case than the trivial module above 
to test bisection?
So when you say "I tracked _it_ down with git bisect" (my emphasis), it 
sounds like "it" was really something else than the trivial stand-alone 
module. Or are you saying that the trivial stand-alone module _also_ got 
fixed?

Yes. We could just revert that commit, but it seems correct, and I'd 
really like for somebody to understand _why_ that commit matters at all. I 
certainly don't see the overlap here..
So I get the feeling that you bisected just the case below, right?

Hmm. Jens? Any ideas?
