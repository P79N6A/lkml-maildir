Hi,
I reported/posted a workaround for this yesterday.  If you just want
to continue with testing, you can try it.  If it gets further and
locks trying to fire off init, I posted a workaround for that too.
(don't try either one if you're not on a bic-disposable test box;)
The failed dependancies thing sounds to me like you need to upgrade
modutils to >= 2.3.13.
