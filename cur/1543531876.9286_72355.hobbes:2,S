Task is never, never, I repeat, NEVER is killed as result of overcommiting.
Task CAN be killed if there are not enough memory. With overcommit or without
overcommit (memory can be used by kernel itself and we'll end up with OOM).

You always can get this problem. With overcommit or without overcommit.
Or you can just freeze all system in OOM -- usully MUCH worse then killing
some not-so-important tasks.

Heh. And who will track this "appropriate size" ? Who will redo programs with
shared memory to use complex and error-prone procedure to allocate chunks of
shared memory instead of one big few MiBs segment ?
In "ideal world" system without overcommiting will be more robust. In real
world without overcomminting you'll get MUCH less robust system due to lots
of stupid tricks in programs and error in those tricks not needed is overcommit
is allowed.
