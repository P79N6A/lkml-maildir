Because global registers are faster!  This is exactly the kind of
stuff that is properly CPU-dependent and should be treated as such.
Heck, it even depends on what kind of multiprocessor architecture, if
any, you're using!
That being said, I belive that on most, if not all, processors, the
idea of having the pointer point not to "current" but to a per-CPU
memory area is *very* appealing, and a change that should be made
uniform unless it's a significant lose on some machines...
