It seems to me that SystemTap does present a sensible need to have
these exports.

I'm not sure what else you would suggest for this usage model.
SystemTap dynamically generates modules based on user scripts, so
this isn't something that can be added to the tree.
If SystemTap is to be able to make use of hrtimers, the only alternative
I see is to create our own APIs in the tree that wrap hrtimer, and then
export those.  This seems much less sensible than just exporting what is
already there...
