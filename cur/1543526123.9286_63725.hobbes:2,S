If "naive user" == "windows user" then said user EXPECT to see pop-up window
if disk was removed to fast. Typical Windows user sees BSOD with request to
put "right disk" back in CD/floppy driver so often that ANY other behaviour
will be surprise to him. If you want "least surprise scheme" you should
implement scheme complete with pop-up boxes (Windows9X BSOD can be replaced
with nice Windows NT-style dialog :-) or not implement it at all. Since ONLY
in such case user should not learn anything new: if you should learn something
then why not teach it to mount/umount disks manually; if users should be able
to use disks "just like in Windows" the whole scheme should be implemented.
