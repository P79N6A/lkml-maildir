A bit new idea.  How about this ?
==
- Set PG_arch_1 if  "icache is *not* coherent"
- make flush_dcache_page() to be empty func.
- For Montecito, add kmap_atomic(). This function just set PG_arch1.
  Then, "the page which is copied by the kernel" is marked as "not icache coherent page"
- icache_flush_page() just flushes a page which has PG_arch_1.
- Anonymous page is always has PG_arch_1. Tkae care of Copy-On-Write.

looks easy ?
