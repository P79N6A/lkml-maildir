You are correct. What I meant to say was that it's just a more efficient version of 'mmap'ing a file and then 'write'ing from the 'mmap'. The 'write' to a non-blocking socket can still 'block' on disk I/O.

There are many different techniques and which is correct depends on what direction you want to go. POSIX asynchronous I/O is one possibility. Threads plus epoll is another. It really depends upon how much performance you need, how much complexity you can tolerate, and how portable you need to be.
