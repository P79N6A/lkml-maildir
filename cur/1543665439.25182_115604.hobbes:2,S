20:12 is easier for the current behaviour. 12:20 with the ability to hand out
sections of space has great potential for lumping things like "disks", 
"serial ports" and so on together in more logical ways. 12:20 also makes the
compatibility logic easier since all of the legacy space falls in "major 0"
which becomes the remangler.
Is there any reason for not using CIDR like schemes as Al Viro proposed a long
time back (I think it was Al anyway). That also sorts out the auditing problem
