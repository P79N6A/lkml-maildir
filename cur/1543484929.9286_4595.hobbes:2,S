Kernel 2.0.35
Just a minor question. I notice that when I look at /proc/stat the btime
entry is unstable. The last digit will change +- 1 
I am trying to automate some system monitoring and thought I could look at
the btime entry to spot a reboot.  If the btime entry is > than the last
time I looked, it must have rebooted. That will not work because btime
keeps wiggling around on me.
BTW, if any of the procps folks are reading this:
free -s <any-number>
does not work for me if redirected or piped. It only works to a terminal.
