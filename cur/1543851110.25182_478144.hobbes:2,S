It can if PCI-X/PCI-Ex spec is anything to go by.
For example, see table 2-23, transaction ordering rules, in the PCI-express
spec: it is marked as "Y/N: there are no requirements.  The second transaction
may optionally pass the first transaction or be blocked by it."
In typical systems the OS should take care not to start a new
non-posted transaction before the previous one completed.
In particular, all intel and ppc systems I've seen simply block the CPU
unti the split completion arrives.
I find it hard to believe that Altix des not supply a way to check
that completion for config write transaction has arrived.
