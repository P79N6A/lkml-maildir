I planed to map the Unix Sockets abstract name space to a file system
for some time now.  Because it would be silly to write another file
system just for that rather obscure feature, would it be possible
to use a subdirectory in your new shm filesystem? I haven't looked
at the code at all yet, and don't know if it can even deal with 
directories and special devices. Do you have objections to such 
a direction?
