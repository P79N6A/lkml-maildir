Kosaki-san:
Again, my doing.  I agree that the calculation is a bit strange, but I
wanted to "future-proof" this function in case we ever get to a value of
'6' for the lru_list enum.  In that case, the AND will evaluate to
non-zero for what may not be a file LRU.  Between the build time
assertion and the division [which could just be a 'l >> 1', I suppose]
we should be safe.
Thanks,
Lee
