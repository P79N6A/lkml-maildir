I am all for giving this decision to the end-user or the distribution which will
configure the kernel. There is no "perfect" or "for all" solution that I am
aware of.
* Users debugging servers will more likely want the kprobe or jprobe option.
* Users interested in high performance tracing will want fprobe and/or jprobe.
* Users interested in embedded systems will want to avoid tools outside the
  kernel that rely on module loading : their kernel often not even support
  modules. -> fprobe

M. Bligh's idea is an interesting use of fprobes through modules that could make
dynamic tracing more effective for accessing local variables. It does not
change anything to the various needs of the above-mentioned class of users,
except that it may make life of high performance and server users easier. With
or without his idea, the goal of this marker mechanism is to meet all those
user's different needs.
