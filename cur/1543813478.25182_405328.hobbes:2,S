At least a different copy of /proc/sys/net/route :)

I need to look a little deeper but I think if we add two helper
functions: One that returns the address of a value based upon our state,
and another that returns a subdirectory based upon our state I think we
should be ok.
Both of them taking a struct task_struct argument so we can make the decision
what to show based upon the calling process.

Sounds like a decent idea.
What I have found so far with access rights is that if you dig deep enough
you don't need magic to make it safe.  But this may only be because I have
not hit something that is fundamentally different.
