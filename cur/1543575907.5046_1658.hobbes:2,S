I'll give that a try when I get a chance.  :)

Yes.  Definately.  There are probably other ways of doing that... but one
of the things we implemented was a "generic" character device... and we
tested it by having a chardev server that basically reads from a
"local" (to the server) character device, and forward it over CORBA.  So
this is already implemented!  :)
