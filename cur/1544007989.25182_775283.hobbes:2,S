Linus, just a note.
I don't know what the point of my reviewing and replying to Al's
patches is, if you're going to apply them anyways.
I also applied all of his other sparc64 patches (the ones I did think
were OK), but I did so to my sparc-next-2.6 tree, as none of this
stuff really needs to go into 2.6.28 at this point.
I've already broken sparc32 by mistake with some section annotation
"fixes" I thought were obvious.  So it's just not worth the risk in
my opinion.
And I gave suitable "applied" responses to those postings as well.
Yet you applied those to your tree directly too.
Sure, if the changes are OK, you applying them directly is fine.
But I did NAK this one specifically.
Again, just FYI...
