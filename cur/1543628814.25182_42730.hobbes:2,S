At high scheduling rate you task switch more often than you hit the timer,
so you want to handle it in a lazy manner most of the time. Ie so long as
the timer goes off before the time slice expire why frob it

At the point you think about setting the timer register you do
	next_clock = first_of(timers->head, next_timeslice);
	if(before(next_clock, current_clock)
	{
		current_clock = next_clock;
		set_timeout(next_clock);
	}
