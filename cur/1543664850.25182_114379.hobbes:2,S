Dear Miguel Gonz?lez Casta?os,
Once you wrote about "Updating the kernel of a RedHat 7.3":
MGlCo>  I have followed the instructions of redhat of how to upgrade a kernel
MGlCo> downloading from the upgrades.redhat.com web page the corresponding
MGlCo> RPMs.
It looks like you haven't followed all instructions...
MGlCo>  I have downloaded the following RPMs for my fresh installation:
MGlCo>  kernel-2.4.18-24.7.x.i686.rpm
MGlCo>  kernel-source-2.4.18-24.7.x.i686.rpm
MGlCo>  kernel-smp-2.4.18-24.7.x.i686.rpm (since its a double proccesor box)
Sometimes you need a little more then that, like modutils, for example.
MGlCo>  I did the upgrade of the kernel-source RPM and had to use -ivh --nodeps
MGlCo> --force options to install the kernel and the kernel-smp RPMs.
Using either of --nodeps and --force is asking for troubles... not to
mention a combination of two.
MGlCo> 
MGlCo>  I noticed that the kernel progress bar only reached the 50%.
Bad sign.
MGlCo>  Everything seems to be fine, but what could be wrong or everything is
MGlCo> fine?
If you can run lilo without any complaints, I'd call it a pretty good
sign.  Otherwise, noone knows. :)
