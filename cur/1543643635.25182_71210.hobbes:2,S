I've never seen this in the patch. It sure isn't in it now.
To be more precise:
net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_standalone.c:ip_refrag() is (or can be) 
attached to the NF_IP_POST_ROUTING hook. This function calls:
net/ipv4/ip_output.c:ip_fragment()
In this function the copy of the Ethernet frame is added for each fragment (by 
the br-nf patch).
The bridge-netfilter patch lets IP packets/frames passing the 
NF_BR_POST_ROUTING hook go through the NF_IP_POST_ROUTING hook, so the 
ip_fragment() code is executed while the IP packet/frame is really in the 
bridge code. After this, the fragments get queued:
net/bridge/br_forward.c:br_dev_queue_push_xmit() calls dev_queue_xmit()
Lennert's previous mail says in which cases and why this header copy has to be 
explicitly done.
The following document might be useful to know what we are doing:
