We are well aware of that, and we will of course make every effort
possible (short of a complete redesign) to restructure the code to 
have the smallest possible footprint, and to make it modular so that
it can be configured according to the needs of the application and 
the available hardware configuration.
That being said it must also be noted that the main focus of the
original XFS design was systems with large amounts of main memory
and large numbers of disk spindles. This doesn't make it incapable
of running on smaller systems, but as with everything else there
will be a point of diminishing returns or some size where it just
won't fit.
