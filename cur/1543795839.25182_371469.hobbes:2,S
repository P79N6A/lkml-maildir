You missed my point... Andrew suggested that since the new behaviour is
not fully functional that a revert was in order until a new version is
available. I agreed, because the old broken behaviour is at least
expected, while waiting for the floppy driver to check is not, and old
problems are less likely to cause a problem until a fixed fix is in place.
