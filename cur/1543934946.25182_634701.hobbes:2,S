pktcdvd sets it when opening the /dev/pktcdvd device, but when the
drive is later opened as /dev/scd0, there is nothing that sets it
back. (Btw, 40944 is possible if the disk is a CDRW that was formatted
with "cdrwtool -m 10236".)
The problem is that pktcdvd opens the cd device in non-blocking mode
when pktsetup is run, and doesn't close it again until pktsetup -d
is run. The effect is that if you meanwhile open the cd device,
blkdev.c:do_open() doesn't call bd_set_size() because bdev->bd_openers
is non-zero.
I don't know the correct way to fix this. Maybe adding bd_set_size()
to sr.c:get_sectorsize() which already does set_capacity() would
work.

I can repeat this bug, both with and without the scsi patch that is
claimed to make a difference, both with an external USB drive and an
internal IDE drive.
To repeat:
  1. Start with an empty drive.
  2. pktsetup 0 /dev/scd0 
  3. Insert a CD containing an isofs filesystem.
  4. mount /dev/pktcdvd/0 /mnt/tmp
  5. umount /mnt/tmp
  6. Press the eject button.
  7. Insert a DVD containing a non-writable filesystem.
  8. mount /dev/scd0 /mnt/tmp
  9. find /mnt/tmp -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sha1sum >/dev/null
  10. If the DVD contains data beyond the physical size of a CD, you
      get I/O errors in the terminal, and dmesg reports lots of
      "attempt to access beyond end of device" errors.
