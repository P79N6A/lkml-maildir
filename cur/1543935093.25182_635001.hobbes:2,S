(Adding the kernel list back. Any reason you did not send the reply there?)
Sorry for the late reply: Christmas, New Year, the flue, etc.

And thank you for the reply, although I must admit that I'm still confused.

OK. The change for Mem from 4 to 12 could explain the extra "iomem range" 
messages (although I don't quite understand why resources that "could not 
be reserved" still use a slot).
I do not yet see how the "ioport range" messages increased from 0 to 16 is 
explained, but I'm not too worried about that.

Are the _errors_ really harmless?
Your commit message was:
"It brings that some resources can't be reserved and resource confilicts.  
This will cause PCI resources are assigned wrongly in some systems, and 
cause hang. This is a regression since we deleted ACPI motherboard driver 
and use PNP system driver."
That text seems to indicate that not reserving the remaining resources _can_ 
cause real problems. Do we know what PCI resources are now not being 
correctly reserved on my laptop (and other machines)? The fact that the 
message is repeated 22 times seems to indicate that in my case quite a lot 
of resources are being ignored.
Should the memory allocation maybe be made dynamic instead of static if the 
memory waste is really such a problem? Apparently the number of PCI 
resources can vary wildly from one machine to another.
If the error messages really are harmless, shouldn't they be changed from 
ERR to DEBUG? As it is, the messages are extremely ugly and will probably 
cause a lot of people to file bug reports as it _looks_ like there is an 
error.
