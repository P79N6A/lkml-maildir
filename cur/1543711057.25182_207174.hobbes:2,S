I am running a SuSE 2.4.19 Kernel and have a requirement to allocate a 10MB
buffer (page aligned).
Is this possbile via alloc_bootmem_pages?
If so, how does my driver get access to this memory. I assume I have to
modify main.c to actually allocate the memory. My driver will get loaded
much later and this 10MB needs to be available all the time. Please CC me on
any responses.
Thanks in advance...
