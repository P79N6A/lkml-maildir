Subject: [PATCH 0/12]: MUTEX: Introduce mutex implementation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/16/277

This set of patches implements mutexes as an alternative to semaphores where
such more restricted behaviour is appropriate.
There are several changes that might be appropriate to these patches:
 (1) Name DECLARE_MUTEX as DEFINE_MUTEX in linux/mutex-*.h
 (2) Make mutex_trylock()'s return value consistent with semaphores rather
     than everything else.
 (3) Drop the testing module (patch 12/12). I'm not sure I've got the plumbing
     correct in the master makefile.
Patches to come after Christmas will include sem -> completion conversions and
sem -> mutex conversions.
Merry Christmas!
David
