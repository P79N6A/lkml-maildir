Because in Unix a name is not an attribute of a file.
Files are objects that you read, write and truncate. They are
represented by inodes.
Separately from that, there is an indexing structure: directory
tree. Directories map symbolical names to inodes. Obviously, adding a
reference to an index, or removing it from one requires access
permission to the _index_ rather then to the object being referenced.
That two-level model of files and indexing on top of them is essential
to Unix due to the flexibility and conceptual economy it provides.

And there are people believing that ITS (or VMS, or <insert your first
passion here>...) set the standard to follow. :-)

One thing is clear: it's too late to fix Netware. Why should Unix
emulate its lethal defects?
