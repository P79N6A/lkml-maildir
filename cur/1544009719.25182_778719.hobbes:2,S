Again, it's about inheriting *something* across processes. This
historically creates surprises. When the thing being inherited is a
privilege, the surprises are security holes. I can't tell you what the
surprises are, only that I expect there to be some.
mlockall is not a privilege in itself, but it is a non-standard mode of
operation that most processes are not designed for or expecting, and it
does relate to the handling of a finite resource with system stability
implications. If the thing that turns on this mode is buried inside some
poorly written app that decides it needs to mlockall somewhere, the
'surprise' can occur far away - in the child of a child of a thread an
hour later. And the surprise can be fatal - all memory eaten up, because
our process just happened to run without an rlimit.
I've seen this with RT. An app temporarily elevates itself to RT, and
unrelatedly forks another process. The second short-lived process kicks
off a daemon that sometime later consumes all CPU in a busy loop (in
this case waiting on I/O that never happens because everything else is
shut out).
Doing it as a container parameter means that you explicitly recognize
that 'everything in the container' gets this mode. And you've probably
also given a thought to 'how big is this container' and the like as
well.

Oh sure, I completely get that and I think it's a useful notion. And I
think the above analogous interfaces have more or less the same issues,
except that mlockall is a much older and more widely used API.
Containers are a better match here too, but the above predate
containers.

Huh? We would of course set up a container 'from the outside'. By
comparison, your mlockall() call traditionally operates from 'from the
inside', and you're proposing to add a flag and a helper program that
makes it work 'from the outside' too. Which is a bit hackish.
