I'm having problems with this.  I apparently have a cpio archive that the
kernel likes.  I am starting via grub with basically:
kernel /mykernel
initrd /mycpiofile
At first, I got "can't mount root".  A little reading in main.c has it
looking for /init  (shouldn't this be /bin/init instead?)
I moved my ./bin/init to . in my init filesystem tree and recreated the
cpio.  my ./init script is a "#!/bin/busybox ash" script.
running cpio -tv, I see:
...
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root       452508 May  5 14:33 bin/busybox
...
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root         1328 May  9 15:46 init
...
Now I see a message saying:
Kernel panic - not syncing: No init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel.
I did that.  According to the source, init= is overridden when /init exists.
I'd like to get off the initrd ramdisk style to save some more on space.
I assume it is populating properly since also I don't see the initial console
warning message.
