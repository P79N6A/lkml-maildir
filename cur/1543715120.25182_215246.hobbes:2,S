Targus mice misuse the normal PS/2 protocol so that they can sneak through 
command-filtering PS/2 ports (like on my Digital HiNote 2000). Basically they 
output very strange but valid traffic when the wheel is moved. Anyway, this 
is Linux, and I'd rather force people to turn it on explicitly rather than 
take the risk of breaking some valid PS/2 device which might theoretically 
output the same stuff.
