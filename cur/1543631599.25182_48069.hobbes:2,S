well the _big_ thing the freeswan people are afraid of, is exactly the
crypto laws in the us.
- here is a proposal which should be acceptable (at least i hope so :)
what about taking out the libdes stuff, and make it available from
elsewhere, and hook it into the kernel as a module?
the main kernel could come with a null crypto implementation - which
makes no sense to use, but it will allow to meintain the whole system
without having to worry about the crypto stuff per se (this shouldn't
change very much in any case)
	any comments?
