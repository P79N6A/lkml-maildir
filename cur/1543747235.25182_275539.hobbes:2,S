There is still a cpufreq/2.4 that I try sometimes to maintain and
support longrun.

That may be added if you justifies that enough.  Apparently, you want a
fixed frequency cpufreq driver for longrun?

cpufreq can help you IMHO. All the stuff you want can be done probably via
cpufreq.  Debugging support, governors for your perf work if this is
done in kernel space, notifier interface, and last but not the
least, a more generic infrastructure so that you can change
processors or architectures at will.
Please ask what you need exactly but at the cpufreq mailing list.
