At least the kernel and some core functionality (glibc) has been
traditionally written in GNU C, not ISO C. So no, that is not
a design goal.
Of course on the other hand GNU C is getting more and more like 
ISO C with the gcc people dropping extensions over time.
Some of the extension use is probably more by mistake, but 
others (like typeof, inline assembly, statement expressions) are widely
and intentionally used and would be quite hard to replace.
However people have built the kernel with non gcc compilers,
it just needed extensive modifications to either the compiler
or the kernel.
