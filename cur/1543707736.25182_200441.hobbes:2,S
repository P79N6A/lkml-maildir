Hi.
For those of you who don't know it,
ncc is a superb source code analyser especially
made for kernel hax0ring. See the screenshot at
http://students.ceid.upatras.gr/~sxanth/ncc
I apologise for the spam but since this prog can
make your life easier, it will reduce the number of 
traffic on this list in the long run.
PS - ncc ideas borrowed from sparse.c
Thanks,
stelios
