Would not surprise me, there's lots of room for improvement in reiserfs CPU
usage.  The 10k size is one of the worst cases for tail performance, those
numbers should increase if you mount with -o notail.
Here's a simple patch that should help on balance instensive apps (like
creates/deletes).  Please let me know if you see any difference with it.
