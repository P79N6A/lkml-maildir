Wrong, see include/asm-sparc64/irq.h, sparc64 has non-trivial __irq_itoa as
well.
To make them SMP safe, we could do something like:
sparc64:
#define IRQ_FORMAT "%d,%x"
#define IRQ_ARGS(irq) __irq_pil(irq), (unsigned int)__irq_ino(irq)
on say i386
#define IRQ_FORMAT "%d"
#define IRQ_ARGS(irq) (irq)
and drivers could use it without #ifdef __sparc__ like this:
                printk(KERN_ERR "%s: request irq " IRQ_FORMAT " failure\n",
                        ncr_name(np), IRQ_ARGS(irq));
The question would be what to do on sparc, but perhaps we could just throw the
,%x argument on some sun4d irqs (and only provide pil there).
Cheers,
    Jakub
