Please don't put the filename into a comment inside the filename.
It's not actually useful and it gets out of date very easily.

this one is only ever used with down_read/up_read so a normal
mutex would probably better suited.

These are rather odd names for constants.  They should at least
start with an uppercase letter if not be all uppercase.  Also
an enum might be right here.

Please don't put white spaces after the function identifier.

Normal style for block comments is:
	/*
	 * Initialize contents of config rom buffer.  On the OHCI
	 * controller, block reads to the config rom accesses the host
	 * memory, but quadlet read access the hardware bus info block
	 * registers.  That's just crack, but it means we should make

I don't think we need to save the few bits here and can just use
u8 instead of bitfields.

Please don't ever use __list_del directly, it's an interna implementation
detail.
I also notices that close to none of the export functions have kerneldoc
comment blocks.  I think we really should have them on something that
is a driver API.
