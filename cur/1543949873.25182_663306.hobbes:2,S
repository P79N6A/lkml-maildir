My understanding is that the $-form (as opposed to the @-form or #-form) 
is exactly that:
         memmap=nn[KMG]$ss[KMG]
                         [KNL,ACPI] Mark specific memory as reserved.
                         Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.
"Reserved" usually means "don't use as either memory or free address space".
