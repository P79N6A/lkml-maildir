That find check is somewhat incorrect (hard link count can be legally modified 
after the search was started and before it finished), but I did fix up the 
/proc problems that existed a while back.
This patch will give you a more useful error from findutils.

findutils-4.2.20 made me aware of the incorrect hardlink counts in /proc and
I've been fixing them up.
Although find made me aware of the issue, the message it prints could be more
useful: it doesn't show an accurate location of where the incorrect count
exists (instead, it seems to use the path that you gave to find on the command
line), and it would be nice if it could also report the hardlink count which
it read (on pseudo-filesystems like /proc this isn't very static).
