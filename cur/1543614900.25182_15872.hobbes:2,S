The new patch need ver >= 2.5.2-pre3 because Linus merged the Time Slice
Split Scheduler and making it to apply to 2.4.x could be a pain in the b*tt.
Yes, as i expected numbers on big SMP are very good but still i don't
think that this can help you with your problem.
It'd be nice to have inside local_irq_disable()/enable() a cycle counter
sampler to see what is the worst case path with disabled irqs.
