Subject: [PATCH] Remove *.rej pattern from .gitignore

Hi;
With commit "3f1b0e1f287547903f11fa1e6de7d2765597766e" Linus's current git tree starts to ignore any "*.rej" files. So "git status" no longer shows these files, but the ones who works with quilt patchsets, this not makes life easier as expected. Because sometimes a work flow (at least for me) requires "quilt push -f" followed by "git status" to see unresolved merge conflicts, work on these conflicts to correct them and finalize the patch with "quilt refresh".
And if there are some "*.rej" files exists in tree, for whatever reason, this means something goes really wrong there and i think this situation not deserves to be ignored.
This is the second time i came across with this patch cause the first one (

) ends up nowhere :)
