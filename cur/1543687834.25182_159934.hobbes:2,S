I don't have the hardware either, but the patch seems to be wrong:
The cli() call was in hardware_send_packet(). I assume that this 
function should be synchronized against concurrent interrupts - both 
functions access the hardware. Due to the dev_xmit_lock, the networking 
core already guarantees that hardware_send_packet is never reentered. 
cli() provided protection against concurrent interrupts on other cpus, 
spin_lock_irqsave() doesn't.
Could you add a spin_lock()/spin_unlock() into ni5010_interrupt?
