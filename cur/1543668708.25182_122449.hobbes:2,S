(please break lines)
(in case something is wrong with cfdisk, tell the cfdisk maintainer,
not the kernel list)
(what kernel version is this? - I see, 2.4.20)
According to WD, this disk has 78,165,360 sectors.
So, in case it was partitioned with such a size maybe nothing was wrong.
The boot messages shown say:
  kenny kernel: hda: setmax LBA 78165360, native  78125000
How come setmax has the right value and native has not?
Did other software clip the disk?
What is the identify data for this drive?
Was the partitioning done with a kernel that had CONFIG_IDEDISK_STROKE
enabled?
