Hi there.
I've made a couple of fixes to my flashmedia driver
(
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/tifmxx/
) to the
effect of much improved R/W speed in PIO mode and
writing speed in DMA mode.
I also tried to clean-up reverse engineering mess out
of the code - it should be more readable now.
Next on my list is MemoryStick functionality.
