I agree that unionfs shouldn't oops, it should handle that situation in
a more graceful manner, but once the "backing store" is modified
underneath it, all bets are off for either unionfs or ext2/3 behaving
"correctly" (where "correctly" doesn't just mean handle the error
gracefully).
But are you also 100% sure that messing with the underlying backing
store wouldn't be considered an admin bug as opposed to an administrator
bug? I mean there's nothing that we can do to prevent an administrator
from FUBAR'ing their system by 
dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/kmem.
where does one draw the line?  I agree that stackable file systems make
this a more pressing issue, as the "backing store" can be visible within
the file system namespace as a regular file system that people are
generally accustomed to interacting with.
