Look, SBUS does _NOT_ use the generic device abstraction.
Therefore all SBUS drivers call into the sbus_* DMA operations
directly.
Everything just works, as it always has, and it's not going to break
any time soon.
What I'm saying is that I'm not going to move the SBUS layer
over to use generic devices.
