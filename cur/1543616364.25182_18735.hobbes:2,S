Subject: kdev_t changes cause NVdriver compile failure?

Hallo,
I have upgraded from 2.4.18pre1 to 2.5.2-pre10.
Now my NVdriver doesn't compile anymore. I know, you don't want to deal with
third-party object drivers.
My knowledge is poor, but by investigating through nv.c from
NVIDIA_kernel-1.0-2313 and linux kernel headers I found relations to kdev_t
and I also have seen that there have been changes in latest kernel
pre-patches.
Might this be related?
Thank you very much, I'm missing X very much:)
