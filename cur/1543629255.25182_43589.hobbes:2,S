IIRC, there are some funny games you can play with 32bit PCI DMA.
You're not necessarily restricted to the bottom 4Gb of phys addr space, 
you're restricted to a 4Gb window, which you can shift by programming 
a register on the card. Fixing that register to point to a window for the 
node in question allows you to allocate from a node's pg_data_t and 
assure DMAable RAM is returned.
