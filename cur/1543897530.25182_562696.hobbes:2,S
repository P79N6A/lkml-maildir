sparse simply doesn't check that.  We don't have anything resembling
support of VLA.  Note that check for integer constant expression
has nothing to do with that;
	int x[(int)(0.6 + 0.6)];
is valid (if stupid).  And yes, footnote in 6.6 contradicts 6.7.5.2(1);
too bad...
We certainly need to do checks on array sizes; however, that part
("if it has static storage duration, it should not be a VLA") is minor.
And then there are gccisms:
size_t foo(int n)
{
	struct {
		int a[n];
		char b;
	} x;
	return offsetof(typeof(x), b);
}
Yes, it's eaten up just fine.  And yes, such structures are silently
accepted even with -pedantic -std=c99, which is a bug.  Sigh...
We'll need to tackle VLAs at some point, but it certainly won't be fun ;-/
