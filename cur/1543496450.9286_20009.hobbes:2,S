interesting...ive been having similar occurences every so often since 2.2.1 (on
2.2.6 now) although my setup doesnt make use of masq'ing, i do use ipchains for
general firewall stuff.  i have the exact same Lite-On chip as mentioned
above.  the panic i get is more like this:
Kernel panic: skput:over: c4022b00:19327 put:19327 dev:eth0
In swapper task - not syncing
since it didnt produce an oops but managed to make the system mostly
unresponsive, i tried to get some useful info from sysrq's (wrote down
registers and memory info but not sure if its of any use).  i had to kill all
tasks except init to get sysrq-s and -u to work (before i killed everything, -s
and -u were actually causing oops's themselves; afterwards they worked fine).
this brings up a question: if the kernel panics w/o an oops, can any of the
sysrq info be used to diagnose where the panic came from (similar to how
ksymoops works i guess)?
your message also just made me notice the version of the tulip driver we're
using is 0.89H.  i thought the newest version was 0.90? why is an older version
being distributed in the kernel i wonder...
