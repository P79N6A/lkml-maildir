Generally speaking when you see "strange" code mixed with gotos,
somebody has adjusted the code, often by looking at the assembly
output, to maximize the performance.
Of course, when the compiler changes, the code may no longer be
optimum.
In principle, if the labels in a switch represent incrementing
numbers, the compiler can generate fast code by using that fact.
However, often little care is taken in the placement of these
labels or the numerical differences between them so the code output
degenerates to a bunch of "compares". In this case, the most common
value should be the one checked first.
