Ack.  I agree we need to start moving faster.
I had a couple of distractions but I should be sending out some
relevant patches in a bit.  The more we can get out for review
before kernel summit the better the conversation will be I suspect.

I think I can get that one. Except for the very tail end though
most of my patches probably won't be directly pidspace patches.
I'm going to work on killing sys_sysctl a little before I
get to far into that.   A pidspace is one of the most controversial
patches so it is a bit tricky.

If you want to help with the bare pid to struct pid conversion I
don't have any outstanding patches, and getting that done kills
some theoretical pid wrap around problems as well as laying the ground
work for a simple pidspace implementation.
