Almost none and mostly very old ones. I'm not saying we shouldn't do it
(except where it hangs the hardware - hence the FIFO flag) but for the
traces presented and hardware reported it appears to be a bit of a red
herring.

Not in my experience having maintained a lot of ATA drivers for a very
long time. In fact the changes for draining the DRQ went into libata only
very recently because it was only when we had a distro sized userbase
with PATA devices that it became apparent that a few corner case problems
remained.
