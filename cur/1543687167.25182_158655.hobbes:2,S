This is absolutely not true.
There are two valid ways the RFCs allow systems to handle
IP addresses.
1) IP addresses are owned by "the host"
2) IP addresses are owned by "the interface"
Linux does #1, many systems do #2, both are correct.
We provide ways for you to obtain the behavior or #2
so there is nothing to complain about.
