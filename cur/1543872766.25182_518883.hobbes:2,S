Sorry for missing this hot discussion. Your idea is exactly what I want.
So many arch specific GPIO based I2C adapter implementation will benefit
from this.

Is this usage right, because 3 flags are added to this structure as
below:
struct i2c_gpio_platform_data {
	unsigned int sda_pin;
	unsigned int scl_pin;
	unsigned int sda_is_open_drain:1;
	unsigned int scl_is_open_drain:1;
	unsigned int scl_is_output_only:1;
};

Thanks a lot,  I will drop our GPIO based I2C driver and try this one on
our platform.

Can we add these udelay/timeout to struct i2c_gpio_platform_data? And
let customer to choose these according their specific requirement. We
use Kconfig to do this, but Jean and David don't like the idea, -:(
