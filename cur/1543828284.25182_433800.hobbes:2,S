Or this one so every user can set any value s/he wants. :)

 # Timer Interrupt Frequency Configuration

-	 Allows the configuration of the timer frequency. It is customary
-	 to have the timer interrupt run at 1000 HZ but 100 HZ may be more
-	 beneficial for servers and NUMA systems that do not need to have
-	 a fast response for user interaction and that may experience bus
-	 contention and cacheline bounces as a result of timer interrupts.
-	 Note that the timer interrupt occurs on each processor in an SMP
-	 environment leading to NR_CPUS * HZ number of timer interrupts
