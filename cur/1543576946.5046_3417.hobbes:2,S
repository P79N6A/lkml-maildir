I've already told you all twice the problem with my PCI VIA IDE controller,
and I'd like to say that 2.4.0-prerelease still is causing this problem,
even with the .config from my 2.2.18pre21 kernel that I know works.
(and I've subscribed to linux-kernel now so you don't have to CC me
replies anymore.)
