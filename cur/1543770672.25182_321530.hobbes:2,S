I have a chip on my motherboard which says "SMsC LPC47M192-NC", but the kernel 
module for it (kernel 2.6.12-rc5-mm1) doesn't work:
keenan@localhost:~$ sudo modprobe smsc47m1
FATAL: Error inserting smsc47m1 
(/lib/modules/2.6.12-rc5-mm1/kernel/drivers/i2c/chips/smsc47m1.ko): No such device
In the dmesg output it says:
smsc47m1: Found SMSC LPC47M15x/LPC47M192
smsc47m1: Device is disabled, will not use
What does this mean? How do I get this chip to tell me fan speed and CPU 
temperature (if that's even what it does?)?
