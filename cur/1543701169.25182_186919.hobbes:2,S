Can you give an example?
	One approach is to simply present a larger page size to userspace w/
getpagesize().  This does break ELF programs which have been laid out assuming
the old page size (presumably they try to mprotect the read-only sections).
On PPC, the ELF ABI already insists on a 64k boundary between such sections,
and maybe for others you could simply round appropriately and pray, or do
fine-grained protections (ie. on real pagesize) for that one case.
