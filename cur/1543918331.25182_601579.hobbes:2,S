That code should be fine. Further, it's pretty unlikely that this code
ever gets invoked. This whole interface was only recently added by
Google folks and its usage is pretty obscure. 
Oh wait - you're _at_ Google, aren't you? Perhaps you're actually
using clear_refs.
Well I can see no reason why the vma we just got to by the mm->mmap
would have a vm_mm != mm, but I've certainly been wrong before.
Try changing it to:
 	for (vma = mm->mmap; vma; vma = vma->vm_next)
 		if (!is_vm_hugetlb_page(vma)) {
			if (vma->vm_mm != mm)
				printk("WTF: vma->vm_mm %p mm %p\n",
					vma->vm_mm, mm);
 			walk_page_range(vma->vm_mm, vma->vm_start, vma->vm_end,
 					&clear_refs_walk, vma);
	}
