Yes, let me explain the idea.
When the memory consumption reaches a percentage of usage, as 98% or
something like that, we call this as red zone. So when red zone is
reached, the ranking algorithm is started to select which processes
could be killed whe out of memory happens. If the memory comsumption
is less than this percentage (not in red zone), the ranking algorithm
is not executed. So we have a loop the check the memory comsumption
all the time and if the red zone is reached, the ranking algorithm is
started before the system get the out of memory state.
BR,
Mauricio Lin.
