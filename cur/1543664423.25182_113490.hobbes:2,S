Ok I will see if that helps.

Actually that's not quite true. The report had a completely different
profile (lots of other functions had different percentages), so it likely
wasn't a comparable workload. I also don't think the NUMAQs are a good test
platform for this because they have 2MB of fast cache per CPU, while
the typical linux multiprocessor machine has much less. Yes you can 
fit an 1MB hash table into a 2 MB cache....
I'll generate some new numbers here locally over the weekend on P4,
but I only have a dual to test on and see how it performs.
