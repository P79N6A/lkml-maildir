Actually, I know I gave this as the magic incantation, but now that I see 
it, I realize that I should have told you to just use
	config ARCH_SUPPORTS_KPROBES
		def_bool y
instead, which is a bit denser. 
We seem to use both kinds of syntax for these things, but this is really 
what "def_bool" is there for...
