Andrew,
This patch fixes queer behavior in __wait_on_freeing_inode().
If I_LOCK was not set it called yield(), effectively busy waiting for
the removal of the inode from the hash.  This change was introduced
within "[PATCH] eliminate inode waitqueue hashtable" Changeset
1.1938.166.16 last october by wli.
The solution is to restore the old behavior, of unconditionally
waiting on the waitqueue.  It doesn't matter if I_LOCK is not set
initally, the task will go to sleep, and wake up when wake_up_inode()
is called from generic_delete_inode() after removing the inode from
the hash chain.
Comment is also updated to better reflect current behavior.
Compile tested only.  This condition is very hard to trigger normally
(simultaneous clear_inode() with iget()) so probably only heavy stress
testing can reveal any change of behavior.
