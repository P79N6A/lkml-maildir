I think that the reason behind such syscalls is to make sure that the
process is "clean" when it enters a new container. "clean" means that the
process is not holding in memory an identifier, like a pid for instance,
that doesn't make sense in the new container.
This is really a edge case which supposes that processes changing
containers don't know what they are doing. This case also depends on how
identifiers will be virtualized.
