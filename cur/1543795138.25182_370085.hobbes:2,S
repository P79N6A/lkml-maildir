it seems both.
now i'm using 1000hz with 0x40 latency.
i still get some noises but lower than before (lat = 0x20).
however i saw you marked it closed as hardware problem, i'm sure it isn't.
it' a linux 2.6 problem for me, as 2.4 and windows works perfectly. stop :)
a windows copy, running under vmware on linux 2.6, seems to work good too.
