And they're getting some real backlash because of that now.  Hell,
Linus' message was about udev in the first place.
As for the OSS API being crippled, I'd take the 3 ioctl calls you need
to setup a simple stereo 16bits output with OSS than the 13 ALSA
library calls anyday.  Especially with the impressive lack of
documentation you get about what the hell is a period, or what you can
do except aborting when you get an error.

Duh, then don't put the mixing in the kernel, put the data routing
there.  That's a large part of what the kernel is about, moving data
around, and Linus' new magic pipes are perfect for that kind of use.
Then at system startup and through udev you can start whatever mixers,
sequencers, virtual interfaces and stuff you want.  Applications don't
need to care, and you don't have the amusing security issues around
what happens when different users want to use the sound card at the
same time.
  OG.
