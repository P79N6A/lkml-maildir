Thank you for responding to my Post so quickly.
Conserning your two suggestions.
1.   The Memory Hole, which I have heard of.
     I have been in contact with a Lawrence Chan at lchan@jump.net who has a
     very similar System to mine, though with much more RAM, and it appears
     that my BIOS setup is correct.
2.   The possibility of Faulty RAM.
     I purchased the RAM from a Company, P.C. Service Source, which has a
     Business relationship with COMPAQ, to supply them with compatable parts.
     The new Storage was checked using a Hardware Diagnostic program supplied
     by COMPAQ.  
     At Boot time, I see the message 24576 KB OK
I therefore think that the problem is somewhere deeper in the System.
Thank you again for your ideas on solving this problem.
Yours truly,
Frank Krauss
