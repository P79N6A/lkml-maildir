If the policy forbidding self-modifying code lacks a method of
exempting programs such as JIT interpreters (which I doubt) then
it's a problem. I'm with Alan on this one.

This sort of logic might be appropriate for a sort of parametrized
and specialized vma allocator setting the policy in /proc/ along
with various sorts of limits. There are limits to such and at some
point things will have to manually manage their own process address
spaces in a platform-specific fashion. If kernel assistance here is
rejected they may have to do so in all cases.

As far as the kernel is concerned they're unrelated, so this will
likely need MAP_FIXED barring a staggering array of fresh system
calls to act on tuples of memory ranges in lockstep.

remap_file_pages_prot() is reputedly waiting in the wings somewhere
for this.

This is a bad idea. The standard semantics are needed for programs
relying upon them.

This is relatively innocuous.

You probably want a tmpfile(3) -like affair which never has a pathname
to begin with. It could be useful for security purposes more generally.

This sounds vaguely like another syscall, like mdup(). This is
particularly meaningful in the context of anonymous memory, for
which there is no method of replicating mappings within a single
process address space.

Presumably to be used in conjunction with keeping the old mapping.
A composite mdup()/mremap() and mprotect(), presumably saving a TLB
flush or other sorts of overhead, may make some sort of sense here.
Odds are it'll get rejected as the sequence of syscalls is a rather
precise equivalent, though it would optimize things (as would other
composite syscalls, e.g. ones combining fork() and execve() etc.).

Essentially more placement support for mremap()/mdup(). It's not clear
to me those particular semantics are the ideal ones. A target range
for placement should do, if not manual address space management.

This is probably going to happen anyway.

This is MADV_REMOVE, though most filesystems don't support it. Do you
need it for more than tmpfs?
