Has the recommended format for git submissions from maintainers to
mainline been described?
Presumably something along the lines of
1) create a specially named git branch in the maintainer's kernel.org
clone of the linux-2.6 git tree
2) create a summary of the changes with the output of cg-diff -r
origin:HEAD run through some filter
3) send an email message with the above to Linus
