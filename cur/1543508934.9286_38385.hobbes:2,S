No. Even if data bus is 64bit wide all registers are 32bit wide. If you want
to execute 64bit program you need 64bit processor at least. How wide is data
bus is irrelevant.

In case of 16bit/32bit OS it's simple: i386 (and up) CPU's can be in two
states 16bit (8086 compatible or 80286 compatible) and 32bit
(non-8086 compatible). You can execute 32bit program (DOOM :-) in 16bit OS
(MS DOS) doing switching all the time, but you can not execute 64bit program
on PC since you have 32bit CPU !

Yes. Just you need 64bit register :-)

All is correct. Only one thing is wrong: there are no 64bit registers on PC
(ok, there are few but they are not "normal" CPU registers anyway)...
