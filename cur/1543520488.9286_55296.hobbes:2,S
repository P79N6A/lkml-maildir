Hi all,
I am trying to install Eicon Diva 2.0 pci card on my linux box running 
Red Hat 6.1, kernel 2.2.20. 
The problem is that when a 
modprobe hisax type=11 protocol=2 is done
I get a error message Diva: No PCI bus found.
This error message is printed out in diva.c. 
But since CONFIG_PCI is defined i don't think this should be printed out
Can anybody help me out.
bye,
prakash
