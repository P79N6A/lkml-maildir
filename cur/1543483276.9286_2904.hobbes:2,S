OK, I was reading points (a) and (b) as though they were, in effect,
the required specificiations for an algorithm to yield the best
pages. Are they just comments on how the particular algorithm you
mentioned works?
I'd like to speparate this into two issues. Firstly, requirements on
how to lay out physical pages to minimise cache line aliasing.
Secondly, algorithms which are very fast in allocating coloured pages.
For the former issue, I'd like to establish whether you are saying
that points (a) and (b) provide better pages than the simple "add plus
modulus" scheme of generating goal colours?
For the latter issue, I'll gladly concede that the algorithm you
described is far faster than my simple hack.
