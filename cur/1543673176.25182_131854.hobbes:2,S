Only one request, that you push this slightly more, and make
setup_arch() call parse_early_args().  Does that break something?
That way the arch-specific parsing in setup_arch() can be converted to
__setup (but doesn't need to be: archs can take their time).
ie. we already have two-stage parsing, it'd be nice not to make it
three.
Minor nitpick:

Change comment to /* Ignore early params: already done in
parse_early_args */ or something, and maybe rename
obsolete_test_checksetup() to is_early_setup().
Thanks!
Rusty.
