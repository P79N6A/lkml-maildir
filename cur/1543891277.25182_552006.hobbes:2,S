<reviews thread again>  Ah, indeed.  I certainly prefer the old result 
to the new one.
With these old PATA devices, device reset is "six of one, half-dozen of 
the other."  Using SRST is the only way to kick some ATAPI devices into 
working:

I'm mainly interested in hearing feedback from Fedora 7 damage, before 
making a major decision about the probing code.  If this is a single 
dain bramaged device, we should avoid punishing the majority.  But if 
this is a trend, it warrants careful reconsideration.
The current code already has the IDENTIFY retry stuff, so it sounds like 
restoring the "don't care" part should be enough to restore the older 
behavior.
