You are correct that the Sylpheed FAQ, such as at:
    
http://sylpheeddoc.sourceforge.net/en/faq/faq-1.html
states:
    1.8 Q08 Does Sylpheed have mail filtering?
    A. Yes. You can find it in Configuration -> filtering tab.
    Please note that filtering is not yet implemented for IMAP accounts. 
And you are correct -- that FAQ is out of date.  It seems to be
dated 2002.
To answer your question, yes filtering now works fine on IMAP folders
using Sylpheed.  I make heavy use of it.  I'm using Sylpheed version
2.2.4 at the moment.

Be that as it may, whether Sylpheed IMAP folder filters worked or not,
I'd suggest that the Documentation/email-clients.txt file not engage
in evaluation of the general purpose feature sets of various email
clients, but rather confine itself to what matters to the kernel
mailing list, such as how to get patches formatted correctly.
