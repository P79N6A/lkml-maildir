Yes, my initial patch was wrong. However with the patch we no longer
throw away the non-PAE initial page tables and replace them with PAE
ones, instead we augment the initial PAE page tables. This means we only
need initial mappings of 4G worth of page tables rather than 4G plus
what is needed for the non-PAE initial page tables.
I don't think I explained that at all well on either attempt...
Hopefully what I mean will be clearer in patch form -- coming in a
second...

I'm just preparing to send out a version which uses the native_* way of
doing things, its not actually as clean as I would like so I'd be
interested to see the ASM variant.
