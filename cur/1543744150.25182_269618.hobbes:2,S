i've disabled *only* CONFIG_PREEMPT in another .config but it still oopses:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-debug_oops-2.6.10-rc1_no-preempt.txt
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/config-2.6.10-rc1_no-preempt.txt
2.6.9 with preempt enabled does not oops:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/config-2.6.9_preempt.txt
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-no-oops_2.6.9_preempt.txt
i was a fool to test further -bk snapshots but it was kinda late yesterday
 and i was confused:
patch-2.6.9.bz2          -> 19-Oct-2004
patch-2.6.10-rc1.bz2     -> 23-Oct-2004 00:12
patch-2.6.10-rc1-bk1.bz2 -> 23-Oct-2004 13:34
2.6.9 is not oopsing *here*, plain 2.6.10-rc1 is oopsing. so i can *not*
use -bk snapshots any more and i will go on with BK (undo the ChangeSets
Linus told me about) and use different .configs now. sorry for the
confusion and especially sorry to my bk mentor: we seem to be so close to
the right ChangeSet and then i started to use *snapshots* again.
Thanks,
Christian
