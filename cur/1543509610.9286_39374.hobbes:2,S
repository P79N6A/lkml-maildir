This is one of the two ideas floating around in
the ACPI4Linux project.  I'm calling this one the
"thin ACPI driver" model.  The alternate idea
basically integrates the AML interpreter directly
into the kernel which adds quite a bit of size
to the kernel (guessing maybe 300k+, ouch)

I definitely need to start putting together a good
device power management interface to implement
ACPI D-states.  Something like (to the driver)
"going into D2, save your device state".
Any ideas there would be appreciated (please
direct to the ACPI4Linux mailing list,
acpi@phobos.fs.tum.de)
Support for broken or non-ACPI devices will
certainly be kept in mind.  Of course, the
ACPI4Linux project needs to get a bit further
along before that's even an issue.
Thanks,
Andy
