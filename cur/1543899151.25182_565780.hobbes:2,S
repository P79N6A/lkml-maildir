Subject: [PATCH RT] don't BUG_ON in exit for in_interrupt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

For some reason, in the RT kernel, we have in exit.c a
BUG_ON(in_interrupt()) just before a check of in_interrupt() then panic.
With the panic, we get a nice output of what happened (considering that
the panic gives us a backtrace).
But a BUG_ON will cause a fault, and then try to bug again. This causes
a recursive fault which eventually eats up the stack.  Twice have we
lost information on a crash because of this recursive faulting.
This patch undoes the adding the BUG_ON in exit.c.
