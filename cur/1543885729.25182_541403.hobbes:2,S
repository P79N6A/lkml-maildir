modpsot does it best to guess what symbol are represented by an address.
In this case I would assume that realview_timer has a function pointer to a function
that is marked __init.

This is due to the reference to kernel_init - but binutils hardcode the offset
so modpost does not recognize the symbol.
A workaround (that I do not like) it to remove static declaration of kernel_init,
then modpost will recognize the symbol and see this is OK.

There are in slab a function that is not marked __init that refer to a function marked
__init. But the logic surrounding makes it OK.
I have no fix/workaround for this.
Andres has suggested that we should mark functions/data that may refer to __init{data}
with something like: __nowarn and __nowarndata
I am planning to implement something so we can mark functions/data with:
__init_ref_ok and _init_data_ref_ok
Which is indeed more ugly but expalins what is actually OK.
I hope to take a look during the weekend.
