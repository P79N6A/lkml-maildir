This is a Toshiba Satellite notebook 1800 (P3 mobile/1100, 256MiB RAM,
Trident CyberBlade XPAi1 (rev 82) graphics card; RH 9.
STFW for this machine I found that adding "vga=0x317" to the kernel args
uses the full screen on the virtual TTYs (normal is 80x24 in a small
rectangle at the center of the screen). I tried several 2.5 kernels, and
was convinced they didn't boot (no time to investigate further, sorry).
With 2.5.74 I noticed that the machine does in fact boot, but nothing at
all shows up on the screen until X starts. Deleting the "vga=..." stuff
shows the customary 80x24 rectangle, vga=ask gives a only a few 80x<mumble>
modes. The ones I tried are useless.
Anything I can try/hack to pieces? Not exactly urgent, but having
fullscreen vt's is quite nice.
Thanks!
