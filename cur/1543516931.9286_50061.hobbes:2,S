I've been running the memtest program continuously all day today. No
problems. It has to be a problem somewhere else, probably a nasty one
hiding in the ide-scsi eumlation layer since the last thing I did was to
copy a CD and burn a CD the night before. 
I recall that a IDe SMP race was fixed in the 2.2.14pre patches.
