Thanks to all who helped me out with this. The problem was CONFIG_NETLINK
and CONFIG_RTNETLINK, which I had not got around to trying. 
I guess this problem will pop up again in the future, when more RH7.2 users
want to compile their own kernels. Therefore it would be good to default
those options to yes, or even remove the options completely, as has been
proposed.

Thanks! Didn't get your site, didn't get google cache. Will look again in
the near future.
