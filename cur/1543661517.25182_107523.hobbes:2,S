I already responded to this concern in
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104316038729345&w=2 and
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-security-module&m=104316278400987&w=2.
At most, a field might be added to the ctl_table structure so that the kernel
can provide a hint to security modules as to its view of the sensitivity of
a given sysctl variable, but this does not require any change to the sysctl
hook interface.
