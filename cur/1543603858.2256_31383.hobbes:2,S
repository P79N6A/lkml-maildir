OK, if that's for the best, I'll rework it.  I thought it would
be cleaner to do it that other way, because it meant not having
any knowledge of the filesystem-specific quota data structures
and operations up at this higher (vfs) level.  Since ioctl is
available as a generic copy in/out facility already, I'm not
sure why any filesystem would abuse quotactl in this way, but
perhaps that's just human nature. ;-)
The only other reason that I was thinking of - I expect that 
Veritas' VxFS will also wish to provide its own quota subsystem,
as they seem to do for other operating systems.  Since (and I may
be wrong here) the intention there is to make VxFS a commercial
filesystem for Linux, it would also help those folk out if the
point of doing the user data copying was within the filesystem.
So, I was trying to do the right thing by everyone in making it
generic - your suggestion will work just fine for our needs in
XFS though.
Thanks for the feedback - new patch later.
cheers.
