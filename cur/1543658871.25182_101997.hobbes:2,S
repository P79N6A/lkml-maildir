There will be a new kernel tree that will fit this purpose soon called -xlk 
(eXtendable or Extended Linux Kernel). The hope to make it an 'official' like 
-ac, -mm tree for stuffing experimental stuff into a post 2.6 (or just before 
2.6 goes live) kernel. I will need help in getting this to become a reality 
in the coming months to 2.6.
The purpose of the tree is to get experimental code ready for the 2.7 (2.9?) 
tree. We want code that will add new drivers / devices and general 
improvements to the kernel. The goal is once these are stabilized they can be 
submitted to Linus and friends for blessings and inclusion into 2.7 dev 
*early* so we won't have a mad rush for features before the next feature 
freeze.
