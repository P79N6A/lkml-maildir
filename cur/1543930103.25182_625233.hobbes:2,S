Hi Bob,
The patch I posted earlier today (a somewhat cleaned-up version of a
patch originally from Liam Howlett) converts NFS to use TASK_KILLABLE.
Could you have another shot at breaking it?  You can find it here:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=119698206729969&w=2
(It has some prerequisites that are in the git tree, so probably the
easiest thing is just to pull that git tree).
Liam notes that there's still problems with programs that call *stat*(),
but I haven't looked into that issue yet.
