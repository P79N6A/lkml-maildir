axp-list is  for Redhat/Alpha. I  am not  subscribed either, since  i don't
care  a bit  about  Redhat configuration  problems (which  used  to be  the
prominent topic back when i still read it).
Can  we please  agree on  using  the VGER  lists as  authoritative for  the
kernel  and its  ports  and let  the vendor-specific  lists  be just  that:
vendor-specific? (Especially since axp-list is not open like linux-alpha,
you need to be subscribed to post to it. Not good for error reporting and
the like...)
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
