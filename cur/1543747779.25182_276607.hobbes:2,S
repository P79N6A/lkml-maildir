It does, thanks.
A concern which I have about the CKRM implementation is that the patches
which have been sent out appear to be simply the "core" of CKRM, plus
minimally-intrusive hooks.  I have the impression that this core will not
be terribly useful to real-world users and that follow-on patches will be
required to add more functionality and to wire up more instrumentation and
control points.
I would not like to be in a situation where we merge the "core" patch, but
the as-yet-unseen follow-on patches which make CKRM useful and complete end
up creating a big unmaintainable mess.  We end up not wanting to go
forwards and being unable to go backwards.
IOW: I think we need to see a reasonably-close-to-final implementation of
CKRM before we can take it much further.
