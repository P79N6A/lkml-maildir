Subject: 2.3.45 -- Problem getting my PCMCIA modem to work.

I am one of the folks who have been having keyboard/mouse lockups
in the 2.3.38+ kernels.  The lockups would occur when Yenta/Cardbus
were built into the kernel.  
With 2.3.45 and Cardbus support built as a module, my keyboard and
mouse work, even after I have run:
	modprobe pci_socket
	modprobe ds
I can insert my 3c575bt adapter and it appears to be recognized
correctly.  I don't know if it is actually working, because my
LAN is at work.
When I insert my PCMCIA modem, the device is not recognized
and I get "Cannot map memory" errors from card services.
Here's the snippet from dmesg:
Serial driver version 4.92 (2000-1-27) with MANY_PORTS SHARE_IRQ

Any idea what I need to get my modem working?
As you can see, I still get keyboard errors listed during
boot.  As far as I can tell, my keyboard is working fine
during actual use.
Thanks,
	Miles
