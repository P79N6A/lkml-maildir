Why is this driver parked in drivers/ide/legacy when the companion
driver, xd.c, is in drivers/block (where hd.c used to be at one point,
too)?  Especially so since it's not really for IDE, but for ST-506.
HOWEVER, the code that fails above hard-assumes that the ST-506 disks
that you have are your primary system drives, which is obviously a wrong
assumption -- ST-506 drives were obsolete quite a while before Linux
existed[1].
xd.c, on the other hand, seems to actually go out and query the hardware
directly.  I guess this is understandably, since this controller would
never have been primary.
If hd.c is pure legacy, which it obviously is, should we remove the code
to assume the BIOS settings are the MFM/RLL settings (i.e. the __i386__
clause), and instead do something more like the __arm__ clause which
means that "if you really want to use this you have to specify the
parameters manually"?

[1] The 386-16 that I had access to at Northwestern, which with 0.59
BogoMIPS was the slowest Linux system in existence until Linux was
ported to other architectures, might have been an ST-506 drive, but I'm
not sure.
