Allocating memory during page out under low memory could 
lead to deadlocks. That is because Linux used to make no attempt
to limit dirty pages for anonymous mappings and then you could
end up with most of your memory dirty and not enough 
memory cleanable for page out and then when page out 
needs more memory you could be dead.
[yes that implies that mmap over NFS was always broken]
Now there is a anon dirty limit since a few releases, but I'm not
fully convinced it solves the problem completely.

That would be lots of wasted memory. I already got >100 MB free
on my workstation under steady caching state. Already far too much imho.
