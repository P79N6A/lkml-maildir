We hope so.
The cpuset-aware-writeback patches were explicitly written to hide the bug which
Peter's patches hopefully address.  They hence remove our best way of confirming
that Peter's patches fix the problem which you've observed in a proper fashion.
Until we've confirmed that the NFS problem is nailed, I wouldn't want to merge
cpuset-aware-writeback.  I'm hoping to be able to do that with fake-numa on x86-64
but haven't got onto it yet.
