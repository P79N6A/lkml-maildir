Some results:
The patch applied cleanly after the draco/ide patch.
I tried it on a AMD K6-2/350 with 64M RAM using both scsi and ide
(using the alim15x3 driver) getting similar results:
  unlink     latency GONE..over 50-fold improvement :)
  write      unchanged at around 13ms, then up to 20ms later when
             buffers are flushed
  read       down from 5ms to 2ms
  copy       down from 10ms to 7ms (following the read & write numbers exactly)
  proc       down from 6ms to 2ms
In sum: the improvments are tremendous.  File write and buffer
flushing remain, however, to be improved.
I'm absolutely delighted how much Ingo has done with this, addressing
even things like the nanosleep() busy-loop.  I'll be glad to help in
any way I can in running down these write problems.
Best,
Eric
