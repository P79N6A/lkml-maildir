Well, you did the same with the usb/devio.c and friends :)

How does oleg feel about it ? I've seen some long thread on possible race
conditions with put_pid() and solutions with rcu. I didn't quite get all of
it ... it will need another run for me.
On the "pid_t to struct pid*" topic:
* I started smbfs and realized it was useless.
* in the following, the init process is being killed directly using 1. I'm
not sure how useful it would be to use a struct pid. To begin with, may be
they could use a :
	kill_init(int signum, int priv)
./arch/mips/sgi-ip32/ip32-reset.c
./arch/powerpc/platforms/iseries/mf.c
./drivers/parisc/power.c
./drivers/char/snsc_event.c
./kernel/sys.c
./kernel/sysctl.c
./drivers/char/nwbutton.c
./drivers/s390/s390mach.c
* some more drivers,
* some more kthread to convert
C.
