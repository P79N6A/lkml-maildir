I cannot for the life of me get LFS working.
I have recompiled the glibc rpm (the 2.2.1 one)
for i686 and installed it.  I have recompiled
fileutils against that glibc.  It still tells
me that the file is too large when I do a
dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=8192
it stops at 2.0GB (ls -lh).  What am
I missing?  I thought I had all the pieces
in place.  It works on another machine I
have.  I just don't understand why it does
not work on this one...  I have this gut feeling
its something really stupid but for the life
of me I cannot find out what.
Thanks,
Mike
