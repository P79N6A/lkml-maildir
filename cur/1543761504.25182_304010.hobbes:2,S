Also, those "ugly" switch-statements are not ugly and are
most efficient if the case(s) are enumerated types in
automatically-generated incrementing order. I see a lot
of values assigned to enumerated types which destroys their
usefulness. They might just as well be "#defined" values
if you do this.
Code that does:
enum {
    one,
    two,
    three };
    switch(val)
    {
    case one:
    case two:
    case three:
    ....
    }
... calculates the offset of each of those case(s) and branches
directly.
 	movl	(val), %ebx
 	shll	$2, %ebx	# Size of table entries
 	jmp	*table(%ebx)	# Table contains a list of switch offsets
If somebody does:
enum {
    one = 1234,
    two = 4321,
    three = 8765
    };
.. no such calculation is possible and the compiler output must
devolve to:
 	movl	(val), %eax
         cmpl    $1235, %eax
         jz      one
         cmpl    $4321, %eax
         jz      two
         cmpl    $8765, %eax
         jz      three
         jmp     none
one:
.... a bunch of comparisons. So, you make switches efficient
by using enumerated types without fixed values. Of course
some switches, such as found in ioctl() function numbers
must be hard-coded because they must correspond to whatever
the 'C' runtime library and its headers expect. In this
case, you can make them efficient by having no holes
in the allocated numbers and putting the cases in sorted
order. This gives the 'C' compiler a chance to optimize.
