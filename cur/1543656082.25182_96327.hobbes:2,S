Using my example:
mkdir a
echo "a/x" > a/x
echo "a/y" > a/y
echo "a/z" > a/z
mkdir b
echo "b/y" > b/y
mkdir c
echo "c/z" > c/z
mkdir d
mount --bind a d
mount --bind --overlay b d
mount --bind --overlay c d
cat d/x
"a/x"
cat d/y
"b/y"
cat d/z
"c/z"
Then...
echo "d/w" > d/w would create a new file in directory a.
echo "d/y" > d/y would replace the file b/y
etc...
Is this sort of thing possible, or are there fundamental reasons that 
would make it difficult?
