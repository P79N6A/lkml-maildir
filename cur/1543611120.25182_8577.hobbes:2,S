Hi Frank,
It can be NULL for kernel threads which do not have a user address
space. Nevertheless, their tsk->active_mm would not be NULL but point to
some process' address space.
The point of  having active_mm is to minimize TLB flushes on switching
address spaces when the task is scheduled out.
Regards,
Tigran
