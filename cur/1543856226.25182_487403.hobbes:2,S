| Ah, this actually makes sense.  The setfcaps usage() statement does
| 
| 	for (i=0; _cap_names[i]; i++) {
| 		printf...
| 
| so it expects _cap_names to end with a terminating NULL, but that
| doesn't seem to be the case in cap_names.h in libcap.
| 
| KaiGai, perhaps setfcaps should do something like
| 
| diff setfcaps.c.orig setfcaps.c
| 25c25
| <     for (i=0; _cap_names[i]; i++)

I brute-force hardcoded the limit on this for loop (i< 31), and rebuilt
Kaigai's tools, and retested (again, on this RHEL5 IA64 target.  It all
works now.  I ran through Chris Friedhoff's "test protocol", and it
went swimmingly (
http://www.friedhoff.org/fscaps.html
).
Then I went back to my SLES-10 IA64 target, and repeated the fixup for
Kaigai's tools.  It now works, providing I changeout the antique 
libcap.so.92 for newer libcap.so.10 (why the version number is lower is 
beyond me).
So, for my limited IA64 test target set, the following are true, 
providing Serge's capabilities kernel patch is applied, and Kaigai's 
userspace tools are utilized (obviously with the brute-force hack 
to setfcaps.c):
1) RHEL5 - libcap.so.10 is "stock":  
   caps patch and hacked u-space tools PASS the tests.
2) SLES10 - libcap.so.92 is "stock": 
   caps patch and hacked u-space tools FAIL the tests.
3) SLES10 - "stock" libcap.so.92 replaced with newer libcap.so.10: 
   caps patch and hacked u-space tools PASS the tests.
The question that remains unanswered: why is SLES using such an old
libcap, and are they likely to replace it with the more accepted
version (libcap.so.10) soon?
Thanks,
-Bill
