That may be the case, but there is a very clear problem with the vanilla 
scheduler that can cause too low priority for audio apps for up to 25 seconds 
after starting a new thread (eg new song). In turn they will skip madly when 
any higher priority task uses a burst of cpu and repeatedly preempts it (X, 
mozilla, the neighbour's dog...). Only the largest buffer audio cards wont 
skip with the vanilla scheduler, and _no_ amount of single cpu capability 
today is enough to avoid the scheduler based starvation. So while it never 
hurts to keep an eye on driver performance, the scheduler itself _must_ be 
fixed to prevent this happening.
