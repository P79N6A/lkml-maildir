Indeed.  You do not want an RSS limited process to get stuck
on an idle system, because nothing wants to free its memory.

Thanks to the swap cache, this should not be an issue.
You don't need to actually write the page to disk when removing
the page from the process RSS - you simply add it to the swap
cache, unmap it and move it to the far end of the inactive list,
where kswapd will run into it quickly if the system needs memory
again in the future.
