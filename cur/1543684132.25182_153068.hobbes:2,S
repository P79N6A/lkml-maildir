Hi,
the lspci output you previously sent confirmed that the SiS IDE driver 
does set the UDMA timings correctly. Given this is out of the suspects 
list, I'd advise to :
- test the hardware (uneasy on a notebook, 2.5" IDE drives aren't as 
common as 3.5" ones)
- try latest ACPI on sourceforge and enable ACPI in the BIOS if not 
already done (seems to have helped once :
