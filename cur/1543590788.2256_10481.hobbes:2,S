Hi All,
There is a nice feature (I saw it on 3Com EtherLink Server NIC cards)
called "TCP Segmentation Offload". Which means that the stack is presented 
with a larger MTU than eth, and the NIC produces smaller tcp segments.

I would like to hear your comments, weather this is something that can gain
real performance, and how to incorporate this into the Linux stack (At least
I didn't
see any references to it in kernel 2.4.(x<4)).
