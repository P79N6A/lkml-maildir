I'm a little unsure of how the timers play with sysfs suspend/resume, 
but calling do_settimeofday with irqs disabled is now clearly a bug.  
I'm thinking if these two cases don't fire under use, then we can safely 
down-convert the call sites.  Ingo, Thomas, what do you think of this 
(untested, unverified, patch attached):  is it true?

Yes, I recall non-linear control flow in the floppy and ide drivers that 
did this, and were odd, but correct under certain call conventions.  
Whether they remain correct or still exist should be worth revisiting.
I think at least in the timer code, we should preserve the same 
invariants across the two implementations of do_getttimeofday.  One uses 
write_seqlock_irq, the other write_seqlock_irqsave.  This confused me 
into thinking it was safe to call do_gettimeofday with irqs disabled (it 
used to be in 2.6.20).  But they both call clock_was_set, and thus 
on_each_cpu, so either both of them have a bug or they both can be 
reduced to irq instead of irqsave.  I'm guessing the latter is the case.
