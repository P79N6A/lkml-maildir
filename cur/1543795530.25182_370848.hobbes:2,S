Subject: mousedev parametes not visible in /sys

Hello,
linux-2.6.13/drivers/input/mousedev.c has some module_params, but they do 
not show up in /sys, i.e. there is no /sys/modules/mousedev directory at 
all. Even though it is a compiled-in 'module', I do know that even 
compiled-ins can get a directory under /sys/modules/, as is the case with 
a module_param in e.g. drivers/char/vt.c which shows as /sys/modules/vt.
Can anybody confirm this or know what's wrong?
