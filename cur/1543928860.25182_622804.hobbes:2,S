Because SFF ATA controller don't have IRQ pending bit.  You don't know
whether IRQ is raised or not.  Plus, accessing the status register which
clears pending IRQ can be very slow on PATA machines.  It has to go
through the PCI and ATA bus and come back.  So, unconditionally trying
to clear IRQ by accessing Status can incur noticeable overhead if the
IRQ is shared with devices which raise a lot of IRQs.
