Yes, but we'd need some more deterministic way of getting to that state.
Some kind of exponential rolling average of the time required to acquire
the semaphore in contention cases should be cheap to compute, and
relatively responsive to changing conditions.
In the case of a semaphore that becomes available during the spin phase,
the contention time is fairly easy to calculate; in the case that we
gave up and called schedule(), we need to know the time at which the
process actually woke up, rather than the time at which we returned from
schedule(), otherwise we'll overestimate the contention. Is there any
way of obtaining the time that wake_up() moved the current process on to
the run queue?
Jamie's idea of performing some of the work involved in the schedule()
whilst spinning ought to be worked into the design somehow if it's
practical.
