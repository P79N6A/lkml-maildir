No no, I want a change from "depends" to "select". That symbolises the
same dependency, but it has slightly different semantics (which it
probably shouldn't, but that's another discussion). With "depends", a
config entry is hidden if its dependencies aren't satisfied. With
"select", it will forcefully enable those dependencies.
From a user point of view, the former requires knowledge of how all of
these things hangs together (which is expecting a bit much), but the
latter will automatically pull in all the components needed to build the
option the user selects (which is how dependencies should work IMO).
