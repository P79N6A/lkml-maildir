Hi
I don´t know if it has been fixed in 2.4.0-test10-pre but on alpha
there´s a little mistake in inlude/asm-alpha/fcntl.h: 
#define F_LINUX_SPECIFIC_BASE 1024 
is missing. This prevents alpha from compiling. I added it till now
everything seems OK.
Do I need do make a patch or can someone fix it and "carry" it into the
tree... I´m not too experienced doing such things ...
Cheers Markus
