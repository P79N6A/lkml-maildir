Venkat, I think we should fix this by embedding the flow_cache_genid
bumps into selinux_netlbl_cache_invalidate() and
selnl_notify_policyload(), or something like that.
That way we don't have to pepper CONFIG_XFRM ifdefs all over
services.c
Any better ideas?  I'm actually surprised this code gets built
at all when CONFIG_XFRM is disabled to be honest.  :-)
