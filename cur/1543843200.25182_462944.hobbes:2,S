        RFC's are standards for protocols and are concerned with
interoperability among multiple implementations. They, in general,
do not define API's (and those that do are "informational").
        There are after-the-fact standards for sockets, including
POSIX, but older features are effectively defined by industry
practice; in this case, Deering's BSD implementation from nearly
20 years ago.
        Sections 7.1 & 7.2 of RFC 988 [Deering, 1986] hint at this
interpretation (separation of membership from socket delivery),
esp. when it says "Incoming multicast IP datagrams are
delivered to upper-layer protocol modules using the
same 'Receive IP' operation as normal, unicast
datagrams."
        But Deering's own implementation, which
does not distinguish which socket joined the group,
is the source of the standard practice.
