Yes, the _only_ point of the clear_page in the page fault path is
security.

Agreed. OTOH using a different chip for the bzero may really improve
performances and scale better.
The bzero-mania with a minimal slowdown under heavy load still doesn't
convince me instead...

Currently there's at least one page reserved that must stay zeroed all the
time. It's the ZERO_PAGE(). mapping /dev/null always fallback on the
ZERO_PAGE. you can read it as many times and whenever you want.
