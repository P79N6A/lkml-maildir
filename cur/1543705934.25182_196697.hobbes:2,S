What I'm struggling with when reading that POSIX draft is to
understand whether CLONE_FILES is appropriate or not for
pthread_create.
If this is unspecified, the f_pos issue becomes largely academic,
although one might argue that read() should behave either one
way or the other.
And no, luckily, I don't have a real-life application for this
either :-)
