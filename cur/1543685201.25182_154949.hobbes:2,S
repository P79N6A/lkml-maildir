 Step-A i486 processors are supposedly very rare and they were the
earliest ones (predating the DX suffix), so they were probably never used
for SMP systems.  And I think the i82489DX APIC was introduced a bit later
anyway -- we don't support non-APIC SMP implementations. 
 BTW, the step-A i486 reused opcodes of the famous i386's ibts and xbts
instructions.  Once the chips were out, Intel discovered there is actually
some software out there expecting ibts/xbts semantics with these opcodes,
so the encoding of cmpxchg was quickly changed. ;-)
