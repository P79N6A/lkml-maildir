well, causality means 'can another CPU observe something out of order'. It
doesnt matter _why_ the causality violation happens: wether it's due to
write reordering (which cannot happen), or read reordering. A Processor
Ordered memory model has both reads and writes ordered properly for all
observers (it can still do noncommitted internal reordering), in a
multiprocessor system.

yep, thats another type of causality violation, will try to generate a
testcase. [i think i have one, i'm checking it now]

yes, but nevertheless certain types of internal CPU structures are
cacheline sized, and if we want to see a higher parallelizm and a higher
chance of causality violation then i thought it's better if data is on
different cachelines. I agree that it shouldnt matter though from the
correctness point of view, both cases have to work and both might fail,
depending on the implemented memory model.
