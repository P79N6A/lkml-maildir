Or the case of BSD-style UIO implementing the readv() and writev() calls.
This may/may-not align perfectly so, address-length lists per page could
be helpful.
I did try an implementation of this for rawio and found that I had to
restrict the a-len lists coming in via the user iovecs to be aligned.

This would solve the issue with UIO, yes. Also, I think Martin Peterson
(mkp) had taken a stab at doing "clone-kiobufs" for LVM at some point.
Martin?
