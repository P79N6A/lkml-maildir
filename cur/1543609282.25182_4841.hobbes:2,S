I got a patch for the Elan's serial port from Jason Sodergren some days
ago, but it's not clear to me what exactly the problem is with this port.
I'm using the serial console on a DIL/Net-PC without any problems so far.
Perhaps it might be a good idea to join forces and try to get a patch for
the Elan series into the main kernel?
However, my current affords can be found on
  
http://www.schwebel.de/software/dnp/index_en.html
This currently implements a new CPU configuration parameter and a fix for
the clock on the Elan CPUs.
Robert
