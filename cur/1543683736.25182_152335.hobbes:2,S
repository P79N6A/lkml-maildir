from 'strace setterm -blank 0':
   write(1, "\33[9;0]", 6)                 = 6
which means you want to write the escape sequence to standard output (fd
1), or /dev/tty0 if your code is not attached to the current console. This
should be independent of any input devices that may or may not be there.
