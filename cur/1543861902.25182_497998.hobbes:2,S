loop-AES has some hacks which figure out the correct CC

No.
I was thinking that if TSO does not work at 100, why 1000 would be
any better.  But I can't test at 1000 speeds right now.
But if you say driver is supposed to hang at 100 speed,
I believe you.
Ohh... that was fast.

Yes.
I am subscribed to the mailing list.
That's why my email was not in Mail-Followup-To.
But if your thunderbird does not support Mail-Followup-To,
just ignore it.  I can add the header field manually.
