Cool. I'll change the other buses in init/main.c and post it.

Yes, next I'll be adding a common set of routines for BusDrivers,
including drive(), stop(), give_people_dirty_looks(), and swerve()...

A new bus? Sure, the bus driver just has to probe behind it.
USB can do it. The PCI probe routines are all declared __devinit, so if
you have hotplug support, you should be able to do it in theory. Greg?

Cardbus, Hotplug PCI, docking stations..
