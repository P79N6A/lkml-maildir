I modified my sycall table to put it in ".section .rodata". It appears
as though read-only is not enforced in the kernel. I don't know
why because, at least with ix86, both data and code can be made read-
only.
You just write to it with a segment descriptor that allows R/W, then
use another for R/O.  It is true that kernel code can create any
segment descriptor it wants, dynamically, thus a properly-written
program can ultimately write to what was once R/O data. However,
I think it should default to R/O which should cut down on the
number of cheap hacks that can damage it.
Cheers,
