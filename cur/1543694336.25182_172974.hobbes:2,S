The latest (*NON*bk) patch distributed by James appears to include your
new driver. The header from radeon_base.c  reads:
--8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<--

 *      TODO: - Bring a couple of cleanups from 2.4 to the mode setting code,
 *            - Split CRT vs. FP register calc/setting
 *            - Add CRTC2 support for mirror at least, dual head then
 *            - Add back some accel

#define RADEON_VERSION  "0.2.0"
--8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<--
Thus the rest of my previous message should be referred to
your new driver.

PS I am BK-handicapped. I had downloaded the program, and tried your
instruction as per an old message of yours, and no download would take
place. Since, if I recall correctly, bk cannot be used for free on
closed-source projects, I cannot switch to it (nor lose too much time
on it): I work on projects of both types, and changing every time
between RCS/CVS and bk would be very umcomfortable.
