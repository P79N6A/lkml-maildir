I suspect we would not need to treat mapped file backed memory any
different from page cache that's not mapped.  After all, if we do
proper use-once accounting, the working set will be on the active
list and other cache will be flushed out the inactive list quickly.
Also, the IO cost for mmapped data areas is the same as the IO
cost for unmapped files, so there's no IO reason to treat them
differently, either.
