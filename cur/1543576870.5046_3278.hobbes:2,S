Two examples: devices and bitmaps-in-pagecache trick. But both belong to
2.5, so...
BTW, nice timing ;-) -pre6 appeared 5 minutes after I've started testing
sane-s_lock patch (SMP-safe lock_super() and friends, refcount on superblocks,
death of mount_sem, beginning of SMP-safe super.c). Oh, well...
Oblock_super(): what the hell is wait_on_super() doing in fsync_file()?
It gives absolutely no warranties - ->write_super() can easily block, so
it looks very odd.
BTW, while we are dropping the junk from vm_operations_struct, could we lose
->protect() and ->wppage()? Both are never used and never defined. I can
send a diff, indeed, but
ed include/linux/mm.h <<EOF
g/\*protect/d
g/wppage/d
w
q
EOF
should take care of them.

It's nice to be back...
