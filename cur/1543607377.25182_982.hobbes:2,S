That is IMO bad behavior, it didn't use to do this because I have 
scripts that rely on this behavior.
I'll take it up with the author, Alexey.

Minor issue...if I create (using 'ip') two addresses on the same subnet on the
same device, one of them is primary and the other is secondary.  If I then
delete the primary address, the second one goes with it.
I submit that this is bad behaviour.
