Hi,
I've been working on a version of the DECnet for Linux patch for the 2.3.xx
series. I think I've got it just about correct, but I can't test it since
my test machine won't boot. It appears to be something to do with the new
wait queue stuff, maybe it only affects serial consoles...
On boot I get:
Partition check:                                                                
 hda: hda1 hda2                                                                 
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.                                   
Freeing unused kernel memory: 96k freed                                         
tty_io.c: process 1 (swapper) used obsolete /dev/cua0 - update software to use 0
bad magic 0 (should be c008c66c, creator 0), wq bug, forcing oops.              
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000    
followed by an oops like this....

I hope that will give someone enough of a clue to find the cause, if any
more info is required then please ask.
The DECnet patch will appear on the ftp site (ftp.sucs.swan.ac.uk) when
I can manage to get it tested further, its not really much changed from the
2.2.7 patch which is already there, its just a bit neater,
Steve.
