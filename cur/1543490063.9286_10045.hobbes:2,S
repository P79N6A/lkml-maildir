There is no connection between cache-size and the amount of memory it
can accomodate. Their is a connection between the chipset and the amount
of memory it can accomodate. All intel-slot7 chipset with the exception
of the HX chipset can only cache 64 Mb, and the HX only more if you
extend the tag-ram. non-intel-slot7 chipsets should be able to cache
more, but some may not be able to cache 256 Mb. Sometimes switching the
L2-cache to write-through instead of write-back will gain another factor
2 in the cacheable memory. If that doesn't help, I'm afraid a new
motherboard is due. Or use it as ramdisk/swap area.
Good luck,

True, said Morlock, especially in view of the powerful warship.
