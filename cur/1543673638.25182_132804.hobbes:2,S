Thanks, that is what I suspected.
There seemed to be quite a bit of interest in this from the other
customers, although our facility doesn't presently need this
functionality.  In the spirit of the "squeaky wheel", I'll squeak softly
for them.  
>From the above web page, thus quoth the RedHawk:
"In tightly-coupled symmetric multiprocessing systems such as
Concurrent’s iHawk real-time systems, RedHawk Linux allows individual
CPUs to be shielded from interrupt processing, daemons, bottom halves,
and other Linux tasks. Processor shielding provides a highly
deterministic execution environment where interrupt response is
guaranteed. RedHawk implements shielding via the industry-accepted
shield(1) command."
