Hi, Jens -
I'm having trouble reading a DVD or CD image from an ATAPI drive that
identifies itself as a 'LITEON DVD-ROM LTD163D'.  This is with vanilla
2.6.7 on a system running Fedora Core 2.
Regardless of what I do, I get the same errors:
        Jul 27 21:18:30 camp4 kernel: hdc: command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
        Jul 27 21:18:30 camp4 kernel: hdc: command error: error=0x54
        Jul 27 21:18:30 camp4 kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev hdc, sector 837264
        Jul 27 21:18:30 camp4 kernel: Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block 104658
I have ide-cd compiled as a module.  This occurs whether or not ide-cd
is loaded (I don't have ide-scsi enabled), and whether or not I have DMA
turned on.
I don't believe there is anything wrong with the drive, as it used to
work OK on 2.4, 2.5, and early 2.6 kernels, and I believe the media to
be fine, as the disk in question plays back on a Mac and a DVD player.
Googling for "error=0x54", I see a lot of reports of this kind of
problem, but never with any resolutions, so I'm stumped.  Is there any
information I can give you that would help?
Thanks,
	<b
