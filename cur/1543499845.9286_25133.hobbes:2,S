It doesn't need to interact. If you want volume-based mounting
(something I've said is fine by me), then that works with or without
devfs. I can see how you could use devfsd to provide a nicer interface
than raw UUIDs, but then again there are other ways of doing that to,
I assume. Either way, it doesn't matter, because it's easy to do in
user space.
Devfs still works when you don't have UUIDs, though, which is good
when you're configuring a system, or installing new hardware. And it
also works with location-based mounting, which is legitimate. People
shouldn't be forced to use UUIDs either. Read my other message about
providing choice. Devfs allows people to choose any part of the
configuration spectrum, from a static, disc-based /dev, through a
dynamic /dev and virtual /devices to a virtual /dev.
I don't care how people use it, just that they have the *choice* to
use it how they like.
