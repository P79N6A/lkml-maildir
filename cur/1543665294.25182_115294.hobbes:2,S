I (the original author) think it is cleaner to leave initialization and
registering of this kobject to the file system back end. For example,
there is no obvious generic way to generate names for such objects, etc.

Err. Not sure I understand. kobject representing file system instance
would probably have completely different set of attributes than
underlying partition object. Then, there are !FS_REQUIRES_DEV file
systems.
