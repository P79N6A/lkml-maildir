Tell him to plug a supported ethernet board into a PCI slot
and forget trying to get the embeded one working. It probably
isn't "turned on" by some secret incantations to some secret
registers. If you were to actually find out what was necessary
to make the board work, then that software won't work with a
regular SiS setup so nobody will put it into the kernel. The
usual problem with these imbeded boards is that the vendor
saved 18 US cents (actually) by not putting in the serial
EEPROM that enables I/O and sets the IEEE station address
(the MAC address). If you poke the correct registers, you
can get it turned ON, then what MAC address would you use?
Buried in some BAR somewhere is the MAC address. Forget it.
Get a real ethernet board. Been there, done that.
Cheers,
