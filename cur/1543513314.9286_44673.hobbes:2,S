Heh.  I knew it was wrong, i was asking if my interpretation was correct :)

Well, I default routed the last ip, so it worked for me on 2.2.10 and
before, so your fix was the direct cause of my setup not working, but the
masq code being broken is the real reason it's not working.  I guess I can
forgive you then. :)
Alright.  I can attempt to make a patch but I'd rather my kernel not catch
fire.  Perhaps the masq coders could look at it?  Pretty please? :)
Thanks
