Putting aside the point that we're talking code, not regular text, I've
heard that said before and I don't think it's quite like that.  Perhaps
the numbers you said might assume various things such as the width of
the eye's field of view, the distance to the image and the size of each
character?

The point is that the width, excluding leading and trailing white space,
is what really matters.  Even deeply indented code can be a snap to
understand if you don't have to fight artificial line breaks.  And we've
got a much wider -- and taller! -- space available than we had in the
old 80x24 (and 80x1) days.
