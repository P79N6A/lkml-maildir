In the README, you say :
	...
	The exec must be run as root because of the use of mlockall,
	sched_setscheduler, and sched_setaffinity calls. Sorry but
	there has been no attempt to use the Linux CAPABILITIES API
	so that it could be run as regular user.

It's false if you use the LSM patch from here :
