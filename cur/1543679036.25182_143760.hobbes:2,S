Kernel 2.5.73, first time I've used an external keyboard
When I plug my external Logitech keyboard into my laptop, (shared 
keyboard/mouse port), dmesg output indicates a generic mouse was 
attached instead of a keyboard.  The keyboard works, it's just the dmesg 
info that's inaccurate.
Keyboard plugged in:
input: PS/2 Generic Mouse on isa0060/serio1
Mouse plugged in:
input: PS/2 Logitech Mouse on isa0060/serio1
