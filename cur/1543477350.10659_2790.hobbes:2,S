/dev/hda (/dev/hda1 as /, /dev/hda2 as swap) is a WDC AC36400L
(6.4gig, FwRev=09.09M08, which is the model with the DMA problems that
came up in the middle of 2.1.x, and I've had DMA explicitly disabled
since then).
/dev/hdb (/dev/hdb1 as /var/scratch, /dev/hdb2 as /tmp, /dev/hdb3 as
more swap) is a QUANTUM BIGFOOT1280A (1.3gig, FwRev=A01.03).
/dev/hdc: Memorex CRW-1622, ATAPI CDROM drive } both using SCSI/ATAPI
/dev/hdd: NEC CD-ROM DRIVE:282, ATAPI CDROM   }  emulation
From the old /proc/pci, my IDE controller is:
  Bus  0, device   1, function  0:
    IDE interface: VIA Technologies VT 82C416MV (rev 4).
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  Master Capable.  Latency=32.
      I/O at 0x6000 [0x6001].
Curious thing -- on boot, I receive this printk():
PCI_IDE: unknown IDE controller on PCI bus 00      device 08, VID=1106, DID=1571
PCI_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs     later
Again, from the old /proc/pci, device 8 is my video card:
  Bus  0, device   8, function  0:
    VGA compatible controller: S3 Inc. ViRGE (rev 6).
      Medium devsel.  IRQ 11.  Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=4.Max Lat=255.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xf0000000 [0xf0000000].
I am using kmod, with 3c59x.o as the only loaded module at the time of
failure.  eth0: 3Com 3c905 Boomerang 100baseTx at 0x6100, 00:60:97:c6:9c:e2,
IRQ 9.

procps is actually version 1.2.9 -- I checked my source distribution,
just recompiled and reinstalled it.  Each program still reports 1.2.7
to a --version/-V.
I see that my libc isn't 5.4.46 as Documentation/Changes recommends --
I upgraded based on the 5.4.44 listed on www.linuxhq.com/change21.html
and now wonder if that could be related.
I just installed 5.4.46, and have been unable to reproduce this.  I
wasn't able to reproduce it at will before, though, it never failed
when I sat and watched it, but I would come home from work and it
would be rebooted.
My apologies if this was just a C library issue, sorry to take up the
time.  I'll get back tomorrow or the next day with a report on whether
or not it starts crashing again.
