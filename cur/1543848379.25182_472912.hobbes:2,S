Point taken and fixed. I missed that. I looked at calibrate and saw that 
there are no spaces :)

Removed the spaces, but the brackets are there for consistency with the 2d 
version and hdaps.

I don't want to lock it here, since the mouse polling kthread is heavy as it 
is.
I'd rather report a wrong value of mouse position while recalibrating.
The way I see it, if you're recalibrating your mouse, chances are you're not 
playing at the same precise millisecond. In my opinion it's worth more 
battery life.

Point taken and fixed.
I also found that I missed a comment in Kconfig after switching from proc to 
sysfs, but
I'll post the corrected version after I have more fixes to it.
Thanks for noticing.
