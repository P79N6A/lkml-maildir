Well, if you ask me, you should also treat bh_mask atomically (using
set_bit() & co). Otherwise it can get corrupted, as in your patch some
accesses to it are not protected by the spinlock.
I know that many people out there consider these problems too subtle,
but I can't help myself - I just tend to nail down every bug I spot
(err, I mean, the software ones :)
