It would allow creating an exported tree without interferance with
the local visible tree.  Note that the local visible tree isn't
global anymore either, and this allows to adjust what's exported
through nfsd throug a specific interface instead of needing to
get into nfsd namespace through some way.  Think of listing the
actually exported devices in /etc/exports instead of the indirection
through fstab aswell.
