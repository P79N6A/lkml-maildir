It's a limitation in scripts/Configure.
If you start with a .config with TSC enabled/required,
and just flip the CPU selection option to a TSC-less
CPU, like 386 or 486, then you end up with a .config
that _still_ has TSC enabled/required.
The workaround is to run 'make oldconfig' afterwards.
FWIW, both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels run Ok on my 486.
(My 486's Fedora user-space is another matter,
requiring kernel hacks for unconditional RDTSC
usage in RPM, but that's another issue.)
