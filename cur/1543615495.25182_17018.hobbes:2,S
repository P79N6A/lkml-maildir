I tried the 0.13 driver yesterday.  It appears to work fine, but when
I insert my Orinoco WaveLan card they system locks up.  I reverted to
the i810 audio driver included in kernel v2.4.16 and this problem
isn't encountered.
Is there a conflict with the orinoco and orinoco_cs drivers from
kernel v2.4.16?
