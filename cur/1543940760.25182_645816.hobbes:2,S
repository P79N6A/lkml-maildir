could you try the full patchset that Travis has just sent and which i've 
put into x86.git, you can pull it from:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git
it's a fixes only tree, ontop of Linus-very-latest. Head 4b9e425c25f84. 
[pull from ssh://master.kernel.org if it's not on git.kernel.org yet, 
uploaded it this very minute.]
