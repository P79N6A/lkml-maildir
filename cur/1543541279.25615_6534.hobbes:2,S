I think Redhat has done a stellar job of defending, supporting, developing
and distributing free (see GNU) software. I think they often wait for
three reasons:
(1) stability -- they don't want to update a lot of crap and break
everything too often
(2) licensing -- they support free software, particularly GPL software.
(3) standards -- they make minor kernel patches themselves, but typically
wait for a feature to be blessed before inclusing it, as opposed to
TurboLinux and SuSE.
