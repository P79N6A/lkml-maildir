this is what I remeber from Con's results too when he benchmarked my
first trees where I introduced the lowlatency elevator. I thought it was
the 4M queue that screwed stuff but clearly 4M is still way better than
2.4.21 stock. it's an exponential thing, I remeber very well, the huge
degradation from 2M to 4M, or at 1M for example the responsiveness is
istant an order of magnitude better than 2M. It's not a linear response.
So I thought the 4M thing hidden the benefits after reading Jens's
number, but it was quite surprising anyways since in 2.4.21 the queue is
way bigger than 4M anyways that puts all reads at the end with an huge
delay compared to pre5.

Agreed, something looked strange. Maybe it's some scsi/ide variable that
makes the difference, dunno. I tested this stuff on scsi IIRC though
(not that it should make any huge difference either ways though).

we definitely need many many more runs if the variance is so huge. And
it's not surprising it's so huge, the variable block allocation as well
plays a significant role.
