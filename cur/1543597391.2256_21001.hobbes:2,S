    The first technique is not sufficient with modern disk

So you write the number to the start and end of each sector, or, you
only assume sector-wide 'block-sizes' for integrity.
A 32-bit CRC is plenty cheap enough on modern CPUs and especially
considering how often you need to calculate it.
    Mohan has a clever technique that is computationally trivial and
    only uses one bit per sector:

    Unfortunately, it's also patented:

    Perhaps IBM will clarify their position with respect to free
    software and patents in the upcoming conference.
Wow... pretty neat, but fortunately not necessary.
