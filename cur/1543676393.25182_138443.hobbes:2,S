Hey All-
I don't know if this issue is really worth digging into, but it's an odd 
one, so I figured I'd post it:
I've been using RedHat's gcc-2.96-112 compiler, which is the most recent 
errata for RH7.2, to build my kernels. With all the recent kernels that 
I've built (every release from 2.4.20 to 2.4.21-rc7), the NFS client stack 
has been unstable. This comes in the form of either a hardlock or an oops 
under a specific load. Unfortunately, this load involves proprietary data, 
so we can't give it to the community to use. I haven't been able to crash 
the kernel using any synthetic load (fsx, bonnie++) so far.
I was able to fix this problem by reverting to redhat's gcc-2.96-98 
compiler, which I believe is the version that ships with RH7.2.
Hope this helps someone. I'm happy to answer any more questions pertaining 
to this.
-Matt
