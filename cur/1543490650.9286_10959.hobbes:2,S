Hi
For an Oracle Installation on Linux I need ver large Database Buffers.
The total buffer size is 
	 Database Buffers = db_block_buffers * db_block_size
in my case:
	 Database Buffers = 16000 * 8192 = 125 MB
If I set those values in initSLX.ora Oracle aborts with an error (Linux
Error).
The machine I am using has 1 GB RAM.
What and where I should change in the kernel to make Oracle works with
the desired values?
Thanks,
Anas
