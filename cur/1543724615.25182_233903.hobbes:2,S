I knew I was completely full of shit.
XFS does *not* zero files, it simply returns zeros for unwritten
extents.  If you open an existing file and scribble all over it, you
might see the old data during a crash, or the new data if it was
flushed.  You shouldn't see zero's though.
What does happen though, is that dotfiles are truncated and rewritten,
if the data blocks aren't flushed you will get zeros back because the
extents were unwritten.  This is really the only sensible thing to do
given the circumstances.
My guess is that with other fs' (when journaling metadata only) the
blocks allocated for the newly written data are *usually* the same as
the recently freed blocks from the truncate so things appear to work
but in reality it's probably mostly luck.  XFS could behave the same
way, but sooner or later you will still loose when you get crap back
instead of old data.
Some applications just need to be fixed.
