Bad example. The PC speaker driver does something which is fundamentally
ugly by design. It should be fixed to do something _different_. The OS
should not make it possible for PCSP to screw with the timers, the OS should
use the RTC for its own purposes, and leave the 8253 available for PCSP.
It's on my TODO list, and has been there for about three years now. If 
you're looking for something to cut your teeth on, I'll be _happy_ to give 
you some pointers :)
And in general response to your questions:

  is that 99% of OS theory is utter crud" -- Alan Cox
