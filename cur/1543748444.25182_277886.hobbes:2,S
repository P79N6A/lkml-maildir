Are you *sure* linuxrc isn't run at all?
You might want to run a test 'mkinitrd' and look at what FC3 expects to find
in there (yes, it generates a cpio archive, just extract it into a scratch
directory), then compare that to your initrd and see if you're missing something
(permissions, a directory, etc).
It's possible that the linuxrc is running, not outputting anything to the
console, and hitting an error that causes further progress to fail, making it
LOOK like it's not running at all.
