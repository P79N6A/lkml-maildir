... and yet you're perfectly happy to add the complexity of sticking half 
the code in userspace. I don't think I'll ever dare to try to understand 
you, Pavel :)

I think virtually everything is relevant to you. A couple of possible 
exceptions might be (1) freezing bdevs, because you don't care so much 
about making xfs really sync and really stop it's activity and (2) the 
ability to thaw kernel space without thawing userspace. I want this for 
eating memory, to avoid deadlocking against kjournald etc. I haven't 
checked carefully as to why you don't need it in vanilla.
Regards,
Nigel
