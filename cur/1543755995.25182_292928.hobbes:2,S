The code no longer is leaking devices.  I may be overlooking something, but I
think it still doesn't retain legacy probed devices when PnP isn't available.
If "pnp_register_driver" fails then "ns588_unregister_ports" will unregister
the correctly detected ISA ports.  "pnp_register_driver" will always fail if
pnp support isn't compiled into the kernel.  We need a way of not 
unregistering "ns558_pnp_driver" in "ns558_exit" but retaining the ports
detected by the legacy probe.  In a way, this is sort of a driver model
problem.
As a more general solution for all drivers, I've been thinking about doing
something like this in the long term.
int ret;
if (!(ret = register_driver(&ns558_driver)))
	return ret;
add_driver_protocol(&ns558_driver, &ns558_pnp);
add_driver_protocol(&ns558_driver, &ns558_isa);
and then on exit:
unregister_driver(&ns558_driver); /* this tears down any successfully
				     registered bus protocol automatically */
For now a less invasive solution might be better.
Comments?
Thanks,
Adam
