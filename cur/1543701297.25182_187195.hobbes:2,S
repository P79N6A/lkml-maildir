It's very useful, but some of the debugging options are literally _very_ 
intrusive, and can change usage patterns a lot.

The VM in 2.6.0 is pretty stable, but it hasn't gotten as much "tweaking" 
as the 2.4.x code. Which tends to show as bad performance under some 
loads.
The -mm code is likely to help a bit. I've been busy merging the stable
parts as Andrew sends it today and yesterday.
