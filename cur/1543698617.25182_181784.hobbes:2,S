Still, its a clue - all metadata I/O in XFS goes though the
pagebuf code, so we're looking in the right place.

Was your filesystem near full?  There was a 2.4 deadlock fixed
recently which could be what you hit there.

You'll want a more recent 2.4 XFS kernel I suspect - Steve made
several improvements in this area awhile back.

Sure does.

OK, looks like a default mkfs then (with an old-ish mkfs binary)?
Newer mkfs' will give you a better AG layout and unwritten extents
would be turned on - not relevent to this problem at all though.
An "ls -ld" and "xfs_bmap -v" on the directory would also provide
me a bit more info to work with -- thanks!
I have a few ideas about what this might be, let me stew on those
for a bit and try a few things.
cheers.
