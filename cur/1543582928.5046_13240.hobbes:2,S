This machine started as a Redhat linux 6.1 install some time ago, with lots 
of updates since then.
Prior to the kernel upgrade, I upgraded binutils to binutils-2.9.5.0.31-1,
modutils to modutils-2.4.2-1, e2fsprogs to e2fsprogs-1.19-0.
I've just installed kernel 2.4.2-ac1 from a clean build and I'm seeing the 
following at boot time:
hda: WDC AC31600H, ATA DISK drive
hdb: Maxtor 91303D6, ATA DISK drive
hdc: ST36450A, ATA DISK drive
hdd: CDA66801I, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: Disabling (U)DMA for WDC AC31600H
hda: 3173184 sectors (1625 MB) w/128KiB Cache, CHS=787/64/63
hdb: 25450992 sectors (13031 MB) w/512KiB Cache, CHS=25249/16/63, (U)DMA
hdc: 12594960 sectors (6449 MB) w/448KiB Cache, CHS=13328/15/63, DMA
hdd: ATAPI 6X CD-ROM drive, 240kB Cache
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.12
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 hda3
 hdb:hdb: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: dma_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
 hdb1 hdb2 hdb3 hdb4
 hdc: hdc1 hdc2 hdc3 hdc4
What does the disabling of DMA for the WDC drive mean, and can I re-enable it
with hdparm in a trouble free fashion?
What does this error during partition check mean and is it worriesome, or can 
I ignore it?
  
hdb:hdb: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: dma_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
thanks,
-chuck
