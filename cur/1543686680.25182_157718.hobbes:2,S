Ok, I'm just a little confused, because of this inversion of "high 
priority" with "low numbers".
First, am I correct in understanding that a lower number means a higher 
priority?
And for a higher priority, in addition to begin run before all tasks of 
lower priority, they also get a longer timeslice?
