That kernel version is ages old and, if it where a vanilla 2.4.9, maybe
one on the hardest to keep on working as expected in the 2.4.x series.
From the version number one can believe your kernel comes precompiled by
your vendor, and maybe you should contact it before anything else.
Upgrading the kernel to the latest available version provided by your
vendor, if at all possible, could also help a lot.
