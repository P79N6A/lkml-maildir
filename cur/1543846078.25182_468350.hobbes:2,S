I have a couple ATA drivers that spit out "foo might be used 
uninitialized" warnings.  Rather than the usual gcc nonsense, it turns 
out that the code follows this pattern:
	type_t foo;
	if (condition 1)
		foo = x;
	else if (condition 2)
		foo = y;
	else
		BUG();
It doesn't warn on other platforms, so I dug into the BUG() code on x86, 
and discovered that it is missing the 'noreturn' attribute found in 
other BUG() definitions.
Being rusty on the gcc asm syntax -- does an inline asm statement permit 
'noreturn'? -- I figured it would be best just to report this, rather 
than create a patch myself.
