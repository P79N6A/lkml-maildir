In that case, it's almost certainly that that tree isn't doing the proper 
"git update-server-info" when people push to it.
Chris/Greg: just add a
	hooks/post-update
file to your git repo that is executable, and just contains
	#!/bin/sh
	exec git-update-server-info
in it, and you'll be golden. It will mean that every time you push to the 
repo, it will run the "git update-server-info" thing after the push. And 
that will update all the necessary files for the stupid protocols (ie 
http) that don't know about git natively.
Oh, and run the "git-update-server-info" once by hand, just so that you 
don't then have to wait until after the next push for the git repo to be 
accessible by http://
www.kernel.org serves git repos fine, but the git repos have to help a bit 
at doing so.
What git update-server-info does is to create "info/refs" and 
"objects/info/packs" files that contain enough information for a client to 
figure out what refs and pack objects exist, so that they can try to fetch 
the necessary data on their own.
