hi all,
just upgraded to kernel 2.4.13... well, in any case i still get this 
message on 2.4.12 and ac patches after 2.4.12 as well....
just a question i don't know what it means... hdc is a dvd-rom drive i 
used to use scsi emulation on it and it seems on kernel 2.4.13... it 
crashes my box... couldn't log onto it from another machine to shutdown 
properly... by i mean crashes, X just freezes.. i'm tryind to omit the 
scsi-emu now and try it as a normal ide device and tune it with 
hdparm... still the same message...
Another thing, for dvd playing in linux. is it better to use hdparm or 
scsi-emu... i'm pretty new with dvd's in linux so i'm asking for a few 
pointers as well as kernel configuration options and such...
cheers all!
thanks!
cyrus
