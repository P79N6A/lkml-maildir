The new code doesnot pin the leaf nodes but still pins (by having an extra 
ref count will creation) the non-leaf nodes or directory dentry and inode. 
The non-directory (leaf nodes) dentry and inodes are freed as per the normal 
VFS/dcache cache eviction policies. Dentries not in use, will be pruned under 
memory pressure and eventually evict inodes also.

Extending this to directories introduces lots of race conditions in 
maintaining the coherancy between VFS dentry tree and sysfs_dirent
based tree. It could be doable but not without complications.
