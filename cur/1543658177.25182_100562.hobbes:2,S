I guess a question then might be this:  Andrea, I understand your stance
of needing to make a decent living and fund development.  I think Satch
has a point about the company going away (or the Bus problem... as in
something happens to you).  Is there any way you can feasibly (legal and
monetary concerns included) do a kind of code escrow so if such happens,
your code becomes GPL/BSD?  
BTW, I may be somewhat out of understanding here.  From what I have been
reading it seems the following is true:
1) Andre is making drivers for hardware or protocols
2) He is making them closed until he recoups his costs (I saw 18 mos
somewhere as the time needed...)
3) He then will open them up
If I am wrong, sorry, but this should say where I am seeing all this
from.
Also, I see the following...
1) The problem lies with him including kernel headers (I didn't think
magic numbers and such were really coverable by copyright... so unless
we are talking macros... where is the problem).
2) Interfaces are reverse engineer-able under US law for
interoperability purposes (DMCA may have muddied this)
3) The Interface calls (sys-calls etc.) are LGPL...
So where is the real problem here?
