You can find the raw data here:
http://samba.org/~anton/linux/pagecache/pagecache_data_gfp.gz
http://samba.org/~anton/linux/pagecache/pagecache_data_vmalloc.gz
You can see the average depth of the get_free_page hash is way too deep.
I agree there are a lot of pagecache pages (17GB in the gfp test and 21GB
in the vmalloc test), but we have to make use of the 32GB of RAM :)
I did some experimentation with prefetch and I dont think it will gain
you anything here. We need to issue the prefetch many cycles before
using the data which we cannot do when walking the chain.
