Here is the makefile I am using to create the .ko
object. Please notice that I compile my objects
by myself in a different makefile and only then
use the kbuild infrastructure. If kbuild is
adding the name as part of the module object
and not the header object then that might be
the problem. However, it is difficult for me
to use the kbuild infrastructure for the whole
build as it contains many files in different
directories.
makefile:
ifeq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
PWD		:= /home/idan/my_module
KDIR	:= /usr/src/linux-$(shell uname -r)/
default:
	$(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) modules
else
obj-m	:= my_module.o
my_module-objs := my_module_main.o
$(PWD)/my_module_main.o:
	echo do nothing
endif

For a start could you post the Makefile you use to build the module?
I assume you use the kbuild infrastructure?
