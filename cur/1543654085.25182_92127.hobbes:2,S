I can't think of any reason why the data- and bss-part of the kernel are 
influenced by a framepointer option, this seems highly illogical. It 
shouldn't make any difference as far as I can tell, maybe you altered 
other options as well? (Could be strange compilerbehaviour though)
Keith's results seem more reliable:
# size 2.4.20-rc2-*/vmlinux
    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
2669584  337972  402697 3410253  34094d 2.4.20-rc2-fp/vmlinux
2676919  337972  402697 3417588  3425f4 2.4.20-rc2-nofp/vmlinux
