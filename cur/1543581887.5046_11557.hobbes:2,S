Subject: [PATCH] sbpcd oops on merged requests
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/2/14/48

Two fixes here - 1st is to make the new max_drives its own separate
module parameter since the driver uses the existing sbpcd module
parameter internally for more than just module parameters <sigh>.
2nd is more important - if you read more than 4 blocks from the 
device, you will get a random crash - meaning you could mount a
cd and do "ls" and think it worked if that is all you did. Anything
more gets a rolling oops, EIP pointing off into outer space etc.
Tracked this down to the addition of the generic merge request
handling added to ll_rw_block in 2.3.41 (apparently nobody has
used this driver since then!!!) - it appears these conflict with
the molestation of the request list that sbpcd does from within.
Rather than attack sbpcd with a chainsaw, I went for the minimal
patch approach and simply disabled request merging.  Lets face it,
performance is not an issue if you are using a 2x speed CD with
seek times you measure with a wall calendar.
Patch is against 2.4.2-pre3.
Paul.
