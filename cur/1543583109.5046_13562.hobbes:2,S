Ok, I tried it, but it doesn't boot. It doesn't show errors during
init, but then it can't execute anything. The boot sequence stops with
"cannot exec modprobe...." repeated hundreds times.
Yes, modutils are the latest version.
(ASUS cur-dls, dual-833. It runs a Slackware 7.1 + some updates.
Kernel 2.4.2-SMP compiled with egcs-2.91.66.)
