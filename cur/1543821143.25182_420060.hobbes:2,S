I have tried compiling with APIC and ACPI support (in various
combinations) and neither make a noticeable difference.  I haven't
looked at the BIOS setting yet, though I don't remember seeing
anything like that (it's been a while though).

I tried it and it solved my problem.  However I appreciate that would
be a risky change for the reasons you mention.

Maybe.  But all the symptoms I have found are completely consistent
with them being edge triggered.  That's no proof of course....

The thing is: This is exactly what I am currently doing to solve the
problem.
I hacked my kernel to flip the '10' bit, and the problem went away.

I'll see what I can find, and report back if I find anything
interesting.
