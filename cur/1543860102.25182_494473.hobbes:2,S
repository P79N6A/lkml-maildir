Subject: [PATCH 10/28] V4L/DVB (4972): Dvb-core: fix bug in CRC-32 checking on 64-bit systems
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/27/103

From: Ang Way Chuang <wcang@nrg.cs.usm.my>
CRC-32 checking during ULE decapsulation always failed on x86_64 systems due
to the size of a variable used to store CRC. This bug was discovered on
Fedora Core 6 with kernel-2.6.18-1.2849. The i386 counterpart has no such
problem. This patch has been tested on 64-bit system as well as 32-bit system.
