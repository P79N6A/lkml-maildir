The trivial case is the cachehit case. Everything flows like usual since 
we don't swap threads.
If we're going to sleep, __async_schedule has to save/copy (depending if 
TS_USEDFPU is set) the current FPU state to the newly selected service 
thread (return-to-userspace thread).
When a fault eventually happen in the new userspace thread, context is 
restored.
