As pointed by Viro on IRC, there are other places where we access/use 
mnt_parent without any protection. IIUC this needs either vfsmount_lock or the
namespace sem for protection. I did audit such places and hope not missed
anything else.
One such place is in autofs4's is_vfsmnt_tree_busy() routine. I hope Ian still 
has the expire patch which corrects it. Didn't know why this patch never hit
lkml.
IMO do_kern_mount() probably don't need any protection for mnt_parent as it is 
still initializing the vfsmount struct.
The other remaining place is m68k/atari/stram.c:swap_init() where it is
initializing a static vfsmount struct, so again IMO no lock required here.
Thanks,
Maneesh
