It depends. Obviously if you disconnect your hard drive, the writes
will fail with a time-out. But they fail after a number of retries
(it depends upon the type of disk and its driver). So, if you
"force" a timeout by disconnecting a drive, you don't have
the same situtation as a normally failed write.
Disk/file writes go like this (assuming no sync() or fsync()).
(1)  File data gets flushed to a queue.
(2)  When the queue gets nearly full, based upon a LRU mechanism,
      data are written to the disk.
(3)  If the disk-write fails, the driver retries the write.
(4)  If the write continues to fail, i.e., timeout, no disk, etc.
      the kernel gives up and does not hang forever. If you have
      disconnected the drive, you won't have any syslog writes to
      the device so your next boot won't show the event. It looks
      as though it was ignored.
You can observe the behavior by mounting a floppy disk and
then removing it while it is being written. There are many
attempts to write to the device and then that write is discarded.
Cheers,
