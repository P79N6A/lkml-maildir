I really hate adding overhead to gettimeofday() and we would have to take 
the seqlock in all places when we reference tz. Maybe we can tolerate the 
resulting race?
If we assume word size transfers then we only have an issue on 32 bit 
platforms. The result of the race would be that tz_minuteswest and 
tz_dsttime disagree. So we may get daylight savings time wrong.
But then we are already changing the timezone and are potentially warping time.
gettimofday may be unstable anyways. So it may be okay to leave the race 
in. Just add some comments explaining the situation.
