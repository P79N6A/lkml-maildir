Simple. Not _your_ functions, but the functions returned by the
routing table lookung and the neighbour state machine. Trying
to muck with dst->output is recipe for desaster

It is easy to blame the kernel stack of course. Although there are bugs,
you should be aware that about 80% of the reports are caused
because the users use some equipment that can't deal with the new 
SACK/timestamp/window scaling TCP options.

So when one fragment gets dropped the whole packet is lost ? This is the
"NFS trap" and works badly over WANs, because you would disturb path
MTU discovery. It is important that packets with DF get a icmp error
when they exceed the effective size of the tunnel.

skb->truesize is broken in 2.2 (it should contains sizeof(sk_buff) but
it does not ATM). Why are you using that anyways?  You should use 
skb->len.

Why is another routing table lookup unreliable? For me it seems to 
be the cleanest way (e.g. ip_gre does it too). I don't know what you 
mean with route stealing. Trying to play your own games with the dst
is not a good idea, see the dst as encapsulated object you shouldn't
touch.
