Its called under lock yes.
The problem with this fix is that we currently have the requirement that 
the rmap invalidate_all call requires the pagelock to be held. That is not 
the case here. So I used _begin/_end to skirt the issue.
If you do not need the Pagelock to be held (it holds off modifications on 
the page!) then we are fine.
