[ Intel's driver as in 2.6.5 -

 ]
    I'm looking into e1000 driver in irq handling and what I see, 
puzzles me.
    Functions e1000_clean_{t,r}x_irq are very similar: both of them are 
checking descriptor flag updated by nic.
    Host CPU, obviously, to perform this check, will cache descriptor.
    If, say e1000_clean_rx_irq() will be called twice in short time 
range, I expect that it can miss change of the flag, since old flag may 
still sit in host CPU cache.
    Am I missing something here?
