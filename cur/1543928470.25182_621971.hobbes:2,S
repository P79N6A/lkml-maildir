well it's quite broken at the moment and we are looking for solutions 
not for a blame game :-) You might have read the thread where i describe 
what i had to go through to do something fairly trivial.

in Linux we never truly had a notion of "process" when your change was 
done - "process" always meant the task itself. That's why all the 
task_struct parameters/variables used to be named 'p', not 't'. So when 
NTPL came around this became a poorly defined notion.

this sounds good to me. If it's a symlink then there's not much other 
choice because the thread PIDs do not even show up under /proc anymore.

agreed.

sound, future-proof API design, with a little bit of foresight? I am 
faced with incidents on an almost daily basis that show how much we 
kernel folks suck at defining new APIs. The only luck is that the set of 
system calls is fairly complete already - but in the rare case where we 
touch an API it's a catastrophy most of the time. With such an API track 
record we'd probably never survive as a user-space project.
