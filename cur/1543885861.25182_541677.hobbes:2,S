On boot, it takes a while until USB disks are detected, and before this
the kernel may have already reached the RAID autodetection stage (in
which case RAID arrays from USB storage will not be detected at all),
and may even have tried mounting the root, causing kernel panic if the
root partition was supposed to be on a USB disk.
Is there any good workaround for this besides using initrd? Or are there
plans on fixing it (perhaps make RAID autodetection and root mounting
wait for USB scanning to finish)?
