I'd like to see a directory in the root of the kernel tree having the
name of the kernel version.  Any patch that breaks things writes a one
or two line file into that directory.  When it's time to release a
kernel version you do the following:
  cat 2.4.0-testX/* >>Documentation/Changes
  rm -rf 2.4.0-testX
Forgetting to do this rollup is ok, it doesn't hurt anything. 
Forgetting to include the change log entry in the patch is ok too -
it's not any worse than the current situation.
This approach gives us a way of annotating the important effects of
patches that are actually applied.
I can think of various arguments for not doing this or something like
it, but the only substantive one I can think of is 'no, it would make
it easier to work with the kernel', and I guess this is the argument
that will be applied in this case.  Disclaimer: I don't mind, in fact
being an elitist is kind of fun.
