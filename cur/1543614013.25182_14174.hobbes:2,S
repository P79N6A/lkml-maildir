It depends. If you've two CPU and these two tasks are the only ones
running, yes running them on separate CPUs is ok because the parallelism
that you'll get is going to pay you back for the cache issues.
And this is the automatic bahavior that you'll get with sane schedulers.
But as a general rule, matching MMs should lead to a tentative to run them
on the same CPU ( give preference, not force ).
