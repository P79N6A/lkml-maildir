How can one tamper (write) the kernel memory of a booted and running kernel
without using an exploitable bug?
I mean, you can't mess with the bzImage on flash, the secure bootloader 
boots it without
letting someone alter the (non crypto-) memory while loading the bzImage 
on it, and then
no-one can run something that will tamper the system or write anywhere 
on kernel memory
without exploiting a bug
I mean, am i missing something here?
