Segher, can you please drop out of this discussion?
Your points are all wrong.
The inline asm version has the EXACT SAME PROBLEM as the "volatile" 
version has: it means that the compiler is unable to combine trivial 
instructions. There's no way that is acceptable.
So why the *hell* you'd expect the asm version to be smaller, I can't 
imagine. It's obvkously not going to be true.
So here's a clue to everybody in this thread:
   THE CURRENT x86 BEHAVIOUR IS THE CORRECT ONE
where we don't have any "volatile" and no inline asm and no barriers, and 
we let the compiler do the right thing. If the code needs barriers, the 
code should damn well add them.
It's worked for the past 8 months, on the most common platform there is.
Stop this *idiotic* thread already.
