But we cant use X86_PC since it uses logical flat mode for IPI's that could 
cause hangup's if we deliver IPI's using IPI broadcast shortcut.
In i386 we do have an alternate that would use mask value to deliver IPI's
but Andi's recommendataion was to use flat physical mode just like what we
do for X86_64.
Other than the IPI mode, are there any other things that hurt small systems
by choosing bigsmp mode?
Venki suggested we could make it !X86_PC instead of listing 
GENERICARCH or BIGSMP separately.

When CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is turned on we always use physflat mode (bigsmp) even 
when #of CPUs are less than 8 to avoid sending IPI to offline processors.
Without having BIGSMP on it spits out a warning during boot on systems that
seems misleading, since it complains even on systems that have less
than 8 cpus.
