 Why to code complicated workarounds for broken firmware?  It's so easy to
fix, so either bother the vendor for a fix or replace the system with a
sane one.  Reading and understanding the Intel's MP spec is a day or at
most two worth of man's work.  I wouldn't trust the vendor that refuses to
invest in a product even that little.
