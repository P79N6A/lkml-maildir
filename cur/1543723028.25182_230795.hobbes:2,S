About 13 years ago I wrote a data analysis program for an NMR spectrometer
that stored its output as 24-bit integers!  Yes, one does encounter weird
things from time to time.  Still, having the functions I mentioned would 
be very handy in the majority of cases.  They remove several 
possibilities for error (getting the bit shifts wrong, getting the array 
indexes wrong, associating the right bit shift with the wrong index).

Andries too.
