Due to the issue described here (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/21/61
),
any system based on EFI may have issues with their bootloader. As the boot
partition is FAT32 any alteration of files in the EFI partition will
effectively delete them and the machine will need to be recovered via
CD or by booting over the network.
