 I see exactly the same (broken!) behaviour here. The last kernel
that
works for me in 2.4.4-ac6, which I'm running at the moment. All
subsequent -ac kernels and 2.4.5-pre4 and above are broken. I
reported
the bug last week. Quick system summary: RH7.1, Duron, KT133, Network
card chip "Digital 21041-AA". I get the same problem as above
(working
kernels set half-duplex, broken kernels set full-duplex). More
details

  Thanks!
