And to make it clear: this is not a theoretical worry. It happened many 
times over the months the unwinder was in. 
It was supposed to help debugging, but it made bugs that *would* have been 
nicely debuggable without it into nightmares. So the only reason for it 
existing in the first place was actually the thing that made it not work.
