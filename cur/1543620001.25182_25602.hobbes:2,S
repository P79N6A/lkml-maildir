I cannot quote a source, but I have heard people say Posix - or some
other standard, all I can find on google is people saying read is
atomic wrt to write, but there is no definition of writes wrt other
writes.

No you are not, I did not say it was totally coherent, at the start of
the direct I/O the caches are made coherent, they can drift apart during
the operation if buffered or mmapped I/O is ongoing during the operation,
and yes those blocks are stale in the cache.
In normal life people do not seem to mix direct I/O and other forms of
I/O in parallel.
If you want full coherency you have to lock out page faults and buffered
I/O during direct I/O. You also need to deadlock avoidance code for the
case where someone does this:
	fd = open("file", O_DIRECT|O_RDWR);
	mem = mmap(&addr, 40960, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 20480);
	read(fd, mem, 32768);
