Thanks Zwane, everything's working now. I guess I should have upgraded when I 
read the announcement.
On the ACPI front, both standby and mem seem to work (S1 and S3 I assume), in 
that they suspend, and now resume, but my SATA controller and NIC do not seem 
to wake up properly. Since my rootfs is on the SATA controller, things 
quickly hang thereafter.
Oh well.
