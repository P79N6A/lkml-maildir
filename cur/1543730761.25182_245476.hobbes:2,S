"OMG! It breaks tar and email!!!" argument doesn't fly. Things break all
the time and are fixed. It's called progress.
cp, grep, cat, and tar will continue to work just fine on files with
multiple streams.
tar and cp will lose the extra streams until somebody fixes them, but
they lose ACLs and xattrs right now, and I don't hear anybody suggesting
that ACLs and xattrs be removed from the kernel because of this.
Fixing programs that do recursive filesystem traversals is a matter of a
glibc patch to nftw(3) and a modification to their option processing.
Holding back a useful feature because you don't want to upgrade
coreutils is just plain dumb.
(BTW, for email, multipart/parallel is a start, but a specific multipart
content type for multi-stream file attachments would probably be more
appropriate.)
