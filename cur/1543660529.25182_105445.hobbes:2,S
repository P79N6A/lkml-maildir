ok, since I recieved no response from first try here goes more info:
I am using a thinkpad 760ED and I have tried puting APCI code in my kernel 
but it appears my laptop does not support it.  The problem appears to be in 
the PCMCIA-CardBus bridge not being able to assign an IRQ.
I am uncertain if this is in the yenta driver code or in the PCI systems 
code. so I do not know who to even ask for direct assistance in correcting 
the problem.
I have heard the yenta driver is linus' but I do not know if the problem is 
before it loads or during.  any assistance would be appreciated.
