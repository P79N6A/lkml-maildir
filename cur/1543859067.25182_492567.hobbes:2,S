I agree it's fishy and I did think about it. The design isn't exactly
the prettiest, but it should be safe. The reason is that we don't
actually unlink the individual bio from the list, even if we may set
rq->bio to point somewhere further into the list. So as long as the bio
is valid, the bi_next field is still valid as well. We need a reference
on the bio to perform the unmap and blk_rq_unmap_user() drops this
reference on its own, so the bio must be valid.
Taking a rq pointer when we really want a bio is nasty, though. I'll
chance that at least.

I'm not so sure it's that patch, the same problem seemed to exist for
some people prior to 2.6.20.
