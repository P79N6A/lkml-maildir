I am aware of that point and noted to all parties prior to the full 
release of 2.2.0-pre8. Both the Jan 15 pre8.bz2 and Jan 17 pre8.gz
put the wammie on the ide-floppy.
Since it is a compiler issue, the UGLY patch was to get it running until
the strstr() was resolved.  The solution at had is to do a C-style strstr
call from the kernel's internal lib functions.
