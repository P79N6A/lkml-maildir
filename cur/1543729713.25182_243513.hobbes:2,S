But that complicates the parser. Current the hotplug agent script reads
the simple modules.foomap and generates a list of possible drivers. Then
it looks into the blacklist file to see if one of the possible modules
should not be loaded, and skips this module.
Is there such functionality for the modules.alias file in
module-init-tools? I played around with modprobe -n, but could not
figure it out. Unfortunately, some hardware has more than one driver.
bcm5700/tg3, eepro100/e100 and maybe more.
