(This is a repost of a mail I made just before vger went
offline. My apoligies to Linus and Martin Mares for mailing
this twice to them, but any comments should be received
by all.)
Hi.
(This has mostly been discussed in an earlier thread. This is a
follow-up with some extra added.)
There currently is a mismatch between the documentation for the
config option CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS and the code it describes. The
help text states that if 'any' (CONFIG_PCI_GOANY) is picked,
linux will first probe for PCI devices directly, falling back to
asking the BIOS if direct access fails. In reality, the code
tries both (first BIOS then directly) and keeps the direct access
results (if valid) or else uses the BIOS results (if valid).
I discussed this mismatch with Martin Mares at a time when I
thought that the code should be changed to do as the help text
stated (because that made my machine boot :) ), and he wrote:
> Some years ago, the PCI routines have really used this strategy

AFAICS the current code does not follow this line of thought
completely, as it still probes the hw directly after asking the
BIOS, even though the BIOS might have returned valid data.
So I propose the following patch (patch 1) that changes the code
to check the BIOS results before probing directly and changes the
documentation to reflect this.
If this is rejected for some reason, I include a patch 2 that
merely changes the Documentation/Configure.help to reflect how
the code works currently.
Please comment.
