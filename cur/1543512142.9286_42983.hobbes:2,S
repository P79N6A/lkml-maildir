Yes, all the patches as described in the README/INSTALL. Some are for
2.2.7 but apply clean, some are newer. The names are a bit confusing, but
give them a try.
Without the patches knfsd is not supposed to work!

Yes - nfsd is the kernel thread that runs on the code in the nfsd module.
Better put: you load the module and the kernel will spin some threads
providing the service. 
You must recompile the kernel and modules after patching, and reboot. It's
worth it.
