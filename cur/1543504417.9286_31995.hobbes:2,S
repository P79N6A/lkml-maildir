I think you must be mistaken; by default Linux supports 3GB of virtual
memory and 1GB (- epsilon = 960MB, iirc) of physical RAM.  It's possible
to change that to 2GB + 2GB, but it isn't possible to get 4GB of linear
addressed space on x86.  If you need that, get an Alpha.
Even the proposed 36-bit extensions won't allow this -- they merely allow
the system to keep around many more anonymous pages which you can't use
directly.  Fortunately, this is exactly what big databases want.
