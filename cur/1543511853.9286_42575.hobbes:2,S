This is a known issue.  Not all biosen that do not support e820 have
predictable behavior when this function is called.  If your bios does not
support ACPI, STANDARD_MEMORY_BIOS_CALL needs to be defined for
arch/i386/boot/setup.S  Grepping source, I don't see a config option to do
so.  Linux/config.h should do, however.
There is an effort undway to make these routines more bullet proof.  Part of
the solution may be to turn off ACPI support for any non-MMX cpu.
