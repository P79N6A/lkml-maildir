Hello!
>  Im my case P-MTU discovery
Sorry, I lied. Not pmtu discovery but exaclty opposite effect
is important here: collapsing of small frames to larger ones.
Each such merge results in loss of 1 "sack" in 2.2.

Good. 8)

Exactly.

Well, you can reinvestigate this to get more reliable results...
Actually, this problem is so difficult that the study would be purely
academical; there is no hope to fix it in 2.2. It is partially
repaired during 2.3 and completely resolved only in 2.4.4.

There is no real danger. Bad things can happen only when receiver does not
read data for very long time, in this case connection times out not
receiving any acks.
What's about minimum/maximum mtu... it does not exist. F.e. if sender floods
1 byte frames in TCP_NODELAY mode and receiver does not read them, 2.2 will
fail not depending on mtu. See? Even 40 bytes of IP+TCP headers (not counting
for additional overhead) guarantee that memory will exhaust by order earlier
than receiver can close window.
