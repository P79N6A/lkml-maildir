Yes, this is perfectly normal. A heavily swapping machine
will swap out parts of X.
Now, if X has a need for low-latency for keyboard handling,
then the X developers can use mlock to lock
the X keyboard service in memory, and make it a real-time
(or at least high priority) process too.  This should
avoid the problem even with extreme swapping and/or
high cpu load.

Seems ou use too much memory then. If xjed
wastes memory (by bringing the entire file into memory
in one go) then you'll get some swapping.

No such law, but there are badly implemented software
around. If xjed is capable of delaying all X events while
loading the file, for example . . .
