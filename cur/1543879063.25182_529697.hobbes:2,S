But if a filesystem can't or the developer thinks that it shouldn't for
some reason, support bind/move mounts then there should be a way for the
filesystem to tell the kernel that.
Surely a filesystem is in a good position to be able to decide if a
mount request "for it" should be allowed to continue based on it's "own
situation and capabilities".
