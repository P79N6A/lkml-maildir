Hmm.. You're right. We only actually need it for the unconditional bitops, 
like the *unlock* side.
IOW, if you do a spinlock with the bitops, the locking side should be able 
to use a "test_and_set_bit()" on its own, but the unlocking side should be
	smp_mb__before_clear_bit();
	clear_bit();
because the ones that don't return a value also don't imply a memory 
barrier.
