I understand that :)
(and if 2.6.y+1-preX appeared before 2.6.y then that wouldn't be too 
confusing)
(neither would 2.6.y.1 as an 'oops' in the human sense)
--Joe User.
Who's scared to risk his personally valuable data on a 
2.6.x-pre<anything> - but will install, lets see, hmm, -rc2 or above :)
(I suppose the more paranoid I get, the higher the watermark I set on -rcX)
(I'm lying since I'm running a -mm on my server but that's only because 
I helped track down an XFS/nfsd bug!)
