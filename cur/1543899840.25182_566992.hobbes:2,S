If we admit that the pid_ns->proc_mnt pointer can change from NULL
to some valid mount, then we should track all the possible races
with its dereference in the code. We have already caught one of 
such "tricky" places with Suka's patches and sent the OOPs to him.
My opinion is that having kern_mount-ed proc makes no discomfort but
protects from all the possible races with this pointer dereferencing.
Thanks,
