With a 64k page and a dma boundary of 0x7fff, that's two segments.

That's just the size in sectors limitation again. And that also needs to
be handled, the fact that it currently errors out is reassuring but
definitely a long term solution. You don't want to knowingly setup such
a system where the fs block size is larger than what the hardware would
want, but it should work. You could be moving hardware around, for
recovery or otherwise.

And how large can that be?
