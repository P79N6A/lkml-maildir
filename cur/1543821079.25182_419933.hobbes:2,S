Sorry, I think there is no generic memory hotplug agent now.
I do it by hand or handmaid scripts.
(Just because our target, NUMA-node-hotplug, is now under construction.)
In theory, ACPI namespace notifier calls memory hotplug agent and it just does
%echo online > /sys/devices/system/memory/memoryXXX/state.
After this, new memory is available.
This page has a bit more information.

BTW, could you teach me pointers to kexec/kload tools ?
