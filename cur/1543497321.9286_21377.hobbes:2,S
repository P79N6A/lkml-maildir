Hi,
  maybe that it is more problem with ncpfs_nopage. It is legal for
*_read filesystem procedure to return with 0 at the end of file (I think,
it is normal behavior for read syscall).
  Unfortunately, I do not have access to sources at this moment. But I
changed nopage procedure for 2.2.10-pre1 / 2.3.4 due to possible deadlock.
Maybe I changed this too when walking through code :-)
                                        Best regards,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
