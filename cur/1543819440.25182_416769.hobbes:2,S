Perhaps the SELinux model should be extended to handle (dir-inode,  
path-entry) pairs.  For example, if I want to protect the /etc/shadow  
file regardless of what tool is used to safely modify it, I would set  
up security as follows:
o  Protect the "/" and "/etc" directory inodes as usual under SELinux  
(with attributes on directory inodes).
o  Create pairs with (etc_inode,"shadow") and (etc_inode,"gshadow")  
and apply security attributes to those potentially nonexistent pairs.
I'm not terribly familiar with the exact internal semantics of  
SELinux, but that should provide a 90% solution (it fixes bind mounts  
and namespaces).  The remaining 2 issues are hardlinks and fd- 
passing.  For hardlinks you don't care about other links to that  
data, you're concerned with protecting a particular filesystem  
location, not particular contents, so you just need to prevent _new_  
hardlinks to a protected (dir_inode, path_elem) pair, which doesn't  
seem very hard.  For fd-passing, I don't know what to do.  Perhaps  
nothing.
Anyways, just a few ideas for consideration
Cheers,
