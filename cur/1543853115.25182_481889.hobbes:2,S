I remember something actually did "won the approval". Don't remember
the details but I think it included conditional compilation, not
changing CONFIG_* macros (using different name(s) instead, just not
starting with "CONFIG_"), and IIRC no changes to Kconfigs.
At least I don't remember any objections to that last version so
I assumed it's closed.
Perhaps it was just a dream, who knows :-)
Nevertheless a fix outlined above would be acceptable, wouldn't it?
