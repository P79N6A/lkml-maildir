there is no "spec" on how it should be done. Again, it is about security and
"doing it as right as possible" and not "according to POSICKS we can do
whatever we want".
Just necause some standard says we needn't does not mean that we could do
it better.

It is possible to get "good enough" semantics with the
special-marked-library solution (I think), but I also fear this solution
will be quite fragile in practise (because I dislike concepts like
setuid-libraries since they scored very low in history).
