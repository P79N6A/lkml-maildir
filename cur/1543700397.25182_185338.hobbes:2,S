I agree, they look like synonyms.
There's nothing about "enable" in Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
and there's evidence in zconf.l (as you mention) and in menu.c
that they are the same:
			case P_SELECT:
				sym2 = prop_get_symbol(prop);
				if ((sym->type != S_BOOLEAN && sym->type != S_TRISTATE) ||
				    (sym2->type != S_BOOLEAN && sym2->type != S_TRISTATE))
					fprintf(stderr, "%s:%d:warning: enable is only allowed with boolean and tristate symbols\n",
