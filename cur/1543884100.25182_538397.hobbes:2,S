Yes - disabling notify_on_release would definitely break some important
uses of cpusets.  This feature must be reactivated somehow before I'll
sign up for putting this patch set in the main line.
Actually, after I posted a few days ago in another lkml post:
	
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/29/66
that just the simplest cpuset command:
	mount -t cpuset cpuset /dev/cpuset
	mkdir /dev/cpuset/foo
	echo 0 > /dev/cpuset/foo/mems
caused an immediate kernel deadlock (Srivatsa has proposed a fix), it
is pretty clear that this container patch set is not getting the cpuset
testing it will need for acceptance.  That's partly my fault.
The batch scheduler folks, such as the variants of PBS, LSF and SGE are
major user of cpusets on NUMA hardware.
This container based replacement for cpusets isn't ready for the main
line until at least one of those schedulers can run through one of
their test suites.  I hesitate to even acknowledge this, as I might be
the only person in a position to make this happen, and my time
available to contribute to this patch set has been less than I would
like.
But if it looks like we have all the pieces in place to base cpusets
on containers, with no known regressions in cpuset capability, then
we must find a way to ensure that one of these batch schedulers, using
cpusets on a NUMA box, still works.
