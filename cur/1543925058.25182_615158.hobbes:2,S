kmem_cache_defrag returns the number of pages that were released by defrag 
actions.
shrink_slab returns the number of objects released by the shrinkers. 
kmem_cache_defrag has no way of knowing how many objects where released by 
the kick methods. The kick method may have chosen to reallocate the 
object.
