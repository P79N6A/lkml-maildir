Ok, I will proceed that way then. I see at least two places in binfmt_elf :
   631                  if ((interpreter_type & INTERPRETER_ELF) &&
   632                       interpreter_type != INTERPRETER_ELF) {
   633                          // FIXME - ratelimit this before re-enabling
   634                          // printk(KERN_WARNING "ELF: Ambiguous type, using ELF\n");
   635                          interpreter_type = INTERPRETER_ELF;
   636                  }
   824                  if (BAD_ADDR(elf_entry)) {
   825                          printk(KERN_ERR "Unable to load interpreter %.128s\n",
   826                                  elf_interpreter);
   827                          force_sig(SIGSEGV, current);
   828                          retval = IS_ERR((void *)elf_entry) ? PTR_ERR((void *)elf_entry) : -ENOEXEC;
   829                          goto out_free_dentry;
   830                  }
The first one might be interesting, while the second one should definitely
be ratelimited or removed.
Thanks,
willy
