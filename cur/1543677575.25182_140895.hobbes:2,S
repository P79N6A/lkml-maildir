The question of which references should pin a module is a design decision 
that I prefer to leave to others.  But I would think that a reference the 
module can quickly and easily revoke probably shouldn't pin it, whereas 
one the module isn't even aware of probably should.
That's the difference between the example you gave and the problem I
cited.  In your example, the fact that your program parked its cwd in a
sysfs directory would force the reference count of the corresponding
kobject to be nonzero.  That the module was willing to deallocate the
kobject and exit even though the reference count was still positive is a
simple programming error.  But in the situation I described, the design of
the driver model makes it impossible for a driver to know whether any user
processes still have references to a device attribute file after
device_remove_file() has been called.
