Not being familiar with the code, I was specifically trying to preserve 
the old semantics and only address the use-after-free issue. So if there 
was another bug... well, I guess I succeeded at preserving it ;)

There's a side effect to this change: by unconditionally overwriting err 
we lose the original error code. Then if we're exceeding the number of 
retries we'll end up returning 0 which is probably not what you want.
Return code aside, it seems the only thing ubi_scan_add_to_list() is 
doing is allocate a new struct ubi_scan_leb, initialize some fields with 
values passed from new_seb and then add it to the desired list. But 
copying new_seb to a newly allocated structure and then immediately 
freeing the old one seems redundant - why not just add new_seb to the 
corrupted list and be done? Then we don't have to deal with allocation 
failures in an error path anymore - something like this (diff against 
the original code):
