This is good, I like this.

This is not good, I don't like this :(
As we spoke a few weeks ago, the non-driver model users of sysfs are ok.
Yes, it's not trivial to use sysfs in this manner, and it should be made
easier, but we still need to keep our tree of objects.  Using a kobject
for sysfs access is a good thing as it provides a tiny grasp on keeping
the usage of sysfs under control.
So while I like the separation of sysfs and kobjects from an
architectural and conceptual level for testing and understanding, I do
not want to allow the use of sysfs without creating a backing kobject
like we do today.
I'm all for making the "raw" kobject access easier, cleaning up the
attribute "mess" that you need to go through.  The cleanups that Kay and
I have been doing in the kset and subsystem area are steps in that
direction and I have more I want to do there to help make it easier to
use and understand.
So, I'll try to pick and choose from this patchset what I feel is ok for
now.
Or does it depend on the second set of patches that are yet to be
applied due to disagreements about module lifetimes?
thanks,
