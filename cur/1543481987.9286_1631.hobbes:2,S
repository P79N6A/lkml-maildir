Subject: small glitch in "make config" with 2.2.0-final

If during "make config" I reply "yes" to all of the MD options,
but then during a second "make config" run reply "no" to the umbrella
option "Multiple devices driver support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD)",
I still get a prompt for "Boot support (linear, striped) (CONFIG_MD_BOOT)".
