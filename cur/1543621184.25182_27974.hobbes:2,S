You're right. I looked at the generated assembly, and the volatile cast
makes no difference.

Although you're right that a volatile pointer is the proper way to do
it, it turns out that a volatile declaration isn't necessary at all. The
cmpxchg() function is a memory barrier that forces the count to be
refetched the next time through the loop.

I'm not much of an assembly programmer, so implementing it this way
never crossed my mind. It looks much more efficient than the code
generated from the C version. A drawback is that it is not as easy to
port to other architectures, particularly those that already have a
cmpxchg() function.
It's up to you whether you prefer C or assembly. Let me know, and I'll
test that version and regenerate the patch.
