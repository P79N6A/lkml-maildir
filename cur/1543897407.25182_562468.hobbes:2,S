    The "env" solution is a bit of a problem, too. Not always "env" is
installed in /usr/bin, but in /bin, so it is available even if /usr is
not still mounted. But /bin/sh is pretty standard (as it should be
/bin/bash, anyway), and it's only two chars shorter than the correct
"/bin/bash". No idea why it is not fixed.
