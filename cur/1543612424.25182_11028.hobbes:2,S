Thus my wish for 2.5.x.  It seems that the problem I am having maybe in the ide driver itself.  I searched the web on this a lot before I sent this to the list, and found a post from Alan Cox saying that this was a low priority.

Damn.  Lost interrupt is outside my code.  This lives in the ide driver 
proper and is probably relative toi the via82cxxx specific controller 
code that is deep voodoo from Andre.  I guess Andre/Jens have not found 
all the *funnies* in the buggy chipset.

Yes, but at the FS level, not in clever driver level stuff.
