Is it really intended to merge drivers without _any_ kind of review?
This driver even lacks a basic "please fix the > 250 checkpatch errors" [1]
and similar low hanging fruits that could easily be spotted and then 
fixed by the submitter within a short amount of time.
I see the point that it might make sense to not prevent the merging of 
drivers infinitely when they have some hard-to-fix issues, but was this 
really meant as an excuse for maintainers to no longer any review of 
what they merge at all?

There might be worse code being submitted, but when looking at what gets 
merged into Linus' tree this driver beats all other drivers I remember 
in both number of stylistic problems and bugs. [2]

[1] not to mention the > 2000 checkpatch warnings
[2] as already said, that's not meant against the driver submitter
    I'm complaining about the complete lack of review that would have 
    brought this driver into shape
