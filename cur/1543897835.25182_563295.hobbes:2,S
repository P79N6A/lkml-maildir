Correcting the correction (sorry, it was late) -- "hw:N" is card N, "hw:N,M" 
is PCM interface M of card N and "hw:N,M,K" is (hardware mixed) subdevice K 
on PCM interface M of card N. Normal cards have only one PCM interface 
meaning that M is 0 in the above.
That is, I meant that "hw:N,0,0", "hw:N,0,1" and so on are the hardware 
mixed devices.
