Although sarcasm aside, a couple of ideas that have been bantered around 
on this list (and a few of my own ideas):
	- /proc interface alternative to modutils/module-init-tools.
		That is, to have a directory of virtual nodes in /proc
		to provide the functionality of insmod, rmmod, lsmod &
		modprobe would be great -- especially from the viewpoint
		of recue disk images, etc.
	- Software RAID 0+1 perhaps?
		A lot of hardware RAID cards support it, why not the
		kernel?  By RAID 0+1 I mean mirror-RAIDing two (or more) 		stripe-RAID 
arrays.  (Or can this be done already?)
	- Transparent Software-RAID for IDE RAID cards...
		This could be done by using the Software RAID
		functionality of the kernel, but making the RAID
		interface transparent, so you only see a /dev/md?
		device, rather than multiple /dev/?da* entries.
	- Support for the Casio DV-01 USB digital notetaker.
Just some thoughts...
And I spose, a few people have mentioned this already, what is planned 
for Linux 3.0?
