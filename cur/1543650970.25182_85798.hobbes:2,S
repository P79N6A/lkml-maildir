The scenario is: we're doing load testing of http products,
and for various reasons, we want line-rate traffic with
the smallest possible message size.  i.e. we want the
maximum number of HTTP requests/responses per second.
Hence the 1 byte payloads.   A single system call on the
slowish embedded processor I'm using has a suprisingly large
impact on the number of http gets per second I can do.
A 1% increase in speed is worth it for me!
So please do try to reduce the number of syscalls needed
to handle very short TCP sessions, if possible.
