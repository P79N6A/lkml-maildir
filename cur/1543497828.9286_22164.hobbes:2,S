Hello,
I just bought a brand new PIII, and I don't know by what way I can
use the new function of it, I know there are kernels patch, but
regarding the posts in linux-kernel, I was not able to find it...
And maybe there are special compilers for it?
Thanks for any info!
Please, don't cc to me: I am on the list...
