I have zero experience in the hardware side of things, so I'll not try
and argue the point with you (I'd lose horribly). I certainly hope you
are right though. I'd love a 3.5" server for $300. I'm imagining small
DNS servers, small mail servers, small log servers, etc.
I'm guessing what will really happen is that a drive manufacturer will
use a different embedded OS and Linux will quickly be ported to it.

Ugh, more graphical than I needed to hear, but you're right.
