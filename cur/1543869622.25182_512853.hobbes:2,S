Results nevertheless are the same.
Each syscall takes some time first (noticebly more than subsequent
calls), and that was a main problem for Bert.
Given the high load, recvfrom() can even take tens of microseconds
(although I can not provide a profile output yet, but I showed a data).
So, syscall overhead itself is very small no matter which type of the
CPU is used - athlon is about 300 nsec, via epia about 1.4 usec), 
but the whole function can take quite a lot of time.
