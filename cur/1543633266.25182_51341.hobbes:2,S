They surely look useful. Catching errors this way is better than having
to experience every one on a production system before they are found.
There are some false positives, but compared to the actual number of
bugs found, that is not a problem.

This one isn't a bug. The pointer to allocated memory is stored in two
variables. Only one of them is verified against NULL, that is enough.
