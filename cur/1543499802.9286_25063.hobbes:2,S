No, the dcache would actually have the thing explicitly as two separate
entries: the directory entry would be one entry, and the "default" thing
would just be the entry that gets looked up.

Think of it as a extension of "follow_link": directories on this kind of
filesystem would have special follow-link semantics. So you'd have a
directory like this
	dir/
		default
		other
		more_other
		ABBA_rulez_disco
		...
and then "dir" would just have a follow-link function that looks something
like this:
	if (flags & LOOKUP_CONTINUE)
		return dir;
	dput(dir);
	return default;
See? _Internally_ it would be a true tree, and it's only the act of name
lookup that has this magic follow-link behaviour. 
(This, btw, is yet another reason why I have never accepted patches that
think that "readlink" and "follow_link" are somehow related. I have
never thought that they have any real relationship apart from a "UNIX
semantics" kind of relationship).
