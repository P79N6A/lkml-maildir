Hi!
I would like to ask how can I start writing accelerated driver on linux. 
Right now I
am realy confused, because there is no real documentation about it (or I 
can't find one).
We get the documentation which is describing hardware (sort of?!) from 
manufactorer,
and that's it.
Target platform for this driver is linux 2.6 runing Qtopia application - 
without X server.
This message could be a bit confusing, but that is how I feel at the moment.
I am not planing to implement whole 3D accelerating (for now), but only 
implement 2D blit and
multisampling.
Cheers,
Rok Markovic
