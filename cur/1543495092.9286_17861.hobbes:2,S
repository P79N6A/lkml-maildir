How about the 3rd way: a cluster of systems, each having local access
to their own disks. You are limited only by the speed of the network
to the systems, and how fast each can talk to its local disk. This is
how Legion does it, and some other parallel filesystems built on top
of things like NFS (although CIFS would be better).
I assure you that my cluster with gigabit networking and 64 fast/wide
SCSI busses is quite fast at doing parallel I/O. And if you have all
the data mirrored to a different node, you can do rolling upgrades.
This has slid off topic. But there's more than one way to skin a cat.
