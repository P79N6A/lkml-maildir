The last kernel that works for me (i686) is 2.3.20. And that one is a
suspect in illegal eating of filesystems... duplicate blocks with what
looks like deleted files.
2.3.22 and 23pre1 just call modprobe close to a thousand times (PID is 1060
or so when the next process starts, I see something like 12 to 20 "VM:
killing process modprobe"), even with init=/bin/bash, and a simple
ps(1) crashes it with a BUG() at the beginning of schedule()
