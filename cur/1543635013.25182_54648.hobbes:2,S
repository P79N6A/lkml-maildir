This is true for 4k blocksize.

Since kernel is yet to support block devices bigger than 2Tb, this is not an
issue yet.
Also Hans have not found a sponsor to fund this stuff which is also a problem.
Besides stuff you've just pointed out, there are also 32bit limit on
blocknumbers present in reiserfs v3 (which gives us 16Tb or something like that
limit for 4k blocksize)
