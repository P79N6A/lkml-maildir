module unload, where module count is decremented by timer; timer must
be finished.  Also: `if (!del_timer(timer)) sync_timers();' ==
del_timer_sync() for self-destructing timers.

From kernel/softirq.c:
/* BHs are serialized by spinlock global_bh_lock.
   It is still possible to make synchronize_bh() as
   spin_unlock_wait(&global_bh_lock). This operation is not used
   by kernel now, so that this lock is not made private only
   due to wait_on_irq().
   It can be removed only after auditing all the BHs.
 */
Sure, this is overkill for merely syncing timers, but it puts the API
in place for 2.5.
