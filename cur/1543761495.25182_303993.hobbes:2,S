Ewww!
How about sticking with obvious readable code rather than trying to save
a couple of conditional branches.  If it is an obvious good
optimization, let the compiler do it.  of course if you ever needed to
pass different parameters to f1 and/or f2 it would have to be rewritten
back to the original again.
