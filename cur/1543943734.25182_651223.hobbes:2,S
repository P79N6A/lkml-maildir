It takes someone telling the program to do it. The act of instructing the 
program is the actual "criminal" act. This is a 'Straw Man'. Next ?

Yes, of course, and I'll never argue otherwise. However, what I was saying is 
that it is the claim of the FSF that, in no uncertain terms, a C program that 
uses the standard C library interface and is linked to glibc instead of, say, 
the old Borland libc, is automatically GPL because it's been linked to GPL 
code.
And in the case of the "Bison Exception", lets think of it this way... A 
company writes a configuration file parser and is selling the software to 
other companies for use on their Solaris and SysV machines. The board decides 
to sell the software for linux and the employee in charge of the linux build 
uses the standard GNU tools for the entire process, including Bison. Even 
without the exception it wouldn't make the program a derivative of Bison or 
even come close to  putting the code under the GPL.

Straw man. Again.
But... You'd have fallen afoul of the "intent". Action follows intent, and so 
does the law. (At least in the US)

And I've actually read almost all the court cases that have a bearing on this. 
(I don't step into a discussion unprepared)
If the process of linking could create a derivative work, the *EVERY* program 
that runs on *ANY* OS would be a derivative of that OS, because the program 
is linked to the OS at run-time.
