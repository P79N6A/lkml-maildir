so here's an UP suspend+resume trace i did:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/latency-tracing-patches/misc/trace-suspend-long.txt.bz2
tons of detail - which might be interesting to other folks as well. Fact 
is, our suspend-to-RAM+resume cycle is very, very slow, even on fast 
hardware - and this trace shows all the reasons why.
This was a fully cached system - i.e. i've done a suspend+resume before 
to warm up the caches. (not that suspend+resume does much IO normally.)
The trace shows that a suspend+resume cycle is 7.95 seconds long 
(without counting the time the box spent suspended) - ouch! This was a 
T60 with Core2Duo 1.83GHz.
For example here is where freezing starts:
    bash-2397  0.... 31686us : remove_wait_queue (vt_waitactive)
    bash-2397  0.... 31688us : freeze_processes (enter_state)
    bash-2397  0.... 31689us : printk (freeze_processes)
here is where the ACPI code triggers the suspend:
    bash-2397  0D... 1904138us : acpi_hw_low_level_write (acpi_hw_register_write)
but this is a whopping 1.9 seconds into the trace already!
first sign of life after i opened the laptop lid again:
    bash-2397  0D... 1904138us : __restore_processor_state (restore_processor_state)
    bash-2397  0D... 1904138us : enable_sep_cpu (__restore_processor_state)
(in the trace there's no delay visible - the period of time spent 
suspended is not visible to the tracer.)
One good way to start looking at such traces is to filter out 
rescheduling events alone:
  grep ': schedule <'  trace-suspend-long.txt
that gives a rough outline of what's going on:
   <idle>-0     0D... 1776566us : schedule <bash-2397> (0 20)
     bash-2397  0D... 1786748us : schedule <<idle>-0> (20 0)
 scsi_eh_-419   0D... 1786814us : schedule <bash-2397> (0 -5)
     bash-2397  0D... 1786960us : schedule <scsi_eh_-419> (-5 0)
 scsi_eh_-421   0D... 1787020us : schedule <bash-2397> (0 -5)
     bash-2397  0D... 1787125us : schedule <scsi_eh_-421> (-5 0)
so you can zoom in on the real area of interest by searching for the 
timestamp.
Hope this helps,
