I've just looked how many messages I've got from this mailing list
In the last 4 months I've got over 12,000! messages. wow..
I feel sorry for the guys who read every single message every day.
But saying that I applaud all the knowledgeable people who put in
alot of work into the Kernel of the best operating system in the
known universe. (You know who you are). Without you all we would
all be Gates minions :-)
Thanks
