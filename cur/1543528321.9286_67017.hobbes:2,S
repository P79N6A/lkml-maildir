Thanks for digging that up.
I've sent mail to webmaster@gtk.org asking them to put up a page about gdoc.
btw, one of the doc generators you mentioned, doc++, has a new URL;
it's now at 
http://www.linuxsupportline.com/~doc
++/
and is actively maintained; they fixed a bug I reported in under a day.
It would be nice if the old page at imaginator.com became a
redirect to the new page.  (Right now the old one still claims to be the doc++
home page, which is misleading.)
