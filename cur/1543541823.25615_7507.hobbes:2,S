YES, an API. Call it magical if you want, but anything else is a
*HORRIBLE* kludge, and shouldn't be considered, let alone touched with a
bargepole.
It's VERY simple:
- stat() returns an extra flag if the object being queried has streams.
- stat() returns an extra flag if the object being queried has EAs.
- EAs are accessed using a specific API.
- Whether streams are access via a kludge to open() to modify the
namespace or an open_stream() call is not something I'm too bothered
about. If people can come up with a printable character that's not valid
anywhere else, then fair enough. '/' and ':' are already out of the
question for reasons previously discussed.
There is no sane way to handle every aspect of this without some sort of
API.
