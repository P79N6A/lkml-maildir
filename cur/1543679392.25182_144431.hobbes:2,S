Haven't had a chance to try this yet, so I don't have a feel for the
benefit (other than good karma). But having as an option is good,
depending on how out of date the lib has to be to have troubles should
determine default, this is not the stock kernel and can be defaulted to
enable new features IMHO.
The reason I haven't tried it is because I'm trying to find time to shake
out the 73-wli kernel, which will find a home on my slower boxen.
