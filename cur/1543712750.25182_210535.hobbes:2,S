I do think it's something to worry about, it does seem peculiar.
Dunno why, but I never received the first mail in this thread,
neither directly nor via the list, but have now got it from MARC.
I doubt this is the cause of the problem (would not, I think,
cause all of the associated symptoms you describe), but I think it
is a bug in your code which could cause the WARN_ON(!page->mapping):
Imagine if the filesystem (or driver) nopage gave you the empty zero
page for a private writable mapping (it better not give it you for a
shared writable mapping!), perhaps to represent a hole in the file.
I think it will pass the various tests in your do_no_page, and if
it's a write_access, that will correctly copy the page and set_pte
for this private copy: but it doesn't update pageable (from 0 to 1)
for it, so skips the page_add_rmap; and eventually page_remove_rmap
will be passed this page with neither PageAnon nor page->mapping.
As I say, I doubt it's your case, but worth fixing:
force pageable on where you set anon in do_no_page.
