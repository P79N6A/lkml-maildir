I think I found the bug:
Someone (Jeff?) removed the line
	tp->advertising[phy_idx++] = reg4;
from tulip/tulip_core.c
pnic_check_duplex uses that variable :-(
There are 2 workarounds:
* change pnic_check_duplex:
s/tp->advertising[0]/tp->mii_advertise/g
* remove the new mii_advertise variable and replace it with
'tp->advertising[i]'.
Jeff, is it really a good idea to have one global mii_advertise
variable? If someone builds a card with multiple transceivers, then
they'll probably support different medias.
