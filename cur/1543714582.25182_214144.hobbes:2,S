That would be way too subtle for a BIOS writer;-)

I agree.  And I think the existence of this /proc/interrupts
entry on an ACPI-enabled system should probably go away.

ACPI also doesn't support sharing more than 1 pin on an IRQ.
So if you see a construct like this below, it is also a bug:
IRQ to pin mappings:
IRQ23 -> 0:23-> 0:7
