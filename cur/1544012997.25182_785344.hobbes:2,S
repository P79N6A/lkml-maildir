OK. I'll try to improve it.

Well we should just ask the Xen people whether it will work or not. Why
wouldn't it? Xen has to be able to cope with kernel mappings coming and
going.

Just to have a straightforward fix for stable kernels I guess.

Sure, but I have added a check for that so it will panic if
there is a problem. My patch hasn't made things in that department
more fragile, put it that way.

With highmem debugging, yes I think I saw a kmap bug come from CPU7.

Because it's in the pkmap area?

Hmm... x86 CPUs can cache higher level page table translations in
non-cache-coherent buffers, so they could continue to look at the
old page table page after we insert new mappings int othe new one,
thus missing them and faulting. I don't know whether that fault is
going to be guaranteed to flush those higher level translations,
but I don't want to risk it. It's not performance critical.

Which? (ah, I see below)

What do you mean? Contiguity of pte pages is guaranteed after my patch.
If there is anything else it is supposed to do but doesn't, then that's
for another patch?
