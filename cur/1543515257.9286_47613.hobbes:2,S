I am getting a dual Celeron Abit motherboard.
I understand by reading the FAQ and the vendor who is selling me
the ABIT that this board will run REDHAT 6.0.
I just want to know if the Dual Celeron will be recognized by the
Redhat 6.0 E-COmmerce kernel or do I need to do any extra
software configiration ?
Thanks,
