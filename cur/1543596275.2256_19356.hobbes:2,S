Well, when I look at other Linux code, I assume that if it does something
weird, it does it for a reason.
That is the case here. The Global Lock is for synchronizing accesses between
the OS (that's us) and the firmware (SMI). Normal spinlocks are for intra-OS
locking. Here, we're synchronizing access with the BIOS. It's different.
All this code has been working for as long as I can remember.
You mention twice that it is "expensive". Keeping in mind the 80-20 rule, in
what way do you find this code costly?

By design, it works. We get to slipstream Windows a little here in that
vendors need to have a working Global Lock interface to pass WHQL.

We're depending on vendors (aka the BIOS) for all the ACPI tables, as well
as every other piece of a priori data we need to boot the OS.
Could I please ask that you at least show me a system where this is a
problem before throwing out all the work we've done on ACPI because of this
technical nit?
