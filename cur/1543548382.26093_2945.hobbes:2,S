Using net-tools 1.57 (which I think is the latest) and kernel
2.4.0-test7/8 (I think it was OK with -test6) 'netstat -s' displays
the message "error parsing /proc/net/snmp: Success" rather than
displaying the counters.
I notice that kernel/Documentation/Changes no longer lists the version
of net-tools to be used.
