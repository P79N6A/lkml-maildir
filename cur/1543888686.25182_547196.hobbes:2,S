Right, I'm just saying there's much more to it than just having the 
hardware locks (which of course we already have).

Maybe you should take a look at the patches. :)  The code I posted actually 
creates an fb device as a slave of the DRM device, and uses that for the 
boot console.  Once you've booted, you can use the new interfaces to do 
whatever you want with the graphics device... though it doesn't 
create /dev/fb* devices per-CRTC like you seem to want, it's really easy 
to do the equivalent with a small userspace program (though I haven't 
actually tested sharing of buffer objects, it should work).

Sure, I have no problem with that, but there are usually lots of ways to 
solve a given problem.
