Thousands "static int flag" variables taking 4 bytes where 1 byte
(actually 1 bit) would suffice. And when you do "flag = 1" -
store insns for bytes are also shorter by 3 bytes, _each_.
Unused code/data linked in
(-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -Wl,--gc-sections may help)
int global_n; char global_c; int global_m;
and you lose 3 bytes to alignment.
(How to instruct linker to sort sections by alignment or at least for size?
Tried -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -Wl,--sort-section,alignment
but it seems to only (try to) sort .data, not .data.var_name sections)
Massive inlining. Example: more than 80k of bloat in aic7*xx driver
because of gigantic inlined I/O access functions.
Sadistic alignment by gcc for structs/strings >= 32 bytes.
(gcc 4.2.1 is better, just don't forget -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2)
