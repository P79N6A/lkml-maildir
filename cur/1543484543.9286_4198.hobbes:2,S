Subject: A but that allows you to build a Linux 2.2.1 kernel that will not boot.

I believe that this bug has existed for some time (say 2.0.36), and is
not new to 2.2.1

PROBLEM:
If one sets the "Solaris (x86) partition table support" option from the
partion sub-menue in xconfig (which sets the define
CONFIG_SOLARIS_X86_PARTITION) then one ends up with a kernel that will not
boot without significant fiddling.
---
For reference, here is how hda is partitioned
        hda1 Win98
        hda2 FreeBSD
        hda3 Solaris
        hda4 Extended
        hda5 (unused)
        hda6 Linux
        hda7 Linux swap
---
During a `normal' boot I see the messages
        ...
        Partition Check:
        hda: hda1 hda2! hda3 hda4 < hda5 hda6 hda7 > < hda8 hda9 hda10 hda11 >
        hdc: [PTBL] [778/255/63] hdc3
        VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
        ...
Right off I have two questions:
    (a) what does the `!' on hda2 imply?
    (b) where do the bogus partitions hda8 - 11 come from?
---
If I invoke the Solaris options above, then at the same point in the boot
I see
        ...
        Partition Check:
        hda: hda1 hda2! hda3 <Solaris: [s0] hda5 [s1] hda6 [s2] hda7 [s3] hda8
            [s4] hda9 [s6] hda10 [s7] hda10 >
            hda4 < hda12 hda13 hda14 > < hda15 hda16 hda17 hda18 >
        hdc: [PTBL] [778/255/63] hdc3
        Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:06
So now it is showing me my SOLARIS (sub)partitions.
So a question
    (c) Why does it show my SOLARIS partions and not my FreeBSD partitions?
        Yes I have BSD Disklabel support turned on.
    (d) note that there are now bogus partitions hda15-18.
---
So the problem above IS that the kernel gets built expecting to find the
root file system in 03:06 (see the above panic) viz /dev/hda6 but its in fact
in /dev/hda13 under the new numbering plan.
If I CHANGE /etc/lilo.conf to contain `root=/dev/hda13' to override the
incorrect info in the kernel, I get a few lines further in the boot.
If I then ALSO change /etc/fstab to point to /dev/hda13 (rather than
/dev/hda6) and /dev/hda14 (rather than /hda7) for swap, then I can in fact
boot the kernel.
At that point I CAN mount /dev/hda5 and get to my SOLARIS root file system.
---
I dont think that I should have to build 10-20 kernels playing havsies to
find the offending option, and I surly shouldnt have to play with the
`root=/dev/hda13' stuff to make up for the kernel being built pointing
to the wrong place.
Ditto the changes to /etc/fstab.
---
Im not sure WHAT the boot is running to give the above listing of partitions,
but running /sbin/fdisk from Linux with the above root/fstab changes still
shows the old partition numbering scheme...
---
So Im not sure WHAT the fix should be here, but it should be made more
consistant, one cant just point the kernel at the right place (03:13)
since the /etc/fstab also needs to be modified.  One (minimally) needs
to LABEL the additional partitions differently so that they will have
a consistant name whether the subpartitions are expanded or not.
This latter solution would seemto be fairly simple.

[ I can supply other informtion, including the .config file in use, but
  I dont think its relevant ]
