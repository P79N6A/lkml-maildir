Heh, I thought of exactly that case when I rolled out of bed this
morning.  Funny how that happens sometimes, you can be sitting in front
of the code and make what you think is a perfectly valid analysis and
then wake up the next morning with no context at all and realize you
were wrong.  That happens to me anyway :-), I can't be the only one...
Nevertheless, that is a pretty unlikely corner case.  They double up
only when last_balance+interval is the same and one of the CPUs involved
is CPU 0.
