I have not investigated. But at least the way to transmit the passphrase
is very different. These out-of-kernel patch sets also come with
patches for util-linux. Usually the resulting patched losetup uses
some cryptographically strong digest algorithm to transform the
passphrase into the byte array sent to the kernel.
But I left all crypto out of mount and losetup in util-linux 2.12.
On the one hand we already have crypto in the kernel - no need to
duplicate that. But on the other hand, the preparation of the passphrase
has also been left out. The only handle put into mount/losetup is the
ability to read from a specified file descriptor.
So, today, you would need something like
% get_passphrase | mount -o loop,encryption=aes -p0 dev dir
where get_passphrase is a separate, to be written, utility that reads
the passphrase and digestifies.
Maybe I'll make things a bit friendlier in 2.12a, for example with
% mount -o loop,encryption=aes,getpw=/usr/local/bin/get_passwd dev dir
where mount itself forks off a process that produces the password.
Comments (and code) are welcome.

Wait! /dev/loop5 is your block device, and /dev/hda4 is the file it is setup on.
Now behind the back of loop you fiddle with /dev/hda4. No surprise that fails.
