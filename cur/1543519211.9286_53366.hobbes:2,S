There is no such thing as 256 ASCII codes.  The ASCII codes go
from 0 to 127.  Grab any computer programming book off your shelf
and you can easily find this out yourself.  The upper 128 codes
are not part of ASCII, and are no where near standard at all
period.  *IF* they work at all you are indeed lucky.  The IBM PC
style computers for the most part have a common "IBMPC extended
character set" but it does vary from here to there as I
understand it.

Look at the source for a program that does what you are wanting
to do.  Midnight Commander for example.
