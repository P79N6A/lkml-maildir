Sync up a reservation fix from ext2 in ext3
------------------------------------------------------
Subject: ext2 balloc: fix _with_rsv freeze
From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
After several days of testing ext2 with reservations, it got caught inside
ext2_try_to_allocate_with_rsv: alloc_new_reservation repeatedly succeeding on
the window [12cff,12d0e], ext2_try_to_allocate repeatedly failing to find the
free block guaranteed to be included (unless there's contention).
Fix the range to find_next_usable_block's memscan: the scan from "here"
(0xcfe) up to (but excluding) "maxblocks" (0xd0e) needs to scan 3 bytes not 2
(the relevant bytes of bitmap in this case being f7 df ff - none 00, but the
premature cutoff implying that the last was found 00).
Is this a problem for mainline ext2?  No, because the "size" in its memscan is
always EXT2_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb), which mkfs.ext2 requires to be a multiple of
8.  Is this a problem for ext3 or ext4?  No, because they have an additional
extN_test_allocatable test which rescues them from the error.
