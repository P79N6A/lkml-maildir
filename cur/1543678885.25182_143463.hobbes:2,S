Hm, I guess you mean kernel version? I am experiencing this problem since about
21-rcX versions, currently running 22-pre1.
The 3ware setup is pretty straight forward a RAID5 with 3 160 GB disks and no
spare.
I would not deny nfs to interact with this problem. Can you try to move your
backup'ed data from somewhere via nfs to your tar'ing box?
