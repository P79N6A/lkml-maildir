If you want to do that you need to move binoffset to scripts/kconfig/
All *config target are handled by the Makefile there.
And if you want to compile a hostprogram only on demand it needs to
be in the same dir as the Makefile.  It can be worked around, but
moving the file is the better solution.
One other way would be to build binoffset when CONFIG_IKCONFIG is set.
