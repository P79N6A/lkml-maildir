well, in fact it's 1193181.666... (14318180/12).

you meant 1000, I suppose ?

those interested can try 511 Hz (/2334.994) or 1900 Hz (/627.990) which
has the double advantage of being multiple of 100 Hz and have a little
drift due to frac part (/628 gives 1899.97 Hz, and /627 gives 1903.001 Hz).
If you don't need a multiple of 100 Hz, I noticed that dividing by 5709
gives 209.0001 Hz.
I'm also wondering why we never use the RTC as an interrupt source. Are
there any incompatible PCs ?
Cheers,
Willy
