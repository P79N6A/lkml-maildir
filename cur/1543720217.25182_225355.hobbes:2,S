The original version in the 2.4 kernel has a dramatic problem
leading to FS corruption, at least when used with blkmtd on CF.
That's why I'm using 2.4 and a CVS snapshot, not only because
it is much faster.

Believe it or not but JFFS2 is the only filesystem that works
reasonably on CF, especially when the system is used mostly read
only and the device is cut off from power every now and then. ;)
I tried different FS which we used read-only (and remounted it
r/w in case we needed it) in the last tries but we still were
able to kill a card without a problem and had FS corruption which
needed a console to fix.
Servus,
