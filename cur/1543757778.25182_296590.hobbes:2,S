You _could_ fix that by getting the pagetable spinlock, I guess. Which
check_user_page_readable() assumes you'd be holding anyway (not holding it
would appear to be a bug).
At which point you might as well just walk the tables by hand and just do 
the read that way. Of course, then you have virtual aliasing issues etc.
Insane, but possible.
