This code is very long out of sync with the existing upstream zlib in
terms of coding style and content, so I doubt my changes will make
much difference from that perspective.
As one of my eventual goals is to get us down to exactly one copy of
this in the kernel, I think it's a step forward. This set of patches
goes a long way towards that goal by making inflate support just a
couple lines for most of the kernel uses.

I will fix any security-relevant bugs, provided other folks don't beat
me to them.
