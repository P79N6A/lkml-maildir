The bus (PCI, AGP, whatever) is a much more severe bottleneck than even 
the CPU.
If it takes two-dozen parameters to specify a triangle that ends up 
plotting only a single pixel on the screen, it's just not worth doing. 
But that is something that happens a lot onboard 3D chips.  That's why 
triangle rate is as important a factor as pixel rate.
