The riser card must not be very active as the device(s) are sitting
on bus #0, that means no PCI-PCI bridge.
BTW: REQ/GraNT lines are not a problem and probably that's what the
manufacturer considers "active". IDSEL lines may be a problem (they
define device#, must not clash with other devices, and it would be
nice if the BIOS recognized them). IRQ lines are usually the main
problem.
OTOH I wonder if we should make it possible to force IRQs on
per-device basis? Or is it already possible?
