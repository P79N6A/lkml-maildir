Yes - that's what I was trying to imply above.

Don't know. Either it's still running (for much longer that 2 seconds),
linux is causing it run _again_, or linux is has terribly confused the
device somehow. More on this in an email I'm still working on...will
send that out in a bit.

64-bit BAR is seperate from 64-bit Device (data path).
PCI has three different 32 vs 64-bit areas:
o BARs
o DMA 
o HW/data path width.
"32-bit device" generally only refers to the latter.
The three attributes are generally all "32-bit" for "32-bit device".
That's less likely to be true for "64-bit devices". Several "64-bit
devices" can only DMA to 32-bit host memory and at least a few only
support 32-bit BARs (even if the device claims it has a 64-bit BAR).
