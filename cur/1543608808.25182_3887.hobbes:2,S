The number of hardware ettings is just too many,and so I  fear
I may go somewhere  wrong. so I want it the automatic way only.
1. Is this approach been discussed earlier too ? How easy/tough is it 
  to do it ? how good/bad is it ?
2. How is hardware detected ? Which part of the kernel source should
I look at ?
Again, please cc me the responses.
