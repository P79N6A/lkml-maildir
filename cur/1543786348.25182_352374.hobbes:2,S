One issue is that I actually worry that Andrew will at some point be where 
I was a couple of years ago - overworked and stressed out by just tons and 
tons of patches. 
Yes, he's written/modified tons of patch-tracking tools, and the git 
merging hopefully avoids some of the pressures, but it still worries me. 
If Andrew burns out, we'll all suffer hugely.
I'm wondering what we can do to offset those kinds of issues. I _do_ like 
having -mm as a staging area and catching some problems there, so going 
through andrew is wonderful in that sense, but it has downsides.
Andrew?
