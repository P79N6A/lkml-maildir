Still the same issue here : On a quad port card, if only 1 port is up,
all is fine. This can be eth0, eth1, eth2 or eth3, it doesn't matter.
As soon as more than 1 port is up, the machine freeze. no oops, 
not event CTRL-Scrollback, nothing.
As the use I made of the 4 port eth is bridging, you can imagine
the freeze appears very shortly after boot ;-) 
Anyway. using the de4x5 driver for now.
Yann.
