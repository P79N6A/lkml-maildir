I use the ipw2100.sf.net drivers, and I've gotten the freeze without
even having those modules loaded, so I doubt that's it.
I'm currently testing booting with acpi=off.  While, I've not had a
freeze yet (nearly 2 days), I may take your advice and test with
laptop-mode disabled as well, since I could definitely tolerate the loss
of laptop-mode better than the loss of my ACPI events and info.
