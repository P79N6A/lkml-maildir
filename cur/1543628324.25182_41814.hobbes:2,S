I have this motherboard too and have a similiar problem,
but it is usually not with reboots but with crashes.  I use
the nVidia graphics module which crashes time to time
and locks X, so I just hit the reset switch(Thank you
journalling fs).  But lots of times after I reboot it will
go through the initial POST, then go through the SCSI
detection, and 3ware detection, then when it should goto
the GRUB screen it will just display the POST screen
and hang, no beeps no nothing.  I usually have to power it
completely down for about a minute for it to come back
up right.  I have chalked this up to a BIOS problem though
and not a Linux one cause the BIOS should be smart enough
to pull it's head out of it's ass and reset any bad states that
may have been left behind. I would bitch to Tyan if I were you,
I have thought about it but never got up the energy.
