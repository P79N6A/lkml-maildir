Under all previous kernels, sendmail has appeared in its /proc/nnn/cmdline
entry (and, thus, in a `ps' listing) as `sendmail: accepting connections on
port 25'. Under 2.3.27pre6, it is `sendmail: accepting connection', just the
first 30 characters. This is sendmail 8.9.3, compiled under 2.2.13-pre
something.
Apart from that, it seems to continue working perfectly, and this problem
causes me no inconvenience at all.
