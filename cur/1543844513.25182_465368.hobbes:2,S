Good point, I will change it to :
#define MARK_SYM(name) \
        do { \
                __label__ here; \
                volatile static void *__mark_kprobe_##name \
                        asm (MARK_CALL_PREFIX#name) \
                        __attribute__((unused)) = &&here; \
here: \
                do { } while(0); \
        } while(0)
Which fixes the problem. Some tests showed me that the compiler does not unroll
an otherwise unrolled loop when this specific macro is called. (test done with
-funroll-all-loops).

Mathieu
