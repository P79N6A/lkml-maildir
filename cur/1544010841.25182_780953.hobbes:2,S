Well, if git commit could add that template in addition to the
Signed-off-by line, that could be a start, perhaps as a new option and
then it would get it from .git/changelog-template, that would be
provided by each project.
/me scratches head...
    -t, --template <FILE>
                              use specified template file
Its there already, but then perhaps what is needed is a _default_
template.
