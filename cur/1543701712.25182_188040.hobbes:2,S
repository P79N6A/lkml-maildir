Hmm, the exact same thing as below seems to be going on in
fs/adfs/inode.c		- line 30
fs/befs/linuxvfs.c	- line 135
fs/bfs/file.c		- line 67 (this one's a little different, but the sector_t < 0 check is involved
fs/reiserfs/inode.c	- line 577
should I be worried?  Is this worth digging into any further?
I don't mind doing some intensive fs code studying, but before I commit a
lot of time to this it would be nice with a confirmation from someone who
already knows this stuff that it's worth spending time on... I don't yet
know enough to judge that..
