I happened to notice that my ksoftirqd_CPU0 process started spinning
at 99% CPU when I plugged in the ports to a tulip NIC.  I didn't see
any significant amount of interrupts when I looked at /proc/interrupts,
and there was no traffic running.
However, this is also running a hacked up tulip-napi driver, so it
could very well be my problem.  I have not seen this on any other kernel
in several months though...
Anyway, if anyone has seen this, I'd like to know.  Otherwise, I'll blame
my code and start poking at things...
Thanks,
Ben
