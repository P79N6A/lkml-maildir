Your way out in the weeds.  What started this thread was a customer who
ended up loading the wrong arch on a system and hanging.  I have to
post a kernel RPM for our release, and it's onerous to make customers
recompile kernels all the time and be guinea pigs for arch ports.  
They just want it to boot, and run with the same level of ease of use
and stability they get with NT and NetWare and other stuff they are used
to.   This is an easy choice from where I'm sitting.
