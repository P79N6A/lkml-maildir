In the 23-mm1 there is no such debug info. When the number of mem
resource (for one Pnp device) defined by BIOS exceeds the predefined
constant, the mem resource can't be added. But it won't report this
case. 
In the 24-mm2 the PnP constant is raised and the debug info is added.
When the number exceeds the predifined constant, it will give the debug
info. 
Thanks.
