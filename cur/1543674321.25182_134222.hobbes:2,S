It's a judgement call: how simple it is to change vs. the amount of
damage done by not changing it.
I don't think it's worth changing, but I don't think we're going to
convince each other.

Good point.  I'd prefer to fix the comment though, since it's not
true.  How about changing it to something like:
      	/* We can't handle futexes across multiple pages: best to reject
	   any crazy alignment to save the users from themselves. */

Sure.  My point was that this comment is actually from a v. early futex
version where the kernel actually did the atomic ops itself.
Hope that clarifies!
Rusty.
