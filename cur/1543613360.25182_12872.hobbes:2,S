I don't know much about sysctl specification, so could you show me
pointer to any document or something?
There is no /proc/sys/cpu directory on the latest kernel, and 
I guess someone is thinking the structure under the directory,
right?
I guess the operation would be
echo 1 > /proc/sys/cpu/hotplug/<cpu-id>/online
  or
echo 1 > /proc/sys/cpu/<cpu-id>/online
  or
echo <cpu-id> > /proc/sys/cpu/online
Which is the right way?
Regards,
Kimi
