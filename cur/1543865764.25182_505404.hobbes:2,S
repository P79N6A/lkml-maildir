Can you read? Can you UNDERSTAND?
This is exactly my point.
If it's not obviously a SCSI card, then it shouldn't be "depends on SCSI". 
It should be on its own and "select SCSI".
The whole AND ALMOST ONLY point of "depends on" is really to allow people 
to do a shorthand or know that "ok, he gave us some information that makes 
this choice pointless".
And yes, we've messed that up. But you're apparently arguing that the 
mess-up is something "good".
"select" is _good_. Because it's the thing that avoids us having to ask 
totally inane questions THAT DO NOT MAKE SENSE to a user.
It's totally idiotic that we should ask people for SCSI support. That's 
not a user question, unless we're talking "odd-ball obviously SCSI 
devices", and then the question actually makes sense as a way to allow 99% 
of all users to say "nope" and not have to see another million questions 
that aren't relevant to them.
