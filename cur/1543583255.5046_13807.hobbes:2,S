Hi
i'm running 2.2.19pre14+RAID+ide and get this message from kernel:
nfs_refresh_inode: inode number mismatch
expected (0x0ffffffff/0x0ffffffff), got (0x0002b0001/0x00005605)
                                                           ^^^^
marked numbers vary from message to message. i can triger this
by doing "make test;chmod 777 test" on some nfs mounted file sistem
some times repeated chmod generate more messages, sometimes are executed ok. 
i have feeling it happend more often when there is some cpu and net load.
linux nfs client is dual pentium II (266) on P2B-DS with 2
promise IDE cards, net card is smc (using realtek 8139 driver), ide and scsi 
disks are in RAID 5 setup.
nfs server is Apple Network server running AIX4.1.5
net conn is 100MB over Cisco switch
ah, there is one more thing. on boot when nfs get mounted i find in dmesg:
"nfs warning: mount version older than kernel"
WTF? :)
all this not happend on 2.2.17+RAID
any ideas patches, more info?
