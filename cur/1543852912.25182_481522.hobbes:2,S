Hello list,
I'm getting these errors trying to mount a burned DVD-R:
Nov  8 12:39:08 section_eight attempt to access beyond end of device
Nov  8 12:39:08 section_eight hdc: rw=0, want=68, limit=4
Nov  8 12:39:08 section_eight isofs_fill_super: bread failed, dev=hdc,
iso_blknum=16, block=1
The drive is a NEC ND-4550A ATAPI. I use idecd and kernel 2.6.18.2.
DVD+R discs mount just fine. There were no errors while burning the
DVD-R. I tried k3b(-0.12.17),
cdrecord(-2.01.01_alpha10/-2.01.01_alpha20) and growisofs-6.1/-7.0. The
drive is flashed with the latest firmware and the manufacturer claims my
16x DVD-R media is supported.
I can actually mount the burned DVD-R in my other DVD-ROM drive (it's a
read-only device, LITE-ON DVD SOHD-16P9SV).
I'm a bit lost because I can't figure out the proper place to report
this bug. I already posted to k3b-user but got no response. If you could
direct me to the proper person to talk to I'd be happy.

If some fields are empty or look unusual you may have an old version.
Compare to the current minimal requirements in Documentation/Changes.
