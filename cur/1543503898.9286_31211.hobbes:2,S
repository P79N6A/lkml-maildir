Subject: PATCH: ncr/sym drivers and bridges

I can propose a small preliminary patch that may be useful for ensuring
that the ncr/sym drivers will not lose completions with some not PCI
compliant bridges regarding flushing of posted write transactions.
For now, the changes consist in the following:
- Intel and IBM bridges are assumed fine.
- Alpha bridges (21172 and friends) is ok for the sym53c8xx driver by just 
  adding a dummy read in the interrupt handler. (The ncr53c8xx requires 
  a minor change in the SCRIPTS in order to be ok for the 21172 and I will
  provide such a change after my vacations).
- For other cases (ncr53c8xx under alpha included), the drivers may have
  to reap completions from its timer (ncr_timeout) handler.
  For the history, the original FreeBSD ncr.c still run such an handler
  and I donnot know of any other driver reaping interrupts this way.:)
By the way, I cannot beleive some other drivers I know a bit to be really
100% sure of not losing completions with some bridges I read about. 
The patch should apply to everything as ncr53c8xx-3.2* + sym53c8xx-1.3*
up to latest.
I am in vacation for the first half of August. Will refine the change 
as necessary after my vacation.
I cannot test the patch since I only have x86 boxes, assumed ok.
You may want to let me know asap if the patch makes problems.
