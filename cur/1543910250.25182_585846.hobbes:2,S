Yes. That will be the common case.

Not likely to degrade even under memory pressure ;)
The compress_ratio = (VSZ:RSS) * (RSS:page_ranges).
- On fresh startup and no memory pressure,
  - the VSZ:RSS ratio of ALL processes are 4516796KB:457048KB ~= 10:1.
  - the firefox case shows a (RSS:page_ranges) of 16k:2k ~= 8:1.
- On memory pressure,
  - as VSZ goes up, RSS will be bounded by physical memory.
    So VSZ:RSS ratio actually goes up with memory pressure.
  - page range is a good unit of locality. They are more likely to be
    reclaimed as a whole. So (RSS:page_ranges) wouldn't degrade as much.

True. I guess PFNs are meaningless to a normal user?

Not for now.
It would be trivial to support seek-by-address semantic: the seqfile
operations already iterate by addresses. Only that we cannot do it via
the regular read/pread/seek interfaces. They have different semantic
on fpos. However, tricks like ioctl(begin_addr, end_addr) can be
employed if necessary.

You are right :)

No way to avoid the seeks if PFNs are discontinuous. Too bad the
memory get fragmented with uptime, at least for the current kernel.
But sure, sequential reads are viable when doing whole system memory
analysis, or for memory hog processes.

Yes, and it's a nice graph :)
