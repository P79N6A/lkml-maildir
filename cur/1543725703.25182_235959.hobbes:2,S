Argh.  I had up to this point been passively following this thread because
a while ago, prior to dtrace and other such work I, Karim, and others
invested quite of bit of effort and time responding to this group pointing
out the benefits of performance monitoring via tracing and
IN FACT this was exactly one of the points I ardently made.  Having each
subsystem set up their own monitoring was not only counter productive in
terms of time and implementation effort, but prevented a unified view of
performance from being achieved.  Nevertheless, it appears that some
subsystem tracing has been incorporated, though tbh I have not followed as
closely recently.
LTT and relayfs offered the best performing, most comprehensive solution,
and was reasonably unintrusive.  The work was integrated with dprodes,
allowing dynamic insertion and the zero cost non-monitored overhead
proclaimed by dtrace.  As Karim has pointed out in previous posts, though
the technical concerns that were raised were addressed, it didn't seem to
help as other nits would crop up appearing to imply that something else was
happening.  If indeed the remaining issue is whether there is a benefit to
a performance monitoring infrastructure, then I wonder how you would
interpret reactions to dtrace.
