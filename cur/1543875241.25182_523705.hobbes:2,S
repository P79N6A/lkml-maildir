I'm not sure I understood this thread properly, but if I did understand
correctly then this bug affects IRQ balancing on any device with MSI-X
enabled.  In which case, there's plenty of publicly available hardware
with MSI-X support (including drivers in the mainline tree for a long
time).  A quick grep for pci_enable_msix finds plenty of drivers using
MSI-X now: cciss, ib_mthca, cxgb3, forcedeth, s2io, qla2xxx.
