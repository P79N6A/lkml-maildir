Extremely classic card. Would be fun to still have around if only for 
history's sake...

Also drives my PAS16s. Yes, it's very old -- non-pnp ISA and all that. 
Used to be a fairly popular card at the time though (since it sounds 
better than most other cards of the era) so there's still a couple of 
those around. I believe I have three lying around somewhere, one of them 
in fact still installed (in a machine that's currently not available 
though).
Sure, wouldn't be a tragedy to remove, but keeping it neither (writing 
an ALSA driver for the stupid thing has been on my personal TODO only 
slightly shorter then all the items preceding it).

The relation to PAS16 at least is that the PAS includes a (independent) 
SB8 compatible chip. The OSS driver supplies two sound devices. At the 
moment, I'm not recalling with certainty whether or not they were also 
hardware mixed, but I guess they were...
