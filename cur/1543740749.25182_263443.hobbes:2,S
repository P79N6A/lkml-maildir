Hi,
I'm trying to use my Airtel GPRS connection under Linux.
Status: pppd refuses connection due to improper remote IP address
(255.255.255.255)
(what puzzles me: Why on earth would someone use that as an IP address?)
What I did to get GPRS working:
1. Checked for the following details from Windows XP:
a. modem initialization strings
b. authentication type : pap
c. remote IP address: 255.255.255.255
d. gateway address: my own IP is made my gw (10.*.*.*)
e. name servers: automatically assigned numbers...
2. Rebooted into Linux
SuSE Linux 9.1 vanilla kernel (2.6.4-52-default)
3. Ran wvdialconf to see if phone is detected.
GPRS modem (LG G3100 model) was detected at ttyS0
4. Set up ppp options to allow 
defaultroute, 
noauth, 
ipcp-accept-local (and -remote)
Among others that are common.
5. Dialed (tried both direct pppd invocation and through wvdial)

The thing about "our own echo reply" is to do with GPRS modems - they
don't respond to "hey modem, are you still alive?" queries.

6. Tried a few things to "force" it to accept.
a. Edited pap&chap-secrets to "allow" 255.255.255.255
Result: no changes in response.
b. Edited pppd/ipcp.c to disable authentication
if (!auth_ip_addr(f->unit, ho->hisaddr)) {
        error("Peer is not authorized to use remote address %I", ho->hisaddr);
           ipcp_close(f->unit, "Unauthorized remote IP address");
           return;
        }
The above code snippet, which checks the authentication, was commented
out, so I can make the peer use the IP address without
"authentication".
(ps: This was necessary as adding an entry for the IP in pap-secrets
and chap-secrets had no effect on the error message.)
Result: fails when trying to set 255.255.255.255 as remote interface's
address (ioctl failure)
c. Edited pppd/sys-linux.c to set gateway ip=local ip
- SIN_ADDR(ifr.ifr_dstaddr) = his_adr;
+ SIN_ADDR(ifr.ifr_dstaddr) = our_adr;
Result: connection established. But, routing failed miserably. I was
not able to add a `route` so I could do virtually nothing with the
ppp0 link. Because nothing was reachable. (Obvious! But I gave it a
shot)
7. Called Airtel to know what protocol they were using so I can figure
out how to set it up.
Result: they didn't know what they were using on their side.
----------------------------------------------------
If anyone has further information which you think could be of some
help, kindly share. I'd appreciate it.
Thanks!
