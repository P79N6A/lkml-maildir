Are you even reading what they're saying? Having swap lets you move less 
frequently used data to disk in favour of having more frequently used data in 
RAM. 
Personally, I have more than enough RAM to run a fairly busy KDE2 desktop, 
and still have over 128megs in disk cache. And I still run with swap. The VM 
seems to find about 40megs of data I'm -simply not using-, and it now has the 
freedom to push that to swap so it can cache things that I -do use-. Although 
the more RAM you have, the less significant the results are, you'll find that 
in normal desktop/workstation/server use, the kernel will -always- find 
something to swap out to give itself more cache, and more cache is a very 
good thing. It's not fucking rocket science.
