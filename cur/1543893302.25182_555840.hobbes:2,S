It is _vastly_ different.

Yes, but this file, and the stable-api-nonsense.txt files are there to
help people understand both the kernel's philosophy, as well as
encourage them to help contribute.
That is totally different from internationalizing the internal kernel
messages (which, btw, some people are working on...)  That I would not
agree to as it's just too hard to keep up with and would be pointless in
a way.
So I really do want to see a translated copy of the HOWTO,
stable-api-nonsense.txt, and possibly a few other files in the main
kernel tree (SubmittingPatches, CodingStyle, and SubmittingDrivers might
all be good canidates for this.)  These files change relativly
infrequently (the HOWTO file has had only 7 changes in 1 and 1/2 years,
and they were very minor ones) and should be easy for the translators to
keep up with.
So, Tsugikazu, care to resend this file as a patch that I can apply to
the Documentation directory of the kernel tree?  I think it would be
good to have there.
thanks,
