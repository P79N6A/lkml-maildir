I think this may be because wine uses a client/server model.  There is
the wine client which runs the actual applications, but they seem to
share the core wineserver process which seems to be responsible for
actually mixing and generating the sound output.  Renicing the 'wine'
(frontend) process give the 'wineserver' (backend) process more CPU time
to actually get the sound out.
I don't know much about WINE, so all of that is only a guess as to how
it appears to be working to me.  I guess I should go read up on it.
Later,
Tom
