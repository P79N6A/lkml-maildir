As far as I know, on a queue overflow, SIGIO is raised and you can select() or
poll() on your fds. This of course is going to be exceptionally slow on a
large number of descriptors, but it shouldn't happen often.
I believe the aio_* functions in glibc do handle SIGIO by default as a backup
when the queue overflows.

You can use F_SETSIG w/ an RT signal & SIGIO directly instead of the aio_*
functions and you will be notified when data is ready to be read on the
socket.
This isn't as simple as using the aio_* functions, but it will allow you a
method to eliminate poll()'s and select()'s most of the time.
However, I'm trying to imagine a need for a read poll which couldn't be
substituted easily with an aio_read() call and an example isn't coming to
mind. 
I've checked a few OS's and they all say that a read w/ 0 byte specified will
return 0 immediately and have no other results which would be consistent with
the semantics of aio_read().
