[TCP]: Fix TCP header misalignment
[ Upstream commit: 21df56c6e2372e09c916111efb6c14c372a5ab2e ]
Indeed my previous change to alloc_pskb has made it possible
for the TCP header to be misaligned iff the MTU is not a multiple
of 4 (and less than a page).  So I suspect the optimised IPsec
MTU calculation is giving you just such an MTU :)
This patch fixes it by changing alloc_pskb to make sure that
the size is at least 32-bit aligned.  This does not cause the
problem fixed by the previous patch because max_header is always
32-bit aligned which means that in the SG/NOTSO case this will
be a no-op.
I thought about putting this in the callers but all the current
callers are from TCP.  If and when we get a non-TCP caller we
can always create a TCP wrapper for this function and move the
alignment over there.
