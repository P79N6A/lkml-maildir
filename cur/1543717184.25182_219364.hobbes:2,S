I have had 2 serious hard disk problems with the 4KSTACKS patch 
installed, once through ignorance and once when I plain forgot and had 
only checked that it wasn't on in my .config.
The first disk failed to boot up fully, it just hung somewhere in init, 
but I could get at the files, the second one was dead, I had to do a 
fresh format/install, reiserfsck /debugreiserfs could not repair either 
of them. It's a dangerous patch.
Regards
Sid.
