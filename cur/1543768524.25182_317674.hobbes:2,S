I have tested doing
	clone(CLONE_NEWNS);
	chdir(/some_jail_dir);
	pivot_root(., tmp)
	umount2(tmp, MNT_DETACH)
	chroot(.)
which appears to prevent escapes from chroot jails.  So unless my tests
were insufficient, we don't need additional kernel support.  We can just
use something like chroot_ns.c from www.sf.net/projects/linux-jail/.

and I'd say
e) Work towards the shared namespaces, which are really one of the
main reasons not to use namespaces right now.
I know this work is being done, so this isn't so much a request for the
shared namespaces, as just a reminder that this will be one of the major
pieces of functionality to consider along with the ones you listed.
