Over a period of time while the task is runnable.

It doesn't do much in other schemes, but when fairness is directly
measured by the dynamic priority, it is a priori more meaningful.
This is not to say the net effect of using it is so different.

There are two things, both of which are relatively subtle and
coincidentally happen to some extent. The first is the unpinned lag,
which behaves much differently from unpinned load weight even if it's
not so different in concept, but apparently achieves a similar result.
The second is the relativistic point of view, which happens somewhat by
coincidence anyway, but isn't formalized anywhere at all as a basis for
handling tasks pinned to cpus. The first difference is minor and the
second formalizing something that mostly or completely already happens.

It's sort of like performance. If the numbers are already good enough,
my algorithm on that front need not be bothered with either.
