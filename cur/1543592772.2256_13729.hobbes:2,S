Subject: 2.4.5 -ac series broken on Sparc64

i've successfully built the 2.4.5 vanilla kernel.
I went to check the -ac series, and each [1-4] breaks
in the same way on Sparc64 platform:
include/linux/irq.h:61: asm/hw_irq.h: No such file or directory
*** [sched.o] Error 1
a find . -name 'hw_irq.h' shows appropriate versions
in i386, ia64, mips, mips64, alpha, ppc, parisc, um, and sh
Is this is a ports-maintainer issue, or what?  Surely
breaking the sparc platform is not in the future plans...
Thanks.
