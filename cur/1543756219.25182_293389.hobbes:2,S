Not one I'd be familiar with, but that doesn't mean anything.
And I didn't see an "unusual_devs.h" entry for it, but it does
look to need the CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_HP8200e support, which I
see is labeled "experimental".  I don't know how solid the
support for that is.   But I see Greg's checked in a big patch
against the file with that driver, which should make the next
MM patchset against 2.6.11-rc3 ... mostly to support some
new hardware, but with that many changes I suspect there'll
be some bugfixes too.
This would be www.macpower.com.tw/produts/hdd2/daisycutter/dc_usb2
maybe?  The www.qbik.ch/usb/devices database has a report from one
user saying they had problems with a different MacPower adapter until
they fixed its jumpers.  Also worth a check.
