No.  The only ones I export are:
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(pv_time_ops);
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(pv_cpu_ops);
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(pv_mmu_ops);
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(pv_apic_ops);
EXPORT_SYMBOL    (pv_irq_ops);

Yeah, I was in two minds.  CR3, at least, should be grouped with the
other tlb operations, wherever they go.  And while they're privileged
CPU instructions (cpu_ops), they're more logically related to the rest
of the mmu state.  On the other hand, we could have an ops structure
specifically dedicated to pagetable manipulations, and put the cr3/tlb
ops elsewhere.

I think its used in some cpu state save/restore code, but its not
relevant to pv-ops.
