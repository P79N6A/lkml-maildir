I don't understand the need for this patch - the generic tagging is only
used if the SCSI LLD indicated it wanted it by issuing a
scsi_activate_tcq(). So blk_queue_start_tag() is only called if the LLD
already did a scsi_activate_tcq(), and blk_queue_end_tag() is only
called if the rq is block layer tagged. blk_queue_find_tag() is only
used with direct use of scsi_find_tag(), a function that should (and is)
only usable by users of the generic tagging already.
So please, a description of what problem you are trying to solve would
be appreciated :-)
