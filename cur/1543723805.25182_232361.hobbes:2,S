Subject: post 2.6.7 BK change breaks Java?

Hi,
I've pulled from the linux-2.6 BK tree some post-2.6.7 version, compiled
and installed it, and it breaks Java, standalone or plugged into
firefox, the symptom is that the application catches SIGKILL. This
didn't happen with stock 2.6.7 and doesn't happen with 2.6.6 either.
Is there any particular change I should try backing out?
TIA,
