I'm not sure whether what we plan to offer actually fits Space's definition
of spaces, but domains already exist and portals should be trivial to
implement over what we already have. For details on what plan to offer
in terms of spaces, take a look at the paper I wrote describing how
to implement Linux SMP clusters:
http://opersys.com/ftp/pub/Adeos/practical-smp-clusters.ps
Basically, Adeos would hand over RAM regions according to each OS
instance's requests. In such a case, each kernel would have its own
virtual memory and communication would be possible using "bridges",
shared physical RAM regions. Many OSes can coexist in the same virtual
address space, but the mechanisms for managing the virtual address
space are not up to Adeos.
