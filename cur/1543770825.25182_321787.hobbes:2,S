Applied with even no offsets to -rc5-mm1. Booted and working fine:
before
/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads:   2744 MB in  2.00 seconds = 1370.15 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  158 MB in  3.00 seconds =  52.64 MB/sec
after
/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads:   3000 MB in  2.00 seconds = 1498.73 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  160 MB in  3.03 seconds =  52.85 MB/sec
so no loose.
Thanks.
