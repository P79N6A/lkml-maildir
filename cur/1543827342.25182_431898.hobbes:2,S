But the hardware has changed. The kernel is missing a lot of the
support needed for multiple VGA cards in a single box so that option
isn't legal. So this needs to be done with non-VGA cards. Are there
non-VGA cards still in production where a user would want to put
multiple cards in their box? As far as I know they aren't any in the
x86 world, I don't know about other architectures.
All modern Hercules cards are VGA based, they use NVidia and ATI
chips. The reference was from 1998, they were referring to the ancient
Hercules cards that were non-VGA.
Back in the days of CGA, MDA, HGC, 8514, etc this situation was
common, but now everything is VGA.
