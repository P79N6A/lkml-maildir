Yeah right. And Earth turns into a tetrahedron at your command.
Dream on... but keep it for yourself.
And to shut this subthread for good, I searched the whole IEEE Std
1003.1, 2004 Edition - nothing states any stability for st_dev.
All you get with this standards are two uniqueness guarantees (i. e. no
duplicates at a certain point in time -- this does not imply any kind of
stability), namely:
1. st_dev changes across mounts (definitions) and
2. (st_dev,st_ino) tuples are unique (<sys/stat.h>)

Please don't respond. You're wasting time.
