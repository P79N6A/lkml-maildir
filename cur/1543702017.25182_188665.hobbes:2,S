I get the same thing using USB2 on a KT400/VT8235 mobo. I have a 20Gb
USB2 HDD (fat32), which produces this when accessed:
SCSI error : <1 0 0 0> return code = 0x8000000
Current sdb: sense key No Sense
end_request: I/O error, dev sdb, sector 19159735
Buffer I/O error on device sdb1, logical block 19159672
The drive works flawlessly with Windows and MacOS. A 128Mb USB key via
USB1.1 causes no problems. Not using udev, not using devfs. The USB2
drive works fine under 2.4.X as well.
