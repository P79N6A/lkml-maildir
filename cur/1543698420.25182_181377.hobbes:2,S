Standard thing when it can't talk to the sound card:
"Please check that:
  1. You have the correct output plugin selected
  2. No other programs is(sic) blocking the soundcard
  3. Your soundcard is configured properly
         [OK]"
FWIW, ALSA for the cs4281 chip on my home box works 100%, and xmms can talk
  to it without problem.  These are different distros (gentoo@home, debian@work)
  so it may also be a problem in Debian, but I don't think so.

Ja.  I'm gonna have to sort it out whenever I can get my homework done.
  Either this afternoon or tomorrow.  Just gotta copy some files over by
  floppy (e.g. route) and then tar them over from another machine.

Hmm.  I dunno.  The only odd thing atm is that the nvidia driver was loaded
  and had reported a couple of bugs.  When the machine's up next time,
  I'll try it sans nvidia and see what we get.  I don't suspect that's the
  problem, as everything but sound worked 100%, but we'll see.
Other than my diagnostic print statements or your pnp patch, everything
  at runtime was vanilla (except nvidia of course)

Microsoft's patents only defensive?
