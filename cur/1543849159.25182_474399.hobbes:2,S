What does it say in /proc/interrupts?
The x86_64 nmi watchdog handling looks rather complex.
<checks a couple of x86-64 machines>
The /proc/interrutps NMI count seems to be going up by about
one-per-minute.  How odd.   Maybe you just need to wait longer.
Or try booting with nmi_watchdog=2 (Documentation/x86_64/boot-options.txt).
There's an empty directory /sys/devices/system/lapic_nmi/lapic_nmi0/.  I
wonder what that does?
