APM isnt specified for SMP. What it does varies between the right thing
and crunching your computer. ACPI is specified for SMP and people are now
starting to use it.
Im not keen personally to support APM on SMP when it just "happens to work
for some people". Maybe some kind of BIOS revision check for known good
bioses woukd be appropriate ?
