Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

[updated] support for PCA9539 as a GPIO chip is separated into three patches:
0001 - gpiolib: basic support for 16-bit PCA9539 GPIO expander
0002 - gpiolib: add Generic IRQ support for 16-bit PCA9539 GPIO expander
0003 - gpiolib: obsolete drivers/i2c/chips/pca9539.c
The 2nd one uses workqueue for IRQ handling due to the interrupt mode
nature of the i2c-core, thus making it a separate patch.
