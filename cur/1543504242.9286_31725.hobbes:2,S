Ewww.. That basically *is* an mmap(), though, isn't it..

Well, it's been mentioned a number of times that one of the big goals for
2.3/2.4 is to improve SMP performance by finer locking granularity, so it
wouldn't surprise me if someone's thinking about this issue already. Maybe
sct has already done it :-)
