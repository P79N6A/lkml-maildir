An idea I've been toying with for a while now is completely abstracting
congestion control.  Then you could have congestion control loadable
modules, which would avoid this mess of experimental algorithms inside the
main-line kernel.  If done right, they might be able to work seamlessly
with SCTP, too.  The tricky part is making sure the interface is complete
enough.
