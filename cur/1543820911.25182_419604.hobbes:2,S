Indeed, I tried to be quite specific to targeted policy.  The point
is that having unconfined domains makes it very challenging to reason
about the security of the system.  So, while comprehensive strict policy
addresses that, it's also what nearly guarantees turning security off
for most normal general purpose machines ;-)
