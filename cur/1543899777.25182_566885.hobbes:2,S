OK but we're talking about SLOB. And the number that matters is the amount
of memory used, which is higher with SLUB than with SLOB in our tests.

Allocate n things and your memory waste is proportional to n (well that's
O(n) waste, so I guess by savings I mean that SLOB's memory saving compared
to SLUB are proportional to n).
