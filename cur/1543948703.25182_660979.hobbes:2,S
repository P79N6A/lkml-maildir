Ingo,
with the new ioremap() implementation I see a couple of (potential)
issues:
- When ioremap_page_range() fails, remove_vm_area() is used rather
  than vunmap() - I think this will cause a 'struct vm_struct' leak.
- While ioremap() continues to happily map RAM pages (with a bogus
  [see below] WARN_ON_ONCE()), cacheability of the memory is not
  being restored in iounmap().
- The check for RAM pages (except for the WARN_ON_ONCE())
  continues to be applied only to lowmem pages.
- The WARN_ON_ONCE() itself is applied to the pfn after the
  preceding loop finished, i.e. to a pfn that doesn't actually participate
  in the operation. Shouldn't it be moved inside the loop?
Thanks for any clarification,
Jan
