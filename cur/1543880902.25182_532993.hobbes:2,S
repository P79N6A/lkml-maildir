Isn't think a good thing? By decoupling the 2 layers we insulate them
from changes in each other. This allows bug subsystems to concentrate
on topics that important to them instead of worying about refcounting
objects that are not directly interesting for the subsystem in
question.
Now for smaller subsystems it may make sense to embed stuct devices
into subsystem objects and manage it all together. In fact input
system does this but I think it is much simlpier than SCSI or IDE.
