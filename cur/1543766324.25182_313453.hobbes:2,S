To generate those you do:
# cat unsigned_tag
	commit a2755a80f40e5794ddc20e00f781af9d6320fafb
	tag v2.6.12-rc3
	signer Linus Torvalds
	This is my official original 2.6.12-rc2 release
# gpg --clearsign < unsigned_tag > signed_tag # gpg will ask here for the 
secret key phrase
To verify you do:
# gpg --verify < signed_tag
and check exit status.
Hope that helps,
