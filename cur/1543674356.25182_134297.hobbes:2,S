Extended cpumasks for larger systems. Now featuring bigsmp, Summit,
and Voyager updates in addition to PC-compatible, NUMA-Q, and SN2
bits from SGI.
Several minor bugfixes with improper checks of bits and some new
API pieces: cpumask_of_cpu() and cpus_promote() for replacing
1 << cpu and promoting "narrow" cpumasks (i.e. unsigned long) to
full-width, respectively.
Successfully runs on 32x NUMA-Q. Successfully compiletested on Voyager,
Summit, bigsmp, and flat logical SMP, all with typechecking. UP also
successfully compiletested with and without local APIC and IO-APIC.
Hopefully I can get my hands on another NUMA-Q quad or two soon.
vs. 2.5.69-bk14. The patch (too large to post) can be found at
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/wli/cpu/cpu-2.5.69-bk14-1.bz2
I'd be much obliged if (sub)arch maintainers could comment.
Tomita, I didn't have a way of building PC98; if you are negatively
affected somehow I'm interested in hearing of how to fix things up
or any other special handling PC98 might need here.
David & Martin, I'm not 100% sure wrt. what's going on with the IA64
pieces of the puzzle. The more I find out about what you want, the
better.
Thanks.
