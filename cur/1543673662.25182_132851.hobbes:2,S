Watch this space. There's some work happening with 2.4 bug testing with some 
supermount development work and then 2.5 will follow soon enough. The current 
version (call it a fork?) of 1.2.5 has a problem with filesystems that can 
write the same file with different case (eg vfat writing file.c and File.c) 
but can be found at the new sourceforge home:
http://supermount-ng.sf.net
A bugfix for that known bug should be available soon and then it will need 
lots more testing...
