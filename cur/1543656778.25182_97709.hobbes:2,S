FWIW-
We've used three types of GigE cards; old Alteon AceNIC (Tigon 2),
Broadcom/Tigon 3, and the el-cheapo 32 bit Intel e1000s. The Tigon 3 gives
the best performance, but the difference (600Mbps vs 750Mbps 'real-life'
performance) is generally not worth the extra cost if it's only going to be
serving NFS or something-- you probably won't be able to detect the difference.
GigE is now commodity. Check out pricewatch.
