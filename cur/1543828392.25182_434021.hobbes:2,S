Ok, thanks. At least we're making progress.
Could you try on another file, with fewer chars after the dot ? I suspect
that one particular error is reported to vim and that it retries with a
shorter name, for instance to be compatible with 8.3. If this is the case,
the problem might be in vfs_link() (but I don't see why).
