Not the least -- there is no such thing as code "(in)compatible with the
GPL" -- you can alter (or write) GPLed code to do (or don't do) anything
you want when it comes to the GPL. The additional restrictions provision
in the GPL you talk about means restrictions in licensing, not technical
ones. For what it's worth I could alter the glibc to not work when used
by a process called "acroread" or "vmware" or whatever (not that that
would make sense) and still be in full compliance with the GPL as long
as I adhere to the GPL when distributing it.
