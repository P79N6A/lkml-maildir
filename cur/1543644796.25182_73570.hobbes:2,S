The big question is - why that much CPU usage?
Possible answers:
* PHP, mySQL, Apache - needs that amount of CPU to perform the requested 
function.
(you have got suggestions from others)
* The implementation if either has bugs that cause the CPU usage. Garbage 
collection? Ineffective algorithms?
- Not much to do other than collecting execution profiles, quite advanced - 
recompiling of the tools will probably be needed... And probably help from 
the tools developers...
* The implementation of the user code has bugs that cause the CPU usage.
One example:
SQL SELECT with unindexed data - this can usually be noticed as buffer in load 
in vmstat but since all data fits in memory - it would cause scans in memory, 
with lots of RAM cache misses... And it would work well as long as the 
scanned data was smaller than the CPU cache?
- Suggestion: Review your index keys and select statements to make sure that 
they match!
