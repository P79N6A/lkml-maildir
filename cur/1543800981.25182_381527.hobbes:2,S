Hi Takashi,
do you know of _any_ app relying on this behaviour? If not, make
blocking open and blocking read/write different things (as they really
are different things). Maybe create a /proc control, so users can revert
to the olde behaviour if there really is any need.
I simply cannot imagine that any ALSA app relies on this weird
behaviour. I only ever hear how it confuses people [Hang out a bit on
#alsa on irc.freenode.org: "my alsa driver is broken as this and that
app hangs!!!" - "no it's expected behaviour" - "WTF!!!?" ;) <- smiley].
It is also still quite a common case i suppose as when an OSS app has a
device open, the ALSA apps trying to open it in blocking mode will again
hang. Or so i'd think. My soundcard is hw mixing capable (thank god ;)),
so i don't really know, and it's been a while since i hang out regularly
on that channel. If i talk out of my ass, let me know.
Regards,
Flo
