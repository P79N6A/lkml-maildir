IIRC, there was an implementation and analysis in Vahalia. Streamlining it
shouldn't be too hard (I have something like that in AFFS patches, but
there I didn't need {up,down}_write and did need upgrade/downgrade. IOW,
writrs always started as readers). IIRC, Vahalia uses two queues, counters
a-la rwlock_t has and counters of pending readers and writers. down_read() 
blocks if there are pending writers and up_write() either wakes one writer
or (if ->writers==0) all pending readers.
