Backspeeding::
The process of checking the BIOS-chipset settings, against the known
limitation of the chipset, in combination of the device's maximum transfer
rate.
In you case, (if you were using the 4.01 BIOS) the box will crash hard,
while using an drive/device that supports modes faster than ATA-2 or
DMA Mode 2.  The 4.02 BIOS fixes this flaw in the chipset, at a heavy
price.  You have lost the ablity to have/use IOAPIC interrupts.
cat /proc/interrupts
They are all XT-PIC, second the MP reverts to 1.1 verses the 1.4 version.
This is way to high a price to pay to have crumby BIOS support for doing
the very same thing that I can do with chipset code.
I wish that I could show you a report but I have a ATA-33 card with a pair

This is very true as it relates to the 2.2.X kernels; however, a patch
applied with resolve the issues.
