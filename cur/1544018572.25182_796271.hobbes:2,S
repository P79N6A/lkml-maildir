Yes. Fortunately, this is "unlikely" path.

Yes sure. Except this wakeup can be false.

Yes.
It is no that I think this new helper is really needed for this
particular case, personally I agree with the patch you sent.
But if we have other places with the similar problem, then perhaps
it is better to introduce the special finish_wait_exclusive() or
whatever.
