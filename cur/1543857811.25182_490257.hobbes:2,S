No. Life _is_ that easy.
If the 2.6.16 stable tree took a patch that was questionable, and we don't 
know what the right answer to it is from the _regular_ tree, than the 
patch violated the stable tree rules in the first place and should just be 
reverted.
Once people know what the right answer is (and by "know", I mean: "not 
guess") from the regular tree having been tested with it, and people 
understanding the problem, then it can be re-instated.
But if you're just guessing, and people don't _know_ the right answer, 
then just revert the whole questionable area.  The patch shouldn't have 
been there in the first place.
It really _is_ that simple.
Either it's a stable tree or it isn't.
