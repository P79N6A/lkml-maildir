It seems to have been a one-time occurrence.  This patch series fixes 
it.

This series converts the macros to inline functions.

Rest assurred that checkpath is now an integral part of my normal 
workflow.  All the patches in this series pass with flying colors.

Done.
The 1/3 patch fixes the unfortunate code in the serial-core driver.
The 2/3 patch moves the macros out from under CONFIG_PM_SLEEP.
The 3/3 patch converts the macros to inline functions and creates a new
pm_wakeup.h file for them.  They can't remain in pm.h, because they
depend on the definition of struct device -- and the compiler hasn't
seen that yet when pm.h is read.
It's not clear why the can_wakeup accessors are written to work even
when CONFIG_PM isn't set.  Nevertheless, the patches retain that
behavior.
