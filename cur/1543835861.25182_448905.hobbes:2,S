This case is solvable by planning.  When you know that the new fs
must be created with all inodes from the start, simply count
how many you need before migration.  (And add a decent safety margin.)
That's what I do with my home machine ask disks wear out every third 
year or so. The tools for ext2/3 tells how many inodes are in use,
and the new fs can be made accordingly.  The approach works for bigger
machines too of course.
