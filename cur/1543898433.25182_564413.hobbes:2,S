First of all, sigmasks are not widely needed.  Second, why on earth
shouldn't it be possible with a flat structure?  Just have the sigmask
in the same position.  It's no magic.

Nonsense.  Whether you have a new word in the task structure or a
pointer to a structure, you have to embed knowledge of this
indirection in every affected code paths.  There is no difference
here.  The only difference is that trying to force everything through
an artificially complicated common entry code.
I hope that Andrew+Linus will see through this.  I'm done arguing.
