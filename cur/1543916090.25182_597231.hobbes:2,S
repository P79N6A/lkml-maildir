The correct answer is that HAL should top polling while the device is 
suspended.
In kernels starting with 2.6.23-rc6, the correct way to enable 
autosuspend for a USB device is basically like this:
	echo D >/sys/bus/usb/devices/.../power/autosuspend
	echo auto >/sys/bus/usb/devices/.../power/level
where D is the time (in seconds) the device should remain idle before 
it is autosuspended.  An autosuspended device will be woken up to 
respond to polls.  (Note however that in this kernel, autosuspend 
support for USB mass-storage devices was removed because it can 
cause problems related to spinning down disk drives.)
If instead you do
	echo suspend >/sys/bus/usb/devices/.../power/level
it will simply suspend the device immediately.  The device will not be 
woken up automatically and attempts to poll it (or do anything else) 
will fail.
