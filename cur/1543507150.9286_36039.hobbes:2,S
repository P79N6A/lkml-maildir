Howdy,
Received this message on 2.3.15 immediately after hitting ^C in the
middle of a "tar xfz" on the X sources (overwriting what is already
there):
[sroot@oof:/usr/src/x]# untar X334src-1.tgz xc/Makefile
iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/346916170, count=2
I decided to see if I could replicate it:
[sroot@oof:/usr/src/x]# untar X334src-1.tgz xc/Makefile
[sroot@oof:/usr/src/x]# untar X334src-1.tgz xc/Makefile
iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/346916170, count=2
[sroot@oof:/usr/src/x]# untar X334src-1.tgz xc/Makefile
[sroot@oof:/usr/src/x]# untar X334src-1.tgz xc/Makefile
iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/346916181, count=2
Seems like it. :)
"untar" is a silly alias that doesn't support specifying a file to untar,
which is why I hit ^C in the first place:
[sroot@oof:/usr/src/x]# alias untar
set a="!^";set b="$a:e:s/tgz/gz/:s/z/zip/";$b -dc "$a" | tar xf -
It appears to happen with the Linux sources as well.
