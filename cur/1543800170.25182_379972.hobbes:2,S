I didn't back then, just did now, and oh surprise, you are right and I
am wrong... I should have known; after all, *you* wrote kconfig, right?
I checked Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt and it all makes
sense to me now, although I have to admit the word "counterintuitive"
came to my mind at first. I guess it's just a bit hard to switch to
tristate logic when you use boolean logic all day long.
So, I'm sorry for not verifying it all before I answered to you, and
even more sorry for submitting a less-than-optimal patch for inclusion.
He comes a fix. Linus, feel free to apply it now, or after 2.6.15 is
released, at your option - it's no more a bugfix, only an optimization.
Thanks.

Simplify the VIDEO_SAA7134_OSS Kconfig dependency line a bit. Thanks
to Roman Zippel for the suggestion.
