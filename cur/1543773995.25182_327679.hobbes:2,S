Just to make sure I understand you - if I don't squash suid for the
entire name space, a user could mount a malicious synthetic (even with
NOSUID) and then launch an SUID app from an inherited mount which
would then traverse to the malicious synthetic.
That's a nasty case I hadn't considered before -- however, what's the
potential damage there?  The user could hold up progress of the SUID
app that they launched, but that wouldn't necessarily impede system
progress since system-critical suid apps wouldn't be typically
launched by a user.  I suppose there is the possibility that if
multiple instances of such an SUID app share a global lock you could
get into trouble -- do we have any concrete example apps that would
exhibit this kind of behavior?
Are there other vunerabilities that I'm missing?
