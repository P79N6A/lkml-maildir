While linux-fbdev is subscribers-only, non-subscribers are not plainly
rejected, but moderated, so the casual patch/comment/question comes
through.
I'll cook up a patch for MAINTAINERS to clarify.

Tux drawing speed doesn't really matter, as it's done once only.
Console text drawing is different.
`time cat MAINTAINERS' is a good test. Of course, is most time is spent
in scrolling, you won't see much difference.
So probably we need a test file that contains lines of text interspersed
with `HOME' escape sequences, so we don't scroll?

The notion of `FOREIGN_ENDIAN' is relative, as it depends on the
architecture you're compiling for.
Suppose you have a PCI graphics card with a frame buffer that's always
big endian. When compiling for a big endian platform, the driver won't
depend on FB_FOREIGN_ENDIAN. When compiling for a little endian
platform, it will.
Shouldn't we add LITTLE_ENDIAN and BIG_ENDIAN Kconfig vars first, just
like we have 64BIT?

I'd like to handle this in Kconfig (cfr. above).
