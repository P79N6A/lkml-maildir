Ahh!
Should we make it so the header printed by show_state is aligned properly 
with the data?  If yes, please consider the below patch.

[PATCH 2.6.19-rc6] sched: correct output of show_state
At present show_state prints a header the does not match the output of 
show_task, as follows:
-
                                               sibling
  task             PC      pid father child younger older
init          S 00000000     0     1      0     2               (NOTLB)
-
This patch corrects the output of show_state so that the header is 
aligned with the data, ala:
-
                         free                        sibling
  task             PC    stack   pid father child younger older
init          S 00000000     0     1      0     2               (NOTLB)
