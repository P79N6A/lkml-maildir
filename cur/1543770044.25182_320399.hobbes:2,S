Thanks for the comments!  A bit of a clarification on slab policy - I
did my own find_slab() so I could keep tight control over my own slabs
(and monitor for slab leaks, etc.).  There seems to be similar
functionality for the malloc slabs (kmem_find_general_cachep), but I'm
not sure if this is really something that is generally useful.  What
do folks think?  Is this something that would be generally useful to
add to slab.c?  Or is there something like this that I just
overlooked?
