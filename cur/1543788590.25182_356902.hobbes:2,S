Yes. In fact that caused some of the problems that lead to the investigation 
of this.

You need to audit all architecture code then that fills up possible map.
(at least for the architectures that support CPU hotplug) 
With that change x86-64 could move back to the generic code BTW - 
the numa allocation in the architecture specific code doesn't work anymore 
because we usually find out about the cpu<->node mapping now only 
afterwards :/
