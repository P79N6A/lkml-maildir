An addition to the class idea would be for clients to have priorities.
That would let me mark the bus as being for DDC. The highest priority
client would be the DDC driver. If the DDC driver can't find valid
EDID it could then fall back to letting the EEPROM driver try to find
the chip.
Something like this is important if we get a new EDID standard that
the DDC driver doesn't recognize. By letting the EEPROM driver load at
a lower priority you could still easily get to the ROM contents. Or
does it bother people if we let both EEPROM and DDC load on DDC class
buses?
