Hi Tejun,
After the patch was applied (using 2.6.19.1 instead of 2.6.19, hope
you don't mind) I could play a DVD once. Unfortunately this was not
reproducible, using the same DVD. I have attached the requested log
files for the good and the last bad session. Hope this helps.
Which version of the SATA DVD writer have you received? The label
on my writer says
	H/W:A     Ver:A     September 2006
I hope I don't break any netiquette by posting large log files.
Do I?
Many thanx
Harri
