Come on, we went through all this.  Having to do syscalls for event
retrieval plus the limited channel available for feedback (the POLL*
bits) is to limiting.  This is where the kevent stuff innovated and
really fixed the problems.  Userlevel ring buffers are more efficient.
Yes, a unifying event look is what is wanted.  But it does not have to
be poll based.  Given the right abstraction you can fit in the kevent
technology or similar things.
And seeing all these requirements of this approach: kevent is also
much more resource efficient.  No "one file desriptor per thread per
object".  These are important factors.
