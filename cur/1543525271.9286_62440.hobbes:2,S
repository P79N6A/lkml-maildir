Two options: a wrapper, or modify the suid progs to use libcap. Neither
quite have the elegance of proper fs support though :-/

I think the inheritance mask is applied _before_ any forced capabilities
on a binary take effect. So you need a system wide catch-all so you can be
confident about your bounding set without having to trawl the disk.

I believe that's to discourage use of cap_setpcap rather than it being
perceived as "too powerful". Andrew Morgan had some strong reasons for
this, I'll see if I can dig them out of my mail bucket.
