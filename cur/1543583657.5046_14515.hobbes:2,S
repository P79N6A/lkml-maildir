Subject: usleep magically reduces cpu load?

Why does this use up about 5% CPU (on my system) (pseude code of course)
while (data,size = get_data) {
	write(/dev/dsp,data,size);
}
And this only uses about 0%:
while (data,size = get_data) {
	write(/dev/dsp,data,size);
	usleep(1);
}
I've also tried replacing the usleep with sched_yield() but that did
nothing.
