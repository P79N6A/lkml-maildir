cool :-)
Maybe there's more to come: if we can get CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHED to work 
properly then your Xorg will have a load-independent 50% of CPU time all 
to itself. (Group scheduling is quite impressive already: i can log in 
as root without feeling _any_ effect from a perpetual 'hackbench 100' 
running as uid mingo. Fork bombs no more.) Will the Amarok gforce plugin 
like that CPU time splitup? (or is most of the gforce overhead under 
your user uid?)
it could also work out negatively, _sometimes_ X does not like being too 
high prio. (weird as that might be.) So we'll see.
