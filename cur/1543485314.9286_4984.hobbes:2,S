Net gurus,
There has been a change in the handling of proxy arps which breaks
ppp-2.3.5 and changes the behavior of net-tools-1.46,49,50.  The bug
relates to deleting a 'pub' entry.  In the past one could do:
arp -s 192.168.1.1 01:02:03:0A:0B:0C
of course, the ether address is the real ether address etc.  This is a 
simple network, mind you, don't think pathological case.  Then you
could do:
arp -d 192.168.1.1 
and it would work.  Instead, removing like this yields:
SIOCDARP(pub): No such file or directory
In addition, if the 'pub' entry was created by pppd 2.3.5, when it goes to
shutdown the link and remove the entry it gets:
ioctl(SIOCDARP): No such file or directory(2)
Clearly the same error.  
The entry *can* be deleted, but the interface must be specified, even
though there is only one interface present in my arp cache, i.e.:
arp -i eth0 -d 192.168.1.1 
works.  
Now it seems to me that you all will say to me, fix the tools, use the
proper syntax etc etc, but maybe, just maybe, this change wasn't intended
and can be fixed.  At any rate, if the kernel is not 'fixed' then ppp must
be, and the Changes document is wrong.
David
