Works like a charm.
Why is it though that we need EVIOCSREP, when I can set PERIOD and
DELAY through writing a struct input_event directly to the file
descriptor?  I've been doing that for quite some time, having
softrepeat=1 (I need a quick keyboard, DELAY=120, PERIOD=18).
One typo in the patch:
+#define EVIOCSREP		_IOW('E', 0x03, int[2])			/* get repeat settings */
should be:
+#define EVIOCSREP		_IOW('E', 0x03, int[2])			/* set repeat settings */
Now, the EV_SND bitmap is still broken.
I don't think it's simply a matter of adding change_bit(code,dev->snd)
in the EV_SND part of input.c.  During a quick test the bitmap
became confused, after setting both bell and tone through writing
a struct input_event to the file descriptor of the pcspkr's event
file in /dev/input/, then setting just bell to 0.
