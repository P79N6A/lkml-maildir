Nice quote John, to bad it doesn't say "This is a *technical* discussion
list only.  Only post *technical* discussions here."  And it says "Stick
to the subject" which, unfortunately, can be interpreted many different
ways.  I'm not saying I like ranting, but if it is subject related,
something should be said. I'll be honest I haven't gone back and read
all of RMS's posts to see exactly how off topic they are, but I just
don't want to see this list going the way of censorship.  I get enough
of that crap living in the US.

I'll agree there that I'd like to see this end, so I promise no further
posts from me.  Oh and in the future, you might want to respond to the
list so everyone can enjoy the fun of a conversation.
(BTW, Nice sig.)
