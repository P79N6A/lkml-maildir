Subject: [ANNOUNCE] ide-patch for 2.2.18(pre)

I have ported ide-patch to 2.2.18-17 and I'm now backporting
2.4.0 changes. New VIA, SLC, OSB4 drivers and MANY other things
are already there.I hope that final 2.2.18-ide-patch will have
IDE functionality equal to this in 2.4.0-test10...
Here is a snapshot (it's not thoroughly audited and tested):

And please cut that bullshit about ide-patch 2.2.x being unmantained.
I don't use 2.2.x kernels anymore so I don't do ide-patches for pre
kernels. But there will be patches for stable 2.2.x. (Although it's
a real pain - I hate doing backporting instead of new stuff).
