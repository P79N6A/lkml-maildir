It works, kind of.
The only remaining problem is that the DMI scan routines are
called _after_ the PnP BIOS scan, so the is_sony_vaio_laptop
variable will be always evaluated to 0 in your patch (causing
the same hang again).
After manually changing is_sony_vaio_laptop to 1 the
patched kernel boots ok, entries in /proc/bus/pnp are present
(not sure how to test if their contents are corect though).
