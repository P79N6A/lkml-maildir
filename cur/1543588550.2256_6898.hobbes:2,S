And all that to support a misfeature present in one legacy filesystem?
Don't forget that find et.al. are going to die on loops in directory
tree, so you'd also need to change large chunk of userland code.
By the way, how would you detect the attempts to detach a subtree by
rmdir()/rename() with the multiple links on directories? Again, forget about
the VFS side of that business, the question is how to check that
required change doesn't make on-disk data structures inconsistent.
As far I know even native (AmigaOS) implementation doesn't handle
directory links correctly. So I don't see much point in allowing them
even for compatibility purposes.
Seriously, screw the directory links - getting the thing work correctly
without them has much higher priority.
