 Eh?  We both get something like:
     [root@babylon linux-2.2.ac1]# ifdown eth0
     [root@babylon linux-2.2.ac1]# ifup eth0
     Error
     No kernel support for devices aliasing[root@babylon linux-2.2.ac1]# 
 Both options for network and IP aliasing are enabled.  IP aliasing is
enabled as a MODULE.
 I still think something is missing-  And I haven't even mentioned the
IDE/SCSI emulation nasty's yet...
