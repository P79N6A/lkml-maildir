As I mentioned in the original email to LKML about -git8, and in
 the first CC to netdev about -git10, I appear to have these files
 in /lib/firmware/tigon. I save every single .config file I used in the
 last, what, four years ?
.config-2.6.28-git10:# CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL is not set
.config-2.6.28-git11:CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL=y
.config-2.6.28-git2:# CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL is not set
.config-2.6.28-git3:# CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL is not set
.config-2.6.28-git4:# CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL is not set
.config-2.6.28-git5:# CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL is not set
.config-2.6.28-git6:# CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL is not set
.config-2.6.28-git7:# CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL is not set
.config-2.6.28-git8:# CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL is not set
-git-2 through -git-7 work
-git8 and -git10 don't work
-git11 works
Clearly the requirement changed in -git8, AFAICS.
thanks,
