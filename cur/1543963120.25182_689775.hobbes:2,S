 correct.

 correct again. As far as I can see, other time related things seem to be OK, including gettimeofday.

 the problem, is not just at bootup and the jumping. During the *complete* lifetime of the kernel I see:
a) the dmesg timestamps jumping back and forth
b) the values are much to small and have absolutely no relation to "seconds after bootup", as they have with 2.6.24 and before.
 But you are right, it might not be a jiffie problem, but a "dmesg timestamp" thing.
