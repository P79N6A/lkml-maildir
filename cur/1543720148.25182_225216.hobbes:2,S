Good.
Assuming that you're signing up to push this baby along ...
Would it be better to remove the ENDIAN specific ifdefs from
lib/bitmap.c, and instead add something like the BIT32X() macro I
described earlier on this thread, in an aside to Mikael Pettersson?
If that macro were defined right in the ./linux/byteorder/*_endian.h
files, then endian neutral code could be put in lib/bitmap.c, and
endian aware code kept in the endian.h files.
Could you extend the cpumask_t API with a corresponding routine?
Mikael - does William's routine look like the makings of something
that fits your needs?
