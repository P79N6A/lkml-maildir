True, it's visible, but it's incorrect dead information which should
be removed. Subsystem != "block is defined as S_IFCHR, and there is no
such char device for pktcdvd. In fact the "dev" file of the pktcdvd
class device points in many cases to a USB device, which must be
fixed.
The whole pktcdvd class is not used at all, besides for exporting a
few files. The "dev" file at the class device is just a bug, and the
MAJOR/MINOR uevent environment variables also. I doubt that there will
be any visible breakage in something that isn't already totally
broken. In short, I doubt, that anything that works today will stop
working if we remove the bugus "dev" file.
This seem like the simple and correct fix for the issue with /sys/dev/
and the broken non-existing but exported pkcdvd char device:
-               pd->dev = device_create(class_pktcdvd, NULL, pd->pkt_dev, NULL,
+               pd->dev = device_create(class_pktcdvd, NULL, MKDEV(0, 0), NULL,
