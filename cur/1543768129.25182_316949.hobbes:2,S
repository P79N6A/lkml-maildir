There's hooks to handle this.  See the security blob in struct
kern_ipc_perm (which is embedded in the various SysV ipc structures),
and the associated security hooks to manage the labels and provide
access control to the ipc objects.  Also, AF_UNIX is handled with
security hooks (see the unix_ hooks).  From that point forward, it's up
to you to label and enforce access control.  SELinux has some supoort
for this type of access control.
