For protocols running HDLC as transport, I can just bridge HDLC frames.  
I would want
to be able to select the channel(s) for the HDLC frames.
For bridging something like voice, I think if I could break out an 
individual channel into
a bit-stream interface, I could just read bits off on one T1 channel and 
write to the other.
Preferably, I could also bond multiple channels (including an entire T1 
or E1) and bridge
it as raw bits too.
I think if I could support these scenarios below, I would have 
everything I need:
*  Configure T1 as unchannelized bitstream, bridge entire thing to 
second T1.
*  Configure channels 1-5 as a bitstream and bridge that to channels 1-5 
of a second T1.  (random proprietary bit-streaming protocol,
                     would probably bridge HDLC just fine, but handling 
HDLC as frames would be more efficient I think.)
    channels 6-10 configured as an HDLC interface, bridged as HDLC 
frames to channels 6-10 of a second T1. (PPP & other protocols over HDLC)
    channels 10-24 each configured as a separate bit-stream, bridged to 
channels 10-24 on the second T1. (Voice)
*  Configure entire T1 as HDLC transport, bridge HDLC frames from one T1 
to the other.
Does that make sense?
Thanks,
Ben
