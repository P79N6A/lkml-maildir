ah, indeed, that makes quite a bit of sense. Almost all of the Reiser3 
code runs under the BKL, and the only other major kernel infrastructure 
that has BKL dependencies is the TTY code. Kasper, as a debugging 
matter, could you try to move that spamassassin workload off into a 
non-Reiser3 filesystem and/or disable PREEMPT_BKL? If that makes a 
noticeable difference (for the better ;) then we can continue figuring 
out what's happening exactly.
