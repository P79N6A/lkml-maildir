sorry, but i have to give you a big NACK on that one:
- no more modparam: it should be per-device sysfs attributes
  (swap_xy is basically only for touchkitusb compatibility and shoud be
   converted to per-device sysfs attribute as well. i just never got to
   do it)
- calibration can be handled in userspace just fine
- even for in-kernel it's in the wrong place. there are other devices
  that report raw absolute data...so it would belong to the input layer
Cc'ing Dmitry Torokhov as he might have some comments about calibration
support in the input layer.
thanks, rgds
