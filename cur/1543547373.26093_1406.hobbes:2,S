Salve,
	That's me again :-) It looks like that I am the only person with
Dell Latitude CPt using Linux 2.4 or nobody before wrote here -- as I
can't find a solution to my problems via the web.
	The next problems are:
1. When I boot up, kernel finishes booting with equally 50% chance. I
mean, that half of the times I power my system on, it hangs and the second
half -- it works. It's a bit strange. Take a look:
	When it loads, some of linux kernel output is like this:
...
Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.11
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
Yenta IRQ list 0698, PCI irq11
...
	When it hangs, however, it displays only:
...
Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.11
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
	Without the next line. I don't know what's wrong on my side --
kernel 2.2.16 worked just fine... There is a possibility, that I'll check
later, 'cause it can be my modification to get_random_bytes that just
returns with exit code 1 instead of writing anything to the text console.
	2. the second issue is not so simple. When I load some modules for
my IrDA to work:
ircomm-tty             18376   0  (unused)
ircomm                  6648   0  [ircomm-tty]
irtty                   5092   2
irport                  4544   0  (unused)
irda                   75201   2  [ircomm-tty ircomm irtty irport]
	and fire up irattach and irmanager (btw, smc-ircc module doesn't
work... Maybe i've got to supply some IO addresses, but I don't know them
and it's my first day of playing with this...) with devices discovery on,
it doesn't discover anything. (If anyone want, I can check if it does emit
any kind of infrared then with my Palm, but for the tests I've been using
Nokia 7110 mobile phone). When I remove my Xircom CEM-56 PCMCIA card from
it's slot, suddenly... there is my phone discovered! And if I put this
PCMCIA card do it's slot, IrDA connection and pc card are working
seamlessly.
	What should I do? Is this a bug? If so, can I help? I am not a
coder... and I'm NOT subscribed to this list (I can't fetch it using my
28k8 dialup connection), so PLEASE CC: every mail in reply to this to
me...
