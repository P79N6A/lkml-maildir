Alan, I agree the VM changes had their issues, bad example, but LOTs of
things have gone into 2.4 which are more impactive than XFS, I just want
to get out of this image of XFS being the filesystem which ate the
kernel.
Yes jfs went in cleanly, because they reimplemented their filesystem
from the ground up, and had a large budget to do it. XFS does not fit
so cleanly because we brought along some features other filesystems did
not have:
  o Posix ACL support
  o The ability to do online filesystem dumps which are coherent with
    the system call interface
  o delayed allocation of file data
  o DMAPI
As it is we did all of these, and we seem to have half the Linux NAS
vendors in the world building xfs into their boxes.
