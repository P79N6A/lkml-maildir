All, IANAL, but:
    #1: take this discussion of this list...
    goto news:comp.software.licensing
    read the FAQ
    if you still have questions send them to mailto:licensing@gnu.org
    if you don't like any of those answers, talk to a lawyer
    be fair, don't steal someone else's work (don't be like Dennis)
    both GPL and LGPL are clear: you change it, you publish source
    if you don't want to publish source, best bet is don't change it,
        just use it the way it is
    you may not have the right to change anything (according to your
        employer): consult a lawyer
