Yes, power.c is an aggregator that transports power events from the
input system into whatever power scheme is in use, so there will
always be a lot of ifdefs unless we will invent grand unified power
interface with userspace. I wonder if we could use kevents.

We could add fix i386 APM case but it looks like most people are
concentrating on ACPI.

There are many more events from ACPI that are not related to input, so
we need to keep it. Still, I can see buttons converted to input
devices which bind to power.c and then transmit requests to acpid
through /acpi/proc/event.
