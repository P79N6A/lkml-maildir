Please don't misrepresent or over simplify my statements.  What
I have said is that meta-data reading and writing should occur in
only one place.  Since, as has already been acknowledged by many,
meta-data updates are required in the kernel, that means this support
should be handled in the kernel.  Any other solution adds complexity
and size to the solution.

Saying how you think something should happen without any technical
argument for it, doesn't help me to understand the benefits of your
approach.

I don't understand your argument.  We have improved an already existing
opensource driver to provide this functionality.  This is not the
OpenSource way?

Again, you have presented strategies that may or may not work, but
no technical arguments for their superiority over placing meta-data
in the kernel.

There will be less lines of code total for any vendor that decides to
add a new meta-data type.  All the vendor has to do is provide a meta-data
module.  There are no changes to the userland utilities (they know nothing
about specific meta-data formats), to the RAID transform modules, or to
the core of EMD.  If this were not the case, there would be little point
to the EMD work.

No.  DM already works on any block device exported to the kernel.
EMD exports its devices as block devices.  Thus, all of the DM
functionality you are talking about is also available for EMD.
