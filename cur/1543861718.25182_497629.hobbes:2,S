I went looking for documentation on how to use the alternates feature,
and found an email from September 2005
(
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0509.1/2860.html
) that
says:
<quote>
/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/$u/$tree
Of course, you may have more than one such $tree. The
suggestion by Linus was to do (please do not do this yet -- that
is what this message is about):
$ cd /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/$u/$tree
$ cat /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6/objects \
>objects/info/alternates
$ GIT_DIR=. git prune
</quote>
Are these instructions still correct in the case of master.kernel.org?
Regards,
Nigel
