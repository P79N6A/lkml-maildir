You are missing where the backporting is.
If the time between big merges increases, as with this proposal, then 
the distance between local dev trees and linux-2.6 increases.
With that distance, breakages like the 64-bit resource struct stuff 
become more painful.
I like my own "ongoing dev tree, ongoing stable tree" proposal a lot 
better.  But then, I'm biased :)
