It is not checked, when it is useless to check it. It is supplied with
correct addresses and protocols and it has no reasons to fail.
You are right, certainly. If some devices do fail to digest
valid information, it should be repaired.

It is absolutely wrong. It must not touch skb->protocol!
If it wants to report error, it should return negative value
and reserve necessary room, probably filling the space with necessary
control/error information.

Do you want to say that transmission of "incompatible frame types"
in several exceptional situations eats some CPU? 8)8)8)
Do not be silly, we will lose by several order more time checking
this return value.
It does not cancel the fact, that it should be fixed yet.
