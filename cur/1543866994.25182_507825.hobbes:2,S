 But Gujin need the real-mode part linked at zero and there isn't
anything linked at this address in the current Linux kernel, no
section at all. If you ask to do a separate link then I loose all
the symbols and the ELF standard tools are a lot less useable.

 The linker also resolve relocation in virtual addresses so this part
 needs virtual address = 0.

 There is plenty of possible future, but right now I have a simple
(OK, not perfect, but code is shown) solution which works.
I can modify bits, but there is no point complexifying the system
for possible theoretical problems - by experience you always miss
important future problem while overdesigning for some problem which
never appear.
If someone can show me a real problem - then I'd like to hear from him,
but ELF compatibility will not be up to the point where the user will
be able to run the kernel from a Xterm command line.
  Etienne.
