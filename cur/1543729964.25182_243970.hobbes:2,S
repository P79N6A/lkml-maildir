That is not much of an intelligible idea. A way to hack the kernel could be
found as I still presume. "Turn off checksums" but not by re-writing the
whole tcp code in the kernel. Isn't that possible ? Linux is an operating
system of infinite possibilities, right ? But only if you know how to hack
it...

Maybe dust off some old Pentium 133 and replace that piece of electronic
crap with decent Linux machine?
