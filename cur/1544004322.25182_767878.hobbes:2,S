The person who originally wrote sgiioc4 has been gone for a long time.
I'm guessing that the DMA error is cleared there, because any DMA error
status has already been processed above, and it's easier to clear
unconditionally than to test and clear, and there's no ill effect to
clearing something that's already clear.
