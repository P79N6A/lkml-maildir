	I'm having the same problem with a Wearnes 32X IDE as well, it works with data
CDs, but when I try to play an audio CD, all I get are lots of repetitve status
and error messages (when I turn them all on).  One thing I've noticed with mine
is that if I try to mount the audio CD first, after I get the obvious error
message, most times I'm able to play the CD (ejecting doesn't work though, dunno
about door locking).  I've tested with up through 2.2.0pre4 and still have the
problem.  Anything I can do to help find the problem, just let me know (but be
warned I'm still relatively new to Linux).  Thanks.
