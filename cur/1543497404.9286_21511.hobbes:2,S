Perhaps there's a way round it that fixes the problem without
sacrificing performance...
 1. Split the kernel time counter into TWO values.
 2. The first value is a long long value that specifies the kernel
    boot time in seconds since origin. Since this value is only set
    once per kernel boot, performance is not an issue.
 3. The second is a long that specifies how many seconds since the
    kernel last set the first value.
This changes the definition of the associated Y2K-type problem, and
the problem would then exist ONLY for a 32-bit system whose uptime is
rather more than 68 years.

ELKS is basically a Linux port that runs on XT's, never mind 286's,
and development is still going ahead.
Best wishes from Riley.
