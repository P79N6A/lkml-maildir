True, but... I can easily see the situation when ->foo() and ->bar()
both call a helper function which needs BKL for a small piece of code.
->foo() callers take BKL (and it's choke-full of places that still need
BKL, anyway). ->bar() is called without BKL. Moreover, grabbing BKL
over the whole helper is a massive overkill.
ObUnrelated: fs/super.c is getting to the point where it naturally
falls into two files - one that deals with mount cache and all things
vfsmount-related, mount tree manipulations, etc. and another that deals
with superblocks. Mind if I split the thing?
