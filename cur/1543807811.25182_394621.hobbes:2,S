You have to do it if you want to keep using the setjmp interface.

For security reasons.

It's not needed.  There is no reason to look at the content of the
struct except if you do something which isn't guaranteed by the spec. 
I'll definitely not add such an interface.  If you need this
functionality, implement it yourself.  setjmp is most likely overkill
anyway.
