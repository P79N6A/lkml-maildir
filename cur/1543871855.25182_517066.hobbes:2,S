I just want to understand why we have issues and to see if how we have
organized the suspend/resume path for dealing with msi irqs makes sense.
That is I haven't looked much at the suspend/resume path so I don't know it
well and I am afraid that your problem might be a symptom of a deeper
problem.

Currently the irq code supports operation without the
free_irq/request_irq.  Since the numbers given are pure linux
abstractions things should it is really a matter of just
saving/restoring the appropriate state.

Yep.

Below is an additional set of warnings that should help debug this.
The old code just got lucky that it triggered a warning when this happens.
