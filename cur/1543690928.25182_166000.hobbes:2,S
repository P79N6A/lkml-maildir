Such things are infinitely difficult.
Moreover, great care is needed - one has to define precisely what it
is this GUID is supposed to be an ID of.
(Is it the ZIP drive? Or is it the ZIP disk?
The 2.4 USB code is broken because it remembers a GUID and thinks that
identical GUID implies identical disk.)
I have a handful of CF/SM cardreaders.
Some of them have no form of ID. Others have an ID.
Then one can insert a CF or SM card into the reader.
Some of these cards have an ID. Some have not.
On the card one usually finds a FAT filesystem.
There may be a label. Or there may not be.
This describes a 3-level situation.
I have also 4-level situations, where the reader is filled with
one of four auxiliary adapters (each with an own ID) and the
adapter then get a CF/SM/SD/... card.
So, yes, we love IDs. And we can always provide them ourselves
as label or UUID or so in the filesystem.
But finding an unformatted unlabeled disk is difficult.
