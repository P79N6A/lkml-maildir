Ok, the first wrap should be a "soft" one, and I assume that people 
really interested are able to get it anyway. Secondly, I dedidedly 
used ".bz2" (bzip2) to avoid non-hackers from using it. I thought 
bzip2 is in recent distributions. (It in in SuSE Linux 6.0)
If time permits, I'll put a ".gz" verson there, too.
