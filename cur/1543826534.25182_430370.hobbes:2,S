Hi,
It seems an effort was made to replace all pci_module_init calls with
pci_register_driver but in -mm it still seems to have pci_module_init
for many drivers.
Does anyone know if this is still in the queue somewhere or if it was
cancelled?  Is pci_register_driver the preferred call to make?
Thanks for any info,
Ivan
