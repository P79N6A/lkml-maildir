Makes sense yes. I'm not sure how much we can push into user space before
we break back compatibility or lose the needed info/security credentials
to take action but it makes sense when possible.

The internal representation is kdev_t, which wants to turn into a pointer
from what Aeb has been saying for a long time. A 32bit "dev_t" is need so
that we can label over 65536 file systems to things like ls, regardless of how
"/dev/sdfoo" is mapped onto a driver
I'm sure that dev_t (the cookie we feed to user space) going to 32bits is
going to break something and I'd rather it broke early
