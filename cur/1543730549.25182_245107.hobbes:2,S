The open source sound drivers do not work as well as the binary ones. 
SPDIF/AC3 does not work in the current ALSA driver and nvidia will not
release the required documentation to get it working.  Worse, the
binary-only driver is an OSS and not an ALSA driver!  Unbelievable.
The network driver had to be reverse engineered.  Apparently nvidia
engineers helped to get the gigabit support and some other features
working, but only after people had to reverse engineer the basic
functions.
Stick with VIA.  Nvidia is not Linux friendly.
