Hi Alistair.
 > Alternatively the ac patches are on all ftp.*.kernel.org sites.
Am I right in thinking that there are no -ac patches to 2.2.8 or
2.2.9, and also that there were none for the 3.3.[012] kernels?
Certainly ftp.uk.kernel.org (aka SunSITE-UK) only has -ac patches
for kernels 2.2.[0-7] and 2.3.3 available.
Best wishes from Riley.
