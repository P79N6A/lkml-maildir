I still think this is bad idea:
1) already existing CPU erratas against popular models. As I learned
   yesterday -- SILENT reboot (often) or hang (rare).
2) new type pretending to be standard and idiomatic -- immediate_t
3) new almost-C-keyword -- immediate_if. What does it mean? You'll never
   guess just by looking at it.
4) numbers! it's very entertaining to look at numbers with 4 digits
   after comma and without any attempts to do error estimates.
5) examples!
	DEFINE_IMMEDIATE_TYPE(struct task_struct*, immediate_task_struct_ptr_t);
	immediate_task_struct_ptr_t myptr;
   this is close to hungarian notation, and threats were made to use
   immediate stuff everywhere.
6) hundreds lines of new code playing with dynamic modifying
For what you ask?
For 1 (one) cacheline saving in schedule() which
unlike getpid/getppid is non-trivial function, so all rosy numbers about
speed savings aren't really applicable. And nobody measured how big it is
on macro benchmark.
So, this stuff should be put into CoolHacks case and put aside.
It just not worth it!
A side note, folks at KS can discuss barrier for merging speed improvements.
My feelings are around 1%.
