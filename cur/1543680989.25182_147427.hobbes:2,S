Hi,
probably a simple question: do we currently do any flow control for
logical subinterfaces (specifically 802.1q VLANs) similar to
netif_{stop,wake}_queue on the main (physical) device?
I notice "txqueuelen:0" on VLAN devices and vlan_dev_hard_start_xmit()
seems to not do any flow control, but I wonder if there is something
else?
The problem is I'm doing the same with Frame Relay, should I add a TX
queue to FR PVC devices and possibly stop/wake PVC device queue in sync
with physical device queue?
Possibly a pointer to faq or something?
