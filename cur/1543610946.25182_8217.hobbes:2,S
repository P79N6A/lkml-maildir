Hi,
still having problems (starting with kernel 2.4.12) with
the /dev/tty device:
When logging in on the console and trying the "ps" command,
is will list  _all_ processes and not only those which are
attached to the controlling terminal. This seemed a little
bit suspicious.
Now, trying
        echo some text >/dev/tty
returns 
        bash: /dev/tty: No such device or address
Now trying the command
        tty
says 
        /dev/tty1
Now, I tried
        echo some text >/dev/tty1
It echoed correctly
        some text
on the console.
Then, I tried
        echo some text >/dev/tty
Now (!!!???) it echoes correctly "some text".
It seems that the cmd
        echo some text > `tty`
will repair something, but I don't no what and why.
-----------------------------------------------------
The above described problem first appeared with Kernel 2.4.12,
I tried the following kernels (now 2.4.16), BUT WITH NO SUCCESS.
Kernel 2.4.10 was _not buggy_.
Additionally, the problem does not arise on all my LINUX workstations,
but only on some. And it does not depend on the harware platform.
And is does not depend on the distribution. Both on RedHat 7.1 ans
Redhat 7.2 having the problem.
