A later version of a kernel may well have discovered new bugs in a previously
considered stable driver. Solving this problem will require the user to 
revert back to an older kernel revision.

Clear api's are good. But consider an api that involves a 'uid_t' for
example. Just now there are attempts to bump this from 16 bit to 32 bit.
A well written driver using that api will work just well after such a 
modification and a compile, perhaps no driver changes required. Your binary 
module will horribly fail or introduce security flaws!

How do you *really* know that a binary driver is functioning.... ?

How do you expect your binary drivers to be better supported? Esp. when the
vendor just introduced that super-hyper-better-new model that you shall buy???
As a side note, I avoid ne2000 where I can because I've already been bitten
by some bad clones.
Oh - and I already dumped a $800 Multi-purpose framegrabber card because the
supplied win3.1/win95 driver never left beta status, a NT driver or specs
don't exist and support was abandoned a year or sth. ago. (the vendor is 
"FAST Multimedia" btw.)

Following this statement your binary modules won't get any higher 
classification, because there are already strong technical reasons why they
*will fail* in the future (or the past).

Who *forced* vendors to support Linux at all?? Who *forces* you to use linux?
Do vendors force *you* to use Windows (because not giving you support/drivers)
for other os's)??
Remember: *Nobody* prevents them selling you binary drivers _yust now_!

Aren't you getting unfair? After all Linux is GPLed - so go ahead and implement
your binary interface ("show us the code") - I'm shure there will be details
that break it in a couple of weeks if not days.
You would have to provide modules dependent on 
- compiler (2)
	there are known incompatibilities between gcc 2.7.x and newer ones
- architecture (5 - I didn't count...)
	the world is not intel-only (my personally most important issue)
- processor (about 2 per architecture, more to come....)
	even inside an architecture these are incompatible, at least from
	a performance pov. (Think of MMX, SIMD etc etc )
- SMP (2)
	lots of things default to /*nothing*/ or are handled differently
	on UP - you dont want that SMP overhead on UP.
	And thinking of your SMP-Compatibility functions you mentioned
	elsewhere: You did realize that the head developers argue a lot
	whether they can use *one* or must use *two* asm-instructions
	to perform a specific task, just to save a few picosecs, didn't you?
	Compare that with a multi instruction parameter passing and
	probably cache trashing function call.
	I would think Andrea says NO WAY! :)
- memory configuration (2-3)
	You don't want the additional overhead of supporting a multi-Gigabyte
	(RAM that is...) machine on your 486 8MB home toy machine, no?
- API-version (?)
	I think even you agree the API has to be changed from time to time
	to support newer/bestter features.
Even more points to add.
That's conservatively counted 80 (!!!) driver modules for a single API - do 
you really think that will get supported???
Does any of your win95 drivers work for 98, NT3.5, NT4, 2000, or 3.1 ?
Imagine: a source driver could even be backported to 2.0 or something
should you need that somehow - a binary one never will.
And note ther _is_ a way to use binary drivers _just now_: it's called modules
and if I understood that correctly they even _have_ a module version which 
makes them refuse to load when it is known that they break. So you _can_ use
them across kernel versions. But all other points remain....

I actually wonder whether you ever have programmed something yourself that you 
still seem to constantly ignore the technical facts presented to you.
Usually I don't participate in flame-wars - but this posting made me angry :-/
