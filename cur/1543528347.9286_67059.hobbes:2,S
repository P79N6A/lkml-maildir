Doing lost_ticks after slow_gettimeoffset is correct and necessary.

That's right, it's a plain minor bug.

It doesn't matter the value at the beginning of 10msec.

So your TSC is are getting crazy or they are not in sync.

Ok so your second TSC have some trouble.

That's not the case. lost_ticks is necessary for both slow and fast
gettimeoffset.

No, lost_ticks has only to deal with the timer interrupt, timer chip latch
and with the xtime settings. It has anything to do with the TSC or with
SMP.
>That would explain why disabling global lost_ticks makes things better.
It make no sense to me that it makes things better.
Since UP works fine despite of the other tests it can only be the TSC of
your second CPU that has hardware troubles even if it's not clear why
using slow_gettimeoffset didn't helped. Certainly there was something
wrong in the changes.
