remember that Hans is on record (over a year ago) arguing that R3 should 
not be fixed becouse R4 was replacing it.
This type of thing is one of the reasons that you see arguments that 
aren't 'purely code-related' becouse the kernel folks realize that _they_ 
will have to maintain the code over time, Hans and company will go on and 
develop R5 (R10, whatever) and consider R4 obsolete and stop maintaining 
it.
