Well, you are probably a lot smarter now that you slept all day :-) 
Any way, this patch helps somethat but it is indeed sick:
first time:
connect(3, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(23),
sin_addr=inet_addr("1.2.3.5")}}, 16) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily
unavailable)
subsequent times:
connect(3, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(23),
sin_addr=inet_addr("1.2.3.5")}}, 16) = -1 ENOMEM (Cannot allocate memory)
With this configuration:
add 1.2.3.4 10.0.0.216 esp 25701 -E 3des-cbc "123456789012123456789012";
add 10.0.0.216 1.2.3.4 esp 34501 -E 3des-cbc "123456789012123456789012";
spdadd 10.0.0.0/24 1.2.3.0/24 any -P out ipsec
           esp/tunnel/10.0.0.216-1.2.3.4/require;
Anything I can do to help, let me know.
Regards,
bert
