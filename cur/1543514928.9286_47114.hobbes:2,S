Umm, the following patch in 2.3.25 is bogus.  SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE and
async_icount are both internal serial structures that should *not* be
exposed outside of the serial driver; they're not part of the exported
interface.

There seem to be other users of these definitions, notably code that was
stolen from serial.c and worked into other drivers; but they should
include serialP.h instead of moving this into serial.h.
