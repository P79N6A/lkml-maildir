At OLS the 'SystemTAP' idea was presented, which has been partially
implemented already, and it builds on relayfs as well. It dovetails nicely
with kprobes.
So it appears there is a sizeable amount of code which is building on
relayfs, iow, it is getting to be infrastructure.
I'm redoing diskstat to work with k/jprobes so it won't require a kernel
patch anymore, but it will still rely on relayfs.
So it would be tremendously helpful if relayfs would be part of the
mainline. I'll be banging out some HOWTO style documentation soonish.
Bert.
