While looking at capability.h, "listen to multicast" is defined as
cap_net_broadcast:
 /* Allow broadcasting, listen to multicast */
#define CAP_NET_BROADCAST    11
However, while fiddling with capabilities, I noticed under af_netlink.c
that apparently this capability is under cap_net_admin:
./linux/net/netlink/af_netlink.c
 /* Only superuser is allowed to listen multicasts */
if (nladdr->nl_groups && !capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
return -EPERM;
Is this intentional? This is using kernel 2.2.14.
