Good summary... ;)
But for the last part of the last item - sometimes, definitely more than
once, I wondered why there's no equivalent to recv(MSG_DONTWAIT) for
non-sockets -- why for sockets it's as simple as adding an option (a
single bit), while for all the rest it requires two fcntl calls...
Sometimes it's handy. ;)
Not that I'm arguing for or against such a feature anyway..
