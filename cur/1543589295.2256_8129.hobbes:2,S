Well, almost.  Here is the scaling code:
#if HZ < 200
#define TICK_SCALE(x)	((x) >> 2)
#elif HZ < 400
#define TICK_SCALE(x)	((x) >> 1)
#elif HZ < 800
#define TICK_SCALE(x)	(x)
#elif HZ < 1600
#define TICK_SCALE(x)	((x) << 1)
#else
#define TICK_SCALE(x)	((x) << 2)
#endif
#define NICE_TO_TICKS(nice)	(TICK_SCALE(20-(nice))+1)
This, by the way, is new with 2.4.x.  As to why, it has more to do with
timer resolution than anything else.  Timer resolution is 1/HZ so higher
HZ => better resolution.  Of course, you must pay for it.  Nothing is
free :)  Higher HZ means more interrupts => higher overhead.
