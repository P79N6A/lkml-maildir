Good catch!  I'm embarrassed that I didn't see that.  
As for "resize=", it seems to fail.  Probably because it doesn't match
the "resize=%u" pattern:
root@tesla:~# mount -o remount,resize= /mnt
mount: /mnt not mounted already, or bad option
Someone posted a patch the other day that supposedly handles both
"resize=0" and "resize" alone..I believe by simply adding it to the
pattern list.
