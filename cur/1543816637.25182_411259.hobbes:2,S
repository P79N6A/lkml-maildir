I've reviewed those modifications, along with the new i2c modules
(ks0127 and bt866), and they're all up-to-standard. I recommend that
those patches be applied to the kernel tree. With those patches, a new
type of card will be supported in the kernel driver.

(I think people commonly just append their IDs to the list at the bottom
of i2c-id.h, incrementally; at least, that's what I did when I submitted
earlier patches.)
