It can't be responsible because the kernel is controlling the RSS size e.g.
by prefetching or swapping out. The process has very little means of
influencing these mechanisms, nor is there a way to actively shrink the RSS.
(It's perfectly legal to e.g. mmap a large file (1 GB) and memcopy that area
into another mmaped file, and the kernel is expected to keep sane even on a
16 MB machine.)
You may introduce a mechanism that allows a process to keep it's RSS < n,
but you'll have to deal with legacy processes at least for the next 20 years.
