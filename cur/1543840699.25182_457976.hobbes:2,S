It prevents the event from occurring as much as a lock taken in the
prepare notifier does, right? Or am I misunderstanding something?

I agree. Where possible these things should be very simple either with
the per-cpu macros, or using local locking (versus one's notifier).
I think there can be some valid use of the hotplug lock when working
with cpumasks rather than individual CPUs (or if you simply want to
prevent a cpu from going down while programming hardware) and having a
new lock and new notifier is too heavyweight. Or do we want to move
away from the hotplug lock completely?
Hmm, so I don't know if I like the idea of a reentrant rwmutex for the
hotplug lock so it can be sprinkled everywhere... call it a refcount
or not it smells slightly BKLish (looks easy but it could be a
nightmare to audit).
