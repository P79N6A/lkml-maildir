Hmm. OK. For some reason my two-year-old GDB and KGDB between them
aren't giving me a sensible backtrace today so I can't see precisely
what's happening. I accused take_over_console because my vague memory of
a debugging printk session the other day led me to believe that was the
case.
take_over_console (actually update_region()) is definitely doing
_something_ bizarre... there have been 34 lines of printk output since
boot, and it's rendering the 34th line 34 times, one on each of the top
34 lines of the new console.

OK; I'll try that in the morning.

Yes, it's fine. The hardware just seems to take a few seconds to
initialise after printing the console/matroxfb-related messages.

Answering that question will require compiling/obtaining fbset for SH3.
Tomorrow.
