Quiesce means from the top (no more commands go from the block layer to the 
device) not from the bottom (commands can still be completed for the device).

We don't wait.  The commands may possibly be completing in parallel with 
recovery.  To address your point, though, that's why the device needs to be 
reset as fast as possible: to preserve what's left of the command order.  I 
accept that for a misbehaving device, this may be a race.

Retries get eliminated.  It should be up to the upper layers (sd or beyond) to 
say whether a retry is done.  Since, as you point out, retries automatically 
violate any barrier, it is probably up to the block layer to judge what should 
be done about the problem.

Actually, I do think that quiescing has an important role to play.  A lot of 
drive errors can be self inflicted indigestion by accepting more tags into the 
queue than it can process.  Quiescing the queue lets us see if the drive can 
digest what it currently has or whether we need to apply a strong emetic.
I'd actually like to add tag starvation recovery to the error handler's list 
of things to do.  In that case, all you do on entry to the error handler is 
quiesce the upper queue and wait a while to see if the commands continue 
returning.  You only begin more drastic measures if nothing comes back in the 
designated time period.
