I don't think so ... I ran across a similar problems when I tried to convert
the vma list to a list-of-lists for what you're trying to use prio_tree
for, I think. The sorry fact is that the that thing is heavily contended,
and doing complex manipulations under it makes it worse ;-(
I vaguely considered being a smarty-pants and doing RCU list-of-lists, but
never got around to it. I'll shove in some backtraces and check out the
sem activity to be sure.
