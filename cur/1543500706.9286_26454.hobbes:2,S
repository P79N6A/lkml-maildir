The thinko which probably confused Matthew also puzzled me for a couple
moments, until I noticed the obvious.  (Since nobody pointed it out, I'm
wasting LK bandwidth here.)
The original README for the kernel recommended that one:
make config ; make dep ; make clean ; make zlilo
The "make clean" never removed version.h before, but it does in 2.2.10.  Oops.
I have a one-button-does-all script that grabs patches from various kernel
archives, untars, patches, retars, configures/builds a kernel, gives it a
unique name (so I can have several 2.3.8 kernels, for example, with separate
non-conflicting sets of modules/includes, automatically resolved at boot
time), adds it to my lilo.config, rebuilds the lilo map, and puts the
system.map into the modules directory.  (OK, so I like it when it takes 5
minutes from the time I see a new kernel on kernel.org to the time I'm running
it.)  But it too fell victim to script-rot; the "make clean" was indeed in
there as part of the build portion.  (Checking the current README, I see that
the "make clean" is no longer mentioned.)  Anyway, if others have created
similar scripts to mine for their own ease of kernel rebuilding, then they may
also have that (now bogus) "make clean" in there.
