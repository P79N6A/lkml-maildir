And cards on other buses (e.g. PCI or SBUS) should be probably initialized
within each category (ethernet, SCSI, etc.) according to bus addresses,
because simply leaving the initialization order on link order will make real
mess in device numbering.
BTW: I wonder if kernel should not use MODULE_PARM macros for kernel command
line (if the drivers provided MODULE_NAME, the option could look like
aha1542=irq=7).
This all has been addressed in Martin Mares' device changes proposal,
unfortunately it has not been coded so far and it is probably too late for
2.4 now.
