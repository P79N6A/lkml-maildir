Ugh... How about relevant subset of strace?

Wait a minute. I don't believe in on-disk file being restored by magic,
but I could believe in page(s) being never written to disk and giving the
impression of "update that doesn't stick". You have a file shorter than
one page, so in principle it seems to point to the handling of partially
truncated pages. Hmm...
BTW, how does test8+patch to block_truncate_page() behave? And what is the
block size on your fs?
