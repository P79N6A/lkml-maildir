But the first thing you must do in a 'roll-your-own' OS is to make
provisions to write text to (sometimes a temporary) output device
and get some input from same. Writing such basic stuff is getting
harder because many embedded systems don't have UARTS, screen-cards,
keyboards, or any useful method of doing I/O. This is where an
existing OS (Like Linux) can help you get some I/O running, perhaps
through a USB bus. You debug and make it work as a Linux
Driver, then you link the working stuff into your headless CPU
board.
