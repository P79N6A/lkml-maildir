If your io is sufficiently limited that one write per file per day is a 
significant problem, then I think there's a more serious underlying 
problem.

The answer to "The current two options are suboptimal in almost all 
cases" is very rarely "Add a new option". If boot is touching too many 
files, it should stop touching as many files. If you have crap disks, 
get better disks. If your life is spent tuning fs parameters for 1% 
performance gains, find a better job.
