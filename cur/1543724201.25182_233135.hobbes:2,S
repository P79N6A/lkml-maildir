So far we have been quite liberal in style questions, what annoys me here 
is that people send warning patches directly to you without even notifying 
the maintainers. If you want people to conform people to a certain 
CodingStyle please document officially in the kernel, sparse isn't 
distributed with the kernel and the sparse police is silently changing the 
kernel all over the place with sometimes questionable benefit. Only the 
__user warnings had really found the bugs, but the rest I've seen changes 
perfectly legal code.
bye, Roman
