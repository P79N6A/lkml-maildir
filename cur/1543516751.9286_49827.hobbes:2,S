Subject: klogd & syslogd slow to shutdown (related to RPC)

Hello,
	We have since kernels 2.2.x (in fact I observed it under RH 6.0
	and RH 6.1) very long time for klogd and syslogd to shutdown
	whenever a NFS partition was busy and hence could not be
	unmounted during the shutdown process.
	They both end up with a bunch of RPC errmsg 101 (or something
	like that), and it takes a really long time before the shutdown
	process continues (sometimes 10+ minutes when 3 or 4 NFS partitions
	are busy).
	Is there a way to avoid that ?
	Thanks,
A+,
