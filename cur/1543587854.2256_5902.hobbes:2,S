PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:0c.0
3c59x.c:LK1.1.13 27 Jan 2001  Donald Becker and others. 
http://www.scyld.com/network/vortex.html
See Documentation/networking/vortex.txt
eth0: 3Com PCI 3c905C Tornado at 0xa000,  00:50:da:06:95:21, IRQ 11
  product code 5957 rev 00.13 date 07-17-99
  8K byte-wide RAM 5:3 Rx:Tx split, autoselect/Autonegotiate interface.
  MII transceiver found at address 24, status 782d.
  Enabling bus-master transmits and whole-frame receives.
eth0: scatter/gather enabled. h/w checksums enabled
	Some more progress: I now downgraded to proftpd without sendfile().
The CPU usage is now nearly 100% (with ~170 FTP users; with sendfile()
it was under 50% with >320 FTP users). But nevertheless, the downloaded
images now seem to be OK.
	Should I try the stock 2.4.3 without zero-copy patches?
