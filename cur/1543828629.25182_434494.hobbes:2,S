I saw it, which is why I hunted down this email.  I hadn't even got that
far into my lkml reading, actually.  You should wait 2-3 days to be really
sure that a bug is being ignored.  Although with one like this, it's a fair
bet that it will be.

No, I tend to think it's better to resort to bugzilla only after a few
days, when the trail has gone cold.
