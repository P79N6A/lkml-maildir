Depending on the cost saving of not saving the registers if they haven't 
changed, vs. the time to take the trap and set the FPU active again, it 
might be a win overall, even if you never used FPU in the kernel. Wasn't 
there a change between saving everything and saving FPU only when used 
"back when?" I seem to remember something about that, and the cost of 
the test vs. the cost of just doing the save.
