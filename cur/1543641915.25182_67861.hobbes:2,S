  No idea.  I have seen these coming from Exim 4.10, Exim-something,
  some sendmail milter (whatever that is), etc..
  Apparently the idea (which I have thought of long ago, and rejected
  as incomplete) has caught, and has multiple implementations...

  I can easily reduce the load impact it causes to vger by
  running the smtp server in "accept everything" mode without
  analyzing local addresses for existence.  With a bit more
  work I can throw in local cache..  (which I probably have to do..)

  Raise some noise all around, there are multiple implementations
  of the idea.  Some even with syntactically invalid tester codes
  (spaces put in place where they don't belong in RFC 821/2821);
  "works with sendmail" is NOT synonymous to "is syntactically 
  correct."
  - a mister at blue-labs.org  runs some sendmail-milter which
    does testing with invalid protocol syntax
  - usw-sf-list1.sourceforge.net  use probably their own code
    usw-sf-fw2.sourceforge.net too...  possibly more systems there..
  - quetz.demon.co.uk tests from  Exim 4.10
  - somebody.symons.net tests from Exim 3.35
  Right now something like 5-7 different systems are doing it.
  Try to imagine when all 3500 targets do it...  BRRRRR...
  (Sure, VGER can handle it, no problem, but it is that much
   wasted cycles, and network traffic...)
