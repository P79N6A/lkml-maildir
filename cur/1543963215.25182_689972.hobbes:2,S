The order of the signed-offs are somewhat relevant, but no, sign-offs 
don't mean authorship.
See the rules for sign-off: you can sign off on another persons patches, 
even if they didn't sign off on them themselves. That's clause (b) in 
particular.
So yes, quite often you'd _expect_ the first sign-off to match the author, 
but that's a correlation, not a causal relationship.
