You're right, it it better to remove ALT+SysRq

This char array is just for output, thees are jsut the keys sysrq has 
defined, in the current
design of sysrq, to add a new key is not easy unless you use an existed 
but unused key,
so this has no problem.
SysRq is just for debugging or emergent handling, so this array is 
impossible to result in
any bad effects, it is just for convenience.
