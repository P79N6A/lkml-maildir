Hi,
I have a n ABit BP6 board with 2 Celeron/400MHz with the latest
released version RU (beta) BIOS, it was released in 2000.
I am running 2.6.0-test10-mm1 at present
and it does not power off the machine. It writes
acpi_power_off called
at the end and stops there. But when I press Alt+SysRQ+o,
it switches off. 1 out of (maybe) 50 occasions, the machine
can switch itself off automatically.
But it worked earlier, I don't know which kernel it was.
I have to pass acpi=force to get ACPI working because of the
BIOS date but it seems to work OK although I get some weird ACPI
status messages during kernel boot. It writes something like
\_PR_\CPU0 is missing from a (don't remember which) table.
