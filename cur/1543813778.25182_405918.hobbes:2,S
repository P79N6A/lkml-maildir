OK, I reread what you wrote and I misunderstood you earlier I guess.
slot->slots[i] does dereference the pointer at the ith entry of slots,
but &slot->slots[i] does not, it will return the same thing as
slot->slots+i, which only dereferences 'slot' (which we've established
to be safe).
Even if &slot->slots[i] did, for some silly compiler, dereference the
pointer, we never actually see it or use it so it should be harmless.
