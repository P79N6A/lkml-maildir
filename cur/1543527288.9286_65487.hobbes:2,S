No memory pressure is exerted on the slab cache, all we
do is agressively reclaim pages that contain unused
entries only...
I think registering a cache with do_try_to_free_pages()
is a good idea. It allows for a more flexible architecture
where drivers can register and unregister caches at their
whim and still have their caches shrunk on demand if there's
memory pressure.
The wanted long-term behaviour is that memory pressure on
caches is directly proportional to the amount of memory a
cache uses, but it's quite possible that the caches can
manage that themselves (with the help of some documentation).

Rik
