Actually, it will.  Intel definitely discourages it, but they'll lock
both cache-lines if the access is unaligned and crosses.  So while they
encourage natural alignment for atomic accesses, I think they also
guarantee that they always work - it ends up being only a performance
issue. 
I agree that it is bad practice, though, and I bet that the x86 is one
of the very few architectures that _will_ do this naturally.
