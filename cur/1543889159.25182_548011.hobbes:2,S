Hmm. That's the code in question:
void __init timekeeping_init(void)                                                                                                                    
{                                                                                                                                                     
        unsigned long flags;                                                                                                                          
        unsigned long sec = read_persistent_clock();                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
        write_seqlock_irqsave(&xtime_lock, flags);  
The rtc_lock is never taken inside the xtime_lock.
Looks like code reordering due to gcc extra magic. Which compiler ? 	
Thanks,
