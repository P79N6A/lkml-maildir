Thanks for your patch. It looks correct to me, but:
It might be that your patch is not fully correct or that you uncovered
another incorrectness, but I started to get problems with my modem tools
(mgetty+sendfax+voice): vm play -s file.rmd plays files half-way only.
I'm back to an unpatched kernel, but I can inspect further, if you want me
to.
