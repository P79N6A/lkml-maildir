agreed, the -H4 patch implements this cleanup:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-O1-2.5.2-pre11-H4.patch
the timer code calls the scheduler_tick() function once per local timer
interrupt. This function then decides whether the current task is idle or
not. (this should also fix the timeslice-expiration bug of any possibly
pid 0 process.)
(there is one small ugliness left, the function also has to be prepared
for a not yet complete scheduler state, rq->idle == NULL and rq->curr ==
NULL. I'll fix this later, it's a detail.)
(-H4 has been sanity-compiled & booted on SMP.)
other changes since -H1:
 - removed dead code from wakeup.
