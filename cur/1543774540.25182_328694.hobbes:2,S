Well, yes, it is slightly confusing, but such patch can go in through
different maintainers, and different pieces can come in at different
times.
If you delete an argument, it is "flag day", and I'll (or you) will
have to coordinate it with akpm as one "atomic" patch.... As lots of
different subsystems (and => lots of maintainers) are involved, I'd
prefer to keep the argument for now.
