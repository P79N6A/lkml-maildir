Dear All;
	This primarily relates to crypto with the loop device under the
international patch.
  Strong io on a crypto loop device cripples my system (486dx2/66); interactive
response is 15 or more seconds, load goes thru the roof, apps like Pine hang
for many many minutes checkpointing a folder, etc. I am wondering if there
is any way to mitigate this other than buying a faster machine. 
	in loop.c: do_lo_request we basicly do this: (pretend in case of write req)
repeat:
  INIT_REQUEST; /* pretend its a write */
  ...
  spin_unlock_irq(&io_request_lock);
  ...
  bh = getblk(lo->lo_device, real_block, blksize);
  --> ... call transfer function to encrypt block; this takes forever
  mark_buffer_uptodate(bh, 1);
  mark_buffer_dirty(bh, 1);
  brelse(bh);
  spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock);
  end_request(1);
  goto repeat
----------
	The transfer function (generally) performs lots of little en/decryptions
(say 4 words) until it has converted the (say 1k) buffer...
	Im very new to looking at the kernel, but would be interested in playing
with this if anyone has any suggestions or advice. (any comments at all
are very welcome.) (My feeling is that the transfer function has exclusive
control for way too long.)
	Next Topic: If I stat the file that underlies a loop device, its st_atime
doesnt reflect io that takes place on the mounted loop filesystem. (rightly
so?)
	Or: How can I tell when io activity last occured on a mounted loop device,
or any mounted fs for that matter?
	What I am getting at here, is being able to unmount or disable a mounted
filesystem after a certain idle time. Simple unmounting is problematic, but
maybe an ioctl to invalidate the loop device...
	Well, again, any thoughts or suggestions would be very welcome.
Paul
