Looks exactly the same thing to me:
pnp: Device 00:01.00 activated.
ALSA sound/isa/sb/sb16.c:313: pnp SB16: port=0x220, mpu port=0x330, fm port=0x388
ALSA sound/isa/sb/sb16.c:315: pnp SB16: dma1=1, dma2=5, irq=10
ALSA sound/isa/sb/sb_common.c:133: SB [0x220]: DSP chip found, version = 4.13
ALSA sound/drivers/opl3/opl3_lib.c:133: OPL3: stat1 = 0xff
ALSA sound/drivers/opl3/opl3_lib.c:444: OPL2/3 chip not detected at 0x388/0x38a
ALSA sound/isa/sb/sb16.c:484: sb16: no OPL device at 0x388-0x38a
I think I have already said that in 2.4 it works, and I have tested both
alsa in the kernel plus alsa sources downloaded from alsa-project, this last
one works in 2.4 but doesn't work in 2.6.
