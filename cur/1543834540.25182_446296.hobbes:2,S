The patch under discussion does precisely this.  (Awkwardly.  Using
kmalloc-pre-object might be better).

Your faith in large kmalloc()s is touching ;) I guess the number of pids
will be smaller for cpusets.

The patch under discussion didn't do this, although it could.  But it still
permits rather a lot of kernel memory to be pinned.
