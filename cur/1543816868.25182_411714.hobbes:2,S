As I see it you might detect a circular lock graph "atomically". But is
that a "deadlock"? Yes, if you rule out signals and timeouts, this
situation does indeed deadlock your program.
But if you count in signals and timeouts your algoritm also gives "false
positives": You can detect a circular lock but when you return from
rt_mutex_slowlock(), a signal is delivered and there is no longer a
circular dependency and most important: The program wouldn't be
deadlocked even if you didn't ask for deadlock detection and your task in
that case would block.
I would like to see an examble of a false deadlock. I don't rule them out
in the present code. But they might be simple to fix.
