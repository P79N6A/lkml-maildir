Hi,
This is the update to the Immediate Values patch. It provides a value with a
load immediate instruction instead of requiring a data load which could hurt the
data cache. It aims at providing a very efficient manner to branch over
compiled-in but mostly inactive code.
This release takes care of the modifications suggested in the previous round of
review (thanks to all reviewers!).
It applies on 2.6.22-rc6-mm1, and depends on the text edit lock patch.
Mathieu
