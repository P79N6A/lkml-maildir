Hmm. Does it freeze, or oops? (ie. were you in X and missed the oops)
Can you get a sysrq backtrace?
Oh, hmm you'll need to increment the refcount of each page before
mapping it. That's probably the problem.
OK, I'd suggest either using vm_insert_page, or converting it all over
to a ->nopage handler then.
