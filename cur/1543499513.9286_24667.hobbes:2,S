Yet again: How do you manage permissions on this cleanly? It has to be
persistent (no "OK, after we boot this tiny script fixes up the whole
mess")? How do you propose to manage default permissions for devices that
might suddenly appear out of nowhere (i.e., USB or hot-pluggable PCI or
PCMCIA or...)? No, "one size fits all" won't do.
I'm not against some devfs type scheme per se, but this is important, and
devfs makes this problem _worse_ without solving much of the other problems
that are there. The current way of populating /dev with everything there
might ever be is broken, but gives you a clean, uniform way of setting
persistent permissions using standard tools.
