i'm sure i'm going to humiliate myself for asking this, but shouldn't
i be able to reproduce the above by just running:
  $ make ARCH=powerpc headers_install/headers_check
we've sort of had this discussion before where, IIRC, you should be
able to generate the appropriate arch-specific headers without having
the corresponding toolchain, no?  so why can't i reproduce that error
on my x86 box?
