Subject: how to add 32/64 compatible ioctls at runtime via module?

I'm working on a driver for 2.6.
I'd like to be able to load the driver as a module, and have it register for 
various ioctl() calls on a device node (which can be dynamic, so no problem there).
I'm not sure how to go about registering at runtime for 32/64 bit compatibility 
so that I can load a module into a ppc64 kernel, and have 32-bit userspace code 
call those ioctls.
Can anyone give some pointers, or direct me to existing code?
Thanks,
Chris
