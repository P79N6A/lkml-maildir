I would expect a tool to refrain from asking for fields with restricted
access if it needs a complete overview over existing processes. It can
always ask for restricted fields in a second request (the vast majority
of fields are world-readable anyway).

Yeah, that makes me nervous. There are just too many ways this can go
wrong or be misinterpreted in user space. Currently, nproc does not
indicate the type of error at all, because a properly written user-space
app will either not hit an error or be able to figure out what the
problem was based on the available information. I suppose if we wanted
to change that (which doesn't sound unreasonable), the proper way would
be to return error flags with an error message (delivered via netlink).
