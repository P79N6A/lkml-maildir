If you don't get feedback, then you have to keep posting. If you still
don't get feedback, try cc'ing a few more lists (eg. linux-fsdevel).

It can be nice to expand on what the problem was, and how you fixed it...
but I guess you do quite a good job in the C comments.

This wasn't exactly clear to me. Did you mean:
 "may be held, which protects generic_osync_inode() from livelocking. If it
  is not held, then the filesystem must prevent this livelock"?

OK, but wouldn't this be better to be done in the actual direct IO
functions themselves? Thus you could be sure that you have the 2b case,
and the code would be less fragile to something changing?
And a minor nit: extra space after "if (unlikely("

These comments updates are for DIO_OWN_LOCKING, right? In that case, you
should mention that.
