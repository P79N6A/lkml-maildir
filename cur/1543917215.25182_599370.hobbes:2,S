You claimed:

Look, when chroot was being designed, I think they intended that even root 
should be unable to get out. They went so far as to say that dot-dot 
wouldn't let you out; and it doesn't.

You were clearly saying that whom you call "they" were the people who 
designed chroot. And it was you who was claiming in this statement that
"they" said it.
The OpenBSD manpage you quoted in this thread states chroot() was added 
in 4.2BSD, and 4.2BSD was released in 1983.
You should therefore either bring a source where the people who designed 
chroot() in 1983 or earlier are stating what you claim they said or 
admit that you were talking utter bullshit.
