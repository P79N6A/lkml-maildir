Yes, i was thinking purely about openDrivers. 
Lets do it this way:
- get all open operating system folks to join
- have an approval organisation, that everyone is happy with
- lets call it "free driver" support
- create apropriate Logos for each operating system i.e. "Penguin-Logo" 
with "free driver since kernel-a.b.c.d" or "BSD-Daemon-Logo" with "free driver
since a.b"
- the hardware version numer (usb-device id, pci-id)? will be held in a
database. 
If in doubt people can look it up there. In case future kernels will
drop support, it can be marked there as well. 
A yearly logo is too much
confusion, since hardware support for open drivers stays pretty long in 
the kernel. (Imagine you license in december - you only got a month...)
Maybe educate people that support for kernel 2.6.x.y series means a 
penguin logo on blue ground. 
If dramatic changes to the kernel are introduced, which all
drivers affect call the kernel 2.8.x.y an educate people about a new linux 
in town and create a penguin logo on yellow ground
- hardware vendors pay someone, or provide source code themselves 
to be reviewed by apropriate kernel folks/bsd board...
- small licence fee and endless advertising possiblilities pay for 
organisation folks and hosting. 
Keeping up database records could help kernel developers.
There could be a log file attached to each device stating the 
current affairs about support in varying OSs
