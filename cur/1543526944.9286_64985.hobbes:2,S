Looks fine (I looked at the URL version). I couldn't have done it
better myself.

In theory, but it doesn't matter because:
- /dev/cpu/mtrr is created during kernel bootup, hence there should be
  no problem with insufficient memory (if there is, there will be
  other problems anyway)
- even if the user-space interface is missing, you still want to go
  through the process of making MTRRs for all CPUs the same.

I don't have /proc/rtc on my machine, but I do have /dev/misc/rtc, so
I don't know where /proc/rtc comes from.
I think we should be strict with the new devfs namespace. If it's not
actually part of the CPU, it doesn't belong in /dev/cpu. If we're not
strict, we end up with the same ad-hockery as /proc.
I'll (reluctantly) be the gatekeeper for devfs names if it means the
namespace is kept sane.
