You've missed an important fact.
A few lines earlier is the code:
	if (stable && !EX_WGATHER(exp))
		file.f_flags |= O_SYNC;
so if ! EX_WGATHER, the file has the O_SYNC flag set and all IO to
that file is synchronous (whether the fs was mounted synchronous or
not). 
If EX_WGATHER, the flag isn't set, and explicitly call fsync after a
short delay.

Whenever you write to a file you change the inode - by changing the
modify time at least.  Look at generic_file_write in mm/filemap.c.
Notice the code:
       if (count) {
		remove_suid(inode);
		inode->i_ctime = inode->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;
		mark_inode_dirty_sync(inode);
	}
If a non-zero amount of data is being written, the inode is marked dirty.
If don't think the test actually serves the purpose as an fsync
doesn't cause the inode to be marked clean. I'm not sure when that happens.

The theory is that you might get 4 write requests inside 10msec.
Each of them enter data into the cache, but don't flush it to disc.
10ms after the first arrives, it causes a fsync on the file.  This
writes out all the data for the 4 requests.  The other requests
eventually finish their 10ms wait, and fsync finds that there is
nothing to write out and so complete quickly.
I didn't write this code and I don't know how well this code actually
works,  but it doesn't seem *wrong*  or harmful in any way.
