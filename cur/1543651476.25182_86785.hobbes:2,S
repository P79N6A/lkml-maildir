How much power does flash eat?  I was under the impression half the reason for 
tiny amounts of memory was to increase battery life in things that really 
should last weeks or months instead of hours (wristwatches, cell phones on 
standby, etc), but I guess that's mostly a question of dram and sram, not 
flash.  (I take it you can read the heck out of it without wearing it out, 
it's just writes that are a problem...  Then again you don't want rapidly 
rewritten bookkeeping stuff in flash, do you?  (Jiffies, scheduler stuff, 
etc, should not be in flash...))
Not my area, I'm afraid...
