Hi,
I was unable to boot 2.5-BK on ppc64 and narrowed it down to the fast
poll patch.  I found:
offsetof(struct poll_list, entries) == 12 but
sizeof(struct poll_list) == 16
This means pp+1 did not match up with pp->entries. Im not sure what the
alignment requirements are for a zero length struct (ie is this a
compiler bug) but the following patch fixes the problem and also changes
->len to a long to ensure 8 byte alignment of ->entries on 64bit archs.
