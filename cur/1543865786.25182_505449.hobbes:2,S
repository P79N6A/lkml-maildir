Most things that sysrq allows you to do are dubious but work most
of the time, and are much better than the alternatives.  Synching and
remounting read-only are several of those, so is rebooting.  If you
look at the emergency reboot path it doesn't do the clean shutdown
that every other reboot path does.
So if it is a maintenance problem I'm inclined to believe there is
a problem that needs fixing.  Otherwise I'm not certain you understand
the point of making thees things available with sysrq.
