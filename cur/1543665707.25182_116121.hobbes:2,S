Maybe I should not react, but let me answer once more.
You do not understand the part about "small steps".
You see a future and ask why I don't jump to the future you
see. The answer is that I take small steps.
Look at the current junk in char_dev.c and cry:
        if (ret && isa_tty_dev(major)) {
                lock_kernel();
                if (need_serial(major,minor)) {
                        /* Force request_module anyway, but what for? */
                        fops_put(ret);
                        ret = NULL;
                }
                unlock_kernel();
        }
Then be happy that it is gone.
You want a different interface? My changes make it easier for you
to get there. Please go ahead.
