That is, Linux turned into a hard real time OS. (Although not
necessarily a very low latency one!) Will this happen? Some people say
there are no such intentions...

Pretty nice. :-)

Why, when it's a "simple" matter of fixing the real time scheduling? Off
course, cache misses and similar problems might suggest that latencies
below 3 ms shouldn't be used for efficiency reasons. That's a user level
choice, though: A little more CPU power, or extremely low latency.

Well... Not what I would call a nice solution, but at least it's better
than external DSP boxes. And if it works with the current kernels,
great! :-) To me, it still looks like a shortcut to get around problems
in the kernel, much like my using RTLinux.

For the processing thread, it's a lot less than 5 ms. A lot less,
because signal processing is CPU intensive, and I want plug-ins to be
able to utilize more than a fraction of the available CPU power. There's
hardly no room for cathing up after a stall under heavy load, so this is
very important.

"Average latency" and "maximum latency" are two very different things.
And as we all know, it's a lot harder to fix the later one, let alone
providing guaranteed maximum scheduling latencies. Which is what is
required. A deadline is a deadline...

Yep... (When) will it be done, and are there any agreed on, acceptable
ways to solve all related problems? If there still are global locks that
may occasionally block out a real time process, it's not good enough,
IMO.
If I knew it wouldn't just result in yet another patch that doesn't get
accepted by the non real time folks for performance reasons or whatever,
I'd be happy to join the effort of turning Linux into a high performance
multimedia kernel.
For now, I'll just work on my engine and plug-in architecture. It will
be moved wherever it can provide the performance I want from it. For
now, that's not Linux user space.

That's a pretty nice answer! :-) That code will be nice reading, if you
don't mind. ;-)

It's a pretty weird one, isn't it? *hehe* (English isn't my native
language, so I can't really tell, I guess.) Anyway, it's pretty handy in
that it's unique. Have yet to find a service where that user name is
taken... ;-)
