I mean - if we use RESET_BAT, I'd expect all config done before to be
lost ... maybe we want this, but won't this kill all the extra touchpad
functionality? We most likely won't be able to read absolute touchpad
values, etc. It might not be possible to use the touchpad with a
touchpoint together with touchpad extra functionality ...
