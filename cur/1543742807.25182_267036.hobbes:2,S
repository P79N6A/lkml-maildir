I'm sorry guys - it seems that the necessary steps were taken in the
last kernel version:
        /*
         * The low byte of FAT's first entry must have same value with
         * media-field.  But in real world, too many devices is
         * writing wrong value.  So, removed that validity check.
         *
         * if (FAT_FIRST_ENT(sb, media) != first)
         */
So I will give it a spin :-)
Sorry once again
