I'm not sure what you mean by self-tuning. Do you mean the scheduling
backoff stuff? Because that makes very little difference on a 16-way
NUMAQ. However it becomes critical for SGI above around 128 CPUs IIRC
so I just kept it in mind when doing sched domains.
The new balancing calculations are definitely a win in my tests. One
tiny regression (the order of 1%) I saw on the NUMAQ was tbench due to
increased idle time. But I'll still take it as a win because we were
doing nearly 1000 times less inter node balancing.
