Dear Friends,
Please give us your valuable comments on this important change to introduce 
a new Metric to measure Load average.
Currently /proc/loadavg reports only the resultant value.
We are doing a scheduling in the Grid project. As a part of that we had to 
do some changes to the kernel
The  problem with the load metric of current Linux/Unix is that it measures 
CPU load and Disk load without indicating the true nature of the load, 
thereby creating some confusion among the readers. For example, if a CPU 
bound task switches on to read a large chunk of disk data, then the load 
average value would still continue to indicate this activity as a load, yet 
the true CPU load during this period would have been zero. This situation 
triggered us to make necessary additions to the kernel so that CPU load and 
Disk load could be reported separately. Further the specialisation of load 
helped our model to perform predictions when there is interference between 
CPU and Disk IO loads.
In the user mode, a new proc file called /proc/loadavgus would collect the 
new data according to a new format which would look like the following,
                 CPU    Disk
Root            0.7     0
User1   0.9     1
User2   0.9     0
User3   1.03    1
User4   0.93    0
User5   1.0     0
What do you think about this change?
Thanks
