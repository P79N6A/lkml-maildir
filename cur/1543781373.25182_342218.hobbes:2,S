Actually after looking back 2.6.13-rc4-mm1 which you say works doesn't
contain any of the later 32/64-bit changes.. so maybe you can try just
applying the git-drm.patch from that tree to see if it makes a
difference...
I'm getting less and less sure this is caused by the drm, (have you
built with DRM disabled completely??)
Do you have any fb support in-kernel (I know you might have answered
this already but I'm getting a bit lost on this thread...)
Dave.
