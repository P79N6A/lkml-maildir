At least for me! in 2.5.70:
1) drivers/char/ftape don't compile( it uses deprecated sti, save_flags
etc ...)
I tried to "fix" it by applying a patch posted some time ago on this
list. It compiled wonderfully but trashed my hard diks even more
wonderfully :(
2)net/core/dev.c spits tons of "fix old protocol handler
pppoe_rcv+0x0/0x150!" to my console to the point of slowing down my adsl
connection by 50%. I "fixed" it by commenting out print_symbol line.Not
very clever but got my old connection speed back whithout any apparent 
ill effect, so ...
3) drivers/ide/pci/hpt336 slows down the disk on it from 35MB/sec in 2.4 
to 24MB/sec. I presume it's the specific driver because for my other
devices on piix the performance is exactly the same in 2.4 and 2.5.
Thanks for listening!
