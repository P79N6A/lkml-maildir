Presumably the problem is that your BIOS marks the IO ports used by the 
floppy controller as reserved which prevents the floppy driver from 
binding to them. (2.6.11 probably was before we even processed PnP 
reserved regions.)
I think we now have handling for the case where the reservations overlap 
PCI devices, but I think it's the first I've heard of them overlapping 
the floppy IO ports..
