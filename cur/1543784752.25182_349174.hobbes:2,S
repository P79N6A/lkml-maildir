Said people who like devfs are lazy and don't like running userspace
programs.  They pretty much also are pretty restricted to embedded
systems.  That's all I have been able to determine so far.  Care to help
flush this profile out some?

My applogies, I used the OSS compatible module for ALSA when I tested
this out.  Hey, might as well use 1990's style interfaces, for 1990's
style kernel features... :)

Hm, ok, ALSA will not work.  Can you point to anything else?  Who cares
about sound on embedded systems anyway...

I'm claiming that the people who insisted that keeping the devfs
patchset outside of the mainline kernel was impossible.  I show how to
do this with 3 calls to "add a node" and three calls to "remove a node",
in a total of only 2 different kernel files.  Such a patch is _easily_
maintainable for pretty much forever outside the kernel tree.  Distros
maintain patches _way_ more complex and rough than that all the time.
That is my main point about ndevfs.
