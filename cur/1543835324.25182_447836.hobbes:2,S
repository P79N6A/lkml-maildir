OK, I take this back. Thinking that it might make a difference to the
second compare, I added a little more to my test program:
---
#define unlikely(x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 0)
int do_func(void);
int a;
int switch_to(int x, int y)
{
        a = 2;
        if (unlikely(x==24 || y==83))
                a=10;
        do_func();
        return a;
}
---
This way I now have a global 'a' and a function that just might use that
'a'.  So this does make a difference:  Kind of funky though. It wastes
space to make it avoid branching when we don't have your total unlikely
(see below):
The above gave:

Which looks the best, so your patch may be good after all :-)
The other tests looked pretty much the same:
  Between (unlikely(x==24) || (y==83)) and
      ((x==24) || unlikely(y==83)) and
      (x==24 || y==83)
which was this: (done with the unlikely(y==83))

So the big savings isn't the branching, but the entire branch is
expected to fail, so it doesn't bother with the duplicate code to speed
things up (see the two do_func calls).  So your patch really just saves
space, and not really speed (but you can argue that this space savings
increases speed by not wasting cache).
So I do give credence to your patch.
