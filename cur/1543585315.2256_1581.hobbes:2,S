I see the *exact* same problem. Large C++ codes, and gcc spending most of the
CPU time in kernel.

Exactly what I see too.   200 MB of memory allocated in 4K maps...
There is an easy fix:  In libiberty in GCC we could change xmalloc()
to do real malloc instead of calloc().   I think that would fix it.
Or glibc could be fixed to make calloc() behave more reasonably
when it's called with tons and tons of 4K allocations.
Or the kernel could be fixed to merge maps.

gcc 2.96 here too.
Should we take this up with the glibc or gcc folks, or should
someone fix the kernel ?
This *is* a very significant performance problem for a standard tool.
