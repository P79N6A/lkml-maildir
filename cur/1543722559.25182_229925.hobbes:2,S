I believe application support is right thing to do... It may not be

Well, that's arguably application bug. Anyway, noone says that right

That's not the right thing.. that way you loose caching effects around
logins even when there's plenty of space.
There's quite a lot of data -- at least on my systems -- that can be
removed with "only" loss of performance...
1) browser caches
2) package lists, downloaded packages
3) object files
heck, if you know you have reliable network connection 4), you could
even mark stuff like /usr/bin/mozilla elastic, and re-install it from
the network when it is needed... Doing anything more complex than 1)
requires extensive changes all around the kernel and userland, and
you'd probably not call that system unix any more.
I'm not saying that "elastic" feature should go into 2.6 or 2.8 or
whatever, but it still seems interesting to me.
