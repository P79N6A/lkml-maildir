Aren't we trying to get away from magic constants like this?  Or at
least a better idea of why batch*3 is better than batch*2?  I will
admit I haven't had the chance to peer into the code, so I'm probably
just being stupid (and lazy) here to speak up.
I guess the real question I have is what happens if we make it
batch*100, how does the affect the algorithm?  And if going from 2 to
3 makes such a difference, doesn't that point to a scaling issue,
i.e. we should have 200 and 300 here, so we can try out 250 as an
intermediate value.
*shrug* Just trying to understand...
