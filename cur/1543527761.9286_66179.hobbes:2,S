Heh, I've tried it with the latest reiserfs and devfs patches. It
was trivial. I remember that I got more rejects when I tried it
some months ago. I was too intimidated then to take a look at the
rejects :)
Ok, here's the solution to the problem. After patching both devfs
and reiserfs into the kernel you get 1 reject file in fs/.
Depending on which patch you apply first your line 21 in
fs/Makefile will miss "devfs" or "reiserfs". Just add the missing
one and you've done.
I think this is too trivial for a patch so I didn't create one.
Regards
Martin
