Thanks!
"[PATCH] token based thrashing control" would be a prime suspect.
None of my infamous VM patches (which did cause random problems) had gone
into 2.6.9-rc1. The first ones were in 2.6.9-rc2.
Well, "[PATCH] make shrinker_sem an rwsem" was in -rc1; I guess that would
be worthwhile testing, if only because it touches vmscan.c
It would be nice to find out what is going on before 2.6.10 gets released,
but Mats isn't going to be able to do any more testing for the moment.
Andrew, what should we do?
