Subject: [PATCH 2.6.17-rc5 0/8] Kernel memory leak detector 0.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a new version (0.5) of the kernel memory leak detector. It is
mainly a bug-fix release after testing it with a wider range of kernel
modules. See the Documentation/kmemleak.txt file for a more detailed
description. The patches are downloadable from (the bundled patch or
the series):
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/patch-2.6.17-rc5-kmemleak-0.5.bz2
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/patches-kmemleak-0.5.tar.bz2
What's new in this version:
- fixed panic caused by some secondary offsets in modules
- removed the panic when not all aliases are found for freed pointers
  as the aliases list can be modified by modules insertion
- following Pavel's suggestion, shortened the function names by
  removing "_debug"
To do:
- more testing
- test Ingo's suggestion on task stacks scanning
- NUMA support
- (support for ioremap tracking)
Note that gcc4 cannot compile the kernels with this patch because of a
bug with __builtin_constant_p (always returning true).
Any bug reports or suggestions are more than welcome as I can only
test it with a limited number of kernel configurations.
Thanks.
