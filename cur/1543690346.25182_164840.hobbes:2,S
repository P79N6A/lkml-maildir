Hi, I'm porting cloop ideas from the 2.4 kernel to 2.6 and I'm basically 
extending the current cryptoloop to support compressors and not just 
ciphers. If someone interested wants take a look 
http://dev.gentoo.org/~lu_zero/gcloop
 contains some patch snapshots, and 
userspace utilities.
It isn't yet completed and the ucl module (that I'm using as 
decompressor) needs to incorporate libucl.a currently, you should copy 
it to crypto/ (probably one of the worst thing to do, but works fine for 
testing).
Regards
lu
