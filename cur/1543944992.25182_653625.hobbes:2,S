Well, the problem seems to be that a "directory" is not just data but
also contains metadata. While it's easy to write data to /dev/null, you
cannot simply discard metadata associated with a directory. So, such a
"/dev/null-directory" would have to remember metadata (at least all
created filenames including subdirectories) in the same way as other
filesystems do. Only file _content_ can be discarded.
To be honest, I still cannot see many sensible usecases for that...
Thanks,
