SIOCSIFMAP is unfortunate, but legitimate - it passes more or less
opaque structure to driver and lets driver interpret it.
SIOCGIFMAP, OTOH, is really bad - among other things, for many drivers
it leaks ioremapped addresses to userland.  And *that* is a LARTable
offense - it's an information that makes no sense whatsoever for userland
code and should never be exposed, just as with any kernel pointers.
What uses ->base_addr from the data returned by SIOCGIFMAP?
