Hi,
I am using mandriva 2007 and gdb that come with it ( 6.3 I think)
I also compiled gdb 6.6, but the same issue persist.
Thanks for the info, and I will try to apply the above patch and see if helps,
Will it make into gdb?
By the way, I had another issue with /proc/kcore.
That enabling sparse memory model instead of flat causes /proc/kcore not to 
work at all. I traced that to a "FIXME" in sparcemem.
/* XXX: FIXME -- wli */
#define kern_addr_valid(kaddr)  (0)
Kconfig should contatin a warning for those who select sparcemem 
that /proc/kcore will be disabled.
or maybe this should be implemented (it is not easy since spacemem allows 
memory to be discontinous, and nobody wants to allow user to read reserved 
regions)
Except the above, /proc/kcore works fine, and it is very usefull.
