OK, well what we have now is a "multi-cpu-per-node-numa-scheduler" if
you really want to say all that ;-)
The question is "does Hammer benefit from the additional complexity"?
I'm guessing not ... if so, then yes, it's worth fixing. If not, it
would seem better to just leave it at SMP for the scheduler stuff.
Simpler, more shared code with common systems.

Right, I realise that the 1 cpu per node case is broken. However, doesn't
this also affect the multi-cpu per node case in the manner I suggested
above? So even if we turn off NUMA scheduler for Hammer, this still 
needs fixing, right?

Yeah, maybe. I'd rather have the code in hand that needs it, but still ...
if Andi's happy that fixes it, then we're OK.
