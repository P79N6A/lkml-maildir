It makes porting to powerpc for instance harder because some controllers
have ack(), and some don't.. Some have mask(), and some don't.. So you
end up with what Sergei is doing which is flat out make ack == eoi ..
Where you have multiple irq chip types each one really needs an
individual evaluation ..
I don't really agree with your method since it increase the porting
effort, and I don't see a gain from it.. In fact the changes that you
make seem like it would be more difficult to support a simple reversal
from a thread to an interrupt context handler, since your permanently
changing the "flow handler" , as you called it, no matter what the
context is. So the person using this code will have to investigate this
new flow handler, which will result is a very anti-climactic ending and
lots of useless work since it's really making ack == eoi (at least for
powerpc).
