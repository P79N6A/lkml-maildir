Hi,
I have just tried to use the kernel via module for my CLE266 and get a
whole load of undefined symbols:
Jan  3 03:08:11 mercury kernel: Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.20
Jan  3 03:12:48 mercury kernel: via: Unknown symbol viadrv_sg_alloc
Jan  3 03:12:48 mercury kernel: via: Unknown symbol viadrv_sg_free
Jan  3 03:12:48 mercury kernel: via: Unknown symbol viadrv_irq_by_busid
Jan  3 03:12:48 mercury kernel: via: Unknown symbol viadrv_control
Jan  3 03:12:48 mercury kernel: via: Unknown symbol viadrv_driver_register_fns
Jan  3 03:12:48 mercury kernel: via: Unknown symbol viadrv_sg_cleanup
Jan  3 03:12:48 mercury kernel: via: Unknown symbol DRM_FIND_MAP
Jan  3 03:12:48 mercury kernel: via: Unknown symbol viadrv_wait_vblank
Jan  3 03:12:48 mercury kernel: via: Unknown symbol viadrv_irq_uninstall
Looking back, this seems to have appeared in 2.6.9 with the introduction
of the capabilities bitmask. The via driver appears not to have been
converted.
I am still trying to understand the new structure. What else does the
missing viadrv_driver_register_fns need to set apart from
dev->driver_features?
Thanks
Mark
