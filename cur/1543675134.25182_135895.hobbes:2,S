I've been able to reproduce the pauses on two different machines/mb/processor,
although each machine has >= 2.5GB ram.  I can reproduce this in 2.4.19, 2.4.20,
and the 2.4.21-rc1/rc2/rc3.
After the machine un-pauses, everything completes/returns to normal.  I don't
experience deadlocked processes.
Both my machines are IDE, using UDMA, hdparam stuff is maxxed; messing with
bdflush, elvtune doesn't make any difference.  Limiting the ram on the machines
didn't help.
Pauses have lasted anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. Anything later
than 2.4.18 is unusable for me because of this.
