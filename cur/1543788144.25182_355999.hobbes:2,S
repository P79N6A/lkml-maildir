You seem to be suffering the same fate as other 'pocket visionaries'
with grand visions on this mailing list. The combination of 'listen to
this awesome idea' (*) and someone who hasn't contributed anything
interesting is not very good. Add a pinch (or more) of 'I know better'
and you've got a great cocktail for a lengthy and tiresome thread, but
not for anything productive.
Why is that so hard to understand? Succesful contributions start at the
technical level, always have.
(*) Such an idea is often described in great text detail, but is often
greatly lacking in technical detail.
