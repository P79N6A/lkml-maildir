I did *lot* of reboots of my Dell D610 machine, with some trivial benchmarks 
using : pipe/write()/read, umask(), or getppid(), using or not oprofile.
I managed to avoid reloading %gs in sysenter_entry .
(avoiding the two instructions : movl $(__KERNEL_PDA), %edx; movl %edx, %gs
I could not avoid reloading %gs in system_call, I dont know why, but modern 
glibc use sysenter so I dont care :)
I confirm I got better results with my patched kernel in all tests I've done.
umask : 12.64 s instead of 12.90 s
getppid : 13.37 s instead of 13.72 s
pipe/read/write : 9.10 s instead of 9.52 s
(I got very different results in umask() bench, patching it not to use xchg(), 
since this instruction is expensive on x86 and really change oprofile 
results. I will submit a patch for this.
