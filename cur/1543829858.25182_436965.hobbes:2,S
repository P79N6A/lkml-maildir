well, I don't agree here. ARCH_PFN_OFFSET is used to save the first
page number that has physical memory. I don't see why we couldn't use
it to correctly initialise the memory system...
If we don't change init_bootmem() to use ARCH_PFN_OFFSET, then the
kernel will initialise the start of memory to 0 which is boggus. IOW,
we can't use this function without this change (except if your memory
start at 0 of course). And I think that init_bootmem() has been
implemented for systems which have only one node _whatever_ memory
start value...
