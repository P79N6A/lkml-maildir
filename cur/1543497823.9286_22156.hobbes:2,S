Do you use SMP? 2.3.5 is not SMP safe in the network code (warning, don't
use it for production!).

Good. I suppose 2.3.5 couldn't sustain a load of 30/33 without major lose
of iterativeness. Also the global performances should be improved a lot.

I have no idea about this. I really think to have changed nothing that may
generate these errors. Is this reproducible? Are you sure this doesn't
happen in 2.3.5 clean right now too?

The set_blocksize message cames from my stuff. In the same condition the
stock kernel was freeing also a buffer with b_count == 1 so 2.3.5 is
hiding a bug in the isofs code that probably is forgetting to release a bh
if the I/O fails.
See the interesting code from 2.3.5, we'll free the bh even if bh->b_count
is 1.
			if (bh->b_dev == dev && bh->b_size != size) {
				clear_bit(BH_Dirty, &bh->b_state);
				clear_bit(BH_Uptodate, &bh->b_state);
				clear_bit(BH_Req, &bh->b_state);
				bh->b_flushtime = 0;
			}
			remove_from_queues(bh);
			bh->b_dev=B_FREE;
			insert_into_queues(bh);
BTW, in the same piece of code there's also another silly thing: if we'll
free unconditionally the buffer, then we can also remove the check for
b_dev and b_size.
This is my set_blocksize instead:
			if (buffer_locked(bh))
			{
				slept = 1;
				__wait_on_buffer(bh);
			}
			if (bh->b_dev == dev && bh->b_size != size)
			{
				if (!bh->b_count)
					put_last_free(bh);
				else
					printk(KERN_ERR
					       "set_blocksize: "
					       "b_count %d!\n", bh->b_count);
			}
			if (slept)
				goto again;
Maybe 2.3.5 is freeing also buffers with b_count == 1 as a feature to
avoid buffer leakage? If so it doesn't look like very robust to me.
btw, I think the bh->b_dev and bh->b_size seems superflous since the
buffer can't be resized or placed over another device under us (mostly if
b_count is 1 while we are sleeping :). (it would make more sense to issue
a panic() if bh->b_dev and bh->b_size changed under us :)
My first guess is that you had a real problem reading I/O from the CD, and
then you triggered a buffer leakage (shown by my set_blocksize) in the
isofs code.
Where is placed your CDWR?
