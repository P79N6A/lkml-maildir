Yes, it has been that way for a year or so.  I was wondering if anyone
would hit any problems in practice.  Have you hit any problem in practice?
I agree that the per-zonification of this part of the VM/VFS makes some
sense, although not _complete_ sense, because as you've seen, we need to
perform writeout against all zones' pages if _any_ zone exceeds dirty
limits.  This could do nasty things on a 1G highmem machine, due to the
tiny highmem zone.  So maybe that zone should not trigger writeback.
However the simplest fix is of course to decrease the default value of the
dirty thresholds - put them back to the 2.4 levels.  It all depends upon
the nature of the problems which you have been observing?
