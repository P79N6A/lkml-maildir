sorry, I meant to say:  The core is in, but the drivers for the adapters in
question are not.  They are part of lm_sensors, and as such, make it very
hard for us to maintain.  I have encouraged the lm_sensors crew to get at
LEAST the adapters/algorithms submitted for general inclusion.  Once that
is in, I will make cobalt_i2c go away.
