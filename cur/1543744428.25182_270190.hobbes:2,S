OK, it's just that it's a pretty common path in the kernel, and if
there was a bug there you'd be very unlucky to be the only one
hitting it. Still, it's possible. Probably the best thing to do is
report it if it happens again.
Oh, what sort of system is it? CPU, how much RAM, etc?
Sorry I can't be of more help.
