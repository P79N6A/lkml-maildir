Since about 2.5.72 the "new?" synaptics touchpad support kills my system.  
I have a Compaq Presario 12XL325, which does have a synaptics touchpad, 
but has always acted like a regular PS/2 mouse.  The last version  of the 
kernel which worked correctly in this respect was 2.5.72 bitkeeper as of 
June 18.  The next version I was able to test was 2.5.73 as of June 24.  
From this version forward I get no mouse at all.  My recollection is that 
the June 18 bitkeeper version had optional synaptics support; including 
it broke mouse support, but compiling it with only ps/2 support enabled 
the mouse support.
