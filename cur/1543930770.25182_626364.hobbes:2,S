Hello,
I think, I'm experiencing the same problem:

A more complete log can be found at:
http://www.e18.physik.tu-muenchen.de/~tnagel/misc/kernel-crash.log
The setup is strikingly similar to that of noah (I'm quoting all of this
by heart, if somebody is interested in more detail, just ask.):
Kernel: 2.6.22 (amd64, Debian patches, tainted)
Mainboard: Asus M2N-SLI Deluxe (nForce 570 SLI MCP --> MCP55, same as noah)
CPU: Athlon64 Dual-Core (same as noah)
RAM: 1GB
HD: 22 x Samsung HD501LJ 500GB (same as noah), 1-6 connected to chipset,
7-22 connected to RocketRaid 2340.
I'm using software RAID like noah, (levels 1, 5 and 6), and like with noah
the problem occurred during RAID check, in my case during heavy NFS load
which had been ongoing for ~4 days.  This is the third time, it has
happened, but only this time I could catch the logs via netconsole.  The
two affected drives are connected to the chipset and show no SMART errors.
Unfortunately, the kernel is tainted since I'm using HighPoint's drivers
for the RR2340.  I don't know whether I can change this easily.
Kind regards,
Thiemo Nagel
