Oh, nothing. Meant the patch is only for i386. Because I do not have any other
setup there were little reason to change for any more arches

Yes idealy, but sometimes a "obvious" name for someone is a uncertain for others
+ if it is suppose to be an boolean, why not decleare it as one. Have seen quite
a few: int a; /* boolean */

Thank god (or someone) for all the C fans who codereview ;)
Have you actually seen code like that (please point me to the place in that case :)

I just took the smallest alternetive to a bit. Many uses an unsigned char as
boolean, others who uses integer should not suffer either (none of whom I have

Oww, it should be u1 (unsigned 1-bit). Thanks!
