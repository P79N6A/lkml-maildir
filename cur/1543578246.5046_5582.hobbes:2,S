LT,
Will this maddness insure that the granularity of the request will be
dependent to the k_dev_t?  Specifically, can one make KIOBUFS do the
sizing of buffer to match the ideal or specified size limits imposed by a
given block device?  Otherwise I will need to design an sub-request layer
to reduce the pain of restarting the entire request because of the huge
DMA-PRD-Chain that has no clue how to report error location and allow a
restart from NxPRD's before the error.
Cheers,
