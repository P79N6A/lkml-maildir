Yes.
I think the tunables, if needed at all, should be set by modifying
the struct and the call might as well be:
bool __printk_ratelimit(struct printk_ratelimit_state *state)
Another quibble is not directed to your change because it's
preexisting but "tok" isn't a good name and may not even need
to be in the structure.  It does save a multiply though.
I think that anything that attempts a printk is slow path
so it doesn't matter much though.
