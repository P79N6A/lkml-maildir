True, but basically, the machine itself does not CRC a block in memory,
but the drive CRC's a block on disk. So if you're having memory trouble,
in most machines it will go unnoticed.

Memory bits usually flip in DRAM, not in transit.

If you have repeated CRC errors, halt that damn thing entirely to have
somebody look after the hardware.
