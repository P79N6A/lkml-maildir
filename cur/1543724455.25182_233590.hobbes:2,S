Oh and here are two different ones:
5ms non-preemptible critical section violated 2 ms preempt threshold 
starting at add_wait_queue+0x21/0x82 and ending at add_wait
_queue+0x4a/0x82
3ms non-preemptible critical section violated 2 ms preempt threshold 
starting at exit_mmap+0x1c/0x188 and ending at exit_mmap+0x
118/0x188
