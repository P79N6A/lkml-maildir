I've created a patch created against Debain's 2.4.27 kernel sources,
which adds ata_piix support to the 2.4.27 kernel.  Its pretty klugey,
but at this point it at least *seems* to work.  Here's a link.

It is a combination of one of Jeff Garzik's patches and the scsi code
from the 2.4.31 kernel.  I've probably broken about 2 million
principles with respect to code maintenance.
I bet some of you are wondering why in the world I would do this.  I
did find a half dozen patches that were previously posted to this
list, but I couldn't get any of them to work correctly, starting from
the 2.4.27 source.  For various reasons, I'm stuck with that
particular kernel.  I'm posting because I'm hoping that this might be
useful to other people in a similar situation.
