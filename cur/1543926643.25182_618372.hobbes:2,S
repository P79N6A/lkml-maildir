Rafael,
Looking at commit:
	831441862956fffa17b9801db37e6ea1650b0f69
	Freezer: make kernel threads nonfreezable by default
it seems that you broke the apm emulation driver.
You removed PF_NOFREEZE flag setting in apm_ioctl(), which is
definitely not part of the apm kernel daemon but instead is called by
user space proccesses...
I'm just reading this code for the first time so I can be wrong but it
looks like it's not going to work anymore.
Could you confirm ?
		Franck
