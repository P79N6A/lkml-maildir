I looked at how node_distance() was called from page_alloc.c and sched.c but I 
overlooked that those results are really only used at init time.  So the 
backing mechanism of patching the SLIT is right but sysfs is way to late for 
those uses and creating a boot option is as you say ugly.  It would be great 
if BIOS just did this for us and correctly but what do you really expect 
that ;)
I would be happy to add it as a boot option if there is any popular support 
for the idea.
