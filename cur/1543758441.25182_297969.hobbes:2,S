my point was that even specifying the exact byte count was not sufficient.
e.g
strace sdd if=/dev/zero bs=32k of=/dev/null ivsize=41234    gives:
......
munmap(0x46a000, 4096)                  = 0
_llseek(3, 0, [0], SEEK_SET)            = 0
_llseek(4, 0, [0], SEEK_SET)            = 0
read(3, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 32768) = 32768
write(4, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 32768) = 32768
read(3, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 8466) = 8466
write(2, "sdd: Done with input volume # 1."..., 33sdd: Done with input volume # 1.
) = 33
write(2, "Do you want to continue with inp"..., 53Do you want to continue with input volume # 2 (y/n): ) = 53
that is, it requests exactly ivsize bytes (for iso cd's this can be got from isosize).
even this was not good enough....
