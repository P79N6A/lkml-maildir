Hi,
    As I see the i386 bootsect code evaluates into 32 bit code.
Could anybody explain me what is the reason ?
32-bit code is in most cases a bit larger (one byte per statement)
but in the bootsector every byte is very valuable. Are there any problems
with 16-bit code? (compilation? non-working on some machines?)
What are the advantages of the following code:
        movw    $128, %cx
        subw    %si, %si
        subw    %di, %di
        cld
        rep
        movsl                   <------- 32 bit
instead of
        movw    $256, %cx
        subw    %si, %si
        subw    %di, %di
        cld
        rep
        movsw                   <------- 16 bit
(which is shorter), etc.
I hope, nobody will joke saying it is faster ...
Regards
   Andrzej
PS. IMHO, using 32-bit code in bootsect.S/setup.S makes sense only
    if it is really necessary to handle 32-bit addresses/data or it
    is shorter. Am I wrong?
