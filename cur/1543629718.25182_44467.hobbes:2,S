That's true.

#2 and $4 are cleanups, #1 and #3 are bugfixes.
And iput deadlock fix is too big of a change for 2.4.19, so it is not included.
Let's see how will it behave in 2.5 first.
And cleanups are harmless ones, so there is no risk of getting these in.
In short, these changes are not "huge", and mostly non-intrusive.
