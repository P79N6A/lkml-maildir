I forgot to make my point here and that was that if X could be split in 
two neither half would need to be reniced.  As a very low CPU bandwidth 
user the input half would get along just fine like the other interactive 
tasks that you mention.  And the output put part isn't adversely 
effected by not having a boost so it would get along just fine as well 
and you don't want it having a boost when it's in a CPU storm anyway.
Of course, if the interdependence between the two halves is such that 
the equivalent of priority inversion occurs between the two threads. 
However, that might be solved by making the division between the two 
halves on a dimension other than the input/output one.

PS I think that the tasks most likely to be adversely effected by X's 
CPU storms (enough to annoy the user) are audio streamers so when you're 
doing tests to determine the best nice value for X I suggest that would 
be a good criterion.  Video streamers are also susceptible but glitches 
in video don't seem to annoy users as much as audio ones.
