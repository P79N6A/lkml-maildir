Mmmm.... documentation.  Yummy.  ;)
When I submitted the original patch, someone wanted to add the ff's
check as well... to reduce the number of people who make that
suggestion, perhaps the comment should read:
+ * Check that the Ethernet address (MAC) is not a multicast address or 
+ * FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (by checking addr[0]&1) and is not
00:00:00:00:00:00.
+ *
Does that make it clear that both cases are covered by the one test?
Hmm... I used __inline__ because the other function in the same
headerfile used it...  What is the difference between the two, and is
one depricated now?  (And what about in 2.2.x?)
