Having debugged a stack corruption problem when attempting to use USB
on a PPC 4xx machine, which was due to improperly aligned DMA buffers,
I am well aware of this issue.

Ok - now I begin to see the point of this: I was being misled by the
emphasis on a preference for consistent allocation and the original
"alloc_consistent" name you suggested.  When consistent memory isn't
strictly required it's as likely as not that it won't be preferred
either.
Given this, and Miles example, I can see the point of a DMA mallocater
that applies DMA constraints that are not to do with consistency.
Then consistency could also be specified, but that's a separate issue.
So, to remove the misleading emphasis on the point of the allocated
being consistent memory (your name change was a start, this goes
further), I'd prefer to see something like:
void *dma_malloc(struct device *bus, unsigned long size, int flags,
		 dma_addr_t *dma_addr);
Which returns virtual and DMA pointers for a chunk of memory
satisfying any DMA conditions for the specified bus.  Then if flags
includes DMA_CONSISTENT (or some such) the memory will be allocated
consistent in addition to those constraints.
If DMA_CONSISTENT is not specified, the memory might be consistent,
and there would be a preference for consistent only on platforms where
consistent memory is actually preferable (I haven't yet heard of one).
