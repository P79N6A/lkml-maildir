Yeah and we spent most of those 10 years reinventing wheels in order to make
them free.  There are people doing interesting things with X rendering and
the ideas behind it. Some of them have been at it since Linus was a small
child. The TinyX server framework also lets you hack arbitarily interesting
card drivers into a nice easy framework. 
There are also folks like the directfb people who've implemented something
Rasterman ranted about ages ago - which is using the 3d hardware subsystem to
render windows as rectangular textures.
I've seen exactly _one_ X project that is justifiably seperate. Thats weirdX
and its separate because its in Java. If you like the idea of
