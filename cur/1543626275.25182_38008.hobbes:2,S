If this has already been discussed, then just ignore me, but
I have a 2.4.19-pre5 kernel with preempt-kernel and lock-break 
patches applied.  When I unmount ext2/3 filesystems I usually 
get a hard hang.  About the only message I get is:
  kjournald[125] exited with preempt_count 1
2.4.19-pre4 with same set of patches does not have this behaviour.
I'm not convinced that its confined to ext3 as unmounts of an
ext2 /usr partition without a journal caused a hard hang as well.
