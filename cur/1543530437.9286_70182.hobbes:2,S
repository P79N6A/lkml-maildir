actually, we do have something like this in the kernel, and it was added
some time ago, it's the 'BUG()' macro.

this is more readable i believe:
	if (!spin_is_locked(&kernel_flag))
		BUG();
we have been adding such asserts since early 2.3. Btw., the dentry-assert
should be done in namei.c and dentry.c, not open.c, this is how i caught
the bug.
