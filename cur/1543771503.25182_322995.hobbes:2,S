Ananda,
These devices should work fine with the standard drivers.
Make sure you configure your X server for the keyboard's extended protocol 
(mine is "microsoftinet", most Logitech keyboards are compatible with this). 
This will allow you (automatically) to use the extended access keys. KDE 
certainly supports this automatically, I have no doubt GNOME does too (at 
least!).
Your mouse's buttons should all be mappable with the standard "ExplorerPS/2" 
or "usb" mouse protocols in X. Like the windows drivers, you can configure 
special buttons or keys to perform just about any task you like.
I hope this helps.
