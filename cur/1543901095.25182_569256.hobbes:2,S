no need for this.  unless you add the header to header-y in the Kbuild
file it's not exported to userspace at all.

Nack on this one. linux/*.h should never include asm-generic headers.
Either put the !CONFIG_IMMEDIATE code directly into this file or let
every arch have a one-liner immediate.h that includes the asm-generic
one.  The first method is probably a lot nicer.

Why is this non-static?

static void _immediate_update_range(const struct __immediate *begin,
		const struct __immediate *end)
same for a few more functions here.

please put all this code into a single ifdef block.
note that the exported functions probably want some kerneldoc documentation.
