What about reading POSIX which says 
1264 [EXDEV]
1265 Improper link. A link to a file on another file system was attempted.
So if the link creates a file on NOT another filesystem (which is the point 
of bind mounts), it should NOT return EXDEV.
Having an artificial boundary between different views to a fs may happen to 
be a security feature if used with care, but most users do expect the 
opposite and wonder why mv is needlessly slow. I'm not even sure if 
defaulting to having a barrier is sane at all, but if people confuse 
filesystems and mountpoints^W^W^W^Wuse this feature, they will depend on 
this feature not changing:-)
