It all happened at home while i was at work and the machine there went
down due to hardware failure, so i have no logs at all.
(It has a maxtor disk that sometimes just hangs... )

Yes it recovers, it only happens during high I/O with rtorrent.
In this case, downloading a 8gb image at ~6mb/s.

I don't think it's a kernel memoryleak, my suspicion is that the kernel,
for some reason, doesn't want to return the cache when it needs more
memory. Perhaps due to the read and write patterns that rtorrent
creates.

Ok, this ONLY happens with rtorrent and large images...
I'll try to reproduce it locally as soon as my schedule permits.

Yeah, i remember reading about that, thats why i upgraded =)

I just hope that something worthwhile comes out of it =)
PS. Perhaps i should have mentioned that all writes goes to a RAID5
array. but i doubt it matters..
DS.
Wow, i really need caffine =)
I/O, I/O, I/O off to work I go
