Under 2.5.x I seem to be getting a lot of fs errors on fsck, mainly
dealing with bad inode counts in groups. Just now though, I had /var
remounted read-only due to the following:
t_transaction: Journal has aborted
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,9)) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,9)) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,9)) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
...
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,9)) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,9)) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,9)) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
And again, on reboot into single user mode and a full fsck bad inode
count errors were present. There were no errors detected whilst testing
the disk with -c.
Under 2.4.x my filesystems never showed errors.
I'd provide more info but this is all that I have. If you need more then
you'll need to tell me what to do to get it. :)
Thanks.
