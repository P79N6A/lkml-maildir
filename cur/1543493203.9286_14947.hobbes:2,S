In which case, it would still FAIL the test - didn't you notice that I
very specifically stated that the test was for EQUALITY with the time
of last boot.

The kernel will still know that it's seeing the WRONG timestamp, so
will revalidate as required...

Neither is required. Each binary gets checked ONCE after EVERY reboot,
which means the checking will have MINIMAL affect on performance.

Are you saying that the time of last reboot is untrusted? If so, then
there's nothing that can be trusted on your system...

Please provide a SENSIBLE method by which the file can forge the EXACT
time that the system was last rebooted. So far, you've only managed to
produce a series of examples that all fail the test...

WRONG !!!
The 'x' bit only says that the file should be regarded as executable,
and provides ZERO information on how to load the executable when the
user asks to run it.
If you don't believe me, try the following:
 1. Find a web page on your system. Any web page.
 2. Set the 'x' bit on it.
 3. Type in the path and name for the relevant file.
 4. Watch Linux REFUSE to execute it because it doesn't know how to,
    despite the fact that it has the relevant 'x' bit set.
I've just tried that on this system, and it royally failed to 'run',
contrary to your claim...

What on earth for? Why on earth should a file that's never used
between boots be checked to ensure that it can run? I've certainly
never proposed that...

I don't suggest anything, YOU are the one making that suggestion. Can
I suggest you start by checking how s[gu]id perl scripts CURRENTLY
work before you start accusing me of things I have neither done nor
said...

No such thing - a pessimist by definition assumes that an idealist is
always wrong...

Agreed, and that's what everybody except you appears to be trying to
do. I'm curious why you aren't?

I don't believe this necessarily follows from the previous comment.
Yes, the kernel has to be involved, but the idea of 'capabilities in
filesystem' does NOT automatically follow - indeed, I'd say that such
was definately undesirable in most circumstances.

Who's offered a kludge of any sort? I haven't - all I've offered is a
step on the way there that allows one to explore some possible means
of introducing capabilities into Linux without automatically breaking
anything...

Why do you think I was so careful with my definition of the first step
towards moving to the desired target?

Nope, that's entirely up to the tools that do the RESTORE stage of the
procedure, and the BACK-UP stage should be completely transparent to
them if it's to have any meaning whatsoever...

I like the Linux implementation of UNIX, but I do NOT like the version
of UNIX that Tandy supplied under the name XENIX (not to be confused
with IBM's XENIX, which worked differently again).
As far as UNIX in general goes, I've yet to come across anything that
can be even considered a standard when it comes to system security,
other than the idea of having users log in and restrict what they can
do depending on who they are. Every different dialect of UNIX that
I've met does the restricting in a different way to all the others...

I'm still waiting for you to provide ONE example of why my proposed
step will PREVENT us from getting there.

Presumably so you can have a go at cracking them, and them blame it on
me for publicising them. Sorry, I'm not that daft...
 > Note that there are _no_ huge security risks involved there!
Not at the moment, no - but if we did capabilities the way YOU want us
to, there would be LOTS of security holes introduced on systems all
over the place, resulting in Linux promptly getting a reputation for
being an extremely insecure system. Sorry, I'm not daft enough to
believe the sort of claims you've been putting out either...
