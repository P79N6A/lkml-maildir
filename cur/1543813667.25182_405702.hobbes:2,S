It might be a wrong gcc optimization which generates bad code. If you're
working on such an old kernel (about 5 years old), maybe you're using
and old, broken compiler too ? gcc-2.95[.1], gcc-2.96, 3.0 and 3.1 have
been known to produce bad code for a long time. Also ensure that you
pass the "-fno-strength-reduce" option to gcc.
Anyway, if you're starting a new dev, I would suggest using a more
recent kernel : 2.6.1[56] or 2.4.32 if you need 2.4.
