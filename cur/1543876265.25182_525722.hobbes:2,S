Right, but "when things get added" doesn't correlate well to
"when they should get suspended/resumed".  It's also in basic
conflict with runtime PM models, where devices may be suspended
at essentially any time.  And sysdevs are even stranger.
One way out:  rather than constructing that list as devices get
enumerated, it could be constructed by a (linear-time, non-recursive)
walk of the device tree(s) before they get suspended.
(Or equivalently:  construct lists at enumeration time, but just
adding them *right after their parent* rather than at the end of
the list.)
Would that solve the problem here?  Potentially ... if the tree is
structured to meet Thomas' rules:

If each of those were a device node, with "clocksource" suspend/resume
methods handling Thomas' "timekeeping" item, and simlarly for "clockevent"
devices ... I could see that all working neatly.
