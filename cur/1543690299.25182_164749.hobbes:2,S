Well yes, that might be true for a one user desktop system. But
shouldn't we meet the demands from the "data center" users as well? Now,
I do hereby claim that: 1000 process/threads doing 128Kb reads is
_absolute_ not the same as 1000 process/threads doing 4Kb disk reads in
terms of i/o, memory and bus bandwidth. 
Anyone willing to bet on this one?
Bottom line - don't waste unnecessary bandwidth, others might need it.
