I would vote against doing that.  Or at the very least don't overwrite one
that might already be there.  I, for one, have a very specific makefile in
my build (object) directories.  Anyone sufficiently skilled to be building
kernels outside the source tree, and/or those with the specific need to be
doing so will already have makefiles and/or shell scripts to suit their
needs.  Making the option a user specified target ala "make makefiles"
would be a better/safer choice; if the user wants or needs a makefile in
their object directory, then they have a simple option to make themselves
one -- no knowledge of GNU Make necessary.
And in my case(s), the source and object symlinks will be of no value.  The
next "bk pull" and build invalidates those links.  And once the kernel(s)
are installed on their respective target machines, there won't be any
source or object trees.
