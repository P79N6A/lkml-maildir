Hi Pierre,
I am using a Transcend SDHC 8GB SD card, with mmc-spi driver in
Linux-2.6.28. When inserting the card, the messages shows the card
capacity is "3.51 GiB":
"mmc0: new SDHC card on SPI
mmcblk0: mmc0:0000 SDC   3.51 GiB
 mmcblk0: p1  "
While fdisk shows correct capacity:
" fdisk -l /dev/mmcblk0
Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 8068 MB, 8068268032 bytes
249 heads, 62 sectors/track, 1020 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 15438 * 512 = 7904256 bytes
        Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks  Id System
/dev/mmcblk0p1               1        1020     7873349  83 Linux
"
So I think there are something wrong with mmc-block code.
Could you please have a look? (I am not on the LKML btw).
Best Regards,
