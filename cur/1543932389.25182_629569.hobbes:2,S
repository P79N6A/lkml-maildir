Booting RHEL 5 i386 in kvm with -no-kvm-irqchip -smp 4 will hang in 
udev.  I bisected this to a change in the _guest_ kernel:

So, guest kernels prior to this commit will hang in kvm smp; after this 
commit they will boot fine.
While the change mentions that it fixes a time warp bug, it also says it 
should be rare.  So clearly kvm smp tsc handing is buggy.  Ingo/Thomas, 
(or anybody else), do you have any insight as to what kvm can be doing 
wrong to trigger this behavior?
