I do not remember having touched the Random Number Generators or Character
Devices anywhere in this series.
Don't worry, I have paid attention (or at least I hope so ;-) to 
'm'-able options, for example the SCSI, IEEE1394, or I2C stacks.
But, for example you will see
 [*] Old CD-ROM drivers (not SCSI, not IDE)
which is because this entry in itself does not generate any object file.
Generally, I just made the 'menuconfig' entry have the same state 
(bool/tristate) as the original entry. If I have overseen that 
somewhere, please let me know!
Thank you,
Jan
