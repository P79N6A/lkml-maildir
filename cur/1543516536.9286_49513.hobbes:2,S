Well, my point was that BSD 4.2 didn't have an equivalent of
e2fsprogs, so they read the raw disk, and Linux dump, being a direct
port, ended up doing the same thing.  I think modifying dump to use
the e2fs libs makes perfect sense as it'll be much easier to keep up
with changes and enhancements in the filesystem.
