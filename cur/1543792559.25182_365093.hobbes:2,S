Pass by value in C:
do_some_stuff(arg1, arg2);
Pass by reference in C:
do_some_stuff(&arg1, &arg2);
This is very obvious what it does.  The compiler does type-checks to  
make sure you don't get it wrong.  There are tools to check stack  
usage of functions too.  This is inherently obvious what the code  
does without looking at a completely different file where the  
function is defined.
Pass by value in C++:
do_some_stuff(arg1, arg2);
Pass by reference in C++:
do_some_stuff(arg1, arg2);
This is C++ being clever and hiding stuff from the programmer, which  
is Not Good(TM) for a kernel.  C++ may be an excellent language for  
userspace programmers (I say "may" here because some disagree,  
including myself), however, many of the features are extremely  
problematic for a kernel.
Cheers,

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.   
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by  
definition, not smart enough to debug it.
