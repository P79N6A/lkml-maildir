I'm hitting an annoying bug in kernel 2.6.11.5
Every time I _reboot_ (warmstart) my pc my two network cards won't get
recognized any longer.
Following error message appears on my screen:
PCI: Enabling device 0000:00:0b.0 (0000 -> 0003)
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:0b.0[A] -> GSI 19 (level, low) -> IRQ 19
3c59x: Donald Becker and others. www.scyld.com/network/vortex.html
0000:00:0b.0: 3Com PCI 3c905B Cyclone 100baseTx at 0x1000. Vers LK1.1.19
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:0b.0 to 64
*** EEPROM MAC address is invalid.
3c59x: vortex_probe1 fails.  Returns -22

PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:0d.0 to 64
*** EEPROM MAC address is invalid.
3c59x: vortex_probe1 fails.  Returns -22
3c59x: probe of 0000:00:0d.0 failed with error -22
This doesn't happen with older kernels (especially with 2.6.10) and so
I've done a binary search and narrowed it down to 2.6.11-rc5 where it
first hits me.
My config, lspci output and the dmesg output of the working and non-working
version can be found at [1]
Feel free to ask if any information is missing or if I am supposed to try
a patch.
