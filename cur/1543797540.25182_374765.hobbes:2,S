Nope, passing -m64 -m32 does not seem to DTRT on native 32bit biarch
toolchain:
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=arch/x86_64/ia32
  gcc -Wp,-MD,arch/x86_64/ia32/.vsyscall-sysenter.o.d  -nostdinc
-isystem /usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/4.0.2/include -D__KERNEL__
-Iinclude  -D__ASSEMBLY__ -m64  -m32  -c -o
arch/x86_64/ia32/vsyscall-sysenter.o
arch/x86_64/ia32/vsyscall-sysenter.S
arch/x86_64/ia32/vsyscall-sysenter.S: Assembler messages:
arch/x86_64/ia32/vsyscall-sysenter.S:14: Error: suffix or operands
invalid for `push'
etc
That command succeeds if I run it by hand only passing -m32.
