If this is your problem then you should have vetoed the inclusion of 
ALSA into the kernel.

OK, what is your plan to make ALSA non-bloated?
E.g. it's clear that unused code or unused EXPORT_SYMBOL's in the kernel 
are bloat, so I am working on eliminating such bloat.
If you consider ALSA too bloated you should help on solving this issue 
instead of insisting on keeping OSS.
