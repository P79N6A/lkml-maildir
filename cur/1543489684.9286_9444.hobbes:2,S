Subject: Tunneling (I think) causing excessive of unneeded icmp's

Over the last day or two, I setup a linux system to dual boot into 2.2.3
(from 2.0.36) to start getting everything setup for the config changes
required for the new kernel.
After getting ipip tunneling setup on 2.2.3 (the first 2.[12] series
kernel I've used for any length of time), I find I am getting TONS of icmp
messages logged by icmplogd, looks like two for every packet that is
recieved over the tunnel.
Here are the messages:
Mar 12 06:20:51 slacker icmplogd: source route from <addr of other end of
tunnel> [<ip of other end of tunnel>]
Mar 12 06:20:51 slacker icmplogd: destination unreachable from localhost
[127.0.0.1]
The tunnel seems to be working fine, and other than changes required by
the different networking setups between the kernels, the configs are
functionally equivalent as far as I can tell.  The box on the other end of
the tunnel is a 2.0.36 kernel.
Maybe a case got missed in the icmp handling for tunnels?  Why does the
kernel think that packets from the tunnel are source routed?
Any ideas or info would be appreciated.
Evan
