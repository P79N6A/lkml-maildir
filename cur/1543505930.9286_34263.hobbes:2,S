Theorizing about this is good. But not too much. 
Why would you want a guaranteed start time?
When a user presses the "start" button, you would like to be able to
start immediatly playing that raw video stream at 6Mb per second?
If it's a user pressing that button, getting that guaranteed rate of
6Mb per second is essential for the quality of the result. But waiting
for the 3Mb buffer to fill before starting, is not all that bad.
