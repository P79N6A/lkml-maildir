Hi Mike,
This seems to be correct for the configuration.  Hope this would be
same for shced_mc=1 and sched_mc=2 since you would have hacked
mc_capable.
By default, all 4 cores will be 1 group at CPU at sched_mc={1,2} so
that packages are clearly identified in the CPU level sched groups.

Let me try similar experiments on my dual socket quad core system.
I was limiting the threads to 8 assuming that the system will max-out
by then.
Thanks for the updates.
