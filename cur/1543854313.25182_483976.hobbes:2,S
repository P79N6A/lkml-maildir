If it's taking minutes, something is wrong. You should be looking at
more like 10-30 seconds, depending on which implementation you're using,
the speed of your cpu and hard disk and how much ram was saved in the
image. For suspend2, for example, the rule of thumb is
ram_in_use_in_MB() / hard_disk_speed() / 2 seconds + bios time + time to
get to starting the resume
Where hard disk speed is the result of hdparm -t. Assumes LZF
compression (that's the /2).
