So is setting it to a random number considered correct behavior? Any of 
the first three values I mentioned would make sense, but the value I see 
is neither time since resume, time since power-on to do the resume, or 
any of the logical uptime values. That was the whole point of the 
original post, the uptime reported makes no sense at all.
