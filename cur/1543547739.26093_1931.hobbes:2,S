Correct, in fact you have to explicitely state "I place this code in the
public domain" before it becomes so.
I also think it's a logical conclusion that a patch to a GPL'd program is
released under the GPL - even if you don't specifically say so.
The only problem that may arise is whether a "software program"
is treated differently by the copyright laws than a "bugfix/patch".
I know I've heard people say this was the case.
[ Just to give an example that's not the same as this one, but brings out
  issues related to patches and bugfixes ]
Say you voluntarily send a patch to a commercial software vendor without
specifying any restrictions on using it at that time. I seriously doubt 
the courts would rule that you are now a part owner of their program.
