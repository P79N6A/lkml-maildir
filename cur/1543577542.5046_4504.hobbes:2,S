I had a similar situation except I was more interested in the performance
difference. Went from ~4MB/s with the 430HX controller to ~12.5MB/s with
the promise. This on an old Pentium system.

Vanilla 2.2 kernels don't have this support (at least not as on 2.2.18).
If you're not running Mandrake, grab Andre Hedrick's excellent ide patch.
One thing you may like to know. If you want the drives attached to the new
controller to be /dev/hda..., then edit lilo.conf and add
	append="pci=reverse"
to your patched kernel entry. Oh, and if you ever need to bootstrap one of
these puppies with a kernel that doesn't have the drivers, you can use
	append="ide0=0xe000,0xd802 ide1=0xd400,0xd002"
to be able to access the drive attached to the Promise controller using the
standard ide driver.
Hope this helps.
