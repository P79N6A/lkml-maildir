Speaking of sbp2 problems...  Why the _hell_ are we blacklisting on
firmware revision alone?  Especially with entries like "all firmware
with 2.<whatever> as version is broken"...
Case in point: Initio bridge, firmware revision 2.21.  Couldn't care
less about long INQUIRY, doesn't need skip_ms_page_8, *DOES* need
correctly detected cache type.
What kind of chipsets do affected devices really have?
