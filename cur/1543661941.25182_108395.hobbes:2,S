readahead is meant for merging. So in short normally there is no
additional request generated by readhaead. Inter-process merging must
not be forbidden by SFQ.
We also have to choose if to forbid or not outer-process merging. In
theory SFQ would tell us to avoid it, and to only merge in the context
of the same pid, in the common case it should just take care of most
merging, things like dbench aren't going to run well with SFQ no matter
if we do global merging or only per-process merging. Optimizing for
throughput is not the object here.
