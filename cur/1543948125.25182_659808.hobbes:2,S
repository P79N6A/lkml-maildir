I know, but I dont' see how local_irq_save/restore has anything to do
with it, raw or not. There would be absolutely no point checking for
preemption on local_irq_restore() since no one would have been able to
set the TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag while interrupts were disabled...
raw_local_irq_save/restore is only different from
local_irq_save/restore when lockdep is enabled. That's why I don't
understand why you're talking about preemption.

I'm not asking you to do it. I'm asking if it would be a good thing to
do. I said that I can take these patches off your back if you want, but
I want to make sure I don't do anything with them that you disagree
with.

Yes, we could probably do that. Which means we can just remove all the
ifdeffery?

Yes...that would be a clocksource core issue I guess. Better leave that
for later...

Agreed.
