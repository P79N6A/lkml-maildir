Evgeniy I think this part is *important*. I think most readers of lkml are not 
aware of exact mechanisms used in epoll, kevent poll, and 'kevent'
I dont understand why epoll is bad for you, since for me, ep_poll_callback() 
is fast enough, even if we can make it touch less cache lines if reoredering 
'struct epitem' correctly. My epoll_pipe_bench doesnt change the rescheduling 
rate of the test machine.
Could you in your home page add some doc that clearly show the path taken for 
those 3 mechanisms and different events sources (At least sockets)
