I built another kernel with -fno-omit-frame-pointer and output seems to
have worsen a lot now. I am not able to build a kernel without -02. There
seems to be some dependencies which I am sorting out.
With frame pointer support, following is the command line.
gcc -m32 -Wp,-MD,kernel/.ksysfs.o.d  -nostdinc -isystem /usr/lib/gcc/i386-redhat-linux/3.4.3/include -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude  -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -ffreestanding -O2     -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fno-optimize-sibling-calls -g -pipe -msoft-float -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -fno-unit-at-a-time -march=i686 -mtune=pentium4 -Iinclude/asm-i386/mach-default -Wdeclaration-after-statement     -DKBUILD_BASENAME=ksysfs -DKBUILD_MODNAME=ksysfs -c -o kernel/ksysfs.o kernel/ksysfs.c
And the gdb trace has worsened. Trace is not even showing all the calls
as it was showing when kernel was built with -fomit-frame-pointer.
