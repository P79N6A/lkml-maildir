Not all HBA drivers implement a mapping to a SCSI transport, we have
raid drivers and even an FC driver that has its own lun definition that
does not fit any SAM or SCSI spec.
I think the only HBA's today that can handle an 8 byte lun are lpfc and
iscsi (plus new SAS ones).
So, we can't have one "LUN" that fits all, and it makes no sense to call
it a LUN when it is really a wtf.
