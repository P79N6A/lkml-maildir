This unfortunately has two problems:
- Currently glibc API is 32bit gid_t, uid_t. Going for more needs recompiles
even for glibc programs.
On the other hand we have to have some backwards compatibility plan for libc5
programs anyways, if it works well perhaps it could be extended to glibc, but
it isn't pretty. 
- A lot of programs (and I think POSIX too) require these types to be of 
arithmetic type. Unfortunately non gcc compilers (lcc, Tendra C, KAI C++ etc.)
often don't have long long, which requires a structure and breaks this requirement
(glibc has 64bit dev_t, that is where this one was discovered)
