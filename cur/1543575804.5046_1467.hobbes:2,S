The only reason "namespace restoration" is an issue at all is due to the
poor design of hosts.c in 2.2.X kernels.  A better solution would be to
bring in the build hooks from 2.4 so modules and compiled in drivers are
handled the same way - a way that lets drivers do what they want with
their namespace without touching that of any other portion of the kernel.
