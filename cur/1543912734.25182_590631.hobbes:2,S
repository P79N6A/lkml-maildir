The principle with letting a dependency add text to the promts are good.
But the implementation done by Simon with a language extension is not good.
A simple and better approach would be to use the newly added option
support for this and let the backend generate the promtps.
I have not yet tried to cook up a patch for it, but it should be
quite generaic and doable.
config EXPERIMENTAL
	option appendprompt=" (EXPERIMENTAL)
config DEPRECATED
	option appendprompt=" (DEPRECATED)
Then the dependency added will automatically append to the prompt.
It would probarly have be done in two steps. One that introduce a helper
function to retreive the prompt text and introduce it. And next a patch to
add a text if a symbol has a dependency on a symbol with a specific option
assigned.
