Well, I've actually implemented it few years ago and even current modutils
you maintain support that already (see runsize member of struct module and
how is it assigned). __init stuff was not stored in a separate page and was
initially vmalloced together with the whole module, the only vm addition was
a shrink for a vmalloc area where it would free some pages from the end of
the area.
It lived in sparclinux-cvs for quite some time, but Linus have not accepted
it (I've posted several times).
I can dig the patch out of sparclinux CVS if anyone is interested.
