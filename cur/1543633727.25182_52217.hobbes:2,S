I've applied it to my repository, thanks.  I forgot to keep track of these 
issues in the voyager tree when I separated the arch-split stuff.

The thinking currently is that arch/i386 is really PC plus a few exceptions 
rather than a truly generic x86 plus additonal machine architectures, so it 
makes sense under this view that `generic' and PC be the same thing.

To be more consistent with the way arch/arm does it?  Certainly the renames 
can be done easily enough, what does the rest of the list think?
