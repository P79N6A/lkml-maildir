Real world example: JACK clients form an ordered graph and each must
finish processing a chunk of audio before signaling the next client to
start.  The audio lives in shared memory and FIFOs are used for the IPC
between RT threads; when each client finishes it writes a single byte to
a fifo which wakes the next client, etc.
(we have to use FIFOs because signals are too slow and futexes are not
available on 2.4)
Of course write() will not normally be RT safe, as it can call down into
the journaling code or whatever, but on a tmpfs/shmfs writing a byte to
a FIFO takes constant time, so as long as the user makes sure the FIFOs
are set up correctly it's all 100% RT safe.
