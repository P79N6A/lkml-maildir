Yes. Can somebody who actually _uses_ loop send a tested patch, please?
We're not going to break existing user space over something idiotic like 
this. Not acceptable. 
The alternative is to just revert all the loop.c patches. Which I'll do 
unless somebody sends me a tested fix - because as a non-loop user myself, 
I don't have much choice. I assume it is 
   commit 73285082 "remove artificial software max_loop limit"
that introduced the new behaviour. Ken?
