I guess I've rarely come across job descriptions like that.
Lowlevel software folk need to be able to use schematics and
often test equipment, but not design product circuits ... and
circuit designers rarely have responsibility to ship software.
On the other hand, maybe you want your "typical" customer to
be more of a systems integrator than anything else.

Chip vendors supporting Linux drivers for all their hardware.
What a pleasant change!  :)

That's your call, of course.  I was pointing out why the "early"
binding of pin resources is the more usual strategy with Linux.
A "late" strategy is a bit surprising, and has its own issues.

That is, for typical products embedding Linux...

Development boards are usually run differently than product
boards.  All that flexibility in the development boards is
not necessarily a feature in the product version; it costs
space and time, which the application may need.  Being able
to shift costs *early* and then drop them at runtime is a
useful strategy to apply in most places.
And heck -- most development setups get used only with one
card stack at a time, and it's easy to install new kernels
for new stacks.
