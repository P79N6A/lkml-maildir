If the changes to these files are very infrequent compared to nanoseconds,
you'll only need the version during some nanoseconds, and only during
runtime. Having a second-change-within-one-timeframe-flag(*) instead of
versions will be enough to make NFS mostly happy and only penalize your
users for one nanosecond, and it won't force version-keeping into the
filesystem. And besides that, all other filesystems will profit even
without having nanosecond resolution nor versioning (but they'll suffer
for up to a whole second).
