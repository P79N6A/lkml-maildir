Subject: Build error without CONFIG_ACPI for current 2.6 git. (even with recent ACPI BUILD fix)

With current 2.6 (HEAD = 254feb882a7c6e4e51416dff6a97d847fbbba551 ),
I get this on x86 without CONFIG_ACPI:
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0x1a31): In function `setup_arch':
: undefined reference to `acpi_boot_table_init'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0x1a36): In function `setup_arch':
: undefined reference to `acpi_boot_init'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Setting CONFIG_ACIP=y results in a successful build.
[steven@spc0 linux-2.6]$ grep ^CONFIG_ACPI .config
CONFIG_ACPI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT=y
CONFIG_ACPI_INTERPRETER=y
CONFIG_ACPI_BLACKLIST_YEAR=0
CONFIG_ACPI_BUS=y
CONFIG_ACPI_EC=y
CONFIG_ACPI_POWER=y
CONFIG_ACPI_PCI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_SYSTEM=y
I checked that commit 8aadff7dd519800ce7c0e7fb75dcd4438b373134
had been applied, and drivers/acpi/Kconfig looks like it should with
that fix applied.
My incoming mail has been slow, so sorry if this was already
reported recently.
