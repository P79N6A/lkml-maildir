well, i hate to be piling on here, but i just encountered this (i think
it's this) this morning.  i was printing a 145+m file (to /dev/lp0) from
an ide drive and it locked up.  just before the lockup, i noticed it was
very sluggish, as if it were under very heavy load (which is really
wasn't).  this is on an smp-enabled machine (noapic at lilo prompt
because of the usb/pirq(?) problem).  i'm using 2.4.0-test12 on a tyan
tiger 133 (via apollo 133a chipset) mobo.  the machine has 512m memory
and another 512m in swap (didn't notice much swap activity, but i could
have missed it).  there were no messages in the logs.
if there's any info i can provide or tests i can run, just let me know.
