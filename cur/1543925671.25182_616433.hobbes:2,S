I don't like the second sentence very much.  How about something like 
this instead:
+If the device is disconnected or powered down while it is suspended,
+the disconnect method will be called instead of the resume or
+reset_resume method.  This is also quite likely to happen when
+waking up from hibernation, as many systems do not maintain suspend
+current to the USB host controllers during hibernation.  (It's

+using the USB-Persist facility, described in
+Documentation/usb/persist.txt.)
