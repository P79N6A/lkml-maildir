Nope it isn't. But a base-install of most distributions doesn't contain
the rpm-command. But it DOES contain tar, gzip, etc. Right?
It's a silly argument, really, I think. Everyone knows what a .tar.gz
archieve is, thus it'd be most convenient to use that format.
RPM is a nice package-standard, but so is the debian package-system, etc.
Oh well. I hope this won't turn into the same kind of argument that the
RMS-thingie (I won't blame any particular person here, though, I just
think it's gone far beyond what's really sane...)
