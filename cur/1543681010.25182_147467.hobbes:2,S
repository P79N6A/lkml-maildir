If this is your first time running 2.5, that makes sense.  The
modules_install would have taken place running under a 2.4 kernel so
depmod would have called the modutils (2.4) depmod and not generated the
appropriate files.  Calling "depmod -ae" when running under 2.5 should
generate these (stored in /lib/modules/2.5.75/) and allow modprobe to work
again.
Best of luck.

Im not sure but it think it has something to do with the crc32 module: when I got the messages about the missing symbols, I hadn't compiled crc32, after that I compiled and loaded it, "make modules_install" worked like a charm
