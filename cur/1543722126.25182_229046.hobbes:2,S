Hi,
Here is attached a patch to support mpc8272 and mpc8260 (ADS) reference boards with kernel 2.6 (2.6.6)
This code is working right now, but with a stupid bugs if you use both serial ports at the same time (it will be fixed in the near
time). KGDB support must be fixed if used within main kernel console. USB (and probably UTOPIA) support is also planed based on
existing mpc860 code.

Any problem or working reports will be apreciated.
Att. Pablo
