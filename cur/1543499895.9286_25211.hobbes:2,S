I would like to mention that with the same hardware, 2.2.5 works perfect
without corruption here; even when the P5-100 (64 MB) is being misused
dramatically on disk io. I have loops of making a kernel, mandb, updatedb,
news.dayly and hdparm testing running for 4 hours without problems. load
very high, no crashes.
2.2.7 is the next victim to test (runs right now for 2 days) with the same
mentioned disk io activity. it's scheduled this day.
the last crash happened with e2fsck'd disks after a power failure. disks
were announced clean. still quotacheck killed a diskpart completely. again
disk activity.
I don't know why it happens and how, only _that_ it happens. my system is
not overclocked  and doesn't use "too tight" RAM timing at all.
