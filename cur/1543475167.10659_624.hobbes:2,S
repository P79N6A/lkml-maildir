Happy new year to everybody
I've got a problem with paralele ZIP driver:
When I boot linux, I'm able to print on my printer.
When I insert ppa driver, I cannot print anymore with printer
connected on ZIP drive (kernel says lp0 is offline)
If I plug my printer directly on parallele port, it works (with ppa
driver present)
I've to switch off my zip drive to get printer working again.
It doesn't happen under MSDOS, so I thing the ppa
driver makes a bad thing on ZIP drive that inhibits Online detection 
of printer.
