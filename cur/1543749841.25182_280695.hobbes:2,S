Dear Jeff, 
	Many thanks for your reply. I would like to ask you if 
you have some experience with this ? This means if you can point me to a
good how to or some documentation on the net, or maybe 
describe how to do the steps. This just because I tried to instal the
lilo but it gave me an error when I did /sbin/lilo and the root option
was set to /dev/ataraid/d0. I tried once to 
boot the machine with the options like noinitrd root=/dev/hde and it
booted up but then complained that the partitiona are mounted rw and to
give the root password for correcting the errors. After that I rebooted
to give the ro option and it never had booted again. 
Many many thanks for your help.
Best Regards
Sasa Ostrouska
