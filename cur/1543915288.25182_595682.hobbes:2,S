It *does* mention Reyk, if you would bother to look.  The thing which
Theo is kvetching about, and which apparently is enough to cause the
*BSD zombies to start attacking without actually _checking_ _for_
_themselves_ is whether or not Jiri and Nick did enough to work so
they should have their names listed in the headers.  In other words,
all of the megabytes and megabhytes of flamewar is over these two
lines:

Petty, isn't it?  Let's just say it's b.s. like this which is why, 16
years ago, I decided to work with Linux instead of BSD.

P.S.  And yes, before those two lines is:
> * Copyright (c) 2004-2007 Reyk Floeter <reyk@openbsd.org>
and after those two lines is the BSD permission notice.
