Note that on PPC they do not co-exist with the OFW after
the kernel boots up because it's an enormous can of worms
if not downright impossible.
If I didn't need to make certain OFW calls after bootup on
sparc I'd throw away the OFW mappings and image too.
With software replaced TLBs it's an enormous hassle to
coexist safely with the OFW image.  The locking is a
second order issue.
