The idea was to give them something better to use instead of this.
Whether that be if (has_irq(dev)) return; or some other similar
construct, I'm not terribly fussed.

The only relevant thing I found with google was
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/pciirq.mspx
Where it talks about 0 meaning disabled, it says:
	Link Value for INTn#:A value of zero means this interrupt pin is
	not connected to any other interrupt pins and is not connected
	to any of the Interrupt Router's interrupt pins.
which is a different bit from where it talks about the AT-compatible
IRQ numbers.
Everything else I find seems to be talking about Arcnet hardware (!)
