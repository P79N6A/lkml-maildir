Having had time to think, I think there is a discrepancy between
what you say here and the code: If CONFIG_PCI_GOANY=y the code
now goes through BIOS first and then (irrespectively of the
BIOS scan) directly. If going directly isn't nice, wouldn't we
be better off by checking on the return from the BIOS scan
before poking directly?
Examply patch below. If you concur, I will submit this along with
updated documentation to Linus later.
