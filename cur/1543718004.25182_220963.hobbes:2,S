The U320 chips likely work a lot better now if you use driver version 2.0.12.
The AMD chipsets seem to screw up split completions, and this version of
the driver avoids the issue for the most common case of triggering the
bug (transaction completion DMAs) by never crossing an ADB boundary with
a single DMA.
