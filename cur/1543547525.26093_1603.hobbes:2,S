Ok, looking better. I havent been able to forcibly corrupt my mailboxes
like I did before. Yet anyways. I left my machine for about 10 mins and
came back and noticed this...
Sep  3 16:46:29 viper kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device 
Sep  3 16:46:29 viper kernel: 21:01: rw=0, want=1070936764,

Of course I can't tell what drive it was trying to access or anything.
Later, I was deleting all the erraneous dead mailboxes I made from
testing before and I got this....

Hope this stuff help track down the problem. I'm really glad 2.4 hasn't
been released yet. This would have been a killer.
