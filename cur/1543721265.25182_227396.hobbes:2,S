What do you mean "silent"?  I got fixed 15 months ago with the following
changeset:
	
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.4/diffs/drivers/i2c/i2c-dev.c@1.8
It was then fixed even better with the following change:
	
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.4/diffs/drivers/i2c/i2c-dev.c@1.9
almost a whole year ago.

Heh, 2.5 development is dead, no one uses that kernel, just like no one
uses the most recent 2.3 kernel tree.

Yes, this was a security issue a year ago, but has been fixed since
then.  Vendors have released kernels that fix this issue for their 2.4
kernels.  If not, I suggest you contact your vendor.
