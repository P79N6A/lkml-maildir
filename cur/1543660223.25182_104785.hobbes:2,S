Subject: Processes hang in get_request_wait (2.4.18-19-7.xbigmem)

I have a database (IBM/Informix/Ardent UniVerse) that is running on a
Dell PowerEdge 6600 (stats below).  Sometimes when there is a very high
I/O, any database command shell will hang when trying to exit.  A ps
shows that the process is in a get_request_wait.
When the process that is causing the high I/O finishes what it is doing,
then about 5-10 seconds later the command shell that was trying to exit
will finish.  I've read some threads on the list and elsewhere and seen
some patches that refer to "fixing" get_request_wait and
wait_on_page/wait_on_buffer "bugs."
Could mounting file systems onto directories that are only accessible
after another file system is mounted cause an issue (nested mount
points)?  For example I have fs /dev/sdd1 that contains a directory
called 'dbms,' I then mount other filesystems onto directories contained
within dbms/:
/dev/sdd1   /cubs
/dev/sdc1	/cubs/dbms/ACCOUNT
/dev/sde1	/cubs/dbms/16kb
System specs are below.  I would try 2.4.20 vanilla, but for some reason
I get a panic WRT some SMP things when 2.4.20 boots, but that's another
issue that I will try to tackle on my own.
Is there anything that I can try (patches, /proc settings, etc.) to help
alleviate this issue?  Should I reconfigure my mount points?  If more
information is needed, please let me know.
Thanks in advance,
Andy.
