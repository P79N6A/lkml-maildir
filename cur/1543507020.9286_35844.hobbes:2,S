Hi,
i've a BIOS where the APM functionality is within the 0xE000 and 0xF000
segment (PhoenixBIOS) and only the 0xE000 will be mapped so 16bit calls
to the 0xF000 segment let the kernel hang :-( Will this be improved for
the new versions
of Linux ?! A solutions for this problem could be to switch back to
real-mode
before calling the power-donw function from APM-BIOS but i've not the
expirience
make it by my self...
