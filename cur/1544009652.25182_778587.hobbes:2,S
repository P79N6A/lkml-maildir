I considered this approach. Filesystems that allocate buffers for the
name (e.g. XFS) already tend to unconditionally NULL-terminate it, so
this is a non-issue for them. However others (including ext2) do not
allocate a buffer, instead pointing to the in-memory data representing
the on-disk data. If we NULL-terminate in those cases the in-memory
and on-disk data would differ. If the kernel writes out the data for
some other reason (say after updating atime) then we may
unintentionally modify the link target. That may not be a serious
problem in practice, but it doesn't feel right.
However, if the FS maintainers don't have a problem with it, it will
certainly be cleaner and easier to implement than scanning. Opinions?

It is not possible for an uncorrupted symlink :)

Right. If PATH_MAX is larger than PAGE_SIZE no doubt all sorts of
things would start going horribly wrong.
Cheers,
Duane.
