Neither do you with USB. It uses the same SCSI disk driver. Perhaps I'm
missing your reference?
For all of the "standard devices" (this is vaguley defined) it uses one
of the standard device nodes. In the case of USB zip drives, etc it
shows up as the next sd* device.
This is good (consistent) but bad since the device naming is dependant
on order of plugging the device in.
This will not work for USB. devfs (as it stands right now) won't work
for USB either. However, making the appropriate changes to devfs CAN
make it work.
To use standard device nodes would require something similar but with a
mess of kernel code (no one likes that) or creative moving around of
device nodes on the disk.
Since the in kernel solution will probably never be accepted into the
kernel, a daemon is most likely solution.
I'd like to see devfs in the role since it exists already and does much
of the work that is needed already.
I guess it's time to grab devfs and seriously look at what can be done
to do this.
