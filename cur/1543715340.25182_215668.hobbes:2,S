In other words, 80% or more of internet traffic would not be affected
still using http1.0 would not be affected.
And for something like a huge download to just regular joe, this is more
of a nuisance assuming some kiddie has access between you and the
server.
OTOH, long lived BGP sessions are affected assuming you are going across
hostile path to your peer.
So whats all this ado about nothing? Local media made it appear we are
all about to die.
Is anyone working on some fix?
cheers,
