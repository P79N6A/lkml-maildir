Have I missed something here?
Am I being dim?
Or is the usual "instant advice" feature switched off?
The device I am writing the driver for formally didn't support
write-combining and it took
10000 clock ticks to do a partial transfer- now it does support
write-combining and it still
takes 10000 clock ticks to transfer the data- It is performance
critical- How do I switch
write-combining on? It is worth at least a 2x speed up for me?
If it is something obvious please don't be afraid to point it out-----
Thanks SA
