What makes you think you only have 1003 bytes?  If UMB_POLICY_SIZE is defined as
2346, then user space must have written that amount.  Probably the problem is
that you used strcpy() to copy the data from lbuf to policy, and there is a null
character after 1003 bytes.  It is an unnecessary extra step to allocate two
buffers (lbuf & policy) and copy data from one to the other.  Why not just pass
lbuff to umb_parse_proc()??
