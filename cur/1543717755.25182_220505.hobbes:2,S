I can only say the way I read the numbers, the new hashing scores higher
ms/iteration which is a bad thing. So when it is stated that
'performance is brought down' I completely agree that it describes the
situation, performance is worse than before.
First table shows 2.6.6 (with old hash) doing better than 2.6.6-BK with
new hash. It then shows 2.6.6-Bk with old hash doing worse than 2.6.6
still, so it's not just the hash that has slowed things down.
2.6.6-new_hash does worse than 2.6.6-stock.
