Subject: [Patch 2.4.21-pre7] Old hard disk (MFM/RLL/IDE) driver not build.

Hi.
I applied Stephane Ouellette's patch on my linux 2.4.21-pre7. Now, the
kernel builds.
But, there's a problem with the IDE support (problem also present in
2.4.21-pre6, but not in 2.4.20).
I configure the kernel to use the "Old hard disk (MFM/RLL/IDE)" driver:
#
# IDE, ATA and ATAPI Block devices
#
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_ONLY=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD=y
...
drivers/ide/Makefile does not compile the drivers/ide/legacy/ subdir and
generates an empty idedriver.o because CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE is not set.
Setting this option would result in a driver not compatible with my old
hardware.
The following patch fixes the problem, but is it ok ?
