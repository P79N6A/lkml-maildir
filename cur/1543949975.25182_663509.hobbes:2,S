All right. I just tried the following:
git checkout 82bc03fc158e28c90d7ed9919410776039cb4e14
make clean && make -j3 && sudo make install modules_install
And the resulting kernel works OK. However if I checkout commit
6c3866558213ff706d8331053386915371ad63ec, and compile it using the
previous commandline, s2ram fails so it seems you're right.

If I boot with noexec=off, s2ram starts working again.
