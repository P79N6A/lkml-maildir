No need for that.  If a page is mlocked, it shouldn't be on any
of the LRU lists (since it can't be swapped out yadda yadda).
That means the locked count can share space in the struct page
with the list head used for the lru.
The only reason I haven't done this yet is that I didn't get
around to it...
