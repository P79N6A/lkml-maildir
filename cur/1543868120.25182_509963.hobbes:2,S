No it is accessing system memory by DMA to transfer frames.  Since the
system has 128MB ram, the addresses are probably all in the first 128MB
range.
I tried changing cyrix.c to explicitly set the serialize bit (0x8000 in
PCR0) rather than explcitly clearing it as is done now.  Didn't make a
difference.  I tried reversing the memory bypass setting, which also did
nothing.  Enabling CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE and recompiling however does make
a difference.

I did:
	depends on ((MWINCHIP3D || MWINCHIP2 || MWINCHIPC6) && MTRR) || MGEODEGX1
since I wasn't sure of the precedence in the Kconfig files.
