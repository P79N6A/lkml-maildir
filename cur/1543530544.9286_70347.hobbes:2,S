It seems NetBSD does (not first hand experience, though) (it's actually
a bragging point for some Netbsder's I know -- but that's of epsilon
significance).
close(2)'s manual page (as shipped by Debian) says that " File  system
       implementations which use techniques  as  ``write-behind''
       to  increase  performance may lead to write(2) succeeding,
       although the data has not been  written  yet.   The  error
       status  may be reported at a later write operation, but it
       is guaranteed to be reported on  closing  the  file."
Though the code (as per 2.3.51) does exactly that for file systems which
provide f_op->flush(), I was wondering whether fs which write
asynchronously were to be thought as actually doing write-behind or not.
From your, Jamie and Alan's answers, it seems it's not. Of course
there's fsync() for critical applications.
Thanks for your answers all.
