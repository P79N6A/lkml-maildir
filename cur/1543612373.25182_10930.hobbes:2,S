You should validate the files you download before trying to use them.  Check the
information at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/signature.html
for how to go about this.  
Use ftp(1) or wget(1) to do the downloads.  Do _not_ try to get the files using
any web browser, such as Netscape, because they are known to mangle files that
they don't understand.
