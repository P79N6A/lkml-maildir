The interface doesn't require the blockdevice driver to support requests
with blocks shorter than hardblocksize.

raid remaps the device and the sector of the bh and that has nothing to do
with the size of the bh or with the blocksize. raid act like as a virtual
layer and the size doesn't change during the virt to phys translation.

Because it's buggy, so here the fix against 2.3.30pre3:

When I gone to make the ll_rw_block layer bigmem capable I needed it from
the outside to make sure to avoid deadlocks due OOM. That's why I think
it's something that somebody (like the VM) may be interested about.
