I'll just say "+1", because that's what I meant.
Blame university for mathematical pickiness:
>>  Tabs are 8 characters, and thus indentations are also 8
is wrong ;-)   --
 *  Tabs _are_ 1 character (use a hex editor and see) and
 *  Tabs _are not always displayed_ as "8 characters"
    [there exists a user for which \t != 8] [not me though]
 *  Tabs _are displayed_ as _much characters as the user specifies_.
(CodingStyle could need a clarification.)
