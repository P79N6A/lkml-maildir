My questions is, hold it back from what? Having the 4k option is fine, 
it's just eliminating the current default which I think is undesirable. 
I tried 4k stack, I couldn't measure any improvement in anything (as in 
no visible speedup or saving in memory). For an embedded system, where 
space is tight and the code paths well known, sure, but I haven't been 
able to find or generate any objective improvement, other than some 
posts saying smaller is always better. Nothing slows a system down like 
a crash, even if it isn't followed by a restore from backup.
Feel free to point me at some results showing major improvement from 4k 
stacks, I'm open to data.
