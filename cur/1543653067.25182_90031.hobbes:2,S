Jeff, ok, so we could do as vendors: mark the ticket as LATER, or whatever
that doesnt make clearly stale tickets that nobody is looking appear on
the default queries.
If somebody is _so_ interested in a particular feature he/she can look for
tickets marked LATER, add comments and state that he/she is working on it,
provide more info, etc.
