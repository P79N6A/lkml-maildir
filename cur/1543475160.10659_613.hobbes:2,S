Probably, probably. Do not forget only, that arps are sent only
every reachable_time+delay_time seconds, and only if no another
notifications were received (from TCP). User notifications
(or even checking for time to make them) will be made every transaction.
Certainly, it can be tested by direct experiments, but now
I am inclined to believe, that the feature would be not very useful.

This item is in semi-dead state, but at least the question is formulated
in Advandced API without any explicit proposal.
Certainly, nobody prohibited us to make it first 8)

We can make it from user space, though it is not very direct.
RTM_NEWNEIGH, nud_state=NUD_REACHABLE, called for target
without NLM_F_CREATE will make this work.
ioctl() would be much more convenient (and faster), certainly.
