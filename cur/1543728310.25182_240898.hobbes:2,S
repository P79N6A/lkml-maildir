Please don't mislead newbies, Richard. /dev/console is NOT a link to
/dev/tty0, it's a completely different device:
erik@abra2:~ >ls -l /dev/console 
crw-------    1 root     tty        5,   1 Apr  7 09:13 /dev/console
erik@abra2:~ >ls -l /dev/tty0
crw-------    1 root     tty        4,   0 Feb 10  2000 /dev/tty0
On x86 desktop systems console output usually comes on the virtual
terminals, but you can also use serial console. My embedded StrongARM
board only has serial console.

And what happens when you have console on a device that's not a serial
port like a line printer?
