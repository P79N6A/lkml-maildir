Objective-C is actually a pretty minimal wrapper around C; it was  
originally implemented as a C preprocessor.  It generally does not  
have any kind of memory management, garbage collection, or anything  
else (although typically a "runtime" will provide those features).   
There are no first-class exceptions, so there would be nothing to  
worry about there (the exceptions used in GUI programs are built  
around the setjmp/longjmp primitives).  Objective-C is also almost  
completely backwards-compatible with C, much more so than C++ ever  
was.  As far as the runtime goes the kernel would be expected to  
write its own, the same way that it implements "kmalloc()" as part of  
a "C runtime".  Since the runtime itself never does any implicit  
memory allocation, I think it would conceivably even be relatively  
safe for kernel usage.
With that said, there is a significant performance penalty as all  
Objective-C method calls are looked up symbolically at runtime for  
every single call.  For GUI programs where large chunks of the code  
are event-loops and not performance-sensitive that provides a huge  
amount of extra flexibility.  In the kernel though, there are many  
codepaths where *every* *single* instruction counts; that could be a  
serious performance hit.
