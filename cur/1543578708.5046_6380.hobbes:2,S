I'm getting a keyboard lock whenever anything tries to access the PS/2 port.
This topic seems to have been discussed back in March (
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0003.2/0097.html
), but the only helpful information that came out of it was "change the IRQs in the BIOS", which my BIOS doesn't seem to be able to handle...
Kernel 2.4.0
Intel 440BX motherboard
I hope someone can help me with this, 2 button serial mice suck...
