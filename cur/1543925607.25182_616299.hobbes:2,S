Hmm... you're mentioning the quickcam module, but some of your logs are
related to usbvideo driver.
On a quick glance, I didn't find anything that could explain your
troubles. It seems to be related to a wrong order at the output format
(for example, the driver is sending RGB, instead of BGR).
It may also be an issue at the userspace application that is using the
wrong logic to deal with Big Endian.
