And my patch *MAKES* it compliant with these definitions. The scheduler 
was *NOT* compliant with these definitions.
You've quoted me out of context below. My statement that you quote 
applies to SCHED_OTHER processes.
Please see my original post with the patch. And thanks for reinforcing 
what I was saying!
