I agree, I've yet to see a single report of an actual problem that 
disabling the decode causes, nor even a theoretical problem which 
couldn't already happen due to the possibility of the device being 
accessed during BAR sizing, which just shouldn't be allowed since it 
can't work with or without this patch.
Until and unless we have something better that fixes the real and 
serious boot-time problems that we need this patch to fix, I would say 
it should stay in.
