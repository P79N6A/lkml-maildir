Subject: [PATCH][COMPAT] Eliminate the rest of the __kernel_..._t32 typedefs 0/7

Hi all,
The following patches (one for each affected architecture) remove the
last of the __kernel_..._t32 typedefs.  These patches are relative to
2.5.53 and there are now only a couple of cases where none of the
compatibility syscall infrastructure has been integrated.
