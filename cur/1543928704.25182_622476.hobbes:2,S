thanks, i've merged your 11 patches - they passed a basic build and boot 
test as well.
Roland, you've done a lot of gdb / strace / glibc development, what 
would you suggest for us to use as a ptrace regression checker? The 
problem is that ptrace is not normally used on a default bootup of a 
distro, and some of the ptrace features are really arcane. UML is an 
extensive ptrace user, so running it might be a good start, but do you 
know of any, more directed testsuite that is expected to hit all (or at 
least a substantial percentage of) the various ptrace features that we 
are affecting with these ptrace patches?
btw., your cleanup patches are having a nice effect on code quality as 
well:
                               errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC
   [before]    arch/x86/         5231          116998          44.7
   [after]     arch/x86/         5132          116656          43.9
(the 'errors' column is the sum of all .c files as per the error count 
of scripts/checkpatch.pl --file output)
it's refreshing to see life being brought back into the ptrace code 
again :-)
	Ingo
