Indeed, I counted wrong ... substracted the waitqueue when counting
the first time, then substracted it again ;)
The struct page in the current kernel is indeed 64 bytes. In
the rmap VM it's also 64 bytes (60 bytes if highmem is disabled).
After removal of the waitqueue, that'll be 52 bytes, or 48 if
highmem is disabled.
kind regards,
Rik
