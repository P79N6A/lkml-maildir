I've narrowed it down a little more.. the above does not trigger. but 
i've added some other printk's and the sequence of events goes like this:
open, mmap
SETTRIGGER : works properly with the resync_dma removed; count 
initialized to 65536
we take 6 interrupts; 4 comp + lvi + dch; count drains to 0 properly
[quake finishes initializing]
GETOPTR:
at the beginning of the call, count is 0; by the end of the call, count 
has been set to 64K
but, we take no interrupts after this point.
