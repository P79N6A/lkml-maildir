I've just switched from a G200 to G400, and I now see fbcon corruption
about once a minute (lines from another console, lines from another
console halfway between lines on the current console, ugly black and
white patters that look very wrong, lines that were previously on
other consoles, you name it I see it).

To illustrate, I had to press ^L in vim at least 10 times while composing this :-(
Are there patches somewhere? Is this solved in the 2.4.0test-? kernels? I don't know
if I should hope for that, as my isdn-compression is still broken in the 2.4.0 series....
