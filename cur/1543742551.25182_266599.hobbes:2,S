ok, this shows jackd getting preempted by a higher-prio task. This could
be the watchdog thread - could you chrt the watchdog thread to make sure
jackd itself never gets (legitimately) preempted by any other thread?
also, in my tree i fixed this codepath to not trigger an atomicity
warning, since this is an involuntary rescheduling event.

this too i'd consider a false positive, because this particular printout
happened due to a mutex, and a mutex blockage we can consider
involuntary blockage. But ... tty writes can cause BKL locking.

i'd suggest to do an atomic_off() whenever jackd prints an xrun warning 
from the highprio thread.

that would be the better longterm solution.
