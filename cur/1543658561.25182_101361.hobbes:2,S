What other ways ? Dave M reasonably argued it wasn't part of the
architecture's ABI, so did not have a place in the headers.

Eww.

It's not silly, it's a necessity on architectures like pa-risc, sparc64,
ppc64, etc. where pointers are 32 bit in userspace. OProfile simply
cannot work at all on such systems without being able to figure out the
units of the oprofile kernel buffer.
We could force the oprofile kernel buffer to always be u64s but that
just eats unnecessary space and time on x86.
So, what solution do you suggest instead ?
