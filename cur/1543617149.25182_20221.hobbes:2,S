Let's separate out the rescue disk and normal boot scenarios here.
Obviously the ideal for a rescue disk is to include as much useful stuff
as physically possible and that's not something we should be concerning
ourselves with for normal boot.
For normal boot (which is what we are talking about, as all booting is
moving to initramfs), we want enough code to get to the point where we
mount root read-only (no fsck!) and that means enough to load modules and
possibly get NFS up. And whatever else that's already in the kernel simply
for boot that can be moved to userspace. Nothing else.
