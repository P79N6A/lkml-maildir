I must learn how to use some of the test tools so I can do better
testing for you guys. I see no problems in dmesg but in
/var/log/messages I spotted this:
Jan 14 11:56:54 lightning sshd[5915]: Server listening on :: port 22.
Jan 14 11:56:54 lightning sshd[5915]: error: Bind to port 22 on
0.0.0.0 failed: Address already in use.
Scanning back through /var/log/messages I don't see that in earlier kernels.
