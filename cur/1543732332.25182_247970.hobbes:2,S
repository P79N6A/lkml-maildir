No they wouldn't.  You can do symlinks with powerful queries in
userspace _today_ (as well as directories which list queries).
Making queries be up to date in real-time is still a problem, but that
has nothing to do with symlinks or directories, or where the parsers live.

This is one occasion where you're mistaken :)
There may be other reasons for parsing query strings in the kernel
(though I'm not convinced there are any), but this isn't one.
