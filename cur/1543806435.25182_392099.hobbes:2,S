Looks like Linas Vepstas doesn't have a good email address in his From: 
fields.. As a result, the logs are nasty. 
Linas - could you _please_ fix your email setup, of if your email setup is 
good, could whoever added the bogus "From: " line to the email please NOT 
DO THAT HORRIBLE THING?
Greg, if you notice things like this, can you fix them up or bounce them 
back to the author? Yeah, I let mistakes get through too, so I shouldn't 
throw stones, but it's just so much _nicer_ if things look nice in the 
logs etc, so I try to catch it when I can..
