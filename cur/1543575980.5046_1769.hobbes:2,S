Please correct me if *I* am wrong, but shouldn't the names be
different if the values are different?
Also, excuse me while I soap-box for a moment:  This and other
inconsistencies
would be easier to deal with if there were a single repository for PCI
information from which all the PCI device tables and ID enumerations
were derived.  I have posted the technology that can easily be adapted
to emit both 2.2 and 2.4 flavors of tables, though only PCI-IDE stuff
for 2.4 is currently implemented.
  See  
ftp://autogen.linuxave.net/pub/PCIDEV.tgz
Tiny drawback:  you must download and use this to generate
all the output tables:
