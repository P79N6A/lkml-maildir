yeah, i'd support the removal of it too, if the transition is smooth and 
the regressions are resolved. And it should be smooth, as long as users 
are able to load the firmware blob, right? There's also an entry for it 
in Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt:
  What:   bcm43xx wireless network driver
  When:   2.6.26
  Files:  drivers/net/wireless/bcm43xx
  Why:    This driver's functionality has been replaced by the
          mac80211-based b43 and b43legacy drivers.
