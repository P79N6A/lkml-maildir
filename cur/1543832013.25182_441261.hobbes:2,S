The PID concept had me confused for a while and I'm still not sure it 
really applies, but there are similarities and what I want to do is not 
that different from yours (limiting then the effect of the current error) 
with the biggest difference that I keep everything in the big adjust 
function, so the extra work is only done when needed.

Here we actually don't derive very much, we already know how it will 
change. :)
We basically want to keep the difference between tick length and xtime 
interval as small as possible. Since most of the difference comes via 
second_overflow(), we might want to do some precalculations near there, so 
we avoid accumulating a lot of error in the first place, this is 
especially important with only rare updates.

The limitation avoids the biggest problems, but it also may slow down the 
error reduction (the more the bigger the shift value is). The main problem 
is really that we don't know how many ticks will be skipped and with 
interval_cycs you only know what happened last and this won't help if 
ticks are skipped in irregular intervals.
Regarding dynticks it would help a lot here to know how many ticks are 
skipped so you can spread the error correction evenly over this period 
until the next adjustment and the correction is stopped in time.
bye, Roman
