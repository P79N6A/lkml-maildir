Is everyone completely sure that there aren't bugs lurking in any of the
2.2 sound code? I know that I've had problems with both 2.2.2's and
2.2.3's sound drivers, both as modules and built in, completely locking
the system when trying to load after a warm boot. I don't plan on
remembering to shut my machine down when I reboot before I want to use
sound. Are there any bugs in 2.2.3's sound, OPL, or Soundblaster (16)
support? If it's not my problem, what are some other sound drivers I could
use instead?
