That's in the pm-timer-allow-early-access.patch:
Subject: pmtimer: Allow early access to pm timer
+static inline u32 acpi_pm_read_early(void)
+{
+       if (!pmtmr_ioport)
+               return 0;
+       /* mask the output to 24 bits */
+       return acpi_pm_read_verified();
+}
If pmtmr is not available, the function returns 0, so the resulting
delta is 0 and therefor ignored. Same applies, when PMTIMER is disabled
in the config.
