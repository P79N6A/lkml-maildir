You could check the C99 spec of course, which says gives (eg) strcmp as:
               int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);
rmk's rules of char:
1. use char for character strings and individual characters
2. use signed char if your data type relies upon negative char values
3. use unsigned char if your data type does not require negative char
   values, especially if it makes use of the positive values not
   present in the signed char range.
IOW, use signed/unsigned when you need to explicitly state your
requirements, but omit it for true strings and characters.
