  Sure, removing that would break a lot of cracker software. Oh wait,
maybe that's a good thing...
  For legitimate use, if any, a compile-time optional system call could be
added requiring a capability to use, and programs which are currently
doing that (AFS?) can be converted to use another f/s interface. I have
seen a few mentions of software which DO use that capability, I'm not sure
I've seen one which can be done no other way.
