Wouldn't it be nice to be able to specify upon loading, or during runtime
to modules whether debug messages should be printed?
- No kernel recompile needed for debugging.
- Less *_DEBUG options required in menuconfig.
How I think this could work:
Add to the module struct a bool to denote debugging state. If set, pr_debug
forwards messages to printk.
Another advantage:
- A module could be loaded after an unexpected conditions (e.g. after a BUG_ON).
Caveats I can see right now:
- For modules often loaded during boot this may not be a good solution.
Alternatively, instead of a bool for the debug state, the module struct could
also get a log-level flag: messages below that level won't be printed.
