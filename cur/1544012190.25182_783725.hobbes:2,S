What might help a lot of people (me, for one) would be a cookbook listing
how to do things that those of us on the fringe might want to do. For example:
"type this to pull Linus's tree, and this to bisect it" (I already know how
to do this one, actually)
"type this to pull a linux-next tree, and this to bisect it" (Last time I tried,
the pull went OK, but I couldn't figure out how to give 'git bisect' a
start/end commit that it was happy with).
"'git log foo/bar/baz.c' is your friend if you're chasing a recently added
bug/regression in baz.c"
Hmm... it occurs to me that my only actual use for git is to find a commit
ID so when I whinge to a developer, we're on the same page... ;)
