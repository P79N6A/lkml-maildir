Hi,
   2.2.x has for the most part been rock stable for me, however there is
one persisting problem which really still seems to lock it up for me.
Whenever a large memory allocation occurs, the system seems to just lock
up during that period and become completely unresponsive. Just a few
minutes ago, I had a program which basically went intoa  while (1) {
mallloc(1024) } loop. At the time of this, I had about 150 megs of ram
free (between swap and physical) and still, the system became completely
unresponsive and I had to hit the power button.  The last refresh of
wmmon showed abuot 50% of the swap free. So its not like there was no
ram left. Also, whats wierder is, ip masquerading still worked without a
hitch, so I'm not sure exactly what is going on.
The system is a Celeron 333a with 96 megs of physical ram and 256 megs
of swap.
