-HI All,
-I am not able to recieve messages using sock_recvmsg()
-Server running on TCP port in kernel space and client is in  user space.
Client is sending the messages and server recieving them and no error
observed while recieving.
But i couldn't able to get the messages
This is the code i am using
 msg.msg_name = NULL;
msg.msg_namelen = 0;
msg.msg_iov = &iov;
msg.msg_iovlen = 1;
msg.msg_control = NULL;
msg.msg_controllen = 0;
msg.msg_flags = 0
len = 0
 len = sock_recvmsg(newsock, &msg, (size_t)buf, 0)
printk( KERN_ALERT "recieved message is %s",buf)
But not printing the content of buffer.
Any help in this regard is highly appreciated
Thanks
Bhaskar
