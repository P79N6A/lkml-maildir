You can ask Kbuild why its building with make V=2.
make V=2 -C ~/src/linux-git O=$HOME/build/linux-2.6.20
from scripts/Kbuild.include:
###
# why - tell why a a target got build
#       enabled by make V=2
#       Output (listed in the order they are checked):
#          (1) - due to target is PHONY
#          (2) - due to target missing
#          (3) - due to: file1.h file2.h
#          (4) - due to command line change
#          (5) - due to missing .cmd file
#          (6) - due to target not in $(targets)
# (1) PHONY targets are always build
# (2) No target, so we better build it
# (3) Prerequisite is newer than target
# (4) The command line stored in the file named dir/.target.cmd
#     differed from actual command line. This happens when compiler
#     options changes
# (5) No dir/.target.cmd file (used to store command line)
# (6) No dir/.target.cmd file and target not listed in $(targets)
#     This is a good hint that there is a bug in the kbuild file
