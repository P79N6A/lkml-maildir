It is done only for !CPU_IDLE case to take care of regression at hand.
CPU_IDLE case technically is not a regression as it is a new config
option. It is not easy to implement this with CPU_IDLE as acpi driver
only provides the C-state mechanism and does not have the policy in it
anymore with CPU_IDLE. It still can be done with some hacky code. But, I
am incliced to switch this to using latency interface which is more
cleaner than max_cstate interface.
For example, max_cstate does not mean anything to the user, as BIOSes
normally tend to hide one C-state or more than one C-states behind one
OS visible C-state. Like C2 mapped to real C3 etc. Saying that I don't
want CPUs to enter any C-state more than 100uS latency is cleaner in
comparison (even though we depend on the latency number coming from the
BIOS).
Mark said this latency interface is not working as it is expected to at
this moment. I will look at that soon and then we will have an alternate
mechanism for this limiting C-state thing.
I am OK with the below changelog.
Thanks,
Venki
