Tested on:
ABIT KV7 VIAKT600 chipset
Kernel 2.6.5-rc1
With no options:
libata version 1.01 loaded.
sata_via version 0.20
sata_via(0000:00:0f.0): routed to hard irq line 11
ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xB400 ctl 0xB802 bmdma 0xC400 irq 10
ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xBC00 ctl 0xC002 bmdma 0xC408 irq 10
ata1 is slow to respond, please be patient
ata1 failed to respond (30 secs)
ata1: thread exiting
scsi0 : sata_via
ata2: no device found (phy stat 00000000)
ata2: thread exiting
scsi1 : sata_via
With:
1. acpi=off
2. noapic
3. acpi=off noapic
4. acpi=off noapic iommu=off
Result is always the same:
libata version 1.01 loaded.
sata_via version 0.20
sata_via(0000:00:0f.0): routed to hard irq line 11
ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xB400 ctl 0xB802 bmdma 0xC400 irq 11
ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xBC00 ctl 0xC002 bmdma 0xC408 irq 11
ata1 is slow to respond, please be patient

This is the same behavior I get ever since 2.6.1 when I started testing 2.6 
seried. It also doesn't work under 2.6 with IDE generic support for 
VIA8237SATA (irq timeout, dma timeout)
I works fine with VIA8237SATA generic patch under 2.4.25 though...
