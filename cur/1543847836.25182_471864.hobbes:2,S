	The sed(1) is trivial sure.  seq_file isn't terribly complex.
It's less about mere code knowledge and more about intention.  Really,
it's how people understand configfs will deal with their attributes.

	If I see a seq_file, I assume there are multiple things to
iterate over.  Don't you?

	It could be today, without much trouble.  The entire point is to
prevent client modules from implementing a filesystem or any filesystem
semantics.  They implement an item hierarchy with attributes.  The
attributes are read-write with ->show() and ->set().  The filesystem
should be invisible to the client.

	I don't want some set of ad-hoc rules based on legacy broken
ideas.  "Well, you can do this, or this, or this, or even this, and all
sort of work, but it's a mess" is not a good thing.
