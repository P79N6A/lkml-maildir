Well the problem with a lot of ATI chips is they can be put onto
either an AGP or PCI card and work fine, so chips which are AGP chips
can end up on PCI cards...
I've cc'ed Jon Smirl who has a similiar setup (or has at least an AGP
and PCI radeon on his machine).... Jon can you try 2.6.10 on your
setup and see does it work?
it sounds like something may have broken the int10 stuff, but I've no
idea what, the only other thing I can think to recommend doing is an
binary search say starting at 2.6.9-rc1 and maybe using the -bk
snapshots to nail down exactly when it went wrong....
Dave.
