   Does cache line bounce (shared somewhere -> exclusive elsewhere) cost
   more that a simple miss (present nowhere -> exclusive somewhere) ?
They are about equal.  For coherency purposes all cpus have to listen
to all the transactions anyways to see if they have a match in their
L2 caches (and thus must provide the data to the requestor).
Perhaps the exclusive somewhere --> exclusive somewhere else is a bit
more expensive because you eat a write port for the cache line move on
the processor providing the data.
