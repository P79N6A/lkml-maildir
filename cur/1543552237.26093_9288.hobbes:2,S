Hmmm I don't think so.  From the dmesg of my K6-2+ [a 500Mhz underclocked
to 75Mhzx6 on my poor PA-2007 motherboard]
CPU: L1 I Cache: 32K  L1 D Cache: 32K (32 bytes/line)
CPU: L2 Cache: 128K
CPU: AMD-K6(tm)-III Processor stepping 04
Features of the K6-2+ are the L2-cache, the smaller mask size, the
Power-Now stuff, and some Athlon 3dnow extensions.
And to whoever doubted my list of K6 model names, believe me, I have
accounts on machines with K6, K6-2, K6-III, and K6-2+, so I have much
experience trying to get sane CPU types from AMD's lousy model field.
