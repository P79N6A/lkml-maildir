I thought maybe creating some struct kobject by hand for every LUN.
This is undesirable mainly because I do not trust myself with handling
struct kobject at all (currently I only use block device API and so I
blame Jens every time there's a problem :-)). But if Jeremy cannot
work around it, I would have to think about it - maybe as a Fedora-specific
patch.
