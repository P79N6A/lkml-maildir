No, in that case (in which there was a failure to write to the DMA TX
buffers), I'll discard that packet and restart the queue.
The thing is, as pointed out by Andi Kleen <ak@muc.de>, that I wans't
doing netif_stop_queue when the packet was successfully sent to the
hardware. Now everything is correct.
Anyhow, thanks for your answer!

Ivan
