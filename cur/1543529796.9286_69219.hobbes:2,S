I am having a strange issue with the tulip_cb driver under 2.3.51. I
suspect that it is a problem with the tulip_cb driver 'cause my ray_cs
driver/card combo function as they should.
The problem is that the stab file is wrong. Here is the
/var/state/pcmcia/stab file from 2.3.51:
Socket 0: empty
Socket 1: UMAX Technologies UMAX250 Fast Ethernet
1	network	tulip_cb	0	tulip_cb
From 2.2.14 I get:
Socket 0: empty
Socket 1: UMAX Technologies UMAX250 Fast Ethernet
1	network	tulip_cb	0	eth0
This causes cardmgr to try and run "./network start tulip_cb" not
"./network start eth0" as it should.
Erik.
