it could be done, but i dont think we should do it. It makes RT
scheduling much more of a special-case. Right now RT scheduling is 99%
like normal scheduling - with the difference that RT priorities are
"higher" than the normal priorities and that each RT priority level is
"exclusive": the scheduler will let such tasks run until they want,
without applying fairness policies.
by making RT tasks more of a special case we'd destabilize the whole
thing: there would be kernel preemptability bugs that only RT tasks
would hit - resulting in a steady deterioration of PREEMPT support in
the kernel. (the ratio of RT tasks is perhaps 0.1% of all use, or less.) 
So applying _any_ RT-only technique besides the bare minimum is asking
for trouble in the long run.
furthermore, we had hard-to-trigger SMP bugs that the PREEMPT kernel
triggered much faster - resulting in an indirect stabilization of our
SMP code. If nothing else then this alone makes PREEMPT very useful.
