Then you replace errors with inefficiency - nobody discovers that
you needlessly take a lock twice.  They notice OOPSes though, the
lock gurus can then debug it.
Trading performance for simplicity is ok in some cases, but I have a strong
felling this isn't one of them.  Consider how people optimize locking
by shaving off a single cycle when they can, and try to avoid
locking as much as possible for that big smp scalability.
This is something better done right - people should just take the
trouble.
