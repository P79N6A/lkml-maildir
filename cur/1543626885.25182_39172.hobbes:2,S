Where the symbol's content is placed is irrelevant.  System.map
contains the symbol _name_, not its _contents_.  But symbol names
cannot contain the special characters that people put in extraversion.
Even mapping the special characters to '_' will not help because a lot
of people do not change extraversion when changing config and the
change of config can really move symbols around.  Hence all the checks
that ksymoops does to validate symbol addresses between multiple
sources.
I have some ideas about making System.map and the kernel record which
build they refer to, including the .config data.  But that is 2.5
material, after kbuild 2.5 goes in.
