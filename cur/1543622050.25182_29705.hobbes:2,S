Thanks, Ingo.
Could you, or some other kind soul who understands this, to
explain why the following alternative for migrating proceses
currently running on some other cpu wouldn't have been better
(simpler and sufficient):
    - add another variable to the task_struct, say "eviction_notice"
    - when it comes time to tell a process to migrate, set this
	eviction_notice (and then continue without waiting)
    - rely on code that fires each time slice on the cpu currently
        hosting the evicted process to notice the eviction notice and
	serve it (migrate the process instead of giving it yet another
	slice).
