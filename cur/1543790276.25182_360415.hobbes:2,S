Interesting.  The second device here is probably a SMC FDC37N971?  I
remember there used to be some hacks around because it was relocated
from the default 0x3f0 or 0x370 to 0xe0.  This affected the smc-ircc
driver among other things.  See for example
http://www.lrr.in.tum.de/~acher/m300/
(This was on a M300, but I guess the M700 has the same problem)
Unfortunately both of the M300s I have around here are now stone dead,
so I can't test the patch.
