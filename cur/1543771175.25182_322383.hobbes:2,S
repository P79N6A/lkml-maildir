I'm not an audiophile, I can't tell the difference between a mp3 encoded at
128k and one encoded at 160k so I really doubt I could tell the difference
between what cdda2wav and what most other DAE programs would produce. So
given that the quality of the rips will be effectively equal to my ears,
I'll use whatever's most convenient.
