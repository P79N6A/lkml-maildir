Hi,
On my Gateway Solo 2100 with a 2.2.0-pre6 kernel and
CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF=y the machine doesn't power down after shutdown.
The rest of APM appears to function normally.  The last two lines
displayed on the console are:
The system is halted
System halted.
This used to work with the 2.0 kernels.  Thanks for looking into this.
