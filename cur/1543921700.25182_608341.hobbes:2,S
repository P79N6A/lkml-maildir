Will integrated sensors on DG965 motherboard be supported?
They can be accessed only through the
HECI interface, but the board has no AMT, and even if it had one, I don't 
think AMT includes HW sensors.
Will it be supported?
I really need it (I have to reboot to bios each time to see the sensors, which is
both inaccurate, and annoying)
