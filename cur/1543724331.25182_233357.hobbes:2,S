Well gcc is not terribly hackable that way, something about decades
of code bloat...
The thing to keep in mind is that it was the integer to pointer
conversion that needed to be hacked.  (void *)0 is the null pointer
constant by definition.  So you it is technically illegal in that
context to use (ptr *)0 to refer to the first page of memory.  It
must be another number that you can convert and manipulate.
For a single program I do agree that it probably would not be worth it
but if you were delivering an architecture where people wrote lots
of code it would be better fix the compiler to be standards conforming.
