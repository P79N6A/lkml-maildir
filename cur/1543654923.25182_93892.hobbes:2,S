Not quite.  Well, I guess you can modify all of your drivers to do this,
but see below for an easier way.

Why not have a call in the driver that notifies the bus specific core of
this?  Or just check the status of the return value of your "probe"
function that the bus provides.  See usb_device_probe() and
pci_device_probe() for examples of this.
