I have the same problems with an ALS007 card (in a 486 system).
The card is correctly recognized and set up by the PnP drivers.
The system freezes completely when using sound (no ping replies
anymore), and it's not a CPU/motherboard/RAM issue
(it compiles kernels without any problems), it occurs while
playing MP3's, while playing LxDoom ( now i have an excuse
to play Doom, testing the Linux sound drivers ;) ).
The time after which it crashes is variable, sometimes it crashes
immediately, sometimes it crashes after 5 minutes.
Sometimes, it also stalls a few times before finally crashing.
Having persistant DMA buffers enabled/disabled doesn't change
anything (the machine has 16MB of RAM), and the problem occurs
both when using modules or compiled-in drivers.
Both 2.4.8 and 2.4.9 have this problem (these are the ones I tried).
Btw on 2.2.x i get DMA (output) timeout errors (and broken sound).
There is also another "issue":
the ISAPnP code calls "CMI8330 quirk".  As i have no such
card, i thought this was related to the problem.  After
commenting it out in quirks.c and recompiling, the quirk
was not called anymore, but it didn't solve the problem.
