Yeah, I wasn't so much interrested in the firmware just yet, just interrested if the device driver
(dpt_i2o) gave it a fighting chance of doing the right thing.

That's what I read in the comments too, but looking at the code I only ever see it set to
write-back.  I verified this with blktool - our controllers have no battery, and blktool showed
the i2o-wcache state as write-back.
However, I was also told that the i2o_block driver lacks barrier support, so even in the
write-back case, the controller won't be told to flush/sync.
I was sent a patch against 2.6.10 that implements barrier support in i2o_block, but the code base
has shifted too much for me to make it apply.
