Thanks for the explanation Paul, now the code actually makes sense.  
Converting to the DMA mapping API doesn't make sense at all in this context 
then, since we're basically programming the GATT (an IOMMU type table) with 
physical addresses.  Ken, are you sure you need to make these changes at all?  
Does Xen break w/o them?
