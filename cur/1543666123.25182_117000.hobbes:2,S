This looks like a bug.  It should be safe to delete them.  Rationale:
 - Documentation/filesystems/Locking says ->truncate is called without the BKL.
 - This isn't the only place vmtruncate() is called.  Several of the callers
   do it without the BKL (eg xfs, cifs).
 - vmtruncate() appears to handle its own locking (mapping->i_shared_sem)
