"uname -a" will show SMP status.
euler(jk)$ uname -a
Linux euler.axel.nom 2.4.4-pre5 #1 SMP Thu Apr 19 19:20:40 EDT 2001 i686 unknown
this is on a redhat system, but i think it will work on any linux
system.

it's probably easiest to download the latest kernel (2.4.3 at the time
of this writing) from ftp.XX.kernel.org (XX being your country code).
then configure using "make xconfig" or "make menuconfig".  choose SMP
in one of the first menus.  there's a kernel-howto which explains this
stuff.  btw there is no problem running your own kernels on a redhat
system bypassing rpm.
in a source tree in which you've compiled SMP and want UP or
vice-versa, i think to do a "make distclean" in between switching.
