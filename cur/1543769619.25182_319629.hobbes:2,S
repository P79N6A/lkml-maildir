Hello,
I have a question about ways of accessing a file. 
I know it is possible to use: fseek + fwrite/fread to access a file.
and It is also possible to map file in memory with  "mmap" function,
and access it by adressing memory.
Currently I use the frame buffer of  mobile phones with mmap function.
For my understanding, I would like to know what is the difference
between using fseek+fwrite compared to mmap style.
Dont hesitate to be precise or to use technical terms.
Thanks you,
Sylvanino
