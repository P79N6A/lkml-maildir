If you pass mem= you have to pass mem=3840M.  Yes, it sucks, but if you
genuinely have a machine which is so fucked up that you can't rely on
the memory map the BIOS presents to you, you have problems to begin with.
Oh yes, this is why GRUB passing the mem= parameter gratuitously was
beyond total and complete brainfuckage.
