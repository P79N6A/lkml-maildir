Such a system needs a drastically different bootup process than 
currently
exists, including the ability to specify init-script dependencies.  
(Like
for example user login via GDM (and with our setup, GDM working at all)
requires that AFS is mounted and NIS is working, which both require the
network to be available, which requires...  You can see where this is
going.  I think eventually we need a better /sbin/init, one that can use
a traditional legacy /etc/inittab file in addition to a newfangled
simultaneous boot process with lots of ways to start various kinds of
services.  Unfortunately such a system will need a _LOT_ of work and
testing to make sure it doesn't break existing setups.  Oh well, I can
dream, can't I? :-D
