This is a good idea, but do you really want to punt just becouse someone
goofed on the permissions of the file? This could cause
hard-to-diagnose changes in behavior if there are any bugs ot
inconsistancy between the khttpd and userspace httpd, and from a security
point of view, the worst that would happen is that your cgi would be
downloaded rather then executed (messy, but is it really that much of a
security risk?)
