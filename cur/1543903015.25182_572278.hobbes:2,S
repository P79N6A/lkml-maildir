Ignore what?  /sys/block?  If you see /sys/class/block, then yes, you
can ignore it as they are just symlinks back to each other.

No, the /sys/class/block is in -mm and has been for some time.

Not true at all, it works just fine here on my machines, and on all
distros released in the past year or so as tested out by a lot of users.
The only reason it isn't in Linus's tree just yet, is that some very old
mkinitrd programs don't seem to like it (we are talking Fedora Core 3
based distros, not Fedora itself.)  People are trying to work out what
the proper fix is for userspace there when they get the time.
So, expect the change to show up in 2.6.24.

What?  Since when does udev have to be in the kernel source tarball?
Who ever said that?
The issue here is that if you follow the rules as specified by the file,
Documentation/sysfs-rules.txt and Documentation/ABI/*/sysfs-* you should
be just fine.  To ignore them, as you have done in your examples, will
cause problems.

The issue is that the devices themselves keep moving around in the sysfs
tree all the time as systems are dynamic and change.
Again, look at the udevtrigger program for a simple way to achieve this
/dev population that you so desire.
But also realize that sysfs is much bigger than just trying to get the
information to create a /dev tree.

Here's the rule:
	If the SUBSYSTEM is "block", it's a block device.  Otherwise
	it's a char device.
But also realize that the majority of events you will get have nothing
to do with device nodes.  I think you are forgetting this fact.

It's not a "breakage", we are preserving a symlink.  The point is that
you should not rely on the fact that /sys/block will be there in the
future, as the documentation I pointed to above describes.

That was the problem right there.  Why would you ever want to traverse
symlinks blindly without realizing what you were walking?  You can't
just run 'find' on sysfs and expect to not get caught in endless loops,
as the goal of the different parts of sysfs is to be able to start in
one place, and figure out all of the needed information from there.
For example, if you have a device, you can get the subsystem it belongs
to, the driver bound to it, and other stuff.  If you start with a
driver, you can get the devices it binds.  Can you see the circle
already?
So, you need to watch what you are trying to find, and if you do that,
you never will get caught in circles.  We never had that problem in udev
at all, as we just work with what was passed to us, not blindly try to
walk the whole sysfs tree.
Please use the proper context in order to get the information you need.
And at all times, a directory can turn into a symlink in order to keep
the same information possible.

You could not build it?  Why not?  Did you send me a patch for this
problem that was major enough to keep you from using the project?

Not at all, we are saying to look at how to achive what you are trying
to achieve by reading a very small and well documented .c file (530
lines with comments) that explains how to easily and quickly achieve
what you are trying to duplicate.
Heck, I did the same thing in a bash script for the Gentoo startup code
a while back that still works, but has ordering issues that the .c file
fixes up.  Hence it was dropped for the replacement that we are pointing
you at.

Hence the Documenation/CHANGES file documents the version that is
needed.  Right now it shows a version that is over a year and a half
old.  I do know that you can get away with running versions that are
even older than that if you want to, but it's not really recommended.

The development cycle of udev has nothing to do with sysfs here.  Other
than the fact that we learned how to interact with a kernel interface
that directly exposes the internals of the kernel itself, something that
no one had done before.  In learning how to handle such major changes,
udev has changed in order to support zillions of devices, small memory
footprints, and lightening fast speed, all changes that required big
udev internal changes, but had _nothing_ to do with the kernel and/or
sysfs.

If you want to figure out how to create a dynamic /dev filesystem that
can handle persistance device names, dynamic rules created by users,
zillions of devices on small and big systems, small footprint, and very
quick speed, then yes, read the udev source code.
What is the goal of this document here?  You start out trying to explain
the hotplug interface, and then get side tracked into talking about
creating a dynamic /dev/ filesystem in userspace and then ramble on into
how sysfs is layed out.  These are three separate things
While the act of creating such a /dev filesystem does have something to
do with the hotplug/uevent interface of the kernel, it isn't reliant on
it.  And the layout of sysfs also doesn't really have much affect on the
creation of such a /dev filesystem, as udev proves (it works just fine
without sysfs even being mounted.)
If you want to just document the hotplug/uevent interface then do
that.
If you want to document sysfs and it's structure, do that too, after
reading the existing documentation and understanding that.
