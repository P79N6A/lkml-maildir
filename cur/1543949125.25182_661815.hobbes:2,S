I'm still not sure if this particular race would happen if only the registering

Why would it?  It's not taken recursively at any place.
In fact we can't take dev->power.lock under dpm_list_mtx, because that would
deadlock (we have to be able to take dpm_list_mtx to complete the suspending
of devices).  For this reason, dpm_list_mtx is taken under dev->power.lock.
However, we don't know which lock to acquire (dev is unknown) until we get the
next device to suspend.  Thus, I first get the device (under dpm_list_mtx) and
release dpm_list_mtx.  Next, I take dev->power.lock and dpm_list_mtx under it
and check if the selected device is still the last on the list.  If it's not,
something has been registered in the meantime and it's better to get the new
device to suspend first (this seems to be cleaner than resuming an already
suspended device).
I could release dev->power.lock as soon as suspend_device(dev, state) has run,
but that could result in new devices being added to dpm_active in a wrong
order, so it's better not to release it until resume_device(dev).  However,
it's probably is safe to release it right prior to running resume_device(dev)
(after we've added dev back to dpm_active), because in that case the ordering
will be fine.

It may oops, though, if a driver attempts to use a device that it failed to
register, but didn't check.

No, I don't, but that's really along the lines of the last patch.

Well, people want to remove the freezing of tasks altogether from the suspend
code path.  Do you think it's not doable in the long run?

In fact, that's the matter of how we are going to handle the runtime PM vs
the system-wide suspend.

Yes, I am.  In fact I have a patch for that I'm going to send in a while. :-)

I wonder how that would be different from using dev->power.lock for blocking
the registration of new children.  The only practical difference I see is that
the driver will have to block the registrations, this way or another, instead
of the core.
