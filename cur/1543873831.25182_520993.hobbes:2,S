OK.

There are a bunch of freezer fixes in -mm.  But problems might still remain
- I don't think freezer has had a lot of load put on it yet, but it will
soon and it needs to become reliable.

Yes, using the freezer and module load/unload time seems like a good idea.

yup.

Yes, freezer needs to be decoupled from swsusp and from power management
and it should become a first-class core kernel component.  Whether we would
need a CONFIG_FREEZER isn't clear - I suspect we'd end up just compiling it
unconditionally.
I cc'ed Rafael, who is doing the freezer revamp work.
