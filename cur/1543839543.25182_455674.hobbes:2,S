Perhaps stupid suggestion:
Should there be new signal for 'failure to drop privileges' ?
( perhaps SIGPRIV or is this name free )
By default signal terminates process.  
By setting this to SIG_IGN this allows deamons handle situation when 
becoming to user failed and give proper error message.
Still unaware root processes are killed and not causing privilge escalation.
