Instead of masking the hash value down to 11 bits you could try:
index = (hash ^ (hash >> 11) ^ (hash >> 22)) & 0x7ff;
I ran a quick test which gave fairly good results with that: 12871
identifiers
from a source tree) gave a mean square bucket size of 45.65, expected
value for a random function is 45.78.
That change might improve some of your other hashes as well - there
doesn't
seem to be much point in computing a 32 bit value only to throw 20 bits
away -
stirring in the extra bits makes much more sense to me.

I didn't say it was.  "almost irreducible" polynomials with Hamming
weight two are pretty rare...  Relative to say, x**32 - 1 or x**24 - 1,
having 7 factors is good.
