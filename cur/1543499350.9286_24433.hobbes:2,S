Not in 2.[123].x.  CONFIG_SERIAL_ECHO is long gone and there is no need
to hack the code any more.  Under config for char devices, select
"Standard/generic (dumb) serial support" and "Support for console on
serial port".  I have only used it with serial support builtin, I have
no idea if it works with serial as a module.  In lilo or other boot
loader, pass the console parameter to set com port, speed etc.  Mine
looks like this.
