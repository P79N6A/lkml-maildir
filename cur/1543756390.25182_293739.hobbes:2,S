If the kernel development was linear, it could be enough.
But with the branch'n'merge nature of BK it is hard if not impossible
to extract enough data from those patches (I looked at the history
of the last 2 months and I had several patch conflits due to a
changeset being included on several branches which were merged later,
several mails whose date was not the same as the changeset[*]).
What you could make available in the bkcvs export would be, for each
changeset (both for the changesets and for the merged changesets),
include three BKRevs:  the changeset's one, the changeset's parent one,
and the changeset's merge parent one. 
That information could be used to reconstruct the entire tree,
using either bk-commit-head (preferred) or bkbits, provided you
put the BKRev: tag into the bk-commit-head posts too.
Technicaly speaking this should be very easy for you to implement.
What do you think ?
Stelian.

ChangeSet 1.2030, 2005/02/02 13:52:52-08:00, torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org
	Merge bk://drm.bkbits.net/drm-linus
	into ppc970.osdl.org:/home/torvalds/v2.6/linux
is translated in CVS into:
