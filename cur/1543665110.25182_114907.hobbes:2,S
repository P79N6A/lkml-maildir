We set the mapping to 255, 63, .. whe the drive supports reporting its
LBA geometry addressing. Otherwise we use the lba capacity based on 
the bios mapping. The 48bit LBA factor would explain the reason you
saw some drives work and some fail.

Linux maps the disk in a logical block order at all times. The partition
code looks for any existing mappings and then translates based on the
data it discovers (fs/partition/msdos.c calling ide_xlate_1024()

I don't think thats viable when doing 48bit LBA.

You'd have to ask Andre to be sure but I believe it is what the spec
says about those mappings. The more interesting question if thats what
you are seeing is why the ide_xlate_1024 handling isn't picking up 
on the situation. That seems to be the actual problem case.
