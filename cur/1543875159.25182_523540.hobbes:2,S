Subject: [patch 0/2] introduce /dev/hugetlb char device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Introduce /dev/hugetlb device that behaves similar to /dev/zero for
allocating anonymous hugetlb page.  It is especially beneficial that
application developers can have an easy way to create MAP_PRIVATE
hugetlb mappings without all the fuss about the hugetlbfs filesystem.
Two follow on patches has more detail description for each changeset.
