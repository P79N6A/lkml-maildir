No, the problem is that the only thing that needs to be shared are the
_ABI_ headers, which are unfortunately mixed in with kernel-internal
headers and definitions.  This leads to use of kernel-internal
definitions in userspace, which leads to breakage.  This also leads to
restrictions on changing -kernel-internal- headers, because some
userspace wanker is complaining.
Kernel-internal headers and definitions should absolutely never be used
in userspace.
H. Peter Anvin has suggested an include/abi which could be shared, and
this seem quite reasonable to me.  However, the monumental task of
separating kernel-internal definitions from ABI definitions still
remains.
	Jeff, really glad the linux-libc-headers guys started his effort
