This is the same oops I get except that for me I see it as a left over
scsi device even after sbp2 is unloaded (unload sbp2 and check
/proc/partitions). I haven't been able to figure out how to get the scsi
subsystem to remove devices in this condition:
	scsi_register_module(MODULE_SCSI_HA, &sbp2_template);
	scsi_host = scsi_register(&sbp2_template, 0);
	// (some devices get detected)
	// removal of host
	scsi_unregister(scsi_host);
	// Removal of sbp2 module to unregister template
	scsi_unregister_module(MODULE_SCSI_HA, &sbp2_template);
In actuality, doing scsi_unregister(scsi_host), in my eyes should also
deallocate the devices associated with that scsi_host. That doesn't
happen. It seems to me that the logic is that I should not call
scsi_unregister(scsi_host), since it gets called for the
scsi_unregister_module() of the template. However, that allows a
scsi_host leak for situations where ieee1394 controllers are getting
plugged/unplugged. It will continue to leak until sbp2 is unloaded.
I'm not sure if the leak is more optimal than the oops...maybe it is.
I'll revisit this in the next week.
