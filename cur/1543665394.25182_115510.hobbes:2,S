Wrong.
Now think three trees.  Each merging back and forth between each other. 
Or, in the case of something like the Linux kernel tree, where you don't
have two or three trees.  You've got at least 20 actively developed
concurrent trees with branches at different points. 
Trust me. CVS simple CANNOT do this. You need the full information.
Give it up.  BitKeeper is simply superior to CVS/SVN, and will stay that
way indefinitely since most people don't seem to even understand _why_
it is superior.
