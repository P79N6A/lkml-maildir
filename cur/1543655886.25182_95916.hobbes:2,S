PSAUX is not some fantastic French technology, it must be enabled.
My 3COM/USB adapter seems to be enabled correctly but the LCD lights do not 
blink. Still testing.
95% there, although I did hack into do_mounts and force fed the proper root 
device.
The patch for make that fixes make modules works fine, thank you.
Question:  Can I turn REISERFS on and off for testing (does in nun on top of 
EXT2)
Yast is a dog.
