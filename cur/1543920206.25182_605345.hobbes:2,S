Hi,
Your patch looks quite clean in general; however it does make me wonder
if it should either leverage or expand the arch/x86/pci/pcbios.c
infrastructure for doing BIOS32 calls and share that.... it's kinda
unpleasant as a general thought to have drivers poke this deep into
various guts of the system/bios.... esp if the common code has to do
something very similar already.
