Dave,
Looks strange, the faulting address is in the same region as the
eip. I am not that strong on x86 layouts, so I am not sure whether
0x78xxxxxx is the kernel's mapping or it's module space. Almost looks
like something else had registered a notifier and then gone away
without unregistering it.
Herbert, any chance you can make the complete boot log up to the point
where it crashes, as well as a System.map and your .config available?
(probably not posted to all the lists :)
Cheers,
Jes
