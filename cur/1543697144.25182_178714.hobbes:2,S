Well, the problem I saw was with the 2.6 patch.
These lines:
+++ build-2.6/drivers/net/forcedeth.c	2003-11-15 23:00:30.000000000 +0100
@@ -0,0 +1,1416 @@
Should be
+++ build-2.6/drivers/net/forcedeth.c	2003-11-15 23:00:30.000000000 +0100
@@ -0,0 +1,1418 @@
Otherwise, the last 2 lines:
+module_init(init_nic);
+module_exit(exit_nic);
Get cut off.
