The md layer code can already do the job fine - but it does need to get
to the point that the block layer provides better error information
upstream so it can make better decisions.
LVM2 is a nice clean remapper, so it should sit on top of the md or
other failover mappers easily enough. You can probably do failover by
updating map tables too.
Its nice clean code unlike EVMS, and doesnt duplicate half the kernel 
so its easier to hack on
