I don't want to dump the disks, but I may be ordering a 3ware controller 
in the near future. The only reason I didn't get a 3ware controller in 
the first place was that the Sil 3114 was on the motherboard.

I thought that the Seagate ST3160023AS was a fairly new drive. I noticed 
a comment that version 3.18 of the firmware may not suffer from this 
problem, can anyone confirm this? I'm going to try removing my drive 
from the blacklist and see what happens.

I tried, my contact at Seagate doesn't seem to be with them anymore (I 
haven't worked in the storage space in quite some time).
                 Thanks for the help,
