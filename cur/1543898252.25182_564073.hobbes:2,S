Included with the docs there's a list of the OSS ioctls. I don't understand 
enough of the problem to judge whether they are suitable to be handled by 
FUSE:
http://manuals.opensound.com/developer/ioctl.html
 [version 4]
http://www.4front-tech.com/pguide/oss.pdf
 [version 3]
I don't know which API version is supposed to be supported though.
