Well, why can't it be enabled by default? Other options are as well, and it's
IMHO sane to enable keyboard and mice support by default. It should clear up
the initial confusion as well.
I think that these options should be enabled by default:
[Userland interfaces]
	Mouse interface
		Legacy /dev/psaux (?)
			(I suggest to make this non-default in 2.7, but maybe
			 we want shorter transition period?)
[Input I/O drivers]
	Serial i/o support
		i8042
		Serial port line discipline
[Input device drivers]
	Keyboards
		AT keyboard support
	Mice
		Serial mouse (?)
			(..or maybe not, this is really not so common as PS/2
			 lately)
		PS/2 mouse
I think that those are absolute minimum and if anyone will want to have any of
these explicitly off, he's more likely to know where to turn it off, rather
than vice versa.
