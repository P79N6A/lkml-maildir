that would probably be the case if it's multiple sockets - but for 
multiple cores exactly the opposite is true: the sooner _both_ cores 
finish processing, the deeper power use the CPU can reach. So effective 
and immediate spreading of workloads amongst multiple cores - especially 
with shared L2 caches where the cost of migration is low, helps power 
consumption. (and it obviously helps latencies and bandwith)
