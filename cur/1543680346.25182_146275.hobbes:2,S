I don't have a record of it, but as I remember, when that happened I had 
APIC enabled in the BIOS.  After that, I switched to PIC.
In this machine's BIOS Setup BIOS FEATURES SETUP screen, there's the line:
   Interrupt Mode         : PIC
The other option is APIC.  Make sure it says PIC.
I think it was Alan Cox who pointed out that on single-processor systems 
you need to have PIC, and not APIC enabled.  And my kernel wasn't even 
built with APIC support ("# CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC is not set").
APIC is a newer interrupt controller type, PIC is the orginal 8259A 
type.  These chipsets can emulate either type in hardware.
I don't know if that's your problem, but you might check.
