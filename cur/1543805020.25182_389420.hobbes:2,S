In that case, I think we do require the current vpid_to_pid(translations)
in order to transfer the external user pid ( relative to the namespace )
into one that combines namespace (aka container_id) with the external pid.
Exactly how it is done today.
What will slightly change is the low level implementations of the
inline pid_t pid_to_vpid_ctx(pid_t pid, const struct task_struct *ctx);
pid_t __pid_to_vpid_ctx_excp(pid_t pid, int pidspace_id,const struct task_struct *ctx);
and reverse.
The VPID_2_PID and PID_2_VPID still remain at same locations.
Did I get your comments correctly, Eric ?..
Thanks as usual
