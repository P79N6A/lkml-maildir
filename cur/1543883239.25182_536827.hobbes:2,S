Hmm.
I reported a bug on 2006-08-07 ("ISDN/hisax doesn't work on ARM 
architecture"):
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6970
There was not much activity there... and the bug is still opened in 
kernel's bugzilla.
However, I received two emails from Andrew Morton on 02.10.2006 - one 
with a patch, and the second (automated?) which said:
The patch titled
      isdn: work around excessive udelay()
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename is
      isdn-work-around-excessive-udelay.patch
This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a 
subsystem tree
I'm very happy that the bug was fixed, but why wasn't it automatically 
closed in bugzilla (I closed it only today as I looked up into bugzilla)?
Do we have some wrong communication here? How many bugs are there that 
are falsely opened, when in reality they were resolved long ago?
