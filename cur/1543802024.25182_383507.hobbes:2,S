Ok. Well, it's much more simple for me to implement smbus (with a few extensions
like block transfer) than the low level i2c at the host driver level.
In order to implement subaddress access with repeat start (very common in pretty
much everything nowadays), I need two messages. However, my low level hardware
can't implement everything that can be done with multiple messages. Thus
implementing the stuff using i2c_xfer needs a lot of test & validation all over
the place to coerce those 2 messages into a subaddress + data setup that my low
level hw understands. Implementing only smbus is simpler and fits most of my needs.

I find that weird but heh...

Ok, I'll test with those, I did an equivalent local to my sound drivers
but a wrapper in the i2c layer is probably better. Thanks.
