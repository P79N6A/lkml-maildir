64-bit value for which? For seconds? Do we need to support timeouts of
longer than 4 milliard seconds? We can't currently come close to that
anyway -- we're limited to LONG_MAX / HZ seconds, and if the user asks
for more than that then it appears to be silently switched to an
infinite timeout.

I think it would be best to behave likewise for pselect().
