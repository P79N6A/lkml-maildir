Hi,
This patch does not fix it all! The problem is in fact more involved. I also get these BUG reports when I reload kvm-intel.
BUG kmalloc-8: Object already free
[  74.696570] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[   74.696596] 
[   74.697310] INFO: Allocated in strndup_user+0x30/0x62 age=587 cpu=2 pid=1439
[   74.697845] INFO: Freed in kobject_set_name_vargs+0x29/0x32 age=559 cpu=3 pid=1439
[   74.698008] INFO: Slab 0xc16f93a0 used=10 fp=0xf7c9d2d8 flags=0x10000c3
[   74.698008] INFO: Object 0xf7c9d1f8 @offset=504 fp=0xf7c9d578
This happens because, sysdev_class_register assigns a name to the kobject, and kfrees the old name if any. The 
poisoned 'name' object persists in case of statically allocated kobjects and as its passed to kfree again when re 
registered, we get the above warning.
So, AFAICS the best way to solve this is by fixing the kobject users (kvm, oprofile etc.) to use dynamic kobjects instead 
of static ones or memset the kobject to zero before passing it to sysdev_register.
Greg ?
