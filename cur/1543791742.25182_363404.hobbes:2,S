Almost IMHO as locked pages in RAM avoid swapping totally. Probably
"complement each other" is more correct.
Given the limit for "max locked memory" it should pretty much behave the
same if the process gets on his limits.
OK, the difference may be loaded executable and lib pages.
Hmm, delivering a signal on the first swapped out page might be another
simple solution and the process might do something to avoid it.
The nice thing about "swap ulimit" is: It is easy to understand what it
is (which is always a good thing).
Generating a similar effect with the combination of 2 other features is
probably somewhat more arcane.
