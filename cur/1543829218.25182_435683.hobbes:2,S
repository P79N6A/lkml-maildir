Unfortunately I can do that much with FreeBSD 4.x
with 1 2.0Ghz opteron, so its not a very
compelling case to have to spend twice as much on
hardware to use LINUX. However 2.4 seemed much
better than 2.6 in this regard. 2.6 wants to drop
a lot more packets. The goal of using 2.6 is to
utilize DP better, but it obviously has to
perform better than a UP Freebsd box.
What ITR setting are using for the e1000 driver?

I'm curious as to why a vm setting is useful, as
it doesn't seem that the e1000 driver uses
virtual memory? Since rings are replenished with
sk_buffs, and sk_buffs have to be contiguous, how
does vm come into play?
