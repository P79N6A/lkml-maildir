stockk market highlights and investemnt advice
Fellow Investorr, big news are hitting on thursday for AG AO!!!
Somebody knows something...place A GAO on the radar!!!
Get ready for a volatile 2nd half of 2006 - one where the Bulls and 
Bears will BOTH be proved wrong. But odds are, we'll see another 
year where the makret indexes bounce around a lot without really going anywhere. And we'll also see certain sectors - favored at this point in the economic cycle - SOAR... 
Own the right sttocks, in the right space, and you could reap a 
handful of money-doublers. But if you own the wrong investment, you could easly lose 25%-35% or more! 
Here is my Favorite Pick for the second half of 2006: AGA O!!!

The early bird catches the worm There is always somebody worst of then yourself no matter how bad things seem . Success has many fathers, while failure is an orphan For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life. Money is the root of all evil  When gaulding see fish he forget seh gun deh..
