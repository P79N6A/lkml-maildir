Andr`ea,
	In the second patch you wrote i think it might be better not to
perform the goodness evaluation series multiple times (runtime
optimization). Heres a possible solution... Heres normal diff to sched.c
for 2.3.14.

All this does is check at the start to see if the process could be
real-time. Only perform the relation check if the process is not
real-time. Also, it takes an assignment and an evalutaion out of the lock
section to reduce time in lock. please let me know if this is there is a
problem with this approach.
Sincerely,
JCN
ps. what happened to evaluating the avg slice vs cache_flush time? 
pps. Ill benchmark this stuff on monday.
