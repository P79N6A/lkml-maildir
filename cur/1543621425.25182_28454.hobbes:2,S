Ouch, its *big*. You should probably start pushing it to Jens ASAP,
because if you'll clean up it a bit more, you'll end with really big
patch which rewrites whole drivers/ide... [Not that it would be a bad
thing.]
My favourite cleanup would be 
struct ide_drive_s {} ide_drive_t;
=>
struct ide_drive {};
and replacing all ide_drive_t with struct ide_drive...
