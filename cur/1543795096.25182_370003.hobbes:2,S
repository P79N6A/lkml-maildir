You're saying that Arima machine only runs with LinuxBIOS so far?

SRAT is definitely the wave of the future.  I'm going to keep
the old code working as long as it's relatively cleanly possible.
But this needs to make some assumptions, and in particular your
discontiguous APIC IDs broke that. I don't plan to try to handle
every weird case in this case - if your setup is really
weird use SRAT.
Regarding the BSP 0 - you probably just have a stupid bug
somewhere that breaks the timer interrupt. I don't know
of any hardware issue that would prevent the timer interrupt
going to a APIC ID != 0. There are some troubles with timer
interrupts, but they are different issues. IMHO the discontig
APIC IDs was just a workaround because you didn't want to fix
the interrupt routing properly, with the burden on the kernel.
You have two options now:
- Trace down why interrupt 0 doesn't work with BSP LAPIC != 0
and fix that. 
- Provide SRAT.
First is probably better, although the second also wouldn't hurt.

Yes it complicates the logic enough and makes it more fragile,
which would be a long term maintenance issue. The only way 
to keep the fallback code alive at all is to keep it simple
and clean.
