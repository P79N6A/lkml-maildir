Every git-foo.patch in -mm identifies where it came from in its changelog.
The first few lines of
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.24-rc6/2.6.24-rc6-mm1/broken-out/git-x86.patch
are:
GIT 27197ba67cbaa0e22598a10c82b10dacb1309ed8 irqs_disabled
git+ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git#mm
I'm not sure what the "irqs_disabled\n\n" is doing there: maybe I added it
by mistake.  2.6.24-rc5-mm1 correctly had
GIT b668e28b74558b3a8277b5fde363ae5f803b36f0 git+ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git#mm
But still.  The git URL is always there.
