You're assuming a brain-dead application.  Which can already thrash the
disk very nicely with O_SYNC.  Yes, if you ask for control and then do
something stupid, you can send performance into the toilet.
That's not a reason to not do what the application asks unless it's
a serious DoS attack.
(For example, In my appliction, I'm using a raw device as a circular
buffer, so I'm already delivering perfectly sequential block numbers.
And it's a flash memory disk anyway.)

I know the operating system doesn't know.  If it did, there wouldn't
be any need for the application to tell it by making a system call.
So do what the application asks for, which is what the SuS says
msync(MS_ASYNC) means, which is start the write immediately.
(I'd call it "I/O", but it's only "O".)
As I said, I'm actively looking for a way, on Linux 2.6.x, x <= 15,
to start disk writes on part of an mmapped file without either blocking
(yet) or writing other dirty pages that aren't complete yet.
