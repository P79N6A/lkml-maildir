   I can't say I like these fixes much.
How about contributing some time to figuring out what
the problem is instead of complaining all the time?
%99 of people with sparc32 problems are totally unwilling (or unable)
to help fix the bugs themselves, they merely whine.  It gets a bit
old after a while (which for me amount to roughly 7 years).
