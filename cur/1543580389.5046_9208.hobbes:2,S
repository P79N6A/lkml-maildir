Unfortionatly, this is impossible. The miropcm config question is asked
before the "sound" question, and the aci question is asked after that (all
in ake config). In 2.2.x we have an #ifdef in the driver that causes an
#error with a description of the problem and the solution. Someone stripped
that #ifdef out of the driver during 2.3.something.
