Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Linus,
PowerPC has a conditional trap instruction that I would like to use
for BUG_ON.  I would like to make BUG_ON for ppc look like this:
#define BUG_ON(x) do {						\
	__asm__ __volatile__(					\
		"1:	twnei %0,0\n"				\
		".section __bug_table,\"a\"\n"			\
		"	.long 1b,%1,%2\n"			\
		".previous"					\
		: : "r" (x), "i" (__LINE__), "i" (__FILE__));	\
} while (0)
This avoids a conditional branch and is nice and compact.  (The twnei
instruction takes an exception if the register operand is not equal
to the immediate operand - trap word not equal immediate.)
However, at the moment BUG_ON is unconditionally defined in kernel.h.
The patch below is the simplest way I can see to make it possible for
architectures to supply their own BUG_ON.  Please apply.
Thanks,
Paul.
