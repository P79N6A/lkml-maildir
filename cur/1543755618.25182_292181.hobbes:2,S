I'm afraid, I'm not going to change it. I already lost too much time
pushing LRW into the kernel. 
Coding time: 3 days. Pushing time: 78 days and counting. 
I'm willing to cancel my work, as I've taken this to matter to an
extend, where my time sacrifice can hardly be justified. Especially, if
James ask me to redo Michal's conflicting patches (done btw), which are
totally off-topic for me. Then, I'm certainly not going to redo all my
code, just because someone thinks different about the naming of my
variables.
