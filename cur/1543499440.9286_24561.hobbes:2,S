Since the above is not a normal situation, traditional security
behaves oddly. Some "features" just suck.

This must be stopped:
ln /etc/passwd ~/passwd
chown user.group ~/passwd
The UNIX standard would let us restrict the first operation.
With that absurdity fixed, chown could be relaxed a bit.
Perhaps this: allow chown when the directory owner and new
file owner are both in the set of UIDs held by the process.
That gives you a "take ownership" in directories you own.
