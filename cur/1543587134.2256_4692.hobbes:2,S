the system I implemented this in went from 25 Millisecond resolution to 25-60
Nanosecond resolution (depending on the CPU underneath).  that is a theoretical
factor of 500,000 to 1,000,000 improvement in resolution for timed events, and
the clock overhead after the change was about the same. (+-10% depending on
underlying CPU)
this is on a system that only had one clock tick per process quantum, as
opposed to the 10 in linux.
