Please keep them!

Again, based on what line of reasoning?  Again, the obvious lines
of reasoning do not apply.

From my earlier message (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/4/244
):
	Agreed, in that I know of no binary module that uses RCU.  However,
	I cannot -prove- that there is no such module.
IOW, I am also not 100% sure that there is really no binary-only module
using these symbols by -anyone-, including someone -other- than IBM.
In addition, I know of no way that -anyone- could possibly be 100% sure
that there is really no binary-only module using symbols.  Hence the
approach of providing the year "grace period" before transitioning to
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().

I am not convinced that the risk of usage increases significantly.
However, even if someone does start using them in a binary module, they
will have been warned.  Yes, someone could possibly ignore the warning.
They -still- will have been warned, so that any "damage" would be
self-inflicted.  Therefore, as noted earlier, the symbol transitions
to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() one year after its inclusion, regardless of any
people who ignored warnings.
