FYI, the up front checks in XFS are simply to stop new I/O from starting
if we're already in the shutdown state.
However, there's more than that in XFS - there's checks all through
it's I/O paths so that I/Os and transactions in flight at (or
started after) the time of the shutdown can be aborted before doing
further damage to a potentially corrupted filesystem. This part
cannot be done generically as it is intimately tied to the
filesystem.
It is also worth noting that XFS won't shutdown a filesystem on just
any I/O error. Shutdowns due to I/O errors only occur when the
failure has the potential to leave the filesystem in an inconsistent
state.  Hence any given operation can return different errors
depending on where the I/O error occurred in XFS and what effect
that I/O error has on the consistency of the filesystem.....
BTW, the correct list to use to get the attention of the XFS folk
is linux-xfs@oss.sgi.com.
Cheers,
Dave.
