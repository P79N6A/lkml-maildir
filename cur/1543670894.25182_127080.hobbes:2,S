Hello!
I feel myself stupid, when fighting against setup.S. Here is small piece of 
code (/arch/i386/boot/setup.S)
--->
start_of_setup: # line 160
	# bla bla bla - some checking code
        movb    $1, %al
        movb    %al, (0x100)
....
....
        pushw   %ax
        movb    (0x100), %al
        cmpb    $1, %al
        popw    %ax # pop don't change any flags - 386 asm reference
        je     bail820 # and it don't jump -- al != 1
meme820: # line 300
<---
Any ideas? I've spent two days, trying to understand what's going on - no luck 
at all...
Best regards,
Andrew.
