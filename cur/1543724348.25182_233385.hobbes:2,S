Are you sure that both artsd and jackd is run as RT processes?
artsd needs 'artswrapper' as suid root and option in kconfig enabled.
(never versions of amarok warns the user if this is not the case...)
[You can try to run the same as root to be sure]
But it does sound as a io scheduler problem - but 2-3 seconds!?
