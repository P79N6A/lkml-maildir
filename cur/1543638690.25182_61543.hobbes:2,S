Hi there,
could you please consider changing those very slow behaviour in 
"drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c"? ... Benchmarked against 2.4.18 this is horribly 
slower ... Doing some heavy disk i/o, want to start another thing, system 
freeze for some seconds ... Opening a xterm , Ctrl-D to leave, this takes 
about 5 seconds and somewhat is doing flushing to the disk.
Maybe req_finished_io ?
Adrian, could this be the problem you've experienced?
Afaik this was changed for 2.4.19-pre7 and above.
