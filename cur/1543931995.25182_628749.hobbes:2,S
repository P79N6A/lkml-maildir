yes, sorry, I meant ordered.

I think you have ~2G of RAM and you're running with 
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio=10, yes?
If so, when that machine hits 10% * 2G of dirty memory then everyone who
wants to dirty pages gets blocked.

Ah.  It has a bug in it ;)
As I said, data=journal has exceptional handling of pagecache data and is
not well tested.  Someone (and I'm not sure who) will need to get in there
and fix it.
