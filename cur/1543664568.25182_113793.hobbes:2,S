'Licenced' is not OK in the UK; it should be corrected to 'Licensed'.
In the UK, 'licence' is a noun, 'license' is a verb -- just as with
practice/practise and advice/advise etc. in both variants of the
language.
I think we also want to add:
Decompressing=Uncompressing
You should also refrain from 'correcting' the already-correct British
spellings of 'modelled'.
It might also be worth adding a list of 'suspect' spellings -- which
require human intervention. Such items might include 'indices=indexes'
and 'erratum=errata' although you can't do it automatically because
sometimes the right-hand side is actually correct.
