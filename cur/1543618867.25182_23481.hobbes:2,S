Subject: [PATCH] Fix NR_IRQS when no IO apic
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

NR_IRQS should be 16 when the IO apic is not configured, as the 8259 PIC
cannot generate any more interrupts.  It also fixes a bug where the IDT
gets populated with random addresses, since only 16 entry stubs are
created.
