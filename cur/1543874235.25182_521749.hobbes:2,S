Here is the output of /proc/interrupts on 2.6.20:
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:       7089          0  local-APIC-edge-fasteio   timer
....
and this on 2.6.21-rc*:
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:        255          0  local-APIC-edge-fasteoi   timer
....
on 2.6.21-rc* the number "255" doesn't change.
But if it is ACPI relevant, shouldn't it boot with acpi=off?
I've tried with acpi=off and noapic but only with nolapic it started.
And the content of /proc/acpi/processor/C000/power shows only one
c-state; shouldn't it show more C-states? (please correct me if I'm
wrong)
 # cat /proc/acpi/processor/C000/power
active state:            C1
max_cstate:              C8
bus master activity:     00000000
maximum allowed latency: 2000 usec
states:
   *C1:                  type[C1] promotion[--] demotion[--]
latency[000] usage[00000000] duration[00000000000000000000]
