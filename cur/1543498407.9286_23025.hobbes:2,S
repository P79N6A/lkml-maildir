-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
The second pre-release for strace 4.0 has been released. The new
version number is 3.99.1, and you can get it from the usual places,
which are mentioned below.
Changes since 3.99:
* strace works correctly on Linux sparc now
* strace doesn't segfault on alpha anymore
* compiles and works correctly on solaris
Some issues that should be resolved before strace 4.0 is
released:
* Linux powerpc gets the stat structure wrong
* fstat decoding fails on Linux alpha (might be an alignment/64-bit
  problem in sendmail?)
There is now also an strace mailinglist. You can subscribe by sending
an email with the subject "subscribe" to strace-request@lists.wiggy.net.
You can post to the list by sending mail to strace@lists.wiggy.net.
You can get strace at two locations:
 * homepage at 
http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~wichert/strace/
 * CVS archive at :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/strace,
   password is empty
