Dear One,
It is my pleasure to acquaint you with this proposal for the purpose of
investment in your country under your management. I am MISS FATI ZONGO the only
daughter of late JULLIUS ZONGO from Sierra Leone.
My late father was a gold and diamond merchant based in Freetown, Sierra-Leone.
As a result of the political instability of Sierra-Leone, my late father
packaged USD35,500,000.00, Thirty five million, five hundred thousand dollars
in cash which he deposited in a Security Institution for security reasons. He
declared the deposit as Personal Effects as shown in the certificate of deposit
in my possession.
I am here seeking for an avenue to transfer this money to a reliable and
trustworthy individual for investment and management purpose.
I am here as a refugee because of the political crisis in my country Sierra
Leone. Please I would offer you 25% of the total sum of USD35.5M for your
assistance.Please I need to transfer this money urgently because delay would
not help at all and I need to relocate based on the political instability in
this sub-region,to enable me continue my education because i was medical
student before the death of my parents.
Your immediate response would be appreciated.
Best regards,
MISS FATI ZONGO.
