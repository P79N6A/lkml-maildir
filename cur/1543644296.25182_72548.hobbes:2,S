Not sure about the serial code. 
However you can't update the keyboard LEDs at anything like normal serial port 
rates. And even if you could update at 10kHz, you just varied the brightness, 
rather than caused any real "blinking"

You are going to cause problems. There are other users of keyboard LEDs in the 
kernel (eg for notifying of an oops). It isn't looking too good.
If you are really intent on doing this, you can probably manage this from 
userspace, using the event interface and the application that is sending data 
over the serial interface. Of course, you'd need to have a suitable keyboard 
(probably only USB or ADB in 2.4.x).
