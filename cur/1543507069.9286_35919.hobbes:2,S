Well, here, were are working on workstations provided with 64, 128 or
256MB. Some of them have'nt any problemn for detecting the whole mem,
others cannot do this.
And the option "os/2 detect <64Mb" in bios has no effect (in fact no
GOOD effect: my pc detect 64mb on 128 with this option disabled and 16
when enabled ...)
But this is more a problem whith bogus bioses than whith kernel.
unfortunately, this is on what final users'll judge linux.
