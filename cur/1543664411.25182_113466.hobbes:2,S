Can you define a generic address?
IIRC, ACPI needs some work in this area.
If the "generic address" is host RAM, that's easy.
If the generic address is PIO address, that's mostly easy.
If the generic address is MMIO address, that takes a bit of care with
mapping, and I'm not sure ACPI gets it right in these cases.
