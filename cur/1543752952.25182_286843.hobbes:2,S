It Works For Me(tm). This is unpatched 2.6.11-rc1-mm1 (no patches
reverted too):
# uname -r
2.6.11-rc1-mm1
# cat /proc/mdstat 
Personalities : [raid0] [raid1] [raid5] [multipath] [raid10] 
Event: 2                   
md1 : active raid10 sdd2[3] sdc2[2] sdb2[1] sda2[0]
      70684416 blocks 128K chunks 2 near-copies [4/4] [UUUU]
      
md0 : active raid1 sdd1[3] sdc1[2] sdb1[1] sda1[0]
      500608 blocks [4/4] [UUUU]
      
unused devices: <none>
# mount
/dev/md1 on / type reiser3 (rw,sync,data=journal,barrier=flush)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
/dev/md0 on /boot type ext2 (ro)
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw)
So the problem depends on something. This system is SCSI, and I don't
use modules. I'm happy to provide more info if that would be of any
help.
