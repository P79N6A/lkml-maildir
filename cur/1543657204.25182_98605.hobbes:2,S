Right...  So basically it can be claimed to be a 16-bit ADC as long as
it is noiseless above 96 dB, when all of the inputs to the ADC are
correctly terminated directly at the ADC inputs.
I just think it's funny that loads of "16-bit" soundcards are
effectively only 12-bit soundcards :-).  Especially as that's about
the noise-floor of good quality vinyl :-).

Good idea - I'd be grateful if more manufacturers would supply a
datasheet at all :-).
