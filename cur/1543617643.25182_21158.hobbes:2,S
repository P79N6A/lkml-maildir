the debugging prospective is probably the one I care less (you can
always drop a __GFP_HIGHMEM into the right alloc_pages to get the memory
direct mapped) that's most of the time a one liner in just one place.
Here I'd care more about the fact if it's really needed in real life or
not, if kmaps would be zero cost it would be probably ok anyways (modulo
increase of code complexity), but kmaps are lightweight but not zero
cost :).
