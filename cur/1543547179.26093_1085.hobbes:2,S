Ok, so please comment on the description below:
- Userspace:
	sd = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, 0); (Is this correct??)
	bind(how do I bind this socket to the interface, if I don't have 
	     an address?? Can I just make one up??);
	send(sd, data, len);
- Kernel:
	"send" makes kernel call dev_queue_xmit(), which will call the 
	driver's hard_start_xmit function.
Questions:
- Do I need to bring the interface up with ifconfig before being able to
  do this?? My question is because ifconfig doesn't have a "raw mode"
  address family ...
- Who opens the interface, if not ifconfig??
Sorry for my dumb questions, and thanks for your help!!
Later,
Ivan
