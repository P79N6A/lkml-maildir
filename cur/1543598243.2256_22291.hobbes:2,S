No, we don't do any such frobbing of the cache control registers.
It is enabled in the BIOS right ?
Another thing that it might be, is if you're using ACPI instead of
APM, the cpu-idle may be causing the CPU to run slower than usual
though throttling.
Although, I've not seen this happen to the extent of what you're
reporting.  If you are running with an ACPI kernel, try booting
with an APM kernel instead to see if it makes a difference.
regards,
Dave.
