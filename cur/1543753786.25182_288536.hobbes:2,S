It's dependent on the architecture already. I would like to enable
it on i386/x86-64 because the kernel command line is often used
to pass parameters to installers, and having a small limit there
can be awkward.
But first need to figure out what went wrong with EDD. 
Matt D., do you have thoughts on this?
