I was thinking of doing some similar updates this evening after work. 
Darn it... now I have to find something else to do!  :-)
Going by this morning's comments from Richard Gooch, it sounds like the
	if (rio->devfs == NULL)
		dbg("probe_rio: device node registration failed");
part should probably be removed... it looks good to me otherwise, tho. 
I'll try it out tonight and post the results.
Cheers!
