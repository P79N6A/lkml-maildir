All the functionality of the original driver should still be there.
Are you referring to the chunk of code in cpqhpc_probe() that bases
on the subsystem ID to detect the capability of the HPC.  This 
feature is in phphpc_get_ctrl_cap() in cpqphp_hpc.c.  This patch use
a 16-bit variable, pctlrcap, to capture the capability and decode it
when needed. I can provide more detail information on this if you 
need. Let me know if there are some other features you found missing.

This patch has moved the code around quite a bit to separate out the 
resource gathering code to support both HRT & ACPI, and to put the 
code that is specific to the Compaq HPC HW programming model in 
cpqphp_hpc.c.  If you feel there is a need to split the patch into 
smaller ones, we can further discuss on that.
Thanks,
Dely
