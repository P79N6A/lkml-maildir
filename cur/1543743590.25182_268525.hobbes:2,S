this fixed the problem for me too.
However I'm not convinced this is correct, nothing in the kernel should
ever free a bootmem piece of memory after the machine has booted.
If this helps, it also means we found an existing pte (not pmd) with
page_count 0 during the first unmap event (bootmem allocated). The
transition from mapped to unmapped works fine, but the transition from
unmapped to mapped will thorw the pte away and we'll regenerate a 2M pmd
where there was a pte instead. I wonder why there are 4k pages there in
the first place.
Anyways I understand what's going on now thanks to your debugging, and I
believe the only real fix is to use PageReserved to catch if we're
working on a newly allocated page or not, I don't like to depend on the
page_count being 0 for the bootmem pages like the previous code was
doing. I believe my code would now fall apart even if you were using it
with PSE disabled (nopentium or something). So I've to fix that bit at
least and I will use PageReserved for that.
The page_count of bootmem pages really doesn't matter since they must
never be freed. It really should remain 0 so we catch if anybody
executes a put_page on it.
I'll fix it up...
