Perhaps even more importantly, things get merged one change
at a time, and stabilised one change at a time.  This is a
big change from the even/odd numbered kernel series, where
sometimes a bug crops up without anybody knowing exactly
what change introduced it.
The current development model seems to go much smoother than
anything I've seen before.
