Where is the prove for that? Why can't the same rules apply to dynamic and 
static trace points?
You're also mixing up function tracing with event tracing. Most of the LTT 
trace points log rather high level events, which are rather unlikely to  
disappear. It's more likely that the place where they are generated is 
moved and then it's only advantageous if the marker is moved as well at 
the same time. OTOH if the actual event really is not generated anymore, 
there is also no need for the marker anymore.
