I can try to give you an example.  I re-released the Linux-AFS kernel
module 9 times for various 2.0.x kernels.  I should note that I chose
not to support every 2.0.x kernel, generally because sometimes a
second new kernel was released before I finished releasing a module,
so I chose to use the most recent kernel.  As a result, there are
undoubtedly hidden incompatibilities that my list doesn't show.  There
were also cases where adjacent kernels _did_ work, but I don't have
those details here, either.  FWIW, Linux 2.0.36 works with the 2.0.35
kernel module.
Here are the various 2.0.x kernels for which I released Linux-AFS:
	2.0.4
	2.0.11
	2.0.12
	2.0.18
	2.0.21
	2.0.29
	2.0.30
	2.0.32
	2.0.35
Gee, 9/36  -- 25% success rate, not bad. ;-)
