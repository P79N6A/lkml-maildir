	Uhm, then why all the fuss about blind-filtering and being stuck in
someone's IP addy space?  If their own servers are filtering out traffic from
ORBS, then block those servers.  People in their address space who run their
own domains/servers/etc shouldn't be affected by that.  If you use their
servers for your service, then bitch at them.  Otherwise, just run your own. :)
