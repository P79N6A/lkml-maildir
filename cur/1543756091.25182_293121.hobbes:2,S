You could also try Xnest, which runs a second X-server within a window 
of
the primary X-server, except without most of the extra overhead of VNC 
or
other image-based solutions. Xnest can even handle different bit-depths
than the primary display, and only slightly modifies most X calls, 
except
for the ones that affect global state, which it processes internally.
