No, there's still no way to ask the driver whether hardware mixing is
supported yet.  It's come up on alsa-devel before.  Patches are welcome.
dmix by default would not be nice as users who have sound cards that can
do hardware mixing would be annoyed.  However, in the upcoming 1.0.9
release softvol will be used by default for all the mobo chipsets.
