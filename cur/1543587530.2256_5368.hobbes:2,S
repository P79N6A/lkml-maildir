We have -got- to get 2.4 stable and sane first.  It's a psychological
thing, but if Linus opens 2.5 now, people will ignore the existing 2.4
problems that need attention.
If LVM et. al. is fundamentally broken in 2.4, then mark it experimental
and support it via external patches.  That's the way these things are
always dealt it, when you need a feature set beyond the existing stable
kernel.
Patience, grasshopper :)
