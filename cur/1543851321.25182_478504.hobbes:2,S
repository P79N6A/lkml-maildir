Subject: [PATCH 1/2] UML - Fix I/O hang
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch fixes a UML hang in which everything would just stop until
some I/O happened - a ping, someone whacking the keyboard - at which
point everything would start up again as though nothing had happened.
The cause was gcc reordering some code which absolutely needed to be
executed in the order in the source.  When unblock_signals switches
signals from off to on, it needs to see if any interrupts had happened
in the critical section.  The interrupt handlers check signals_enabled -
if it is zero, then the handler adds a bit to the "pending" bitmask
and returns.  unblock_signals checks this mask to see if any signals
need to be delivered.
The crucial part is this:
	signals_enabled = 1;
	save_pending = pending;
	if(save_pending == 0)
		return;
	pending = 0;
In order to avoid an interrupt arriving between reading pending and
setting it to zero, in which case, the record of the interrupt would
be erased, signals are enabled.
What happened was that gcc reordered this so that 'save_pending = pending'
came before 'signals_enabled = 1', creating a one-instruction window
within which an interrupt could arrive, set its bit in pending, and
have it be immediately erased.
When the I/O workload is purely disk-based, the loss of a block device
interrupt stops the entire I/O system because the next block request
will wait for the current one to finish.  Thus the system hangs until
something else causes some I/O to arrive, such as a network packet or
console input.
The fix to this particular problem is a memory barrier between
enabling signals and reading the pending signal mask.  An xchg would
also probably work.
Looking over this code for similar problems led me to do a few more
things -
	make signals_enabled and pending volatile so that they don't
get cached in registers
	add an mb() to the return paths of block_signals and
unblock_signals so that the modification of signals_enabled doesn't
get shuffled into the caller in the event that these are inlined in
the future.
