The only thing that works properly for me is either x11amp or amp-0.7.6.
amp-0.7.6 was compiled to do realtime stuff and has to run as root.
All the other players I've tried skip to some degree. When playing a mp3
from cd I have the odd skip as the cd spins up, amp reads some stuff,
the cd spins down, amp wants to read more and skips while the cd spins
up and so on ... irritating.
I wrote a little read-mp3-into 5 Meg buffer thing and then pipe into amp
/proc/self/fd/0 (or is it 1?) which worked quite nicely for that. The
code for that seems to be gone now as I trashed my one drive but it
shouldn't be hard to write something like that again.
