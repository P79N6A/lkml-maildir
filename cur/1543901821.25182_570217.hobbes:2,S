Subject: [PATCH]: Fix hrtimer hotplug cpu notifier bug on 64-bit.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I discussed this with Thomas Gleixner last night and he
seemed to be OK with fixing the problem as follows.
If he wants to do things differently, he can submit an alternate
change, but this thing is quite trivial so I doubt that will happen
:-)
Please apply, thanks.
[HRTIMER]: Fix cpu pointer arg to clockevents_notify().
All of the clockevent notifiers expect a pointer to
an "unsigned int" cpu argument, but hrtimer_cpu_notify()
passes in a pointer to a long.
