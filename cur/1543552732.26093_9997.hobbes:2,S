When I run "/sbin/shutdown -r now" on a SiS5582 based system with a Cyrix
MII cpu, the machine shuts down as far printing: Rebooting system. It then
hangs. This is a RedHat 7.0 based system (The kernel was compiled with
RedHat 6.2)
The lspci on the system gives:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 5597 [SiS5582] (rev 10)
00:01.0 ISA bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 85C503/5513 (rev 01)
00:01.1 IDE interface: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 5513 [IDE] (rev d0)
00:0d.0 Ethernet controller: Lite-On Communications Inc LNE100TX (rev 20)
00:14.0 VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 5597/5598 VGA (rev 68)
The machines reboots fine with the shipped RedHat kernel (patched 2.2.16)
