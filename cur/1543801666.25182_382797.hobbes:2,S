Hi All,
First, this is most probably not a kernel issue, but I have exhausted all 
other avenues...
I have an (oldish) Olympic C-420L camera, that attaches via /dev/ttyS0 S1 etc.
The camera now isn't detected anymore, but I don't know when, as I don't use 
it much (maybe 10 times a year).  I have googled to no avail.  On my end, 
everything _appears_ to be working, but the camera isn't detected anymore, as 
it has been for the last 2 years:
nick@linuxamd:nick$ dmesg | grep serial
serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
serial8250: ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
nick@linuxamd:nick$ sudo /sbin/setserial /dev/ttyS0
/dev/ttyS0, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x03f8, IRQ: 4
nick@linuxamd:nick$ sudo /sbin/setserial /dev/ttyS1
/dev/ttyS1, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x02f8, IRQ: 3
nick@linuxamd:nick$ gphoto2 --list-ports
Devices found: 7
Path                             Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
serial:/dev/ttyS0                Serial Port 0
serial:/dev/ttyS1                Serial Port 1
serial:/dev/ttyS2                Serial Port 2
serial:/dev/ttyS3                Serial Port 3
usb:                             Universal Serial Bus
usb:002,004                      Universal Serial Bus
usb:002,003                      Universal Serial Bus
nick@linuxamd:nick$ gphoto2 --auto-detect
Model                          Port
----------------------------------------------------------
I have no other serial devices I can test with.  Is there anything I can 
run/test to check what is happening...
TIA,
Nick
