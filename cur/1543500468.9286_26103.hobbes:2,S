   The NT boot loader can read the registry. It must do this for i18n
   support at least. (it then loads a variety of files)
That's because the NT boot loader can read files from the "root
filesystem".  So in some sense it has effectively "mounted" the root
filesystem.  (Yes, I know, there's really a stub "boot-only" filesystem
driver which the NT boot loader uses, and the *real* filesystem code is
loaded by the NT boot loader later.)  But effectively, though, you
couldn't store the location of the root/boot filesystem in the registry,
since the NT boot loader needs to know where to find the root/boot
filesystem in order to read the registry....
