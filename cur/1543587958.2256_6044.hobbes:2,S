Subject: [PATCH] SCSI command bytes are copied twice
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

SCSI subsystem needs to copy the SCSI command bytes into a Scsi_Request 
structure for a SCSI command being issued by one of the higher level
drivers before it queues the command up. It does this copy twice. Even
though this will cause no more than 12 bytes to be copied twice, this
code is still invoked frequently enough to justify not incurring the 
overhead of a redundant copy. Following patch should fix this.
Thanks,
Khalid
