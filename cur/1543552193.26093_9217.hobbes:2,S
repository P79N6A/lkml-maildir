Hi,
I use the serial cart with 5.03 / 2.2.17
Serial driver version 5.03 (2000-08-11) with MANY_PORTS SHARE_IRQ SERIAL_PCI enabled
00:0d.0 Serial controller: Timedia Technology Co Ltd: Unknown device 7168 (rev 01)
I realized it can crash easy a system:
run kermit on a ttySX to an another box.
when you get the terminal just disconnect the cable 
and connect it on a another serial port (without any output)
now quit kermit: your system should be crashed.
another bug (known bug I think) is: if you use
a serial cable not connected, your system crashs
on the boot.
I tested thoses bugs on freebsd. it seems to work on *bsd
hope it helps
Octave
