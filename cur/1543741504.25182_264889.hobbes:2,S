If you want jogdial to continue generating BTN_MIDDLE and BTN_WHEEL
events then IMHO you should create 2 separate input devices - one
for jogdial and the other for FN-keys.
On the other hand I am not sure if it is handy as a ponter device -
I think scrolling is much more natural with the touchpad (but
remember I don't have the hardware) and it may be more convenient
to assign brand-new events to jogdial as well and then map it in
userspace (X) into something different, like volume control. In
this case you can continue having just one input device.
Btw, you should probably drop conditional support for input layer
and always compile it in.
