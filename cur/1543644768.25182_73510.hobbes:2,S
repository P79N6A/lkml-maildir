FROM THE DESK OF MR.UNONGO.CAMARA
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
FOREIGN REMMITTANCE DEPT.
BANQUE INTERNATIONALE DU ABIDJAN
ABIDJAN, COTE D,IVOIRE
PHONE:00225 0706 5026
Dear friend,
With due respect and humility, I pass to you this
information.I am the manager of bill and exchange at the
foreign remittance department of Banque Internationale
du Abidjan . 
In my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of
U.S$17m US dollars (seventeen millionUS dollars) . In
an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers
who died along with his entire family in november 1997
in a plane crash.
Since we got information about his death, we have been
expecting his next of kin to come forward and claim
his money because we cannot release it unless somebody
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and
policies but unfortunately ,we could not locate anybody. It 
is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to 
make good use of this opportunity. so what you have to do 
is to aply as the next of kin to the deseased so that we 
can release the money to you since nobody is coming forth 
and I dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury as 
unclaimed Bill.
According to our Banking ethics and guideline here
which stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed
after five years, the money will automatically be
transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. 
The request of foreigner as next of kin in this
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer
was a foreigner and an IVIORIAN cannot stand as next of
kin to a foreigner.I have decided that 25 % of this money
will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the
provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be for 
reimbursement of any expenses incured during the
curse of the transaction and 65 % would be for me 
There after I will visit your country for disbursement 
according to the percentages indicated.
Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this
fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the
bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased
indicating your bank name, your bank account
number, your private telephone and fax number for
easier and effective communication and location where
the money will be remitted .
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax
or email the text of the application. I will not fail
to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch
free and that you should not entertain any atom of 
fear as all required arrangements have been made for
the transfer .You should contact me immediately as
soon as you receive this letter.Trusting to hear from
you immediately.
Yours faithfully,
FROM THE DESK OF MR. UNONGO.CAMARA
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
FOREIGN REMMITTANCE DEPT.
