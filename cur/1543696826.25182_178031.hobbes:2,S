Not really, the revision history of the CVS gateway predates Pavel's so-called
hacks.
I don't mind us supporting this gateway for the small number of users, if it 
makes them happy, that's fine.  What I mind is people coming back and asking
for more stuff for a tiny number of people.  That doesn't make sense.  We 
should put our efforts into helping the people using BK, not the people using
CVS.  If you want to help yourselves, that's a fine idea, go for it.
