Subject: 2.6.20-rc2-mm1:  Makefile drops local version when checking headers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When building 2.6.20-rc2-mm1 with CHECK_HEADERS=y, the Makefile will
build the target "include/config/kernel.release" twice.  The first time,
the CONFIG_LOCALVERSION [and any auto local version] will correctly be
appended.  Then, when it builds the "headers_check" target, the Makefile
will build the "include/config/kernel.release" target again, dropping
the local version information.  If you then do a "make
[modules_]install" in this tree, the install will use the second version
string w/o the localversion, installing modules in the wrong place and
kernel/initrd with wrong name, possibly overwriting desired copies of
the "2.6.20-rc2-mm1" kernel/modules.
[Aside:  it also appears that several items, including the kernel
itself, get rebuilt during "make [modules_]install" after a successful
"make [all]".  I think this is new behavior.]
This behavior appears to have been introduced by the patch:
build-compileh-earlier.patch
Sorry, no patch to propose.  Simple workaround is just to omit header
checks.
Here's the results of some instrumentation that I added to the Makefile
showing the sequence of targets built and which dependents cause the
build:
-------------------
<first build of target OK>
generating include/config/kernel.release:  2.6.20-rc1-mm1+foo
	KERNELVERSION = 2.6.20-rc1-mm1
	localver-full = +foo
 		localver      = +foo
		localver-auto = 
Target:  include/linux/utsrelease.h
Target:  prepare3
Target:  prepare1
<but later, for headers check>
generating include/config/kernel.release:  2.6.20-rc1-mm1
	KERNELVERSION = 2.6.20-rc1-mm1
	localver-full = 
 		localver      = 
		localver-auto = 
Target:  include/linux/utsrelease.h
Target:  headers_install
Target:  headers_check
----------------------------
