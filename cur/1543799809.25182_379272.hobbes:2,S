 Hello,
  thanks to all the suggestions I've got, I've
 updated my proposal [1] for an RTC subsystem.
  I tried to implement locking wherever necessary.
 I'm on vacations right now and I don't have all the feedback
 emails at handy, so I'm sure I've forgot something.
  I've left some XXX in the points where I have
 doubts.
  The dev interface now supports multiple RTCs and
 hotplug events are generated whenever an RTC is
 added/removed.
 Those udev lines can be used to create the device nodes
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="rtc", ENV{MAJOR}=="[0-9]*",  NAME="rtc%m"
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="rtc", ENV{MINOR}=="0",       SYMLINK+="rtc"
  I also added a test device/driver which can be used 
 to excercize the APIs. This device can also generate
 interrupts using the sysfs interface (more details
 in the path).
  hwclock seems to work fine, both in polling
 and IRQ modes.
