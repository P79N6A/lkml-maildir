It's because CVS cannot handle what BK does. So when you do a BK merge, 
there's no way in hell that will be a CVS merge, and instead it ends up 
being one big commit of the branch.
Merges happen pretty often, so these "big commits" aren't _that_ big
(certainly nowhere near as big as a CVS banch merge tends to be - if only
simply because nobody uses CVS for "small branches", the pain isn't worth
it). 
Face it. BK is just better than CVS. It's not a 1:1 mapping.
