Hi Chris,
I discovered some mount problems/hangs when playing with dvds,
so I gave your patch a try, but it does not apply properly on 
2.4.12. Can you shred some light on this:
drypatch -p1 < /home/hp/Downloads/linux/patch/fslock-2.4.12.dif
patching file fs/super.c
Hunk #2 succeeded at 324 with fuzz 2.
Hunk #3 succeeded at 372 with fuzz 2.
Hunk #4 FAILED at 626.
Hunk #5 FAILED at 639.
Hunk #6 FAILED at 666.
Hunk #7 FAILED at 677.
Hunk #8 FAILED at 783.
Hunk #9 FAILED at 800.
6 out of 9 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file fs/super.c.rej
patching file fs/buffer.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 359 with fuzz 1.
patching file drivers/md/lvm.c
Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n] 
Apply anyway? [n] 
Skipping patch.
Thanks in advance,
Hans-Peter
