Its certainly not a new idea. There are a wide number of trusted computing
situations where high speed public key crypto that is very hard to go around
the back of is a big win (think credit card data for one). 
Its also uninteresting for real security applications because nobody will
be prepared to assume that IBM silicon hasn't been tampered with by the NSA
and friends.
