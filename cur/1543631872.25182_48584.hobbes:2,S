OK, I have a patch almost ready to do that except, I am not sure about 
what to do for those 3 bits...
The *usual* call is :
	pci_write_config_dword(agp_bridge.dev, INTEL_ATTBASE,
			       agp_bridge.gatt_bus_addr);
Where 'gatt_bus_addr' is returned from a 'virt_to_phys' on 
'gatt_table_real'.
Should I mask those three bits out when writing or write
'gatt_bus_addr >> 3' instead ? I am not too sure about the assumptions 
that can be made about what returns 'virt_to_phys' ...
Thanks in advance.
Nicolas.
