Use sysrq-p to show register state.
On SMP, you may need to press it several times, to get the right CPU. And 
if you _never_ get the right CPU, that's likely an indication that it 
disabled interrupts, or your platform just sends all keyboard interrupts 
to the same CPU (try to see what happens with interrupt balancing).
