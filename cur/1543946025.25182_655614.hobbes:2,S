ouch ...
i guess this explains what static code metrics already suggest:
   $ code-quality fs/ext3/ fs/ext4/
                                errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC
   fs/ext3/                        408           16055          25.4
   fs/ext4/                        394           25169          15.6
compared to:
   $ code-quality kernel/
                                errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC
   kernel/                         739           98759           7.4
and i guess our hope is now in:
   $ code-quality fs/btrfs/
                                errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC
   fs/btrfs/                       240           20556          11.6
(which hopefully will be a project done in a much more Linux-ish manner: 
open participation, the easy taking of patches, an inclusive, 
newbie-friendly contribution atmosphere, etc.)
