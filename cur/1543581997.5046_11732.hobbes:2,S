There are no problems with 2.2.x.  What motherboard you get depends on how
much you want to spend and on what type of athlon cpu you want to get.  K7-2
(classic), get the KA7 by abit.   Duron and T-bird should get KT7 or
something like that .    I'd use alan cox's latest patch. They work great.
Awesome performance. As good as linux gets.
