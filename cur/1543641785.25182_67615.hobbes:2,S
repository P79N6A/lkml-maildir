With the help of Mark Hahn I figuerd out, that the problem was the Bridge
setting, not the NIC setting.
The VT8363/8365 Bridge was blocking/slowing down the bus. 
After allowing this device to do fast back-to-back writes 
it works _much_ better, i.e. no more errors on the NIC.
If I encounter no negative effects of this setting, then I consider
this a working setup.
    Thank you very much for you help!
