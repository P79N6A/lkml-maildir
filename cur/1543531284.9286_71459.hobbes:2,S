If the XML route is chosen, it would be possible to allow multiple languages
in the description, like:

<description lang="de">

'n' : is handled by "conflicts" instead of "depends"
'm' : is handled just as dep_tristate does now
'y' : I don't know yet.

With the current Config.in system, this is NOT possible. This is, for me,
the most obvious reason something new is needed.

Well, if a dependency isn't straightforward, this would help users to get the
question visible, and when the user selects the option, he gets prompted
with the dependency issue.
But of course, the creator of the question must explicitly enable this.

"tweaks" or "rewrite"? I would guess at least a partial rewrite would be
needed, and if that is the case, I'd prefer to get it right.
