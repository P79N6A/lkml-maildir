hi all,
I have some trouble in testing a Perl module.
The "make test" gives me this problem:
t/07io..............Your vendor has not defined Socket macro MSG_PEEK,
used at blib/lib/Convert/BER.pm line 968
dubious
and I didn't find this macro defined in "sys/types.h" or in
"sys/socket.h" or in any other header.
Can anyone help me?
Does anyone know where I can find the macro MSG_PEEK?
thanks in advance
marco nardelli
