Yes I know, I read their web page, and if cross-platform compatibility
is what you want it looks a nice way to go.  They didn't publish any
performance figures (at least, not where I could find), and 
they're binary only, 
There's also the LinuxAnt stuff: 
http://www.linuxant.com
 that, for
Wireless cards at least, provides a Windows ABI for standard NDIS
drivers; and Hunt et al's work on Windows
