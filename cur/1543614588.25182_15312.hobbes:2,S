Hello!
I ran into a similar problem:
Upgraded from 2.4.5 to 2.4.14 and added some RAM (total 1GB now). When not using 
  HIHGMEM_4GB, ~180MB of the RAM was missing. With HIGHMEM_4GB enabled, sound 
was totally trashed (I also had the segfaulting Quake3Arena).
The SBLive uses the "emu10k1"-driver - and the driver that came with 2.4.14 was 
broken if used with "HIGHMEM" enabled. W/o this, the sound had no problems. Rui 
Sousa made it working with HIGMEM enabled. (But sometimes, especially with very 
little free RAM left the sound is still broken )
Have you tried the latest snapshot from opensource.creative.com ?
I've taken a look into the kernel-patches (I'm still at 2.4.14 - will upgrade to 
2.4.17 when SGI's XFS is ready for thet kernel), and there were no 
version-changes in the driver.
How to do it (very short):
Unzip and untar, cd into "emu10k1_<date>" and do "make && make install"
(maybe save the old from "/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/drivers/sound" 
and "sound/emu10k1" before...) Remove your loaded "emu10k1" and "ac97_codec" 
modules (don't forget this), load the new and test it.
There are some more nice features within Creatives "official" drivers (such as 
bass/treble control)...
ciao
Michael
