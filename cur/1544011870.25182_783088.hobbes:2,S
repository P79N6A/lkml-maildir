It's been some time now since Max K. brought up the complete processor isolation
discussion. I know his original patch was NAK'd but some work on this was put
into cpusets. I'm unclear as to what actually has been or will be implemented.
The 2 things I'm most interested in are work queues, and local timer interrupts.
Is it yet possible to isolate a processor from either of these 2 things with
recent kernels?
The kernel doc concerning cpusets doesn't seem to clarify this for me.
The Process shielding instructions at
http://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/CPU_shielding_using_/proc_and_/dev/cpuset
don't seem to help with work queues or local timer interrupts. Should they?
Thanks in advance for any pointers
Mark
