I'm trying to replace the __pte_free_tlb macros my patch touches for the
different architectures. Not much luck yet, there is a reason why
__pte_free_tlb is a macro in the first place: welcome to #include hell.
I'm starting to get grumpy as well..
Just an example for x86-64:
* asm-x86/tlb.h includes asm-generic/tlb.h
* asm-generic/tlb.h includes asm-x86/pgalloc.h
* asm-x86/pgalloc.h includes asm-x86/pgalloc_64.h
* asm-x86/pgalloc_64.h includes asm-x86/tlb.h
* since asm-x86/tlb.h started this #include chain it expands to nothing
* asm-x86/pgalloc_64.h calls tlb_remove_page which is defined in
  asm-x86/tlb.h but the compiler hasn't seen the definition yet
* you loose..
I got x86-64 compiled by removing the #include <asm/pgalloc.h> from
asm-generic/tlb.h. But who knows what will break if the include is
missing .. I'll cross compile some of the other architectures next.
