Subject: [PATCH] ACPI scan: Revert acpi_bus_find_driver() return value check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/27/40

2.6.13 introduced a change to drivers/acpi/scan.c along the lines of:
          *
          * TBD: Assumes LDM provides driver hot-plug capability.
          */
-       result = acpi_bus_find_driver(device);
+       acpi_bus_find_driver(device);
        end:
         if (!result)
This was inside this commit:
http://www.kernel.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=3fb02738b0fd36f47710a2bf207129efd2f5daa2
Since then, various HP/Compaq laptops have not been able to boot, freezing 
after these messages:
PCI: Using ACPI for IRQ routing
PCI: If a device does not work, try "pci=routeirq". If it helps, post a report
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 7 of bridge 0000:00:1c.1
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 8 of bridge 0000:00:1c.1
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 9 of bridge 0000:00:1c.1
Rajesh Shah (the author of said commit) has since then acked that this small 
change should probably be reverted:
> Looking at this closely now, checking for the result does appear
> to be wrong. Binding a driver for a device should be optional,
> and should not fail adding the device to the acpi list. I suspect
> a previous iteration through this code failed to find a driver
> match, returned failure to the caller and caused bad things to
> happen. So, your patch looks good to me.
The main diagnosis/discussion has been at:
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=116763
There are also some other reports elsewhere:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5221
http://bugs.gentoo.org/112601
So far the investigation/fixing has been done by Thomas Renninger and others. 
I'm just hoping to breathe some life into an issue which has been sitting 
around for nearly 3 months.
If acceptable, please apply.

This patch reverts the acpi_bus_find_driver() return value check which was
accidentally added in a big commit titled:
	[PATCH] acpi bridge hotadd: Allow ACPI .add and .start operations to be
	done independently
This particular change broke booting of some HP/Compaq laptops unless
acpi=noirq is used.
