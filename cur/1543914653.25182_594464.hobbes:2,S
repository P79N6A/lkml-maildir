Yes, e.g. like in

Or rather than duplicating the menu items for the same options, split
the SCSI high-level options out into a top-level menu and adjust the
wording of the prompts.  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/14/217
(top level)
menu "Storage (core and SCSI commands)"
	config SCSI
		tristate "Storage support (core and SCSI commands)"
	config BLK_DEV_SD
		tristate "Harddisks and other Direct access devices"
	config CHR_DEV_ST
		tristate "Tape drives"
	config CHR_DEV_OSST
		tristate "SCSI OnStream SC-x0 tape support"
	config BLK_DEV_SR
		tristate "CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs"
	...
menu "Device Drivers"
	...
	menu "SCSI device support"
		config RAID_ATTRS
		config SCSI_TGT
		menu "SCSI Transports"
			...
		menuconfig SCSI_LOWLEVEL
			bool "SCSI low-level drivers"
			...
