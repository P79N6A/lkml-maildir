Well, I'm happy with using jiffies as the backport fix for softlockup
(if sched_clock is indeed a problem there), but mainly because it won't
affect Xen.  I don't know what effect it will have on vmi though.
cpu_clock seems like a good approach for .23 onwards.  I guess I should
test it at some point...
