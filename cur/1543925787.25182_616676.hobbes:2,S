Yes I agree.  People not using Patrick's new API deserves to
get poor performance so they can switch over sooner :)
What I was trying to say above is that e1000 currently uses
the old set_multicast_list interface (rather than dev_set_rx_mode)
so it's not immediately obvious why we're in promiscuous mode.
We could look at dev->promiscuity - !!uc_count but that feels a
bit fragile.
Perhaps those who want to push this patch should be encouraged
to convert e1000 to the new interface :)
Cheers,
