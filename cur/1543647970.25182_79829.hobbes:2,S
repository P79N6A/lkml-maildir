Try the following instead:
// file shade1.cpp
// excerpt from common.h
#define current get_current()
// my stuff
struct {
  int any;
  int current[1000];
} mine;
// file shade2.cpp
#include <stdio.h>
// my stuff
extern struct {
  int any;
  int current[1000];
} mine;
int main () {
  mine.current[999] = 1;
  printf ("%d\n", mine.current[999]);
}
g++ shade1.cpp shade2.cpp
./a.out => segmentation fault
