Hi,
While fixing some "deprecated" issues in the OSS drivers, I wondered whether 
this makes sense, as entire OSS is marked deprecated. Will OSS make it until 
2.7, or will it be dropped soon ? (In other words, should I take care of the 
OSS drivers or not bother about them)
Best regards,
Jos Hulzink
