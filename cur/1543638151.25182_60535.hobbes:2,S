Please.  It's ~6 lines of loop.  And if somebody can't write a "parser"
of such kind correctly, I really don't like the idea of having his
code in the kernel - failing C101 doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
And I don't see what's the problem on the boot side - finding first entry
with name that starts with (say it) '*', skipping to next space and
converting the following digits into a number...  <shrug>
