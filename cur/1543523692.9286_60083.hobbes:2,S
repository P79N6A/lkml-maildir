No. Segment overrides work with string _load_ instructions, and that's
documented. They do not work with string _store_ instructions:
Pentium Processor Family Developoer's Manual, Volume 3, Chapter 4.6.2
[STRING OPERATIONS]
<<<<<<<<
The ESI register points to source operands. By default, the ESI register
is used with the DS segment register. A segment-override prefix allows
the ESI register to be used with the CS, SS, ES, FS or GS segment
registers. The EDI register points to destination operands. It uses the
segment indicated by the ES segment register; no segment override is
allowed.
