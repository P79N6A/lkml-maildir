I have two systems exhibiting a similar problem, even after swapping out
hard drives. Both systems have Intel ICH8 controllers. One is a server
class board with a Xeon, the other is a desktop class board with a Core
Duo. Both are Intel brand boards.
The server box is unable to use a drive in it's 4th, 5th or 6th SATA
port. The drive appears fine, and works fine for a few minutes, but
eventually starts spitting out errors:

I have tried three drives in these ports. Ports 1, 2 and 3 all work
perfectly. Also have switched cables and such, including exchanging a
known working cable from port #1 with port#4, etc.
The desktop board I have has similar but slightly different issues.

The difference is that ports 1, 2, 3 and 4 work fine. It's just port 5
that has an issue. I have yet to try port 6. There is a DVD drive on it
which seems to work fine.
Now, my first thought was maybe my power-supply couldn't power all the
drives. Figured if I just reorganized the plugs, maybe I could cause a
different drive to starve... but nope. It's consistently the same SATA
ports. If it was a power problem, I would not expect it to stay
localized to the same SATA ports.
The server machine is running Ubuntu Feisty with kernel
2.6.20-15-generic. The desktop machine is running Gutsy with kernel
2.6.22-10-generic.
The driver errors aren't yet good enough for me to make a diagnosis.
