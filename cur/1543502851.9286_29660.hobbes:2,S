Well thats not quite the answer I was looking for.
Let me rephrase it.
Which is the best controller, e.g. which one is the most
efficient/fastest/cleanest design?
Are there any hardware flaws in any of the SiS/HPT/PDC controllers that we
should be aware of when making a purchase decision?
E.g. VIA VP3/MVP3 have the udma cdrom flaw. What flaws are in the
SiS/HPT/PDC controllers, if any?
