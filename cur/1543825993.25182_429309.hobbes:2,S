Okay maybe matroxfb, but if atyfb is the mach64, it really isn't as
good, the last few times I tried it, it just made my LCD bloom, X
worked, mach64 is probably the most complex thing as there must be at
least 15 variations on the theme.... mach64 isn't a chip family so
much as a chip tribe... I've since burned my mach64 as a sacrifice....
