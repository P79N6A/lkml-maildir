Right. I'm puzzled here.
How safe does Martin think people will suppose the patches are if they were
not meant to be reviewed in the standard lkml manner? Given the problems
with 2.5.25 (and 'problems' would be an euphemism here) I'd expect to see
something like a 'safer coding' approach, not 'stealth operations.'
