The NFS close-to-open cache consistency requirement forces them to
compare the attribute cache to the server every time someone does a
call to open(). This is true whether or not one uses cachefs.
After the file has actually been opened, you can call fstat() as many
times as you like. The cached attributes to be used, and they will
then be checked on the server only after the cache times out.
