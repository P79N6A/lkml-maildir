Old kernels are a transition problem, security concicious people won't have
them around anyway. Moot point.

It is ugly as hell, and limits the kind of executables you can make
capable. It also keeps a "special user". That isn't possible under a pure
capability system, so this is at most a bridging solution, i.e., it doesn't
solve the problem, just papers over it.

Sure. Just put capabilities into the new filesystem. True, painful as the
a.out --> ELF transition, but if this is the right way of doing it, do it:
It's the Linux tradition, after all. Nobody says you can't fix the
capabilities before rebooting into the new, secure kernel for good.
