Well, you should have ran my little test case...
No really :-)
All your explanations make sense.
When I re-read the code in scm.c, I had trouble figuring out why it
did not work before my patch and why it worked after...
Here it is:
	int fdmax = (msg->msg_controllen - sizeof(struct cmsghdr))/sizeof(int);
But, msg->msg_controllen is of type __kernel_size_t, which is unsigned
int (on i386).
Which means that if msg_controllen < sizeof(struct cmsghdr), then
fdmax is somewhere around 0x40000000, courtesy of the int->unsigned
int C promotion...
Ooops...
Yes I agree, mixing signed and unsigned arithmetic is evil... Doesn't
gcc have a flag for unsafe signed/unsigned mixtures ?
Would you consider this patch (or a variant) for inclusion ?
Phil.
