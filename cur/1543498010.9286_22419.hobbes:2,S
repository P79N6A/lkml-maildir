I'm not sure this is relevant, but please ensure that there's a way for
mount() to turn off such symlink caching.  It's useful for my user-level
hlfsd to turn off symlink caching, esp. over nfs.  (Hlfsd creates a symlink
that points to different places depending on the euid accessing the symlink;
it's used to redirect /var/mail to users' home dirs.)
When symlink caching first showed up in solaris/sgi, they really messed up
hlfsd, until there was a way to turn it off.  Some bsd44 derivatives still
have problems w/ turning off symlink caches that hlfsd cannot work on them.
Erez.
