Subject: PTRACE_KILL doesn't (2.5.44 and others)

If the process being ptraced is running, PTRACE_KILL will have no
effect. I've seen this in 2.5.44, and the code in 2.4.18 and 2.5.66
seems to be equivalent.
According to the ptrace(2) man page (as of man-pages-1.56),
PTRACE_KILL doesn't require the process to be stopped for this to
work.
Who is right ?
