Martin,
1.  Adaptec SCSI driver on a 4 x P6 POCA blows up with timeout errors
then hard hangs machine.
2.  DVD-RAM drive gets scsi timeout errors on AMD K6 System.
3.  Cannot see the MASHITA RW-CDROM with ide-scsi loaded with patch.
4.  2.4.0 hard locks on dual processor PIII 400Mhz during kernel boot.
:-)
Well, I tried the patch.  Looks like some SMP issues of some kind.  
Jeff
