It's not a gcc problem, but a general dislike of non-native integer
formats by the kernel developers. Personally, I've nothing against it
at all, but I've seen several patches rejected simply because they
used long long on 32-bit platforms.

Remember that libc can't be used in the kernel itself...
Best wishes from Riley.
