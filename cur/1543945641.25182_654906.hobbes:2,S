The following is a series of patchsets related to Unionfs.  The most
significant changes are several fixes to races/locking.  This release also
supports newer APIs in 2.6.25-rc: not using iget/read_inode, using the
changed d_path, using the revised nameidata which embeds a struct path, and
using path_get/put.
These patches were tested (where appropriate) on 2.6.25, MM, as well as the
backports to 2.6.{24,23,22,21,20,19,18,9} on ext2/3/4, xfs, reiserfs,
nfs2/3/4, jffs2, ramfs, tmpfs, cramfs, and squashfs (where available).  Also
tested with LTP-full and with a continuous parallel kernel compile (while
forcing cache flushing, manipulating lower branches, etc.).  See
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/
 to download back-ported unionfs code.
