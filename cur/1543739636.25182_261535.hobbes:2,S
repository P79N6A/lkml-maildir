there's new generic mutex code in -U5 which covers all the locking
primitives: semaphores, rw-semaphores, spinlock-mutexes and
rwlock-mutexes. PI should be done by improving the existing
rwsem-generic.c code.

with preemption disabled and there we currently dump a trace of all 
critical sections held - this should be enough to pinpoint the bug.
