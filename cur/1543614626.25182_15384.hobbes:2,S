Sounds like a good idea; I'll give it a shot over the next few days, unless 
someone already has one :)

I'd add one level of abstraction: have each filename map to a "module" name. 
In this case, each filename relating to devfs would map to module "devfs"; 
there would then be an entry mapping devfs <-> Richard.
(Perhaps a hierarchy - fs.devfs - with people like Al listed for "fs"?)

It should be a little easier having a mapping to a module - in most cases, 
there's a clear "module" to which each file belongs. Then just track who's 
"subscribed to" that module...
