Hi Andrew!
Thanks!
Indeed udev update solved my problem with "preparing system to use udev"
hang. It now works like a charm. I had 030 version too.
Only the "mounting filesystem" hangs persists :(
May it have something about I have reiserfs 3.6 as my main filesystem?
I think it may be some type of configuration or update too.
Thank you very much.
