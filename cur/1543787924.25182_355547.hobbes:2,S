That would be best, yes.

Of the include files already included directly by arch/ia64/kernel/setup.c,
<linux/sched.h> looks the most promising.  There's lots of .*idle.* things
already in there.
Looking at existing precedent: ppc64 has a definition of default_idle()
in <asm/machdep.h>
i396, cris and um already have gone along the route of adding extern
definitions for default_idle() to ".c" files ... so cleanup creates more
opportunities for cleanup (but you are probably very experienced in
this phenomenom :-)
