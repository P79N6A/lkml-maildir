Your patch looks a lot cleaner and less hackish than mine.  But I wonder 
if it still works with kernels that support the sysenter method of 
calling into the kernel.  Look at the following code:
ENTRY(sysenter_entry)
        movl TSS_sysenter_esp0(%esp),%esp
sysenter_past_esp:
        STI
        pushl $(__USER_DS)
        pushl %ebp
        pushfl
        pushl $(__USER_CS)
        pushl $SYSENTER_RETURN
SYSENTER_RETURN is a link time constant that is defined based on the 
location of the vsyscall page.  If the vsyscall page can move, this can 
not be a constant.  The reason is, this "fake" exception frame is used 
to return back to the EIP of the call site, and sysenter does not record 
the EIP of the call site.
