I'd rather have them in the same source-file, but not spread around in the
file. It's nice to see _what_ a file exports, without having to grep for
them.
HOWEVER, putting them in many different source-files makes compilation
slower, so I personally avoid that unless one source-file is clearly
important enough to do so. For core functionality where we clearly export
the functions to the rest of the kernel through a header file anyway, we
might as well keep the EXPORT_SYMBOL's central, and speed up kernel
builds that way.

No. Check the speed of "make dep" with every single file exporting
objects. Not pretty.
