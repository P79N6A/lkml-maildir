An interesting and simple approach indeed; but spreading an instance across
multiple nodes is nowhere as simple as it seems; where do you keep OS data, IO
access, scheduling decisions, inter-node communication in the first place, how
to deal with node failure etc...
However, I believe it could potentially be implemented cleaner than currently
with the Compaq SSI stuff, because the encapsulation is better etc; but I have
been known to be wrong ;-)
It would certainly be very interesting. If you _really_ want to open this can
of worms, you should consider joining linux-cluster mailing list for this, or
the Open Clustering Framework list (because you are going to stumble into the
madness which is "interoperability and lack of standards" here).
Sincerely,
