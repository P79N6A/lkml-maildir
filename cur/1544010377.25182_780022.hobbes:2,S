Do you mean, keeping the CONFIG_UNEVICTABLE_LRU codepath even
when CONFIG_SWAP=n is a good idea?  Or do you see a reason we
actually still need CONFIG_UNEVICTABLE_LRU as an option?
It does add about 2.6k to kernel text (YMMV), is saving that
worth the extra config option?  For others to vote, really.
