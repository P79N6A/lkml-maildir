Lets put the threads stuff in the stub.  The only stuff we need in the kernel is 
the flag that indicateds that the pid hash table has been initialized.
Meanwhile, I would like to make a change to the gdb "info thread" command to do 
a better job of displaying the threads.  Here is what I am proposing:
Gdb would work as it does now if the following set is not done.
A new "set thread_level" command that would take the "bt" level to use on the 
thread display.
A new "set thread_limits command that would take two expressions that would 
reduce to two memory addresses.
Which ever of these is entered last will be active and used by "info thread" as 
follows:
if thread_level is active gdb will do the indicated number of  "up" operations 
and display the result on the info thread line for that thread (note there is 
other info on this line that will not be changed).
if thread_limits is active gdb will do 0 or more "up" commands until the 
resultant PC is NOT between the given limits.
The kernel, at this time, has defined symbols for the thread_limits command (it 
is used in the kernel for its internal display of threads).  I would expect that 
the thread_level version would be the answer for theaded application programs.
Daniel, how does this sound?
