One slightly annoying thing is that monotone doesn't appear to have a
web interface.  I used to use the bk one a lot when tracking down
bugs, because it was really fast to have a web browser window open and
click through the revisions of a file reading checkin comments, etc.
Does anyone know if one is being worked on?
bazaar-ng at least mention this is important in their design docs and
arch has one in development too.
