Subject: [BUG ?] smbfs open always succeeds

Hello,
I posted a possible bug report to the maintainer about 10 days ago but 
with no response, therefore here it goes again. As far a I can tell it is 
common for both 2.4 and 2.6.
Sorry if this is not a bug but some hidden functionality!
--- snippet from the original mail to the maintainer ---
Looking at linux-2.6.9/fs/smbfs/file.c line 365 (end of the smb_file_open 
function). Shouldn't it be "return result;" instead of "return 0;" ?
I've been tracing some strange behaviour and this fixed it for me. But I 
am far away from being an expert. :)
