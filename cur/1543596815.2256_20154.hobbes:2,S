Ok, perhaps I mis-spoke slightly.  What the spec does state is that the
cookie is opaque.  This has generally been interpreted to mean that you
should not trust it to be stable after a change to that directory.

If I were to do a create during a readdir() operation which inserted
itself in the directory before the place it left off, that entry would be
left out of the listing.  That is also a bug, wouldn't you think?
I'd also like to point out that every other operating system which I have
tested this with has resulted in the correct behavior (NetBSD, FreeBSD,
Digital Unix, ...)
As for the refresh vs. invalidate problem, I would be happy to add
another time stamp to the in-core nfs inode exclusively for directory
invalidation.
