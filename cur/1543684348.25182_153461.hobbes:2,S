I have some doubts regarding cpufreq for SMP systems (for developing 
http://mnm.uib.es/~gallir/cpudyn/
).
If I remember well, I read a while ago that cpufreq didn't work in SMP 
systems, but reading the docs and kernel/cpufreq.c, it seems there should be 
any problem? 
Is it true?
OTH, I trying it on a P4 HT, and it works, changes in the frequency of one of 
the "cpu's",  changes both. 
What happens in the case of several real cpu's? Does it keep the same 
frequency for every cpu? According to a comment in cpufreq.c, it seems that 
each cpu might have different frequencies.
So, what's recommended? Change the frequency of every cpu one by one?
Thanks,
PS: sorry, I don't have any cpufreq/SMP machine at hand.
