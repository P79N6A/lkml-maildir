This is a very serious problem which I have also encountered. My
strategy was to make the readers on the tasklist_lock more well-behaved,
and with Ingo's help and co-authorship those changes were cleaned up,
tuned to provide performance benefits for smaller systems, bugfixed,
and incorporated in the kernel. They have at least provided 16x systems
in my lab with much more stability. The issues are still triggerable on
32x systems in my lab, to which I do not have regular access.
Rusty, Dave, Ingo, and Linus cc:'d for additional commentary/help.
