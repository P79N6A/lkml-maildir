Robert, the PCI patches for fixing up MCFG detection/usage and probing 
should go through Greg.  Can you resend so we don't miss 2.6.24 this 
time?  (I was really hoping this stuff would get into 2.6.23, but 
apparently none of the right people were Cc'd at the right time... 
damn.)
You can add my sign-off to this one too.
Thanks,
Jesse
