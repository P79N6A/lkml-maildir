sorry, but this way of reading makes no sense!  in your reading it would
be perfectly fine if select would return immediately, and it would be wrong 
if returning some usec after timeout.  
and if you directly consider the need of delays/sleeps, upper bounds make 
no sense and you can't guarantee them -- but sleeping _at_least_ some 
period of time is perfectly reasonable and it's just implemented this way.
select either waits until the status changes, _or_ it will time out.
`timeout' is an upper bound how long to _wait_ before timing out and returning.
but select obviously can't guarantee that it will return before `timeout'
is over.
