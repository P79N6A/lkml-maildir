I did just remove all of the previous dependancies and place them on the
zImage target (we don't mention that you can do 'make
arch/ppc/boot/images/foo.image, and I don't know if that would work, so
I don't think that'd be a problem).

IIRC, changing to $< means we have to compilcate the rules a bit more,
or thinking a bit harder, re-arrange the dependancies s.t.
$(obj)/image*.o is first, and gen-chrp (and gen-pmac) both know to use
$(CHRPOBJS) and $(LIBS).
