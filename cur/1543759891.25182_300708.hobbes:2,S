I wonder how could anyone use S4BIOS in 2.6.11. S4 and S4b all came into
'enter_state'. and in acpi_sleep_init:
		if (i == ACPI_STATE_S4) {
			if (acpi_gbl_FACS->S4bios_f) {
				sleep_states[i] = 1;
				printk(" S4bios");
				acpi_pm_ops.pm_disk_mode =
PM_DISK_FIRMWARE;
			}
			if (sleep_states[i])
				acpi_pm_ops.pm_disk_mode =
PM_DISK_PLATFORM;
		}
That means we actually can't set PM_DISK_FIRMWARE (always set
PM_DISK_PLATFORM). Is this intended? If no, .pm_disk_mode should be a
mask.
Thanks,
Shaohua
