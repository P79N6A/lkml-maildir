0.8 is easy on single core today.
multicore just increases how idle you can be for a given core.

this is not correct; many machines are idle waiting for network data. Think of webservers...

how about something else instead: a timer mechanism that takes a range instead..
that at least has defined semantics; the deferrable semantics really are "indefinite".
Lets keep at least the semantics clear and clean.
