I have some further info here.
I performed strace on ifup -a and ifdown -a.
They aren't more than 4Kb each, but I'll cut and paste what appear to be
most relevant:
ifup.strace:
fork()                                  = 17974
wait4(17974, [WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 0], 0, NULL) = 17974
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
fork()                                  = 17976
wait4(17976, SIOCSIFADDR: Bad file descriptor
lo: unknown interface: Bad file descriptor
lo: unknown interface: Bad file descriptor
[WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 255], 0, NULL) = 17976
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
ifdown.strace:
munmap(0x40018000, 4096)                = 0
fork()                                  = 17989
wait4(17989, [WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 0], 0, NULL) = 17989
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
fork()                                  = 17991
wait4(17991, lo: unknown interface: Bad file descriptor
[WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 255], 0, NULL) = 17991
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
I think a better question would be, does anyone here have any ideas
where I might look to correcting this? Since it did not occur with same
tools under 2.2.18pre24, should I assume the kernel is at fault and look
there? Or maybe the eepro module code? I notice quite a bit of
discussion concerning this driver, but all (?) relating to 2.4.x
Can anyone point a finger?
Thanks
