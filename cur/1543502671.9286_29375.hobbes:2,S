Me and Emanuel Pirker now are busy merging his Adaptec driver into my
subsystem, he is also developing a user space (raw) interface.  At
least on my Lynx driver transactions are working, things like timeouts
and transaction aborts (during bus resets) still have to be sorted out
(this weekend probably).
Isochronous transfers are not yet implemented.  An OHCI driver will be
written when the current stuff is working.
