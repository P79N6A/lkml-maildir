we can disable preemption in the PREEMPT_RT kernel too, but only for
code we know the maximum execution length of. I.e. we dont want want to
disable preemption while processing the callback _list_, but we can use
preemption-off to protect the per-cpu data structures.

correct, assuming that the pointer you get to the per-CPU data is truly
pointing to the current CPU's data. (i.e. the current->rcu_data pointer
approach breaks this assumption.)
