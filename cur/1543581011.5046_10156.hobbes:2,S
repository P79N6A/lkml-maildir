I own a Iwill KA266 which uses the ALi M1647 northbridge and M1535D+ 
south.  I'm getting errors on startup and thought I should see if this 
is an issue with the set or kernel 2.4.1
First, during the ALI15X3 starup I get:
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:04.0.  Please try 
pci=biosirq
according to /proc/pci,00:04.0 is an ALi M5229 IDE (rev 196).
Second, for agpgart I have to use try_agp_unsupported=1 which gets me
agpgart: Trying generic Ali routines for device id: 1647
according to my nvidia driver proc entry, agp is not enabled.
Is there more information I should provide?
Thanks
Dave Pyke
