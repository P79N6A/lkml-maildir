Well, as a kernel developer, I am both :) For me, having to install
half-a-dozen different command line tools to get and analyze a crash dump
is a PITA, not to mention potential version mismatches. As someone
who would like very much to use crash dump for debugging, I would
much rather be able to force a dump and then use gdb for
a quick debug. I agree that a customer would see a different
situation. It would be nice if we can cater to both the kinds.
Thanks
