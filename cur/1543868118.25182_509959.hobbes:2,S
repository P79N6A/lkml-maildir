Hmm, readcd was trying to read 279884 blocks, while cdrecord said it
wrote 279882 blocks.

There always seems to have been any issue with reading blocks from a cd
getting broken by the kernel doing readahead and getting failures by
trying to read past the end of the disc even though the user never asked
it to.  Sometimes your size just happens to hit a safe block size so the
readahead doesn't break.

Well it seems some disks can be read that way, others can not.

Well that makes some sense.  I always though testing a distribution
meant installing it and using it a bit, andif it wasn't right, you
installed the next one.  I have never had more than one installed at a
time myself.
