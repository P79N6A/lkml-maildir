It's really easy for cracker to patch sys_call even if it the table is not
exported. Not exporting the sys call table is just to encourage good
programming technics not a protection against machiavel things.

As stated oprofile needs it, there is no other efficient way to track exec,
mmap and other sys call needed for profiler. I hope a consensus can
be reach : explain than unloading module wich patch the sys call table
are unsafe on SMP, discourage the use of sys call table patch, but do
not forbid that.
