 thats why I said "maybe" :-) Sure, another 5% of cache may improve
things, but they also may kill the interactive performance. Thats why
there should be probably more than one VM strategy to accomodate Servers
and Workstations/Lpatops.

 And that is the problem. To much seems to go into swap. At least for
interactive work. Unfortunatelly, with 128MB of memory I cannot entirely
turn of swap. I will see how things are going once I have 256 or 512 MB
(hopefully soon :-)

 Do not take the 70% as an arbitrary limit. I never said that. The 70%
is just my situation. The problems may arise at 60% cache or at 97.38%
cache.

 Absolutely true. And if the main purpose of the machine is interactive
work (we do want to be Linux a success on the desktop, don't we?), it
should not be hampered by by an IO improvement that may be only of
secondary importance to the user (that the final "customer" for all the
work that is done to the kernel :-). On big servers a litle paging now
and then may be absolutely OK, as long as the IO is going strong.
 I am observing the the discussions of VM behaviour in 2.4.x for some
time. They are mostly very entertaining and revealing. But they also
show that one solution does not seem to benefit all possible scenarios.
Therfore either more than one VM strategy is necessary, or better means
of tuning the cache behaviour, or both. Definitely better ways of
measuring the VM efficiency seem to be needed.
 While implementing VM strategies is probably out of question for a lot
of the people that complain, I hope that at least my complaints are kind
of useful.
