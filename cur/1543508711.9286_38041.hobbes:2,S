   I've reviewed your patch, and "ported" it to fit into linux-2.2.x. Was
   it your intention to get the patches into 2.2.x? It sure looks as if
   it was "designed" with that in mind. Or do you want it to get some
   testing in 2.3.x first?
Sorry Rogier for not getting back to you sooner; I've been travelling en
route to Germany for the Linux Kongress and the Storage and Filesystem
Workshop in Darmstadt (where I'm currently sending this message courtesy
of Deutch Telecom --- hopefully, if I can figure out how to get through
their !@#! firewall.....)
Yes, the serial driver was designed to work for both Linux 2.3 and Linux
2.2.  I ship the serial driver in a stand-alone package where you can
compile it as a module separately from the kernel tree, and that was the
original way that I had assumed people with 2.2 kernels could use the
new serial driver.  But yes, it can be put into the 2.2 kernel without
much difficulty.  
There've been a few bug fixes and plus updates for new PCI board to
support, so I do want to get some additional changes before I ask for
something to be merged into the 2.2 kernel.
   Do you want me to help out on some of the declare-mutex macros? (i.e. 
   make the main code read without any ifdefs.) 
I've already done that in my sources....
