	linux-2.5.2-pre11/drivers/block/loop.c returned incorrect data
for reads from any loop device that was mounted on a block device,
such as a disk partition.  The bug is the problem that I asked about
yesterday where do_bio_blockbacked in loop.c would transfer no data
because bio->bi_idx was nonzero (or, more precisely, always equal to
bio->bi_vcnt).  Here is a test case that reproduces the problem:
#!/bin/sh
# testdev can be any existant device that has a first sector
# that is not all zeroes.  We only need read access to it for this test.
testdev=/dev/discs/disc0/part1
set -e
dd count=1 if=$testdev of=/tmp/first_sector
losetup /dev/loop/0 $testdev
dd count=1 if=/dev/loop/0 of=/tmp/first_sector.loop
losetup -d /dev/loop/0
cmp /tmp/first_sector /tmp/first_sector.loop
	It turns out that the value of bio->bi_idx is correct.
The "bio" variable in that routine refers to the I/O operation
on the underlying device (not the loop device), and the I/O
operation has completed when do_bio_blockbacked has been
called for a READ.  do_bio_blockbacked should be looking at
rbh->bi_idx instead (rbh is the operation on /dev/loop/nnn,
which has not yet completed).  I have attached a patch below
which does this, and I have verified that it fixes the test
case and have used it in mounting a filesystem as well.
	By the way, there are plenty of other problems with
loop.c, such as the fact that it hangs my note book computer
in "disk I/O" (presumably to /dev/loop/0) every time it boots,
whereas I don't think I've seen that happen at all under 2.5.1-pre1
(although I have generally seen hangs about once every three weeks
since I went to an encrypted root).
