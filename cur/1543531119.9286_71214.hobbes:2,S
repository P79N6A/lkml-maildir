Lets talk about audio interfaces too. With a 1.5ms fragment size, we
potentially have a SCHED_FIFO task that wants to get running again 13
times per timer interrupt. If the task only does a few 100usec of work
when it wakes up (not uncommon) and then goes back to sleep, the
window here is big, if I understand Alan's use of the term.
Ditto for a task using the async I/O capabilities of the RTC driver,
and a moderate-to-high interrupt frequency from the RTC.
Ditto for a task waiting for data from a MIDI interface, woken during
the interrupt handler for the device.
Basically, ditto for any situation where a task sleeps on the
condition of an external device/interface, wants to respond in a soft
real time fashion to the change, and rarely, if ever, is still
runnable before the next such interrupt shows up. This is true for a
lot of audio apps.
