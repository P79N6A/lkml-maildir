Hi, 
here's an updated patch of Gerd Knorr's x11-fb patch, taken from here: 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/work/current/2.6/2.6.16/patches/x11-fb
It compiles on 2.6.16 and works at least a little bit. I get some
initial output, see the screenshot here:
http://www.pengutronix.de/uml-x11.gif
However, the window is never redrawn and I didn't manage to make input
working, but it may be a start for others. It was a little bit messy to
find the right kconfig switches which had to be enabled, because the
uml's kconfig structure is very different from the mainstream one. 
Gerd, are you still actively working on this driver?
Robert
