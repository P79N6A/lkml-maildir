they're already in under the name of mempools
I'm perfectly aware the fs tends to be the less correct places in terms
of allocations, and luckily it's not an heavy memory user, so I still
have to see a deadlock in getblk or create_buffers or similar. It's
mostly a correctness issue (math proof it can't deadlock, right now it
can if more tasks all get stuck in getblk at the same time during a hard
oom condition etc..).
