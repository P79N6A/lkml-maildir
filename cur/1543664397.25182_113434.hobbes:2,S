 From these numbers, UDP has 18%-44% higher latency than AF_UNIX, with 
the difference going up as the machine speed goes up.
Aside from that, IP multicast doesn't seem to work properly.  I enabled 
multicast on lo and disabled it on eth0, and a ping to 224.0.0.1 still 
got responses from all the multicast-capable hosts on the network.  From 
userspace, multicast unix would be *simple* to use, as in totally 
transparent.
The other reason why I would like to see this happen is that it just 
makes *sense*, at least to me.  We've got multicast IP, so multicast 
unix for local machine access is a logical extension in my books.
Do we agree at least that some form of multicast is the logical solution 
to the case of one sender/many listeners?
Thanks for your thoughts,
Chris
