Subject: [PATCH] Serial: proper support for Exar 16L580/16L2550/16L2552/16V2550/16V2552 UARTs

Hi Russel,
In the last couple of years, Exar Corporation has introduced new UART 
products, with additional features:
16L580 - 16 Byte FIFO with EFR
16L2550/52/ & 16V2550/52 - 16 Byte FIFO with EFR (2 channel UARTs)
All these devices have uniquw device ids.
16L580 has Device ID =  0x01; Both 16L2550/52 and 16V2550/52 has Device 
IDs = 0x02
Due to existing logic in the serial driver's 8250.c, the above products 
default to 16650V2 UART type (32 byte FIFO UART), causing some potential 
problems. In this regard, please verify this patch, which fixes those 
issues.
