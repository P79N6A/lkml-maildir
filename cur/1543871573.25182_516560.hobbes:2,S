btw I consider it an information leak that any user can see which
files/libraries any other user and root has mmap'd. (and with glibc's
stdio mmap feature that goes even beyond direct mmap to fopen()'d).
If root or some other user wants to watch
hillary-vs-obama-in-the-mud.avi, no other user has ANY business even
seeing that. So at minimum it's a privacy issue showing the filenames...
