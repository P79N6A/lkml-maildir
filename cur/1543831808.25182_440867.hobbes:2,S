We actually didn't talk about where we should put fingerprint devices.
I understand that fingerprint devices can perfectly fit in userspace,
and maybe that's the best place to put them.

So in this case, instead of having an unique interface to retrieve and
use fingerprint readers on the kernel space, we should have it on
userspace ? Entirely ? This will then bind fingerprint applications to
always use some kind of userspace library or daemon. If we are to have
a centralized system to manage that (which we don't have right now),
and in both situations we're going to need to implement it (either at
kernel level or as some kind of userspace library set and/or a running
daemon that uses it), I think that it will be better to bind future
fingerprint applications to the kernel instead of userspace libraries.
What will happen then if we want to combine fingerprint matching in a
situation where the userspace isn't available ? Let's say, use a
fingerprint validation to mount / (I now that this implies having a
fingerprint match algorithm implemented in kernel, which is out of
scope).
If we are to have all the fingerprint readers interfaces in usermode,
how will this be done ?
Let's take in consideration the number of currently available usermode
drivers for fingerprint readers: if we are to have a centralized
interface to manage all the different types of fingerprint readers, we
need to keep this somewhere (a daemon or library providing an API to
access the devices in an uniform way). In both cases, an effort is
involved in porting the currently available SDKs to this API in order
to get it working. What about the closed-source SDKs ?
My point is: if we're going to implement a centralized interface for
this, and fingerprint applications are to be bound to an API, this API
should be at the kernel, where there are less chances of each vendor
having their own API (as it is now in userspace), and less libraries
or daemons competing between them to be "the default standard for
fingerprint devices" in linux.

I'm currently talking about something much less ambitious... at least
started like that. Just having a way to tell the userspace the
capabilities of our fingerprint reader hardware (image resolution,
image format, etc). In a uniform way (so doesn't matter which reader
do you have, you can have this information). Them came the idea of
putting it on sysfs (since this is already done with sound system,
net, etc). Then came the idea of extending it to all devices and
BUSes, not just USB fingerprint (which got off-topic). If you see my
previous messages about this, the proposed system was just an extra
void structure pointer that would point to a device-class-based
structure holding the properties (even though this was fixed for USB
devices only).

As I said before, the kernel _may_ need to access the device (used
together with cryptography, as an example). It's the only case that I
can actually think of, and may not be enough to move fingerprint
readers entirely to kernel mode...

For scanners, I think that it's ok to be entirely in userspace, since
I don't see any use of scanners in kernel mode.

Actually they are, since I'm referring to the userspace SDK that they
provide, which access the /dev/usb* stuff directly to talk directly
with the fingerprint readers. Are there independent developers
developing userspace drivers for fingerprint readers on linux (i.e.,
aren't tied to any vendor) ?
Thanks
