BTW this is how my flush_kernel_map looks like:
static void flush_kernel_map(void *arg)
{
        struct flush_arg *a = (struct flush_arg *)arg;
        struct page *pg;
        unsigned int xx = 0;
        /* When clflush is available use it because it is
           much cheaper than WBINVD. */
        printk("%s: 1\n", __func__);
        if (a->full_flush || !cpu_has_clflush)
                asm volatile("wbinvd" ::: "memory");
        else list_for_each_entry(pg, &a->l, lru) {
        printk("%s: %10u 1a\n", __func__, xx++);
                if (PageFlush(pg))
                        clflush_cache_range(page_address(pg), PAGE_SIZE);
        }
        printk("%s: 2\n", __func__);
        __flush_tlb_all();
        printk("%s: 3\n", __func__);
}
It outputs 1a in the infinite loop with incrementing xx. But only in this case,
some global_flush_tlb are OK. e.g.:
Sep 10 01:39:19 localhost kernel: agpgart: Detected an Intel G33 Chipset.
Sep 10 01:39:19 localhost kernel: global_flush_tlb: 1

It seems, that the list is broken only on X shutdown. How can be deferred-pages
list inited in some bad manner, when list_replace_init is called on it? Weird.
