Hello all.
Does the P4 didn't have thermal acpi monitor? As pointed by some 
gdesklets monitors, i've enabled acpi + thermal modules, but cannot read 
values (no such file in /proc/acpi/thermal_zone). In AMD Athlon 2.8+ i 
can monitor its value.
Am i missing something?
Asus p4p800-d, p4 2.4c ht enabled, 2.6.0-test11.
Also, please point me to some other useful docs in this area.
dmesg output:
# modprobe acpi
# modprobe thermal
ACPI: Processor [CPU1] (supports C1)
ACPI: Processor [CPU2] (supports C1)
Please c/c me as i'm not subscribed. Thanks in advance.
