	   Sorry, I've misparsed it ;-< What I was thinking of is
   NO_UNLINK stuff - behaves as APPEND_ONLY and IMMUTABLE wrt link
   creation/removing and gives no protection to the contents of file.
   It is useful in many situations and it *is* easy to implement.
   But yes, UNRM is different... Actually I'ld propose to take one more bit
   of attributes for that. UFS has such thing (ignored in Linux) and VFS
   support for that would be very easy to add (I already did VFS part and
   changes to UFS driver). Could you comment on that? All I need on ext2 side
   is a spare bit in ext2_i.i_flags (user-visible).
I guess I'm little confused about how NO_UNLINK would be useful.  Does
it protect against file renames as well as unlinks?  What about
truncates?  If it doesn't protect the data, what are the applications
where it's useful?
