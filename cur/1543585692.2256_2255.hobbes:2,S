Hmm, interesting.  Even with my modification - which means that
vm_enough_memory() will always return false if the allocation would clobber
freepages.min - I can still trigger OOM quite easily.  Even with no swap on
my box, there's a lot of disk activity, probably due to there being
virtually no disk cache left - could the generation of disk buffer and
cache pages be bypassing vm_enough_memory()?  If so, would using
freepages.low as the threshold rather than freepages.min help at all? (or
have I got everything muddled...)
