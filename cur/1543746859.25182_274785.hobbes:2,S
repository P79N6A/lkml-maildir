Q: I do not understand why you have such strong objections to idea of
selective suspend.
A: Do selective suspend during runtime power managment, that's
okay. But
its useless for suspend-to-disk. (And I do not see how you could use
it for suspend-to-ram, I hope you do not want that).
Lets see, so you suggest to
* SUSPEND all but swap device and parents
* Snapshot
* Write image to disk
* SUSPEND swap device and parents
* Powerdown
Oh no, that does not work, if swap device or its parents uses DMA,
you've corrupted data. You'd have to do
* SUSPEND all but swap device and parents
* FREEZE swap device and parents
* Snapshot
* UNFREEZE swap device and parents
* Write
* SUSPEND swap device and parents
Which means that you still need that FREEZE state, and you get more
complicated code. (And I have not yet introduce details like system
devices).
