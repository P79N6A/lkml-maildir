"Illegal" means "prohibited"; not necessarily "by law", though that's the
most common use.  It's valid in other contexts, such as "prohibited by
the API".  "int *p = 1.5f" is illegal C code.  Google for "illegal chess
moves".
There may be political reasons to prefer "invalid" to "illegal", but that
doesn't make it incorrect.
