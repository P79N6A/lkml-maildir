But "GNU/Linux" does not accurately describe "where the operating system
as a whole came from"!  That is the biggest problem with your renaming
of Linux.  Linux builds on a whole lot of history in the Unix
environment, including GNU, BSD, and (for most people's workstations) X.
To follow your logic, the OS is "BSD/GNU/XFree86/Linux/etc." as a whole.
