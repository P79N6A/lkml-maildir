I think it's actually a bit of a pain to manage to do something early
enough to get it inherited by absolutely everybody.  But I take your point.
I had this code kicking around for quite a while before I was sure it was
useful enough to submit.  I hadn't noticed the MMF_DUMP_* code before it
went in, and then just merged without thinking much about the new code.
The dump_whole_segments option is a rarity and just duplicates
MMF_DUMP_MAPPED_SHARED exactly, so there is no real need for that I guess.
(When I wrote it, it was the only way to turn that behavior on.)
The dump_elf_headers option is specific to binfmt_elf, unlike the existing
generic MMF_DUMP_* options.  But that is probably not a kind of separation
that anyone cares about.
Bottom line, I don't care all that much about the configuration mechanism.
I just want the dump_elf_headers feature available.  (I'm going to make it
the default in the Fedora 8 kernel anyway.)
I guess init scripts can just do:
for f in /proc/*/coredump_filter; do echo $[0x10 | $(cat $f)] > $f; done
to be sure they get everybody, assuming it's before anyone is busily
forking children in parallel you might miss between reading the list of
PIDs and diddling the parent.

Well, it doesn't exactly test that it's not "file-backed".  (Technically
anything shared is file-backed, even if by a shmem virtual file.)  It tests
whether the backing file will probably ever be found on disk later.  That
gets shmem regions as well as originally-regular files that were deleted
while mapped.  I think we asked around when this test was put it and it was
deemed proper at the time.  (It doesn't really need to be a formal "what
does the vm situation mean" guarantee, just a practical "you probably
wanted that" test.)

I agree, it looked odd to me.  But I did not review (or notice) the
MMF_DUMP_* code before it went in, and this issue was unrelated to my
feature patch.

No, it was accessed the only place it will ever be needed, in the
initializer of binfmt_elf_sysctl_32bit_dir.
Thanks,

[PATCH] Add MMF_DUMP_ELF_HEADERS
This adds the MMF_DUMP_ELF_HEADERS option to /proc/pid/coredump_filter.
This dumps the first page (only) of a private file mapping if it appears
to be a mapping of an ELF file.  Including these pages in the core dump
may give sufficient identifying information to associate the original
DSO and executable file images and their debugging information with a
core file in a generic way just from its contents (e.g. when those
binaries were built with ld --build-id).  I expect this to become the
default behavior eventually.  Existing versions of gdb can be confused
by the core dumps it creates, so it won't enabled by default for some
time to come.  Soon many people will have systems with a gdb that handle
these dumps, so they can arrange to set the bit at boot and have it
inherited system-wide.
This also cleans up the checking of the MMF_DUMP_* flag bits, which did not
need to be using atomic macros.
