On the flip side, if I go back as far as 2.5.4<mumble>, I've had a lot more
days where the open-source drivers for my Xircom ethernet/modem card were
broken than days where my binary NVidia driver was broken.  Also, the Xircom
has been the cause of a lot more "hang before even single user mode" problems,
and several times the Xircom didn't start working again until there was a
complete overhaul of the Cardbus support, while there's not been that much
activity on the NVidia patch on www.minion.de.
It's certainly seemed like I've ended up "stuck waiting for a specific
small set of individuals" when the Cardbus support has broken (not to
slight them, they're all great guys and  do support the stuff) - how many
people on this list *really* understand that code?  And it's not just
the Cardbus stuff - there's a LOT of stuff in the kernel that's only
really understood by a very small number of people.
