Hi!
Configuration of my provider changed and now I'm in blacklist. Anyway,
it looks like swsusp2 is closer to merge...

> 7. Always-built-in suspend code.
> 8. Suspend core module.
> 9. Suspend user interface modules.
> 10. Suspend compression modules (encryption also planned).
> 11. Suspend image writer modules (generic file writer planned).
> 12. Documentation patches.
Looks good.

I believe it should be okay on linux-kernel. Individual patches are
quite small.
