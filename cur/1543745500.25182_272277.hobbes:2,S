I've seen one 2.4-based project which had essentially a userspace
blockdevice driver.  Marking that special, trusted process PF_MEMALLOC did
indeed fix low-on-memory deadlocks.  Obviously it's something one does with
caution, but there are times when it makes sense.
I think there are codepaths which unconditionally turn off PF_MEMALLOC, so
they need to be tweaked to do a save/set/restore operation for it all to
work.
