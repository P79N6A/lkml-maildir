Not everything is fine. hdparm documents -i returns inconsistent data.
Most, but _NOT_ _EVERYTHING_ is cached: the multcount is updated, for
instance. What is that good for? Mix & Match whatever is convenient?
Are there systems where -I will not work? If there are none, hdparm 6.0
should be shipped without the -i option.
