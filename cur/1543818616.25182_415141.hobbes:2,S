Right, I wasn't actually aiming to test the performance of the uts
namespaces themselves (despite including those numbers), since they're
not on hot paths.  I was mostly curious whether putting the utsns
pointer into the task_struct would affect performance at all, to know
whether to put that inside an #ifdef.  Based on the results, I kept it
non-#ifdefed even if !CONFIG_UTS_NS, and that's what I was justifying
with those numbers.
These tests should be done again when we get 3 or 5 namespace pointers,
and perhaps there should still be some other tests included, ie mainly a
forkbomb perhaps.  I just did my default set of tests that I usually
use.
thanks,
