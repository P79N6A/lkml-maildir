Hello again Mike,
I now have my doubts too. In fact, more than doubts. The pread()/pwrite()
which are currently (2.2.0-pre8 I know it is ancient...) in Linux are
wrong. If you look close you will see that they are nothing than just
read()/write() with the extra argument (pos) passed as position to the
fs-specific layer, instead of file->f_pos. Most of the required
(by Single UNIX v2) error checking is missing. Hence I cc:linux-kernel so
that it is fixed. (I will do it if I have time, but if someone is already
doing it, this mail adds even more reason to do so).
Also, in write() the use of struct inode * inode makes things tidier than
not using it in pwrite(). So, that can be tidied up as well.
Regards,
