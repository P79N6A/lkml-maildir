few more questions pertaining to hot swap..
1. 	how exactly do I build my linux kernel with hotswap support. When I do
	'make xconfig' (for linux 2.4.4 kernel) I don't see a hotplug option.
2.	If I write my driver according to the new way of writing PCI drivers for
    	ethernet cards i.e using MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE et al, is it enough to
make
	my driver hot pluggable.
3.	Does the NIC need to provide any particular h/w support to make it
	hotpluggable.
Thanks in advance
Koushik

If your hardware supports it - yes. You'll need something like the compaq
hotswap pci backplanes or of course simply use cardbus
