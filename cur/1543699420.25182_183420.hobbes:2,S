Hi Greg, what I meant was: should I make my patch friendlier to rmmod by
trying hard to drop the reference as soon as possible, though some code paths
may have to hold on to it for a long time (cost: code complication), or is it OK
to always hang onto the usb_device as long as one of the usbfs files is open
(cost: rmmod may take a long or infinite time; advantages: simple, robust)?
This lowly one humbly awaits enlightenment... :)
Thanks,
Duncan.
