So, does this mean you are happy if I produce patches with kernel/compat.c
in them rather than code #ifdef'ed into the mainline? This, of course,
begs the question of whether it should all go into kernel/compat.c or
should there be an fs/compat.c, mm/compat.c ...
At the moment, I just want to get something that we all agree on past
Linus and into his tree.
