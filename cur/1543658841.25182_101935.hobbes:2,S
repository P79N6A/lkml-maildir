I've downloaded the latest driver and am running 2.4.20 (yea!) -- the trident.c here 
is actually more recent than 2.5.55. It now loads fast and with no protest from 
ac97_codec, which has a new ID (ADS114). However, there's still not a peep (I try 
cat test.mp3 > /dev/dsp) -- and when KDE Control Center tries to restart the arts 
sound server, it alarmingly fails on "CPU overload" or just freezes the whole 
system. Is there anything I can do to get more information about what is not 
happening?
Cheers,
Peter
