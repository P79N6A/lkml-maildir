No, something more flexible is needed here.
For example, I have a Mini-ITX server here, which I personally have
equipped with a 3" 40W IDE cable that connects to a notebook drive.
The system currently uses UDMA just fine with the IDE drivers,
but I have not been able to convert it to use the (stock) libata drivers
because of this silly lack of end-user control.
We really need an override for this -- embedded folks would also apprecaate one.
Ditto for selecting transfer modes.
Cheers
