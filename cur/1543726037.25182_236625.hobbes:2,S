Those who are mirroring netdev-2.6 repository, please delete and 
re-clone it.
Attached is a summary of the current contents of the netdev-2.6 queue. 
Several groups of patches are either waiting for the kernel to get out 
of Release Candidate status, or are "simmering"... waiting around for 
additional testing and review.
netdev-2.6 is only available through BitKeeper, or Andrew Morton's -mm 
patches.
