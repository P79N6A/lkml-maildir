But the write command is not included in any source tree yet, and it works.

Jens is out of pocket and is somewhere over the Atlantic by now.
I may have to go and get him at the airport tonight.
We will have a month to fight between the two of us to get it correct.
I have all the devices local, there are some issues in getting things to
him because of availablity of early product development in the industry.
I expect by 10/20/2000 you will see Direct ATAPI published.

This will be fun when it is released.
Imagine direct read/write access to DVD regardless of filesystems.
It should also do CD-RW's, but not tested.
