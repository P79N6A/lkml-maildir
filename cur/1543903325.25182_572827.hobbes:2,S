I read "if you want to use it" as meaning "if you want to 
use "/sys/class/block", I.E. it was optional.
If /sys/block is going to remain a symlink to /sys/class/block then using the 
path "/sys/block" should work on both existing kernels and on new kernels 
without modification.
What moving it will force me to do is edit out "/sys/class/block' if I find it 
looking for char devices under "/sys/class".  Moving it forces me to add code 
to remove it.  I don't know what the supposed benefit is...
Ah, hang on.  Most likely this is an implementation detail from moving 
everything under /sys/subsystem and making /sys/class a symlink -> subsystem 
and /sys/block a symlink -> subsystem/block.  So it sounds like it's not 
really intentional breakage, just an implementation side effect.  Ok, that 
makes sense.
(Sorry, this hadn't occurred to me until now.  I'm not the one implementing 
this stuff, so I haven't spent the past few months thinking through the 
ramifications already.  This entire thread is one of about 12 things I'm 
working on at the moment.)

A yes, "set back up an automated -mm testing thing that away when previous

"All the distros" meaning "not Ubuntu 7.04"?  I just checked again, it doesn't 
have either a /sys/class/block or /sys/subsystem/block.  I realize they're 
coming...

I read the Documentation/ABI ones in the current linus -git (well, as of... 
tuesday?)  and am unaware of any conflicts.  I read sysfs-rules.txt this 
morning, and the only _required_ change I'm aware of is filtering 
out /sys/class/block if it occurs.  (Is there more Documentation in Andrew 
Morton's tree that's not in Linus's?)
Lemme re-read my document...
Ok, /sys/bus/*/devices/*/dev is the path Kay told me to use during our 
discussion at OLS.  It's one of the paths I cut and pasted out of the email 
he sent me.  He typed that path, I didn't.  I see that the bit 
in "sysfs-rules.txt" about never using the "devices" symlink contradicts 
that.  Ok, so what _should_ I do?
Personally, I've never seen a dev link under "/sys/bus".  I neither own nor 
have personally encountered hardware that does that, and the first I heard 
that there _was_ such hardware was when talking to him at OLS.
Kay: if you get this, what path should I use?  Your email said:
> /sys/bus/*/devices/*/dev
> /sys/class/*/*/dev
> /sys/block/*/dev
> /sys/block/*/*/dev
>
> /sys/subsystem/*/devices/*/dev
The fifth of which isn't in currently deployed kernels (not in kernel.org, not 
in most recent ubuntu release, that counts as "not currently deployed" to 
me), and the first four should continue to work even when that goes in, so I 
didn't include it in "how to find this information", but I note that it also 
follows "devices"...

I'm aware of that program, and can iterate through the tree and write "add" 
to "uevent" instead of reading "dev".  Technically the /sbin/hotplug approach 
would have the same potential race condition with remove happening during 
scan: the potential downside is leaving a node in /dev that will give 
an -ENODEV if you try to open it, which is annoying but not fatal (no obvious 
security implications or anything), and a small enough race condition that it 
would seldom if ever inconvenience real users.
I can document this, though...

I know.  At the moment I'm only trying to document the subset of sysfs needed 
to maintain a /dev tree via hotplug.  In future this may expand to include 
enough information to persistently name certain types of devices, but I'd be 
just as happy to have that under Devices/ABI and refer to it instead.

Ok.  Cornelia Huck seemed to disagree, but I see that's been resolved in 
another message.

Actually, I'm filtering them out, but I should make a note of it in the 
documentation.  (I'd happily document other events you might want to respond 
to that come into the hotplug mechanism, but I don't know what they are and 
am trying to start with the basics and flesh it out later.  Persistent device 
naming is a can of worms I'll have to open eventually.  Ubuntu 7.04 put uuids 
on every _partition_ in my laptop, and spins up my external usb hard drive 
trying to mount root.  When connected a machine with an IDE hard drive, 
that's now going through the scsi layer.  Sigh...)

It doesn't say that /sys/block are deprecated or will be removed.  The closest 
it says is:

Which isn't the same as "must be ignored" or "may be removed".  I asked about 
this explicitly at OLS ("can I just keep using /sys/block and /sys/class") 
and was told that there were no plans to remove them.
Existing systems require using the older names, and I'm unaware of any 
information the new names provide that the old ones don't.

Because I didn't want to encode an unknown structure of sysfs into the 
program?  Partitions were at the same level as hard drives one release (when 
I first came up with a working probing script for my Firmware Linux project, 
which according to my blog was October 27, 2005 and was using something like 
Linux 2.6.10), and moved into subdirectories the next, and I had no way of 
knowing if or when a third layer was going to be added to some future device 
I didn't know about.
Keep in mind I've been following this, on and off, for a while now:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/12/9/1
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/12/10/16
And what I did was in response to the endless loop was _stop_ traversing 
symlinks at all, and only followed subdirectories.  Which worked fine until 
subdirectories got moved and replaced by symlinks, which is when I started 
asking "so what paths can I follow that will reliably be there in both 
current and future releases"?  Which is what I'm trying to document now.

I'm trying to document what those paths are.
People keep wanting to tell me about future plans that aren't merged yet.  A 
year ago the future plans were directories becoming symlinks, now the plans 
are /sys/subsystem, I'm sure in a year there will be new future plans.  I'd 
really like not to have to change existing code to still work with them, 
hence an attempt to document the API I _SHOULD_ use so that I don't have to.
If I discard what's there now and document the current future plans that 
aren't merged yet, how do I know that they won't themselves be ripped out a 
year after that?

Can you get the default name of the device currently encoded as the last 
element of the path that "DEVPATH" points to (ala /class/mem/zero), but which 
I won't necessarily get if DEVPATH starts to point to /device/12345/:00 as 
some people keep saying DEVPATH should point to?
It's not encoded as one of the hotplug variables, other than extractable from 
DEVPATH in a way that may or may not continue to work...

You wrote both the sysfs code and the udev code.  You wrote both sides of the 
export, changed both sides of the export fairly freely, and you know what you 
intended to do and what was merely an implementation artifact.

I am aware of that, therefore I need to look at a known set of paths, which is 
what I'm trying to document now.

I don't clearly remember the details from two years ago, but after glancing at 
my blog 
http://landley.net/notes-2005.html#27-10-2005
 I vaguely recall that 
it had large numbers of undocumented environmental dependencies and I got 
sick of playing whack-a-mole installing packages, plus it had no 
documentation whatsoever and required a complicated configuration file to the 
point it was actually _easier_ to write a shell script to parse sysfs 
directly.  (Trying that got results in about 15 minutes.  Staring at udev for 
half a day did not.)
Plus I remember downloading different early versions of udev and finding 
things hugely rewritten between each update to the point that trying to pick 
it apart until it stabilized was a waste of time.
I also remember thinking that libsysfs sounded like a horrible idea (having 
your own copy of a shared library in the source tree defeats the purpose of 
having a shared library).  It was something that bothered me about the design 
from day one, libsysfs was in theory an external library but udev included 
its own copy, which made as much sense to me as including its own copy of 
glibc.  Here's the problem back in 2003:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0311.2/0716.html
Here's you replying to me on that topic in 2005:

That problem was only one reason I didn't use the project.  I objected to most 
of the design, at some length, in this post back in 2005:

Ok.  I note that most of the stuff I was objecting to in 2005 wouldn't _fit_ 
in 530 lines, and my first gripe in my blog post was lack of documentation 
and unnecessary complexity, neither of which appear to be the case now...

Udev appears to have changed, for the better.  I'm still uncomfortable

I did all that but the persistent device names in mdev, without ever referring 
to udev (after bad experiences with it in 2005), although I no longer 
maintain any part of busybox.

Various people asked me for documentation on hotplug and firmware loading, and 
what I know how to do with hotplug (because I had to work out how in 2005, 
and I'd like to nail down the approved way of doing it) is create /dev nodes.

Via netlink events?  I vaguely recall a thread about deferring all the "add" 
events until after a netlink daemon was up, but I thought you needed sysfs 
for that.

I've read the existing documentation that I've seen.  Unfortunately I'm too 
jetlagged at the moment to finish collating it, and I need to go look at this 
cleaned-up no-longer-scary udev when I'm awake.
