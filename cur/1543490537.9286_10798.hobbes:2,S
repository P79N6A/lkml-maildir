Yes, I think this was what I remember not paying proper attention to...
It is certainly one of these three, but I think it was this last one
I remember...
In my defense, I had just (mostly) recovered from serious bronchitis,
but was still having periods of feeling crummy; and as I had been
giving talks the previous two days to large audiences, I was just happy
it was a day when I didn't have to be "on", but could imitate a vegetable
or mineral, which I did that day, and crashed in my hotel room all evening...
