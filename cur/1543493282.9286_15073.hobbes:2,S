Which I do not like. pP'= fP | (fI & pI) might be OK for properly marked
execs. Though as you already know I'd argue that it should have an extra
term.  pP'= fP | (fI & pI & pP)  
For nonprivledged marked then it should be pP' = (fI & pI & pP).

fI should be assumed to be pP and it should use the more restrictive
formula which would in this case reduce to pP' = pI & pP.
I think as a default that is quite reasonible.

You are only allowed to add flags to pI that you have in pP according to
the now defunct posix standard.
I think the problem why you can't be more unixy is the formula.
pI and fI should not give your children more power than what you already
have in pP IMHO-- use fP to gain power(which should be privledged).
Using fI as a quasi-setcap just feels ugly.
