Not common at all.  Given that it wears the electronics a lot, it must be
either a defect (of the kinds Brazilian law forces the manufacturer to
either fix or give you your money back).
Assuming it also does this when running Windows, I'd report it as a grave
bug to the vendor and demand it to be fixed, or the machine to be exchanged
with another model that doesn't have this defect.
