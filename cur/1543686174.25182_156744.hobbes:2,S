It does... It is I tell ya!
Look, the gl thread is probably _very_ explicitly asking to sleep. No I
don't know how X works, but I have an idea that select is generally used
as an event notification, right?
Now the gl thread is essentially saying "wait until X finishes the work
I've given it, or I get some other event": ie. "put me to sleep until
this fd becomes readable".
OK maybe your scenario is a big problem. Its not due to any imagined
semantics in the way things are sleeping. Its due to the scheduler.
