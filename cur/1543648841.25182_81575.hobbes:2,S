   Thanks for your sugestion.  With Linux 2.4.19, the
   problem goes away.  So something is wrong with the
   2.4.20-pre kernels as related to the AMD Athlon...
To be honest, I have had a few relaibly reocurring lockups of my
Athlon at night.
I tend not to mention them however, because this machine has an AGP
graphics card where I've removed the brace that keep it in the AGP
slot, so it tends to slide out when it gets warm due to lots of 3d
rendering.... :-)
