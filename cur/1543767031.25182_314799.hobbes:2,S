Probably the most common way to get the simple but slow write function 
where the write() call actually writes to stable storage, and fails if it 
can't, is the O_SYNC open flag.
But even that, in some versions of Linux, can miss write errors.  It's not 
easy for Linux to catch them because the code that sees the I/O fail 
doesn't know if it's part of some synchronous procedure where the user 
will eventually find out about the error or the more common case where the 
application has optimistically walked away and nothing can be done but 
write off the loss.
