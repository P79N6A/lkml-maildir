I have started work on the patch for /proc/sys/kernel/tainted with the
corresponding modutils and ksymoops changes.  insmod of a non-GPL
module ORs /proc/sys/kernel/tainted with 1, insmod -f ORs with 2.
What to do about modules with no license?  Complain and taint or
silently ignore?  A lot of modules in -ac14 have no MODULE_LICENSE,
probably because they have no MODULE_AUTHOR.  IMHO the default should
be complain and taint, even though it will generate lots of newbie
questions to l-k.
