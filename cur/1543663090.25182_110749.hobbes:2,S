No it's not. Are you guys saying that module refcounting in net/core/dev.c 
is a hack too ? Patch that I sent implements exactly the same logic.
Grab module reference before creating net family socket and release
module when socket is gone. Where is the hack here ?

This comment makes no sense to me. Especially "let them stay buggy" part ;-).
(I wonder what Alex could have told you).

It's not a special hack. If it has problems let's fix them.
I want to keep Bluetooth socket modules loadable and unloadable. And I'm sure
Jean and other folks want's the same thing for IrDA and other subsystems with sockets. 
So, you guys would have to come with a better argument than "ohh it's an ugly hack" ;-).
Alexey, could you please post what you told Dave here ?
Rusty, any comments from you ?
Here is the link to the patch that I sent
        http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104308300808557&w=2
and here is some explanation about protocol families
        http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104317832227499&w=2
Dave, Alex, seriously let's come up with the solution rather than ignoring
the problem. I think my patch is a good solution. If you don't like overhead 
or whatever else let's fix that.
Thanks
Max
