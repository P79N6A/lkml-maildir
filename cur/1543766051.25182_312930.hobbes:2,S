Of course, there is none. In an unofficial capacity, there is just the
opinion and votes of the subsystem maintainers, extended team (e.g.,
Stefan and me), and kernel maintainers (Linus, Andrew, and Marcello).
The users are represented by the subsystem maintainers and extended
team. So, Arjan's opinion does not matter except to offer some voice of
reason.
I think I was first to raise objection upon the initial submission some
months back, and then I just observed the dialog. There are technical
merits for removal of the external symbols that I accept. I also accept
that we have no way of maintaining any sort of stable subsystem for
external projects we are not aware of or who are not communicating with
us about their requirements (it goes beyond just a stable interface).
Based upon my experience of several years on this project there is only
one external kernel module project we need to consider because that
developer has been involved and voiced requirements. That is Arne
Caspari's (The Imaging Source) DFG/1394 driver. 
I vote to remove external symbols not used by the Linux1394.org modules
or the module at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/video-2-1394/
Of course, I may be voted down, but I ask the others to be realistic
about what we are arguing for (i.e. just being defensive?) and consider
the fact that there are valid reasons for their removal.
