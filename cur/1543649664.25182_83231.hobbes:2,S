kernelhooks is similar to notifier lists (include/linux/notifier.h),
only much faster when there are no users. This patch does not
add any hooks itself, I am sure placement of each hook will be
critically reviewed.

Yes, this is possible, but I think using hooks is much cleaner.

As I see it, hooks should be used for allowing other kernel code
to tap into certain well defined paths in the kernel, say in
trap 3 or trap 1 handlers in the kernel to allow multiple 
kernel-level breakpointing tools. Or, certain well defined paths
(potentially fast paths) for traceing purposes, where it is 
necessary to ensure that for the most time there are no users 
of these hooks and their placement alone should place minimal 
overhead.
So, hooks are designed, placed at well thought-out locations.
Probes OTOH are mostly ad-hoc. While debugging a problem, if
you find the need to probe a specific code location for more
info, put a probe there, on the fly, with out going through 
the recompile and reboot cycle.

No, returning from caller will be much harder with [kd]probes.
Hope this clarifies the issue.
Thanks,
