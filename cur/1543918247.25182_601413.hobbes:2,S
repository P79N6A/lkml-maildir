Thanks Davide.
I modified the first para of the read description to make this clear:
       read(2)
              If the timer has already expired one or more times
              since   its  settings  were  last  modified  using
              timerfd_settime(), or since  the  last  successful
              read(2),  then the buffer given to read(2) returns
              an unsigned 8-byte integer  (uint64_t)  containing
              the number of expirations that have occurred.
(In the earlier version of the page the text talked about expirations
"since the timer was created".)
Cheers,
Michael
