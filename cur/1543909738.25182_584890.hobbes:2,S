Actually you would get a speed improvement. You hash
the full name and get the file number. You don't have
to break up the name into sections except for
evaluating name permissions.
The important concept here is that files and name
aren't stored by levels of directories. The name
points to the file number. Directory levels are
emulated based on name separation characters or any
other algorithm that you want to use.
One could create a file system and permission system
that gets rid of the concept of directories entirely
if one chooses to.
That's outside the box big time.
