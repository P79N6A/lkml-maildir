The SCSI drivers validate the controller's data phase based on the
expected phase presented to them from an upper layer.  I never talked
about adding checks that make little sense or are overly expensive.  You
seem to equate validation with huge expense.  That is just not the
general case.

I very much doubt that.  There are perhaps four or five tests in the
I/O path where some value already in a cache line that has to be accessed
anyway is compared against a constant.  We're talking about something
down in the noise of any type of profiling you could perform.  As I said,
validation makes sense where there is basically no-cost to do it.

So now the complaint is that validation code is somehow harder to write
and maintain than the rest of the code?
