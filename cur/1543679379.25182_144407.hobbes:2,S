Hi!
Just as when I tried 2.5.64, I get now the same result with 2.5.72.
When I reboot with the new kernel, I get:
   "Booting 'Linux-2.5.72'
   kernel (hd1,14)/vmlinuz-2.5.72 ro root=/dev/hdb2 hdc=ide-scsi
 [Linux - bzImage, setup=0x1400, size=0xdd72f]
   initrd (hd1,14)/initrd-2.5.72.img
 [Linux - initrd @ 0xf7cb000, 0x14d14 bytes]
 Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel."
And it hangs there, whether I compile with Mandrake-9.1 or RedHat-8.
I'd love to learn what I'm doing wrong.
Kindly CC to me.
