I think we're talking past each other.
In integrity.h there are two operation vectors defines:
 - struct integrity_operations delcares the operations called from the
   VFS.  This one is actually used.  While I don't agree to Dave's
   argument, because we don't put bloat in just because people might
   eventually some day use it when they are in the right mood and the
   sun shines, thisn't isn't the one I'm talking about in this thread.
 - struct template_operations on the others is not only really badly
   named for appearing in a global header but also not used in a
   meaningfull way.  There is one single instace of it,
   ima_template_ops, and while there are five helpers added in the
   second patch that use it (integrity_collect_measurement,
   integrity_appraise_measurement, integrity_store_measurement,
   integrity_store_template, integrity_must_measure) none of them
   is used at all during the patch series.  There are two direct
   uses of these template added in the third path, to implement the
   show operations for the "binary_runtime_measurements" and
   "ascii_runtime_measurements" files ins securityfs, but given that
   those are inside ima there no reason for the indirection at all.
