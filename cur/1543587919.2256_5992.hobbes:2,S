I had applied a similar set of printk's several weeks ago; however, 
now the problem refuses to recur.  Hmmm ... the last time I had a
problem that went away when I added printf's  ...
Just to be sure, I'm going to try running the kernel without the
printk's again.   Unfortunately, I upgraded the xserver yesterday,
and so I fear that may mask further re-occurances ...
