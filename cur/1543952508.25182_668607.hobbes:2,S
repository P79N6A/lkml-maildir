I used 8-core stoakley to do testing, and tried boot kernel with maxcpus=4 and 2.
Just ran ./hackbench 100 process 2000.

As stoakley is just multi-core machine and hasn't hyper-threading, I also tested it on an old
harwich machine which has 4 physical processors and 8 logical processors with hyperthreading.

num_online_cpus as the input parameter is ok. A potential issue is how to consider cpu hot-plug.
When num_online_cpus()=16, fls(num_online_cpus())=5.

So slub_min_objects= 8 + (1 + fls(num_online_cpus())) * 4.
