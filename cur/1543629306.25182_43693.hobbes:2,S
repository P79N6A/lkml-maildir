I kinda like to do 'make bzImage' without making modules also.
Would that be difficult to do in kbuild 2.5?
Oh, but then I would also (still) need 'make modules'...

So is there a downside to the coexisting method?
If not, let's do it.  (One reason: see below.)

For sure.
Any ideas about this error?  user error??
$ make oldconfig menuconfig

I removed all .tmp* files & dir., reran 'make oldconfig menuconfig',
and got the same results.
