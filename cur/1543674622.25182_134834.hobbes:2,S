hi!
I think current journal_release_buffer() which is used by ext3 allocator
in -mm tree has a bug. look, it won't decrement credits if concurrent
thread already put buffer on metadata list. but this may ext3_try_to_allocate()
may overflow handle's credist.
so, jbd will hit J_ASSERT_JH(jh, handle->h_buffer_credits > 0) somewhere
void journal_release_buffer (handle_t *handle, struct buffer_head *bh)
{
        .....
        if (jh->b_jlist == BJ_Reserved && jh->b_transaction == transaction &&
            !buffer_jdirty(jh2bh(jh))) {
                JBUFFER_TRACE(jh, "unused: refiling it");
                handle->h_buffer_credits++;
                __journal_refile_buffer(jh);
        }
        ....
}
here is the patch against 2.5.69-mm6:
