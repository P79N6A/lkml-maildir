I suspect that can be fixed by changing the built system. How can using O=
change the source file path anyway? That seems unnecessary.
It seems to be worse, full pathnames are also used when giving a relative path.
(I'm using O=../obj/).
On the other hand, it doesn't seem to cause that much bloat here:
$ strings vmlinux | grep /home/ |wc
    119     181    6400
CC'ing Sam Ravnborg, perhaps he has some ideas.
