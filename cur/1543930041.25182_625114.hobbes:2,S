Bear with me, because I'm no DHCP expert, nor any sort of kernel/networking
expert in any sense. (This is actually my first post to the lkml or to any
kernel developer.)
I found a problem with klibc's "ipconfig" program, or at least, behavior
that breaks DHCP on my thin clients (LTSP 5.0). It has to do with setting
the giaddr field on dhcp_send in dhcp_proto.c, line 164.
[snip]
static int dhcp_send(struct netdev *dev, struct iovec *vec)
{
 struct bootp_hdr bootp;
 memset(&bootp, 0, sizeof(struct bootp_hdr));
 bootp.op = BOOTP_REQUEST;
 bootp.htype = dev->hwtype;
 bootp.hlen = dev->hwlen;
 bootp.xid = dev->bootp.xid;
 bootp.ciaddr = dev->ip_addr;
 bootp.giaddr = dev-> bootp.gateway; //<-- HERE
 bootp.secs = htons(time(NULL) - dev->open_time);
 memcpy(bootp.chaddr, dev->hwaddr, 16);
...
[/snip]
I'm not sure why the giaddr field should be set on a DHCP request, but it
causes a Cisco relay agent with DHCP snooping turned on to drop the
request. I know ipconfig has options to both manually set a gateway and
configure the interface via dhcp, but IMO it shouldn't be sending it as part
of the DHCPREQUEST packet.
When I went to Cisco about the issue, this is exactly what they explained:
[QUOTE]
This looks like the thin client is not following the standards for DHCP
relay information specified in RFC3046. This RFC states the following:
A DHCP relay agent may receive a client DHCP packet forwarded from a
 BOOTP/DHCP relay agent closer to the client. Such a packet will have
 giaddr as non-zero, and may or may not already have a DHCP Relay
 Agent option in it.
 ***Relay agents configured to add a Relay Agent option which receive a
 client DHCP packet with a nonzero giaddr SHALL discard the packet if
 the giaddr spoofs a giaddr address implemented by the local agent
 itself.***
 Otherwise, the relay agent SHALL forward any received DHCP packet
 with a valid non-zero giaddr WITHOUT adding any relay agent options.
 Per RFC 2131 <
;
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs
 /rfc2131.html>, it shall also NOT modify the
giaddr value.
The part that I highlighted specifies that a relay agent should discard
the packet if the giaddr address is spoofs a giaddr address implemented
by the relay agent. This appears to be the case due to the fact that
the DHCP request packet has a giaddr address of the relay agent
specified in the DHCP offer.
[/QUOTE]
Now, when I changed the noted line above to:
bootp.giaddr = INADDR_ANY;
then recompile, and rebuild my initrd, the relay agent forwards the DHCP
request just fine.
Can anyone comment on why giaddr needs to be set on a DHCP request? Is this
a simple bug, or is there something deeper going on here?
