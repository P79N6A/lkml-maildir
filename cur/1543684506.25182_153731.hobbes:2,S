   any news?
   I have found that /var/log/kern.log has following messages (when 
trying to access blocks above 137GB, using e.g. badblocks):
Jul 29 00:41:02 jojda kernel: Attached scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel

   I have found where these are coming from (drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c) 
but  it's in fairly generic error routine that is called from number of 
places so it doesn't explain anything to me... (I'll take a look at it 
again but considering that I have almost zero experience with kernel 
programming it probably will not be very useful)
   this is using linux-2.4.21-ac4 kernel (scsi sata, as above messages show)
