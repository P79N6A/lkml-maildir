One interesting part of tiotest is the latency measurements.
Latency isn't printed by tiobench.pl though.  I think it's 
valueable information (and wish I had it).

Agreed.  I'm glad kernel hackers focus on latency too. :)
There are _some_ applications where throughput is critical 
though.  I would prefer to measure both throughput and 
latency at the same time, but am not yet clear on how to
deal with the Heisenberg principle.
