Well, suppose we eliminate 5% of all bugs each week.
Then after a year only 7% of the original bugs are left.
In a stable series that is a fairly good result.
In a series that is simultaneously "stable" and "development"
new random bugs are being introduced continually.
One never reaches the state with only few bugs.
