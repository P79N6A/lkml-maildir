So the kernel boots, activates the initramfs somehow to
become the first /, and then starts /sbin/init (e.g. kinit
from the klibc package).
And then?
The sources of kinit show that its job is parse the kernel
command line arguments, configure the NIC, mount the root
filesystem via NFS, etc. Other configurations might require
a different init to start hotplug and udev, or to handle the
LVM and crypto magic, for example. My point is that if there
is no one-for-all init process to handle _every_ possible
startup procedure, then it might be necessary to rebuild the
initramfs. This would be easier (and easier to test) if
initramfs is not compiled into the kernel, but a separate
image to be loaded at boot time "somehow".
Or did I miss something?
