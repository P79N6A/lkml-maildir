Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something here. I'm not sure I'm following the
importance of the 64bit extension. 
The clocksource code deals with counters in a range of widths (from
64bit TSC to 24bit ACPI PM). The only requirement there is that have
accumulate often enough that it doesn't wrap twice between
accumulations. Currently this is done in update_wall_time(), but the
patch Steven sent that started this thread adds an interim step using
cycle_accumulated, allowing update_wall_time() to be deferred for longer
periods of time.
I do see how the method you're describing could be applied to just the
cycle_accumulated management, and maybe that's the whole point?
However my concern is that when we do the frequency adjustment in
update_wall_time, I'm not sure the method works. Thus we still would
have to have a lock in there for gettimeofday().
But let's continue...

Ok, that would avoid one type of error, but in both of my examples in
the last mail, now was greater then last.

Again, I'm not sure I see how this resolves the previous example given,
as in that case the update code was delayed in between its reading of
now and the final pointer change.
The issue is that the race isn't just between the readers and the
writer, but that time races against writer as well. So if you don't lock
the readers out during the write, I'm not sure how you can avoid the
window for inconsistencies.
