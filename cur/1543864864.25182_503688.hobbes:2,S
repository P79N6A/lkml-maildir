Even though I'm late to this thread, here are some additional thoughts...
Rafael is wrong; wake_up() doesn't remove a task from a wait queue.  It 
makes the task runnable, and then the task removes itself from the wait 
queue after verifying that the necessary condition has been satisfied.
Thus calling wake_up() on a task in the refrigerator will accomplish 
nothing -- no good and no harm.  The task will remain frozen, and when it 
is unfrozen it will realize that the condition has been satisfied and will 
remove itself from the wait queue.

While it's true that one doesn't need to call wake_up() from .resume(),
you are overlooking the point of Oliver's question.  .resume() can start
up an I/O operation which can then complete before the tasks are
defrosted.  The I/O's completion routine generally _will_ end up calling
wake_up() on some still-frozen task.  That's just as bad as calling it 
yourself from within the resume routine.
