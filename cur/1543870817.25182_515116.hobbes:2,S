Evgeny, other folks on this thread read what you said, so let's not drag

I was referring to dropping an event directly to a userspace buffer, from 
the poll callback. If pages are not there, you might sleep, and you can't 
since the wakeup function holds a spinlock on the waitqueue head while 
looping through the waiters to issue the wakeup. Also, you don't know from 
where the poll wakeup is called.
File binding heavy? The first, and by *far* biggest, source of events 
inside an event collector, of someone that cares about scalability, are 
sockets. And those are already files. Second would be AIO, and those (if 
performance figures agrees) can be hosted inside syslets/threadlets.
Then you fall into the no-care category, where the extra 100 bytes do not 
make a case against the ability of using it with an existing POSIX 
infrastructure (poll/select).
BTW, Linus made a signalfd sketch code time ago, to deliver signals to an 
fd. Code remained there and nobody cared. Question: Was it because
1) it had file bindings or 2) because nobody really cared to deliver 
signals to an event collector?
And *if* later requirements come, you don't need to change the API by 
adding an XXEVENT_SIGNAL_ADD or XXEVENT_TIMER_ADD, or creating a new 
XXEVENT-only submission structure. You create an API that automatically 
makes that new abstraction work with POSIX poll/select, and you get epoll 
support for free. Without even changing a bit in the epoll API.
