Ok, so the important thing is propagating failures up to the exit code, then?
When making this patch I hit a problem that the exit code of "unifdef" seems 
to depend on whether it found anything to remove within the file it was 
processing, so when I changed the caller to actually care about its exit code 
it spontaneously aborted.
Fixing that probably does require changing unifdef.c.

*shrug*  Ok.  I await your C version, and have a workable patch meeting my own 
needs in the meantime.
