swap space doesn't need to be twice as big as ram. That's fixed long
ago.
swap+ram is the total amount of virtual memory that you can use in
vmware.

that's a silly restriction of mkswap, the kernel doesn't care, it can
handle way more than 2G (however there's an high bound at some
unpractical level, to go safe the math limit should be re-encoded in
mkswap, of course it changes for every arch because the pte layout is
different).
