I agree.  I have two BP6 systems, both with dual 366s (tried to Overclock
to 550 with mixed success).  While I can easily get no lockups, the board
has too many issues an I cannot recommend it for any mission critical or
server operations.  Dual celerons is great if it meets your need, but put
it on a different board.
