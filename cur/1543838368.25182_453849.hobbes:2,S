The following two are exactly equivalent:
<--  snip  -->
tristate BAR1 "bar1"
	depends on FOO
tristate BAR2 "bar2"
	depends on FOO
<--  snip  -->
if FOO
tristate BAR1 "bar1"
tristate BAR2 "bar2"
endif
<--  snip  -->
I'd say the latter is a bit better, but there's no reason to convert all 
subsystems since the two forms are equivalent.
In this case, I was looking for a way to fix the breakage of the ATA 
menu indentation due to SATA_INTEL_COMBINED, and this is the solution I 
did choose.
