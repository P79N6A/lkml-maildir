This analysis actually stemmed from my work to port OpenSSH to a headless
(non-UNIX, non-POSIX, non-protected-memory, diskless) network appliance. SSH
only needs real entropy for the keys generated by ssh-keygen. It's
complete overkill for session keys.
And guess what? Stock Portable OpenSSH (v3.4p1) uses /dev/urandom
(configure.ac):
# Check for user-specified random device, otherwise check /dev/urandom
AC_ARG_WITH(random,
        [  --with-random=FILE      read entropy from FILE
	(default=/dev/urandom)],

This patch is perfectly compatible with your netdev-random patches, in
fact I encourage it's resubmission after this one gets
in. /dev/urandom users will get all the benefits of network sampling
without /dev/random suffering at all.
