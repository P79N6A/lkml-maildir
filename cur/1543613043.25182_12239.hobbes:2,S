Yes, I thought of that, but this might produce more memory pressure than
needed. 
Regardless, it looks like I won't need this after all - the device has
internal memory controller which was misprogrammed. I think I corrected
this so it looks to be working now.
However, the question of how to get pages from a given range is
interesting in itself..
                 big thanks to everyone who responded :))
