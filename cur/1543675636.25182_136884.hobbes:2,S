Oh, I saw that discussion. I fully agree. If I can help the process of 
creating a sanitized userspace set of kernel headers I'll be happy to.
In the meantime, a small change to a kernel header, that provides _zero_ 
functional difference to the kernel itself (it's only there for source 
code checkers, as best I can tell) shouldn't break existing userspace 
libraries.
If it's going to, then we should just go ahead and break everything and 
get it done right. It's late in the 2.6 game, but the first few steps on 
the path have already been taken.
