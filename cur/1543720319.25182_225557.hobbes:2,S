Unfortunately there are just, flat-out, way too many kernel messages at 
boot-up.  Making them KERN_DEBUG doesn't solve the fact that SMP boxes 
often overflow the printk buffer before you boot up to a useful userland 
that can record the dmesg.
The IO-APIC code is a _major_ offender in this area, but the CPU code is 
right up there as well.
