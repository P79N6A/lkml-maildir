Yes, it's known problem. Recent 2.4 kernels shutdown the IDE disks
on halt/poweroff, which is extremely annoying on alpha when you return
to SRM prompt to boot another kernel. You'll have to wait until
the disk spins up again.

Send me please "lspci -vxxx -s 0:d" outputs for
- old (working) kernel;
- new kernel before and after "hdparm -d1".
