I was wondering the same thing about peripherals.  The
README in aic79xx driver from adaptec states that the driver
is supported on x86 only.  So I was wary to spec model 39320
HBAs in x86-64 machines.  I'm sure Adaptec is using the term
"support" in the most corporate sense possible, but what if
it really does scribble the disk under SuSE 64-bit kernel?
