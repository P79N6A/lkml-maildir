And indeed it was the firmware.
ftp://ftp.qlogic.com/outgoing/linux/firmware/
Until now, I've been using version v4.00.27, which is the last 
numbered version in that FTP directory.
Upon closer inspection, I picked the file called 
ql2400_fw.bin_mid
with a timestamp from 12th February 2008.
This one turns out to be v4.03.01 and it SOLVES THE PROBLEM :-)
It seems to work with qla2xxx v8.01.07-k7 (2.6.22.6) and
v8.02.00-k5 (2.6.24.2).
My testbed server has passed some 5 loops of dd over the weekend.
Thanks for your help :-)
I'm installing a 64bit Fedora to give XFS another try...
