I'm running stock kernel on a Fedora 7. uname -a tells 
Linux sandel.gameloft.org 2.6.22.9-91.fc7 #1 SMP Thu Sep 27 23:10:59 EDT
2007 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
In the stock 2.6.22.9 kernel, I see a bugon on slub.c, the code is this:
2196 static struct kmem_cache *get_slab(size_t size, gfp_t flags)
2197 {
2198         int index = kmalloc_index(size);
2199 
2200         if (!index)
2201                 return NULL;
2202 
2203         /* Allocation too large? */
2204         BUG_ON(index < 0);
Hope this helps,
Cheers,
Alex
