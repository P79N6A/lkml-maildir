I just installed a ATI Radeon 7500 into my system and since I couldn't
sync both console and X acceptable (there was always a 4mm horizontal
missmatch) regardless that I always use fbdev for X. I connected my
SyncMaster 171T with a DVI-cable, whow no missmatch at all!
Astonishing my framebuffer driver now switches to the correct resolution
during startup itself, phantastic! I now could remove "fbset -a
1280x1024-60' from my profile. I can only advice anyone to switch to DVI
if he has a chance.
