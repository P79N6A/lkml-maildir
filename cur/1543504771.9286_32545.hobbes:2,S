1. I'm also interested in finding a way to identify threads sharing address
spaces, which is why I recently posted an attempt at doing so.  If you can
propose soultions to the race pointed out by Alexander Viro, I'd be
grateful.
2. What makes a shared address space the criteria for identifying different
"threads" in a process?  The Linux model is a lot more flexible than that,
and I'd like to stick with that flexibility.  <Insert plug for my up and
coming CLONE_PID solution that everyone hates right here>.  Using address
spaces instead means that we DON'T get to see the relationships between
clones that may share just signal handlers, or just share files.
