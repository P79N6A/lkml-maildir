Never occurred to me to build ACPI w/o CONFIG_PM...
There are #ifdef CONFIG_PM in the acpi code, so I guess this was on
purpose, but it makes ACPI a lot less interesting.
But I'm inclined to leave 2.4 alone except for real system failures. 
The only clean-up I'm really interested in doing in 2.4 is when it makes
maintenance via backporting from 2.6 easier.
