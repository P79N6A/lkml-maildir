The main problem with this documentation is that, wherever I have
seen it, it comes _only_ as few sizeable Postscript files.  Like
this (after 'ls -s' so sizes are in kilobytes):
 120 /usr/share/doc/iproute-2.2.4/api-ip6-flowlabels.ps
 336 /usr/share/doc/iproute-2.2.4/ip-cref.ps
 124 /usr/share/doc/iproute-2.2.4/ip-tunnels.ps
Mighty helpful if you happen to have only a text interface as is often
the case when you work on more complicated routing setups.  It is also
excellent for grepping (NOT!) through a 60 pages long document if you
want to find something on a particular topic.  Unfortunately it was not
apparently written in 'texinfo', or similar, as then one would have also
_at least_ .info files and an easy way to search through the whole thing
does not matter what kind of a display you have.
HTML format would be of some help but searches through that, especially
if multiple files are involved, are also not that nice.  Right now your
best bet is probably to print that out and carry a stack of papers with
you wherever you may need it.  Other than that you are currently reduced
to '/sbin/ip help' although you may follow up with something like
'/sbin/ip addr help' and you will get something to parse. :-)
