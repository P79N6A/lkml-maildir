Which is another issue besides PCI express.  This 32bit VM on a 64bit
box I find quite annoying.  Now that there are 64bit x86 alternatives
I won't be shy about using 64bit addresses in BARs, if I need them.  
On a box with 4G or more you need PAE anyway...
I'm wondering if ioremap or set_fixmap could be modified to take
a page frame number or possibly a token like the dma mapping functions
so we don't need all of the low bits and can actually solve these
problems on a 32bit architecture.

The first draft of the patch had a u64 there.  So I think we should
at least check to ensure the high half is zero.  If it the high half
is not zero we can print an annoying error message.  All of the normal
pci capabilities are still limited to being in the first 256 bytes of
the configuration space.  So not a lot is lost if we can't enable the
entire 4K. 
There is also one piece I did not see the PCI Express configuration
space for the root complex.  This is a configuration space with no pci
bus/dev/fn numbers, if my memory serves me correctly.
On the interface side I also have the question how it will be
described when there are multiple memory configuration spaces
corresponding to disjoint pci configuration spaces.  I don't think
we can easily support that in Linux at the moment but there is no
reason why there can't be a table entry for it.
