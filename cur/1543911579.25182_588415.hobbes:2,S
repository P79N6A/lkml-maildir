Well, the drive is reporting an error on a write to the disc. It's not 
an error code in the MMC5 standard, though, so presumably it's a 
vendor-specific error code.
Not sure why it would be writing to the disc though.. Maybe if the disc 
is mounted read-write it is doing last-access-time updates or something?
