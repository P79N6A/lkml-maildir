Hi
I'm running 2.4.18-pre9
I disabled APM, because I ACPI won't work with enabled APM.
Maybe this is normal.
Laptop: Sony vaio pcg-qr10
I boot with frame buffer and vga=normal (fb doesn't work, no tux...)
And now:
tbxface-0099 [01] ACPI_load_tables : ACPI Tables successfully loaded
Parsing Methods :...................
154 Control Methods found and parsed (479 nodes total)
ACPI Namespave successfully loaded at root c02fd500
ACPI: Core Subsystem version [20011018]
evxfevnt-0081 [02] Acpi_enable : Transition to ACPI mode successful
Executing device _INI methods: ............. (13 points)
After that the output stops but the systems starts up, onyl the output...
What is my problem ACPI or Frame Buffer. I've have VESA 2.0 and vga 
configured.
Do I need special vag= options ?
All options from the manual don't work, lilo takes only the default lilo 
options. (my lilo supports hex 0x things if you trust the manpage)
thanks
have fun
Felix
