Subject: [PATCH] Fix warnings in selection.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/22/236

<linux/selection.h> assumes that struct tty_struct has previously been
included.  If not, this pile of warnings will result:
  CC [M]  drivers/video/console/newport_con.o
In file included from drivers/video/console/newport_con.c:18:
include/linux/selection.h:16: warning: 'struct tty_struct' declared inside param
eter list
include/linux/selection.h:16: warning: its scope is only this definition or decl
aration, which is probably not what you want
include/linux/selection.h:17: warning: 'struct tty_struct' declared inside param
eter list
include/linux/selection.h:20: warning: 'struct tty_struct' declared inside param
eter list
Fixed by adding a forward declaration of struct tty_struct.
