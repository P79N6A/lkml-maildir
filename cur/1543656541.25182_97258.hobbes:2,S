Actually, I think Marcello's got the stable process pretty well
figured out without any of this committee business. And given that his
credibility as 2.4 maintainer depends on his holding to the mandate to
make the kernel stable, he probably doesn't have too hard a time
holding the line. As benevolent dictator, you're simply not beholden
to such expectations and I doubt the committee approach would work for
long either.
So perhaps you should throw out a date for 'code freeze' and then plan to
hand off to the 2.6 maintainer at that date. 
The other piece that will help is if the timeline for 2.7 shows up
around then and is short enough so that people won't despair of ever
getting their big feature in.
