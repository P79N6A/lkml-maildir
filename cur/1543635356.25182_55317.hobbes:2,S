I believe this is the case on these particular controllers. They are in
fact 147x controllers, with a 154x emulation mode. I used to support
lots of legacy equipment at Dell, and I believe that's the case, but if
Matt wants to chime in to confirm that or not, would be helpful. There's
lots of info on this as I believe there are still plenty of customers
actually still using 4100's and the like.
