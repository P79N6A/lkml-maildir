I've also worked on such system.
I understand it's difficult all drivers use that kind of an interface.
But if some common drivers like scsi, FC and LAN drivers use such interface,
it's usefull for most users.

But, when the read thread continues without noticing the error
(before the error is asynchronously notified),
the thread runs based on wrong data and may panic.
So I think PIO read error must be notified synchronously.
On the other hand, PIO write error can be notified asynchronously,
because software does not use it.
