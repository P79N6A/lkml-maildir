	Certainly not the crazy people.  But the random person who's
just humming along?  We should be nice to them.

	I just mentioned to Ted in another mail, since this is a
"permanent" change to the on-disk structure, why is this a mount option?
Shouldn't it rather be a tunefs(8)/mkfs(8) option?
	In general, anything you pass to "mount -o" is optional.  You
can mount with option X, then unmount and mount without option X.  Most
people "expect" this to work (Principle of Least Surprise).  So, when
you do:
    # mount -o extents /fs1
    # create_file /fs1/newfile
    # umount /fs1
    # mount /fs1
it breaks.  Lease Surprise expects it to work.
	However, tunefs(8) and mkfs(8) is generally understood to make
physical changes.  Why not "tunefs -extents" to turn them on?  It's
completely analogous to "tunefs -J", will fit everyone's expectation,
and won't surprise people.  "mkfs -extents" does the same thing.
