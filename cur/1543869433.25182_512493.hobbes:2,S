Subject: Problems with init of Marvell PCI Express SATA Card

I am running a relatively recent 2.6.20 
Linux kernels running on both an Intel 
x86 (XEON) as well as one a embedded 
powerPC target (MPC8548E).
I believe my PCI Express interface is 
working correctly on both the embedded 
target as well as - of course - on the 
XEON platform (I have other cards that 
I have working correctly).
The problem is that this Marvell PCI Express 
SATA Card is NOT being probed and thus, 
the SATA/ATA host interface is NOT being 
initialized, and thus the drive is NOT being 
detected/added able to be mounted...
I have more (in)sight into the embedded 
platform, and the SATA module is being 
built into /loaded by the kernel (it does 
a pci_device_register()), but nothing happens 
after that - I see before that the card IS 
being seen on the BUS - I can do a "lspci" 
after that - and the device is on the PCI bus...
I should also add that I have the identical
card on the PCI bus (6042 chip) and the
driver works flawlessly...
What am I doing wrong? Do I need to have 
the PCI ids in the kernel match identically 
what is on pci express sata card device?
Heck, if there is a PCI device register - 
why isn't there an associated probe - no 
matter what?
I apologze if my question is a little 
naive, I am not a PCI expert - I was hoping 
that this would go smoothly enough that I 
wouldn't need to become one!
thanks in advance for all your wisdom!
Sincerely,
Tom Morrison
