Dr. Russinovich's observations pointedly miss the point.  His attempt, 
and failure, to define enterprise service in his editorial merely
highlights the fact, a point I will return to below.
Yes, scalability is important for an enterprise server.  Yes, raw 
hardware efficiency is important for an enterprise server.  However, 
they are not crucial.  All systems everywhere have been inefficient 
when compared with their successors.  What _is_ crucial is reliability.  
NT is unique among candidates for enterprise service in that it 
entirely lacks this feature.  It is meaningless to compare the 
efficiency of a running system against one which might have done some 
operations faster if it had not crashed.  It is even less meaningful 
to speculate erroneously which operations those would have been.
I promised to return to the issue of how to define enterprise
service.  My own definition of an Enterprise Server is:
  A computer system which performs an essential service for a large
  organization.  A key feature distinguishing an enterprise server 
  is that the effects of even a short-term failure exceed the entire 
  cost of deploying the system.  For example, it takes only a few 
  minutes' down time at a nationwide stock exchange to justify the 
  expense of entirely replacing the system with something more 
  reliable. 
More succinctly: "An enterprise server does not crash."  
Until NT attains a difficult-to-measure level of reliability,
its advocates would be wise to avoid mentioning it on the same
page with the word "enterprise".
