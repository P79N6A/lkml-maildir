I'm aware of the problem but I'm not actually sure what to present as
the appropriate solution yet; in the new scheme, cardmgr should just
ignore these cards and not load any module at all (as /sbin/hotplug 
should do that).  But I haven't decided how cardmgr will deduce that.
By the way, in my hands, PCMCIA serial cards do work ok with the 2.4
PCMCIA modules as of test12-pre7.  So I'm not sure what's going on in
Ted's situation, if the non-kernel PCMCIA is working: there should
not be much different for 16-bit cards.  I do seem to have some new
problems with Cardbus cards that I wasn't having with earlier 2.4
releases but I haven't made any attempt to figure that out yet.
