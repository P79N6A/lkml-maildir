After conducting some further research I've determined that cool n quiet has 
no effect on this "bug" if you can call it that. With the system running in 
init 1, and cool n quiet disabled in the bios, a sleep(N>0) results in the 
run_time value afterwards always being nearly the same value of ~995000 on my 
athlon64, similarly, my server an athlon-tbird, which definitely has no power 
saving features, hovers at ~1496000
Obviously since these values are nowhere near 10000, the loops_per_ms 
benchmark runs forever, has anyone seen/read about sleep on amd machines 
doing something odd? Can anyone else with an amd machine confirm this 
behavior? Con: should we attempt to get the attention of LKML to see why amd 
chips act differently?
