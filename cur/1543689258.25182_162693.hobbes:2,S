No, the initramfs code is in 2.6 right now.  The boot processes uses it
too.
What has been postponed to 2.7 is the moving of some of the boot code to
use it some more.  But that's really just a matter of someone doing the
work (and adding it to the build process properly.)  There are a few
patches floating around somewhere that do this with the exception of
intregrating into the build.
thanks,
