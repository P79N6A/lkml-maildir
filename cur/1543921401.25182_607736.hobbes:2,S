I pulled next branch of git and applied your patch.
When running
 	git log --follow -B arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux_64.lds.S
I got no output at all (in a newly pulled linux kernel dir).
When I ran
 	git log arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux_64.lds.S
I got:
commit 250c22777fe1ccd7ac588579a6c16db4c0161cc5

    x86_64: move kernel
    Signed-off-by: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
    Signed-off-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
With -B alone I got same output.
When I add --follow I get no output.
I could not get back to my previous git binary - I replaced it
with the new one.
