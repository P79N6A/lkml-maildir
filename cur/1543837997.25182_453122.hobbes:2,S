Oh, sorry I have forgotten to tell:
drunken init # lspci |grep Prism
00:08.0 Network controller: Intersil Corporation ISL3890 [Prism GT/Prism 
Duette]/ISL3886 [Prism Javelin/Prism Xbow] (rev 01)
So I'm using the prism54 driver (CONFIG_PRISM54). My version of wireless-tools 
is 29_pre10 and the version of the used firmware is 1.0.4.3.
BTW: I tried
# modprobe prism54 pc_debug=1
and 
# modprobe prism54 pc_debug=9999999
But it doesn't increased the verbose level.
The firmware upload was successfull (according to dmesg).
