OK, it looks like nfs_writepages() might have been encountered the
congested flag and it baled out without doing anything - the inode is still
on the temporary s_io list, and no pages were redirtied, hence the inode
wasn't redirtied, hence it remains stuck on the s_io list.  The patch I
sent will fix that up.
