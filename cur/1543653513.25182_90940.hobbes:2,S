The approach is that there are really two different things happening:
1. Detecting when someone is trying to use our IP
2. Generating an ARP packet (which might be set to our IP, depending on 
whether we are claiming or defending)
The first part is easy, as long as you have BPF support. Consider that it is 
just a peer to tcpdump, only we don't want all the packets.
The second part is OK, you just need to generate raw packets. The real 
functionality is in net/packet/af_packet.c, although I use Libnet
http://www.packetfactory.net/projects/libnet/
in an attempt at portability.
It might help to think of it as generating a single ARP packet (or a packet 
that has the ARP format, on the wire), rather than performing the ARP 
functionality.
