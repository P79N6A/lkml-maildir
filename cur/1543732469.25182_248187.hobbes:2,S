Do all events require an attribute? What about the "overheating"
example? Would you need an attribute or would getting a "signal" for a
specific kobj be enough? 
Binding an attribute to an event would at least tell you the name of the
attribute to check. Otherwise, how does an app know the name of the
attribute that changed? Or am I missing something?
Thanks,
