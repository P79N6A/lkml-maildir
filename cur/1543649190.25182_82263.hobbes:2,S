Hello all,
After several days running kernel 2.4.20-pre7 I came across the syslogged
message:
kernel: ip_conntrack: table full, dropping packet.
This box runs about 10 rules for destination nat. My simple question: is this a
bug, or a need to tune something? If it is a bug, is there a later kernel that
has it fixed?
