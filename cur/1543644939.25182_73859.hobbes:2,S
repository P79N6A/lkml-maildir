"Incompatible with this kernel" for ipchains seems so that you have compiled 
Netfilter stuff into your kernel.
"itself or the kernel needs upgrading" for iptables seems so that you either 
haven't compiled netfilter as module(s) or static into the kernel and forgot 
something in the kernel config.

Check your kernel config. "make menuconfig" or "xconfig" and goto:
Networking options  --->
  IP: Netfilter Configuration  --->
and look if you did it properly.
