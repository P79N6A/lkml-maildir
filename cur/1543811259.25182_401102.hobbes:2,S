I agree 100%, plain text serial files are *easy*.
Given the swiss-army knife of tools we have at our disposal (cat, cut,
head, tail, sed, awk, split, sort, grep  and many more), plain text
files are very easy to manipulate - not to mention write apps to
manipulate. And that is a very good thing IMHO.
I can imagine quite a mess if I open a file that is really a view of
several files and then start manipulating text in it across "actual
file" boundaries  that could blow up easily.
