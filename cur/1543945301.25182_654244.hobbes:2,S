Yes, but changes are mostly trivial. No insurance of typos and thinkos
though. OTOH, it survived my tests.

I'm lazy to subscribe on occasional patches. Yup, this is hardly
an excuse...

It should not. Because with CONFIG_FB_FOREIGN_ENDIAN enabled, drawing
might be a little bit slower, because of external checks for endianness
(I didn't noticed any slowdown, but I guess it's still measurable if we
find some fb benchmark).
Thinking about it a little bit more, I believe we want to add a choice,
which exactly foreign endianness we want to compile-in. Then, if we're
pretty confident that particular BE machine uses only LE framebuffer,
gcc can optimize away endianness checks.
Patch on top of previous inlined here. With that patch, slowdown is
possible with CONFIG_FB_BOTH_ENDIAN option only, which is still
default if FOREIGN_ENDIAN is selected.

Nope, it should not break anything, just possible fbconsole/tux drawing
slowdown.
Thanks,

Subject: fb: add support for choice foreign endianness
With this patch FB_FOREIGN_ENDIAN converted to menuconfig with the
choice inside: which type of foreign endianness we want to compile-in.
As a bonus, now fb subsystem will refuse to register framebuffer with
unsupported endianness, and will suggest a way to solve the problem.
