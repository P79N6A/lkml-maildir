Hija,
I've seen surprisingly few messages about the dramatic size increase
between a simple 2.4 and a 2.5 kernel image. 
I just decided to check back with the 2.5 series again after my last try
with 2.5.53 (which wouldn't even boot) but had to dramatically cut down
the kernel featurewise to keep it below 1MB because I can't boot it over
tftp otherwise.

954880 Mar  4 17:01 vmlinuz-192.168.11.3-2.5.63
What you see here is a 2.4 kernel with almost everything needed to run
the machine built in and a (rsync'ed) 2.5.63 kernel with everything but
the basic stuff + ipv4 + NIC + NFS (+ other necessary features not
builtable as modules) built as modules.
Are there any patches I've missed to get that down? A slight tad bigger
and I couldn't even work with recent kernels if modules actually
worked... :/
