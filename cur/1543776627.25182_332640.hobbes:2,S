Apart from the wart that defines know zilch about scopes.
Thus completely fine looking code will give you atrociously
obscure compiler message. Real world example for userspace:
# cat t.c
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdio.h>
void f() {
    char errno[] = "hello world";
    puts(errno);
}
# gcc -c t.c
t.c: In function `f':
t.c:5: error: function `__errno_location' is initialized like a variable
t.c:5: error: conflicting types for '__errno_location'
/usr/include/bits/errno.h:38: error: previous declaration of '__errno_location' was here
