*nod* I was just paraphrasing the original statements. I'd have to agree
here; there's -way- too much quoting of the halloween documents.
VinodV's original open-source analysis seems to be the best to draw on; it
doesn't send any negative images (no "we're a 'threat' to Microsoft",
etc), and merely paints us in the best possible light. I'd drop the quotes
from the paper that Josh and Vinod collaborated on (the second halloween
document). I'd also strongly suggest that we -not- actually refer to the
sources as the "Halloween documents". Bad imagery for a positive press
release.

If done tastefully, and it's spread out a bit more (for example, take
VinodV's comments about opensource and linux from the first halloween
document, a few unrelated quotes, and then a briefer version of the quote
from Halloween III.

REDMOND, WA - January 18, 1999 - Microsoft Corporation today put forward a
bold shift in strategy, with the announcement that they will be
discontinuing support for their Windows product line, and placing their
hopes with the Linux operating system.
Microsoft employee Vinod Vallopillil was quoted as saying that "Linux is a
best-of-breed UNIX..."
*grin* Be sure to get a couple of good RMS and Eric Raymmond quotes in
there too. ;-)

That was part of why I posted; some of those quotes in the current draft
have been pretty mangled from the original halloween documents.

I would -strongly- suggest that someone have a lawyer look over the final
result anyway, before it is released. I believe this is the first "real"
press release that's been put together for a standalone kernel release, so
it would pay to make sure we don't get anyone in trouble over it. Perhaps
the kind folks at Linux International would be able to spare a suit for 10
minutes or so? :-)
On the other hand, Linus could just announce this with his usual gusto
(greased weasel, anyone? :-), and we could save a lot of trouble. *grin*
