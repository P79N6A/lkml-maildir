thanks, i have picked up the other 4 patches. This one did not apply due 
to 4 other changes in x86.git#mm:
 Subject: x86: move page related declaration
 Subject: x86: make stack size configurable
 Subject: x86: make sparsemem vmemmap the only memory model
 Subject: x64/page.h: convert some macros to inlines
