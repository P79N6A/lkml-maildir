Subject: driverfs updates, part 2

Ok, here is the next round of driverfs updates. 
Short summary:
- move device and driver interface to driverfs into drivers/base/fs/*.c
- Implement bus_{create,remove}_file and driver_{create,remove}_file to 
  give people an interface to create files those object types in their 
  respective directories. 
  driver_{create,remove}_file are the simplest, and exist in 
  drivers/base/fs/driver.c. If people are feeling frisky, and want to 
  play, use that as an example on how to extend driverfs for other 
  subsystems and object types. 
  I'm also attaching an example 'subsystem' driver that exports 
  registration and unregistration functions that do creation and teardown 
  of driverfs directories. 
- Remove references to struct device in driverfs, making it completely
  independent of the device model core.
- Update documentation

Note that this tree includes all the changes that I posted earlier today.         
bk://ldm.bkbits.net/linux-2.5-driverfs still exists, with only the earlier 
changes. 
This will update the following files:

   driverfs:
   Remove all struct device references.
   Don't touch device's reference count on open() and close()
<mochel@osdl.org> (02/07/18 1.753)
   add functions for creating/removing driverfs files for device drivers
<mochel@osdl.org> (02/07/18 1.752)
   bus driver driverfs interface:
   include fs.h
   fix compile error
<mochel@osdl.org> (02/07/18 1.751)
   Move driverfs directory creation for drivers to drivers/base/fs/driver.c

<mochel@osdl.org> (02/07/18 1.748)
   driverfs:
   - make driverfs_create_file do duplication of driver_file_entry passed in (instead of making each caller do it)
<mochel@osdl.org> (02/07/18 1.747)
   Implement bus_{create,remove}_file, to allow creation of files for bus drivers in the bus's driverfs directory
<mochel@osdl.org> (02/07/18 1.746)
   Make root bus directory dynamically allocated, like the rest of the directories in the world...
<mochel@osdl.org> (02/07/18 1.745)
   Make sure mode is set when creating bus directory
<mochel@osdl.org> (02/07/18 1.744)

 * This is a sample subsystem to illustrate how easy it is to latch on to
 * driverfs and exploit it. It is the 'pub' subsystem. Objects of type 'beer' 
 * can be registered and unregistered with the pub via beer_register and 
 * beer_unregister.
 * 
 * Every time a beer is registered with the pub subsystem, a directory is
 * created for it. The pub subsystem could then create files on behalf of
 * the beer, in the beer's directory. Once the beer has registered, it
 * can create files for itself in its directory. A second, more robust
 * example will surely follow.
