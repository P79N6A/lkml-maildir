The 'linus' one seems to be the parent, because if I try to pull from
it bk tells me that the tree is for the private use of Linus only.
And all the other 2.5 repositories seem to be slighly out of date
(the linux/linux-2.5 one is at -pre3 instead of -pre5 etc).
So, what is supposed to be the definitive, public bk repository, 
to pull from in order to have the latest changes ? (the one which will
go on bk.kernel.org eventually)
