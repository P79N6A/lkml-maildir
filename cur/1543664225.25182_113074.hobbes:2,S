If you are going to print it in hex do make it clear but one
0x should be enough: 0x16:45 is OK, 0x16:0x45 is hideous.
Given that the way i would identify device would be to grep
for the numbers in an ls of /dev i'd much rather they be in
decimal.  It all depends on how people will use the values.
When would i use the hex representation be useful?
