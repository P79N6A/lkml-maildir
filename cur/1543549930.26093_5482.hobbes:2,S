I want to develop a platform-independent driver (Windows 9x/NT/2000, Linux,
Mac OS,...).
I have written the Windows platform version in C++ using Numega's tools
encapsulating the driver code in classes.
More of this classes isn't OS specific and it work well in any OS.
This is the reason because I want to do this. I want reuse a lot of code.
Thanks.
-Abel.
