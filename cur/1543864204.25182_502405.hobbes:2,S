Could we get these to take struct timespec instead of struct timeval?
Right now we have a real problem in that the interfaces that *set* times 
take struct timeval (microsecond granularity) but the interfaces that 
*get* times return struct timespec (nanosecond granularity), which means 
information loss on any setting operations.
