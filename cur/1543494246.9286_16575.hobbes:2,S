This is just a sign of congestion in the RPC layer. If the server is
not able to treat the NFS requests fast enough, then a backlog of
requests builds up in the RPC layer, and as they time out, they fire
off the above messages.
I must admit, however, I'm not yet sure about all the causes of these
errors.  I've been seeing some under 2.2.6, which seemed to point to a
problem with sockets: typically, a UDP socket returns -ECONNREFUSED
without having transmitted anything to the server. Perhaps somebody
with better understanding of the UDP layer has some suggestions as to
what is going on in these cases?
Cheers,
