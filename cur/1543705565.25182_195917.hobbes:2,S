Hmm.. I could have *sworn* that abandoning something to the public
domain prohibited any disclaimer-of-liability clauses - the original
reason for the MIT X copyright was because they couldn't disclaim
liability if they let it into the public domain.  It's the same basic
"by copying, you agree to our terms" copyright that essentially all
open-source depends on.
And if it's in the public domain, they don't have to agree to your terms,
and thus you can't enforce that liability disclaimer..
Smells fishy, needs to be looked at by an actual copyright expert.
