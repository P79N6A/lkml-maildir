> 1. which device is at port address 0xCFB? (please note, NOT 0xCF8)
0xcfb ('bee') is the fourth byte of the 32 bit register that sits/starts
at 0xcf8 ('eight'). Note the difference in the code between the outb and
outl calls.
To answer your other questions, I think you'd have better luck reading
the spec for the x86 pc-style PCI bridge chip, rather than the (generic)
PCI v2.0 spec itself. The spec for the actual chip is always the final
authority for what's going on. (Unless, of course, it's wrong...)
