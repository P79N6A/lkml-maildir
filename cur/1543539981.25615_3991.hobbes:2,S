Well, with the current code he will get OOM after a while. Hey, there are
easier ways to get that - just keep doing chdir into really deep tree...
It needs to be fixed, but IMO the right answer is "don't give that power
to malicious user". mount _is_ a priveleged operation, after all. But yes,
this thing with stacking them over the same point needs to be fixed. IMO
"replacement" semantics is the right way to do that, but there are other
variants. It will be fixed one way or another before the 2.4.0-final.
