The hell it is.  You get wrong fields of a big struct read and modified.
Silently.
Besides, I can show you fsckloads of cases when we do *NOT* pass a
pointer to struct the timer is embedded into.  Some of them called directly
(and no, the thing they get as argument doesn't point to anything that
would contain a timer_list).
