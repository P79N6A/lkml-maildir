Hi,
Is it really worth all the added complexity of making swap
over NFS files work, given that you could use a network block
device instead?
Also, have you ensured that page_file_index, page_file_mapping
and page_offset are only ever used on anonymous pages when the
page is locked? (otherwise PageSwapCache could change)
