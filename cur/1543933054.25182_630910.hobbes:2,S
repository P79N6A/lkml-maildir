There is still more consolidation that can be done, but this is a first step.

That would require touching each and every arch's headers so as
not to break it with the generic changes.  I seem to get berated
for that sort of thing more often than asked for it.

That's not really true of any ptrace request that isn't already
wholly arch-dependent, and not true of any majority of those either.
For all of the things that are likely to be handled in generic code
any time soon, it's the caller of ptrace whose natural data formats
reign.

Indeed.
