Subject: [PATCH 0/7] inflate pt1: refactor boot-time inflate code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/24/207

This is a refactored version of the lib/inflate.c:
- clean up some really ugly code
- clean up atrocities like '#include "../../../lib/inflate.c"'
- drop a ton of cut and paste code from the kernel boot
- move towards making the boot decompressor pluggable
- move towards unifying the multiple inflate implementations
- save space
I'm sending this out in three batches. This first batch is core
clean-ups without arch-specific changes.
