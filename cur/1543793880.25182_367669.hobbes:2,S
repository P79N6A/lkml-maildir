I can enable this just fine by using "make config", making
sure to enable CONFIG_NET_SCHED, then CONFIG_NET_CLS_BASIC,
and then the necessary classifiers (including U32) are offered
to be enabled.
Perhaps there is something amiss in the configuration mechanism
you are trying to use.  So you might want to tell us which kernel
config menu program you are trying to use so this can be debugged
further.
