The interesting thing from other reports is that it appears to be kswapd
using up CPU resources.  Not the swapout code at all.  So it appears
to be a fundamental VM issue.  And calling swapoff is just a good way
to trigger it. 
If you could confirm this by calling swapoff sometime other than at
reboot time.  That might help.  Say by running top on the console.
