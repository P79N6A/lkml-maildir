At least you're on a similar wavelength to me, so perhaps you can
answer my original question rather than providing me with unwanted
information about how to do something I don't want to do !!!

It is my opinion that in these circumstances, they would not in fact
be able to mount the proc file system, and thus would be unable to use
any holes therein to break out of it, but I'm by no means a security
expert, and thus would appreciate comments from others.
Please note that the "If you want that, why not mount the proc file
system before chroot'ing them there" type of answer, which is all that
I have received so far, is completely irrelevant to the question being
asked, and replies of that nature will be ignored as a result.
Best wishes from Riley.
