Hi all,
A happy Australia Day to all my Aussie comrades.
News:  I will be on leave for the rest of the week, so there will
probably be no linux-next release until Feb 2  (I know I said this on
Friday, but I really mean it this time :-)).
Changes since 20090123:
Dropped trees (temporarily):
	cpu_alloc (build problem)
	audit (difficult conflicts)
I merged the mfd tree immediately after Linus' tree instead of applying
the build fix patch it has.
The driver-core tree gained a build failure that caused me to revert a
commit.
The ide tree gained a conflict against the driver-core tree.
The net tree lost its build failure only to gain another that caused me
to revert a couple of commits.
The sound tree lost its conflict.
The slab tree gained a conflict against the ftrace tree.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git
(patches at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sfr/linux-next/
).  If you
are tracking the linux-next tree using git, you should not use "git pull"
to do so as that will try to merge the new linux-next release with the
old one.  You should use "git fetch" as mentioned in the FAQ on the wiki
(see below).
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
a ppc64_defconfig for powerpc and an allmodconfig for x86_64. After the
final fixups (if any), it is also built with powerpc allnoconfig,
ppc44x_defconfig and allyesconfig (minus CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES) and
i386, sparc and sparc64 defconfig.
Below is a summary of the state of the merge.
We are up to 132 trees (counting Linus' and 18 trees of patches pending for
Linus' tree), more are welcome (even if they are currently empty).
Thanks to those who have contributed, and to those who haven't, please do.
Status of my local build tests will be at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/linux-next
 .  If maintainers want to give
advice about cross compilers/configs that work, we are always open to add
more builds.
Thanks to Jan Dittmer for adding the linux-next tree to his build tests
at 
http://l4x.org/k/
 , the guys at 
http://test.kernel.org/
 and Randy
Dunlap for doing many randconfig builds.
There is a wiki covering stuff to do with linux-next at
http://linux.f-seidel.de/linux-next/pmwiki/
 .  Thanks to Frank Seidel.
