This is a difference in our definition of robustness and is not subject
to resolution here.  To me robustness means working or recovering (if
possible) even when someone else does somethine wrong.  If, instead,
your definition is working well when everyone plays by the rules, then
there is nothing to be fixed here.
In any case, thanks for your efforts on the CD-ROM module.  I use your
work daily and this is the only problem I've encountered with it.
Bob
