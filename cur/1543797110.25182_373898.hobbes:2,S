But now doing the Right Thing will be easy, as the wrong code isn't
duplicated all around anymore: it is only in one place.  ;)
We have just done a small refactoring, trying to keep behaviour.
I haven't analysed deeply the current code to check if the "lock
emulation" could be replaced by a better approach. But at a first look,
it didn't look wrong to me. I am open to suggestions on how to replace
the write_urb_busy checking by something better.
So, at least we agree that using atomic_t is better than the current
approach, right? So, do you agree that, _if_ we chose to keep the
write_urb_busy "pseudo-locking", we could at least remove the code
duplication for that and use an atomic_t instead of spin_lock+int?

I am open to suggestions on how to build a round wheel in this case.  :)
