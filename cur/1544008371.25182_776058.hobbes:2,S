On Power, I see a hang in all three flavors of RCU when CPU hotplug
is enabled and dynticks is not.  I have not yet seen this hang on x86.
On Power, the hang occurs in the CPU-offline code, and is identical to
the hangs I was seeing in 2.6.27, except that "sleep 1" does not hang
in recent 2.6.28 versions.  So the timeout is apparently failing to fire
(or being ignored) for some other reason.
Is this similar to what you are seeing on x86?
I am currently undergoing a line-by-line code walkthrough of rcutree on
the off-chance that all three versions of RCU suffer from the same bug.
(And I have found a few bugs and spelling errors, but nothing related
to the problem at hand.)  If I don't find anything, I will start looking
more closely at the CPU-hotplug code.
