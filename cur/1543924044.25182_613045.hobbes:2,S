Description doesn't match the code.  And in the non-matching uid case,
check_kill_permission typically returns an error before it reaches
cap_task_kill (modulo the special cases).

I'm confused - if you are allowing all signals within the same uid, then
what was the point of having a cap_task_kill at all?  cap_task_kill was
supposed to prevent a process with lesser capabilities from killing a
process with more capabilities, even if they have the same uid, so that
when you have a program marked with file capabilities instead of a
setuid-0 program, that program can't be sent arbitrary signals by the
caller.
