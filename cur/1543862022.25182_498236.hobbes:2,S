Did you read the thread I linked in my original report? The original
bug report was for a regression from 2.6.18.1 to 2.6.20-rc3. I have
reproduced the same regression between the debian 2.6.18-1 kernel
and 2.6.20-rc3. I think you're looking in the wrong place for the
cause of the problem....
Cheers,
Dave.
