Plus I do not have firewire attached disk here, so sbp2 should not be
used, right?

The others look even more innocent. I wonder if this may have been
responsible?

    mm: Remove slab destructors from kmem_cache_create().
    Slab destructors were no longer supported after Christoph's
    c59def9f222d44bb7e2f0a559f2906191a0862d7 change. They've been
    BUGs for both slab and slub, and slob never supported them
    either.
