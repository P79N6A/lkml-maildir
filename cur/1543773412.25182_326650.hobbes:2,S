Hi,
let me add my 2 cents here, as I have been toying around with this idea,
too..

I tried monitoring the output of the embedded controller register dump
that the "ibm-acpi" kernel module provides, using the following command
and then moving the Laptop (Thinkpad T42) to trigger changes:
  watch -n1 cat /proc/acpi/ibm/ecdump
Alas, there wasn't really a pattern that convinced me that the chip
actually is monitored via this controller. But of course it may not harm
if somebody else double checks this.

On Windows, you need to run a separate tray application that enables the
protection. So it seems like it's implemented in "userspace". It may be
worth debugging what this Window applet actually does...
Bye,
