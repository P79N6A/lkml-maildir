I've seen similar hehaviour (machine halts) with a BT848 on a VT82C686
board while displaying the picture on a radeon card under X.org 6.8.1.
Heavy HDD IO almost certainly caused soon death (recognizable by heavy
picture distortion), while an idle system lasted one evening. It did not
happen with kernel 2.4 and a NVidia card on XF86.
These errors were caused by memory corruption, the first four bytes of some
pages were overwritten with binary data (which affected some files in the
cache).
Now I've upgraded to X.org 6.8.2 and done a first stress-test (copying
large files from network to local HDD), and I still can post.
