Good idea. Another need may be a sdio_read[bwl]_sync, which will poll for the
end of the cmd52s, instead of waiting for the irq. This polling is faster than
wait_for_completion/irq/tasklet/complete mechanism, which involve several
context switches.

I dont remember sdio spec forcing HW registers to be LE. Function 0 registers
are (BLKSZ for ex), but Function 1-7 register may be BE if the designers found
an advantage to it..
