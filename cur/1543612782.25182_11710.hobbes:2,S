Yes, I tried every hash in ReiserFS.  Please have a look at Larry McVoy's 
'linear congruential' hash in the bitkeeper code.  It's decent.  In fact, the 
only good hashes I've found after trolling all over the internet are that 
one, and the one I wrote, both based on combining a sequence of characters 
with a well-known pseudo-random number generation technique.
