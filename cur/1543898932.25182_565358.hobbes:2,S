in the next revision. We are re-using the LRU lock, since the
isolate_pages callback is called under the zone's LRU lock.

I remember that we discussed having one limit, but we can come up
with a configuration parameter to do it. I'll do that in the
next release.

A lot of the code for the reclaim logic and the meta_page is yours.
Please do identify patches where you would like to see your
signed-off-by and where you think the entire patch is completely
yours.
