I meant uninitialised memory but I also wonder could something like this
happen if you are trying to use memory that doesn't exist. i.e. you are
trying to access more memory than you really have but you indicate later
that this is not the case.

err, that doesn't sound very healthy.

INIT would be the first MOVABLE allocation so it would be using memory
at the end of the physical adddress range. i.e. the crash happens when
memory towards the end and the only difference between the patch applied
and reverted is when it happens.
Could you try booting with 16MB less memory using mem=?
