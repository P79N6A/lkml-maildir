The goal of reiserfs is not to get every person, who has invented yet
another namespace that can share the interactions it conducts with no
other namespace, to convert to reiserfs.  The goal of reiserfs is to one
by one eliminate the reasons why these new namespaces keep getting
invented rather than using the filesystem namespace.  I cannot
unify the namespaces, I can only somewhat reduce the reasons why they
fragment, and pontificate a bit at those who fragment them.
Two filesystem layers are indeed terrible.  What you are doing is not
analogous to, say, putting a file system ontop of a disk driver which is
ontop of a piece of hardware, no, you are writing a C interpreter in
Pascal.  You are putting a motorcycle seat ontop of a truck chassis, and
then you are asking me to define why a truck chassis isn't as functional
as a motorcycle chassis, and given that you have already built a truck
chassis, you ask why it is that I think you won't have all the
functionality of a motorcycle using your motorcycle seat and handlebars
ontop of a truck chassis.  What you want to do is like telling the TCP/IP
guys when they wrote TCP/IP that they should be using the serial line
driver as the bottom layer of their TCP/IP implementation, putting the
TCP/IP stuff in user space, and then preaching about the benefits of
increased portability to other Unixes that would result from that.
