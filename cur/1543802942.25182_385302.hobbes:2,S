I'm actually somewhat inclined to not pull any more. We've had lots of 
(hopefully minor) issues for the last few days, and I know that people 
had DRM issues with the -mm tree (which I assume tracked this tree) not 
more than a week or so ago.
IOW, I want to make sure that my tree is somewhat stable again. I don't 
want -rc1 to be horrible.
