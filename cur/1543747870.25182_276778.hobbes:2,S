The tabs have been turned into spaces. Either add 'ull' to 0x0badbadbadbadbad
or apply the attached version (don't edit/copy/paste it if you are not sure
that the tabs are preserved).

A backport of the test version of the 2.6.x driver (SG, RX/TX csum, up to ~7000
bytes frames, patch against vanilla 2.4.28) is available at:
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/people/francois/misc/20041205-2.4.28-r8169.c-test.patch
For the curious one, the patchscript version can be found at:
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.4.x/2.4.28
It compiles but it is completely untested. You should probably wait a bit until
I verify it is not trivially broken. Otoh, if you have some spare time...
