I think many people wish it was ignored on smaller devices too given
what it does to write performance.  And if your device is flash based
and is one of the ones that doesn't have proper wear leveling the card
won't last long with sync enabled (even with wear leveling rewriting the
fat that often as sync seems to do can't be good for the lifespan of the
flash).
I suspect either vfat should ignore sync all the time, or it should at
least warn about its use so distributions don't think enabling it on all
removeable media is a good idea in general.  Or perhaps the vfat driver
could be made to wait for a file to be closed or at least have some
timeout before updating the fat table again.  Not sure.
