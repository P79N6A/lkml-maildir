Hi there. My shiny new Dell Inspiron 8100 arrived in the mail today... Wiped 
Windows XP, installed Debian, and compiled myself a 2.4.17 kernel w/herick's 
IDE patch.
However, the system locks hard when I boot it up. The point where it dies 
varies - it got as far as starting cron one time.
Compiled a vanilla 2.4.17 & got the exact same thing. I'm not doing anything 
exotic.
ACPI is disabled, APM is configured thusly:
CONFIG_APM=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK=y
CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT=y
# CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS is not set
# CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF is not set
The 2.2.20 kernel that Debian installed seems to work ok.
Anyone else seeing anything like this?
P.S. Please CC me on replies, I'm not subscribed. Thanks.
