Btw, what about arch/x86_64/kernel/hpet.c?
That thing seems totally broken. Lookie here:
  arch/x86_64/kernel/hpet.c:irqreturn_t hpet_rtc_interrupt(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs)
  drivers/char/rtc.c:extern irqreturn_t hpet_rtc_interrupt(int irq, void *dev_id);
anybody see a problem? The x86-64 version doesn't seem to be very well 
maintained. Is there some fundamental reason why this file isn't shared 
across architectures?
