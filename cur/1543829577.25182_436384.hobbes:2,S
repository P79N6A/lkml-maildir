Andrew,
  When I make mrproper to clean the kernel tree with the -mm trees (at
least the last few releases) I end up having to remove
/include/linux/dwarf2-defs.h myself.  This file is generated at build
time but mrproper isn't cleaning it up.   This file is always present
in a tree that has been built but not in the origninal tree so a diff
of the tree picks it up.
Is this expected?
Thanks,
  Keith
