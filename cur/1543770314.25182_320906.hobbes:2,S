Beware: not a kernel hacker, not even a proficient programmer.
It seems it would be easy, just changing the max current loop device
number value (256) to something higher (i.e., 4096). Note, however, that
loop devices are described by an array of structs statically allocated at
module load time, so expect memory usage to grow linearly and search operations 
on the array become slower at least linearly.
There is one thing that maybe would need some attetion: minor number
allocation for loopback block devices. Now they are assigned at module
initialization, but I don't know the current status in the Linux kernel
with respect to (major,minor) sizes and allocation.
Hope someone more knowledgeable jumps into this :-)
