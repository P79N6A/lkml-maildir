Linus FYI, I was able to modify the radix tree test harness to catch
the bug and can no longer trigger it after the fix. Resulting code
passes all other harness tests as well of course.
Should be applied ASAP. However, unlike Andrew I don't think this is
a filesystem corrupting bug (maybe he was talking about NFS?).
