If you want an exact size, int32_t, uint32_t, etc. are what you'd need to 
use.. Typically "long" is the biggest that can be handled in single machine 
instructions, though there is no guarantee of this (I think the language 
standard only guarantees that long is as least as big as int and at least 32 
bits).
