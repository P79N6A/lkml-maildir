Hi guys,
by accident I selected the anticipatory IO scheduler as default in my
kernel config, but only the CFQ was built in. The anticipatory and
deadline were only available as modules. This caused an oops at boot.
After selecting CFQ as default schedule and a recompile and reboot
everything was fine again.
Regards
Marcel
