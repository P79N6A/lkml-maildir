Hi,
I've been playing around with linux-2.3.9, and I noticed the benchmarks from
hdparm give lower performance, than before the fully page-cached buffering
(at least, that's what I think the problem is...) was implemented.
This is the output from hdparm -T /dev/hda:
Linux 2.3.5:
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   64 MB in  0.50 seconds =128.00 MB/sec
Linux 2.3.9:
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   64 MB in  0.53 seconds =120.75 MB/sec
That's a ~9% decrease in buffer-cache reads.
Please send a copy of any replies to me in private email as well as the
mailing list.
Thanks,
    Dan
