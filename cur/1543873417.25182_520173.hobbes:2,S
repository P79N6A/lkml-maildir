If you remove that invariant, then it is very difficult for device drivers 
and other code to make use of aio_complete().

Which was from irq context last time I checked.

That implies nothing -- aio_complete() has to acquire ctx_lock and cannot 
be called holding the lock.  Sure, it could probably be split into 
__aio_complete() and have aio_complete() wrap it acquiring the lock.
