That should be OK. We basically aren't too interested in
exactly which CPU it should go to, but just that it should
go to that group.
If the group is determined to be the idlest, and there is
a CPU that can run the task, then that's all we need.

In Linux, the for_* macros actually *are* for loops. So that is
that loop that your continue continues, and seeing as it is at
the end of that for loop, it does nothing.
