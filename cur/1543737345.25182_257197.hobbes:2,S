We are in sync on this... Hopefully, everybody else as well.

Exactly, you do the movement from cpuset through higher level operations 
replacing the per task cpu-affinity with a shared object.
This is what CKRM does at the core level through its class objects.
RCFS provides the high level operations. The controller implements them
wrt to the constraints and the details.

Why ? It is even useful for 2 cpus.
Currently cpumem sets do not enforce that there is not intersections 
between siblings of a hierarchy.

That's one of the sticking points.
That would require that TASKCLASSES and cpumemsets must go along the 
same hierarchy. With CPUmemsets being the top part of the hierarchy.
In other words the task classes can not span different cpusets.
There are other posibilities that would restrict the load balancing
along cpuset boundaries. If taskclasses are allowed to span disjoint
cpumemsets, what is then the definition of setting shares ?
Today we simply do the system wide share proportionment adhering to the 
affinity constraints, which is still valid in this discussion.

Tricky in that it needs to be decided what the class hierarchy 
definitions and whether to CKRM cpu scheduling within each cpuset and 
what the exact definition of share then is ?

I agree its not insurmountable but a matter of deciding what the desired
behavior is ...
