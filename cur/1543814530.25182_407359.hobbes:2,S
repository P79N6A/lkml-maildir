What you're missing is that journal_start() and journal_stop() don't
create a transaction.  They delimit an operation, yes, but multiple
operations are grouped together to form a transaction.  Transactions
are only closed when after the commit_internal or if the journal runs
out of space.  So you're not going to see a dummy transaction which
the buffers are attached to; instead, all of the various operations
happening within commit_interval are grouped into a single transaction.
This is all explained in Stephen's paper; see page #4 in:
