Subject: ipw2200 only works as a module?

With CONFIG_IPW2200=y I get:
ipw2200: ipw-2.2-boot.fw load failed: Reason -2
ipw2200: Unable to load firmware: 0xFFFFFFFE
but with CONFIG_IPW2200=m it works fine. If it doesn't work when built into the 
kernel, why even give people the option?
BTW, a better error message than "Reason -2" would be nice. =)
