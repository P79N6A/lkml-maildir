Hi all-
 There is a little problem with the system networking header file 
/usr/include/socketbits.h (which is brought in by socket.h) such 
that it cannot be included in a C++ program without causing 
warnings that should not be present from system headers.  Simply
using 'extern "C"' will not it.
 Basically the problem is due to an old C hack where folks 
assume the macro NULL evaluates to 0.  In C++ NULL is defined
as '(void*) 0' which is quite distinct from zero, and may not 
be freely converted to an integer.
 Here's the gcc output:
/usr/include/socketbits.h: In function `struct cmsghdr *
__cmsg_nxthdr(struct msghdr *, struct cmsghdr *)':
In file included from /usr/include/sys/socket.h:34,
                 from connect.cxx:8:
/usr/include/socketbits.h:204: warning: ANSI C++ forbids implicit
conversion from `void *' in return
/usr/include/socketbits.h:213: warning: ANSI C++ forbids implicit
conversion from `void *' in return
 The 'diff' output to correct the problem follows:
204c204
<     return NULL;
---
>     return 0;
213c213
<     return NULL;
---
>     return 0;
Thanks,
