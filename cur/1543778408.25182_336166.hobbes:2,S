Yes. #879 is the one that mentions that this might be a kernel bug (so
I reported it here):
"I suspect this is kernel bug and it conserns ISA support.
I would be happy if you kick some kernel developers buts because they
have ignored my bugreport for quite long time now."
I don't know how correct/incorrect the above may be, but I figured it
was possible.
I'll report what I know in bug #879.
Thanks.
