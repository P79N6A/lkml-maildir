Take a look at swsusp patches. With your
snapshotting-filesystem-possibility, it should be possible to have
"global undo".
I.e. at 21:30 I do system snapshot. At 21:50 I delete my dev which
makes me unhappy. At 21:51 I issue undo which brings 21:30 state EVEN
WITH RUNNING PROCESSES back.
(Imagine: running complicated game that does not allow you to save
game. And what? You just snapshot full system :-).
I did not look at your code, but it looks sexy.
