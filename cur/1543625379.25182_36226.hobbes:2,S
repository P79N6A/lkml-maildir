That's probably not the place to look, since drives will conform to the
specs in place when they were designed. If older specs did not require
automatic spinup, then ATA6 doesn't apply.
In the real world I have seen drives which definitely didn't like commands
in spindown, so unless there is some really large penalty for sending that
I would suggest having the logic support the existing hardware. We still
have 386 and FPE emulation, I would bet there are more older drives than
386s in use (at least by my clients ;-).
