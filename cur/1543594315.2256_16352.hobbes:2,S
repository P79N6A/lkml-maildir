It is used in two cases.  If a filesystem has:
1. case-insensitive filenames (its much better to have the names 'FOO' and
   'foo' refer to the same dentry, since they refer to the same file)
2. a limited filename length and your filesystem truncates names (on a
   non-vfat filesystem 'dosfilen.ame' and 'dosfilename.ame' would be the
   same file and the same dentry structure).
