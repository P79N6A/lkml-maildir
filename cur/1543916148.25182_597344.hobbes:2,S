Hello all,
As the title suggest.
"i" is declared as 0 and never assigned a new value.
Down the code there's an if (i>40) and a certain dangling piece of code.
I assume that I should have gotten a string length (?) from somewhere?
Am I missing something?

static void
dik_show_trace(unsigned long *sp)
{
	long i = 0;
	printk("Trace:\n");
	while (0x1ff8 & (unsigned long) sp) {
		extern char _stext[], _etext[];
		unsigned long tmp = *sp;
		sp++;
		if (tmp < (unsigned long) &_stext)
			continue;
		if (tmp >= (unsigned long) &_etext)
			continue;
		printk("[<%lx>]", tmp);
		print_symbol(" %s", tmp);
		printk("\n");
		if (i > 40) {
			printk(" ...");
			break;
		}
	}
	printk("\n");
