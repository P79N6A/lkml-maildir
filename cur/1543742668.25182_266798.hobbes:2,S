Indeed.  Kyle's comments were clearly without basis in fact.  Saying
that you aren't bound by the terms of the license because you didn't
download the code, your co-worker did, is no different than saying "hey,
look at this!  A copy of the Linux kernel!  Now how did that get here?
Well, I didn't put it here so I think I'll ignore the terms of the GPL."
Best of luck on that logic.
