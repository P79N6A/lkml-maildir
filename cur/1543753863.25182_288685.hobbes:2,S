Hi,
  I'm trying to strip modules a bit (2.6, x86) using
strip -R .not -R .comment --strip-unneeded module.ko
  It seems to keep intact relocation & ksymtab symbols, tested on my
configuration and seems to reduce the overall size for about 10-15%
(usefull for embedded). Does anybody know if there is any pitfalls with
that ?
Thanks,
Aleks.
