Setting this value to a non-zero variable should reboot
a kernel on panic .. right ? It doesnt seem to be
working for me on a 2.2.13 kernel.. Is there somebody
outthere who has encountered problems doing this  ?
Is there something else that needs to be done besides
"echo  5 >/proc/sys/kernel/panic"  to cause  a reboot
on panic.
Thanks in advance
Rajeev
