I see why you would want to merge them, but is it worth the trouble?
They are not identical. For one thing, early handoff installs its own
fake interrupt handlers (Alan Cox insisted on it in the RHEL
implementation).
I'd like to see handoff done by default, too. If you make it predicated
on the merge, so be it.
