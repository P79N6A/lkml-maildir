Well ... there's something going on that your posted dmesg's don't seem
to cover.  This:

Say everything went OK with DV and the drive attaches wide and at 10MHz.
But in your previous posting, the aic proc routines said this:

Which is the AIC driver's way of saying narrow async.
So something must have happened during the 1065 I/Os to cause this.
Hopefully that something left a trace in the logs.
