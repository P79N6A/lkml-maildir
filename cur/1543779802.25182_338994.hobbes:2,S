On a weird sidenote: my synaptics touchpad seems to not-like dyntick very much. 
When starting with a dyntick enabled kernel I get when psmouse.ko is loaded:
Aug  4 06:45:47 precious kernel: Synaptics claims to have extended capabilities, but I'm not able to read them.<3>Unable to initialize Synaptics hardware.
Aug  4 06:45:47 precious kernel: input: PS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio1
subsequently, X fails to start too (touchpad is set as corepointer)
reloading the module right then and there solves the problem:
Aug  4 06:47:47 precious kernel: Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1, fw: 5.8, id: 0x9d48b1, caps: 0x904713/0x4006
Aug  4 06:47:47 precious kernel: input: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio1
Also, booting the same (but non-patched) kernel gives me a clean boot:
Aug  4 06:56:42 precious kernel: Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1, fw: 5.8, id: 0x9d48b1, caps: 0x904713/0x4006
Aug  4 06:56:42 precious kernel: input: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio1
This is constantly reproducable for me. I guess some timing issue somewhere?
