It is possible, subsequent rounds of review should be near to each
other, but calling the code "new" is maybe exaggerate. I do not
remember all these TODOs but I may forget (and I don't have my box
right now, so I can't check).

That's fine. If this can help I could try to base next version
against -mm.

That's ok, I prefer reviews to testing right now. Almost all but 1
patch (which is marked) is unit tested on i386, x86_64 and uml (but
if I don't have a multithreaded concurrent fault tester), so it's
time to catch remaining bugs by review.

I'll try. I just hope we'll not have it next summer (I know it's my
problem, I'm not complaining on you).
Thanks!
