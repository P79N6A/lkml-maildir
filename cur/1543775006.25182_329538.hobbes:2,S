This wording _does_ imply that changes are lost if the file is mapped
writable and not mysnc'ed or if the memory mapping is anonymous.
In the former, changes are dropped and the file is reread from the stale
on-disk copy.  In the latter case, the data is dropped and the pages are
zero-filled on access.
