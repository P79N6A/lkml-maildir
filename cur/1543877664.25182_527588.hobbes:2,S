Which actually is true.  ATA ports failing to reset indicate something
is very wrong.  Either the attached device or the controller is broken
and libata shuts down the port to protect the rest of the system from
it.  The manual scan requests tell libata to give it one more shot and
polling hotplug can do that automatically.  Anyways, this shouldn't
happen unless you have a broken piece of hardware.

SCSI host scan nodes have been there for a long time.  I think it's
documented somewhere.
