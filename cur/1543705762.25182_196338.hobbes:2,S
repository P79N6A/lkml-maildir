Hi all,
I'm not all the list, please CC me.
Given the latest craze of thinking up imaginitive names for kernels, can we 
expect to see them appearing in /proc/version or perhaps /proc/alias anytime 
soon? May I also suggest "Offspring betwixt a Feisty Dunnart and a Geriatric 
Wombat" for the 2.6.3 release?
Thanks to everyone for such a great new kernel, you are all fantsactic.
Cheers,
Mark ( A Tux fan forever )
