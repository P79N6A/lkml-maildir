Sorry, Robin, I've not been following your patches.  But if you look
at 2.6.14-rc4-mm1, you'll find that there isn't even a get_one_pte_map
there.  Though there's no certainty yet that my pt locking changes, or
Nick's PageReserved changes, will actually go forward, there's a lot of
work queued up in -mm that is likely to affect your code.  And I don't
think exporting internal functions from mremap.c, _GPL or otherwise,
is the way to go.
Moving useful functions to a more central location might be.  But I'm
very dubious about your doing this kind of pte stuff deep down in an
architecture-specific driver.  You're not the only one interested in
this kind of functionality: we were thinking of providing it via an
alternative to the ->nopage method, which deals in pfns rather than
struct pages (I think that was wli's suggestion originally; Carsten
has an interest in it on s390, and I bet there are others).  There
may be excellent reasons why that wouldn't be good enough for you,
and your retcode method may be a better idea: I don't know yet.
Please rebase your work to 2.6.14-rc4-mm1 (but I won't get to look
at the result for a few days: perhaps others will).
The big question has to be: what are you expecting to happen for
PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE?
Hugh
