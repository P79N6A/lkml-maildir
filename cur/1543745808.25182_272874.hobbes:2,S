How about prototyping the API in user space, using a "mmap the block
device" based filesystem library?
You might also like to take a peek at
  
http://samba.org/ftp/unpacked/samba4/source/include/smb_interfaces.h
and 
  
http://samba.org/ftp/unpacked/samba4/source/ntvfs/ntvfs.h
those two files define the NTFS-like interfaces in Samba4. The
interface has proved to be quite flexible.

yep, I'm looking forward to experimenting with the "file is a
directory" stuff in reiser4 to see how well it can be made to match
what is needed for Samba4. 
Cheers, Tridge
