It is better to filter based on content. Neither method is really
accurate, but blocking all of rr.com is a major error. Block the
weird encodings, accept anything with "linux", etc.
The rr.com service is expanding across the US. It is a cable
service recently bought by AT&T. It serves areas without ISDN
or DSL, so the only alternative is a POTS modem. The rr.com
service is much cheaper and usually faster than ISDN and DSL.
So, expect more and more people to use the rr.com service.
It may grab a very large chunk of the US ISP market.
