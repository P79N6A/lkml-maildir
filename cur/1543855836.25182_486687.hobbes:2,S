Correct.  The generic version found in include/asm-generic/bitops/non-atomic.h
is not interrupt safe:
/**
 * __test_and_set_bit - Set a bit and return its old value
 * @nr: Bit to set
 * @addr: Address to count from
 *
 * This operation is non-atomic and can be reordered.
 * If two examples of this operation race, one can appear to succeed
 * but actually fail.  You must protect multiple accesses with a lock.
