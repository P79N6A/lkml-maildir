(oops, forgot to cc: the list)
Personally, I'm a little unhappy with the added complexity here, I'm
not convinced that this extra feature is worth it.  In particular,
adding to the address_space_operations, the block_device_operations,
and creating a new swap index/offset interface just for this seems
questionable.  I feel like interface bloat should be reserved for
features that have widespread use and benefit.
Not that I'm opposed to this feature, just that I think this patch is
too invasive interface-wise.
