Subject: [PATCH] FRV: Fix unannotated variable declarations
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/21/232

From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Fix unannotated variable declarations.  Variables that have allocation section
annotations (such as __meminitdata) on their definitions must also have them on
their declarations as not doing so may affect the addressing mode used by the
compiler and may result in a linker error.
