I believe it's in card drivers. I tried 'VGA' driver (that came with
XFree86) and console was ok.
With 'nv' driver (came with XFree86 4.0.1) console dims at first start and
in the second time it turns completely blank.
With 'nvidia' driber (v0.94, from NVidia) console blanks totally at first
start.
Another interesting point is that with 'nv' console dims only when starting
X (so I can restore console just by logging to another VT and 'reset', but
with 'nvidia' console blanks always when I switch to X.
