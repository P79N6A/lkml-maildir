Please take a moment to understand the Linux development process.
A better place to look would be 'ath5k' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-dev.git
but nonethless, the fact remains that ath5k is STILL NOT UPSTREAM and 
HAS NEVER BEEN UPSTREAM, as can be verified from
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
	(official linux repo; nothing is official until it hits here)
Part of the reason why ath5k is not upstream is that developers are 
actively addressing these copyright concerns -- as can be clearly seen 
by the changes being made over time.
So let's everybody calm down, ok?
Regards,
	Jeff
