I did. But when looking at the Oops output it seems to me that it is
get_free_page() that fails. If that is correct then it shouldn't matter
wether the call was made from grsecurity, should it? I thought
get_free_page would be succesful as long as I have free memory in
the system. I didn't post to lkml just to spam but because I thought that
it actually didn't matter that it happend in the grsecurity code.
Of course I could still be very wrong :-).
