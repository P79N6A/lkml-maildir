The Linux kernel right now relies on being in legacy mode at bootup.
So obviously kexec has to switch back to that.
Not relying on legacy mode would require moving APIC setup much earlier which
is difficult because that's quite fragile. Longer term it might be a good
idea though anyways -- at least the timer code was always fragile
and eliminating one failure case and only ever running it in true
APIC mode would be probably a good thing.
