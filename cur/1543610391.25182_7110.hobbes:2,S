What version of apmd? My says "apmd version 3.0final"
You might want to call IBM to check if there's a more recent bios upgrade
that you can get. Check for T21 at the IBM site below ...

+ThinkPad
Look for T21 under the device driver file matrices.
(Fix) Hang up occurs when suspend/resume is done on a ThinkPad
with HDD adapter without a hard disk drive in the ultrabay 2000.
(Fix) ACPI compatible Linux hangs up at boot timing.
My /usr/src/linux/.config ...
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
CONFIG_APM=m
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
# CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK is not set
# CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT is not set
# CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS is not set
# CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF is not set
I don't know whether the above will help or not, but it's worth a try.
