This may be somewhat related to something I've been thinking about
lately: The fact that most machines will choke under a simple UDP
while(1) sendto() attack (eg: around 100Mbit wire speed with lots of small
packets).  It seems that what's happening is a new packet comes in
immediately after the last interrupt is serviced (because the packets are
so small), so the CPU has no time to execute anything else and goes right
back into the interrupt handler.  This starves userspace CPU time.
Would your changes affect this at all?  It would be nice if this could
somehow be batched so that a Linux router could be capable of handling
large amounts of traffic with small packets, and wouldn't choke when lots
of small packets (most commonly from a TCP SYN bomb) go through it.
Actually, I just tested my while(1) sendto() UDP spamming program on an
Acenic card and noticed that it seems to do some sort of batching /
grouping, because the number of interrupts reported by vmstat is only
8,000 while it's easily 75,000 on other eepro100 boxes.  Interesting...
