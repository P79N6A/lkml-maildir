This is probably just bad luck and a known problem that I'm trying to 
fix (but hadn't have much time lately).
Can you try to change the line:
#define WORKING_SET		1024
in scripts/kallsyms.c to:
#define WORKING_SET		65536
and disable CONFIG_KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS, to see if the problem goes away?
It it does go away, then it is the same problem, and I'm working on it...
