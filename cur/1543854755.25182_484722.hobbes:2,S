I think Christoph was saying that it might reduce the size of the patch
to include it by _default_.  You could always go to the
weird^Wspecialized users and mask the bits back off.
We probably also need to start getting a nice list of those users which
are HIGH but not MOVABLE.  This would provide that by default, I think.
