And it is true.
It's not like a mess of 20 year old spaghetti assembly is a useful
starting point for anything.
I sat down and I read the relevant standards documents and what
chipset documentation there was and I manged to write code.
It's not like there is anything fundamentally hard about what bootstrap
firmware does.
Not to be insulting but disbelief here sounds a lot like SCO's assertion
that Linus couldn't written linux.
