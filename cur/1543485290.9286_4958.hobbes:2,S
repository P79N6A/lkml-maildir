Subject: Problems in kernel packet filtering code?

It looks to me like there are a few bugs lurking in the kernel packet
filtering code (net/core/filter.c and net/core/sock.c):
1) It allocates kernel memory thus:
	kmalloc(sizeof(struct sock_filter)*len, GFP_KERNEL)
   and frees it thus:
	kfree_s(old_filter, sizeof(struct sock_filter*) * sk->filter);
   Is this a memory leak? (sizeof(struct sock_filter) == 8)
2) The instructions are pulled from user space via a plain memcpy(), rather
   than copy_from_user().  Along the same lines, sk_chk_filter() checks the
   instructions without checking that it has been handed a valid address.
3) The bare htons() and htonl() calls in sk_run_filter() are likely problematic
   on big-endians.
