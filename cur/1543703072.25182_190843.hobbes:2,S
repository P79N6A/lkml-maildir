Why bother?  We can have userland code running before any device drivers
are initialized.  And have access to
	* all normal system calls
	* normal writable filesystem already present (ramfs)
	* normal multitasking
All of that - within the heavily tested codebase; regular kernel codepaths
that are used all the time by everything.  Oh, and it's portable.
What's the benefit of doing that from EFI?  Pure masochism?
