Subject: Quota files on root FS get "too large" error after 2.4.x upgrade

After installing and configuring kernel 2.4.0-test11, all is working well,
except quota's on the root FS.  I am at a loss as to how to correct this:
ls -l /quota.*
ls: /quota.group: Value too large for defined data type
ls: /quota.user: Value too large for defined data type
rm -f /quota.*
rm: cannot remove `/quota.group': Value too large for defined data type
rm: cannot remove `/quota.user': Value too large for defined data type
I have just started testing with the 2.4.x series kernel, so do not know if
this would have been seen in any previous testxx version.
