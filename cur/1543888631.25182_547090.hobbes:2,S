Interesting, sounds like it is still useful rather than just reading the
registers as the GTM/STM seem to survive resume cycles which drive config
may not (eg if the driver is loaded after a s2ram/resume.
If it just echoes back we should also be able to detect this by using
knowingly invalid values.
