Subject: [PATCH 1/2] mm: Fix overcommit overflow
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/30/427

Sami Farin reported an overflow in the overcommit handling on 64bit boxes.
We use atomic_t for page counting which is fine on 32bit but on 64bit
overflows. We can use atomic64_t but there is a problem - most heavy
users of zero overcommit are embedded people whose 64bit atomics are
really slow and expensive operations. Thus we use a few defines to flip
32 or 64bit according to the size of a long
(Split into two diffs to keep ownership correct)
