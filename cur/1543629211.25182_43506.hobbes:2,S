No, this is the way it was done a long time ago.
It turns out to be an incredibly bad idea.  In fact, it is the most CPU-efficient
way of guaranteeing the largest average seek times on your disks  ;)
The RAID-1 code now looks at which disk worked closest to the wanted position
last, and picks that disk for the seek.

The "new" code (which is not that new anymore) will allow one disk to keep
on a single sequential read for a long time (eventually it will kick in the
idle disk(s) though).
