If that coder has patent issues, it shouldn't be used, of course, 
regardless of performance.

Superior in most aspects, yes, but not regarding compression ratio. 
Anyway, calling bzip2 a step backwards was a bit of provocation and not 
really meant seriously, but it does have slightly reduced compression ratio.
Maybe bzip2 could be updated to make more use of today's fast CPUs? Much 
larger dictionary or other computationally expensive improvements.
