In theory yes. In practice it doesn't work that well ...

Experience teaches differently. For IO caches (and d/icache) strict local 
caching doesn't seem to be the best policy because it competes with more
important mapped memory too much.

iirc there is already a patch around for tmpfs to do that. But the 
interesting point here is what should be that default. And what
to do with the d/icaches by default.
