When resuming from a writeable filesystem, the filesystem has to match the 
contents of suspended memory.  If you've TOUCHED the filesystem since 
suspending, the resume is going to shred it, cross-link the heck out of it, 
and generally be evil.  (There are open filehandles saved in there, page 
table entries to maped stuff...  Just don't go there.)
