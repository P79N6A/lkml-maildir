Yes, that's even older than my tool.  But I don't think we want that
infrastructure inside the kernel.
 - there are lots of packaging systems
 - there even are lots of incompatible rpm versions
 - you really want to plug into some vendor-infrastructure, e.g.
   boot loader configuration
 - sooner or later I want to add some system to auto-apply patches
   (similar to what debian does)
