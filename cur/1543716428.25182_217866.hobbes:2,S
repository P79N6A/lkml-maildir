That agrees with what Martin Josefsson and i came across, we ended up
combing through the datasheet and ended up coming to the conclusion that
either we were missing something subtle or the hardware just didn't work.
It's a shame because i had a friend who had a whole bunch of these and
wanted to use the watchdog in production.
