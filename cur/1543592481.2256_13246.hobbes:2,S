yes , i am also not happy with IDE performance of Linux . That why i dont
use Hard disk in my Target machines ;)
When ever i copy big data (around 400 to 700 MB ) from one partion to
another my machine do not response at all (i can not work on another shell)
during data transfer.
Thank you ,
Best Regards,
Jaswinder.
