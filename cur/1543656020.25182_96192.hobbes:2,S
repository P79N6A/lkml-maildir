Hi,
having read an article about QoS and HTB in a German computer magazine I
wanted to implement such thing on my linux router running kernel 2.5.51.
First I patched the iproute2-020116.tar.gz package with the htb3.6_tc.diff 
from 
http://luxik.cdi.cz/~devik/qos/htb/
 and started building it. But
unfortunately it resulted in strange compile errors I do not understand.
Hope this is some help for you and I am not doing something terribly wrong.
Best regards,
Axel Siebenwirth
