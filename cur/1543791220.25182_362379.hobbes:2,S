The patches do ad a reasonable amount of complexity to the page allocator.  In 
my opinion that is the only downside of these patches, even though it is a big 
one.  What we need to decide as a community is if there is a less complex way to 
do this, and if there isn't a less complex way then is the benefit worth the 
increased complexity.
As to the non-zero performance cost, I think hard numbers should carry more 
weight than they have been given in this area.  Mel has posted hard numbers that 
say the patches are a wash with respect to performance.  I don't see any 
evidence to contradict those results.

I'd like to hear more details of how zones would be less complex while still 
solving the problem.  I just don't get it.
