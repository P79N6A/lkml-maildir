i know,  i'm a pessimist seeing things way too negatively. not trying to knock 
a guy senseless for his 3d suggestion, i just got carried away. sorry...
of course you wouldn't _need_ actual 3D code, so you can leave mesa out. it's 
just the issue of HW accel vs. software making things really hard to do 
without engineering a new DRI-like fb, it seems. and that new fb has other 
(ab)uses... one thing leads to another.
and what youre describing... that's quite like the hacked fb fullscreen splash 
code i'm suggesting. but i'm not realizing that a little code can draw a lot 
of things. thus it probably _could_ all fit in the kernel (except gfx) and 
run instantly (but only unitl init is through booting to the default 
runlevel, i hope?)
