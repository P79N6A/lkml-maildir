Hello!
   Debugging reiserfs problem that can be demonstrated with script created by
   Zygo Blaxell, I started to wonder if the problem presented is indeed reiserfs
   fault and not VFS.
   Though the Zygo claims script only produces problems on reiserfs, I am trying
   it now myself on ext2 (which will take some time).
   Debugging shows that reiserfs_link is sometimes called for inodes whose
   i_nlink is zero (and all corresponding data is deleted already).
   So my current guess of what's going on is this:
   process 1                      process 2
   sys_unlink("a/b")		  sys_link("a/b", "c/d");
   down(inode of ("a"));	  down(inode of "c");
   lock_kernel()
   reiserfs_unlink("a/b")
     decreases i_nlink of a/b to zero
     and removes name "b" from "a"
   unlock_kernel()
   d_delete("a/b")
(*)
				   lock_kernel()
				   reiserfs_link()
					at this point we do usual stuff,
					but inode's n_nlink is zero and
					file data already removed which
				        indicates reiserfs_delete_inode()
					was already called at (*)
				   unlock_kernel()
   So my question is "Is it really ok that sys_link/vfs_link does not
   take semaphore on parent dir of original path?", or should we
   actually put a workaround in reiserfs code to avoid such a situation?
Bye,
    Oleg
PS: Here's the script:
#!/bin/bash
# Create an empty filesystem:
mkreiserfs -f -f /dev/hdb2
mount /dev/hdb2 /data1 -t reiserfs
cd /data1
# Script used to control the load average.  Note that as written the loops
# below will keep spawning new processes, so we need some way to throttle
# them.  Change the '-lt 10' to another number to change the number
# of processes.
cat <<'LC' > loadcheck && chmod 755 loadcheck
#!/bin/sh
read av1 av5 av15 rest < /proc/loadavg
echo -n "Load Average: $av1 ... "
av1=${av1%.*}
if [ $av1 -lt 10 ]; then
        echo OK
        exit 0
else
        echo "Whoa, Nellie!"
        exit 1
