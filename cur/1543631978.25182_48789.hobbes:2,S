Well, the thing that makes me suspect of an hardware problem is that
with the very same kernel (and with ide0=ata66 option stupidly settet by
me for "using all hardware's power" and witch I have disabled from the
first problems I had) the pc worked happily from the 2.4.19-pre8 release
day till 3 or for days ago. In bios I've set PIO 4 && (U?)DMA 2. My
chipset is kx133 (mainboard: asus k7v-rm), CPU athlon 700 (not
overclocked) and the disk is a quantum 15Gb. I dont know what cabling is
used to connect the hd because I dont know to distinguish 80pin from
40pin. I've been using this hardware from 2 years and this is the first
"strange" problem. I've seen too that this problem happens expecialy in
massively writes to disk (for swapping ecc). Maybe this is useful:

If you need more information I'll be happy to give that.
Well, did I have to buy a new hd ? :)
