If crash handler registered
  stop the task and notify a registered user-space handler,
else
  dump core.
Crash handlers could be per-UID. They could listen on a device or
expect real-time (why call it that?) signals with data attached.
They could be full graphical GNOME apps that look up the maintainer
in an RPM database and offer to mail a form letter. The process
could be kept alive, which is more useful than a core. Someone with
a clue would get a chance to start up ddd on a live process, with
all the network connections intact.
Core files just aren't likely to generate useful bug reports.
Maybe 1% of the time someone submits a proper report.
