	Can I just add a me too here ?
	System: Abit BP6, Dual Celeron, Ne2k-pci, usb ohci and
	scanner; 128 Mb Ram, Nvidia TNT2 graphics. Kernel 2.4.5
	After scanning a couple of images (scanner is a Mustek 1200cu)
	using Xsane, the system simply hangs. All network connectivity
	dies, and the system basically stops responding. I can switch
	consoles, and maybe log in[1], but that's basically it.
	Debugging this is a bit beyond me, but it is fairly
	reproducible, so let me know what I need to do to provide
	useful information (The system is not critical, though I'd
	prefer not to break it)
	Sorry, no logs.. 
	TimT.

I've been doing a lot of abstract painting lately, extremely
abstract. No brush, no paint, no canvas, I just think about it.
