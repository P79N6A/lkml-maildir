Odd: this machine seems to be using swap, albeit not very much (and I've
got the swap priorities upside down, as well; whoops, that's probably
been harming performance for, well, years):
Filename				Type		Size	Used	Priority
/dev/sda2                               partition	523016	0	1
/dev/sda4                               partition	511232	57648	2
/dev/sdb2                               partition	523016	0	1
Is the problem that the higher-priority kicking out to swap which should
happen when memory is tight, won't?

... since it kicks in eventually anyway.

That's a question that's very hard to answer until we know the cause of
this failure and can fix it: then we can go through the RTL or assembler
dumps of a kernel compilation and comb more potential problems out
(or not: it's probably a long and thankless task).
I'll build rmap.c with GCC-3.3 later tonight (if I can find a copy on my
old backups), compare the generated code, and see if anything leaps out
at me.
