Sure, I'll grep for cancel_delayed_work(). But unless I missed something,
this change should be completely transparent for all users. Otherwise, it
is buggy.

Yes. But otoh, try_to_del_timer_sync() is a waste of CPU compared to del_timer(),
when the timer is not pending.

two alternate steps.
1 means
	if (try_to_cancel_delayed_work())
		schedule_delayed_work();
2 means
	cancel_delayed_work();
	schedule_delayed_work();

Yes. But lock_timer_base() is more costly.

No, delayed_work_timer_fn() doesn't set the _PENDING flag.

Sure, the implementation of try_to_cancel_delayed_work() above is just for
illustration. I don't think we need try_to_cancel_delayed_work() at all.

First, this is very unlikely event, delayed_work_timer_fn() is very fast unless
interrupted.
_PENDING flag won't be cleared until this work is executed by run_workqueue().
In generak, work_pending() after del_timer() is imho better way to avoid the
unneeded schedule_delayed_work().
But again, I can't undertand the win for that particular case.
