Preventive measures are taken to limit only one continuation inode per 
file per chunk. This can be done easily in the chunk allocation 
algorithm for disk space. Although I'm not quite sure what you mean by 
"Delete file in chunk A". If you are referring to same file thats 
growing, then deletion is not possible, because individual parts of any 
file in any chunk cannot be deleted.
