Ok, I was ignorant of the arp filter functionality in 2.2. I found an old
(probably painfully out-of-date) posting the patch Andi Kleen was referring to
in the archive, but I've not used it.

Indeed, the default behavior does cause problems in a router environment, but
this only happens when multiple nics are on the same subnet; in a 'true' router
each nic would be on a separate subnet. Regardless, I personally use FreeBSD
when I need a router (Horrors! ;)
What I meant by load sharing was implicit sharing rather than explicit sharing;
when an ARP request comes the reply the host gets may have the MAC address of
NICs other than the one explicitly bound to the given IP-- thus different hosts
will semi-randomly get different MAC addresses and thus send to different NICs;
this implicit sharing completely hoses explicit load sharing.
And as for fault tolerance, here's what happened to me, as I mentioned in
another message: We have a 8-node cluster with 2 nics, a eepro and a gig-e
acenic in each node. A while back the acenic driver had some problems and would
silently fail after a while; the arp reponse behavior allowed the cluster to
remain 'up' long enough to finish the jobs we assigned to it (although
performance sucked since all traffic went over the eepros). After we were done,
we could ifdown/ifup the interfaces and all was good. Again, this is a sort of
'implicit' fault tolerance, rather than a more explicit form where the card goes
down, we get some sort of notification, and it fails over to the other card
explicitly.

Well, Yes, but that's not really the issue. The problem is 'what is the proper
*default* behavior of the Linux ARP subsystem'... this code changes it, which is
probably more of a political than technical decision. Where you (and I) see
'broken' others see 'feature' :/
