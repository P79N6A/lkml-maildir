I agree, and I do agree that it's a real difference. 
I personally think that it's the "aggregation" issue, not a "derivation" 
issue, but I'll freely admit that it's just my personal view of the 
situation.

Yes. There is not doubt at all that regardless of anything else, if you 
link statically, you at the VERY LEAST need to have the right to 
distribute the library as part of an "aggregate work".

Yes. And I have actually talked about this exact issue - even in the 
absense of any "derivation" from the library, the fact that static linking 
includes a _copy_ of the library does mean that you have to have the right 
to distribute that particular copy. 
Now, under the GPL, aggregate distribution is allowed, but you still do 
need to follow the other GPL rules (ie you would need to distributed 
sources for the library - even if you don't necessarily distribute sources 
to the binary you linked _with_).
So there's no question that "dynamic linking" simplifies issues, by virtue 
of not even distributing any library code at all. I absolutely agree about 
that part.
