Such problems get researched, and warnings such as the one in
my patch get added. Take a look through smpboot.c and friends.
We support a lot of broken hardware, but there's a difference between
broken (buggy) and running something outside of its specification.

The reason we have DMI table scanning on boot up.

Another unsupported configuration we should at least warn about.
Note however, that some quad systems allow 2 different pairs.

The reason memtest86 came to be.

See errata workarounds in smpboot.c & setup.c

Running underrated PSUs on modern hw is asking for trouble.
Unless you think AMD approved PSUs are another marketing gimmik
to make people pay out more.

Sure. And this eliminates one such variable.
