Sure, the pages are reserved, but we still map them into the kernel
address space.

Actually, the comment above __VMALLOC_RESERVE already says "This much
address space is reserved for vmalloc() and iomap() as well as fixmap
mappings.", so it should have already been taken into account there.
So, please revert this.  When we introduce an actual CONFIG_MEMORY hole,
we'll patch in an explicit "-MEMHOLE_SIZE" or something here.

You wouldn't have noticed, yes.  But I'm not convinced the "fix" was
right anyway.
Thanks for chasing this!
