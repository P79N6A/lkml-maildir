You do not have the sr_mod module loaded; thus /dev/scsi/<address>/
only contains the "generic" device node, not the "cdrom" block device
node.
Either load sr_mod from a startup script (/etc/rc.modules comes to
mind), or set up the devfs module autoloader appropriately.
The device to be used for mounting is /dev/scsi/<address>/cdrom, not
/dev/scsi/<address>/generic. The generic device is "only" used for
special-purpose commands, such as for scanners or CD writing. Those
special commands are not block-level, thus "generic" is a character
device.
So long,
