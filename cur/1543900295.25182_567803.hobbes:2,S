Subject: [PATCH][RFC] 4K stacks default, not a debug thing any more...?

Hi,
I'm wondering if it's time to make 4K stacks the default and to start 
considering removing the 8K stack option alltogether soon?
One of the big problem spots was XFS, but that got some stack usage 
fixes recently, and the 4K stack option has been around for quite a 
while now, so people really should have gotten around to fixing any 
code that can't handle it.   Are there still any big problem areas 
remaining?
As a starting point, something like the patch below that makes 4K 
stacks default and make them no longer depend on DEBUG_KERNEL 
could be the way to go. Then after a while of this being in effect we 
could remove the option of a 8K stack alltogether.
What say you?
