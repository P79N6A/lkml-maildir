And as I wrote earlier, this patch doesn't only improve output,
it also _reuses_ code, i.e. __print_symbol() which your code recreates
in printk_address().  Now printk_address() reuses the common __print_symbol().
One very important thing this patch also does is that it prints the offsets
in hexadecimal, as opposed to decimal.  I.e. from
0xNNNNNNNN+DDD to 0xNNNNNNNNN+0xTTT/0xWWW
As to "less space", this patch prints _identical_ information as the code
before it, as I'm sure you can see by reading the patch itself.
Thanks,
