It's the same tool architecture used with PCI:  modules.pcimap
(and now modules.isapnpmap) also come from MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE
entries.  Modutils 2.3.19+ required.

The "no additional config files" is what's new in test10.
Before, handcrafted /etc/usb/drivers/* scripts were used;
great as proof-of-concept, lousy to maintain as the primary
way to handle driver hotplugging.

My bad ... thanks for that one-liner, and the driver updates
to make more USB drivers use this new "modutils" support!

For the benefit of LKML readers who don't read Linux-USB-devel,
see 
http://www.linux-usb.org/policy.html
 for an overview (not
updated yet to reflect 2.4.0-test10).  Scripts are in CVS:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/usbd/etc/?cvsroot=linux-usb
You can make this work with just "hotplug" (called by kernel)
and "policy" (handling USB-specific driver selection).  That
"hotplug" script should eventually handle other types of bus.
The USB "policy" script uses "modules.usbmap", but will fall back
to /etc/usb/drivers scripts, which you should NOT have if you're
trying to test "modules.usbmap" support in a driver.  (If you
just want to use this not debug it, you want those scripts.)
With the USB driver updates I've already seen, it looks like an
upcoming 2.4 kernel may no longer need those driver scripts; not
sure about the 2.2 backports though.
