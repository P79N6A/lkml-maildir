Your understanding of the problem on ARM remains fundamentally flawed.
I see no way to resolve this since you don't seem to listen or accept
my reasoning.
Therefore, message I'm getting from you is that we are not allowed to
have an ARM system which can possibly work correctly with PIO.
As a result, I have no further interest in trying to resolve this issue,
period.  ARM people will just have to accept that PIO mode IDE drivers
just will not be an option.
Thanks.
