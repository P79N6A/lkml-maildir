The basic difference between a pty and tty is that a pty connects to a
program (that created it by opening the ptmx node, for example xterm or
ssh) on the other end, while a tty connects to the kernel doing all the
character drawing in the framebuffer.
You can't easily use one instead of the other, they're very different
beasts.
Of course, a way to use a pty would be to have the console
implementation in userspace.
The fact that no program is on the other end of a tty is also the reason
why they cannot be created dynamically like ptys, there is noone to open
a "ttmx" to create the ttys.
Hence, the device nodes are pre-created by the kernel, while the real
devices are only created on open.
