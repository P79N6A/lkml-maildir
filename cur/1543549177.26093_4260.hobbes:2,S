	Looking in the old kernels, it seems the binary compatibility
was broken in 2.3.21 when si_code returns POLL_xxx events just like
mentioned in "The Single UNIX ® Specification, Version 2",
xsh/signal.h.html and not SI_SIGIO.
	SI_SIGIO in si_code for 2.2 does not return any information
about the events. I even see that Redhat maintains patch against 2.2
to backport the POLL_xxx events from 2.3. Not sure after the changes
in 2.4.0-test1. Anyway, 2.2 looks unusable for me and I don't see other
way this problem to be fixed. The binary compatibility is impossible
to exist. The applications can support the both ways: the old SI_SIGIO
and the new POLL_xxx events (recompiled after test1) in si_code.
	The next step is somebody to implement event merging and to
allow receiving of many events with one call. For the next kernels.
