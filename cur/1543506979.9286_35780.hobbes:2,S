I did experiment with this a long time ago.  The result was that flushing
is better for every data object larger than one or two cachelines.  The
limit also depends a bit of the size of cachelines and overhead of the
cacheflushing code.
The number is so low because uncached writes to memory will on most
architectures bypass the writebuffer and other optimizations resulting
in some penalty.

There isn't a portable way to get uncached memory.  But GFP_UNCACHED
sounds good.
