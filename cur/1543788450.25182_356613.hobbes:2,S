you, however, seem to be missing the point that these are special 
circumstances. in 99% of all cases, regular unix file permissions are 
sufficient. when you start needing special silly permissions for things 
like this, we have special silly tools to accommodate you. Use them. 
Deal with it.
adding a permissions schema similar to that found in windows/netware 
would only unneccessarily complicate things, and most likely end up 
breaking everything.
bottom line: if you want to see support like this in linux, write a 
filesystem with these capabilities built-in. If you don't want to/can't 
write it, then stop complaining and continue to use netware (read: shit 
or get off the pot).
