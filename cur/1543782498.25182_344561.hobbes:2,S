But... I got complains about atomic_read(&counter) being 'an atomic op' 
(untrue), so my second patch just doesnt touch the path where nr_files was read.
Furthermore, a lazy sync would mean to change sysctl proc_handler for 
"file-nr" to perform a synchronize before calling proc_dointvec, this would be 
really obscure.

You mean :
atomic_inc(&counter);
lazeyvalue = atomic_read(&counter);
instead of
lazeyvalue = atomic_inc_return(&counter);
In fact I couldnt find one architecture where the later would be more expensive.
