Not to get off topic here but there will be a
need to do, at least, some of what acpid now
does (AML-wise) in the kernel in the future.
To support features like suspend to disk, some
interpretation will have to be done in-kernel.

Actually, I think unification of acpid and apmd
would be good.  True, with its AML interpreter,
acpid would be a bulk of the binary right now but
I forsee that diminishing and acpid containing the
same amount of functionality as apmd.  Unification
would be nice from the user/install perspective.
