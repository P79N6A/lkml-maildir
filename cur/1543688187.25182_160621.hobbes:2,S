Dear Erik and Jeff,
Did you make any progress here or were you discouraged by the resulting
flamewar?
Does this work in 2.4.x?  I have a Tyan Trinity i875P S5101 which I want to
use the parallel IDE ports on.  They are connected to a PDC20378.  Any
patches that you think would be reliable?  Or should I take the opportunity
to return this to the vendor and buy an Intel S845WD1-E instead?
