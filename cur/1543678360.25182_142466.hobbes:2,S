No, the build system is OK.  And ccache nicely fixes up any mistakes which
the build system makes, and distcc speeds things up by 2x to 3x.
None of that gets around the fact that code needs to be tested with various
combinations of CONFIG_SMP, CONFIG_PREEMPT, different subarchitectures,
spinlock debugging, etc, etc.  If the compiler is slow people don't bother
doing this and the code breaks.
Cause and effect.
