Agreed. Note that on the transmit side, 1 bit time between chars is 
unacceptable - 3 character times (33 bits) is the time we must leave _between_ 
packets. There must be no gaps inside the packet itself.

Yes, possibly - and turn them back on again as soon as you leave the 
certification lab :) We can get it to work without this.
Bear in mind that Profibus has a set list of baud rates at which it can work, 
and of those, I believe only 9600 and 19200 are actually achievable with the 
standard clocks and divisors which we'll find in a PC.
Interrupt latency can be 11 bits @19200 - over half a millisecond. (We have 11 
bits because the IRQ is generated when the last octet is _started_).
So I'm not too worried about meeting these requirements - it should be fine. 
By all means, push to find out the cause of Rogier's 20ms delays, which are 
concerning, but don't worry about the serial side too much on my behalf until 
I've actually got time to throw some code together and can give some real 
numbers.
Like I said, I only got involved at this stage because someone else was asking 
about such things.
