To reach this path you need to run the equivalent of:
ip link set eth0 name eth1
I have seen this a bit and my memory is that the error is generally
harmless.  It is trying to create a symlink with the same name as the
directory or something like that.  Which makes with one setting of
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED but not the other.
So I don't believe this is a driver bug, and I suspect the renames
come from using something like /etc/mactab which forces ethernet
devices with specific mac addresses to specific ethernet device
names.
With whatever is sitting in my development tree I'm pretty certain
this error isn't present.  I don't recall if I did anything specific
to fix this though.  In particular I don't recall if this still
happens with gregkh's queued sysfs patches applied.
