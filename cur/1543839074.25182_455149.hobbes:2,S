Providing that a judge doesn't rule otherwise in court based on local
laws. And judges rule (most of the time) also based on common sense
(e.g. if you buy a copy-protected music CD/DVD and you cannot play it on
an ordinary CD/DVD player, the CD/DVD is "broken" and must be replaced
by the shop where you bought it or you get your money back returning the
defective CD/DVD).
And yes, there are (lots of other) issues you can't legally remove with
any disclaimer (at least in .at - and probably more continental European
countries).

If you tamper with the product "as you like" (read: in unintended ways,
not through officially available interfaces, etc.), there are IMHO
(in .at) no disclaimers necessary - the producer has no responsibility
any more from the moment you start tampering.
