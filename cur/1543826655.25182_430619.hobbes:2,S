This is my biggest problem or maybe my complete lack of understanding, is
that I don't know how to determine what state I am in during a hotplug
event, either a cpu removal or a suspend.  Therefore I feel like I have to
store some persistant data around _just_ in case this is a suspend event.
Also at the opposite end, how to separate a cpu insert vs. a cpu resume.
The different being initialize to a global state vs. initialize to a last
known state.  
I thought it would make more sense if a few more states were to the
hotplug event list.  For example, in addition to CPU_ONLINE and CPU_DEAD,
there could also be something like CPU_SUSPEND, CPU_FREEZE, CPU_RESUME,
and CPU_THAW.  
Anyway, I am probably complicating the matter.  I'll whip something up and
post it for review.
Cheers,
Don
