On a related issue, if there was a char generic_data[] member in the inode
union that had a defined size (probably the size of the largest structure),
people (like me) writing filesystems that aren't ready to be put into the
sources yet could put data right in the union and know that it will fit
without having to resort to using generic_ip and allocating an info block
to store inode specific info.  (Narly sentence huh?)
