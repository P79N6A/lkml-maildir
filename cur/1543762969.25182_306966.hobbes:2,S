Hello All:
I have a problem mounting a Win2k Server shared folder in linux.
mount -t smbfs -o username=leo,codepage=cp850,iocharset=iso8859-1 
//<servername/d$ /mnt/pt
The part is mounted successfully after having entered a password.
The problem is that several accented characters (not all of them) appear 
incorrectly.
AFAIK Á, ã, õ appear as A, a, o when listed.
á,é, í, ó, ú , à .. ù, ç all appear correctly.
When listing files explicitly that contain the incorrect characters an 
error message like _file not found_ is returned (logical since in fact 
the files is named differently)
The real kicker is that smbclient's ftp-like interface displays the 
characters correctly. 
the kernel (2.6.11-r5 on gentoo) uses iso-8859-1 as it's default nls 
character set though the smbfs module doesn't define a default nls for 
itself.
I've already tried cp860  (same results)
I've already sent a message to the samba boys and I was refered to you 
good folk.
Any suggestions?
Thanks in advance,
Leo
