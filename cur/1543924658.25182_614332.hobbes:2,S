Well, the 32-bit code needs to set up its own stack, and only it knows 
where it wants its stack; we don't guarantee that the stack is valid 
when we enter the 32-bit code and we're entering with both INT and NMI 
disabled (requiring a stack would probably break all existing users of 
the 32-bit entrypoint.)
However, that being said, doing so is trivial, and it might help some 
debugging hack; anything that makes debugging easier is a Good Thing[TM].
