This would help X, but regardless mp3 playing should not skip. I think its
giving newly forked children much too high a priority. Basically new 
children
can't get less than 50% sleep time, which is stupid on my behalf because a
program which continually forks children that do a little bit of work then
exit would basically be at 50% sleep time when it should be at or close 
to 0.
