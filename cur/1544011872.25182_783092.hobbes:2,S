In which case you've gotten further than most of us. Ricoh are not an
helpful vendor so getting their hardware up and running is always an
uphill battle.
sdhci was the result of reverse engineering yes, but that is hardly
relevant here as it is not a ricoh interface but a standardised one.
The fixes in ricoh_mmc were based on information received from an OEM,
not from Ricoh directly.
So right now I'd say reverse engineering is your only option if you
want to support that piece of hardware.
