Hello,
I had some serious crash today originated by a reiserfs 3.5.32 on 2.2.19 which
panic'd telling me something with inodes is wrong. Unfortunately the msg was
only to see on the screen and I didn't write it down. So I decided to update to
3.5.34 and give it a try, again. Now I see the following during normal
operation:

What does this mean? What should be done? Does this fs survive, or am I to
reformat?
Regards,
Stephan
