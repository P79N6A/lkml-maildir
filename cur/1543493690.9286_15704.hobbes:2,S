	Currently (ever ?) you don't.
	Yes, that limitation is nuisance, very least.
	Is it just an *implementation* limitation, or really
	a fundamental *design* item, that I can't say.  Braam ?
	If it is just an implementation issue, and nothing in the
	fundamental Venus/Vice protocol design prevents doing partial
	file access (although offline use of the file would likely be
	impossible in that case), then it is "just" a matter of
	getting suitable design for the re-engineering of Venus,
	and Vice, and doing the grunt work.
	Of course a good question in handling such giga-files is,
	is Coda really the right tool ?
