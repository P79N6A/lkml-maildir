- Recursive makes can be made much faster too.
- Believe me when I say _much_ faster ;-)
- `find' can be used to speed up recursive makes
- but for a really big project the `find' time still dominates overall build
  time.  (Like _20 minutes_ to find all the changed files in a source
  tree -- my fault for having 200,000 sources I guess ;-)
