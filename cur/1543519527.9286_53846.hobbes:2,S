This says that you did a control msg read/INput,
requesting 4 bytes, and 0 bytes were actually read
from the device (i.e., the device sent 0 bytes, not 4).
I don't see how this would have anything to do with
the registers being modified.  Wouldn't that usually
be done with a control pipe write/OUTput message?
usb_bulk_msg() is a synchronous I/O function.  It
waits until I/O complete (or timeout) to return to
your driver.  usb_request_bulk() is an async I/O
request.  Your driver will continue execution
immediately after the I/O to your device has been
setup.  For any decent performance, I expect that
you would want to use usb_request_bulk().
usb_request_bulk() returns a void * ("handle")
which can be used to cancel/terminate your I/O
request by calling usb_terminate_bulk(device, handle).
Since your driver could have several I/Os outstanding,
you pass a context field to usb_request_bulk()
and in your driver's callback function, that context
value is passed back to you.
BTW, linux-usb has a web site (www.linux-usb.org) and
a mailing list (linux-usb@suse.com).
