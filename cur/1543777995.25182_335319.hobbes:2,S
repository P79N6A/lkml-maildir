jiffies isn't set in that function.  The value of jiffies is modded by
128.  Since jiffies is a volatile value, the value of n is usually
different on each call of that function.  This value is used to pick an
eraseblock to garbage collect out of a series of different lists.  This
is done to help with effective wear leveling of flash eraseblocks.
