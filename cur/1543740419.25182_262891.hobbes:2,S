My aside from the DVD bit, my original 2D concept would make all of that 
possible.
So, say you decide that you want to use this card for some obscure 
variant of BSD or an Amiga or something, and you're having some trouble 
with the porting of the available drivers, I'd be happy to assist in 
that process.

A CPU and a GPU don't do the same things.  A GPU naturally parallelizes 
things, both in time (pipelining of rendering functions) and space 
(multiple pipelines).  A CPU, even a superscalar one, does things in 
essentially a sequential fashion.  Thus, a 200Mhz GPU will absolutely 
cream your 1Ghz G4 in graphics performance, even WITH clever AltiVec 
hacks.  Dedicated hardware is ALWAYS going to be faster than doing it in 
  software.
That being said, I'm not rejecting your G4 idea out-right.  While you 
can't expect stellar performance out of it, you CAN program it to do 
absolutely every kind of 3D rendering you want.
I'm going to propose this as a possible solution to the problem.
