It depends on what programs you run.  Emacs runs perfectly fine over a
slow modem.  Firefox is usually very unhappy even on a fast LAN.  In
general, applications that render an image locally and send that to
the X server for display will run badly over a remove connection.
Apps that send text and drawing commands to the server, and let it
take care of rendering run quite well.

RDP is more like VNC, AFAIK.  It serves a different purpose.
