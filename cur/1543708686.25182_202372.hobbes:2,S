I don't know if it's strictly needed, but it's not the hard part of this
particular issue (as I suggested in another thread, remove_all_break()
on a ? packet works).

I don't think this is that hard of a problem anymore.  I haven't enabled
console messages, but I've got the following being happy now:
- Connect to a waiting kernel, continue/^C/disconnect/reconnect.
- Connect to a running kernel, continue/^C/disconnect/reconnect.
- Once connected and running, ^C/hit breakpoint and
  disconnect/reconnect.
- Once connected, set a breakpoint, kill gdb and hit the breakpoint and
  reconnect.
- Once connected and running, kill gdb and reconnect.
The last two aren't as "fast" as I might like, but they're the "gdb went
away in an ungraceful manner" situations, so I think it's OK.  In the
first (breakpoint hit, no gdb) I end up having to issue a few continues
to get moving again, but it's a one-time event.  For the last one, there's
2 packet instead of ACKs, then a NAK, but I believe this is acceptable.
