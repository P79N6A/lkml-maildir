It's not impossible, though, that this tied-ness could be organized into
one or perhaps 2-3 kernel<->driver interface specifications.  If you
change stuff that breaks compatibility with driver spec version X, you
increment the version so that old drivers can decide to refuse to load.
When a driver says "I'm too old for this kernel", one knows immediately
that it's time for someone (possibly one's self) to go get interface spec.  
versions X and X+1 and see what has to be changed.

A Brazil-nut is neatly packaged and tightly integrated.  To turn it into
food, you must crack and remove the shell.  I find that I feel the same   
way about an increasing number of software products.  *sigh*
