Sorry but this isn't my program you're describing --
My program (killmem.c, attached) doesn't recurse.
It allocates (in a loop) lots of memory in 4MB chunk mmaps. (1GB total)
It then fills each chunk one at a time until it dies.
This demonstrates the ability to allocate far more memory than is
available, and subsequently die when accessing it. This is overcommit,
even when overcommit is turned off.
Allocating memory in a single 1GB chunk fails gracefully, but allocating
in 4MB chunks works until you access it.
