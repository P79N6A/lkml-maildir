And maybe the resister set too and map some library to fully utilize
the DSP chip in these modern cards.
The current ALSA and /dev/dsp conventions can't really respect the
complexity of 3D psychoacoustics modeling through DSP trickery in it's
current form. That might have changed, since I haven't seen ALSA in
about a month or so.
Just reading the EAX SDK stuff make that pretty clear.
