To me that says "compiler on crack". I don't see why a register couldn't 
be rw. After all, it clearly can be read, and written to, and gcc does 
explicitly mention the '&' modifier in the documentation.
But maybe Richard has some input on what has happened, and can explain the 
compiler side of it.. Richard?
