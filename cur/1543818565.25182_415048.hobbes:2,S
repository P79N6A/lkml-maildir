Oh, probably I missed something. But as I can see it, MT exec can never succeed!
Once again. Process starts exec, it has no pending signals. Execer thread sets
SIGNAL_GROUP_EXEC, sends SIGKILL to other threads, and waits them to die.
The first thread which dequeues SIGKILL will change SIGNAL_GROUP_EXEC to
SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT, thus aborting exec.
Sorry for persistance if I really misunderstand this patch.
