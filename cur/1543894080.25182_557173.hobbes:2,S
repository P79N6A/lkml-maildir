Where is the boundary between hard- and software? I'm employed as hardware 
designer, and for this purpose, I write programs in a hardware description 
language, which can be converted into hardware through a synthesis 
software. I write firmware, which is assembled into binary and gets placed 
on on-chip memory (ROM or NVM). I've even studied computer science, and 
electric engineering was just a side-course. I know how transistors work, 
and how gates are implemented in terms of transistors, but in essense, it's 
not that relevant unless you want to do analog circuits. Usually, during 
the development phase, we put the Verilog into an FPGA, where the 
configuration file still is obviously "software" in any sense it can be. 
I've even released descriptions of some parts of the work I do under GPL 
for people to put it into their own FPGAs.
There is no boundary between hard- and software in the sense of that 
hardware is something fundamentally different. Hardware is just another way 
to implement programs, and it uses other languages (but SystemC even looks 
quite close to C). If there is a boundary, it's way below the distinction 
between a Tivo and a PC, because these two basically consist of a 
processor, some RAM, some flash, a harddisk, and a video driver.
What's true: We don't have the moral power to define *where* the software 
goes, but we have the moral power to define *how* users can change the 
software when they own the hardware (the physical representation).
