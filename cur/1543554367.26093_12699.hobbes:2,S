I've actualy seen this with a bunch of NFS clients idle, and sendmail stops
delivering email until the load average drops.  What's of more concern is
the intense VM implementation Rik has done -- it's a great piece of work,
but it appears when heavy swapping is going on, sendmail also stops 
delivering email as well.
