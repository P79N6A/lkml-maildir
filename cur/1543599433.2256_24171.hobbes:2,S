I did.. I'll make clean and recompile the kernel again, just in case. 
But still: why complain about mount ? Why allow to mount a partition ?
I do not think this is the cause (also see below).

You were right about networking. It turns out that I can ping just fine 
when the packet size is 5524 and under (with header 5532). When I ping 
with size 5525 and above (with header 5533) no packets (at all !) get
thru. Pinging localhost goes fine. None of the machines on my local
network can ping with sizes about 5525. Using tcpdump shows that packets
do arrive on the interface. Setting wsize and rsize to 5000 helped - thank
you very much ! I guess that between 2.4.7 and 2.4.9 the default rsize and
wsize went up.
Now I am wondering what is wrong with large udp packets ? (my mtu is 
1500 and they do get chopped up in smaller packets, but so do size
5524). Any ideas ?
                  thanks !
