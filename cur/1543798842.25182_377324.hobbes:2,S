I doubt you can guarantee that statement, or has the kernel source
been audited for this recently?
However, the real consideration is stability - if a semaphore was
used for a completion and it was merged, would it be found and
fixed?  Probably not, because it won't cause any problems on
architectures where semaphores have atomic properties.  Unless
of course sparse can be extended to detect the use of unbalanced
semaphores in interrupt contexts.

Balancing the elimination of 4 instructions per semaphore operation,
totalling about 4 to 6 cycles, vs stability I'd go for stability
unless we can prove the above assertion via (eg) sparse.
