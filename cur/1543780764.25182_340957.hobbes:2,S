Actually, inter-reference distance is what triggers whether the
active list gets scanned in addition to the inactive list.
The inter-reference distance also determines on which list a
page gets allocated.
I agree the code probably needs tweaking in this respect, though.

I'm not surprised!
If a page is not frequently enough accessed to be on the active
list, chances are it could still be accessed more frequently than
many pages on the inactive list, and evicting the page is the
wrong thing to do.
I suspect that ARC and CAR/CART are more suited for databases
than for general purpose OSes.  The reason databases are
probably different is that databases tend to have large indexes,
which are accessed more frequently than most data.  This may
lead to a stricter "separation" between hot and cold pages.

Agreed - I really am not sure how to properly test replacement
algorithms.
