Subject: [patch] trivial doc patch for partitions

It's slightly hard to see how these variables are used; this patch
adds a short description.
I am planning to change rescan_partitions so that it allows you to
change partitions on a disk that has active partitions, so long as the
active partitions themselves are not changed.  Would anyone object?
