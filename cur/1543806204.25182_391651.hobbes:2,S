It certainly does return something useful, just not what you are looking 
for.  It does not return information that allows you to cleanly build 
your bus:device:lun view of the world, but it does return sufficient 
information to enumerate and communicate with all devices in the 
system.  Is that not sufficient to be able to implement cdrecord?  If it 
is, then the real issue here is that you want Linux to conform to the 
bus:device:lun world view, which it seems many people do not wish to do. 
Maybe it would be more constructive if you were to make a good argument 
for why the bus:device:lun view is better than /dev/*, but right now it 
seems to me that they are just two different ways of doing the same 
thing, and you prefer one way while the rest of the Linux developers 
prefer the other.
