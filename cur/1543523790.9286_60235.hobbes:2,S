On my kit running 2.3.40 it "works" compiled in.  "works" as in 10Mb
only.  Does your card negotiate 100Mb succesfully when installed as a
module ?  
I have an Accton 1207D Cheetah which negotiates properly under Win98 but
(weirdly) lights up both the 10 and 100 TX LEDs under Linux.
Perhaps using rtl8139-diag (src attached - tail <relevant .c file> for
compile instructions) will provide you with more pointers (it didn't for
me, but YMMV)
I queried Donald Becker, but he hasn't come back to me yet.
