Jaswinder reported a similar crash.
Mike, Rusty, what's going on with this commit? Why does this code:
+       if (cpumask_any_but(&mm->cpu_vm_mask, smp_processor_id()) < nr_cpu_ids)
+               flush_tlb_others(&mm->cpu_vm_mask, mm, TLB_FLUSH_ALL);
Assume that mm->cpu_vm_mask wont change? TLB flushes go async and the MM's 
schedulability is not locked during that. I.e. mm->cpu_vm_mask can change 
under you while the TLB flush IPIs are flying around - while when the 
cpumask was passed on-stack this wouldnt happen.
