Hmm.. yet another advantage of that URL->few-file-fragment cache for the
khttpd: one of the fragments could contain a Date: header changed by a
master httpd every few seconds to be reasonably up-to-date.  Poof --
here goes the need for a kernel date formatting routine :) [Hmmmm.. this
could also be used by the "normal" apache itself?] The rest of the
fragments could be: 1: rest of the static headers; 2: rest of the static
file. (not in this 0-1-2 order of course, probably in 1-0-2)
