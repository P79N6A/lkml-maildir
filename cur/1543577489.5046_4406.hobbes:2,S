Many newer cell phones, even low spec ones, will have a software
power switch (usually with a hardware override after about 5 seconds
of continuous press).  There are many other concessions that need to
be made to power efficiency, like the ability to toggle power to even
very minor peripherals and chips (not only each CPU and DSP, but the bus
controllers and UARTs connecting things together).  These things sell
in the millions, so their designers can easily budget the custom logic.
