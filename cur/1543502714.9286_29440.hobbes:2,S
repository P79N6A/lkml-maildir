So we gradually let the project die under the weight of years of accumulated
cruft instead? This is, after all, part of the problem MS are having with
Windows. It's good to clear out (some of the) cruft in a major revision; if you
don't like it then may I kindly point you at 2.2.10, or 2.0.37, or 1.2.13.
It's not like we're removing syscalls or ioctls or breaking function semantics
here (indeed, AIUI we'll be *fixing* some syscall semantics). Any program which
breaks CR/LF translation goes away, was broken anyway. CRLF files can come from
anywhere, not just FAT filesystems.

We'll here's a thought: FAT doesn't work at all at the moment. So let Al fix
it without the CR/LF stuff, and those that desperately want it back can code
it themselves, hmm?
