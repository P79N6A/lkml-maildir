Yes, I misunderstood. Interesting that the running of an ordinary utility
depends on the kernel in this way.
I cry when I read the source.
    if ((size = read(l_fd,buff,sizeof(buff)+1)) < 0)
        die("read %s: %s",loader,strerror(errno));
    if (size > sizeof(buff))
        die("Chain loader %s is too big",loader);
Precisely what LILO does can be followed better by giving one or more -v
options.
The question remains: if you replace (in the kernel) the -ac2 msdos.c
by the vanilla msdos.c, does that improve things?
By the way, LILO has been a beautiful boot loader, but I think
it is slowly dying.
