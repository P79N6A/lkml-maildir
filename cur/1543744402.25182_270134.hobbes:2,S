It's all up to the rules you are using for udev.  If you have udev rules
that call out to scripts for every device (like I think the SuSE default
install does), udevstart can take a long time.
If you don't have any external dependancies, udevstart is fast.

Please post what version of udev you are using, and what your udev rules
file looks like.
