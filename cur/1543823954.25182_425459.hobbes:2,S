Yeah.  It was very strongly constrained to a power-of-two in the dim and
distant past, when buffer_heads were only ever used for true buffer-
cache data (the entire IO path had to be special-cased for IO that
wasn't from the buffer cache, such as swap IO.)  
But more recently it has been a lot more relaxed, and we've had patches
like Jens' "varyIO" patches on 2.4 which routinely generated odd-sized
b_size buffer_heads when doing raw/direct IO on unaligned disk offsets.
But in 2.6, I _think_ such paths should be going straight to bio, not
via submit_bh.  Direct IO certainly doesn't use bh's any more, and
pretty much any other normal disk IO paths are page-aligned.  I might be
missing something, though.
