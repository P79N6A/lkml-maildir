For example, some devices call pci_save_state before pci_disable_device
in
->suspend, but don't pci_enable_device in ->resume. This works before,
but 
is broken after the pci_save_state() change. We need to find those
drivers out
and change the individual drivers instead of this simple fix.
Martin, which sound driver do you use?
Thanks,
