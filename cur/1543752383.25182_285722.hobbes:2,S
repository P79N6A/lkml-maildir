I reported a similar thing with cdrecord, writing a first session 
successfully using the -multi flag, but not being able to append to it 
or read the size with the "-msinfo" flag. I was totally blown off and 
told I didn't have permissions on the device, even though I was able to 
write to it.
I believe the true answer is that the SCSI command filter is blocking a 
command needed to perform the operation, probably a command to lock the 
door of the drive. In my case I have permissions to write the CD, just 
not to read the info needed to write additional sessions.
