Yep, the VIA 4in1 drivers are purely for windows.
In linux, if the chipset-fixup code is being trigged on boot (and
appears in your dmesg?), then it looks like the problem maybe
elsewhere...
On the other hand, perhaps that fixup code isn't complete (or relies on
certain chipset features being on/off by default, vendor specific
defaults?)
