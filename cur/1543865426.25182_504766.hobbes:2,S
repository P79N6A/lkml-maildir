Hi all,
activity has been very calm for 2.4 since 2.4.34. Three minor fixes
were pending, and I finally decided to release 2.4.34.1 with them
instead of keeping them in the fridge. Upgrade is recommended for
users of smbfs with unix extension, since a security fix in 2.4.34
broke symlinks. Special thanks to Dann Frazier, Santiago Garcia
and Grant Coady who did the boring work of tracking and fixing the
problem.
The files are located at the usual places. Please give it some time
to sync between the servers, and preferably use ftp2.kernel.org.
Regards,
Willy
