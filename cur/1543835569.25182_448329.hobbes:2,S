- No endangering of customers' production machines without a compelling
  reason.
- No stepping back, as I don't know which BIOS version is on the
  board (DMI says "6.0", but Tyan has 1.0x on their website; the
  release date doesn't match either).
- I'd rather test a working workaround in the kernel before updating;
  if I have the problem, others have it too, and gettng Linux to boot in
  that situation isn't exactly trivial -- the fact that you need a
  clock= parameter when udevsend hangs is kindof non-obvious.
- ... and the not-quite-obvious reason: Tyan specifies that I *need* a
  Win95 or Win98 boot floppy to do that. While I don't really believe
  them, I still don't have one of those handy ... which brings me back
  to the first item in this list.
