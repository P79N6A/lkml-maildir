No. That is why we agree a general API that works for all platforms.

Drivers own their devices register sets.  Therefore if there are any
vendor unique actions that can be taken by the driver to recovery we
expect the driver to do so.  For example, if the drivers see "xyz" error
and there is a known errata and workaround that involves resetting some
registers on the card.  From our perspective we see drivers taking care
of their own cards but the AER driver and your platform code will take
care of the bus/link interfaces.

Our goal is to have the AER driver be part of the general code base
because it is based on a PCI SIG specification that can be implemented
across all architectures.

For a FATAL error the link is "unreliable".  This means MMIO operations
may or may not succeed.  That is why the reset is performed by the
upstream port driver.  The interface to that is reliable.  A reset of an
upstream port will propagate to all downstream links.  So we need an
interface to the bus/port driver to request a reset on its downstream
link.  We don't want the AER driver writing port bus driver bridge
control registers.  We are trying to keep the ownership of the devices
register read/write within the domain of the devices driver.  In our
case the port bus driver.
