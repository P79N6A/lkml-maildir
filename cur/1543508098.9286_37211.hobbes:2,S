I've ensured the USB serial controller isn't sharing any IRQs with anything
else.
I may have a dig around in the keyboard.c source to see if I can tweak it to
handle non-0 status packets.
Does a non-0 status unusual in a stream of packers (eg error)? What is the
best way to handle this? Just process the keyboard data as usual, then check
the error bit in the status word, and report errors?

I'll give it a go...but your patch still isn't in 2.3.16.

My mouse has magically started working again. Actually, I didn't include the
UHCI option in the kernel config(!). Heehe.
Thanks for the feedback,
