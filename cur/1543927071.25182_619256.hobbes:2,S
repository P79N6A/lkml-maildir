Hi!
I think that this worked before:
root@amd:/proc# find . -name "timer_info"
find: WARNING: Hard link count is wrong for ./net: this may be a bug
in your filesystem driver.  Automatically turning on find's -noleaf
option.  Earlier results may have failed to include directories that
should have been searched.
root@amd:/proc#
