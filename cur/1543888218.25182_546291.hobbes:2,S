Having redundant everything would be preferable.  But cables do
sometimes fail.  Not sure about the controllers, but if the controller
went you might loose the whole raid.

Well I guess the theory is that a gold plated connector won't corrode as
much so the connection is less likely to fail.  Not sure if there is any
proof to backup that theory.
