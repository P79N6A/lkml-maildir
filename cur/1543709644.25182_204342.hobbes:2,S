For something as significant as user<->kernel data transfers, it might
be worth eliminating the bouncing as well - by using per-CPU * per-mm
spinlocks.
User<->kernel data transfers would take the appropriate per-CPU lock
for the current mm, and not take page_table_lock.  Everything that
normally takes page_table_lock would, and also take all of the per-CPU locks.
That does require a set of per-CPU spinlocks to be allocated whenever
a new mm is allocated (although the sets could be cached so it needn't
be slow).
