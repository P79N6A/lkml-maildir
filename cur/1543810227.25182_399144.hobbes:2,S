There is 14000 lines of code that is very far away from being
mergeable into kernel. It is less work to reimplement it in userspace
than clean it up for kernel inclusion. 
And no, Nigel is *not* willing to help. He's willing to fix small
problems, but not big ones.

It is not done. It is too ugly, and it is not done in a way that could
be merged into kernel.

...and probably never seen suspend2 patch.
If you see suspend2 patch, and still feel some parts of it are good
and could be reused in userspace, feel free to help.
