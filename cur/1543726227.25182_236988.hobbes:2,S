I don't have such hardware, but I don't see any obvious problems
with the patch.
In my opinion Becker's complaints were invalid, or maybe I just
didn't understand what he was trying to say.  At any rate, lots of
other NICs have supported larger MTUs and VLANs w/out problem, so
it is unlikely that there is a fundamental flaw in accepting larger
frames.
There are patches for tulip floating around too.  I have been running
traffic on these patches for a while with no obvious problems
(on 2.4 kernel, however).  Jeff, if you want me to re-send this to you,
please let me know!
