It puts .text at 1MB. Your vdso file must be huge? 
It looks like it ignores the
-Wl,-z,max-page-size=4096 -Wl,-z,common-page-size=4096
options passed to it. The AMD64 ABI has a 1MB minimum page size, but
these options are supposed to disable it.
Not sure how to work around this, but having an 1+MB vdso would be incredibly
wasteful. What version is it? Perhaps we just drop support for this. I can't
think of a workaround currently.
