I'm hitting this all the time on 2.6 more so than on 2.4, especially for CPU 
bound procs.

Maybe, but on 2.6, echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space seems to 
improve the situation most of the time, although not always.

Specifically, 3/4/586 don't show this problem, whereas 686+ show the problem 
to varying degrees with slowdown upto 333% on P4.
Can you confirm this?
Thanks!
