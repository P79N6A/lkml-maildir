Rik, the things you and I both agreed should be added are worth adding, but they are not worth
delaying reiserfs integration for.  Delaying reiserfs integration will do nothing to speed them. 
The out of memory bug is not so different in kind from an out of memory bug linux used to have that
it lived with for years, and if I am not mistaken it is quite a bit harder to trigger.  Yura will
comment on this.  Millions of users (according to what SuSE tells me our level of usage is in
Europe) are not wandering around saying, damn, I keep making reiserfs freeze.  Do you use reiserfs? 
Does it freeze on you?  Still, we don't like having any bugs and we think the clean fix would be
better.  Mark us experimental when we are included if you really worry about this one.  We can write
the patch and send it to you in a week or so, I think we'll do so lest it become made into more than
it is.
Hans
