I think it may have worked for you on-and-off in the middle of those 
changes. It's been a nightmare trying to get both device types 
identified correctly.

Can you detail your changes? I'm not convinced by this, because I have 
been careful not to change any HP8200-specific code (except the 
detection), and also, I don't think it is possible for the device to 
appear as a disk if the HP8200 codepath is being followed.
There was one other report of this but my emails to that reporter were 
bouncing so I left this in my todo mailbox.
