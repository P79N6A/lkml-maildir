Subject: [PATCH 0/10] local_t : adding and standardising atomic primitives
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

These patches extend and standardise local_t operations on each architectures,
allowing a rich set of atomic operations to be done on per-cpu data with
minimal performance impact. On some architectures, there seems to be no
difference between the SMP and UP operation (same memory barriers, same
LOCking), local.h simply includes asm-generic/local.h, which removes duplicated
code.
These patches applies on 2.6.20-rc1-git7.
It depends on the patch "atomic.h : standardising atomic primitives"
