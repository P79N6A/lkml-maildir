On thing me (as a user) would like to see is more user limits.
In particular; a (small) per-user mlock limit would be nice so a normal user
can mlock some memory to avoid buffer underruns without needing to give suid
permissions to cdrecord (which is what people uses now and guarantees you'll
have to update your cdrecord copy some day due to unavoidable security issues).
I wonder if this is a good wishlist item or just a stupid idea...
