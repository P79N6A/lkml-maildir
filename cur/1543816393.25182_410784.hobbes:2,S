Thanks for the advice, I will dive into nesting. I could not find any 
in tree users who use nesting, so I have a few questions
nla_nest_start() accepts two parameters an skb and an attribute type.
Do I have to create a new attribute type like TASKSTATS_TYPE_AGGR to
contain the nested attributes 
TASKSTATS_TYPE_AGGR
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_PID/TGID
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_STATS
but this will lead to
TASKSTATS_TYPE_AGGR
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_PID
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_STATS
TASKSTATS_TYPE_AGGR
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_TGID
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_STATS
being returned from taskstats_exit_pid().
The other option is to nest
TASKSTATS_TYPE_PID/TGID
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_STATS
but the problem with this approach is, nla_len contains the length of
all attributes including the nested attribute. So it is hard to find
the offset of TASKSTATS_TYPE_STATS in the buffer.
Do I understand NLA nesting at all? May be I am missing something obvious.
Thanks,
Balbir
