This sounds very interesting, but the point is, that the problems went
away, as soon as I switched off UDMA in the BIOS. Linux still does use
UDMA(33), and I haven't seen any errors yet. And the drive seems to run
at full speed. So I consider this a bug in the BIOS.

Does this mean, it's normal for a WDC84AA to generate bad CRCs?
