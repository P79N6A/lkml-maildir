Normally, the underscore states that the macro does not do the proper locking itself (this is not our case). Therefore, I would suggest using a name that suggests against what the macro is protected.

I can see your point, to a degree. The difference here is that the
variants you mention are actually macros that do something, they
aren't stubs for code. IOW, you actually know what's happening
underneath a foo() vs. _foo() by its name only. Maybe this applies
the same to markers, I don't know. But maybe we want to make it
easy for those looking at markers that there's a master kill
switch somewhere that all markers go through and through which
they can all be disabled very simply (say by using a "#if 0").
While different names *may* be doing that, a same name *does* that.
But I don't feel too strongly either way, it's really up to those
who maintaining the code to say.
