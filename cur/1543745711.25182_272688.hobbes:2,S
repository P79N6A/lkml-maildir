I guess what I was having difficulty with was how to go from bus/devfn
to pci_dev in the bus macros (to access the saved_config_space) and do this
safely at interrupt level. The spinlock protecting the devices list on the
pci_bus struct is never acquired with irqsave and all the existing
functions to search for a given pci device are not callable from
interrupt context.
