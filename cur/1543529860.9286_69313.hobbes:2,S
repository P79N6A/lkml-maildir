   It looks to me like either linux is spilling form the L2 cache
   earlier that FreeBSD or that lack of page colouring (remember the
   PPro cores are only 4-way SA) could be the problem?
Page coloring could indeed be the cause.  I'll try to
write up a new version of my old page coloring "hack
patch" so you can experiment to see if it makes any
difference.
Later,
