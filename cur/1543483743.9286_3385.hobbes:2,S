I goofed and forgot to ask you SCSI or IDE.
This only begins the process of detection and if an ide-chipset is needed,
we move on from there.

I recall form "Thornton Prime <thornton@cnation.com>" showing me
the funkiest /proc/pci info I have ever seen to date.
This dual P2 reported complete two chipsets, Intel and Samurai.
cat /proc/pci (sent to me)

This looks like one wild ride to make this one go.
