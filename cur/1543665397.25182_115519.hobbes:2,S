I got an hang/oops with the tg3 driver aswell.
I just wanted to make sure that 1.4c+ fixes this bug too:

I've still got it in KDB if you want to find anything out from that
(tell me what to do) ...
Before this hang i had a e1000 card that also stopped working after a
while, so i switched to tg3, and ofcourse i got a hang there too :)
