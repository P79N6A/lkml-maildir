Hello,
	in man page 7 packet it is described as
                  unsigned short  sll_hatype;    /* Header type */
	However, it still does not tell me much. Looking over sources
	I can see it is being set to dev->type, and types it is set
	are defined in include/linux/if_arp.h 
	Thus would it be correct to tell is that it is just 
	device type, and the name 'hatype' is kind of 
	missleading?
