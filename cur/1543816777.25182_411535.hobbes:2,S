Just a data point...
My ARM GCCs are configured for the default arm-linux ABI,
not the EABI, and gcc-4.0.3 and gcc-4.1 both appear to be
solid for user-space code; they also bootstrap themselves
(on an ARM) just fine. I haven't used them for kernels however.
On the other hand, gcc-3.3.6 and gcc-3.4.6 both require several
add-on patches to fix incorrect code generation, and even then
there are a couple of known unfixed bugs (PR25133 and PR26463 in
particular; PR25133 can be worked around but PR26463 scares me).
