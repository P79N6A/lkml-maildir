Someone has to fix all the problems with the new probe model first. Like
the fact we don't have any meaningful address space locking or
sane refcounting for the scsi objects. Until that happens its not a relevant
discussion IMHO
When you can answer "what lock prevents my address space being reissued
before all memory/I/O has provably completely" and "at what point can I
free my scsi structures on a hot unplug safely for all situations" then
its worth discussion
