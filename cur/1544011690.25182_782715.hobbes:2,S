Xen only needs the callback in the case of traffic originating in 
another Xen domain.  If iscsi is involved, it will be running in the 
other domain, and so all its callbacks and so on will happen there.  
There's no conflict.

An external lookup would just need to change put_page -> net_put_page, I 
think.

I'm not very familiar with the network stack, but am I right in assuming 
that the shared_info destructor would be called when the network stack 
has finished with all the pages it refers to?  And those pages could be 
the combination of pages separately submitted in different skbs?
