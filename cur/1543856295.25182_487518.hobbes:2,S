Sorry about that.  Is it ok to send the patch as an attachment?  It
seems like gmail likes to linewrap plain text.  Also, when I resend
the patch after a little fixing should I send it as a reply.

It is in milliseconds.  I'll add that to the comment when I resend the patch.

This was taken from USB skeleton driver, and nothing more needs to be
added or changed for error handling, that I could think of now
anyways.

No this really isn't needed.  I'll take it out.

I didn't look at sysfs or usbfs.  I just needed a way to determine the
device from a device node in /dev from user space, and it seemed easy
to use ioctl.

The devices have a stream mode which can only be read from the second
bulk in endpoint.  All other communications are done from the first
bulk in and bulk out endpoints, and I needed some way to indicate that
the the next read should be from second bulk in endpoint keeping in
mind that first bulk in endpoint can still be used.  Is there a better
way to do this?
Thanks,
David
