Unconditionally adding up n fields in the runqueue versus 1 field?
It is inevitable that they will cross cacheline boundaries on some
CPU architectures and with some per-cpu implementations isn't it?

Of course they should be made consistent where it makes sense.

I don't think a departing runqueue should have any iowaiters on it, should it?

Maybe (they're also used in different ways, and with different races to
be careful of so in some respects that is inevitable). But that doesn't
mean we should introduce this new get_sched_stats thing.

Now common scheduler operations have to access the runqueue cacheilnes
and this disjoint "stats" structure cacheline, so basic operations will
get slower. Not to mention that all but one are protected by the runqueue
lock, so local_t isn't needed for the rest of them.

Sure, those consistency and efficiency changes should be made now, with
the current structure.
