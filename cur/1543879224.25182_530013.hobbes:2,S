Dear all,
I am using a customized PCI board of IXP2400 (Intel's network
processor) on host PC having xeon dual core processor with Redhat
2.6.9.
My PCI card is running RedBoot on it.
After booting I am not able to get BAR register on my IXP2400 card
assigned properly.
If I do lspci –vv on host following is the output I am getting for my card
 04:03.0 Co-processor: Intel Corp. IXP2400 Network Processor (rev 01)
(prog-if 01)
	Control: I/O- Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr+
Stepping- SERR+ FastB2B-
	Status: Cap- 66Mhz+ UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort-
<TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
	Latency: 64 (250ns min, 1000ns max), Cache Line Size 10
	Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 209
	Region 0: Memory at <ignored> (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
	Region 1: Memory at <ignored> (32-bit, prefetchable)
	Region 2: Memory at <ignored> (32-bit, prefetchable)
But if I reboot my host machine after this then next time I am getting
BAR register assignment properly
And my lspci –vv output is as
04:03.0 Co-processor: Intel Corp. IXP2400 Network Processor (rev 01)
(prog-if 01)
	Control: I/O- Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr+
Stepping- SERR+ FastB2B-
	Status: Cap- 66Mhz+ UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort-
<TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
	Latency: 64 (250ns min, 1000ns max), Cache Line Size 10
	Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 209
	Region 0: Memory at dee00000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1M]
	Region 1: Memory at ddf00000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=1M]
	Region 2: Memory at c0000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=256M]
I am not getting why this behavior happens, any guess?
Thanks
Rahul
