I have add /linuxrc, /init and /bin/init, all link to /sbin/init.
It just refuses to work ... :(

My harddisk works fine without initrd.

I have tried these kernel parameters:
	init=/bin/bash
	init=/linuxrc
	init=/init
	init=/sbin/init
None works.
Also, after some google, I found that the format of initrd has changed.
I also tried a new initrd with cpio format. The kernel recognized it:
	Boot Logs:
	1) checking if image is initramfs... it is
	   Freeing initrd memory: 17583k freed
	2) loading drivers
	3) Freeing unused kernel memory: 128k freed
After the kernel start, I add breakpoints at cpu_idle and do_schedule.
cpu_idle never reached, only do_schedule did. Is that strange?
