	Hi!
This command hangs my system. It works for a 100K file, but it hangs my
system, if the file is 470M. It does not matter, if the disk is SCSI or
ide.
linux 2.4.2
glibc-2.2.2
gcc-2.95.2.1
e2fs-1.19
With kernel 2.2.18, it works fine.
===============
I also have some problem, with ncpfs. I am not quite sure, because I had to
hack the source, to compile it, but the same hack works with 2.2.18.
If you have anything to tell, please mail me. I am not on the list.
