I was not asking if /you/ thought there was any interresting info in
dmesg, I asked for the dmesg outut so that everyone else on the list
reading your email would be able to get some details about your system
from the output.
The same goes for lsci, lsusb, /proc/cpuinfo, ver_linux output, the
kernel .config etc. We don't have your system nor a kernel build
exactely like yours, so we need those details to be able to help you
better, wether or not you think it is relevant to provide that info is
irrelevant, please just provide the info you are asked for if you want
people to try and help you.

If you suspect it at all, even slightly, then why not try and remove
it from the equation by simply taking the card out of the machine for
a while?
