ok without ati-drivers kernel module loaded the computer basicly just
hard locks when
some bug hits dunno if its the same item 
to repeat it tho one needs laptop-mode enabled have xmms playing music
(flac in my case)
which resides on nfs then just put the computer under some local load
for a little bit
till which im guessing it needs to clear some memory or somethin and
it hits this hard lock
or the errors i mailed previously when ati-drivers is loaded
