Yes. This has the advantage of being readable, and the "sense" of the test 
always being obvious.
We have a sense problem with the "trylock()" cases - some return "it was
locked" (semaphores), and some return "I succeeded" (spinlocks), so not
only is the sense not immediately obvious from the usage, it's actually
_different_ for semaphores and for spinlocks.
So I like "read_can_lock()", since it's also obvious what it returns.
(And yes, we should fix the semaphore trylock return code, dammit.)
