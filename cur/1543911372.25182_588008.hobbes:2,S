Grumble.
Ok.   This is a two sided bug.
The NET_IRDA define as not put in sysctl.h where it belongs so I
missed it, when making the list of all existing binary sysctls.
So really I need to put update the sysctl_check tables to have
the NET_IRDA numbers, because at least at first skim everything
looks ok on the binary side.
Patches to follow shortly.
Eric
