I suspect that the failure to enable this by default is a relic of the
pre-dmix era, when access to the sound device was exclusive, to prevent
another app from grabbing it in the interim.
Of course this behavior is completely unnecessary with ALSA 1.0.9 or
later, as the default PCM uses dmix so the above scenario would not
block the sound card.
Anyway, KDE does not need to release the sound device to prevent this.
Simply stopping the PCM should be enough.
