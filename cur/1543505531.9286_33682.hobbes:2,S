Yes, I think this flag should protect the information from being
disclosed. The user is still responsible for keeping a backup, though.

Yes, but this would prevent the key from being upgraded/changed. Basically
this rule is rather unneccessary, but won't hurt.

This does not prevent root from reading it while the securelevel is 2. But
this is a definite must.

Not for currently open exclusive handles. This is required for
transferring the key from one file to another securely without a race
condition.

No problem with that, but the write handle I have must stay open.

Yes, but they contain the key. If I were to upgrade the crypto routines, I
need to create a new file, write out the routines, write out the key and
close the file with whatever structures are needed. And while the key is
written, all read access must already be forbidden, or we have a race
condition here.
