No - not 'rm -fr'.
'rmdir'
Remove the cpuset directory, not start bottom up
trying to remove the files first.
The poor 'rm -fr' command doesn't understand the
rather odd nature of cpuset file systems, which
have all files coming and going automagically in
the middle of the night, and only allow mkdir and
rmdir operations, not creat or unlink.
