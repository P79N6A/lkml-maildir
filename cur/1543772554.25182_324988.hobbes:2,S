Absolutely but it relies on the other stack being correctly implemented.
The attack would work perfectly fine if there wasn't the rule that a RST
must not be sent in response to another RST. The attack has been
successful and still is because some firewalls are configured to send
RSTs without respecting this rule.
I like your patch and the idea behind it, it can successfully defeat the
most simple method of preventing connections being established.
