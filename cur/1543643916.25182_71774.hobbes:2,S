Thanks to Con and everyone for making this necessary.
The contest (
http://contest.kolivas.net
) has been added to 
the OSDL Scalable Test Platform. (
http://www.osdl.org/stp
) 
Sample results for a 2- cpu system with 2.4.20-pre5-ac1
Test 		Time(sec)	CPU %	Ratio 
noload		61.95		195%	baseline 
process_load	69.45		170%	1.12l 
io_halfmem	67.86		179%	1.10l 
io_fullmem	100.57		121%	1.62l 
mem_load	96.06		129%	1.55l
Results for a single-CPU system ( 2.4.20-pre5-ac1 )
noload		104.65		99%	baseline 
process_load	116.80		88%	1.12l 
io_halfmem	117.81		89%	1.13l 
io_fullmem	128.72		82%	1.23l 
mem_load	143.17		77%	1.37l
Full report:

 ( 2-cpu)
http://khack.osdl.org/stp/5234/
		     ( 1-cpu)
Would very much appreciate your comments. One note: 
The '-j' value is adjusted = number of cpu's * 4 
However, the background load is the same regardless of system size.
Should the load be scaled with the system? 
( say, one copy of each load program per cpu? ) 
Also, our friendly PLM now automagically inhales the -ac series
(i think...i see 2.4.20-pre5-ac[1-6] plus a few more )
