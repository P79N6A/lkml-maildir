ext2_fs.h has been there for much longer, and unlike ext3_fs.h it
actually is useable by userpsace.  Of course everyone should be using
the headers from e2fsprogs by now, but I'm not sure if that's really the
case.
In past cases like that Olaf did greps over the whole OpenSuSE tree,
so maybe he could do it for this aswell?
