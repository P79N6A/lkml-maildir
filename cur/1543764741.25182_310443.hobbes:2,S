GCC 4 isn't very happy.  Mostly sign changes, but also something
that looks like a real error:
gcc -g -O3 -Wall   -c -o fsck-cache.o fsck-cache.c
fsck-cache.c: In function 'main':
fsck-cache.c:59: warning: control may reach end of non-void function 'fsck_tree' being inlined
fsck-cache.c:62: warning: control may reach end of non-void function 'fsck_commit' being inlined
I assume that fsck_tree and fsck_commit should complain loudly
if they ever get to that point - but since I'm not quite sure
there's no patch, sorry.
