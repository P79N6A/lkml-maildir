O_NONE might be a good thing to do with that, but I think the "careful" 
semantics should be a separate flag (we shouldn't have different side 
effects depending on the individual mode.)
O_NONE would be a useful complement to O_CAREFUL though; for some 
devices O_CAREFUL with anything *other than* O_NONE might be an invalid 
operation.
The semantics would obviously be device dependent, but the basic idea 
should be that opening with O_CAREFUL should not disturb the global 
state of the device; it should only create a handle.
