I have 2 24" screens running at 1920x1200 with X forced to 75dpi and use
a 8pt Monospace font. (Yes, I can read that from more than 3ft away)
Using a fullscreen gvim (without the icons, but with the menu) with 3
vertical splits gives me 4 columns of 113 rows and 95 chars.
So, yes, I have the screen estate for very long lines, but I find that
long lines require more effort to read (that very much includes leading
whitespace). Also, since long lines are rare (and they should be, if you
nest too deep you have other issues) accommodating them would waste a
lot of screen estate otherwise useful for another column of text.
Even with e-mail, I can easily show over 200 characters wide with a
large font (say 11pt) but find it harder to read emails that don't
nicely wrap at 78. So much so that I often find myself not reading the
mail, or restyling it if I find it important enough to read anyway.
Please, lets keep the 80 as a guideline, and not trip over the
occasional lines that exceed it in good style (read: wrapping them would
indeed give uglier code)
