  I've been trying to run my NFS server on 2.6 kernels for a while now.
My desktop and my Firewall are both 2.6 already and happy.  My
fileserver though is giving me an ulcer.
  I have nfs server compiled into the kernel and the client as a module.
I've tried both with and without NFSv4 (with NFSv3 definitely).  No
matter what I try though my client machines keep getting stale
filehandles.  I can cd ~ and do an "ls -la", if I get much more complex
and try something such as 
cd ~/.spamassasin 
ls -la
ls -la
  I get the stale handles.  Reverting back to 2.4 and all is well on the
same export and mount configs.
Thoughts?
:wq!
