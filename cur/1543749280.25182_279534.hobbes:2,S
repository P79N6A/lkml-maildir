I haven't tried on my box yet, but another guy did it and he could 
reproduce this, and also fix it: It seems to be nforce2 specific issue. 
In bios you have the option ext-p2p. though bios states that 30us will 
prevent data corruption on si3112, it is not true. It seems that is must 
be set to 1ms.
Is it possible to do this in linux kernel just for safety? I think this 
is rather crucial...
