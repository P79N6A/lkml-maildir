The "different symptoms" above are indeed unrelated and solved by reverting
	"commit 559bbe6cbd0d8c68d40076a5f7dc98e3bf5864b2
    	 power_state: get rid of write-only variable in SATA"
The cpu_hotplug code used by suspend together with hr_timer and nohz looks
suspicious:
	$ echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
	$ echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
	(repeat until dmesg|tail shows WARNs; here it took 2 iterations)
causes symptoms like in 1st message of this thread again.
Thanks,
