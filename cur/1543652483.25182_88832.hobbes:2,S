Sorry, I still don't get it.  If the flush_cache_page is doing something
necessary, then won't a user access in between it and invalidating pte
undo what was necessary?  And if it's not necessary, why do we do it?
(For better performance would be a very good reason.)
But don't worry about me: I may well have some fundamental misconception
which emailing back and forth will fail to resolve, would just waste your
time and expose my ignorance.  (I think Andrew has sometimes protested
that "flush" can mean too many different things.)  So I'm trying to
understand it better from over here - but glad to see Rik seems
to understand my concern.
