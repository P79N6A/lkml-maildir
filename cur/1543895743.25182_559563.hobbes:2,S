Yes, I would expect simple hard links to be a better solution for this,
but the feature request is not that out of line.  I actually had plans
on implementing auto duplicate block reuse earlier in btrfs.
Snapshots already share duplicate blocks between files, and so all of
the reference counting needed to implement this already exists.
Snapshots are writable, and data mods are copy on write, and in general
things work.
But, to help fsck, the extent allocation tree has a back pointer to the
inode that owns an extent.  If you're doing snapshots, all of the owners
of the extent have the same inode number.   If you're sharing duplicate
blocks, the owners can have any inode number, and fsck becomes much more
complex.
In general, when I have to decide between fsck and a feature, I'm going
to pick fsck.  The features are much more fun, but fsck is one of the
main motivations for doing this work.
Thanks for the input,
Chris
