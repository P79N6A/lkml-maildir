   If the ioctl translation layer can't handle duplicates it has bigger
   problems than that
How else can the current scheme translate arguments correctly
if the ioctl values are identical?
Let's say that the video info struct is two ints, right?
That would make the two ioctl values in question be identical.
I agree whole-heartedly that the current scheme is flawed, what
really should happen is that the translations occur in the ioctl
handlers themselves, not in some funny sparc port sources.
That is something I will be doing in 2.5.x, for sure.
