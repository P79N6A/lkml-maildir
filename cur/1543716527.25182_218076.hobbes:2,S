Andrew,
Could you please clarify how this things become to be dependent on
read-ahead at all.
At my understanding read-ahead it to catch sequential (or other) access
pattern and do some advance reading, so instead of 16K request we do
128K request, or something similar.
But how could read-ahead disabled end up in 16K request converted to
several sequential synchronous 4K requests ? 
It all looks pretty strange.
