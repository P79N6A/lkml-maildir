Subject: [patch 54/67] PKT_SCHED: cls_basic: Use unsigned int when generating handle
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: David Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
gcc-4.1 and later take advantage of the fact that in the
C language certain types of overflow/underflow are undefined,
and this is completely legitimate.
Prevents filters from being added if the first generated
handle already exists.
