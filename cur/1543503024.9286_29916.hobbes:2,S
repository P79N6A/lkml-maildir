All,
At hj's suggestion, I reverted back from 2.2.10-ac10 stepwise in an
attempt at isolating the lockd oops reported yesterday.  I've narrowed it
down to an apparent conflict between Trond's client patches and hj's
locking patches.  Here's the breakdown:
Kernel 2.2.10 w/
--------------------------------------
ac10 & nfsd-2.2.7-2.lockd.patch: broken
ac10:  broken
linux-2.2.10-nfsv3-0.9.11.3.dif &
 nfsd-2.2.7-2.lockd.patch &
 linux-2.2.7-sunrpc.patch &
 nfsd-2.2.7-3.patch &
 nfsd-2.2.7-nfsfh.patch : broken
nfsd-2.2.7-2.lockd.patch &
 linux-2.2.7-sunrpc.patch &
 nfsd-2.2.7-3.patch &
 nfsd-2.2.7-nfsfh.patch : OK!
--------------------------------------
I notice that Trond's patches affect many files in the rpc/auth*
subsystem.  Since the oopses are occurring in that section, one would
conclude that something is conflicting.  
I know I've made this appeal before, but here it goes again:
Proper NFS function (i.e. client, server, locking subsystem, etc) is quite
important to many of us.  Would it be possible to work towards a bit more
intercommunication and coordination between those chasing each other about
the same sections of code?  The situation is confusing the heck out of me
(with many years of hacking background) - I can only begin to imagine what
newbies and harried sysadmins are going through.
I know that many others share this sentiment.  I _do_ appreciate the hard
work, and am not trying to negate the considerable efforts you've all
made.  I'd just like to see some movement towards consolidation of
patches.
Thanks for listening!
Steve
p.s. - I posted the decoded oopsen and test program yesterday, but please
       drop me a note if you would like a copy.
