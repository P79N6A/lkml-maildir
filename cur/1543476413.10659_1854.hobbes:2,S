	Is tunlx: OSPFable ? , I think it may be .  Haven't tried lately
	any of the more esoteric functionalities of linux .
	But I think I will be soon .;-)

	I can understand this thought .  And what is needed is a method 
	to 'aggregate' /32's used into a /xx exportable single route
	statement . Ie: several 255.255.255.255's aggregated into a single
	255.255.255.0 or some such . I know it's a gated.conf problem .

	OK, Boss guy where did you hide information of 'Explicit aliases' 
	not to be found in Documentation dir ? At least by that naming .
	I Know use the source 'P^HLuke', But haven't seen good notes
	in most area's of source & little 'Luke Source Walker' gets
	lost really easy without notes on the way thru the Sources .

	Also got this. But does it requires whacking the kernel ?
	Another one of very little documentation .  Where may I
	find copious docs on 'ip' tool you have made ?  What little
	I have played with it , it is a nice tool ;-)
	Was going to ask if newest release of 'ip' tool had any
	docs , So I went and got it .  No docs , Yet .  When can
	someone possibly see docs for these nice tools,  They are
	close to being self documenting but aren't really there
	yet .

	If an aliased interface existed in the kernel then gated 
	(normally) would see & use it as a valid interface .
	just grab 3.5.9 & make an eth0:0 and 'gdc interface' then do
	a 'gdc dump' and look .  It will be there .

	do a 'gdc dump' and look at the 'Router ID:' in it ??? 
	it will be pointing to the aliased interfaces ip .
	This will present the 192.168.0.1 as the router broadcasting
	rip/ospf/... to the other routers its routes .  Which will
	be recorded as an 'bad route' .  gated will still use the 
	proper interface thus the routes will still be properly
	advertised .
	Also with your latest patches I have noticed a contious stream
	in the gated.dmp/messages files the response below every
	rip update.
	Now mind you this is in both gated.dmp & /var/log/messages .:-}
