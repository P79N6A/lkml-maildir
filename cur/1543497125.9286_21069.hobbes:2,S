You can design I/O Buses on which the CPU uses the same bus protocol as
normal I/O devices and that allows any device to access the whole memory
and memory mapped IO space. PCI is obviously a good example of that. (Note
that it seems that, when only CPU-to-brain-wired-O/S-guys are involved in
the design of an interface with a PCI sub-system, they used to allow the
CPU some features regarding BUS accesses that normal I/O devices haven't.
This is an hack too, in my opinion).
It is possible by design on those Buses for any device acting as a master
to directly talk to another device acting as a target and it is this way
I/Os involving the CPU are _actually_ working. In order for direct I/O to
I/O not looking like a hack, we probably need to have sophisticated I/O
controllers that can host some logic that is currently part of the O/S. 
This let me think that it is possible, at least on paper, to implement
such a system that is absolutely not a hack.
