hm.  I'm not a huge fan of debugfs (for other reasons, nicely explained
by Matt Mackall a while back).
But I don't think we actually *gain* anything by putting softirq stats
into debugfs, whereas it makes sense that it lives in /proc?
otoh, the internal implementation might be nicer if it uses debugfs
helper infrastructure.  But the existing code is pretty
straightforward.
