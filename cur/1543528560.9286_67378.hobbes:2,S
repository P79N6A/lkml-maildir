I tried virtually all kernel-combinations (not limited to sound/msp3400). 
The MSP3400 does depend on sound, at least for some combinations (like the
one above). 
What would be a greater pain: People who buy OSS-commercial have to change
their conf.modules to use OSS-commercial, or people without OSS-commercial
have a working kernel without all kinds of explicit rules and hidden
dependencies.
