Not too hard for me :-(
Definitely a race, and it appears to be somewhere in the fork/exec/wait
complex at the very least. insmod is not built into nash, so is getting
run as a seperate process. Since module loading itself is synchronous,
the error would seem most likely to be happening in sys_wait4.
It could be the compiler doing a bad optimization, it could be
some other optimization code triggered by the Pentium 4 config
option, or, as you say, it could be a race which is being
opened up by the changed build flags.
