If your device is 8250/16550/etc compatible, you should
be able to use the existing 8250.c serial driver.  If
your device is attached via PCI, look at 8250_pci.c for
examples of how to claim it.  I think if your device
claims to be PCI_CLASS_COMMUNICATION_SERIAL, 8250_pci.c
will claim it automatically with no code changes at all.
