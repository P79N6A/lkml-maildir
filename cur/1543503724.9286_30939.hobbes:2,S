Not entirely helpful, Alan. 
I spent at least two weeks ringing all the IBM numbers I had once,
looking for just this document and no-one I spoke to even knew what a
protocol was, let alone offer me how to purchase said item. 
A OS Manual on networking, yes but that is not quite the same thing is
it?
I gave up in the end, and the need for information faded into obscurity.
