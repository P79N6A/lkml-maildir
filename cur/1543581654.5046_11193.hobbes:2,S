Excellent plan: data centre sysadmins the world over will worship your
name if it works...
What exactly do you have in mind: a bidirectional connection you could
use to control everything from LILO/Grub onwards? Should be feasible,
anyway.
I'd go with UDP for this, rather than raw Ethernet. Use DHCP to get the IP
address(es) to connect to as console hosts? (That or a command line
option...)
The first thing is the kernel: just wrap around printk so as soon as eth0
is up, you set up a session and start sending packets.
I'll do a server to receive these sessions - simple text (no vt100 etc),
one window per session - and work on the protocol spec. Anyone willing
to do the client end of things - lilo, grub, kernel, etc??
James.
