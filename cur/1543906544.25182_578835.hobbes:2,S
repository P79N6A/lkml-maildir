Hi,
I can't guarantee this is all needed to fix this bug, but I think
this patch is necessary here.
Regards,

Subject: genirq: fix simple and fasteoi irq handlers
After the "genirq: do not mask interrupts by default" patch interrupts
should be disabled not immediately upon request, but after they happen.
But, handle_simple_irq() and handle_fasteoi_irq() can skip this once or
more if an irq is just serviced (IRQ_INPROGRESS), possibly disrupting a
driver's work.
The main reason of problems here, pointing the broken patch and making
the first patch which can fix this was done by Marcin Slusarz.
Additional test patches of Thomas Gleixner and Ingo Molnar tested by
Marcin Slusarz helped to narrow possible reasons even more. Thanks.
PS: this patch fixes only one evident error here, but there could be
more places affected by above-mentioned change in irq handling.
