ok, makes perfect sense. My suggestion for the next step would be to try
nice() or setpriority() to do priority isolation.
If that experiment works out fine (i.e. the xrun count is comparable to
the SCHED_FIFO case) then it would also be nice to do a nice --19 run
(under the hacked kernel), which is a priority level that doesnt have
starvation turned off in the patched kernel but is otherwise very close
in behavior to nice --20.
i.e. as an end result we'd have the following 3 priority setups
compared: SCHED_FIFO:RT-prio-1, SCHED_NORMAL:nice--20,
SCHED_NORMAL:nice--19. The (ideal) goal would be for them to have
near-identical audio-latency performance.
