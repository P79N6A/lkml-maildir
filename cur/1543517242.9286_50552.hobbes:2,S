Thanks!  I've tested.  Yes, it works well with SuperH.
BTW, I've found a bug in free_initrd_mem of x86 implementation.  It
always print "0k freed" as the variable `start' changes in the loop.
The printk should be before the loop, or we should hold the value of
`start'.
Anyway, thanks again for your responce and good work.
Happy Hacking,
