Yes, but that doesn't (necessarily) apply to the controller that is
likely to be the primary controller in a modern system.
The whole point is that what the BIOS considers primary isn't
necessarily tied to the standard ATA addresses anymore, with SATA
controllers being primary.
The question I'm asking is: do you think it's better to remove this from
hd.c, or do you think it's better to add it back boot code BIOS
detection (and take the risk of poking an ST-506 disk with legacy data
with parameters which may belong to another disk -- keep in mind this
can permanently damage an ST-506 disk)?

I've been trying to remove features that are obsolete and/or broken.  I
don't have access to this particular ancient hardware, nor any system
that can even host them.   It's very easy to add the stuff back in the
boot code; it's a much more tricky/annoying question if one *should* do
so.  That's part of a rewrite/cleanup.
