Thanks for the patch! I can't wait to go home and try it. AFAIK it affects
other boards aside of the ASUS A8V using the same chipset. Once I contacted
the ASUS support and they told me due to the chipset's design it is not
possible to enable the onboard sound when a PCI card is installed. It is
amazing that you could do it. :-)
