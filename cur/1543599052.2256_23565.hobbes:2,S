Although this won't help the basic problem, there could me as much as 100K
cached in those page tables.  I wonder if we could hook the pgt cache into
the VM cache shrinking, so we can free most, if not all of this cache
(rather than it being in the idle loop only).
I'll look into it, produce a patch, but I'm not a VM hacker.
