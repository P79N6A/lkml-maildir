Few tips:
If you want to trick swsusp/S3 into working, you might want to try:
* go with minimal config, turn off drivers like USB you don't really
need
* use ext2. At least it has working fsck. [If something seemes to go
  wrong, force fsck when you have a chance]
* turn off modules
* use vga text console, shut down X
* try running as few processes as possible, preferably go from single
use mode
When you make it work, try to find out what exactly was it that broke
suspend, and preferably fix that.
