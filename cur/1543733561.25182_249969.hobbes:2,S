Let me sort this out: If it can't be done POSIXly to a directory, it can't
be done in Reiser4 to a file (which really is a directory too). So there
can be exactly _one_ hard link to a file. Way borken.

Good luck with that one. I'd suspect if it can be made to work, it will
have _huge_ overhead, so much that it is useless. I'd love to be proven
