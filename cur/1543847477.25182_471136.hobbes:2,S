True. So wrap around what is there but do not add gazillion of definitions 
to all arches.

So this is a case for a wrapper.

Ok these are boundary checks that are easily coded around. Some 
variations on fls even exist that also do various flavors of end case 
handling.

Good stuff. I have always wanted that. The wrapper could check for a 
constant.

Well that is the same issue as (4).
