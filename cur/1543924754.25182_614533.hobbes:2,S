Actually, you don't need to.  You tell them it expects UTF-8 encoded  
strings and be done with it.  All US-ASCII characters from 0 through  
127 (IE: high bit clear) are exactly the same in UTF-8, and UTF-8  
special characters have the high bit set in all bytes.  Therefore you  
just assume that anything with the high bit set is part of a word and  
you can handle basic UTF-8.  (It doesn't work on special UTF-8 space  
characters like nonbreaking space and similar, but handling those is  
significantly more complicated).
