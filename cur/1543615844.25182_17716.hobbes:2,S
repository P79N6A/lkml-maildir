Simply try to disable swap (swapoff -a or comment out swap partitions in 
/etc/fstab and reboot).
I did this on a 384 MiB SMP box as I had bad interactive performance 
with some desktop apps and heavy background disk I/O (video grabing) 
around 2.4.10-2.4.13 (I did not reactivate swap since) and it solved my 
interactive perf woes.
