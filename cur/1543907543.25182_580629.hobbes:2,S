Could you elaborate?  From the point of view of the compiler, it "knows" 
that the variable doesn't change inside the loop.
In the "volatile considered evil" discussion in May of this year, Alan 
Cox explicitly mentioned the implementation of atomic primitives as a 
case where "volatile" might be required.

In the example I gave, as far as the compiler can detect there are no 
dependencies.  The code that changes the value is in a different 
compilation unit.

I certainly agree with this statement.
This leads logically to the question of whether there are cases where 
the compiler cannot detect that serialization is needed when 
implementing atomic_t accessor functions.  Previously in this thread 
you've said that there are not, while I've attempted to show that it is 
possible.
