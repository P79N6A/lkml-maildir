As German understading people can read above, Mr. Andreas de Pretis, sent me
this patch to forward it to the lkml. The problem seems to be, that he was not
able to do a 'make htmldocs', because of some (wrong) SGML tags in
journal-api.tmpl.
Please have a look at it, patch is attached (simple, but working. :-) ).
Best regards,
 Oliver
