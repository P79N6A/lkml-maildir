Not true, Donald's drivers do -not- work with development kernels
(except for early ones).
You are most likely not downloading all the modules required,
pci-scan.*, kern_compat.h, etc.  In general if I have problems with a
2.2.x bundled kernel driver, I'll download one from Donald's site and
try it.
