No, you have to understand that I don't want to call software_suspend() at 
all. You've made the choice not to accept the swsusp changes, so we're 
forking the code. We will have competing implementations of 
suspend-to-disk in the kernel. 
You may keep the interfaces that you had to reach software_suspend(), but
you may not modify the semantics of my code to call it. At some point, you 
may choose to add hooks to swsusp that abide by the calling semantics of 
the PM core, so that you may use the same infrastructure.
Please send a patch that only removes the calls to swsusp_* from 
pm_{suspend,resume}. That would be a minimal patch. 
Thanks,
	Pat
