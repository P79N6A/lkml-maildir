The books (ahem) acknowledge that the only authoritative document is the
code itself.

Gratuitous changes occassionally occur, but usually things are changed for
the better. That debate is orthogonal to documentation. 
But if you're going to go to the trouble of documenting all the internals
used by modules, you might as well call them externals. And prepare to
live with them for the next 20 years.

If Linus doesn't require someone to document their changes, how is that
different from today? People are certainly welcome to contribute docs.
Saying that we _should_ have documentation implies that developers
_should_ do it themselves.

It's implicit. Developer resources (either time or motivation) are finite.
Documentation effort therefore must take away from code effort. Code that
benefits from documentation is code that is unreadable. From
Documentation/CodingStyle:
                Chapter 5: Commenting
 Comments are good, but there is also a danger of over-commenting.  NEVER
 try to explain HOW your code works in a comment: it's much better to
 write the code so that the _working_ is obvious, and it's a waste of
 time to explain badly written code. 
Most of the stuff in Documentation are for users rather than developers,
which is as it should be. The internal documentation for developers that
does exist contains the broad outlines only, which is as it should be.
