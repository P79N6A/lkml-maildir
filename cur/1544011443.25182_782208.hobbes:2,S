Indeed, this function can be probably removed altogether later...
OTOH the current patch is safe even for 2.6.28 (based on years of experience
with the check that we had in IDE subsystem) and will fix some libata drivers
(pata_legacy, pata_qdi and pata_winbond) to use dword IO on >= ATA-2 devices.
[ In reality this a regression fix for IDE -> libata conversion as it is a
  huge performance improvement for the above mentioned DMA-less drivers. ]
Jeff, I would like to merge it through IDE tree since the other patch depends
on it but if you want to go ahead and push it to Linus earlier feel free to
do it (or I can include it into the next IDE fixes pull request if you like).
Thanks,
Bart
