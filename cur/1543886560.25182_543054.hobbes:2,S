I'd like to make a suggestion to make the wording of the warning
clearer:
WARNING: init/built-in.o(.text+0x4c): section mismatch: reference to
 .init.text:blah (between 'rest_init' and 'run_init_process')
I think this would remove the confusion - the primary information
relating to where the reference is located is contained together
("init/built-in.o(.text+0x4c)") and the confusing "between" clause
which seems to only be a hint becomes entirely secondary.
Moreover, it's similar to binutils warnings - which are of the form:
file:(section+offset): message
so is of a form that we're used to reading.
Patch below.  Also fixes the obviously wrong ordering of arguments
in the final case in the string of ifs.
Change modpost section mismatch warnings to be less confusing;
model them on the binutils linker warnings which we all know how
to interpret.
Also, fix the wrong ordering of arguments for the final case -
fromsec and refsymname were reversed.
