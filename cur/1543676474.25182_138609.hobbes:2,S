i forgot to mention that this is difficult with the way most of the
atm drivers are written.  in smp kernels, you cant disable interrupts
across all processors to keep the drivers bottom halves from running.
(ok, you could but it would be very naughty).  if the bottom halves were
tasklets this would be easy, but most drivers would need converted.
