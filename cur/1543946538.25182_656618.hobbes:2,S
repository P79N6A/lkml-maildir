This paragraph can be dropped, as the reasons that SELinux denial messages
are tagged with 'avc' are mostly historical.   If you want to expand on anything
in here, explain that 'AVC' messages are interesting because they indicate
some sort of security rule denial.  So - if you don't enable auditing,
your security messages end up in the kernel syslog.  If you enable auditing,
they end up in the audit logs.  Explaining *that* clearly would be a lot
more useful than explaining what avc originally stood for.. ;)
