the other oddities(?) i noticed were (some admittedly trivial):
1) Under General setup, turning off Power Management support
   deactivated all of ACPI support, but had a weird effect on
   its sibling, Advanced Power Management BIOS support.
   not sure if this is supposed to happen, it just looks
   weird.
2) under Input core support, if you deselect Joystick support,
   there are still a number of selectable joystick-related
   features available under Character devices -> Joysticks
   (although these appear to be more than just basic joystick
   options -- is that the reason?)
3) Radio adapters is currently subsumed under Video for Linux,
   under Multimedia devices, which seems inappropiate.
i'm sure there were a couple of other oddities i noticed, if anyone
was interested.
