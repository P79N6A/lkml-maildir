Scott Schwartz, Paul Haahr and Byron Rakitzis have a nice *printf replacement
library called libprint that comes in at about 6k on x86.  It isn't suitable
as a drop-in replacement (doesn't natively handle floating point formats, its
fprint takes an fd argument instead of a FILE *, and in its format language,
'u', 'h', 'l' and 'q' are modifiers rather than verbs), but besides its size
it also offers user-definable conversions, snprint and an sprint variation
that allocates enough memory by itself.
My notes are that it was posted to comp.sources.unix as part of volume 28.
