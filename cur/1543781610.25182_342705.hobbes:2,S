Except nothing in the network stack is using fp - the use of FP inside the
MIPS kernel is not supported in any way.  What happend is probably the
fetching of the opcode of the instruction in the branch delay slot of
the unaligned instruction emulator blew up because it uses a get_user which
again calls might_sleep and that won't exactly work if not called from
process context.
