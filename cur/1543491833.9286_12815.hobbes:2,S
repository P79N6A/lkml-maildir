I checked the linux-kernel FAQ, and didn't find an address for SPAM
reporting. (maybe the vger postmaster?) We have a problem here:
* repeated spam that _always_ starts flame wars
* no shame even -- he thinks it is OK
* no useful contribution (every single post is totally off-topic)
Yep, he is famous. Fame shouldn't be a license to spam.

A number of people have asked me to stop posting "off-topic" messages
about the name of the operating system.
I regret the annoyance of, and the need for, this thread.  But with
all respect, I believe I should and must respond to the messages that
others are posting (which is all I have done in this thread).  If I
don't challenge such claims, they will be believed by default.  (I
have avoided responding in cases where I see others have done the
job.)
If this thread is annoying, please imagine what it is like to see an
idealistic project stymied and made ineffective, because people don't
usually give it the credit for what it has done.  If you're an
idealist like me, that can ruin your whole decade.
