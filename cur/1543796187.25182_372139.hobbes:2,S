1) This mail is the only documentation on how to operate your patch.
   How do you suppose your users to find out how to operate the switch?
   (I asume it's really a switch, a toggle would be insane.)
   Since it's very short and only for special purpose, documenting it
   in Kconfig mignt be enough.
2) You're seperating your patches by file, not by function. ungood.
3) Your patches introduce a lot of whitespace.
