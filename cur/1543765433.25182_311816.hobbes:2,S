The user may not have any right to that memory, that means he
has no right to ask the kernel to mess with it either, even if the
kernel is authorized to do so.
Just as you can't ask a cop to jail someone.  Sure, the cop has the power
to arrest, but he will check that there is reason to do so and not
automatically assume that you are right.
