Could you elaborate why it is next to useless? I think 95% of Linux
web camera drivers don't support all features of a camera, like 
compression. Reverse engineering USB traffic is easy, reverse engineering
compressed formats is _hard_.

I understood that Nemosoft has already asked Philips a permission and 
denied for that. It hardly helps asking again and again and again... he has 
to maintain the driver, too.

Why do you think that *most* of the pwc driver is already GPL'ed then, and 
even (was) in the kernel?

Then you should remove most of the other drivers in the kernel too.
Besides, format conversions _are not allowed_ in the kernel. They belong 
into userspace.
Nemosoft: you should not have the power to demand removing the GPL'd code
from the kernel (I don't know about the law, but whatever it says, GPL'd 
license should not be revocable). You can ask, of course, but wouldn't it 
be simpler to just stop maintaining the in-kernel driver, if it already 
works?

Too bad seeing this. Nemosoft, I hope you will continue maintaining
the driver which looks very nice (though I haven't been able to test it),
at least as an external module. That allows you free hands to add any nice
features that would never been accepted into kernel, anyway.
