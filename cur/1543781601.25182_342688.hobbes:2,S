this is a recent change: i've started flagging "naked" use of 
local_irq_disable(), because it's a problem on PREEMPT_RT and it's a 
potential SMP bug on upstream kernels. A local_irq_disable() is 
converted either to raw_local_irq_disable() when justified (it's mostly 
only justified for lowlevel arch code), or is eliminated totally.  
(either by merging it into a nearby spin_lock API call, or by removing 
it altogether, making sure that code doesnt break).
Right now we print a warning on the first such API use, and then shut up 
about it. All local_irq_() APIs map to NOPs. (we keep the PF_IRQSOFF 
flag for compatibility, but only to get irqs_off() right which in turn 
shuts off a number of BUG_ON(!irqs_disabled()) warnings, and it doesnt 
have any other functional purpose.)
the desired end-result would be the total elimination of local_irq_*() 
API calls.

hm, it seems nfsd forgets to do an unlock_kernel() in some exit path it 
seems? We are enforcing strict balanced lock use in PREEMPT_RT - the 
upstream kernel is more relaxed about it.

this is a 'must not happen'. Somehow lock->held list got non-empty.  
Maybe some use-after-free thing? Havent seen it myself.
