Yeah, I figure there would not be any. Still I have a nagging suspicion
that the mux gets confused and I would like to see the full dmesg with
this patch applied and DEBUG enabled. Is there any change of getting it?
Actually, if you could change the patch so it would print not only data
but also str, like this:
printk(KERN_INFO "i8042.c: MUX reports error condition %02x (%02x)\n",
       data, str);
it would be even better.
Thanks!
