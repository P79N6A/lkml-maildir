My guess is that your writer is bad, or at minimum needs a firmware 
upgrade. However, is this the real cdwrite program from Joerg Schilling, 
or is it one of the hacked versions which come with some distributions 
with mods to burn DVDs?
I would also specify the real device name, like dev=/dev/hdX, and drop 
the speed= option and let it choose one it likes. You may also want to 
use the -atip option to see what cdrecord thinks about your drive.
