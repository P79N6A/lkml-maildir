Cool.  That's EXACTLY what I was looking for.  Thanks.
Thanks also to the people who pointed out pppd's "pty"
option (yes I read the docs on that, but they're a bit
cryptic).  And yes, my pseudo-code example used fd[0]
twice.  Thanks.  You can stop emailing me now. :)

I've got about fifteen books with names like that, but
strangely in real world situations I keep trying to
use the man pages instead.  Sad, I know...

Hmmm.  And the reason these cool toys aren't available
as some kind of wrapper around a normal read-from-fd
is...?  (Performance?)

This occurred to me in the car on the way home after
five hours messing with this.   (Of course. :)

Thanks.
Info.  Never thought to check info.  Here I am
checking linuxdoc's howtos, man pages, and google... 
Sigh...  I don't suppose there's an info2html tool
anywhere?
Well what do you know, there is.  (I LIKE Google.)
