Possibly a library can do that (placing the context in thread local 
storage), but I see your point.

I'd be surprised if this isn't dominated by the cost of serving the 
request, even from cache.
If we can persuade the aio maintainers to add some flag to io_submit() 
which makes the request synchronous, it would reduce the overhead 
somewhat, but it is against the spirit of aio.

Hopefully they will supercede aio_read/aio_write?
BTW, don't databases like using many many files for their backing store? 
The ability to write to many fds in one call should be attractive to them.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
