Yes, it is planned as soon as I will accumulate enough of stamina 8)
Actually, I think it will look like:
	ip route flush SELECTOR
where SELECTOR is the similar to SELCTOR used in "ip route ls"
(probably, enhanced) and will allow to flush routes by set of conditions:
prefix set, nexthop, device, protocol etc.

It is pretty strange, but "flush" option persists in "route" helper
for years, which apparently means, that nettools maintainers really
all the time planned to implement it. 8)

	No.
