An msleep will slow down this process, but do nothing about slowing
down the amount of logging.  Simply fork a few more processes and all
you are doing with msleep is polluting the pid space.
What about a throttling similar to what ia64 does for floating point
assist faults (handle_fpu_swa()).  There is a thread flag to not log
the events at all.  It is rate throttled globally, but uses per cpu
variables for early exits.  This algorithm scaled well to a thousand
cpus.
I think this may be a good fit.
Good Luck,
Robin
