Hi,
	testing on i386, I get the following error :
...
  CC      mm/slab.o
mm/slab.c: In function `cache_alloc_refill':
mm/slab.c:2093: error: structure has no member named `nodeid'
mm/slab.c: In function `free_block':
mm/slab.c:2239: error: structure has no member named `nodeid'
mm/slab.c:2239: error: `node' undeclared (first use in this function)
mm/slab.c:2239: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
mm/slab.c:2239: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[4]: *** [mm/slab.o] Erreur 1
...
You removed nodeid in the slab struct, but many functions use it.
