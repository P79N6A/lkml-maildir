Try making EHCI a module and modprobe it after booting the kernel. I
have a mainboard/USB stick combo which refuses to work when plugged in
during cold boot with EHCI driver in kernel. The driver repeatedly tried
to reset USB hardware and then gave up. Replugging did work however.
I worked around the issue by booting without EHCI driver in kernel. A more
modern USB stick fixed it too. After some investigation consensus was that
the hardware combination was broken and the EHCI driver was not at fault.
Maybe this is a similar hardware problem. Does the USB disk has its
own power? then replugging USB may not be enough and you might also
need to toggle USB disk power in order to make it work again.
