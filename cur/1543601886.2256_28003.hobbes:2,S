Yes, I saw this and I keep looking at those, some day I might even
try them. :-)
The main problem for me now is that the current ACPI code does pretty
nothing on my laptop (Sony Vaio C1VE): no battery status, no event
recorded etc... This was already reported on the acpi list some
time ago.
I'm adding a CC: to the ACPI list just in case someone has an idea
on how to make ACPI working for me. If this is not an already known
problem just tell me and I will compile an ACPI enabled kernel again
and give additionnal details / debug info.
Stelian.
