It's even more constrained than that. It only applies to the MPOL_BIND
policy when kernelcore= is specified. The other policies work the same
as they ever did.

For 2.6.23 at least, it'll be "not much". While I'm not keen on leaving
MPOL_BIND as it is for 2.6.23, we can postpone the final decision until
we've bashed the one-zonelist-per-node patches a bit and see do we want to
do that instead.

And it's simplier than the one-zone-list-per-node patches. The
current draft of the patch I'm working on looks something like;
