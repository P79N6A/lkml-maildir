Subject: ACPI blacklisting code in 2 places

Hi!
Currently, acpi blacklisting code has 3 (!) components:
drivers/acpi/blacklist.c
arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c -- code based on bios date
arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c -- code based bios name
. Thats messy. For example drivers/acpi/blacklist.c knows my toshiba
bios is okay (it knows it contains non-fatal errors), but BIOS date
code overrides it, and simulates user doing acpi=off. So system tells
me I have non-fatal errors and then behaves like I passed
acpi=off. Ouch.
Part 1: include acpi.h to dmi_scan.c; dmi_scan and acpi layer both
want to have function called acpi_disable, rename dmi_scan's one. (It
matches rest of file better, anyway).
Please apply,
								Pavel
