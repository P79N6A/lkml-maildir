Humans like to know what their machines are doing.
Simple as that:  it's for the end-users, and the place they look
for it is always /proc/cpuinfo (since that works on every platform
and on kernels prior to the 2.[56].* series.
Not useful as an accurate number for any programming algorithms,
but it is used to satisfy human curiosity.  A lot.
