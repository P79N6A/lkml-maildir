Here's an update.  I never lost control of the machine, so after about 24
hours I decided to try to fix it without the use of the Big Red
Switch.  There were still > 1000 connections showing, and pstools were
unresponsive, so I did:
ls /proc > killscript
added "kill -9" to the beginning and "\" to the end of each line,
ran it as the database user.  It worked pretty well.  After about 5
minutes it killed all of the oracle processes and the machine appeared to
have returned to normal.  I've since installed Oracle 81610 and everything
looks good.
