The core of generic_file_buffered_write is 
do {
	grab_cache_page();
	a_ops->prepare_write();
	copy_from_user();
	a_ops->commit_write();
	
	filemap_set_next_iovec();
	balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited();
} while (count);
Would it make sence to rework this code with adding new address_space
operation - fill_pages so that looks like:
do {
	a_ops->fill_pages();
	filemap_set_next_iovec();
	balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited();
} while (count);
generic implementation of fill_pages would look like:
generic_fill_pages()
{
	grab_cache_page();
	a_ops->prepare_write();
	copy_from_user();
	a_ops->commit_write();
}
I believe that filesystem developers will want to exploit that
operation. 
Any opinion on this plan is welcomed. I would try to code whatever we
will have developed (I hope) in result of this discussion.
