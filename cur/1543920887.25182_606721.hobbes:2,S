And just what happens if another task calls the same while we are
blocked on allocation in smk_cipso_doi()?
Another problem is your handling of smk_known - you add to head under
mutex; fine.  However, you read without one _and_ have no barriers
in initializing new list entries.
Think what happens if CPU1 adds to list and CPU2 sees write to smk_known
*before* it sees write to ->smk_next.  We see a single-element list and
we'll be lucky if that single entry won't be FUBAR.
