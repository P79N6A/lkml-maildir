"api" is actually a static array that is not zero_terminated by
convention. It can be zero-terminated, though. This check avoids
overrunning the loop if MAX_TS_FILTER_CHAIN filters are used.
This snippet is taken from mach-gta02.c (link below) and
"filter_sequence" is what
we pass as the "api" array.
static struct s3c2410_ts_mach_info gta02_ts_cfg = {
        .delay = 10000,
        .presc = 0xff, /* slow as we can go */
        .filter_sequence = {
                [0] = &ts_filter_group_api,
                [1] = &ts_filter_median_api,
                [2] = &ts_filter_mean_api,
                [3] = &ts_filter_linear_api,
        },
        .filter_config = {
                [0] = &gta02_ts_group_config,
                [1] = &gta02_ts_median_config,
                [2] = &gta02_ts_mean_config,
                [3] = &gta02_ts_linear_config,
        },
};

http://git.openmoko.org/?p=kernel.git;a=shortlog;h=stable-tracking
This branch is tracking the upstream Linux kernel and patches are
rebased/updated
when things change upstream. Openmoko has been doing this since one
goal is to be able to use upstream kernels with no patches for OM
devices.
This is the driver can use the filters (s3c2410_ts.c) if they are
defined in the machine configuration:
http://git.openmoko.org/?p=kernel.git;a=blob_plain;f=drivers/input/touchscreen/s3c2410_ts.c;hb=stable-tracking
We are ready to send this driver upstream but before we need to trim
this file (mach-gta02.c) and send it:
http://git.openmoko.org/?p=kernel.git;a=blob_plain;f=arch/arm/mach-s3c2440/mach-gta02.c;hb=stable-tracking
We are depending on this mach-gta02.c file now and a streamlined
version of it must be sent upstream so that we can start adding
drivers. This file in turn depends on patches that are being sent
upstream also.
Thus we have a chicken and egg problem and we decided to send the
filters for review because they are in the stable-tracking branch and
they need to be suitable for upstream inclusion / included upstream.

It is actually an array. This name is misleading, we will change it.
struct ts_filter *tsf[MAX_TS_FILTER_CHAIN];
Defined here (s3c2410_ts.c : 113).

Ok.

Ok.
I will a little before resubmitting.
Thanks for your comments.
