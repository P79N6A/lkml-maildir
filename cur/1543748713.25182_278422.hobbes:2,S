I doubt you can distinguish these two (with the exception of looking at the 
ELF header of a file), because
	mov eax, 12345;
is valid for classic IA-32 -and- amd64, just as "mov ax,12" works for
any >= 80286.

I do not see a reason why I would want to know this kind of information ATM, 
so this is something you will probably have keep in your own tree.
Basically, it is possible, you probably have to patch fs/binfmt_elf.c
a little to store a flag whether an ELF32 or ELF64 is currently being 
executed, and store it preferably in current->some_var_name;
Then you will also need to poke in fs/proc/* to export this information to 
userspace, otherwise there is no meaning in patching the task struct.
