This patch series enables on-demand report generation of export symbol usage by
inkernel modules.
A report generated by executing 
 	make allmodconfig
 	make exportcheck
is available at 
http://www.sudhaa.com/~ram/misc/new_export_report.txt
The same report can also be generated by executing from the top level
directory:
	perl scripts/export_report.pl
This report lists:
1. the usage count of all exported symbols by in-kernel modules.
2. For each in-kernel module lists
	a) the in-kernel modules it depend on.
	b) list of exported symbols from that in-kernel modules it depend on.
Highlights: 
	On x86 architecture
 	(1) 880 exported symbols not used by any in-kernel modules.
        (2) 1792 exported symbols used only once.
Thanks to Adrian Bunk, Arjan, Sam Ravnborg, Dagfinn Ilmari for their
valuable comments. All comments have been incorporated.
