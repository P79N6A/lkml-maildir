Please don't intoroduce new new typedefs, especially not for pointer
types.

Wrong interface.  Please pass in the pci_dev of the grpahics cards and
add a new method for lowlevel drivers to find the bridge.  For the normal
bridges (aka everything but the hp, alpha and your new driver) you'd do
a generic helper that just walks down the parent pointers until it finds
a class.
Also I'd suggest returning the found bridges as return value of the
function.

pointers should be printed using %p, but this isn't a place where you should
print it at all.
