Right. We shouldn't feed 1048576-12 bytes into zlib and expect the
output to fit into our 1048576-byte buffer. We could get away with that
kind of thing when we were using Z_SYNC_FLUSH but we can't now.
But now we're not using Z_SYNC_FLUSH it doesn't matter if we feed the
input in smaller chunks. We can calculate a conservative estimate of the
amount we'll fit, and keep feeding it input till the amount of space
left in the output buffer is 12 bytes.
