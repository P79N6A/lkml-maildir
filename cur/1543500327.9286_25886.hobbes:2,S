 This "exceptionally clever soul" was nobody less than Linus
 Torvalds... I just wonder why the hell such bright guys as you
 complain about ANYTHING in developer kernel. 
 Just for you:
 The filesystem layer is being modified to allow more perfomant systems
 in the future which unfortunately broke some filesystems which will be
 fixed soon, I guess. In the time in between you love it or leave it.
 My advise: Stick with 2.2.10 and wait for 2.4....
Servus,
