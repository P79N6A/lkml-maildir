Here, I'm not certain that gcc will optimize the divide. It would be better
anyway to write this which is equivalent, and a pure integer comparison :
+	jtimeout = timeout < 0 || timeout >= 1000 * MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT / HZ ?
>  		MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT: (timeout * HZ + 999) / 1000;
gcc will also spit a warning if the constant is too big for an int,
depending on MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT and HZ, while in the previous case,
it would remain silent, and possibly, timeout/1000 would never reach
the limit.

Willy
