Let me be more precise then.
The commands
	blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sdb
	mount /dev/sdb1 /f -t msdos
	mv /f/dcim/100mlt01/* .
	umount /f
copy the digital camera images written by a Minolta from a Compact Flash
card to the current directory and empty the card. This is the part that
works beautifully (since it works).
(One of these days I must look more at the rereadpt part of this.
After removing the card, I still have the partition /dev/sdb1,
which is an error.)
