Andrew,
Here is my original __block_write_full_page patch which adds
a wait_on_buffer() to catch the case where i/o might be in flight
from ll_rw_block().
I know that it waits for i/o even the non-blocking writebacks, but
it does make sure filemap_write_and_wait() and  filemap_fdatawrite /
filemap_fdatawait() do wait for all i/o that has been submitted to
complete. (This similar to 2.4 which always does a lock_buffer()).
The direct_read_under test does not see uninitialized data with
this patch.  Without this patch 2.6.3-rc2-mm1 still sees uninitialized
data.
I am worried that the current behavior where PageWriteback can be
cleared with i/o still in flight for a buffer on that page could cause
other problems.
I am still trying to figure out how to fix this some other way,
but, in the mean time, this makes sure the code is correct.
Thoughts?
re-diff against 2.6.3-rc2-mm1.
Daniel
