I share the same worry. Towards the end of the bisect run (something like the
4-th last reboot), I was asked to try "2.6.24". Now, I _thought_ 2.6.24 was way
before 852738f39258deafb3d89c187cb1a4050820d555, and hence it should be called
2.X.Y-foobaz something as the others were. Is this the way it should be, or did
I fscked up the bisect?
This was a bisect run between 852738f39.. and 2.5.25-rc1. I got a string of 
"bad"s but TWO goods, actually. Those goods sustained a number of reruns of 
smartd (I can share the BISECT_LOG if wanted).
And how we can end up with good_start+1 as the guilty one, and STILL have two 
good ones during the bisect run..... That's beyond me. lets just say that my 
faith in myself and/or bisect starts to decline...
Now I'm considering a 2.6.24 .. 8527 run.
