Processing below changes arguments, not semantics of generated shell
code. And IMHO this is more reliable way of doing things. If one really
wants silence without commonly accepted ">/dev/null 2>&1" practice, then
choose portable "-n" argument for `echo`.
- quiet_chk_filechk = echo '  CHK     $@'
-silent_chk_filechk = :
- quiet_upd_filechk = echo '  UPD     $@'
-silent_upd_filechk = :
+quiet_chk_filechk = '  CHK     $@'
+quiet_upd_filechk = '  UPD     $@'
+
 define filechk
 	$(Q)set -e;				\
-	$($(quiet)chk_filechk);			\
+	echo $($(quiet)chk_filechk);		\
 	mkdir -p $(dir $@);			\
 	$(filechk_$(1)) < $< > $@.tmp;		\
 	if [ -r $@ ] && cmp -s $@ $@.tmp; then	\
 		rm -f $@.tmp;			\
 	else					\
-		$($(quiet)upd_filechk);		\
+		echo $($(quiet)upd_filechk);	\
 		mv -f $@.tmp $@;		\
 	fi
