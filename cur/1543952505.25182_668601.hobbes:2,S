Bah. Ok, I've talked myself out of this one. 
I still think it crufts up the clocksource structure, but its more
consistent that we follow the established cruft (such as the
pre-calculated cycle_interval/xtime_interval/raw_interval combo) rather
then me trying to arbitrarily draw the line in the sand at this
variable.

I still think pulling out all of the non-counter-abstraction bits out of
the clocksource and into a mid-level timekeeping_clock structure would
still be ideal here, but I'll save our time/energy on that one for
another day. :)
