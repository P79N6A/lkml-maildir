Thanks.  I'd been looking at this for a while but hadn't got round tuit yet.

I raised this with Linus back when he did the original iomap() stuff.
Unfortunately, I think he ignored the question ;-)
My thought on this is that we should encode the endianness of the
registers in the ioremap cookie.  Some architectures (sparc, I think?) can
do this in their PTEs.  The rest of us can do it in our ioread/writeN
methods.  I've planned for this in the parisc iomap implementation but
not actually implemented it.
It doesn't look too hard so I'll commit something to the parisc tree
later that'll let you iomap a BE area.  Do we have any cards that need to be
accessed in a BE way on a LE machine?  (ie x86)

conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
