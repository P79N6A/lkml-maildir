howdy,
i'm doing some research with the kernel on fragmentation and
performance.  we are trying to measure performance of fragmented versus
unfragmented datagrams.  nfs seemed like a first place to start, since it
sends fragments in reverse order by default (which we're interested
in) and since it has configurable datagram size.  (given some of the
troubles that we're having, these may not be sufficient).
so here's the problem:  there do not seem to be datagrams of any
singificant size being sent.
the mount command is:
mount -o rsize=8192,wsize=8192 staff.nm.or:/tmp /mnt/stafftmp
this is the tcpdump output of:
dd if=/dev/urandom of=./tempfile bs=1024 count=500

so, as far as i can tell, the max datagram size is never over 3K, even
though the mount was with 8K (this remains true even when the rsize and
wsize are 64K).
any ideas?
thanks,
