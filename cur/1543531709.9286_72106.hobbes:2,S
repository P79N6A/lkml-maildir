Hello people,
Recently I've had occasion to try to make the QoS and queueing
code from the 2.2 kernel to work for me, but found the 
documentation to be a bit technical and not really aimed for 
users. So, I've summed up my experience with the packet
shaping and stuffed it all into a HOWTO.
However some of it is still guess work since there are some
concepts going on here that I still don't get. No matter,
I would just like people to read over it to see if I got
it right.
Note that this is specifically 2.2, I don't know if 
2.[34] is the same.
