Perhaps the teachers don't prepare you well enough but are not aware of
this issue.  Also, if you go as far as asking people here to show you
example code (rather than for example posting your own draft code or
pseudo code and asking for comments), does this still count as
researching on your own?

Yes, but AFAIU with the primary goal of you learning something, rather
than to advance the Linux program.  So, kernelnewbies might be a better
list; but still, I am more irritated about /what/ you ask.
A few comments on your earlier posts:

To find out how things work in a complex C program like the kernel,
tools like LXR and cscope/ kscope can be quite helpful.  In particular,
they help navigate between definitions and call sites.

Why back the shared memory with a file?  Wouldn't a memory buffer suffice?
