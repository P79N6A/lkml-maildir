Well, it depends if you consider my 686MX PR233+ "non-modern" or not. I
bought about 14-16 months ago. It's already listed as "legacy" on the Cyrix
site, much to my irritation :)

I think because there are so many out there, the problems get found more
often. I've heard horror stories about the SPARC processors, for example,
where you could pretty much pull an invalid opcode out of your hat and 
discover it would crash the processor in some interesting way.
Are we off-topic yet?
