Responding to your post, but I guess it's really Oracle I'm asking:
On my first glance just now at the git-ocfs patch, I was surprised that
what seemed to be separable facilities were combined into one patch.  I
see a file system, a lock manager (is that what DLM stands for - please
spell out acronyms)  and a configuration file system.
+configfs/
+       - directory containing configfs documentation and example code.
  ...
+dlmfs.txt
+       - info on the userspace interface to the OCFS2 DLM.
  ...
+ocfs2.txt
+       - info and mount options for the OCFS2 clustered filesystem.
These combine to make a 45 thousand line patch.  That's a big patch.
Only the netdev and reiser4 patches (and the combined linus.patch)
are bigger.
Shouldn't these be 3 patches, or more?
