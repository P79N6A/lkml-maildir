I have hopes that a single solution can happily solve all the cases.  At
their core, all of these tasks are essentially the same - file change
notification - and it seems redundant to implement multiple file change
systems in the kernel.
I've looked into more "indexing" specific solutions and you see both
races and security issues when you move away from the subscribe-to-
watch-each-inode model.
That said, I personally don't have any reason for wanting a single
solution, except that because it is cleaner/simpler/smaller/etc it has a
better chance of success.  If you have code that speaks different, then
great!
