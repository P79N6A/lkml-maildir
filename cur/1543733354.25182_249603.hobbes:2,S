No, it's not unfortunately. gcc is aligning the stack 
to 8 bytes for floating point. It would if you compiled the file with 
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=4. Actually AFAIK this is only useful
for floating point anyways, so it would be a good idea to always
compile the kernel with this option.
On x86-64 it should just work.
