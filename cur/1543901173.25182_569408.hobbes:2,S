Subject: [PATCH] Include serial_reg.h with userspace headers

Hi,
As reported by Gustavo de Nardin <gustavodn@mandriva.com.br>, while trying to 
compile xosview (
http://xosview.sourceforge.net/
) with upstream kernel 
headers being used you get the following errors:
serialmeter.cc:48:30: error: linux/serial_reg.h: No such file or directory
serialmeter.cc: In member function 'virtual void 
SerialMeter::checkResources()':
serialmeter.cc:71: error: 'UART_LSR' was not declared in this scope
serialmeter.cc:71: error: 'UART_MSR' was not declared in this scope
...
I don't know if it's right to provide serial_reg.h with userspace headers, may 
be serial_reg.h isn't included for some reason. But if it's ok, the following 
patch adds serial_reg.h to be installed with user space kernel headers:
=================================================
  Add serial_reg.h to userspace kernel headers
  Include serial_reg.h in kernel headers for user space, it is at least
  needed for one program, xosview.
