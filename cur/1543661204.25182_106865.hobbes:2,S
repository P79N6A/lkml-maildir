uhmm, 1th try to upgrade to a newer one, then I experienced the same problem with a
custom board... the problem was triggered by the Base Address too high:
  Region 0: Memory at 10812000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
moving id_sel (in the PCI core of the board) in order to obtain a lower bar all worked.
BTW, has anybody there ever heared about such a costraint in the PCI specification ??
Why I got this strange behaviour ???
