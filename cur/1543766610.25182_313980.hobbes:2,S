I've argued for folding shutdown and suspend for some time now, though
some drivers who rely on shutdown today will need fixing I suppose.
Also, I think kexec shouldn't use "shutdown" but a different message.
There are some conceptual differences, things like stopping the platters
on disk etc... things you want to do on one and not the other. In a way,
kexec needs are very similar to suspend-to-disk "freeze" state. I'd
rather call PMSG_FREEZE there.
Ben.
