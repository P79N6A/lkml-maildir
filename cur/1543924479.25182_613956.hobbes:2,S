Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Remove duplicated include
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch series removes some duplicated #include found by a script.
The whole tree has been checked but 'arch' and 'drivers' directories.
In case someone is interested I can provide patches also for the
missing directories
