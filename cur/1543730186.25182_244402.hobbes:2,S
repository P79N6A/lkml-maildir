I don't do that, but unfortunately people with more knowlede seem to be rare on 
LKML :-(
If people on LKML would admit that other people may have more knowledge than 
they, discussions on LKML could be much easier.......
And if you look at the mails from Sunday, you even see what's happening when 
typical LKML trolls stop posting.
