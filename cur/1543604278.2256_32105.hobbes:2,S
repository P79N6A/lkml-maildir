Subject: [PATCH] fbcon.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch avoids some warnings during compile. The block where the vars are 
used is ifdefed out so here they are ifdefed out too. The patch is against 
2.4.11 but should apply to earlier 2.4 too, I remember this warnings from 
other 2.4.x.
