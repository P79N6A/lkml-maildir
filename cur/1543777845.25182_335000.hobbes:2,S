So the size you want to reflect is n*<stack-depth> i take it?  Where
in this case n is 20?
So you can seek to m*<stack-depth>+<offset> to access an offset into
something at depth m?

I really don't know why tmpfs is doing this.

With what defined semantics?  What if an entry is added in between
seek and readdir?

I'm not sure how expecting a meaningful offset into a directory can
have consistent bahvior.

Why?  It seems perfectly reasonable that we can return 0 in such
cases.  Zero seems to make more sense as 'magical/unknown' than say
any other arbitrary value.
It's also possible a regular filesystem could return an arbitrary
value such as 20 (not that this directly matters except it becomes
confusing potentially):

    cw@taniwha:~$ ls -ld foobar
    drwxr-xr-x  2 cw cw 6 Jul 19 11:29 foobar
    cw@taniwha:~$ mkdir foobar/1234567
    cw@taniwha:~$ ls -ld foobar
    drwxr-xr-x  3 cw cw 20 Jul 19 11:30 foobar
