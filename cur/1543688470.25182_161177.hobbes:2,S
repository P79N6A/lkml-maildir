Patched the -mm2 kernel and perceive/see no regression during my usual
tests. In fact, I _believe_ the anti-starvation is even better now,
compared to O18.1
The new Blender 2.28a could be thrown into a self-starvation by altering
a few parameters in my test, resulting in the usual short freezes. And
2.28 behaved the same, although a bit harder to make it happen.
The altered test have no effect on either Blender with this O19int.
