In your previous letter you wanted to play semantical tricks with the
word recursive, even though you understood perfectly well what I meant
with "nonrecursive" (and you yourself used the same terminology in older
posts).
Now I hesitate whether I should react to the above statement.
Maybe this time there are semantical tricks with the word active,
but it sounds a bit as if you misunderstand the situation.
Let me state the facts instead of worrying about semantics.
The routine link_path_walk() in namei.c will call do_follow_link()
in case of a symlink, and this routine will call
	dentry->d_inode->i_op->follow_link(),
say, nfs_follow_link(), which calls vfs_follow_link(),
which calls link_path_walk(), etc.
You see that in a stack of N invocations, there will also
be N stack frames of foofs_follow_link().
So, yes, in the way I use recursive, routines like nfs_follow_link()
are indeed recursive: they end up calling themselves.
Last Sunday or so I gave a demo patch that takes the filesystems
out of the loop. Then symlink resolution is still recursive but
there will be at most one invocation of foofs_follow_link().
Yesterday I showed that it is also easy to avoid recursion altogether.
These are independent stages, and one might consider doing one
and not the other.

[Now that I write anyway, let me address others:
(i) The "depth" that is limited by 5 is the number of symlinks
that is being resolved at the same time; there is a much larger
limit (40) on the total number of symlinks resolved during a
path lookup.
(ii) 5 sounds like a very small number, but a Google search turns
up very few people who have problems. It would be nice to be able
to say "echo 32 > /proc/sys/fs/max-symlink-depth" to get a different
limit, and with the present implementation that is impossible,
but the fact remains that it is not a real problem that many people
have problems with. This is more a scalability problem.]
