hrmph.  Of course it's a reasonable trick from a performance and
convenience and resource consumption POV.  But it's a new idiom and the
threshold for new idioms is non-zero.  We use it in struct page, but struct
page is special.
It does need really obvious commenting.  Pity the poor person who spends
ten miniutes trying to find the definition of struct key_ref.

Yup.  Logically we shouldn't use PTR_ERR unless IS_ERR is known to be true.
Yes, it works and yes, it'll surely continue to work.  But.

OK.

It doesn't fix any bugs (does it?).  Hence according to the shiny new rules
this work is 2.6.15 material.
