Hi, I have a quick question.
In 2.4 kernel, can generic_make_request sleep?
I read the 2.4.24 kernel and find that there is printk in it. so i
assume it can sleep. if so, why the per queue make_request_fn can not
sleep base on the LDD book? and i do not see any place that the
io_request_lock is held. is this lock removed from system? or we do not
need this lock at this place any more?
and in md code, it use blk_queue_make_request to use its own request_fn
instead a queue, for example, in raid1_make_request(), it calls
raid1_alloc_r1ch() which also call schedule() if need, then this own
request_fn can sleep?
i think i am little confused about the LDD (linux device driver 2nd)
book and the new kernel code. can anybody point out some latest
reference for me?
thanks a bunch.
