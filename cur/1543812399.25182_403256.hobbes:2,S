Yes, Device-Mapper can only map to block-devices. If you need to do this with 
files, you could use losetup to create block-device from them. However, the 
COW device still won't "grow" automatically as you described.

Device-Mapper does not directly support this, but EVMS provides a "rollback" 
function for reverting an origin volume back to the contents of its snapshot 
volume.
