This is what top looks like with my (now fixed) scheduler
(priorities go from 0 to 59). In theory I guess it looks like what
you want.
  920 root      21 -10 88156  17m  79m S 50.8  7.0  11:08.47 XFree86
16762 npiggin   40   0  4804 2396 4356 R 37.9  0.9   0:07.76 xterm
16784 npiggin   23   0  3128 1212 2664 S  9.3  0.5   0:01.93 perl
xterm is a CPU hog, XFree86 is half and half, perl is at close to highest
priority (which is 20 for a nice 0 process). When using xterm without jump
scrolling, it seems to mess up X's scheduler by flooding it with so many
small requests.
