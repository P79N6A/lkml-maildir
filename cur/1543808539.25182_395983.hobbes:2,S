After a little lie down :-),  I now think that this problem has been 
misdiagnosed and the actual problem is that movement of high priority 
tasks on lightly loaded systems is supressed by this patch rather than 
it causing such tasks to hop from CPU to CPU.
The reason that I think this is that the implementation of biased_load() 
makes it a likely outcome.  As a shortcut to converting weighted load to 
biased load it assumes the the average weighted load per runnable task 
is 1 (or, equivalently, that the average biased prio per runnable is 
NICE_TO_BIAS_PRIO(p)) and this means that if there's only one task to 
move and its nice value is less than zero (i.e. it's high priority) then 
the biased load to be moved that is calculated will be smaller than that 
task's bias_prio causing it to NOT be moved by move_tasks().
Do you have any direct evidence to support your "hopping" hypothesis or 
is my hypothesis equally likely?
If my hypothesis holds there is a relatively simple fix that would 
involve modifying biased_load() to take into account rq->prio_bias and 
rq->nr_running during its calculations.  Basically, in that function, 
(wload * NICE_TO_BIAS_PRIO(0)) would be replaced by (wload * 
rq->prio_bias / rq->nr_running) which would, in turn, create a 
requirement for rq to be passed in as an argument.
If there is direct evidence of hopping then, because of my hypothesis 
above, I would shift the suspicion from find_busiest_group() to 
try_to_wake_up().
