Well, I think it's a fertile ground for hole hunters out there.  Just
needs a little publicity ;)
Is it considered DoS for example if I prevent other users from sending
email?  SIGSTOP on sendmail at the right moment (when the database is
locked) should do it fine.

On a well protected multiuser system there will be ulimits in place to
prevent that.

Killing always works, if the sysadmin happens to be around.  If not
then there's not a lot other users can do.

You mean suid programs are never to touch paths passed to them?
If that would be true, then fuse_allow_task() would not be needed, but
would do no harm either, since it would never be invoked by a suid
program.

You didn't consider the information leak aspect (point B in fuse.txt).

KILL will always interrupt a request.  So getting rid of a malicious
mount should present no problems.

Yes.  It checks for writablilty on the mountpoing (excluding limited
writablilty as /tmp for example).

Been there.  People (like Al Viro) didn't like it.
