Hello
I'm wondering about this change in smbfs:
-		mnt->uid = OLD_TO_NEW_UID(oldmnt->uid);
-		mnt->gid = OLD_TO_NEW_GID(oldmnt->gid);
+		SET_UID(mnt->uid, oldmnt->uid);
+		SET_GID(mnt->gid, oldmnt->gid);
"OLD_TO_NEW_UID" took an old 16bit uid and returned a uid_t
(using low2highuid when appropriate).
SET_UID(var, uid) wants uid to be uid_t and may decide to use high2lowuid.
Was low2highuid not needed in the first place or is the change wrong?
It gives a compile warning about the comparison.
Bitkeeper lists the author as "ak@de[torvalds]". But it also says I'm 11
weeks late and that can't possibly be true ... :)
