the problem is as usual we need to work with pages or pfn somewhere (see
pte_alloc), we cannot work with virtual addresses or we'll overflow...
the pte_t * virtual address is always the result of the kmap, so the
changes required are the minimal as possible in most places, and I made
a pte_kunmap smart enough to be able to unmap any kind of kmap so the
common code changes are as simple as possible, but still pmd_populate
needs to know the whole thing (struct page * actually) and probably some
other bit of the same kind with the pmd breaks too.
