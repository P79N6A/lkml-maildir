This works a lot better than both -mm1 and stock 2.6.0's mouse behavior
for me; 2.6.0 likes to drop packets inside the interrupt handler and make
the mouse jump to the edge of the screen, and 2.6.0-mm1 likes to move the
pointer between the time I take my finger off the touchpad and hit the
mouse button.  This appears to fix both issues; however, I still see the
following in logs:
