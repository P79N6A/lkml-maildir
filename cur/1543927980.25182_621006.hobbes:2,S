I wouldn't say creating an account (if you don't already have one)
plus 5 additional mouse clicks per bug report are substancially more 
work.

How should a newbie find the correct mailing list?

Easier than the "some more work" when using Bugzilla.

If you don't already know MAINTAINERS well then finding the right

What about recommending a cronjob that resends the bug report every 
three days?   ;-)
Really, we must define _one_ way for people to report a bug, and how 
developers are reminded is _our_ job.

If you expect people to read and follow this, wouldn't it be easier to
simply point them to open the bug in Bugzilla where we already have a
template asking these questions?
You could replace the whole contents of this file with:
Go to 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/
 and click on "Enter a new bug report".
It's a pity that we manage to add/change an average of 100.000 bugs^Wlines
of code each month, but do not have one generally accepted and working 
process for bug reports.
