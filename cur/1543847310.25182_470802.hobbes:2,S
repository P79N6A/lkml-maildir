Thanks. Yeah hopefully this provides a little more flexibility (I think 
it can
already replace 3 individual vm_ops callbacks!). And I'd like to see 
what other
things it can be used for... :)
However, what we don't want is a bloating of struct fault_data IMO. So 
I'd like
to try to nail down the fields that it needs quite quickly then really 
keep a
lid on it.
