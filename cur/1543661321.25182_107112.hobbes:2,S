This is a royal pain - there's been a "linux
ssh hang patch" floating around for ages -
None of the linux vendors seem to want to
fix it, and the openssh maintainers don't
seem to want to fix it - grrr.
BTW we some demoronized ssh 3.4p1 rpms
available for suse and redhat - if it will ease
somebody's pain, feel free to grab them -
