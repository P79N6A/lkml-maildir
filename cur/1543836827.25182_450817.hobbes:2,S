It's actually incorrect to just "restore" the previous timings. In many
case, the disk will have been reset too. The safe thing is to force the
controller in PIO0 mode at resume, and the best place to do that is from
the controller's own resume(), as I do on pmac. It's the parent of the
hwif and thus will be resumed before the later.
Later on, the state machine will redo the tuning to get to a better
speed, including sending the right commands to also reconfigure the
drive.
