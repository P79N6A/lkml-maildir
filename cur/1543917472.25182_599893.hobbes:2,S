Nice. Although the word "DRIVER" may not represent every module, I
think it is the correct option as I suggested, as the word is
meaningful (speaks by itself) and almost every message in the kernel
is printed out by drivers (whatever the big subsystem they belong to:
drivers/,  fs/, net/ ...).

Yep, then, in a year or two, we will be able to delete such attribute.
Will there be a team to change main subsystems/drivers to the new API?
