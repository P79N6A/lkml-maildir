Hi.  Just a quick reply.  Is /proc/bus/usb empty?  Is there no symlink 
named devices (and so you can't cat devices to see what is there)?  
Also, (if /proc/bus/usb is empty), is /dev/bus/usb/devices not empty?  
(When you cat devices does it list usb devices you have plugged in?)  If 
so, then that's the problem I'm having.  Its very similar to yours, 
xsane points to the tv card only (not the scanner).  Something went away 
with the recent kernel.
