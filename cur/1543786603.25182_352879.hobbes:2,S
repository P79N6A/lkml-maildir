After scanning through some of the archs, it seems that the !! is really
necessary in that case. Here's why:
PagePrivate() is just a macro wrapper around test_bit(). On i386, in
include/asm-i386/bitops.h, test_bit() may end up calling
variable_test_bit(). This inline function uses two assembly instructions
to compute the desired result, which end up returning '-1', not '1', in
the case that the bit is set.
(Hopefully this mail gets archived away and saves someone else the work
of digging through the archs.)
