I expect all the kernel logging functions to be
overhauled eventually.
I'd prefer a mechanism that somehow supports
identifying complete messages.  I think the new
pr_<level> functions are not particularly useful
without a mechanism to avoid or identify multiple
processors or threads interleaving partial in-progress
multiple statement messages.
I've got a very large patch series that converts _all_
the current single line messages that use KERN_<level>
to pr_<level> and identifies, prefixes and postfixes
the rest of the multiple source line messages.
At some point, sooner or later, the logging functions
will be improved.  Apparently, more likely later.
cheers, Joe
