Yes, MOVABLE is for things which are very easily moved out, whether that
is migrated to another page, or paged out to swap, or trivially freed as
it can be re-read from somewhere such as text from a binary; generally
this is things on the LRU.
RECLAIMABLE, is things which are harder to get rid of, but for which
there is some hope of evicting their contents; as you say things like
those slab caches with shrinkers.

That sounds correct to me.
