Actually, as IRQ0 will become PER_CPU din broadcast, there are no irq0 lock 
contention. Only contention that can be there is in scheduler idle balancing,
which should not be an issue as the CPU is idle anyway.

Unfortunately no :(. TSC will also stop in C3. Myself and John are working on
another patch to fix TSC based gettimeofday() to handle this (atleast in UP 
case) It is almost impossible in SMP, as TSCs can go out of sync with C3 on SMP.
So, ACPI PM timer or HPET seem to be the only option for backing time.

I haven't seen any issues with cpufreq on APIC timer, as APIC timers run 
based on FSB.

OK. I have some code that I had prototyped to fixup local APIC counts in 
presence of C3s. I guess we can work together and solve this one faster. 
I will send you the patch in a separate mail.

cpufreq_ondemand governor depends on the idle statistics. And due to the 
wrong idle statistics, the governor will keep the CPU frequency at maximum,
loosing all the power advantages of cpufreq. So, question is not a simple 
power savings against accurate atatistics. Accurate statistics is related
to power savings as well...
