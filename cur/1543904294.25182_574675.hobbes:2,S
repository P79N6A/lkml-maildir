it's connected: it would remove updatedb from the VM picture altogether. 
(updatedb would just cycle through the files with leaving minimal cache 
disturbance.)
hence swap-prefetch could concentrate on the cases where it makes sense 
to start swap prefetching _without_ destroying other, already cached 
content: such as when a large app exits and frees gobs of memory back 
into the buddy allocator. _That_ would be a definitive "no costs and 
side-effects" point for swap-prefetch to kick in, and it would eliminate 
this pretty artificial (and unnecessary) 'desktop versus server' 
controversy and would turn it into a 'helps everyone' feature.
