Well, modern SATA devices are already mini-filesystems internally, when 
you consider logical block remapping etc.
And the claim by drive research guys at the filesystem/storage summit 
was that OSD offered the potential to better optimize storage based on 
access/usage patterns.

I am actually considering writing a simple "osdblk" driver, that would 
represent a single object as a block device.
This would NOT replace exofs or other OSD filesystems, but it would be 
nice to have, and it will give me more experience with OSDs.
