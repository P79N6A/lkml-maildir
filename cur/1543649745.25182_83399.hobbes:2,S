Well, I forgot acpiphp driver was removed in this driver patch :)
acpiphp is also for DIG64/ACPI and will do for some DIG64/ACPI machines
while intcphp is feature full driver for IPF platform PHP.

ACPI IS mandatory for DIG64 PHP resource management by SHPC, while ACPI
based slot operation is not required.
The above sentence only could be misleading.

intcphp is desined with SHPC on plan in terms of ACPI resource management,
as SHPC spec says
"DIG64 compliant platforms must use ACPI to describe resource allocation."
But it is not completely ready for SHPC yet. It's a matter of deployment
schedules of dependencies such as HPRT, ACPI methods OSHP, HBRB, etc which
will need to be enabled in Linux kernel ACPI driver/platform firmware.

\o/ second to this :)
