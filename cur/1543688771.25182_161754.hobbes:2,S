Since they would have a high pri still, and preempt is there... it
should be back on the cpu pretty quick.

But, it also creates problems for when a interactive process becomes a
cpu hog. Like this the detection should be faster, but should be slowed
down somewhat.

But, hogs would instead cause a context switch hell and lessen the
throughput on server loads...

Yes, saner imho =)

I don't see how priorities would be questioned... Since, all i say is
that a task that gets preempted should have a guaranteed time on the cpu
so that we don't waste cycles doing context switches all the time. 
I can see that Ingos current scheduler is good from a desktop
standpoint, but having it that way is not warranted when preempt comes
in to the picture (if i correctly understand it's workings)... 
With preempt i actually see no reason for the priority inversion.. And
to answer someone who mailed about this before: "Yes, it does seem to be
slower than my Amigas, esp the ones that use Executive...".
(That feedback scheduler rocks =))
