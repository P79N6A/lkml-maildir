Ugh. Ok.
I was concerned about about the buffer not ending on a well aligned
boundary and someone elses data getting clobbered. But RX buffers are
managed by the OS and I expect them to be well aligned.

Well, you pointed out it needs to be set on bcm5700/01 for it's 
intended purpose.  And it needs to be set on 5703/04 to enable
PCI-X bug workaround.  BE bit "always" needs to be set.
Did you intend to alias the BE constant to another name?
(and then use respective chip version for each constant)
BTW, I don't know what the story is with bcm5705.
thanks,
