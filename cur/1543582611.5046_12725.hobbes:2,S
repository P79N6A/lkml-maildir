This is becoming a FAQ, could we add it as question 14.3 to the lkml
FAQ?
Yes, the processes stil share memory, but due to changes to the VM in
2.4 it became too CPU intensive to calculate the total amount of shared
memory. In order not to break the userland tools, the "MemShared" field
in /proc/meminfo was set to 0.
