Yes. I just confirmed that /proc/sys access is about an order
of magnitude slower.  I goofed and forgot to add you to the
cc list but I just sent a patch to Ulrich to switch glibc to using
uname for this case.  uname is even faster than sysctl.
I am very curious to understand where the overhead is coming
from.  It may just be the VFS or it may be stupidities in
the /proc implementation.  If things are really as bad as
they appear it puts a serious damper on the plan9 style everything
is a filesystem approach.

It shouldn't be.   You can support be thread safe without pulling
in glibc.  But yes it is common.

I will see how it goes.
