I've now booted all -rc kernels from 2.6.8 to 2.6.10-rc3 and examined the 
behaviour of a heavy session with the 3D program Blender with regards to 
screen freezes and mouse unresponsiveness during memory swap.
I find no problem when blender is the sole (large) application, but when a 
distributed computing client is running in the background the reported problems 
surface. I use 
http://folding.stanford.edu
 for protein folding. It runs 
with a default of nice 19 and sucks up every free CPU cycle. I've never 
seen it interfere with anything prior to this swap issue - been running 
it since 2000.
Guess kernel people will say "don't do that then"...
