fsck does seem to fix it, but it won't automatically detect the problem
(since the filesystem is marked clean).
It basically removes the inodes from the disk, but leaves the names in
the directory.  On the next boot, init scripts which clear out certain
directories fail, and various daemons fail to start because of it.
It seems that the only solution is to force a fsck at boot:
	shutdown -F -r now
should do the trick.
