I also had some strange effects with IBM DJNA 15GB/5400RPM and the following
helped:
Try to find ibmata66.exe (or .*) somewhere on www.ibm.com and read the docs.
There seem to be problems with some IBM UATA66 drives when run on controllers
not capable of UATA66 (but "only" UATA33).
Solution:
- jumper drive to use 15 Heads
- use IBMATA66.EXE and disable ATA66 capability of the drive
- use AUTO detection in the BIOS
