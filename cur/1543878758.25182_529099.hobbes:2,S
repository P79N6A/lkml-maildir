On x86 just the real possible map now -- that tends to be much smaller.
There might be some other architectures who still allocate per cpu
for all of NR_CPUs (or always set possible map to that), but those
should be just fixed.

We should have solved the problem of limited per cpu space in .22 at least
with some patches by Jeremy. I also plan a few other changes the will
use more per CPU memory again.

When he avoids false sharing on remote wakeup it should be more cache friendly.

Was this based on some benchmark where it showed?
