Wrong. Having devfs in the kernel has an impact on _all_ devices, if they
use it or not. Giving the option has even more impact here than just
forcing it one way or the other.
A driver is something quite different: If the source is in the kernel or
not has very minimal impact, a few lines outside of the driver itself.
There is does make sense to apply kitchen-sink mentality, with core kernel
functionality is just does not.
