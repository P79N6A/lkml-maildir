A file or file pattern specific to a maintained "subsystem".
Any time a subsystem file pattern matches a file,
maintainers would be cc'd.  The matching is non-exclusive.
Multiple subsystems can include the same file pattern.
For KDUMP, maybe a file pattern should be:
F:	arch/*/kernel/crash_dump.c
F:	include/linux/crash_dump.h

I think it should be files specific to KDUMP and not
files shared with other subsystems but perhaps it's
maintainer taste.
If the files patterns are not specific to kdump,
the kdump maintainers will be cc'd on patches that
change files where kdump functions aren't modified.
The list of files that include crash_dump.h is pretty long.
        $ grep -P -l -r --include=*.[ch] crash_dump.h *
        arch/i386/kernel/crash_dump.c
        arch/i386/kernel/setup.c
        arch/ia64/hp/common/sba_iommu.c
        arch/ia64/kernel/crash.c
        arch/ia64/kernel/setup.c
        arch/powerpc/kernel/crash.c
        arch/powerpc/kernel/crash_dump.c
        arch/sh/kernel/crash_dump.c
        arch/x86_64/kernel/crash_dump.c
        arch/x86_64/kernel/setup.c
        drivers/char/mem.c
        fs/proc/proc_misc.c
        fs/proc/vmcore.c
        
The list of files that use CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP is also
pretty long and seemingly unrelated.
