Hello....is there a restriction on mixing pass-through I/O and standard
block I/O?  
I'm using an inquiry command that goes out to identify and list the
/dev/sg"x" devices which is hanging the machine I'm using.  It's a Dell
PowerEdge 2300 running 2.2.11 w/ tcp.diff patch, 2  450MHz cpu's , 512MB,
4.3GB Seagate, and attached to an external differential storage device
(Symmetrix) via AHA-2944UW.  It appears to be entirely hanging the system
when the inquiry command hits /dev/sga (internal root drive)....no oops or
core dump and no hot keys are available.
Does anyone know of such a restriction?
TIA.
Heather
