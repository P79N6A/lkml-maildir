I just downloaded and compiled the 2.4.18 kernel and it works perfectly. It
must have something to with any changes from 2.4.18 - 2.4.23. I will try
which version up until 2.4.23 that works. I'll keep you posted. Do you know
who I should send this "bug" to in order to get it fixed in the next 2.4.x
version?

Not sure what else to tell you. If the pdcraid driver is compiled into the
kernel, you'll get a message about it during boot, even if it can't find all
the drives. I no longer use the 2.4 kernel series (or pdcraid), so I'm
afraid I'm out of ideas. Maybe somebody else on the list has some other
things to try. Sorry.
