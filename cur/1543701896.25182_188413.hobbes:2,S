Two dimensional discrete space (*) is enumerable. Just start at [0,0]
and assign numbers going around the center in a growing spiral (**).
That way you assign a number to every point in that space. This is very
similar to the trick used to demonstrate fractions are enumerable.
(*)  The one where you can use two integers to look things up.
(**) Assuming the coordinates can be negative. For non-negative
     it's even easier.
