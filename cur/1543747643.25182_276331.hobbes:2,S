Um... if it happens on one controller and not another, the bug
shouldn't be in the drives themselves.  Every Maxtor drive ever made
has a unique serial number, and the ones people are seeing are
completely invalid.
This issue should be root caused, something is getting stomped on, and
it may affect more than just the ID of the drive.  I fear that these
are bandaids covering some underlying issue.
