GPL'd applications would still be covered by the GPL, no?
If I buy their product, I should be able to ask them for the source to 
all GPL'd entities that are present in the system, including the kernel, 
drivers, and all GPL'd userspace apps.
Any *new* apps that they wrote they would of course be free to keep private.
