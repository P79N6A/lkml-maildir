The riser I have here is called "ext-pci rev b" and is marked "Via Tech Inc". 
My understanding is that this is not an "active riser" and requires explicit 
BIOS support.
A quick googling for the device revealed this:

A poster here seems to suggest the following:
"As far as I know the only dual riser card that is supported by the EPIA BIOS 
is the one from VIA (that faces out). That one has some logic on it to get 
both slots working. The upper slot uses device 19 and INT_A, allocated 
through the EPIA BIOS."
This may perhaps describe the issue you are having, and from the PDF you 
linked I do not believe you have a riser that is the same as mine.
