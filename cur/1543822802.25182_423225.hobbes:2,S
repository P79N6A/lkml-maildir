That shouldn't be necessary if add_to_page_cache() also doesn't do that, but
if you wish, I can do that - it's the error handling path, so it doesn't
matter too much performancewise.

Well, the filler_t thing is generally a_ops->readpage from the caller fs, but
we don't want to call that if add_to_page_cache() failed, and we don't want to
call it if we're just discarding a bunch of pages we've now no intention of
actually reading.
I suppose we could add another callback for ditching pages we don't want to
keep.  This has the potential to be called quite a lot because of the way
readahead works on Linux.

Okay... I'll add more comments.  I should probably also extend the
documentation on releasepage().  It won't be till Monday though.

Then the second option is still possible (calling releasepage()
unconditionally).
