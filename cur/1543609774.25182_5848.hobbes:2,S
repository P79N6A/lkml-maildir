hello,
installing samba packages from potato distribution server crashes. It
seams that crash happens when nmbd is started. Besides, this is only on
"sertain" kernel versions (2.2.19, 2.2.20 - crashes, 2.2.18 - doesn't).
I'm not sure if its kernel problem (maybe some modules only), i use
firewalling masquarading enabling modules.
can anyone help this this?
