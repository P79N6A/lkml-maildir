My take on this is that it's premature. This would be fine in the 2.6.0-rc
series, but the truth is that the majority of 2.5 users boot 2.5 for
testing but run 2.4 for normal use. They aren't going to get rid of
bdflush and this just craps up the logs. At least with the occurrence
limit it will only happen a few times. I would like to see it once only,
myself, as a reminder rather than a nag.
While it's possible to do version dependent things in init scripts, in
this case there is no need, the call hurts nothing. Some users may post to
the list asking what it means, and others may actually do it, and break
their production systems.
