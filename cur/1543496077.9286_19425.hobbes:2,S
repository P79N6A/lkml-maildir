Subject: USE_ELCR_TRIGGER_LEVEL removed in 2.2.6 -> linux broken for HP-XU SMP

In 2.2.6 kernel, the USE_ELCR_TRIGGER_LEVEL option has been removed
from io_apic.c
As a result, the kernel (I tested 2.2.9) is completely unreliable
for HP-XU Pentium based SMP PCs.
Lost interrupts lead to SCSI timeout in the DC390 driver, then
various console messages showing the machine freezing:
unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000c
...
Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Kernel panic: Attempted to kill the idle task!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
GAMEOVER.
