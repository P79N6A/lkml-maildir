Subject: [-mm][PATCH 0/6] (yet another) kprobes x86 code unification and boosters
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello all,
I developed a series of patches which unifies kprobes code on x86
and introduces boosters on x86-64. These patches can be applied to 2.6.24-rc4-mm1.
The purpose of this patchset is unifying kprobes_[32|64].[c|h] to kprobes.[c|h]
for simplifying code maintenance.
I know these patches are conflicting with Harvey's patch.
We need to solve that.
kprobe-booster and kretprobe-booster were explained in:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=113862526017068&w=2
Currently, these patches do unification as following order.
1. Clean up and fix bugs in kprobes[1/6, 2/6].
2. Introduce kprobe-booster and kretprobe-booster for x86-64[3/6, 4/6].
   (x86-32 kprobes already has same functionalities)
3. Prepare unification[5/6].
4. Unify kprobes code[6/6].
If you have any comment, please let me know.
Best Regards,
