	Are you familiar w/ kernel isapnp?  Was curious because I was
working on getting the 3c515 network card to support kernel isapnp
but ran into some problems, wanna take a peak at what I did and perhaps
point out what I missed? :)  Basically, it all appears to come up
correctly in the kernel, finds the card, configures it w/ a reasonable
irq and i/o-port, but then when I try and ifconfig the device ifconfig
returns a "No such device" error...
		Thanks!
