There is no problem with his patch.
His patch improves the build process.
And there's no reason to hide this from the users.

There's nothing that requires treatment.
It's a matter of fact that the kernel takes advantages from some 
features of GNU binutils and GNU gcc that might not be available
in other versions of these tools.
Whether you like it or not - that's not going to change.
But don't continue arguing about something where you won't win with 
words - it's open source, so you can always create a fork of the Linux 
kernel that builds with whatever toolchain you want.
The only way you could convince other people from your point of view 
would be if your forked version of the kernel would contain advantages 
that convince many users to use your kernel rather than Linus' one.
