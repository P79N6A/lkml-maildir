actually no. The only overflows seen in reality are with XFS, and Red
Hat doesn't support XFS anyway. The recent fix (not plural) was more a
precaution to let XFS work more reliable.

the problem to some degree is that those people if they hit this, won't
report it most likely. This is a problem because the same overflow can
hit with 8K stacks, just less frequent, so it really needs to be fixed
regardless of what anyone thinks of 4k-vs-8k stacks.

Actually I don't even know if you use ndiswrapper, but some others are
behaving like that; you're one of the "others" who actually try to use
real arguments.

funny you mention this one: iptables/RPC(tcp) actually run in the OTHER
4K stack; this workload has actually LESS chance of an overflow than
before... due to having more space in irq context.

note that I no longer care about this option going away or not; it's not
worth the silly flames (present company excluded ;)
options are good, to a degree. The extreme would be a kernel with 40.000
different config options, one for each patch that goes in. That's of
course silly! The other extreme is the gnome idea that preferences are
bad period. To a degree, Havoc and co are right in that there shouldn't
be a "unbreak my app" option, just like there shouldn't be a "unbreak my
kernel" config option. There needs to be some sort of reason and
proportion in all this. 
Where to draw the line is tricky I suppose and to a large degree a
matter of taste of the individual developer; but to be realistic; things
like 4-level pagetables or objrmap have a similar or higher risk of
breakage when they got in, and those didn't get config options
(something I agree with fwiw). In fact each 2.6.X release so far has had
2 or 3 major changes more risky/invasive than 4K stacks.
All that people say about 4k/4k stacks vs unified 8k stacks is
smoke-and-daggers to be honest (yes there were some problems in the past
with XFS, XFS got mostly fixed and Neil's patch fixes that for real, but
the basic things got fixed long ago). They forget that 2.4 got along
fine for a long time with a 4k/2k stack, or maybe chose to forget. All
those overflows you mention should hit double on 2.4 (and to be honest,
2.4 does hit some overflows, mostly due to the effective 2k irq side).
The 4k/4k approach is an extension on top of the 2.4 situation. 2.6 with
a unified 8k stack has a bit extra space, sure. but not dramatic much
more either.
