Linux drivers have no problem with interrupt-rates up to about 150,000
per second if the CPU is 130 MHz or faster and the ISR is small.

Normally, a Linux driver implements open/close/read/write/poll/ioctl. It
transfers chunks of data so the large memory allocations are in
user-space while the chunks are small buffers in kernel space.

Linux drivers are quite straight-forward and they can be inserted/removed
from a running kernel (modules). This makes development run very quickly
beause you can make small portions, test them, make more, etc., without
ever having to re-boot. As long as you write code that behaves, i.e., no
buffer overflows, and proper data allocation/deallocation, you will
never have to re-boot.

It's ideal. But, you have to start thinking like a Linux/Unix
programmer. For instance, you do not allocate large buffers inside
the kernel, you use poll() or select() to let user-mode code know
that some event (like an interrupt) occurred so you can get/put
data using read() or write(). You use ioctl() to send/receive
control information to your device.
