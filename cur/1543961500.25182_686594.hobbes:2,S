| Hi Peter,
| 
| yes, we already have X86_VM_MASK defined to 0 in vm86.h on 64bits
| cpu - the only question - why this file was not included in ptrace.h
| even the machine was 32bit cpu configured (according to Ingo's config).
| I've been suspecting that it's __i386__ who is responsible for that but
| I was wrong - it's just alias for CONFIG_X86_32. Interesting... ;)
| Need time to investigate. /And sorry Thomas, I was wrong about your
| commit/

Hmm, Peter, it seems I've failed again - of course we don't have
this flags set to 0 on 64bit cpu :(
