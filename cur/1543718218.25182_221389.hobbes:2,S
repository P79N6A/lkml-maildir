we'd need to take the page_table_lock to do that from there, I find
safer to stay at the pagecache layer at that point inside the nfs
filesystem routines. the semantics of invalidate_inode_pages2 doesn't
require a synchronous invalidate with major fault, both O_DIRECT and nfs
cannot provide distributed shared memory anyways, all it matters is that
_future_ reads will trigger readpage again to provide inode invalidate
semantics.

sounds good then ;)
