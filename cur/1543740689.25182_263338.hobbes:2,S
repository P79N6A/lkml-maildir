Because i don't know very well gstreamer and not a lot of applications are
use it. But i can try to produce a plugin for it, but i don't know a lot of
application (video) that use gstreamer. I can try to make a plugin for
gstreamer, i'll put on my TODO.
I try gstreamer with amarok to play sound using alsa, and this does't work
(segfault). Gstreamer seems too big to be the default for every applications,
think that you can put a webcam on a top appliance, with little memory, space
disk, and NO XML :-)
