I watched the log files of their tests - the only message that went out of
our system was one saying 'relaying denied'. Now the bounce message may
have had enough of their original message to fool their system into
thinking that they had been sucessful in the relay attempt.
I haven't heard from them in many months (May 99) and we've had no
complaints that mail isn't getting through...
