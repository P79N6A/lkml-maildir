It should indeed be a clean fetch, but I wonder if Dmitri perhaps does a 
"git pull" - which will do the fetch, but then try to _merge_ that fetched 
state into whatever the last base Dmitri happened to have.
Dmitry: you cannot just "git pull" on linux-next, because each version of 
linux-next is independent of the next one. What you should do is basically
	# Set this up just once..
	git remote add linux-next git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git
and then after that, you keep on just doing
	git fetch linux-next
	git checkout linux-next/master
which will get you the actual objects and check out the state of that 
remote (and then you'll normally never be on a local branch on that tree, 
git will end up using a so-called "detached head" for this).
IOW, you should never need to do any merges, because Stephen did all those 
in linux-next already.
