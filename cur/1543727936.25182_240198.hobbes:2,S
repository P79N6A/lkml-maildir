Hello,  I'm somewhat new to Linux kernel programming.  I've made a few 
drivers for custom/embedded hardware, etc with kernel 2.4 and kernel 2.6 
w/ devfs, but I'm a little lost working with sysfs and udev.
All I want to do is have udev register my character device for a custom 
PCI board.  Is there a FAQ that explains this?   Does udev need to be 
configured to look for my device?  Currently, I have it registering with 
sysfs as a pci driver and it shows up under /sys/bus/pci/drivers.
Thanks,
-Paul
