OK, I'm really not happy with doing this for three reasons:
1. It's inviting huge amounts of driver churn changing bitfields to
booleans
2. I do find it to be a readability issue.  Like most driver writers,
I'm used to register layouts, and those are simple bitfields, so I don't
tend to think true and false, I think 1 and 0.
3. Having a different, special, type for single bit bitfields (while
still using u<n> for multi bit bitfields) is asking for confusion, and
hence trouble at the driver level.
