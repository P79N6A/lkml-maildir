in nv_request_irq
                if ((ret = pci_enable_msi(np->pci_dev)) == 0) {
                        np->msi_flags |= NV_MSI_ENABLED;
                        if (request_irq(np->pci_dev->irq, handler,
IRQF_SHARED, dev->name, dev) != 0) {
in request_irq
int request_irq(unsigned int irq, irq_handler_t handler,
                unsigned long irqflags, const char *devname, void *dev_id)
...
        action->dev_id = dev_id;
...
        retval = setup_irq(irq, action);
in setup_irq
int setup_irq(unsigned int irq, struct irqaction *new)
....
        new->irq = irq;
it seems I missed that here new is irqaction instead of net_dev.
