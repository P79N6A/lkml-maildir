At this point I seem to have stumbled across a document that has what Joerg 
might be looking for Linux to introduce. It's available at t10.org and is a 
translation layer specification for OS's to use if they want to access ATA 
devices like SCSI ones.
Seems to me this wouldn't be a good or bad thing to add to the kernel. The 
problem is that introducing the layer and thereby unifying the SCSI and ATA 
busses into one namespace is a big task. I know I couldn't manage it, and 
don't think there are any people willing to take it on.
Introducing it would provide a standard interface, however.
