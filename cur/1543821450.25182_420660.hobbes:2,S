For example; you can run _both_ a full sparse with all checks _and_  
"gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -g -O2" in less time than it takes to  
_just_ run "g++ -O0" on a nearly identical file.  If you have some  
new typechecking to do, figure out how to add it to sparse without  
cluttering up the syntax, don't convert the thing to C++, slow down  
the compile, etc.
