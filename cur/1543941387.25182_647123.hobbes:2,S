At least in 2.6.24-rc8 seemed to be OK, for the first time, I encountered the
bug in 2.6.24-git4. 2.6.24-git6 seemed to be OK. 2.6.24-git9 is not.

I use thinkpad acpi module, ACPI_DOCK is always built in.

In 2.6.24-git4, it was 100% reproducible - just pressing undock button on the
dock and the oops has been generated.
In 2.6.24-git9, I do not know, whether it is reproducible or not. And as I'm
ill and my dock is in work, I'm not sure when I be ready to test it again.

do you need just acpidump as is or should I do acpidump when docked?
