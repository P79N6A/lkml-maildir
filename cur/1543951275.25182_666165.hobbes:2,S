yep, that's my experience as well - output constraints are pretty robust 
in general, but if one tries the same effect via the clobber list it's 
easy to run into gcc internal errors. I've applied your patch to 
x86.git. Do you think it's 2.6.25 material? I'm inclined to have it in 
the 2.6.26 bucket. We could do your first, minimal fix in 2.6.25 and do 
this second, full fix in 2.6.26.
