Am running with the 22-rc4-mm2-hrt4 patch on my Latitude D820.  Mostly seems
to work, but for some reason the Intel 'powertop' util thinks it's 100% busy:
     PowerTOP version 1.7       (C) 2007 Intel Corporation
Cn          Avg residency (5s)          P-states (frequencies)
C0 (cpu running)        (100.0%)
C1                0.0ms ( 0.0%)         2.00 Ghz     0.0%
C2                0.0ms ( 0.0%)         1.67 Ghz     0.0%
C3                0.0ms ( 0.0%)         1333 Mhz     0.0%
                                        1000 Mhz   100.0%
In reality:
[/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle] for i in */*; do echo -n "$i: "; cat $i; done
state0/latency: 1
state0/power: 1000
state0/time: 0
state0/usage: 3
state1/latency: 1
state1/power: 500
state1/time: 1756017623
state1/usage: 1837402
state2/latency: 57
state2/power: 100
state2/time: -159524787
state2/usage: 15007443
I think we have a 32/64 bit issue on state2/time which is probably borking
things up....
