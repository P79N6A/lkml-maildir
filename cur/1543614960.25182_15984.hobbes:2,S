What would be the best place to include this into the kernel config
scheme?  Make an option, e.g. 'AMD Elan SC410 support' in "Processor type
and features"?
I'll make an update for my SC410 patchlet on
  
http://www.schwebel.de/software/dnp/index_en.html
during the next days, to add the fix for the serial port bug and the A20
problem.
Do these problems (A20, serial port, timer) only exist on AMD's SC410
chips or are they also present on the SC520s?
