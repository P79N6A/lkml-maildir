I believe some vendors have such devices. Mikulas called them 'disk', but it's 
in fact a (disk(s), controler, ram, battery)
Some controlers are even able to write into flash memory the un-written data 
when/if the battery/power is about to fail. When power goes up, controler can 
finaly do the writes on disks.

Well... even RAM can fail :) In this case isnt linux flawed in design ?
