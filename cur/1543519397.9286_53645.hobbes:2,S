"Somebody" here...
I've never been convinced that I understood what was going on with Tigran's
problem.  I'm particularly bothered by his temp fix, which, afaik, should
have been a nop.

The only odd thing is that length 0 region at the end, which my patch will
stomp all over, but I can't see in current code that it should matter.  Or
did I miss a fencepost?

   Well, I'd put a patch in, but someone else wants to take over the memory
   detection stuff so I'm not sure if our patches would collide with each
   other or not.
