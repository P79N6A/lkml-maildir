I'm pretty sure we're looking at the same bug, at least they are
remarkably similar for a co-incidence. If you have the time, it might be
worth checking if commenting out inc_preempt_count() and
dec_preempt_count() from kmap_atomic() and kunmap_atomic() masks the bug
for you. It's not a workaround but it might help narrow down where things
are going wrong
