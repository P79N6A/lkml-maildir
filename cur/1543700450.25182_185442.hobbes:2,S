It's not that simple: the function does
    kmalloc();
    spin_lock();
    use_allocation.
If the caller does the locking, then the kmalloc would have to use 
GFP_ATOMIC, or the caller would have to do the alloc.
But: as far as I can see, these lines usually run under lock_kernel(). 
If this is true, then the spin_lock(&fasync_lock) won't cause any 
scalability regression, and I'll use that lock instead of lock_sock, 
even for network sockets.
