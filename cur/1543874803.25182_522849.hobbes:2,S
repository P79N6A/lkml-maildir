Mike, if you need my old scheddos, I can resend it to you as well as to
any people working on the scheduler and asking for it. Although trivial,
I'm a bit reluctant to publish it to the whole world because I suspect
that distros based on older kernels are still vulnerable and the fixes
may not be easy. Anyway, it has absolutely no effect on non-interactive
schedulers.
Regards,
Willy
