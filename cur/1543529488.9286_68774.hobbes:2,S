Ok. That makes things much better. I had understood something different
from you in a previous message.

So what happens on a uniprocessor when
             level triggered arrives
             no-ack dispatch of level trigger
             higher priority  level arrives
             dispatch second driver
             ack.
Acks are not vector specific, so does the unacked level irq assert again?
BTW: Is it correct to say that 
             ack after a level causes a operation on both local and io-apic
             ack after an edge is purely local.
If so, what happens with
             level triggered arrives
             no-ack dispatch of level trigger
             higher priority  EDGE arrives
             ack (intended to ack edge) 
Does the local apic do acks in stack order?
Is it now an error to do __sti in interrupt mode?
What happens on 
             level triggered arrives
             no-ack dispatch of level trigger
             timer irq arives
             ack (intended to ack edge) 
             process switch from timer code.

I hope that most drivers comform already, otherwise ....
Consider what might happen on a slow disk drive
            disk_irq:
                       ...
                       note error
                       reset
                       wait for a jiffie to see if it's happier
Suppose we have a slow disk drive and a fast network card.  On machine
A the drive gets the higher priority hardware vector and things fail.
On system B the drive gets the lower priority vector ...
I really dislike hardware interrupt  priorities since they have nothing
to do with the OS' ideas of importance and are complex to work with.
