Yeah, I've been running dyntick on my VIA Epia home server for a while now:
# uname -r
2.6.12-rc4
# uptime
 23:39:46 up 76 days,  9:10,  5 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.00
# pmstats 5
Current: 0mA Voltage: 0.00mV Power: 0.00W 0mAh Time: 00:00h Ticks: 0HZ
Current: 0mA Voltage: 0.00mV Power: 0.00W 0mAh Time: 00:00h Ticks: 33HZ
Current: 0mA Voltage: 0.00mV Power: 0.00W 0mAh Time: 00:00h Ticks: 32HZ
Current: 0mA Voltage: 0.00mV Power: 0.00W 0mAh Time: 00:00h Ticks: 34HZ
Current: 0mA Voltage: 0.00mV Power: 0.00W 0mAh Time: 00:00h Ticks: 35HZ
My server is mostly idle, and the average HZ is around 35HZ.
This is still with the max HZ set to 1000. With dyntick, the max HZ
should be set to something that provides best performance under heavy
load on the system. Or least latency or whatever.
But AFAIK, it does not make any sense to limit the max HZ because of
power savings. That's just a bad compromise.

Tony
