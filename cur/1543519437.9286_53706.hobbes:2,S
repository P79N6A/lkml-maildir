[ this is my first post to this list, please point me to a better
  forum if necessary, thanks ]
I've written a linux device driver for the development board of a
programmable multimedia processor (mediaprocessor) developed by my
company.  I'm looking for the fastest way for software running on our
mediaprocessor to pull data from the linux host (preferably from
user-space).  Does some sort of multimedia streaming data code exist
somewhere already?  Would I benefit from the video4linux work and
should I just port that to use our hardware?
Software running on our mediaprocessor has access to the PCI bus and
can read and write the hosts physical memory.  I currently use a
kernel buffer (from __get_dma_pages) for some basic shared memory
message passing.  I've also written a gdb stub which uses this shared
memory so I can use gdb to debug software running on our
mediaprocessor.
I use another kernel buffer (from __get_dma_pages) in which the
software on the mediaprocessor can write data and a linux user-space
daemon can watch this buffer and parse dump it's contents.  This is
used for printf and basic file IO support for mediaprocessor software.
The shared memory communication works fine for small messages, but for
reading/writing large multimedia files to/from the host it can be
quite slow since large reads/writes need to be broken up into multiple
messages.
Basically, I'm looking for a fast way for software running on our
mediaprocessor to stream in data from the host.  The applications
being audio/video/imaging codecs that are running on the
mediaprocessor would get their input data from the linux host.
Any comments, ideas, pointers would be appreciated.
