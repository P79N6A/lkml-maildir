As I said. Linear reading of files will do few seeks that just were
not there in previous versions. Old ext2 reading such file means 0
seeks, now you need to seek for indirect block (but caching will help
you). I do not know how much degradation in means.

I do not know if I should attempt official kernel integration. I
probably can make it per mount option pretty easily.
