The license says that derivative work has to be GPL. Naturally, every
sensible and practically usable license has gray areas. We know that
and we live with that. But if there's room for interpretation, it's
perfectly OK and helpful, if the copyright holder states what his
interpretation is. If you use an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL symbol in non-GPL
code, you know that the owner of the work doesn't agree with you
license-wise. You had to cheat, e.g. by setting your MODULE_LICENCE to
"GPL", and deliberately acted against the wishes of the copyright
holder. Here in Germany, the GPL is enforceable, and such evidence
will at least weaken your position. You won't get away with just
saying you didn't know the copyright holder's position. Even
printouts of some mails in this thread could be used to prove that
you knew.   
IANAL, there hasn't been such a case AFAIK, and you might well leave
the court unharmed. But can you (or anyone else) be sure? That's what
it's all about.

Yes it does. Chapter 2b requires any part that is derived from a GPL
work to be GPL, too. As you well know.
Just to help you a bit: The only argument you could use is that a
kernel module, even if it uses GPL'ed kernel code, is not a derivative work.
You _might_ succeed with that interpretation, even before a German
court, and even if it can be proven that you knew that the original
author doesn't agree with you. Come on, try it!

Oh, come on! You cannot turn a derived work into an original work just
by distributing them seperately.
Thanks,
Hans
