this is what CFS does:
  static void yield_task_fair(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p)
  {
          struct cfs_rq *cfs_rq = task_cfs_rq(p);
          u64 now = __rq_clock(rq);
          /*
           * Dequeue and enqueue the task to update its
           * position within the tree:
           */
          dequeue_entity(cfs_rq, &p->se, 0, now);
          enqueue_entity(cfs_rq, &p->se, 0, now);
  }
