Yes it does - kqueue() is 'level-triggered' by default.  You may want
to check my latest USENIX paper, which explains this, as well as some
performance measurements, at:
    
http://www.flugsvamp.com/~jlemon/fbsd/kqueue_usenix2001.pdf
The kernel validates the state (or "level") before returning the event
to the user, so the event is guaranteed to be valid at the time the 
syscall returns.
As Christopher pointed out, any event can be converted into an
edge-triggered style notification simply by setting EV_CLEAR.  However,
this is not usually a popular model from a programmer's point of view,
as it increases the complexity of their app.  (This is what I've seen, YMMV)
