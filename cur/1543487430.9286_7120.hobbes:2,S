: So Larry, the interface I would like for people to have is simply
: something like this:
: 
: 	bitccs --extract "Checkin-name" | mail torvalds@transmeta.com
: 
: and the "--extract" function would just create a Alan-like patch that is
: sent to me as a plain textfile (subject, body, context diff and all). 
: 
: I can then do "s../doit" to save it to my "doit" file, and batch them up,
: and then do
: 
: 	bitccs --apply ~/doit
OK, you got it.  We may need to revisit if I get it wrong, but this is 
exactly the feedback I wanted.  I'll try and build you exactly what you 
asked for here.
