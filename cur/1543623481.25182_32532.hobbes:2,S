That's what exactly what I do to increase txqueue length.
         ifconfig $1 txqueuelen 20

Setting txqueuelen to 1 will pretty much kill TCP performance as soon as 
window will grow
to more than 1 segment. Because net layer just drops packet if txqueue is 
full and TCP will
have to re-transmit. Don't trust your gut feeling ;-).
I did some experiments with PPP over HDR links here in Qualcomm. And I had 
to increase
queue just because stuff was dropped even before it reaches serial driver. 
I can even claim
that for todays fast links like PPPoE, PPPoATM, HDR, etc txqueuelen == 3 is 
way to small.
btw You might want to use tcptrace. Watching tcpdump on the fly is no fun. 
tcptrace will
give you nice graphs of what happens and when.

You _will_ drop it, if txqueue is full. TCP will back off and re-transmit
but this will not allow TCP window to grow and you TCP performance will
be pretty bad.
I totally agree with Paul. Just decrease buffering below PPP.
