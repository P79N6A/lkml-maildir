Wrong(tm).
autofs AND mounting at the commandline just say:
mount.nfs: /mnt is already mounted or busy
Which has an actual information value of about 1%.
In my case i moved a nfs exported directory inside another nfs-exported 
directory month ago and placed a symlink where the direcotry was (on the 
server-side). It never acured to me that that was "wrong"(tm).
Now i can only mount one of the two mounts and the other just tells 
"busy".
After reading this i could fix my case easyly. I just erased the 
"deeper" mount and symlinked the directory from the other mount.
But YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG. Just getting a "Busy" 
lets you staying with Question-marks flying around you head!
