After succesfully compiling kernel 2.2.0-pre1 with EtherWorks card
included, in pre2 and pre3 the kernel wont compile with that driver
anymore it gives me the followind error message:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.2.0-pre2/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2
     -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2
-malign-jumps=2
     -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=586 -c -o ewrk3.o ewrk3.c 
     ewrk3.c: In function `EISA_signature': 
     ewrk3.c:1658: fixed or forbidden register was spilled. 
     This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm 
     statements or clauses. 
Ps the driver is for an isa card..
