Right, but we were planning on removing all that code in the interest of 
    stripping relayfs down to its bare minimum as a high-speed data 
transfer mechanism.

Yes, I think that's the one thing everyone's agreed on.

I have to confess I haven't had the time to look at it in detail, but I 
previously suggested that we might be able to recover the read() 
operations by providing them in userspace on top of the mmapped relayfs 
buffer, using FUSE.  If we did that, our FUSE filesystem could also 
provide the namespace, I assume.
Anyway, I don't think I've seen any objections in principal to the 
filesystem part of relayfs, so maybe it's not an issue - any other 
suggestions would be welcome, of course...
