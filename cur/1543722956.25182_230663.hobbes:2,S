I'm not sure why the 8250 code reserves/registers ttyS0 on Altix when
do such hardware exists.  I vaguely recall patching it to prevent this
in a hacky way.
I would like to know why the 8250 code is registering a driver for
hardware that doesn't exist and see that fixed.

You can, I did this.  It was probably a horrible hack, I really can't
recall anymore.  I don't know if that code ever got out or what
happened to it.  Maybe there are some PVs about it somewhere?  I'm
pretty sure the patches got sent out for vendor inclusion.
I would simply find out why the 8250 driver is preventing a
registration for you and go down that path.
The other issue is what if someone puts a serial-port/modem card in an
Altix so you do have 8250/16550-like hardware?  I'm not sure that's
sensible though and they probably deserves to break.
I guess in general you have a bigger problem though, you can have tens
of serial ports on a large system and if you want to support them all
(or have the option of doing so) something more sensible needs to be
figure out.
