Hmmm.. there is a project called shmfs [shared memory filesystem] created
by Eric Biederman.
His latest stable version is 0.1.010. This code hasn't been touched for
about the last six months, he's coding for dosemu AFAIK.
Can be dowloaded at:
http://www.npwt.net/~ebiederm/files/
There is a version, 0.3.001 which contains my code [as I remember it is
upon 0.1.009]. It makes statically kmalloc-et inodes to be also swappable
but I've made some code duplications [there is many code
duplicated unnecessarily in btreei/d.c] and wanted to fix that. There is a
0.3.002 code which merges that code together but I haven't released that
since there is a [possibly] small bug in that I couldn't encounter. I'll
send the patch to anyone upon interest.. [Well finally I should use to
start using ddd but I failed to debug kernel with that :(]
