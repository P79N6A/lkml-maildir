Excuse me hopping in.
I have that situation here, too. Screen frozen, no pings from the
local network, sysrq doesn't work (keyboard dead).
BUT: the other interface (internet) works just fine. When I look
in the logs afterwards, I find everything worked fine except the
following:
maniac kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
maniac kernel: eth1: Tx timed out, lost interrupt? TSR=0x3, ISR=0x3,
t=21.
Basically, the nic for my local lan is gone. And due to the fact, that
the box is unsuable for me (don't have another internet connection to
log in *that* remote), I have to reboot hard. Thank god there's
reiserfs ;-).
All this happened on 2.4.3 and 2.4.4 (don't excactly remember on
earlier 2.4).
I followed your suggestion regarding PCI-slots. Both my nics used to
use PCI 4 and 5 (on a gigabyte vxd7, dual 1GHz). Only the one in slot
4 had the problems. I switched the card to slot 1 and will monitor the
situation. I'll mail the list in case it doesn't change my situation.
Any other hints are welcome (other than the noapic, which didn't help).
