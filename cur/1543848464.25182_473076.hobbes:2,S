Well, other than in calibrate, I use it only in one other place - the mouse 
polling kthread
(mdps_mouse_kthread). In there it's used to calculate the absolute location 
of the "mouse".
At most I will get a value that doesn not correspond to the current 
position.
This means that the mouse pointer will perhaps jump, since the x calibration 
value has
updated and y calibration has not yet.
