    I think the shadow driver can not share inputdev with the related
fundamental driver, so here are two input devices for one hid_device,
how we should process both? It seem we have three choices:
1. Shadow | Fundamental means
    I think this is Jiri said. Fundamental driver handle all common
input events, and Shadow driver handle anther specific input events,
this imply user space process need monitor both input devices at same
time, I do not think this is good idea.
2. Shadow & Fundamental means
    Let Fundamental driver and Shadow driver work at same time! but
shadow also handle specific input event. So, the user may get twice
input events! For example, the keyboard input in console.
Also, I do not like this.
3. Shadow ^ Fundamental means
    Let Shadow driver handle every thing, and fundamental device silent,
even unregister it. I think this is best choice between them, this means
have a bit of complex.
Welcome for your words.
PS: Have we need more than one shadow driver for same fundamental
driver? I do not think so.
Good luck.
