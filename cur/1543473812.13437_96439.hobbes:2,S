Ok. But I hope you wouldn't mind inserting into binfmt_misc something that
does:
#ifndef CONFIG_PROC_FS
#error You really need /proc support for binfmt_misc. Please reconfigure!
#endif
In my opinion, it is always nicer to #error than to let GCC give some 
obscure message, AND it gives some (=my) testing-tools a chance to know that
this is a known illegal configuration. 
BTW: Since this is your opinion, you might want to change the #warning in 
drivers/block/ide.c line 2754 into an #error, for the same reasons. 
About why not having /proc: According to Alan's buglist, there are some
issues meaning that you don't want /proc if you can consider your users
hostile (for example students on a university computer). Dummy-functions for 
config_proc_fs will cure this ofcourse.
