Hello,
I tried to compile the Linux 2.2.0-pre1 with egcs-1.1.1 and
glibc-2.0.7pre6 on my Linux 2.0.36. However, when I "make xconfig", I
got the error I have never seen before:
./tkparse < ../arch/i386/config.in >> kconfig.tk
unknown command=unset CONFIG_PCI_BIOS CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT(39)
Bad if clause at line 44:[ -n "$CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS" -o -n "$CONFIG_PCI_GOANY" ]; then
make[1]: *** [kconfig.tk] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.1.132/scripts'
make: *** [xconfig] Error 2
Could someone here kindly enlighten me how to deal with that? If
possible, pls email me at 
	yan@codonics.com
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks.
