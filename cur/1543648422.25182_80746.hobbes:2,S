Hmmm...this is classic interrupt routing problem type symptoms.  Can you
try booting with noapic or with a up kernel and see what happens?  Also,
try Justin's driver.  Interestingly enough, here mine works with no more
changes than just the one I already sent to you and Justin's doesn't :-/  
Going to start debugging Justin's driver for now until I hear back from 
you.
