 I also can't reproduce it under another box, so I compiled the -rc1
kernel again with same config and I'm trying to crash the produtive
server with that, but seems like I can't.
 I'm confused, maybe this problem was caused by some kind of compile
problem due to memory error, maybe just the ftp workload changed and
it's a hard to hit bug, don't know.. anyway, I use the -rc1 by now and
I'll report if this happened again.. sorry for the early report
