Ok, things are a bit weird with UniNorth, AGP base beeing at 0
is actually correct. You probably need fixed DRM which can deal
with UniNorth weirdies. Ask Michel Dänzer <michel@daenzer.net>

What you see there is what I would like to program in the card, but I
had to disable this for now as it's incompatible with current XFree
