Ok. However, please include a proper diffstat. And by proper, I mean:
	git diff -M --stat --summary
because right now your diffstat doesn't contain the final "total number of 
lines added/removed" (which is the easiest way for me to see that there 
isn't anything strange in there), and your diffstat doesn't do renames, so 
renames look like delete/create pairs. For example, you had:
>  arch/x86/lguest/boot.c                | 1070 ++++++++++++++++++++++
>  drivers/lguest/lguest.c               | 1108 ----------------------
but in reality it was not at all thousands of lines changed, but instead a 
rename with much smaller changes:
 drivers/lguest/lguest.c => arch/x86/lguest/boot.c  |  102 +-
which is a lot more readable and tells me much more about what is going 
on.
And at the end, I really do want to see the details like this:

which again gives a nice overview of what the heck is actually going on 
here. All of which you get for free if you use the above git command line.
Anyway, pulled. But just for future reference,
