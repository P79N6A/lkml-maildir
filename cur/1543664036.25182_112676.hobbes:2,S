I think the difference between SMP and HT is likely to decrease rather
than increase in the future.  Even now people want to put multiple CPUs
on the same piece of silicon.  Once you do that it only makes sense to
start sharning things between them.  If you had a system with 2 CPUs
which shared a common L1 cache is that going to be a HT or an SMP system?
Or you could go further and have 2 CPUs which share an FPU.  There are
all sorts of combinations you could come up with.  I think designers
will experiment and find the one that gives the most throughput for
the least money.
