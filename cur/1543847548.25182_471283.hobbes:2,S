Subject: 2.6.18 suspend regression on Intel Macs

Well, I'm not sure it qualifies as a regression, because AFAIK no
official kernels can s2ram/resume Intel Macs correctly out of the box.
There has already been some discussion about the SCI_EN ACPI control bit
not being set when the Mactel boxes come out of suspend to ram.

The symptom is:
    irq 9: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
    Disabling IRQ #9
when the system comes out of sleep, making ACPI non-functional.
Two days after having released 2.6.17, Linus commited a fix for this
issue in his tree (commit 5603509137940f4cbc577281cee62110d4097b1b):

+ /* Make sure SCI is enabled again (Apple firmware bug?) */
+ acpi_set_register(ACPI_BITREG_SCI_ENABLE, 1, ACPI_MTX_DO_NOT_LOCK);
+
I since then used lightly patched 2.6.17 kernels on my MacMini without a
problem. With the release of 2.6.18, I decided to switch to a vanilla
kernel but I realized that the above issue reappeared. 
I tracked it down to the ACPI merge that took place on July 1st. More
precisely the commit 967440e3be1af06ad4dc7bb18d2e3c16130fe067 (ACPI:
ACPICA 20060623) contains the following hunk:

+		 *

+		 */
+		status = acpi_hw_register_read(ACPI_MTX_DO_NOT_LOCK,
+					       ACPI_REGISTER_PM1_CONTROL,
+					       &read_value);
+		if (ACPI_FAILURE(status)) {

+
 		status =
 		    acpi_hw_low_level_write(16, value,
 					    &acpi_gbl_FADT->xpm1a_cnt_blk);
which makes Linus' fix a no-op, because it disallows setting the SCI_EN
bit.
