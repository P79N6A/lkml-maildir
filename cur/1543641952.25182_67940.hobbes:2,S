And its not just kde. I have several things that won't configure 
because the *&%&^%$ libqt-mt.so in >= qt-3.0.2 can't be found.  
There are 4 copies of 3.0.4 scattered about my system.  Its a real 
problem that so far evertone seems to think will go away if our 
$QTDIR is set correctly, and/or we use the --with-qt-libs= options.
It doesn't go away no matter how much the rest of this list wishes 
*we* would.
