this patch should be moot meanwhile. Earlier versions of the lock 
validator produced false positives for certain read-locking constructs.
i have undone the patch:
  lock-validator-sk_callback_lock-workaround.patch
and there doesnt seem to be any false positives popping up. Please dont 
remove it from -mm yet, i'll test this some more and will do the removal 
in the lock validator queue refactoring, ok?
