Zero-copy delivers.
Some benchmarks from a user-space network implementation:
  Zero-copy      115Mbyte/s      6% CPU
  Single-copy     82Mbyte/s     97% CPU
  - Alteon ACEnic Tigon-2 PCI
  - 400MHz Pentium II (single processor)
  - BX chipset
  - 64Mb main memory
  - 512k L2 cache
I don't very much is actually _done_ with that data though.
enjoy,
