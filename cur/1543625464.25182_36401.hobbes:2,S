You're welcome :)
I'm using it (better trying) to bond two ppp links together (actually
the
uplinks) without provider support by distributing the traffic according
to uplink bandwidth and spoofing source ip of link1 on link2.
I've not tried the bonding module but afaik it can't be used with ppp
links
and has to be supported by the other end so equalize looks like
the only way to do it, especially since i've got only very few high
bandwidth
connections and one link is a lot slower than the other so i can't rely
on
normal multipath routing to distribute traffic correct.
Bye,
Patrick
