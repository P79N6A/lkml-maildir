on fedora this doesn't matter (due to mount-by-label)
the bigger problem I suspect is that the sata modules aren't part of the
initrd!
you can force the issue by adding
alias scsi_hostadapter1 ata_piix
to the /etc/modprobe.conf file, and then recreating the initrd
(see the mkinitrd tool, or just install the kernel rpm)
