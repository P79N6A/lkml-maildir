It is there.

It is not killable, neither 2.4 nor 2.6 one. It is by design I think,
because I *must not* kill it, or else NFS rootfs will fall off
and box will hang.
However, rpciod gets signalled by -KILL as a side effect of killall5 -9
when I shut my system down.
I do not send -KILL to all processes EXCEPT rpciod because:
(a) there is no suitable command to do that from shell and
(b) I don't like special cases
