It doesn't work either :( (sorry for the delay, but i use
X quite a lot and took me a while to reproduce it again in console)
The description is above....a hang that happens randomly in 2.5
from ages; both with and without X; no sysrq or NMI messages....
now i checked that right-alt/shift/ctrl and scrolllock doesn't work...
i suspect this might be a hardware failure; i should run it a while under
2.4 to see if i get a similar behaviour....
