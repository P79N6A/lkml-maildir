This should be a more-or-less complete list of symbols in glibc 2.1 which
have superseded functions from glibc 2.0:
_IO_do_write _IO_fclose _IO_fdopen _IO_file_attach
_IO_file_close_it _IO_file_fopen _IO_file_init
_IO_file_overflow _IO_file_seekoff _IO_file_setbuf
_IO_file_sync _IO_file_underflow _IO_file_write
_IO_file_xsputn _IO_fopen _sys_errlist _sys_nerr
_sys_siglist chown fclose fdopen fopen pthread_attr_init
sys_errlist sys_nerr sys_sigabbrev sys_siglist tmpfile
Note that this includes all the _IO_* functions because the layout of
FILE has changed. This in fact demonstrates the one major problem with
symbol versioning -- suppose we have a glibc-2.1 program which passes
a FILE* to a shared library which was compiled with glibc 2.0...
