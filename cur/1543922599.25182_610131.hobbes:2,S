This argument seems to start from the assumption that any externally
maintained kernel code *can* get into the kernel, which doesn't stand
up to  reality. Once you admit that there is code which, for very good
reasons, won't ever be accepted into the mainline kernel tree, what you
are saying amounts to: "Code that isn't fit to be included in the
mainline kernel isn't fit to exist at all."
I'm not sure I can agree with that.
