Prior to my patch, __constant_memcpy was -already- only used for small,
constant-size copies.
Therefore, my patch applied __builtin_memcpy only to small,
constant-size copies.  The existing kernel custom-memcpy code continued
to perform as expected.
You and Linus both seem to think MMX/SSE/SSE2 is somehow in the
equation, but I do not see that at all.  I left those paths alone.
Clarification/LART requested...

hum, I didn't parse this at all:
Use of __builtin_memcpy implies trusting the compiler :)
Maybe you meant s/without/with/ ?
