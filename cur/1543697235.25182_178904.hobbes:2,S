Here, I've rebooted to various elevators and run each for at least a 
day, and for mm3, I'd have to say that the diffs are tolerable, but 
the smoothest, most responsive is the deadline version. as still 
gives an occasional 20 millisecond stutter, and cfq might be 10 
milliseconds.  Even as is a far cry from the near show stopper 15 to 
20 second hangs of the performance in the later 2.4's.  Great work 
guys!
