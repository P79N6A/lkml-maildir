You are explainint something that is _completely_ unrelated to the

See my example.

See my example. It _does_ inject a userspace controlled value into
the kernel.

It _does_. What if the pointer was a function pointer and the
kernel executed it? Eh? It would continue to execute userspace
controlled code.

Doing it in the kernel and not from unprivileged user processes
would be a good idea for this anyway...

I do _NOT_ complain about the NULL pointer. You simply did not get
my point.
