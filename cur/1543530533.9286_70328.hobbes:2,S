	Well, you could use SA_RESETHAND with sigaction to specify that
behaviour but yes, you'd expect that you would almost always want that.
However I do think that such a signal should be triggered before memory is
TOTALLY exhaused (perhaps if you trigger the allocation of the 5th last
page in existance or something). This way you have enough pages to do your
cleanup at least.
	OK, now the only issue is who is going to write this. I'm kinda
busy this weekend ;)  Shouldn't be too hard though. Anyone?
