Yes, paravirt ops have a well-specified calling convention (register
based).  There was a cleanup that Andi did that caused the problem
because it removed all the "fastcall" annotations since -mregparm=3
is now always on for i386.  Since MCOUNT disables REGPARM the calling
convention changes (caller pushes to stack, callee expects register)
chaos ensues.  I sent a patch to fix that quite some months back, but
it went stale and I neglected to update it.  Would you like me to dig
it up refresh and resend?
thanks,
