Hello Dave,
I've already searched through the 2.6.11+ kernels, it's only used in
drm_bufs.c and drm.h (see previous patches). I can't vouch for any
applications, I probably should look through xorg at least (although a
name change won't effect binaries).

Well not a bug :-) but lets call it a C++ incompatibility .. I'll see
how much work it is to change this everywhere it is used..  I don't
really want to break loads of userspace apps.. not that many drm apps
exist.. and probably very few of them use the virtual pointer...
Dave.
