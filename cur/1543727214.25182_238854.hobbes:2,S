One candidate for the cause of this improvement is the replacement of 
the active/expired array mechanism with a single array.  I believe that 
one of the short comings of the active/expired array mechanism is that 
it can lead to excessive queuing (possibly even starvation) of tasks 
that aren't considered "interactive".
