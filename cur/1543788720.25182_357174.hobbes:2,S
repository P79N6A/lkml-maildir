Your guess is as good as mine. I can easily demonstrate a benefit when using 
it with desktop workloads but a server? It's not expensive to run but I don't 
really know if it's advantageous either. If I had to take a guess, a server 
that had multiple user logins running applications would benefit, but 
database, web servers etc I doubt would benefit.
