Just need to make sure <whomever> aware of this, when you push to Linus.
In most cases, of dire fixes, they should just go into linux-release, 
and then get pulled into linux-2.6.
For a few cases, like this one, the quick fix will hit linux-release and 
linux-2.6 before the better fix, so no big deal.
In a few rare cases, you will need to create a "for-upstream" tree that 
handles the conflict before it get pushed to Linus.
