There are a fair number of NAS vendors who do linux boxes with Samba
and XFS because of the ACL support, Quantum being the one Tridge now
works for by the way. The reason they want it is so they can support
the features NT folks are used to having in their file servers.
Now, we could just let the NT folks use NT servers instead....
Even getting XFS ACLs running in 2.5 requires part of this patch set.
