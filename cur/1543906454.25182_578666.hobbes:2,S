This has been what I considered the only way to accomplish the 'type'
feature without adding another field to the struct, and is just fine,
especially if prefixes are listed some where, or not. I was just
interested in the possibility of adding types.

The locking is internal to our framework and done on a per-type basis.
The start/end example i mentioned could represent an interval. When the
two points are wired up they both have their private data pointing at a
kmalloc'd interval structure internal to our framework, which contains
a lock.

The cookie approach would accomplish the functionality, though it does
complicate the procedure of adding the instrumenation point. If the
start and the end events are not in the same function/file then
the linking of the cookie could be too instrusive.
In all of our cases the cookie would certainly be a void* pointing to
internal data structures. What is the objection to using the marker's
private data to point to the internal structures?
Thanks for helping out. I realize the situations I'm describing are
quite specialized to our particular situation. Many students here use
the framework for learning systems programming, and as such it evolves
often.
