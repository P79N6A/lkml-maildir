that is not a reasonable statement because...
1) you can do all of tcp/ip in userspace just fine
2) you can do the NFS server in userspace
3) ...
4) ...
there are reasons why things that can be done in userspace sometimes
still make sense to do in kernel space, performance could be one of
those reasons, being unreasonably complex in userspace is another.
Identity management to some degree belongs in the kernel, simply because
identity *enforcing* is in the kernel. Some things related to security
need to be in the kernel at least partially just to avoid a LOT of hairy
issues and never ending series of security holes due to the exceptional
complexity you get.
