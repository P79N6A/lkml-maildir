Since you "grow", you'll be using resize2fs (or growfs or mkfs -G for
UFS). resize2fs and the other tools do exactly that: add inodes - and
you could easily have told this either from reading the resize2fs code
or just trying it on a temp file:
  -- create file system
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/foo bs=1k count=50000
  /sbin/mke2fs -F -j /tmp/foo
  -- check no. of inodes
  /sbin/tune2fs -l /tmp/foo | grep -i inode | head -2
  # Inode count:              12544
  # Free inodes:              12533
  -- resize
  /sbin/e2fsck -f /tmp/foo
  dd if=/dev/zero bs=1k count=50000 >>/tmp/foo
  /sbin/resize2fs /tmp/foo
  -- check no. of inodes
  /sbin/tune2fs -l /tmp/foo | grep -i inode
  # Inode count:              23296
  # Free inodes:              23285
Trying the same after mke2fs -b 1024 -i 1024 shows that the inode
density will continue to be respected.
FreeBSD 6.1's growfs(8) increases the number of inodes. This is
documented to work since 4.4.
Solaris 8's mkfs -G also increases the number of inodes and apparently
also works for mounted file systems.
This looks rather like an education issue rather than a technical limit.

Which is untrue at least for Solaris, which allows resizing a life file
system. FreeBSD and Linux require an unmount.

Well, such "silly limitations"... looks like they are mostly hot air
spewn by marketroids that need to justify people spending money on their
new filesystem.
The only problem remains if you grossly overestimate the average file
size and with it underestimate the number of inodes needed. But even
then, I'd be interested to know if that's a real problem for systems
such as ZFS.
