I think you should use a different font.  Otherwise we're soon in a 
position where we can't abbreviate anything that starts with L and keep 
using lower case throughout.  That doesn't seem like a valid tradeoff to me.
There are plenty of fonts which have good visual distinction between l 
and 1 and O and 0.
