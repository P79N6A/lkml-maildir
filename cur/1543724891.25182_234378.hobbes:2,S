You mean kref_put(), right?

As kref_put() uses a atomic_t, how can that transistion happen twice?
What can happen is kref_get() and kref_put() can race if the last
kref_put() happens at the same time that kref_get().  But that is solved
by having the caller guarantee that this can not happen (see my 2004 OLS
paper for more info about this.)

Hm, maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see how it does so, based
on the implmentation of refcount_get() and refcount_put().  Sure, the
*_rcu implementations are a bit different, but if that's the only
difference with this code and kref, why not just add the rcu versions to
the kref code?

At this time, sure.  But you could always change that :)
(and yes, to do so, we can always shrink the size of struct kref if
really needed...)

Ok, sounds like a plan to me.  Having 2 refcount implementations in the
kernel that work alike, yet a bit different, is not acceptable.  Please
rework struct kref to do this.

We've lived without it until now somehow :)
