Oh puh-leeze.  C9x is in final balloting, and it is very likely it
will pass.  gcc has supported a 64-bit type forever; there is no other
compiler that can compile libcX for X < 6 either (the headers are full
of gcc-specific constructs), so you can go around play with libc4 all
you want, but you're still going to need gcc.
This is silly.
