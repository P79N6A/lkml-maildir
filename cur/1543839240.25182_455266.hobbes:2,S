page->mapping->container is the logical way to think about it, but it is
quite easy to get from a mapping, using the VMA list, to the mms mapping
a page.  It wouldn't be a horrible stretch to get back to the tasks (or
directly to the container) from that mm.
Has anyone ever thought of keeping a list of tasks using an mm as a list
hanging off an mm?
