Is mplayer suid root? (allow SCHED_FIFO/RR usage)
To get the equivalent function you need artswrapper to be suid root,
and "Run soundserver with realtime priority" feature enabled in aRTs config.
[Dangerous with multiuser setups - user can add a plug in that loops forever 
with higher priority than all other processes -> dead system.
The SCHED_SOFTRR patch would be a very welcome addition.
a) No need for suid root, artswrapper tries to use SCHED_FIFO
   Davide - SCHED_FIFO should also be handled as a SCHED_SOFTRR request!
   Not only SCHED_RR (SCHED_FIFO is more frequently used!)
b) Automatic prevention of overuse 
]
If this is not the case - my mplayer is not suid root.
aRTs adds some overhead to allow mixing audio from several applications.
(even if this is not necessary on some audio boards like SB Live!)
To get the same kind of overhead you should run mplayer with output through 
arts...
artsdsp mplayer ...
The final thing to check is KDE Audio Buffer Size (if this is small then it 
won't matter if mplayer uses a big buffer...)
