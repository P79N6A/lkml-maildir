Of the seven drivers I added this parm to, six do not offer such a method
via ioctl:
eurotechwdt.c provides WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT.
acquirewdt.c, advantechwdt.c, ib700wdt.c, pcwd.c, wdt.c, wdt_pci.c do not
provide a set timeout ioctl.
These already offer a timeout parm, but no set timeout ioctl:
i810-tco.c, softdog.c, wdt285.o
The other drivers I didn't add timeout parm to anyhow, but they don't have a
set timeout ioctl either:
machzwd.c, mixcomwd.c, shwdt.c, wdt977.c
Unless there are strong objections or a push to make it an ioctl everywhere
instead/also, I'd like to leave it in.
> Rest looks good
Thanks for reviewing and approving.  14 drivers modified, 5 drivers
approved, one investigating, two email addresses invalid, leaving 6 to hear
from.
