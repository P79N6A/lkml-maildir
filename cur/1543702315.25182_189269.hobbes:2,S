Hi Ben,

Don't you mean "after" instead of "before" here ? Because the case where
it doesn't work is when everything is set up while the cable is unplugged,
but conversely, if the system goes up with the cable plugged, setting the
interface UP detects the link as UP and works. I believe that the problem
is related to setting the interface UP with nothing plugged into it.
Cheers,
Willy
