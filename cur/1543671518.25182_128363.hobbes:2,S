Hi all,
I couldn't find any Linux support for these WLAN chips with google or on this lists archives. So I would like to ask it here:
Is there somebody working on a Linux driver for the Broadcom BCM4306/BCM2050 chips? They are used for instance in the built-in Dell TrueMobile 1300 Wireless LAN PCI card that is sold for Dell notebooks. I've ordered a Dell Inspiron 8500 with such thing in it. (had to choose Dell and the i8500 was the best choice at the moment).
I read on <
http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/G.Wilford/Inspiron8500>that
 the Ethernet chip (BCM4401) is support by a Broadcom driver and a brand new one from Daved S. Miller. So I'm wondering if Broadcom is willing to release specs for the WLAN chips too.
How are the experiences in contacting Broadcom and Dell with requests for help?
Regards,
Bas.
