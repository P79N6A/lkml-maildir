Which only supports my claim more that away from the core kernel issues
near the terminals of the call/lock graph. No working RTOS app is going
to be running on arbitrary hardware. Auditing of path and reworking them
is relatively easy as you must have noticed during the development of
this patch 6 months ago with the removal of semaphore abuses.

This is a new patch that's not in the mainline and putting additional

For protecting data in SMP systems, yes. This is obivous and you know
this from the SMP conversion of Linux about 6+ years ago. Bad drivers
can be a pain, but it's really an incremental process at this time and
hasn't been bad to convert high latency points into piecewise sections.
I understand what you're referrng to but you have to understand that
the changes make the core kernel preemptive, which make this kind of
track where you deal with drivers on a case by case practical. Previous
to that, it was impossible because of the size of the kernel. The
current problems you mention is basically slop that should be reworked
to no hold that mask for extended periods of time.

preempt RT will be deterministic as this patch gets pounded more and
remaining latency paths are reworked. It hasn't been hard so far and the
results have been near perfect since the core kernel is, for the most
part, fully preemptive.
There are problem areas, but that's an excersize left for the readers
(of the patch) to discover and is not mentioned in this text. :)
