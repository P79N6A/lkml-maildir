Yes, me :(
They seem to be totally random (no mozilla, here): I use KDE
and they may occur while scrolling down a window, or while
typing in a shell session or whatever.
I couldn't find a way to reproduce it so far.
Note that they did not happen up to kernel 2.5.75, and they
show up with 2.6.0-t1 and 2.6.0-t1-mm1.
No clues in syslog or kern.log, simply a sudden hard freeze,
without particular HD or CPU activity before.
Bye!
