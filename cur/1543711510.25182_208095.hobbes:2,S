'nmi_watchdog-local-apic-fix.patch' looks Ok, although I
would prefer if it didn't put a 'static' on nmi_perfctr_msr:
the perfctr driver needs access to it.
I'm not happy with 'nmi-1-hz.patch'. The real problem is that
SMP with nmi_watchdog=2 initialises the lapic NMI watchdog but
doesn't check it and therefore doesn't reduce nmi_hz.
This is an SMP bug, but instead of fixing it the patch removes
the check from UP and changes nmi.c to compensate.
This would be Ok if check_nmi_watchdog() with nmi_watchdog=2
was redundant, but I don't believe it is. It has exposed bugs
and unexpected hardware changes before, and so should remain.
I propose the patch below instead. It changes smpboot.c to do a
check_nmi_watchdog() at the appropriate place, which fixes the
high NMI frequency problem w/o changing anything else.
I've verified that it solves the problem on my MP-capable UP box.
