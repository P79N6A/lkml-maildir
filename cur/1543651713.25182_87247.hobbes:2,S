Looks like it.  It's such a hack, I want to hide ;)
Sigh.  I think I'd prefer to just go and make ->page_lock
and ->private_lock irq-safe.
Or not proceed with this patch at all.  If this is to be the
only code which wishes to perform page list motion at interrupt
time, perhaps it's not justifiable?
I really don't have a feeling for how valuable this is, nor
do I know whether there will be other code which wants to
perform page list manipulation at interrupt time.
In fact I also don't know where the whole AIO thing sits at
present.  Is it all done and finished?  Is there more to come,
and if so, what??
