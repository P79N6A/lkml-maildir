Hi,
I looked at Manfred's patch and took what was immediately appropriate for
the latest ABI patch. I did not include the lock/unlock_kernel in the
abi_dispatch entry point because it is not obvious it is needed for 2.3.x
(and in fact Manfred confirms that it is not).
When 2.3.48-preX stabilizes a tiny bit (at the moment it won't even
compile because of list*.h stuff) I will test the patch and update if
necessary. Maybe this evening. For now feel free to download the latest
copy from:

Thanks,
