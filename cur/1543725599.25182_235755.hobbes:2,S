If you search for a leak then you'd have to check the first number in 
each row: the number of active objects. Just look at the first row: it 
documents the fields in the following rows.
If a number is huge and constantly increasing, then there is would be a 
leak. Typically the inode, dentry and buffer_head caches are large, the 
rest are small.
But: slab manages only small objects. I assume that nvidia allocates 
pages with alloc_pages() and then plays with the page flags. This is the 
layer below slab, you must look at /proc/meminfo to detect leaks.
