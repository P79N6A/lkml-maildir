Subject: Bug with PCI initialization in pre2 on a dual P100
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have a dual Pentium 100 machine which uses (I recently found out) a Fugutech
motherboard.  Apparently this is not the best of boards.  It uses Award BIOS
v4.50G.
I used to use the < 2.3.20 kernels without incident until the HD died.  After
being down a while, the machine is back with a Promise UDMA/66 card
(PDC20262) and a new HD.  Unfortunately, now the 2.3.xx kernels no longer
work.  During boot I get:
PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.00 entry at 0xfb690
PCI: Using configuration type 2
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 1 of device 00:03.0
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 3 of device 00:03.0
PCI: Failed to allocate resource 1 for Promise Technology, Inc. 20262
PCI: Failed to allocate resource 3 for Promise Technology, Inc. 20262
and a little later:
PDC20262: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 18
PDC20262: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PDC20262: (U)DMA Burst Bit ENABLED Primary PCI Mode Secondary PCI Mode
PDC20262: IO baseregs (BIOS) are reported as MEM, report to <andre@suse.com>
PDC20262: inconsistent baseregs (BIOS) for port 0, skipping
PDC20262: IO baseregs (BIOS) are reported as MEM, report to <andre@suse.com>
PDC20262: inconsistent baseregs (BIOS) for port 1, skipping
PDC20262: neither IDE port enabled (BIOS)
And then it can't mount root so it hangs (I copied the above by hand).  I
don't believe this is a problem with the Promise card.  If I use kernel 2.2.14
w/IDE patches I get:
PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.00 entry at 0xfb690
PCI: Using configuration type 2
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
PCI: Assigning I/O space 5800-5803 to device 00:18
PCI: Assigning I/O space 5804-5807 to device 00:18
and a little later:
PDC20262: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 18
PDC20262: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PDC20262: (U)DMA Burst Bit ENABLED Primary PCI Mode Secondary PCI Mode
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0x6200-0x6207, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:DMA
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0x6208-0x620f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
What further information can I provide to help resolve this problem?
