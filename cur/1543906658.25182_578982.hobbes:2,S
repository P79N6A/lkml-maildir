Although I have no proof immediately at hand, I suspect at a minimum HID 
power class devices should be blacklisted from autosuspend. Given the 
spotty USB implementations on many such devices I'd be surprised if 
suspend worked reliably. Plus if you're connected to such a device for 
monitoring purposes you're probably powered by it as well, so you have 
little to gain from suspend even if it works.
