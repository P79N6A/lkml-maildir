In case anyone cares, this is a snippet of my work-in-progress
read_write.c illustrating how I might handle f_pos.  Can anyone point
me to data showing whether it's worth avoiding the spinlock when the
"struct file" is not shared between threads?  (In my world,
correctness comes before code-bumming as long as the algorithm scales
properly, and there are a fair number of corner cases to think through
-- although one might be able to piggy-back on the logic in
fget_light.)
Cheers,

/*
 *  Synchronization of f_pos is not for the purpose of serializing writes
 *  to the same file descriptor from multiple threads.  It is solely to
 *  protect against corruption of the f_pos field leading to a severe
 *  violation of its semantics, such as:
 *      - a user-visible negative value on a file type which POSIX forbids
 *        ever to have a negative offset; or
 *      - an unexpected jump from (say) (2^32 - small) to (2^33 - small),
 *        due to an interrupt between the two 32-bit write instructions
 *        needed to write out an loff_t on some architectures, leading to
 *        a delayed overwrite of half of the f_pos value written by another
 *        thread.  (Applicable to SMP and CONFIG_PREEMPT kernels.)
 *
 *  Three tiers of protection on f_pos may be needed in order to trade off
 *  between performance and least surprise:
 *
 *    1. All f_pos accesses must go through accessors that protect against
 *       problems with atomic 64-bit writes on some platforms.  These
 *       accessors are only atomic with respect to one another.
 *
 *    2. Those few accesses that cannot handle transient negative values of
 *       f_pos must be protected from a race in some llseek implementations
 *       (including generic_file_llseek).  Correct application code should
 *       never encounter this race, and the syscall use cases that are
 *       vulnerable to it are relatively infrequent.  This is a job for an
 *       rwlock, although the sense is inverted (readers need exclusive
 *       access to a "stalled pipeline", while writers only need to be able
 *       to fix things up after the fact in the event of an exception).
 *
 *    3. Applications that cannot handle transient overshoot on f_pos, under
 *       conditions where several threads are writing to the same open file
 *       concurrently and one of them experiences a short write, can be
 *       protected from themselves by an rwsem around vfs_write(v) calls.
 *       (The same applies to multi-threaded reads, mutatis mutandis.)
 *       When CONFIG_WOMBAT (waste of memory, brain, and time -- thanks,
 *       Bodo!) is enabled, this per-struct-file rwsem is taken as necessary.
