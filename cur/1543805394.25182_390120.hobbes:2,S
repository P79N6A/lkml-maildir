In -mm* we could just apply Eric's patch and then someone should just
grep the tree for NR_CPUS and audit all users - that should
catch basically all occurrences. I can put it onto my todo list,
but I don't know when I'll get to it so it would be nice if someone
else could do this.
For 2.6.16 I think it's best to go forward with my hack.

Eric did that already.
