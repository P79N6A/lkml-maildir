Hi !
First thanks a lot for the good ideas and comments on my previous posting. I 
updated the kernel to 2.4.19-pre4 and it seem's to improve the situation. 
There  was no crash with the RTL Network Card but the system response boged 
down sometimes for a few (up to 10) seconds. Then I tried the same togeter 
with the "3com 3c905C" networkcard and the system hung a few seconds after 
starting the copy-commands "dd count=16M if=/dev/zero of=/home/test0&" and
 "cp /home/zero /dev/null&" and "ico" on an remote terminal for network load. 
Thus my personal work arround would be to use the rtl network card - but 
there remains this problem.
Kai
