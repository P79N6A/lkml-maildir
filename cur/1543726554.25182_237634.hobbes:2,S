Right now it happens in a different way. The patch I've published earlier uses
notifier objects (linux/notifier.h) so that if framebuffer can't find the
matched lcd device, it registers to be notified when new lcd devices appear in
the system; when it does it proceeds like usual (e.g. calls lcd_device_find).
Until it finds the LCD device framebuffer device cannot even initialize
(without powering on the LCD controller in some circumstances it's impossible
to do anything useful).

These lists are anyway maintained by the class.c core. You just need a pointer
to the 'struct class' variable for classes you are interested in, and locking
also comes for free - everything is already implemented. Look in class.c for
list_for_each_entry macros - they all are traveling along these lists.
I personally don't like to make this device matching too generalized - if we
need it for b/l, that's fine, we'll have to implement it for b/l.
But it doesn't look too sane, so I'd rather leave it l/b specific.
