OK, now it's another day and the morning coffee has kicked in and 
everything always look better after some gentle reflection. :)

I'll ask my ppc guy if the changes make a difference.

Hmmm, maybe, maybe not, we have a separate mailing list and web site for 
all the token ring related stuff where everything gets posted, discussed 
and put up for general ridicule. My concern with posting stuff directly to
the kernel list is that changes may get applied to the driver and then
the driver maintainer either has to work with the patches or try to get
them reversed/changed making more work for the maintainer and for Alan/
Linus. 
Either way Arnaldo has sent me some more code to fix up the other stuff in
the driver, most of this looks correct but I also want to fix all the module
stuff as well, the horribleness in there goes back to the days when 
init_trdev did not work sufficiently for the drivers and the dev->priv
did not get aligned on a wide enough boundary.
So, I'll take the patch, make some more alterations, get my ppc guy to 
test the change and then put the patch to be applied.
Mike
