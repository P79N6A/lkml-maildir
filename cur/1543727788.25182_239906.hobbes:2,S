Sure, blame the admins. This is like leaving landmines
in your front yard, then blaming people who step on them.

This isn't, or at least shouldn't, be basic UNIX security.
PAM should call revoke(), except that Linux still doesn't
have this system call. It's been in BSD since 4.3BSD-Reno.
Calling revoke() would fully solve the PAM problems. Any
open file descriptors would be useless. Any hard links to
the device file would get the new permission bits via the
shared inode.
IMHO, hard links need to be severely restricted by default.
It's a waste to make this even a boot option, since almost
nobody would have a legitimate need for the current behavior.
Perhaps there are other ways to deal with the problem though.

You don't have to document problems if you fix them.
