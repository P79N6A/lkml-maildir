I guess it might be useful to express what the original purpose of EDAC
we (Thayne, Eric, etc) were working toward. Arjan you express it
correctly.
We aimed to develop a central place to report all (or almost all)
hardware errors: starting with ECC errors, then added PCI parity errors.
And to do this in a consistent manner so that harvesting and reaping
that error info can become easier and more useful. (EDAC has a common
printk format as well).
Currently the ownership of that feature is the edac_mc module. It is the
one which creates the /sys/devices/system/edac directory and in turn the
'mc' and 'pci' directories.
When we move the PCI Parity checking code to the PCI subsystem it would
be good to maintain that directory layout. 
One way to do that is to make the edac_mc CORE a part of the kernel and
no longer a module. (This would also help on the kobject reference
counter issue).  Then the PCI Parity subsystem code would register
itself after the EDAC CORE code.
