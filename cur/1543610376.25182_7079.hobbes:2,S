To begin, I'm running 2.2.17 with some patches.
I'm attempting to have a userspace app read and write I/O ports on a powerpc
machine.  The obvious method (iopl()) doesn't seem to be available (using glibc,
but sys/io.h doesn't exist).
When I try and access /dev/port with a small utility that works fine on my PIII,
I get the error message "Device not configured".  The file exists in /dev and
has the same permissions on both machines.
Do I need to enable something in the kernel to support this?  Where is this
configured?
Thanks,
Chris
