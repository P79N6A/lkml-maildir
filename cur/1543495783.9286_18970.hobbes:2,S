A curious piece of FUD --- 99.9% uptime for NT?  When a news story
is so littered with misrepresentations about what I know (2GB mem limit
in Linux?) it really makes me suspect the rest.
Was it only a year ago that Gates mentioned Linux in passing as posing
no threat?
What this new official public proclamation shows is how MS is stepping
up their attack; we all now have a responsibility to avoid a stupid
flame war.  MS has the advantage of having no faces, only the
boy-Gates grin icon, so whatever they say does not reflect on a real
person.  In contrast, what any of us might say will have a personality
attached, a real person who will be thought to be responsible. Notice
'they' talk about faceless Mindcraft, ZD &c, their article is not even
signed, yet even for RedHat they specifically mention Bob --- it's
subtle, but effective propaganda)
I'd like to offer a caution. In Swahili, there are two words for
propaganda.  "Propaganda" means "What is bad about our opponent" and
is meant to foster hate and FUD (you see this on the war news
nightly); historically, this works very well to drum up instant
emotional rage, but it fades with time and, like a junkie, must keep
looking for new villians to feed its habit.  The other word is
"Qahare" (kwah-har'-ay) and means "What is great about us" and IMHO it
is a safer yet more powerful media weapon.
