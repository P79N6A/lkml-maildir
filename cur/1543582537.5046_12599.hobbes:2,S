Hi!
I have written the radio-terratec driver some time ago.
I am searching for someone who has send me an email about him being able to 
get the RDS part of the terratec card to work.
Unfortunately I have lost the mail and his address.
If you are reading this, please contact me.
Allthough I am reading the ml archive please CC: to me.
Thanks,
Rolf
