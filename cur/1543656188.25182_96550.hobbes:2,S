This merge looks fishy.  It seems to be yet another let's throw my CVS
repo in merge and backs out Al's work yo get rid of lots of devfs crap.
It also contains strange changes like:
-	ch = kmalloc(sizeof *ch, SLAB_KERNEL);
+	ch = kmalloc(sizeof *ch, in_interrupt() ? SLAB_ATOMIC : SLAB_KERNEL);
that really want proper fixing.
