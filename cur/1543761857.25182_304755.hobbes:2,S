Heh, the sound people went through the same grumblings a few months ago

devfs _can_ do that, as it waits on the register block device to create
the node.  All udev can do is act apon the call to hotplug as fast as it
can (in the correct order).  The kernel issues the call and then
returns, causing modprobe to return.
The distros that use udev have already all worked out these issues with
their init scripts and such, so it shouldn't be an issue anymore.
Jon, what distro are you using?
