I've suggested that you look through the existing three drivers.
There is no how-to written yet, and I don't have time to write one
in the next couple of days before I'm on vacation.
Neither can I teach you how to add partition support to your driver
in these two days.  Again, there's plenty of examples in the kernel,
even in the MMC layer if you really want to re-implement it.
Please try reading some of the already merged code and try to
understand it, as I have already suggested.  Alternatively, please
wait until September.
