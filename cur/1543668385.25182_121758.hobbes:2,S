Once the kernel has booted, it usually passed control to init.  The
kernel usually looks for init in /sbin /etc and /bin, but if there is
no init in those locations, /bin/sh is looked for as a last resort.
I am assuming that you have an init on your system, but something is
wrong.  Using init=/bin/sh will allow you to use the shell as the init
process, which proves it's an init problem.

I don't really understand what you're trying to do.

No.
