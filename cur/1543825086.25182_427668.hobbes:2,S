Well, suspend/resume is normally called during system suspend/resume,
so it has 'interesting' locking requirements.

Result: system hang if userspace tries to do request at the same time
-- PCI drivers probably were not designed for _that_... but we
probably want to fix them, anyway, so this is probably ok (but expect
to do some driver debugging).
But you should really add that preempt_disable and not try this on smp
system...
