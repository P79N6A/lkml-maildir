And can you name a _single_ advantage of doing so?
It so happens, that most people wouldn't notice or care that kmirrord got 
frozen (kernel thread picked at random - it might be one of the threads 
that has gotten special-cased to not do that), but I have yet to hear a 
single coherent explanation for why it's actually a good idea in the first 
place.
And it has added totally idiotic code to every single kernel thread main 
loop. For _no_ reason, except that the concept was broken, and needed more 
breakage to just make it work.
