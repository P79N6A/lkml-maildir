Consider putting Linux on a portable phone. It could contain 13-bit
bytes. Does that mean we should support 13-bit bytes in linux?
No.
People are running Linux on cellphones today, and they are running for
weeks in standby, too. And runtime suspend support is still terminally
broken, so they somehow get around that.
Do you have example of device that has multiple "sleep states" and it
makes sense to use them?
There are examples of devices that have multiple "on states". IIRC
graphics cards can already control their clock tick rates. I hope we
are not trying to solve that one here.
