Sure, but...
Allocating a single order-3 (say) page _is_ a form of batching
We don't want compound pages here: just higher-order ones
Higher-order allocations bypass the per-cpu lists

hm, hadn't thought about that - would need to peek at contiguous pages in
the pagecache and see if we can gang-free them as higher-order pages.
The place to do that is perhaps inside the per-cpu magazines: it's more
general.  Dunno if it would net advantageous though.
