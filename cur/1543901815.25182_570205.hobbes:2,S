Ok, so perhaps a patch to do just that bit could go towards mainline
(possibly after a short stay in -mm).

Hmm, I guess it would make sense to stick it in -mm for an extended
period of time, but hold off on mainline until we start hearing
positive noises that people can no longer break 4K stacks...

;-)
How about if I split it into two tiny patches
 - one that just makes it no longer a debug option and moves the
option out of the "kernel hacking" submenu and into "general setup"
instead, but leave it to default to N.
 - and then one that makes it default Y.
and then submit those two patches to Andrew for inclusion in -mm with
a clear note that only the first one should go upstream anytime soon
and the second one should be kept "strictly -mm" until we arrive at
the point in time where people can no longer break 4K.
How does that sound?
From my point of view that would accomplish my objective of getting 4K
stacks some more testing and the indication that long-term that's the
way we probably want to move.
