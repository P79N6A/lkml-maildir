Same problem here. Intel Core 2 Duo with 2.6.19-rc1 x86_64 SMP. Happens on 
2.6.17 too. I use 'noapic' as a workaround but that disables one of the CPU 
core of course.
I cannot reproduce the problem within the console nor gdm. Only on the X 
desktop.
dmesg and dmidecode outputs are available at:

This is a Dell Inspiron 9400.
