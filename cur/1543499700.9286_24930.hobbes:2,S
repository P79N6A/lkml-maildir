Create them dynamically when either (1) the socket is bound, or (2) some
program (e.g. touch) requests to create them.  If created on binding, set
an "ephemeral" bit somewhere.  Any metadata operation (chown, chmod, etc.)
clears the "ephemeral" bit.  When the socket is unbound, delete the file
if the "ephemeral" bit is set.
