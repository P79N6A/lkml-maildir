I was just wondering if the issues with swap on a raid device and with using a
journaling fs on a raid device had been fixed in the latest 2.4.0-test
kernels?
I've gone too soft over the last few years to read the raid code myself :-)
Thanks in advance,
Craig
PS I might be able to make sense of the code, but my wife would kill me if I
spent any more time on the computer.
