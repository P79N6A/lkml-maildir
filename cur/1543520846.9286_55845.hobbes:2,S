A good point.  I'll also agree with the "smaller margin" as well.
Someone else pointed out that commercial companies have target
dates too, but that they are not publically visible.  In Linux
land, our target dates are public by nature...
I guess that argument is a very good one...  Ok, I'll shut up
now.  Take care, and keep up the good work of narrowing those
margins.  ;o)
