I'm not sure if fundamental security semantics should be optional, but
it is certainly better than before.

Well, merging the patches is not that hard.
tytso actually shown a clever way: add per-filesystem 'default

automatically back-compatible.
(And it would get tou semantics you wanted in inheritance area,
