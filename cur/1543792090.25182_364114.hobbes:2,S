Though there are reasons beyond this, ultimately an initrd is useful primarily 
to distributors, who provide too many drivers to build them all in (the 
resulting kernel image would be too large to boot).
In particular, filesystem, RAID and SCSI drivers (required for rootfs to exist 
before calling onto init), are put into such an image.
