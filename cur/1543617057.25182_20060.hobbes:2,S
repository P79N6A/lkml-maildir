And if the reason you are building a new kernel is that the old one is
mis-identifying some of your hardware? ;)
Could you maybe describe the problem you are trying to solve a bit more
clearly than "the hardware-discovery problem for ISA devices"?  If you
are trying to discover the ISA devices, but rely upon them having
already been discovered, what are you accomplishing?
Puzzled,
