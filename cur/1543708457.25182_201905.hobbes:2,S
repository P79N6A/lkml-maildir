On checking the code and thinking about this, I would suggest that we change 
start_time in the task struct to be the wall time (or monotonic time if that 
seems better).  I only find two places this is used, in proc and in the 
accounting code.  Both of these could easily be changed.  Of course, even 
leaving it as it is, they could be changed to report more correct values by 
using the correct conversions to translate the system HZ to USER_HZ.
Hm, OK, I will work up a patch to do the ladder, i.e. to correctly convert the 
elapsed jiffies to USER_HZ and (for the accounting code) seconds.
