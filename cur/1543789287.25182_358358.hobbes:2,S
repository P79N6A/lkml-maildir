My opinion is that we don't need a barrier even _after_ ll/sc sequences
on Alpha - it's redundant; perhaps it's just a historical baggage.
I strongly believe that ll/sc _does_ imply an SMP memory barrier, as can
be seen from instructions timing: a standalone mb takes tens of cycles,
the mb before/after ll/sc takes 0 to 1 cycle on ev6 (a bit more on ev56)
depending on instruction slotting.
Note that superfluous mb's around atomic stuff still can hurt -
Alpha mb instruction also flushes IO write buffers, so it can
be _extremely_ expensive under heavy IO...
