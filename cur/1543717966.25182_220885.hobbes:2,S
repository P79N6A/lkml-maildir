OK, will do.  I ran the bk exerciser script for over an hour with 2.6.6-current
and no CONFIG_PREEMPT and no errors.  The script only reported one
iteration finished, while I got it to do 36 iterations over several hours earlier
today (with a 2.6.3-4mdk vendor kernel), so I'm going to add some timing 
tests to the script to see if things are really slowing down with current kernels,
or if it's just my worried imaginings.
Going back through my sent mail, it looks like I first reported the originally
noticed failture as a bk bug to LM on 4/15/04 if that helps with kernel versions.
I usually do a bk pull and kernel build every night or so "just for fun".
