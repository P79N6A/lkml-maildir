Well, this is the most bastardized sucker I've ever seen. . . I have had
no end of trouble with it (couldn't even get a boot loader to work with
it - had to write my own).  And, as luck would have it, the serial port
is no different.  Using setserial, I changed the type of this port to a
16550A and all my problems went away.  The question now remains:  How
can I FORCE the Linux serial driver to see this as a 16550A -- As I
before stated, I know that this has a 16-byte buffer.  Therefore, the
16750 with its mammoth buffer size is killing this serial port.  Short
of modifying the kernel (which I'd rather not do) or including the
setserial with the kernel image (also I'd rather not do as I only have
2.3 MB of storage on this device) I need a command line parameter to
control the serial line -- is there one?  A build option?  PLEASE
SOMETHING???
