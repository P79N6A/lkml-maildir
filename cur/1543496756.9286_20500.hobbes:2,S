Hi!
This is next try with capabilities; this is version 9 (wow!), this
time against 2.3.3. It includes updated documentation. Please notice
that it is possible to add elf note to existing executable (software
for doing it is present at
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/elfcap.html
), and enhancing
security of your system could be as easy as running one script.
Please roll in,
							Pavel

+Elf capabilities hack
+
+   From now on, there's support for capabilities in elf executable. Elf
+   executable now may contain "capabilities header", telling which
+   capabilities should be dropped on exec. This can not hurt: lowering
+   capabilities is not priviledged operation, and executable could do it
+   itself at beggining of main.
+   
+   Doing it in exec() time has certain advantages, through: you can
+   easily look and what capabilities are in use by what program and you
+   can set capabilities for existing executables without need to
+   recompile. (It is hard to create tool which insers elfcap header into
+   elf file. But it has been done. Inserting code to drop capabilities on
+   the beggining of main would be nightmare.)
+   
+   Notice that this system is very nice, but as described has limited
+   use. It only lowers capabilities, and raising capabilities is what
+   causes problems. (50% of security holes in unix are related to setuid0
+   programs). But wait: elfcap can easily be used to limit damage done by
+   setuid0 programs. It needs only little trick: ability to set euid back
+   to ruid. By setuid0, process gets all capabilities, and elfcap is free
+   to drop that capabilities it does not want.
+   
+   So, along with existing setuid mechanism, this hack can be used to
+   grant subset of capabilities to executables. For example currently
+   ping has to be setuid0. With elfcap, ping still will be setuid0, but
+   most of its capabilities (and its euid) will be dropped at exec()
+   time, so breaking into ping will allow attacker to generate arbitrary
+   packets to network, but nothing more.
+   
+   Summary of what can elfcap do:
+     * mask inheritable, permitted and effective sets by arbitrary mask
+     * set euid back to ruid (effectivelly undoing result of setuid bit)
+     * set euid to arbitrary value if euid==0 (don't tell anyone, that's
+       really dirty piece of patch and may be dropped)
+       
+   For more info & utility programs, look at
+   
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/elfcap.html.
+   
+Bad idea
+
+   I should empatize that it is bad idea to give suid0 to any program
+   just because you have capabilities. If program did not have suid0
+   yesterday, it probably should not have suid0 today. (Think about
+   booting old kernel, for example).
+
