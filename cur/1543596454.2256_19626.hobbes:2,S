I thought everybody uses metadata-only to avoid killing data-write
performance. So I thought it was ok to at first support O_DIRECT only
for metadata journaling, doing that should be a three liner as you said
and that is what I expected.

brw_kiovec is called by generic_direct_IO, so yes, all you need is a
private generic_direct_IO implementation to deal with the journaled data
writes.

OK, thanks!
