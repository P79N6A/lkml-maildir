The only problem I see is making an app sift through all of the events
to get to a specific type of event. They'd have to parse and match the
signal, that could be costly. 
Will there be small single purpose applications listening on the netlink
socket or off dbus for specific signals? Or do you see this mainly
handled by a single kevent daemon?

I thought you wanted to standardize the signals? Would you have a
delimiter in your signal to have a standard prefix to use to identify
the string in User Space? 
Why not add the attribute name to the path you get from the kobj? 
send_attribute_kevent(kobj, attr->name, signal);
and
send_kevent(kobj, signal);
Thanks,
