I booted into single mode, then umounted all unneeded stuff and put / to ro,
stopped all unused raids, ... then did...

> The machine *should* poweroff.
Nope, it didn't and what was curious was that I was left at the bash prompt
:-?
> If not, then do the whole thing again with this command:

>    strace /bin/halt -f -p
I tried this and I did the strace with a -o to get the output on a remote
cifs fs, here is the full trace:

Same output on the screen as I commented before, again I got to the shell
and this time I even typed some commands like ps and amazingly they still
worked, even though this was supposed to be halted.
Hope that helps.
