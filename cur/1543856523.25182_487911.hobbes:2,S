Well it is built by PLX, and from lsusb I see are:
0525:127a Netchip Technology, Inc. 
The hardware is a little rectangular pcb board a little smaller
then a business card.  Wrapped in a blue case, with vertical vents
on both of the long sides, and gets a little warm when you have been
running it for a while.  The device has what appears to be 2 normal
host to slave cables running into it.
The picture at the bottom of:

Looks like what I have.  I'm curious about the whole plug both
ends into the host before plugging it into the client, and about
the strange target system BIOS requirements.
I think I succeeded in making it work without out that by just putting
in a reset.  It does make the whole setup of the device a pain though.

Very odd.  I'm pretty certain we are talking same thing.  But I do
know it has a couple of weird quirks, so maybe you just ran up against
that.

Well at least this means after it works I can probably forget about
it and let someone else maintain the code ;)
