	If there is an error, an error event must be returned. An edge-triggered
interface must report every event that occurs with an indication of that
type.

	If the connection closes and the edge-triggered interface does not give a
HUP indication, then it is broken.
	A HUP is not a read event and signalling a read is not sufficient.
