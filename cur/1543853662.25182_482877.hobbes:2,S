The node has just empty-zone. pgdat/per-cpu-area is allocated on an other
(nearest) node.
I hear some vender's machine has this configuration. (ia64, maybe SGI or HP)
Node0: CPUx0 + XXXGb memory
Node1: CPUx2 + 16MB memory
Node2: CPUx2 + 16MB memory
memory of Node1 and Node2 is tirmmed at boot by GRANULE alignment.
Then, final view is
Node0 : memory-only-node
Node1 : cpu-only-node
Node2 : cpu-only-node.
