I understand the slowdown, but 78% are too large.
With my patch applied, the read syscall probably returns after 4608
bytes instead of all 32 kB. Could you check that you don't delay after
every syscall, but only after 32 kB are read?

I found the problem:
The current code does syscall coalescing.
On UP, I get
<<<<<<<<

20000+0 records in

<<<<<<<< [ok, it it SMP, but the 2nd cpu executes 'for(;;);']
Only 80 read syscalls are needed. With my patch applied, I'd get around
10000 syscalls.
I haven't found a simple way to fix it yet, probably I must wait until
the cache flushing functions are cleaned up.
