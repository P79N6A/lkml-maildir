Without adding support to parse " and ' it is unacceptable. I have
dozens of scripts which use argument with spaces inside... Also
all references I was able to found talks about "single optional
argument" (SCO, AIX)... Try running script containing
#! /bin/ls a b c
on your favorite system. If it will report
'/bin/ls: a b c: No such file or directory', or 
'ls: 0653-341 The file a b c does not exist', system does not split
argument on spaces. If it will talk about 'a' not found, it splits them
on spaces.
And because of I was not able to find anything in POSIX which would say
that we should do split on spaces (not that I found that we should not), 
I vote for leaving current behavior in Linux, and fixing perl manpage 
(and eventually FreeBSD, if anyone is interested) instead.
