On the other hand it's a bug if a process stays in D-state for time of
order of seconds or more. Unfortunately it's impossible to avoid this
in networking filesystems with current state of VFS (in 2.4). Even there
though, it's a bug if it's indefinite.
These problems were already discussed on LKML, you might want to search
the archive. IIRC this is a known problem of OpenAFS (not in standart
kernel). It was reported with various drivers for some 2.4.x kernels
too.
