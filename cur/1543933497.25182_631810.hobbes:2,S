Well, it seems that if one had a checked (debug) build of Windows (or at 
least the acpi.sys driver) installed, as well as a copy of the Microsoft 
ASL compiler, they could compile and temporarily override the DSDT with 
a hacked one that would output what the device power states were in some 
fashion (maybe through the kernel debugger). Some info about this here:

I suspect that might require more Windows hacking skill and/or 
motivation than one might be likely to find on this list, though :-)
