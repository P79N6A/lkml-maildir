I do not want to be flammed, but source file itself is still LGPLed,
so stating "GPL" in source is at least misleading to users who will use 
same source under NT kernel. I think that modutils (if anyone) should know 
this metamorphose.
And license on the file itself definitely does not change by compilation,
as this would for example change glibc licensing to GPL just by anyone
linking his GPLed application statically with glibc.
