I read linux kernel 2.2.13 source code,and found that in the file
'arch/i386/kernel/process.c',the switch_to function use inline asm 'ltr' to
load task register,which I thought could be loaded automatically when the
asm code such as 'iretd','ljmp' or 'call' is executed. anyone knows why it
still use 'ltr' there?
best regards
