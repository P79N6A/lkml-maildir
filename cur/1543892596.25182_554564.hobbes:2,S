Subject: ThinkPad T41 - Strange USB 2.0 behaviour

Hi,
On my ThinkPad T41 USB 2.0 behaves strange. Most USB 2.0 devices, refuse 
to function as such. Under Windows I get a message that I should plug 
the device into a USB 2.0 port (but it continues to function as USB 
1.1), while under Linux I need to manually unload ehci-hcd before I can 
access the device.
The strange thing is that these USB 2.0 devices used to work just fine, 
and still do on other machines. In addition I have one USB 2.0 memory 
key that still works fine (both under Windows and Linux).
Now to be honest, I think this is a hardware problem, as I have had 
another T41p before that also suddenly no longer liked USB 2.0 devices, 
and if you search with Google you find other ThinkPad T41 users 
complaining about similar behaviour.
As such I don't really expect a fix for this (presumably) hardware 
issue, but what I would like is that Linux would drop back to USB 1.1 
like Windows does, if for some reason USB 2.0 does not function (clearly 
with an appropriate message in at least syslog, perhaps even some 
notification with DBUS if possible).
