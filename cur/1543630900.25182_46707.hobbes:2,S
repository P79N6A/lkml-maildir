kbuild-2.5 is big enough to already be a problem to be accepted
'all in one go'. Adding driver.conf support will just make this problem
bigger. What Keith has already needs to somehow be done gradually.
How this happens isn't exactly obvious to me however. Due to the way
things like dependancy calculation have changed, you can't for example
do the merging on a per-directory basis and say "drivers this time",
"now the filesystems" etc..
Whilst kbuild2.5 lives happily with the old kbuild still being in the
tree, it doesn't support building one dir with newstyle, and another
with oldstyle. I don't even want to *think* about whats involved to
make that work, and I imagine Keith doesn't either.

Don't confuse the build system with the configuration system.
Whilst they are somewhat intertwined, they are not dependant on each other.

That effort has already been done. kbuild2.5 can live alongside the
existing build system.

Sadly, all too true these days.
