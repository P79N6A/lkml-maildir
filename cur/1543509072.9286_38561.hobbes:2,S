Not by much.
The reason there are two structures in my scheme is because the table
entries may be marked __initdata in a few cases.  Although when a driver
supports CardBus/hot-swap-PCI/docking-stations, __initdata rarely applies.

There are many cases where I would have used subsystem ID if it has been
easy to do.  Instead I used some other indicator, such as EEPROM contents.

This has already been discussed.  Most device need only a reasonable
non-zero latency setting, not a specific one.  A zero latency setting is the
result of buggy older BIOSes, and drivers have individual fix-ups because
older kernels didn't provide a way to do this.
An example of boards that are exceptions are the 3c590 and 3c595, which must
have their latency register set to 248 to avoid a chip bug.  Other devices
supported by the same driver don't have a specific minimum setting.  It's
reasonable, and more obviously a bug-work-around, to have the driver do a
rare patch-up such as this.
[[ Note: This work-around has no operational impact.  The ancient 3c590
series cannot do a long enough burst to hog the PCI bus. ]]

My approach specifically does *not* do request_region().  That occurs only
when the device is recognized and named.  For network drivers that's the
"eth0" name, which isn't known at probe1() time.  In some cases a probe1()
routine will reject the device, and the region shouldn't be registered.

There are nightmare devices that use all five base address registers.  But
they usually full of other nightmare design decisions that prevents any
regular scheme from working.  Most non-bridge devices have matching memory
and I/O space mappings, and sometime use the boot ROM register.  I see fewer
exceptions to this than when PCI was new.
[[ In fact the only unusual mapping I've seen recently is the new HCF soft
modem.  The primary access is through a memory region, and an 8 byte I/O
region is provided to emulate a regular serial port.  Accesses to the I/O
space causes a PCI interrupt, and the driver writes the updated 16550-like
register values. This allows a MS-DOS driver to be written, removing our
primary "does it work in MS-DOS" identification for a Winmodem.  But,
ignoring all of that, a Linux driver would still use only a single PCI
mapping.  ]]
