Johannes:
This is a known bogus warning. You can safely ignore it.
David, Ingo:
[ Ok, so we know that XFS wants to lock inodes in ascending inode number
order and not strictly the parent-first-child-second order that rest of the fs/
code does, so that makes it difficult to teach lockdep about this kind of lock
ordering ... ]
However, this (bogus) warning still causes way too much noise on the lists
(2-3 or more every week?) and most users wouldn't understand how or why
this warning is bogus, so would get unnecessarily disturbed about it.
Could there be a way to whitelist such "known bogus cases" in lockdep
and stop it from complaining?
