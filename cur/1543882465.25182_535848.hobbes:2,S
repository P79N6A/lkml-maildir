No. The snapshot is just that. A snapshot in time. From kernel point of 
view, it doesn't matter one bit what when you did it or if the state has 
changed before you resume. It's up to userspace to make sure the user 
doesn't do real work while the snapshot is being written to disk and 
machine is shut down.

When the snapshot pages are COW, we will run out of memory if userspace 
writes to those pages too much. If userspace is blocked, say like 
displaying a "we are suspending" in X which blocks the user from using 
other programs that could generate new writes and mounting filesystems 
read-only, we don't need to worry about running out of memory.
