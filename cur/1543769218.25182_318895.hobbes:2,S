For a _developer_ yes.
For a user under X, who finds his machine locked up and not doing 
anything, no.
And this is _exactly_ why we don't enable it by default. Go wild on your 
own machines - I used to do it myself. But users are better off with 
working machines.
IOW, testing is good, but it's _not_ good if you test your users to 
destruction.  User testing should be limited (as far as humanly possible) 
to things that they can sanely report.
