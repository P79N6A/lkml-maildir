Hi,
There are known issues with USB after suspend/resume (D3 hot) on
powerpc. For example, plugging or unplugging devices during sleep
results in oopses at resume; and one time out of two, the USB ports are
unpowered on resume (because the registers think they are, and
linux doesn't repower them. but they're not).
Both of these issues have patches available, patches that can be found
there for example:
http://colino.net/ibookg4/usb-ohci-fixes.patch
http://colino.net/ibookg4/usb-ehci-power.patch
What kind of work on these is needed so that they get in?
Thanks,
-- 
Colin
