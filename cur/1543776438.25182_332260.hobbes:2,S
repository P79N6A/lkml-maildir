And, remember, there are other things affected by depth of the tree 
anyway.  For that matter, most of the time, when you push a system past 
"reasonable assumptions", you hit performance issues, if not stability 
ones.  Most everything but Reiser assumes that you won't have "too many" 
files in a directory, or "too many" small files in the FS as a whole.
I think it's fair to assume people will keep things "reasonable", 
especially if we tell them what "reasonable" means.  As in, "This is the 
kind of organization which Reiser4 handles really well, and this is the 
kind of organization which will absolutely kill your performance."
