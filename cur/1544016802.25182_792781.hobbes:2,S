Stumbled upon ftrace tracepoints while writing this patch. Should
make life a lot easier for debugging latency issues.
bhlockup should complement ftrace. Once you've found that there's a
problem, tracing can be a big help in debugging. But assertions are
nice for finding problems you didn't know exist.
