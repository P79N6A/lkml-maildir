I'd love to see a hardware-aware DM RAID module, since I want to do the
same thing for sata_sx4 (Promise SX4).
SX4 has four ATA engines, an on-card ECC-capable DIMM, and an on-card
XOR engine.  The OS driver has complete control over these facilities.
Unfortunately, driving the card in "dumb mode" means that performance
takes a major hit, since each transaction looks like:
	submit DMA memcpy to HDMA engine
	get HDMA interrupt
		# now, the data is on the card
	submit ATA write command
	get ATA interrupt
All data must be copied to/from the DIMM, before the ATA engine can do
anything.  Further, there is only one HDMA engine, but 4 ATA engines.
Ideally, RAID1 would copy the data to the card ONCE, then start 2 ATA
engines.  Ideally, RAID5 would copy the data to the card ONCE, XOR it,
then start the ATA engines.  And the rest of the DIMM should be used as
write-through cache.
I'm sure DM can do that, but I haven't researched how.
I'll supply a card (and engineering help, but no docs, alas) to anyone
interested in trying out this stuff.
