device-backed loops are ok, file-based once aren't. The cache issue
you talk about concerns writing caches of HDDs f.e., I haven't seen a
flash device with writing cache. However, in most cases writing cache
can be turned off.
Go with README in the loop-aes package. Don't use cryptoloop, it's
insecure.

You shouldn't do that. One more option is, in case you feel lucky and
space is not of great concern, ecryptfs in latest kernels. It's still
experimental but its roadmap looks promising. And they need testers
;-)
