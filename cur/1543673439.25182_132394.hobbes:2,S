This was a very handy feature which could be used with DCE/DFS. It is especially 
nice if the cost of obtaining credentials is high, vs the amount of 
processing being done, for example if the user is running a script, and doing 
multiple kerberos rsh commands to a host, if the rshd could join a PAG,
it would not need to received delegated credentials for each connection,
as it could use the credentials that where delegated earlier. 
It could can also be used as a way to refresh credentials.
