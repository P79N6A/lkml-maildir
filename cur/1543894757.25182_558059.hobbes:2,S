You've just made my point for me.
Those "Hundreds of pages of parliamentary discussions" are *exactly* because 
the intent of the law is being made *clear* at the same time the law is being 
written. If the GPL is intended to cover situation like tivoization it isn't 
made clear by the preamble at all - and the fact that the GPL, in version 2, 
at least, *specifically* limits its scope to *THREE* "activities" also 
creates a problem for your argument.
To quote: "Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are 
not covered by this License; they are outside its scope."
To try and claim that it is the *INTENT* or the *SPIRIT* of a piece of legal 
text that contains such specific limiting text is idiotic. I may not be a 
lawyer - hell, I may not have a degree of any kind - but I do know that a 
clear and unambiguous statement like that can't be argued to mean anything 
different *without* twisting the meaning of - or giving extra meaning to - 
some of the words.
