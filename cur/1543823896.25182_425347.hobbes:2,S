Hi John,
  While cpu downclocking helps a bit, it would be hopelessly inaccurate
for figuring out if your app would run fast enough on the given
ancient machine.  A lot else has happened to the world since the days
of the 200MHz CPU:
    * Faster memory
    * Larger caches
    * Faster PCI busses
    * Instruction set additions (various more levels of SSE etc)
    * Faster discs
    * Changes to the CPU architecture/implementation
Still, it would be interesting to see the difference in performance
of a downclocked modern processor and its 10 year old clock equivalent.
Dave
