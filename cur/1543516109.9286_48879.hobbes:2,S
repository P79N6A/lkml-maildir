Hey, that might work ... but they should only have to provide the
"secret" for the first post.  And known clueful posters (say, anyone in
CREDITS or MAINTAINERS, plus anyone who has posted Useful Things in the
last two months) could be grandfathered.
However, all this would have the same unfortunate effect as a
closed-posting list -- cutting off a lot of bug reports....
