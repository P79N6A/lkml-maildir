My man page says "Stack fault on coprocessor". Hm. What co-processor?
Oh! My 387! At the least, exactly what SIGSTKFLT is delivered for
should be properly and clearly documented.
State is first saved on the kernel stack. If you want to catch a
signal, you need space in the user-space stack. Boom!
So, in low-memory situations, a growing stack can only result in a
signal that either suspends or kills the process. I don't call that
"deterministic" either. You may as well be buggered by the OOM killer.
