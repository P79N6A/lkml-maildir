You've always been able to do that- this is a bad example of what I meant
sorry.
Instead think of
	while(time_before(time, jiffies))
	{
		if(inb(driver->port+STATUS)&0x01)
			break;
		schedule();
	}
which is the case I meant - where you need to wait for a driver to do 
something slow, polled and can't just delay.
