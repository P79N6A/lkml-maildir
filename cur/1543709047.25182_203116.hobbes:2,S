Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.4-rc1 fix x86 early_printk and make it early
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Trying to use early_printk on x86 I found two issues.
- setup_early_printk is currently called much later than necessary.
- VGABASE is using an identity mapped physical address on x86.
  o That is problematic with PAE support, because there is a moment
    during paging_init() when the physical identity mappings do not
    work. 
  o Using raw physical addresses is in bad form, and doesn't always work.
  o I can't possibly see how Andrew's Changelog that using __pa
    is more friendly to the 4G/4G split is correct.  Unless someone
    was hard coding a virtual address previously.
The first hunk of this patch moves setup_early_printk as
early as possible on x86.
The second hunk in early_printk.c redefines VGABASE as __va(0xb8000).
This is correct on both x86 and x86-64 so we don't need any more
special cases.  The only thing that might be slightly more correct
would be to use isa_readw/isa_writew but the only difference is
in where PAGE_OFFSET is added in.
