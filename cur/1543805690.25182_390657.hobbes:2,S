I would say that the patches to support critical sockets will be 
slightly more complex with mempools
than the earlier patches that used the global critical page pool with a 
new GFP_CRITICAL flag.
Basically we need a facility to mark an allocation request as critical 
and satisfy this request without
any blocking in an emergency situation.
