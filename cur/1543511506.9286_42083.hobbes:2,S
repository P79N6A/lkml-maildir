Attached demo shows technique that can overcome 256 character limit on the
VGA console. Program manages visible glyphs so that limited is only number
characters on screen, not the number of characters that can be displayed.
Adding this mechanism to the kernel console driver is not easy because of
its codepage nature (driver receives code number in current codepage,
not the unicode). Even fb console has this limit.
I am looking for somebody with kernel programming experience enough to add
it to the console.
Note: You should run this demo on the VGA console with 9x16 font.
Future versions (if any) will be available at
