Side note i can actually wiggle a mozilla window around a 2000x2000@24bit 
display with make -j2 going and 'display window contents while moving' now in 
KDE3 w/ kwin. I normally have it on wireframe. X server is the XFree86 
radeon driver w/ a 9100 and 128Mb of video memory, system is dual 400, 
512Mb ram.
