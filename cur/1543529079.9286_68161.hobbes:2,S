Hey All!
	Just tried upgrading one of my RedHat 6.1 systems from 2.3.49 to
2.3.50 and got some good news, some bad news, and some worse news.
	The good news is...
	My problem with NULL pointer dereference when ide1 is enabled but
ide0 is disabled seems to be fix!  Yeah!
	Looks like the unresolved symbol problem in rd as a modules is also
fixed.
	Now for the bad news.
	As someone else has reported "make xconfig" is still broken, but
broken with a different error than 2.3.49.
	Building 2.3.50 with sound as a module results in compiler errors.

	Ok...  I can live without sound for a bit...
	Now for the worse news.
	Once I had 2.3.50 build and had rebooted to it, I found that X would
no longer work.  It complains about being unable to connect to the font
server.  Welllllll...  Low and behold, xfs had failed to start.  Trying
to start xfs by hand resulted on complaints that it was unable to start
a local listener.  It appears that it is haveing trouble getting a unix
domain socket set up.  It's trying to set up /tmp/.font-unix/fs-1 and
failing for some reason.  Works just fine on 2.3.49.  It doesn't give me
an error code, so I can't tell what's wrong.
	So, 2.3.50, which has a fix that I want, becomes a non-starter
for me.  :-(
	Mike
