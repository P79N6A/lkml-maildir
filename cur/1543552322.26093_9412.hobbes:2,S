It's actually quite reasonable for sound effects. Stuff like beeps and 
boings to announce talk requests, new mail, etc. But yes, playing mp3s on 
it does suck somewhat :)

Note that the latter is also supported by the PCSP driver, and has to play 
the same evil timer tricks. When I finally get round to shifting the system 
timer onto the RTC so the PCSP driver can have the 8253 all to itself, 
the PCSP driver will be a lot nicer. It doesn't impact the system 
performance that much at all.
