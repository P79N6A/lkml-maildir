grrr, Mozilla cannot seem to quote your message properly.  anyway...
Given the output you just provided, 8139too is indeed the only driver 
that will work for you.
WRT pci-skeleton.c I think that is a red herring for you... 8139cp 
support is available from 8139cp.c.  But given the lspci output, it will 
not work for you...
thanks!
