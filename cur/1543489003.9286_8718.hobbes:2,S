	>TEXT:
	>
	>The government of Afghanistan is waging a war upon women. The
situation
	>is getting so bad that one person in an editorial of the Times
compared
	>the treatment of women there to the treatment of Jews in
pre-Holocaust
	>Poland. Since the Taliban took power in 1996, women have had to
wear
	>burqua and have been beaten and stoned in public for not having the
	>proper attire, even if this means simply not having the mesh
covering
	>in front of their eyes. One woman was beaten to DEATH by an angry
mob
of
	>fundamentalists for accidentally exposing her arm while she was
driving.
	>Another was stoned to death for trying to leave the country with a
man
	>that was not a  relative. Women are not allowed to work or even go
out
	>in public without a male relative; professional women such as
	>professors, trans-lators, doctors, lawyers,artists and writers have
	>been forced from their jobs and stuffed into their homes, so that
	>depress
	>ion
	>is becoming so widespread that it has reached emergency levels.
	>There is no way in such an extreme Islamic society to know the
suicide
	>rate with certainty, but relief workers are estimating that the
suicide
	>rate among women, who cannot find proper medication and treatment
for
	>severe depression and would rather take their lives than live in
such
	>conditions, has increased significantly. Homes where a woman is
present
	>
	>must have their windows painted so that she can never be seen by
	>outsiders. They must wear silent shoes so that they are never
heard.
	>Women live in fear of their lives for the slightest misbehavior.
Because
	>they cannot work, those without male relatives or husbands are
either
	>starving to death or begging on the street, even if they hold
Ph.D.'s.
	>There are almost no medical facilities available for women, and
relief
	>workers, in protest, have mostly left the country,taking medicine
and
	>psychologists and other things necessary to treat the sky-rocketing
	>level of depression among women.
	>At one of the rare hospitals for women, a reporter found still,
	>nearly lifeless bodies lying motionless on top of beds, wrapped in
	>their burqua, unwilling to speak, eat, or do anything, but slowly
	>wasting
	>away. Others have gone mad and were seen crouched in corners,
	>perpetually rocking or crying, most of them in fear. One doctor is
	>considering, when what little medication that is left finally runs
out,
	>
	>leaving these women in front of the president's residence as a form
of
	>peaceful protest. It is at the point where the term 'human rights
	>violations' has become an understatement. Husbands have the power
of
	>life and death over their women relatives, especially their wives,
but
	>an angry mob has just as much right to stone or beat a woman, often
to
	>death, for exposing an inch of flesh or offending them in the
slightest
	>w
	>ay.
	>
	>David Cornwell has told me that we in the United States should not
	>judge the Afghan people for such treatment because it is a
'cultural
	>thin
	>g',
	>but this is not even true. Women enjoyed relative freedom, to work,
	>dress generally as they wanted, and drive and appear in public
alone
	>until only 1996 -- the rapidity of this transition is the main
reason
	>for the depression and suicide; women who were once educators for
	>doctors or simply used to basic human freedoms are now severely
	>restricted and treated as sub-human in the name of right-wing
	>fundamentalist Islam.  It is not their tradition or 'culture', but
is
	>alien to them, and it is  extreme even for those cultures where
	>fundamentalism is the rule. Besides, if we could excuse everything
on
	>cultural grounds, then we should not be appalled that the
Carthaginians
	>
	>sacrificed their infant children, that little girls are circumcised
in
	>parts of Africa, that blacks in the deep south in the 1930's were
	>lynched, prohibited from voting, and forced to submit to unjust Jim
	>Crow laws.
	>Everyone has a right to a tolerable human existence, even if they
are
	>women in a Muslim country in a part of the world that Americans do
not
	>understand. If we can threaten military force in Kosovo in the name
of
	>human rights for the sake of ethnic Albanians, Americans can
certainly
	>express peaceful out-rage at the oppression, murder and injustice
	>committed against women by the Taliban.

	>************ STATEMENT:
	>
	>In signing this, we agree that the current treatment of women in
	>Afghanistan is completely UNACCEPTABLE and deserves support and
action
	>by the people of the United States and other countries and their
	>Governments and that the current situation in Afghanistan will not
be
	>tolerated.  Women's Rights is not a small issue anywhere and it is
	>UNACCEPTABLE for women in 1998 to be treated as sub-human and so
much
	>as property. Equality and human decency is a RIGHT not a freedom,
	>whether
	>one lives in Afghanistan or the United States.*****
