I used to have a per-device interface, but thought the interface might
be hard to use for users. If we really need the per-device interface, I
can re-add it.

Yes, at least in my test.

Another way is to provide a helper for driver, and driver disables
specific ASPM states. It sounds better to let driver do the disabling,
as users haven't the knowledge?
