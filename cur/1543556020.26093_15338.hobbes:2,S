  Is there anything more recent than VM-global-2.2.18pre18-7?  It isn't
patching very cleanly against my pre-patch-2.2.18-23 tree. 
  (I don't see anything under your pre19 thru pre23 dirs, but I
   may not be looking at a fully populated server or something.)
  Reiserfs on top of 2.2.18-23 blatantly runs me out of memory, and ext3fs
may be doing it too, although the laptop fan makes it sounds like it is
busy-looping somewhere.
