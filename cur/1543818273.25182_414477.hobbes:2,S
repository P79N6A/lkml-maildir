  Hello,
  to join the series of git-related announcements, Cogito-0.17.2, the next
maintenance release on the current stable (v0.17) branch of Cogito, the
human-friendly version control system on top of Git, is available now.
  There are only very few changes, it looks that we are pretty stable:
Chris Wright:
      cogito spec BuildRequires update
Dennis Stosberg:
      cogito: Push tags over http
Petr Baudis:
      Improved cg-version output (use cg-object-id -d)
      cg-patch -c: Stop also at ^diff --git when slurping the commit message
      Fixed embarassing cg-admin-rewritehist bug
      Make cg-add/rm warnings less confusing: s/files/items/
      cogito-0.17.2
P.S.: Visit us at #git @ FreeNode!
  Happy hacking,
--
