Win98 definately seems to tie drivers to their topological position --
if I move a usb mouse from one port of a hub to another it installs
the driver again (requiring the CD).  Bleagh.
BeOS doesn't offer an unified solution -- we do have a devfs (there are
no dev special files in our world) and devices are able to publish an
arbitrary list of names.  The USB mouse/keyboard driver just publishes
/dev/input/mouse/usb/%d and /dev/input/keyboard/usb/%d, assigning numbers
on a first-come first-served basis. 
Of course the input_server node monitors /dev/input/... and receives
a message when a new device is published and will then open it and
start listening to it (actually an input server add-on handles talking
to the device).
