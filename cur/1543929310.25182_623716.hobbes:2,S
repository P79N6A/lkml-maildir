Ah, sorry - the system came back and  I could continue my work.
However I couldn't hibernate my system (I tried it 2 additional times) 
as long as
my user mode linux image was running (2.6.23 UML kernel). Within UML I 
ran cupsd to which firefox
was trying to make a connection. Firefox itself was waiting for a 
response of the cupsd server,
the cupsd itself was generating the ssl -files under /etc/cupsd/ssl as 
far as I could read from the cupsd log.

I pressed <Fn>+<F12> to hibernate the system, and b/c the scrren was 
black and came back some secs later I had have a look into
/var/log/message and copied the outout into my first mail.
