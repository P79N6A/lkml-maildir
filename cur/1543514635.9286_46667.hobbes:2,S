I don't think you can rely on there being a linear relationship
between clock speed and bogomips, even for the same machine. I recall
seeing a non-linear relationship on the Dell Inspiron 3200 when
suspend mode is pending (i.e. after you close the lid, but before the
kernel completes the suspend). While I didn't analyse it carefully, it
appeared that CPU speed and memory speeds varied by different factors.
Granted this was a special case (we don't care about bogomips when
suspending), it suggests that we should be careful before making the
assumption that APM will slow down the system in a simple fashion.
