Thanks for taking a look, and replying in such detail, Jeff
(I'm afraid you overestimate my understanding of this area!)

Ah, that's a pity.  I see what you mean.

Though that seems a considerable overstatement: ata_busy_sleep doesn't
shake anything, it just hangs around reading and testing a flag (in a
bewildering series of slightly different loops).  I guess even reading
status must be viewed as "a good hard shake" at this upper level.

Can it do harm on any hardware to wait for ATA_BUSY to clear there?
Would it be less of a violation to do it in ata_scsi_device_resume?
Or should ata_piix.c have its own .resume to add this in?  Or....

As you can see from my questions, I haven't a clue around here.  So for
now I'll just have to keep that ata_busy_sleep with the patches I apply
to my kernel, until someone with a clue makes it redundant.  And it is
now there in the LKML archives for those who find it useful.
