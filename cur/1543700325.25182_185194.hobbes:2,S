Ok. I've attached the find load log. Doesn't feel different from the dd
disk load case. Quality is almost undisturbed.

Ok. I will try it then.

Is this patch supposed to be different schedulerwise from the scheduler
rollup patches against 2.6.0-testx

What's the railroad to me ?
I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows, 
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing.
                      (Henry David Thoreau)
