I'll raise this issue before the 2.3.18 ac patches will grow to mbytes in
size ;).
Would it be possible to make the 2.3.18ac patches as incremental (as the
pre-2.2.0?) and not every time against the official 2.3.18? It would avoid
me to waste some time and bandwith ;).
If it's a problem for you feel free to continue as now of course. I ask
only in case it make no differences for you and for others.
