I've already had problems with pcnet32 (but they were 79c971). Basically,
connected to a 100 full-duplex, they would suddenly switch back to half
duplex under heavy load, and then I got very very low speeds of course.
Since yours works in UP, this may not be related to the same problem, but who
knows ?  I see in your dmesg that the card is connected to a 10 half link. Have
you tried a 100 Mbps just in case ?
Regards,
Willy
