The main reason is that several kvm exciting features are dependent on
mmu notifiers:
- It enables full guest swapping (as opposed to partial today)
- It enables memory ballooning
- It enables running Izik Eidus's Kernel Shared Pages module that unify
  guest pages together.
The patchset is kernel-internal, stable and reviewed. Even if the
interface will be changed in .26 it won't have noticeable effect.
So since its stable, internal, reviewed, needed to enable important kvm
features we like to see it in for .25.
