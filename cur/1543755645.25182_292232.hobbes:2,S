I guess that I thought that it was overkill for the problem under 
discussion and probably won't solve it anyway.  Giving any task special 
preferential (emphasis on the preferential) treatment should require 
authorization by a suitably privileged entity at some stage.  So the 
problem of how ordinary users manage to launch tasks that receive 
preferential treatment will remain.

Sorry for upsetting you,
