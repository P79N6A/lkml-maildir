Hmm, its already the second report in this, but I can't reproduce it.  
I've tested on a iMac with 2.3.51.  devfs also compiled in, it makes no
difference whenever devfs is mounted on boot or not.  My intel box with
2.2.13 and the same bttv driver version doesn't show this either...
Can you dig some more to find what exactly causes this?
