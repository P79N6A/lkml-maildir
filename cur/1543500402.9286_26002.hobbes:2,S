Maybe, especially if/when root ceases to mean anything special.
This (and the mmap issue) are some of the difficult issues that
the BSD people avoided merely by ignoring them (only root can
use revoke(), and it doesn't affect mapped areas).
I believe that the call is generally useful and should be made
available to users, rather than being restricted to CAP_REVOKE
or CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE.
The semantic issues are hard, though.
Matthew.
