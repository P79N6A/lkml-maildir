Alan,
I was trying to re-install my VMware with the latest 2.2.18 kernel.
It failed to try to re-compile the modules.
--------------------
What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your 
running kernel? [/usr/src/linux/include]
The directory of kernel headers (version 2.2.17) does not match your 
running
kernel (version 2.2.18). Consequently, even if the compilation of the 
module wassuccessful, the module would not load into the running kernel.
-----------------------
Upon inspection of /usr/src/linux/include/linux/version.h
it plainly says 2.2.17.... ????  I changed it to 2.2.18 and all is well.
