The problem with SELinux isn't the theory. It's the practice. 
IOW, it's too hard to use.
Apparently Ubuntu is giving up on it too, for that reason.
And what some people seem to have trouble admitting is that theory counts 
for nothing, if the practice isn't there.
So quite frankly, the SELinux people would look at whole lot smarter if 
they didn't blather on about "theory".
