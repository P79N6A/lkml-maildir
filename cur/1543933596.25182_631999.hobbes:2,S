Right, sorry for not including it originally:

As you can see, the {drivers/ -> virt/, arch/x86/} transition dominates 
the diffstat.  Note that this does not include ia64 support, which is 
planned for the 2.6.25 merge window and only awaits a bit of paperwork.
The Kconfig/Makefile changes which are probably most of interest to you 
should arrive in the last batch.
