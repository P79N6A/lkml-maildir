CAP_REG_EXEC seems meaningless, I can do the same with mmap by hand for
most types of binary execution except setuid (which is separate it
seems)
Given the capability model is accepted as inferior to things like
SELinux policies why do we actually want to fix this anyway. It's
unfortunate we can't discard the existing capabilities model (which has
flaws) as well really.
