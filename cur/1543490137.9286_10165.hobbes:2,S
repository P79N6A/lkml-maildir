Do you want to share any reasons for this bad claim? The fact that staroffice
uses undocumented functions in 2.0 that were removed in 2.1 is an established
fact.
And yes, staroffice is broken. If you claim otherwise you really have to back
this up (but you can't).
It is a big deal, as many distributions wanted to switch to 2.1 but couldn't,
because suddenly a few of the comemrcial programs stopped working.
