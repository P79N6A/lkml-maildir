For such an application, we'd have to provide a mechanism to allow an
application to set/clear a page's Nosave flag. We'd probably also want
to be able to notify user space that a suspend cycle has just occurred
and the page contents are invalid.

It would be possible with Suspend2 - one could implement a backend (page
transformer or writer) that implemented encryption and required the user
to enter a passphrase at resume time.

Yes. Or close all gpg apps before suspending?
