  I would assume if someone was setting the affinity from /proc they
would have disabled the kernel irqbalancer and the flag
irqbalance_disabled would be set.
  What I am trying to avoid is a branching for both kirqd and user space
setting affinity.  I see though I hadn't fully thought out user trying
to set affinity and have for following idea.  This would also make
Martin happy :)

 This would make the /proc call tie into kirqd in cases where the
irq_balance has not been disabled.

  It don't think it is the ioapic_lock we would need to hold it would be
the desc->lock.  This is also early in the boot sequence, but I could
grab the lock anyway.

   The real issue is in clustered apic mode not all possible masks are
possible.  If flat mode you have 8 bits (00000000) where each bit
represents a cpu.  In clusterd mode you have 8 bits (0000-node id
0000-cpu id) also.  If the cpu mask you want to write has cpus on
different nodes it impossible (except in special cases) to write that
value the ioapic.  
  In clustered apic mode I can only mask an irq to a single cpu, cpus on
the same node, all cpus, or I beleive the Nth cpu on every node.  It
can't do everything flat apic mode can.  This makes it difficult to
decide what a real fix should be.
