I don't see anything attached :(

/proc is for process information originally, it grew to take lots of
other different things over the years.
/sys is a tree representation of the devices in the system, as well as a
location for a lot of other kernel specific information.  The rules for
/sys are much more strict (one value per file, if the file isn't there,
the userspace program must be able to handle it, etc.)

Yes, migration of this information to the ABI/ directory would be very
good to have.

Sounds good to me, but be sure to verify this with the networking
developers as well.
