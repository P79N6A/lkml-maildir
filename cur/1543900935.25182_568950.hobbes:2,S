Nope.  I stick a "Cc: <stable@kernel.org>" into the changelog and then
magic happens: the -stable maintainers get a copy of the patch when it goes
to Linus, they get notification when I drop it after Linus merged it and
then they (hopeully) take the patch from Linus's tree.
(But the last step is a bit of a hassle - I suspect they take my emailed
version instead, but it would be super-rare for that to differ from the
version which Linus merged)
