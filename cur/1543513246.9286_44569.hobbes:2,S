	I can't be sure, but I would guess that you're seeing a subtle
problem with connection timeouts.
	In an ftp transfer, the control channel (always to port 21) is
opened first to handle all of the login, and high level communication
work.  When actual data has to be transferred (either a directory listing
or a file transfer), a second channel is opened.
	While a large file is being transferred, the data channel sits
idle.  If your file transfer takes longer than the tcp timeout on your
masquerading box, that box removes the control channel from its list of
open tcp connections.  When the file transfer is complete, the ftp client
attempts to handle some housekeeping chores over the control channel, but
the masquerading box not longer has any record of how to talk over that
channel.  In short, even though the client and server both believe the
control channel is open, the masquerading box refuses to masquerade that
connection anymore.
	The solution is simple - increase the timeout on the masuqerading
box.  To increase the timeout to 8 hours (28800 seconds), use the
following:
ipchains -M -S 28800 0 0
	Those still using ipfwadm need to use:
ipfwadm -M -s 28800 0 0
	instead.
	Unless someone believes there is still a specific kernel bug
involved in this problem, I would suggest that this thread move to the
ip-masq mailing list.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
