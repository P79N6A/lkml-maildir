well, when a CPU goes down it could process the migration request queue as
well. (this would be a pretty natural thing to do if CPU-down executes in
the migration-thread context.)
Another question is user-space semantics - if user-space relies on CPU
affinity, is the kernel allowed to violate it or should the process be
notified. Sending it a signal (SIGTERM or anything similar) if the
affinity was non-generic might be a good thing to do.
