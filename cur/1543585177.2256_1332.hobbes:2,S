No, that can't happen.
VMA changes only happen if both the mmap_sem and the page table lock is
acquired. (check insert_vm() at the end of mm/mmap.c)
The page fault path uses the map_sem, kswaps uses page_table_lock.

Why do you acquire the mmap semaphore in swapout_mm()? The old rule was
that kswapd should never sleep on the mmap semaphore. Isn't there a
deadlock if mmap sem is already acquired? I don't remember the details.

I remember that the pmd_alloc() and pte_alloc() functions need
additional locking.
