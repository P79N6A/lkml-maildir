You may do it like ssh: encrypt the private key with a symmetric cypher using 
a key based on a passphrase and store it on disk (of course this is only as 
secure as your passphrase).
On suspend: generate a symmetric-key KS, save memory to harddisk encrypted 
with KS, append the KS enrypted with the public key A_PUB. append the private 
encrypted key A_PRIV_ENCR_BASED_ON_PASSPHRASE  (which is stored on the 
harddisk). On resume user must type in passphrase, then we can decrypt 
A_PRIV_ENCR_BASED_ON_PASSPHRASE and get A_PRIV, decrypt KS and so decrypt 
saved memory.
