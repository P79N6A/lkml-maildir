What's "shared percpu data" ?  It sounds to me like a contradiction in
terms.  Isn't percpu data supposed to only be accessed by the CPU which
owns it to prevent cache line bouncing?  In which case, what's the point
of sharing that data with other CPUs?  Surely "shared percpu data" is
just the same as normal data?
