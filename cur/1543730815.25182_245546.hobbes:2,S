  I  thought  that  the  underlaying  FS/VFS would make sure the extra
  streams  would  be  preserved. Normal applications that doesn't have
  support  for  them  should  not  destroy the extra streams (and meta
  data,attributes etc).
  Of course tar is different, but any probgram that uses the normal OS
  API to copy, write and read files should not affect the extra info.
