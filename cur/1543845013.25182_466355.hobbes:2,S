My point is that all the numbers are invalid or incorrect.  They will cause
the arch to oops, and so need completely replacing.  So that patch you added
is incorrect and should not include asm-generic/libata-portmap.h as nothing in
there is correct on this arch.  So your patch should *not* be applied, but
should instead be replaced.

Why does the arch have to supply those numbers?  What's wrong with my
suggested patch?  According to code in libata, these are _legacy_ access
methods, and on FRV they aren't currently required, so why can't I dispense
with them if they're not needed?  Doing that not only skips legacy accesses
for ISA compatibility, it also reduces the code size by not actually emitting
the code for the accesses, thus making the kernel smaller...
