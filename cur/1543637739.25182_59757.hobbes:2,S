The 'simple ways' are only simpler because they're taking advantage of
pre-existing (and undocumented) implicit ordering. The explicit
dependencies are probably less complex on the whole as it lets you take
out a ton of per-subsystem conditional cruft and replace it with a couple
lines of dependency info.
Given that sizeof(dependency info)==sizeof(missing documentation of
dependencies), it's clear that sizeof(dependency info + support + script)
< sizeof(current ordering code + conditional cruft + missing
documentation).
