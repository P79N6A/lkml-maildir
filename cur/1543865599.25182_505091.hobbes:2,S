Regardless.  If we are serious about supporting EFI instead of just
nursing it along for the rare person stuck with it, we are going
to need to remove the brain-dead relocate exactly once to virtual addresses
call, so we can use kexec.
Therefore we will need a trampoline to switch to physical mode.
Of course that presumes the Open (but no one is allowed to read or implement
the standard, or join the committee ) EFI is sufficiently interesting at
some point to bother supporting properly.
