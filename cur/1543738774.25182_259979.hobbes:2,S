Nathan, thanks for doing that testing, the warning does indeed look to be 
a false positive. Looking at the code again, i realised that there might 
also be cases where someone does the following;
	preempt_disable();
	cpu = smp_processor_id();
	...
	preempt_enable();
	...
	mod_local_cpu_variable[cpu];
So cached values of smp_processor_id() might also be a problem, although i 
haven't found any cases, but maybe that's just being overly paranoid =)
