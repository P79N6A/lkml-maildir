Again: is in this case "isn't perfect" mean "it does not make all what we 
want" ? If yes still I don't see why not use indent + some other tool or 
if you will show real example where it does something badady (like now 
for checking code syntax is used compiler and some other tools like 
sparse).

Committing all this "noise" will plug all this thing and allow reve most 
of content Documentation/CodingStyle document.
Is it not wort stop all questions/discuss/flames on this subject ?
Again: using indent mainly will mean only one time massive changes. After 
this ident can be runed for example by Linus just before make release and/or 
partial release.

Again: anywhere are listed/was posted list of "not perfect" examples ? 
And/or: what does it mean in this case "not perfect" ? Show this  for 
allow start work on fix indent by other people (if all cases will be resul 
of some bugs in this tool).
