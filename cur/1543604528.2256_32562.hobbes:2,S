Hey people,
why do you want to separate statistics data out? The statistics are not about disk
throughput, head seek times, etc. They are just about the time between "needing a
page" and "getting that page", which is very abstract. Let's call it the
swapin-delay. It does not only depend on disk-throughput and head seek times, but
also on "device business".
For every swap device, there is a "swap_business" data structure, which covers a
- average_swapin_delay
- average_swapin_delay_last_write_timestamp /* timestamp where swapin_delay was
last written */
There is a "swap_business_memory_timeout" kernel parameter (accessible via /proc)
which represents the length of a time interval from now into the past. This
interval is to be used as the time interval where gathered disk activity data
should be used for reasoning swap decisions of the future.
For every page fault which requires a page to be swapped in, a timestamp is
written to a datastructure covering the swapin process. When the page is ready
available in memory, a function is called which does following:
- compute the current_swapin_delay for the current swapin
- my_swap_device->average_swapin_delay = (current_swapin_delay * (now -
average_swapin_delay_last_write_timestamp) + my_swap_device->average_swapin_delay
* (average_swapin_delay_last_write_timestamp - (now -
swap_business_memory_timeout))/swap_business_memory_timeout;
There are some special cases like "no disk activity". In this case, swap_business
is not updated for that device. But maybe the reason for no disk activity is that
the disk is a swap disk and the values of "swap_business" where once so bad that
this device will not be considered anymore. That would be a "soft deadlock"...
On swapout, the "average_swapin_delay" fields of every "swap_business" data
structure of every swap device is compared against same field of other available
swap devices. According to these comparision, a decision is made where to do the
next swapout to.
Because that framework only can bring advantages if there are at least two swap
devices, it can be skipped for the one-swap-device-case (most setups do not have
more than one swap device, but maybe just because the 32MB or 64MB graphics card
(with plenty of mostly unused RAM) needs to be manually configured for swap...)
I hope that you get the concept more closer. I cannot see reasons why to create
such statistics in advance and feed them to the kernel somehow. For dynamic
systems, you need dynamic statistics, I think. And "the statistics", in fact, only
consist of two variables per swap device. Not something the kernel should not be
able to manage in reasonable time.
Of course, such a feature should be tested for real advantages
Xuân.
