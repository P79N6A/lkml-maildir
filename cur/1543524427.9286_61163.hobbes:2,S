Ok then. The issue is that gcc generates internally that memset for the
local structure assignment. You can workaround it by doing what the patchlet
sais. I think this is a bug in gcc because it normally expands memcpy/memset
internally on i386.
But I wonder why i386 does not export memcpy/memset for such cases, IMHO it
should.
But the patch below gives you more efficient code anyway.
