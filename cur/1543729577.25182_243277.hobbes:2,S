After a bit of discussion on the dri lists, we have come to the decision
that it is probably necessary to retire the above driver, no dri developer
is currently using the above hardware and the driver is so different from
the others it makes a lot of hacks in the drm needed...
If anyone does actually use this driver and hardware let us know or it'll
be marked as BROKEN soon and then it will actually break :-)
Dave.
