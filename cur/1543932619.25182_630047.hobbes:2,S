Yeah, I thought the _leds str_to_int stuff was ugly, but I didn't see
a way around it without sacrificing flexibility.

The issue is more about forcing power_supply users to return an integer.
By passing them 'buf', they are allowed to fill it with whatever they
want.  OTOH, if we force (for example) CHARGE_FULL to return an integer,
then a driver that wants to format something differently doesn't have
the opportunity to do that.  I can't think of a case w/ CHARGE_FULL
where we'd want to do that, but the point is more that we shouldn't
assume we'll always know better than someone who's writing a driver
for their particular hardware.  Maybe we want to return a really large
number?  Maybe we want to return a hex number?  Perhaps we want to
pad the number with 0s?  etc..

Sure, using a strval is fine *as long* as there's a way to say "this
attribute should be passed a buf".  By having this code in
power_supply_{sysfs,core}.c, we're ensuring that users do not have the
flexibility to define such things.

Yes, most are integers, but we could certainly end up with others.
I've already pointed out how the API falls down because it attempts
to be too restrictive.
One of the reasons I proposed this API is because it has sysfs call
the power supply attributes directly.  If we attempt to have a wrapper
for struct device_attribute in power_supply_sysfs.c, we either a) force
power_supply core to determine what type/format each property, and
don't allow power_supply drivers to override that/specify their own
types, or b) include a lot of complexity to allow power_supply drivers
to specify what properties are returning.  (a) is what the current
API does, and it ends up not being flexible enough, and I'm having
a tough time wrapping my head around how to implement (b).
My preferred choice of API has power_supply drivers have callbacks
that are directly called by sysfs.
