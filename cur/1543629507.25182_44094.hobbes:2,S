I do. Since I have many kernels built, my build script copies the
important bits into there. I have done this for many years now
(as can be seen by the ancient 'soundconf' still being copied)
without any problems. /lib/modules is the only per-kernel area
on my machine and it is the most natural place to keep these files.
The failure started showing up only later in 2.4, I do not remember
exactly when but it is many months ago now. The 'not an ELF' message
was non fatal until then. I was pretty much keeping up with the
modutils releases.
