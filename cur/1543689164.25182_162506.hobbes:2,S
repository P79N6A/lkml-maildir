Hi.
When booting 2.6.0-test4 with sisfb (630) and FB-console built-in,
it appears that I have no sfm defined by default.
consolechars -U generates an empty file.
This makes my braille display driver daemon very unhappy,
and all the characters on the screen are shown as question marks on my
braille display.
I found out that if I export the sfm of my 2.4.20 machine
and consolechars -u that file under 2.6.0-test4, BRLTTY
seems to be happy again.
Can anyone explain 
 1.: Is it a bug that upon boot with console fb, there is no default sfm?
 2.: If not, how can I convince the kernel to provide a default sfm, without
     having to load one from user-space?
P.S.: I am not subscribed, so please CC me.
