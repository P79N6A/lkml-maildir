  I get this repeatedly while running 2.5.44-mm6
bad: scheduling while atomic!
Call Trace:
 [<c011599b>] do_schedule+0x30b/0x310
 [<c013884b>] kswapd+0x11b/0x14e

 [<c010565d>] kernel_thread_helper+0x5/0x18
  My config file is attached.  At the time I was trying to copy a large
file (217M iso image) from one directory to another (from one reiserfs
partition to another ext3 partition, if that matters any).
