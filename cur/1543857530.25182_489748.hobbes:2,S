Subject: Loud POP from sound system during module init w/ 2.6.19

Since upgrading to 2.6.19, two of my boxes (one workstation, one
notebook) started making a very loud (and scary) POP from the sound
system when the alsa modules are loaded. Unloading and reloading the
modules will generate another pop.
I have removed any fiddling of mixer settings during module
load/unload; same results.
I have complied the kernel both with and without
CONFIG_SND_AC97_POWER_SAVE; same results.
The workstation uses snd_emu10k1, the notebook snd_intel8x0, so it's
affecting more than a single driver.
Anybody else seeing this behaviour and know how to stop it?
