B only ran for 15 cycles, and therefore it ISN'T the time-affinity process.
That's the whole point: if a process doesn't run for N cycles, it doesn't
get tied to the CPU. If B HAD run for >50 cycles, and been interrupted, then
its last_cpu would be 2.
I think a better way to do it would be to keep a per-CPU pointer to the last
task to run. That way, no more than one process "owns" a CPU. If we keep it
like this, then if A then B both run on CPU2 for >50 cycles, then both have
last_cpu of 2. Isn't there a cpu_struct somewhere where we could store a
last_task pointer?
