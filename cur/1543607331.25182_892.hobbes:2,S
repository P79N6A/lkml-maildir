You do not have to add RAID to need to worry about multiple parents. If we
want to correctly represent devices that have multiple paths (i.e twin
tailed SCSI, fibre channel, multi-ported devices, etc) we should have a
solution to handle this.  Some O/S's have moved to directed graphs to
address the multiple parent issue. Exposing only one block / character
device per real physical device would reduce O/S resources (major /
minors, structs) and provide a single request queue.
The current model of a scsi_device having a single parent and being
attached to the scsi_host host_queue has made adding multi-path support
to Linux below the SCSI lower level driver difficult.
