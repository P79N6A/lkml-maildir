Of course ISAPI is faster than CGI. The same happens with NSAPI. 
However, both are proprietary, have a steep learning curve, and 
usually, xSAPI extensions run on the same address space as the Web 
server, improving performance but decreasing stability. However, CGI 
runs as a separate process which adds a lot of overhead. There are 
solutions like FastCGI with less overhead and that allow persistence 
(the executable CGI is not destroyed, but stays in memory waiting for 
future requests).
MS commissioned studies are totally useless: they only probe what MS 
wants. If MS wants us to believe earth is flat, a MS commissioned study 
will reveal so.
