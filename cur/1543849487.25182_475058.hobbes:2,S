Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Real-time Linux users list created
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/20/170

	We have created a list for users of CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT,
linux-rt-users@vger.kernel.org.   It is archived on gmane.org (and of
course people who want to read it via gmane's NNTP or RSS feeds can do
so as well): 
	
http://gmane.org/info.php?group=gmane.linux.rt.user
Development discussions will continue on LKML, but this will allow
people interested in using CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT to have a forum to talk
about usage issues, tricks and tips, without needing to deal with the
huge volume of the LKML list.  And, of course, there is also the
real-time wiki, available at:
	
http://rt.wiki.kernel.org/
which will be focused at users as well as developers.
Regards,
						- Ted
