You can't solve this through bootmem because x86-64 allocates memory
in several places before bootmem (using functions in e820.c) Right now
this is quite hackish with hard coded areas to avoid conflicts.  But I
recently had a need to allocate more memory that early too and changed
the code to a generic early reservation interface. With that it would
be relatively easy to reserve.
