No, since it probably wont be "uped" by the same process.  So what you
want to do is change the definition of name from semaphore to
compat_semaphore, and keep it as init_MUTEX_LOCKED.  And please send
patches to Ingo (I've included him on CC).  Also include Ingo on all RT
related issues, since he is the one maintaining the patch.
Thanks,
