So you're saying that at most any given node is 4 hops away from any
other for your arch?

That's how we have our stuff coded at the moment, but with classzones you
might be able to get that down even further.  For instance, you could have
classzones that correspond to the number of hops a set of nodes is from a
given node.  Having such classzones might make finding nearby memory
easier.
