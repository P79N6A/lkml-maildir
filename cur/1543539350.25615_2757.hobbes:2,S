I've submitted a patch for this driver that no one really acknowledged.
You're allowed to set the sampling rate to zero through an ioctl, and when
that happens, it causes a divide by zero exception.
I find that other sound drivers interpret this as the application 
requesting the sampling rate,  which is why a perfectly innocent (if not 
naive) program of mine crashed on this driver.
Even if setting it to zero is NOT the way to get the sampling rate, I
don't think division by zero is a desired side-effect.
