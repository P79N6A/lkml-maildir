Channel dwell time for a passive scan is usually around 100ms - 250ms,
depending on how accurate you want your scan results (== wait longer),
and how much power you want to save (== don't wait long).
Correct userspace apps should:
1) Set a timer for, say, 8 seconds
2) Issue an SIWSCAN command
3) Wait for the GIWSCAN netlink event from the card, get results via
GIWSCAN command when it comes; cancel the timer from (2)
4) If the timer fires because no GIWSCAN event was received, try to get
scan results via GIWSCAN command from the driver anyway
<rant>
Note that NDIS requires a driver to return _something_ within 2 seconds
of a scan request.  Even if you're an 802.11a card (madwifi *cough*, I'm
starting a new thing where I cough after...).  So it's certainly
possible to return scan results in a timely manner, since the Windows
drivers for these cards are obviously doing it just fine.
Drivers should buffer scan results from past scans, age them
appropriately, and purge them when they get too old.  Drivers should
never, ever, clear the scan result list when SIWSCAN or GIWSCAN is
called, because that means there's a window when a scan result request
from some other app could illegitimately return no BSSID records.

Unless you're madwifi *cough* and then you may have to wait up to _14_
seconds for a full scan of all a/bg channels.  That's just insane.  I
have no idea why that's the case (or at least was up to earlier this
year) but it's just unacceptable.

Right.  It should 100% be in userspace and not in the drivers.  Who says
2 minutes is the right interval?  Putting that stuff, and the get/set
commands for changing that interval, in the driver is just plain wrong.
