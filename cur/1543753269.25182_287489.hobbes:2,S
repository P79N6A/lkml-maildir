I believe (and Karim can correct me if I'm wrong) the idea is to have
groups of events that can be disabled and enabled via a one word mask.  No
checking multiple variables, no #ifdefing, something very streamlined.  By
userspace I assume you mean post-processing, i.e., if the user/library/etc
needs to log events they use the same simple facility.
I think we agree to optimize/streamline performance for the gathering and
do work in the post processing.  There is an outstanding patch that makes
strides in this direction.
