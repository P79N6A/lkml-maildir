Could I get an historical (2.4 & Distribution) perspective on this. At
which point, or what code/include/manifest/version delineating it, would
you say the driver is no longer, if ever, required to place a lock
(host_lock or io_request_lock) around the scsi_done call?
I expect (or hope) the answer to be: always needs io_request_lock in
2.4, never needed the host_lock in 2.5+.
