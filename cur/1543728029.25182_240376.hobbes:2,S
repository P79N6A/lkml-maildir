No, last I looked was in 2.4, and it was a passing glance long ago.

This is a read lock that will become a write lock.  It allows other read 
locks; but blocks write locks and other read_to_write locks.  It is 
blocked by write locks [and other read_to_write locks](sorry).

What no, read that.  It blocks write locks and other read_to_write 
locks.  It should have the above ammendment that it blocks other 
read_to_write locks from beginning, although it is mentioned that this 
DOES block its own kind.  I guess I need to repete myself sometimes.
The point is to prevent operations that find an index on a linked list 
to insert/remove at from altering while something could be reading. 
Concurrent read locks can both find nearby indicies, then race for a 
write lock, leaving the first to clobber the second.
With this type of semaphore (am I using this word correctly?), any 
number of readlocks can exist concurrently with exactly one 
read_write_lock, but will block that read_write_lock from transforming 
to write mode.  Similarly, only one read_write_lock can actually be 
unblocked at any one time, to prevent these races.

I've seen bad things.
