OK, what I meant by faking some values is that a super-uid process should
be seen by others as a root process. This could be done by making some
simple system calls lie about them. And to my opinion, just a few system
calls would have to lie.
As for readability, comments are a good start, and since at my university
they are very strict about documenting every single detail, I could make
documentation available in linux/Documentation.

Well, I don't think that is exactly true. To make a file writable in
/proc, I have to implement a struct file_operations (witch has a write
method). In that method, I can personnaly check the uid of the current
process and return an appropriate error message.

Good question, in the write method, I can block interruptions, then do a
for_each_process(p) and change all the super-user's processes to the new
super-uid. Then, reable interrupts.

Good point, but it is possible to say that we put 500 possible roots.
Let's say from 500-1000. Normal users would use higher uids. And since the
root account shouldn't be used for regular uses, it wouldn't be a problem.
Root would only start daemons, and as it is today, all of the jobs he
started will be priviledged with the same advantages and disadvantages
they have today.

OK, I've been studying the sources for 8 mounths now. I feel that I know
what I'm doing. And I am aware that this can not be done in a few days,
but keep in mind that this project in meant to measure my knowladge of
computer sciences. It has to be relativly big anyways.

Also, I plan to give a user the option to compile this support or not to
compile it in the kernel. But this, couldn't be done as a module for
fairly obvious reasons. And I will do my best to make tha code as stable
and highly tested as possible.
				Thanks a lot for your feedback.
