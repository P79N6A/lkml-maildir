Thanks for your reply.
Below is the code that print the kernel calling trace:
/**********************************************************************************/
void show_trace(struct task_struct *task, unsigned long * stack)
{
	unsigned long ebp;
	if (!task)
		task = current;
	if (task == current) {
		/* Grab ebp right from our regs */
		asm ("movl %%ebp, %0" : "=r" (ebp) : );
	} else {
		/* ebp is the last reg pushed by switch_to */
		ebp = *(unsigned long *) task->thread.esp;
	}
	while (1) {
		struct thread_info *context;
		context = (struct thread_info *)
			((unsigned long)stack & (~(THREAD_SIZE - 1)));
		ebp = print_context_stack(context, stack, ebp);
		stack = (unsigned long*)context->previous_esp;
		if (!stack)
			break;
		printk(" =======================\n");
	}
}
/**********************************************************************************/
From this code, I can see that the show_trace does not scan and guess
the pointers. Instead, it use "previous_esp" to extract the esp and
thus the returning eip. Am I right?
Cheers,
