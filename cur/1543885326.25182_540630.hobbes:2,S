Hi Dan,

I started reviewing this patch yesterday. First thing I noticed was that
you seem to be moving some code from include/asm-arm/arch-iop13xx/system.h
to include/asm-arm/arch-iop13xx/iop13xx.h .
This should not be part of this patch since it is touching architecture
dependant code for which I do not have enough knowledge about this specific
architecture to tell if this is indeed the correct way to do this.
The maintainers of this architecture should imho comment on this.
Could you split this patch into 2 patches: one that deals with the moving of
the architecture dependant code (and explaining why) and one with the new
watchdog drivers? I will continue my review today.
Thanks,
Wim.
