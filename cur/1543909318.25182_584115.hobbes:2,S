I suppose you meant include/ here?

Likewise?
The more pressing question that comes to mind is what the point of this
is? Architecture related drivers and things of that nature fall under
this also, as most folks don't create a separate entry for every trivial
driver. Are you intending to have a long list of individual drivers here
that your script can parse?
Is there actually a problem with people just opening up MAINTAINERS in a
text file? Surely this is not such a non-intuitive thing, there are
already keywords there you can grep for.
