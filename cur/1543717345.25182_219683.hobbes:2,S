Let me say this one more time, since you keep changing the topic so you
can say that you don't care about something I never mentioned. I am
**NOT** talking about binary modules, I am **NOT** talking about out of
tree code, I am talking about applications which make calls that cause the
**IN TREE** code to use more than 4k.

Right, the kernel code does not contain any places where the data passed
in a system call isn't reflected in stack usage.

And what better way to detect it than to release it in a stable kernel.
Don't bother to say "don't use -mm" AKPM has said it is intended for the
stable kernel, work or not.

I still haven't seen any objective data showing that there is any
measureable benefit from this, although I agree that smaller is good
practice, I don't think that throwing in a feature in a stable kernel,
which has been reported by others to corrupt data, is the best way to do
it.
