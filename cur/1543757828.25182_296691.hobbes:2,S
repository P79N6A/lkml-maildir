Hi,
I wrote a kernel tool for my personnal usage which goal is to keep a
record of recent task preemptions and interruptions that appears under
linux. Either for debugging through KDB, or for monitoring/analyze
with a   graphics representation.
as adviced, SourceForge project is now opened:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kernelanalyzer/
Best regards,
Sylvain
