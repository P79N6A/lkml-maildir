It's not too bad and it's only for exported symbols:
[krh@dinky fw]$ grep EXPORT *.c | wc -l
27
and using the same prefix as the device_id struct will be nice.  When I 
submitted the ieee1394_device_id patch I originally proposed hpsb_device_id, 
but nobody knew what that meant so we went with the ieee1394_device_id we have 
now.  Oh, and net/ieee80211 uses ieee80211 as prefix, so it wont be the 
longest subsytem prefix :).  Plus I want to go throught the list of exported 
symbols, some of the names can be trimmed a bit.
Having said that, using drivers/firewire and the fw_ prefix, as Marcel 
suggests, works too.  It's what bluetooth and infiniband does, so there is 
some precedence there.

Oh, I don't know... for the longest time I didn't know what hpsb meant, and 
high performance serial bus is pretty generic sounding... are we talking about 
usb, sata, ieee1394 or rs232?  Ok, I guess rs232 is neither hp or b.  But 
seriously, except for the current stack, I've never seen the hpsb abbreviation 
used much.
