As I say - I prefer to keep moving in the forward direction.  So if a patch
needs coding-style cleanups, warning fixes, bugfixes, etc it's usually
quicker to just fix the thing immediately rather than send it back, wait
and then redo everything.  The submitter sees the fixes and hence will
Never Do That Again (right?)
None of this is a particular burden for me - it'd average an hour a day,
tops.  My main reason for the big whine is that this defect rate indicates
that people just aren't being sufficiently careful in their work.  If so
many silly trivial things are slipping through, then what does this tell us
about the big things, ie: runtime bugs?

There's plenty of time for that in the grave.
