This is doable, but it would require a bit of hacking to Majordomo.
Problem is, a lot* of people tend to post from addresses different from
their subscribe address. MJ1.9x (which vger uses) doesn't understand the
concept of subscribers having more than one address, but the alpha MJ2
does. It makes cross-posting challenging too, unless all the lists use the
same token.
At any rate, I'll be happy to write a patch if the list owners are
interested. I may even have time for it this evening.
