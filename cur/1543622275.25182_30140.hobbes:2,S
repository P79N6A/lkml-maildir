I wonder if anyone might look at doing the same sort of fix to
the 2.4.18 working tree?  I experience the same sort of behavior
with usb-uhci on my KT266A board (VT82C586B USB) on 2.4.18-rc1 (and
previous 2.4.x kernels, too).  I'd do it myself, but the patch from
Patrick on inode.c makes me too nervous to do it, since I have
no experience with the filesystem drivers.
Thanks,
