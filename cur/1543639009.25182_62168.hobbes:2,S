I've finally tracked this down (at least partially). It's something to do
with the sound drivers... If I disable the sound system it all works fine.
The sound options I was using were probably a bit weird as I wasn't sure
what I needed.
I've tried removing individual options from the sound section to try and
narrow this down but they all the options seem to be interdependent.
For reference the sound system was moved from /drivers/sound to /sound in
2.5.5 which is where the kernels stopped working from.
