I wrote a bad boot disk recently, then I write; sync; cmp until 
floppy image matched source, a user can do that if they care... 
Related: observed that a USB CompactFlash adapter under windows, 
the device light goes out when unmounted, but under linux the 
light stays on after umount, this seems bad from usability perspective.  
It leaves me with a little distrust of linux' handling of non-locked 
removable media (as opposed to lockable media like a zipdisk or cdrom).
