Subject: [PATCH] [GFS2] Make the log reserved blocks depend on block size
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/9/250

From: Steven Whitehouse <swhiteho@redhat.com>
The number of blocks which we reserve in the log at the start of each
transaction needs to depends upon the block size since the overhead is
related to the number of "pointers" which can be fitted into a single
block.
This relates to Red Hat bz #240435
