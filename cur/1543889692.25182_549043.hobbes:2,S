Sorry, but IMHO every observations are only kind of illusions,
and should have no influence on any serious science, including
computer science.
But, from smpboot.c history:
"[PATCH] i386: Clean up smp_tune_scheduling()
Adrian Bunk [Thu, 7 Dec 2006 01:14:19 +0000 (02:14 +0100)]
- remove the write-only local variable "bandwidth"
- don't set "max_cache_size" in the (cachesize < 0) case:
  that's already handled in kernel/sched.c:measure_migration_cost()"
So, it seems such strange phenomenon could've been observed
long time ago...
Thanks,
Jarek P.
