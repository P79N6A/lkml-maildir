The only thing I got back from IBM was:
       Please be advised, that the e-mail forum you
       have reached is provided for non-technical
       support and web registration issues of IBM.
       ave reached is provided for non-technical
       Please send your research proposal to IBM at
       T.J Watson Research Center at 914-945-3167.
I don't think I'm l33t enough like to call there and discuss for what we 
are looking for. Also they will probably tell me, " Ahh, well we 
currenly don't want to release anything because of legal issue" (Like I 
was already told)
