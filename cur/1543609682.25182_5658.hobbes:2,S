We end up copying data around a lot more with the 4 or 64Gb kernels. Some of
this unneccessarily. It may be down to your workload it might be a vm
quirk. Do the boxes all run the same workload.
Jens Axboe has patches for some setups that basically kill the slowdown
for all cases providing your I/O controller is sane
