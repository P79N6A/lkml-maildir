I want the automount mount points to be visible even if they are not 
mounted.
It seems the "ghost" option implements that. I can find several 
references on the internet which indicates it is available, like:
http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Auto_mount_filesystems_
(AUTOFS)
Nevertheless, on some recent distributions I have tested on, this option 
is not available.
Can anyone tell me in which version of automount it is present?
Or is it a distribution specific patch?
Thanks!
Olivier
