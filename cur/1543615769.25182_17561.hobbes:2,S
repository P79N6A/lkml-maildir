compatibility glue.  And of all of the things you listed above, they
should all work independantly of eachother too, for the most part.

But why do we need yet another tree for this?  There already is a large
set of users testing the preemption patches, and I'm not aware of any
new filesystems yet, but I don't see why they'd need another tree
either.  A lot of what the -ac tree did was provide maintainers another
person to give their patches to (since sending stuff to Linus is a hit
or miss thing for many people) that tended to have a high rate of
success (or comments) with Linus.  Marcelo is very good about taking
patches from maintainers (and telling other people to send stuff to said
maintainer first).

Again I say, why do we need a 'test' tree?  I really don't see more than
one large patch/project/feature getting into a final release, so testing
that project with a bunch of other projects actually invalidates the
testing of it.

I'd really rather not just yet.  I'm pretty sure this is all on-topic
still.
