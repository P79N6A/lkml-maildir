    I was doing exactly that, but it has its drawbacks: root still
can create files by accident. I've been hit by this a couple of
times :( For example, as root, I issue the mount command with a typo,
and before I can read the result of the command I've already typed a
'cp' or 'mv' command, 'sync' and 'umount'. Yes, I know, I should read
carefully what I type as root and the result of the commands, and I
do except when issuing harmless commands as 'cp' O:))) My fault, yes,
but it can be solved easily with the trick provided by Dean ;)
