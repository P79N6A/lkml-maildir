   That's more complicated.
Hmm, we put arbitrary tables of information into seperate elf sections
already.  Consider the exception fixup mechanism for example.  That's
the kind of thing I was thinking about.
Oh I see, you're saying that then getting at the things symbolically
will be painful.  Yes it needs more thought.
   If you want to omit the per-cpu area from the kernel image, then
   arrange for it to be .bss.
   
Good idea, well on SMP it can be marked throw-away (ie. __init_data).
