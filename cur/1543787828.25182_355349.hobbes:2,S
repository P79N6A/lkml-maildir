I'm not convinced - release_resource() isn't like kfree() - it's more
like device_unregister().
It makes sense for kfree() to ignore NULL pointers, but does it really
make sense for *_unregister() to do so too?  Surely you want to only
unregister things which you know have previously been registered?
