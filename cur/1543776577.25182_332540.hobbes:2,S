yeah. In the '500 fds select' benchmark workload do_select() does an 
extremely tight loop over a 500-entry table that does an fget(). fget() 
acquires/releases current->files->file_lock. So we get 1000 lock and 
unlock operations in this workload. It cannot be for free. In fact, look 
at how the various vanilla kernels compare:
    AVG           v2.6.12        v2.6.12-PREEMPT        v2.6.12-SMP         
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
       select:      11.48           12.35 (  7%)       26.40 (129%)
(tested on one of my single-processor testsystems.)
I.e. SMP locking is already 129% overhead, and CONFIG_PREEMPT (which 
just bumps the preempt count twice(!)) has 7% overhead. In that sense, 
the 27% select-500-fds overhead measured for PREEMPT_RT is more than 
acceptable.
anyway, these days apps that do select() over 500 fds are expected to 
perform bad no matter what locking method is used. [To fix this
particular overhead we could take the current->file_lock outside of the
loop and do a get_file() within do_select(). This would improve SMP too.
But i doubt anyone cares.]
