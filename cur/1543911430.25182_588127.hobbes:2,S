For less-than-briliant people like me, it's totally non-obvious that
cpu_relax() is needed for correctness here, not just to make P4 happy.
IOW: "atomic_read" name quite unambiguously means "I will read
this variable from main memory". Which is not true and creates
potential for confusion and bugs.
