Good news, no new branch needed to track. 
I assume the problem is still like _TMP & (_PSV | _AC0).
How about re-testing dummy _PSV and dummy _AC0 in DSDT?
Because, your testing result with dummy _PSV and dummy_AC0
IS NOT consistent with the result of hacking
acpi_thermal_passive/active.
Maybe I need to reconsider the impact of _PSV or_AC0 on the 
platform.
How about  just faking _TMP in DSDT. I'm sure you have done this before.
But, I need to confirm that the problem is NOT _TMP | _PSV | _AC0.
Thanks,
Luming
