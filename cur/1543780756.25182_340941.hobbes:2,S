Oh. You are talking about CacheFS? That hasn't been declared "ready to
merge" yet.
That said, is it really safe to use any flags other than
PG_lock/PG_writeback there, David? I can't see that you want to allow
other tasks to modify or free the page while you are writing it to the
local cache.
Cheers,
