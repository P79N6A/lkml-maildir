We need to understand that right now, 2.6.x is 2.7-pre.  Once 2.7 forks off
we are more at liberty to merge nasty highmem hacks which will die when 2.6
is end-of-lined.
I plan to merge the 4g split immediately after 2.7 forks.  I wouldn't be
averse to objrmap for file-backed mappings either - I agree that the search
problems which were demonstrated are unlikely to bite in real life.
But first someone would need to demonstrate that pte_chains+4g/4g are
for some reason unacceptable for some real-world setup.
Apart from the search problem, my main gripe with objrmap is that it
creates different handling for file-backed and anonymous memory.  And the
code which extends it to anonymous memory is complex and large.  One ends
up needing to seriously ask oneself what is being gained from it all.

Sure, let's see what it looks like.  Even if it is nearly two years late.
Oh, and can we please have testcases?  It's all very well to assert "it
sucks doing X and I fixed it" but it's a lot more useful if one can
distrubute testcases as well so others can evaluate the fix and can explore
alternative solutions.
Andrea, this shmem problem is a case in point, please.

Case in point.  We went round the O(1) page reclaim loop a year ago and I
was never able to obtain a testcase which demonstrated the problem on 2.4,
let alone on 2.6.
I had previously found some workloads in which the 2.4 VM collapsed for
similar reasons and those were fixed with the rotate_reclaimable_page()
logic.  Without testcases we will not be able to verify that anything else
needs doing.

Did they have a testcase?

Current 2.6 will write out nr_inactive>>DEF_PRIORITY pages, will then
throttle behind I/O and then will start reclaiming clean pages from the
tail of the LRU which were moved there at interrupt time.

Maybe not.  Testcase, please ;)

Did I mention testcases?
