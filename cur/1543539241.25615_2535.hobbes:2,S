ok, that is much better and clearer. I see files_struct->count field so I
 assume the same idea as for p->mm and p->fs applies (assuming
p->alloc_lock is guarding p->files as well, which is confirmed by the
comment in task_struct).

Thanks, I will redo the patch with all the above in mind. Tomorrow I will
be thinking about heavier issues you discovered.
