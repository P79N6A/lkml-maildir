Howdy,
  This may be off-topic, but recently I upgraded a RH5.2 box, to 6.0.  
I do not have a clue what could have transpired, but after the upgrade I
could not see 3 drives.   Two are IDE drives, and the other is an IBM
4gig scsi drive.  The controllers acknowledge them but fdisk will not. 
They worked find until I upgraded.   [BTW, the point of the upgrade was
to install a bigger root partition, and add more general drive space]. 
Here is some info:
The SCSI Disk:
<snip>
[menion@linux /proc/scsi]$ cat scsi
Attached devices:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: OEM      Model: DCRS04Z          Rev: 0101
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 01 Lun: 00
  Vendor: SONY     Model: CD-ROM CDU-76S   Rev: 1.1c
  Type:   CD-ROM                           ANSI SCSI revision: 02
[menion@linux /proc/scsi]$ fdisk /dev/sda
Unable to open /dev/sda
[menion@linux /proc/scsi]$

I can provide more info, if someone would care to help me.
thanks.

p.s. I have tried a variety of settings, and different features...  I
have also tried different kernel version.  Is is possbile that somehow
all three are actually damaged, and the OS thinks that they are fine. -
At least until it tries to use them?
