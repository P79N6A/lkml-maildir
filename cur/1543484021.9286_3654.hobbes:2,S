Hi,
(System: intel Linux 2.0.36 (SuSE 6.0), glibc2.0.7)
what do I have to do to work with a device at /dev/ttyS1 that has no RTS
and CTS line - I can send commands out but I can't receive anything,
which flags do I have to send to tcsetattr() to make the kernel able to
receive signs...? (I've tried: raw mode transfer, O_SYNC, c_iflag = IXON
and IXANY -- none worked)
