Subject: [PATCH 1/2] change io_cancel return code for no cancel case
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Wendy Cheng <wcheng@redhat.com>
Note that other than few exceptions, most of the current filesystem and/or
drivers do not have aio cancel specifically defined (kiob->ki_cancel field
is mostly NULL).  However, sys_io_cancel system call universally sets
return code to -EAGAIN.  This gives applications a wrong impression that
this call is implemented but just never works.  We have customer inquires
about this issue.
Changed by Benjamin LaHaise to EINVAL instead of ENOSYS
