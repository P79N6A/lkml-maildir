Thanks for this link. It isn't no more necessary to patch anything since i've 
reduced the number of groups per uid to the limit. Well, i'd been reading the 
sunRPC rfc before, bringing a lot of trouble to me. 
The main problem was that users in the seventeenth (or higher) group (they 
should not have any permissions for this group because of NFS_MAXGROUPS) were 
able to change without permissions into those directories. I think a user or 
group should have permission or NOT, and not a "bit of permissions".
