Subject: [VERY TRIVIAL] patch for 2.6.5 to cleanup missing newlines at end of files
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/4/23/202

As we all know, source files should end in newlines, and indeed almost all
files in the 2.6.5 source do, but I found one that does not
(linux-2.6.5/drivers/tc/lk201.h), so here's a patch to fix that.
While I was at it I checked all the files, and a few documentation files
also did not end in newline, so I desided to add one to those as well.
Why bother? Well, gcc will complain with "warning: no newline at end of
file" for the source files, and there's really no need to get that
warning. For the documentation files it is nice to have the file end on a
newline when you cat it or otherwise pass it through some tool that works
on a line by line basis.
Very trivial stuff indeed...
Here's the patch - generated with  diff -ur  against 2.6.5
As it makes no functional changes at all, kills a warning and makes a few
text file more cat/grep/<whatever> friendly I see no reason not to include
it.
