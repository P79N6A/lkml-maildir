This patch looks very redundant.
If you have CONFIG_SMP defined then atomic_dec_and_lock will never get
defined, and if CONFIG_HAVE_DEC_LOCK is not defined, then
dec_and_lock.c will never even get compiled. Even the config.h include
is superfluous as linux/module.h will include it.
I don't understand though: I have no problems compiling and linking
stock 2.4.10 with CONFIG_M386=y + CONFIG_SMP=y.
Are you sure that you didn't miss a 'make dep' after doing 'make
config'/'make oldconfig'?
Cheers,
