Right.  I'm not using it yet in unionfs, although I could; for now I'm just
calling very similar code myself.  This is only used in unionfs after I
process my own ioctls; IOW, I pass all unknown ioctls to the lower level and
let it handle it.
eCryptfs, however, doesn't pass unknown ioctls to the lower layer: it only
processes its own.
Honestly I'm not sure which is more appropriate: should a stackable f/s pass
unknown ioctls to the lower f/s or not?  If it doesn't, would any important
functionality be lost?
Erez.
