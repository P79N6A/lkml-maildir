I think that's best.  It's a bit user-unfriendly, but a silent fallback is
misleading.
It might be acceptable to print a warning, then fall back.

solaris directio(DIRECTIO_ON) is a hint only.  If the system cannot perform
the uncached zerocopy then it will fall back to buffered IO.  Solaris will
perform direct-IO "when the application's buffer is aligned on a two-byte
(short) boundary, the offset into the file is on a device sector boundary,
and the size of the operation is a multiple of device sectors."
On Linux you set direct-io with open(O_DIRECT) or fcntl(F_SETFL, O_DIRECT).
If the filesystem doesn't support direct-io we will fail the open/fcntl
attempt up-front in 2.6 only.
If O_DIRECT was successfully set and the IO is not correctly aligned Linux
will fail the relevant I/O attempt.  Alignment requirements are:
2.4: page aligned on-disk and in-memory
2.6: device sector aligned on-disk and in-memory.
I'd recomment that dd use getpagesize() alignment on-disk and in-memory.
