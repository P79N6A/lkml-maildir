You're right. I understand now. I just  changed a dial on my tests,
ran it and found pdflush not keeping up like it should. I need to
address this.

I am getting where you are coming from. But if we are going to make
changes to optimize for seeks maybe we need to be more aggressive in
write back in how we organize both time and location. Right now AFAIK
there is no attention to location in the writeback path.

Could you expand that to say it's not the inodes of large files but
the ones with data that we can exploit locality? Often large files are
fragmented. Would it make more sense to pursue cracking the inodes and
grouping their blocks's locations? Or is this all overkill and should
be handled at a lower level like the elevator?

I completely agree.
