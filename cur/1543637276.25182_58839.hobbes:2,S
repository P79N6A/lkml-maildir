Hi,
USB keyboards don't work with recent 2.4.19-preXX (-pre2 works fine for
me, but pre-10 and up don't), as well as int (at least) 2.5.25.
The kernel does find the keyboard during bootup, but doesn't accept any
keypresses. This happens regardless of the UHCI driver selected in
2.4.19 (normal or JE). 
Input core support has been compiled in, as well as the full HID.
Verified on one different machine.
Regs,
Sven
