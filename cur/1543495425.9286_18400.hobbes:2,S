Using Cyctest, a diagnostics software from Cyclades.
In NT, it was tested using the NT driver.
Interestingly enough, the NT Diagnostics indicates that the _same_
resource Linux tries to allocate (i.e., f9e00000-f9efffff) are being
allocated by NT, just in the right way.
Anyway, I'll talk to PLX again. However, I think Linux has something to do
with it. Of course I might be wrong ...
