I never actually saw it work until I added the noapic option to the 
2.6.11.2 boot.  Now I can usually my USB mouse!  Of course the downside 
to specifying noapic is only one CPU is servicing interrupts on my SMP 
system.
It certainly doesn't work under 2.4.28, but I haven't tried specifying 
noapic to that kernel.  Would that be useful information?
