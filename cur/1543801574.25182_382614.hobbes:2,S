As Michael already said -- there's no real reason for that. We were just
brainstorming. The /dev idea seemed like a good plan at first, but then
it isn't fixed. What you suggested below does look useful too.
Coming back to the point Michael already raised: the overarching idea is
to get rid of the net_dev for the 'master' device, even if the
underlying hardware supports only a single virtual device (which might
then be created by the driver automatically)
I'll move the wiki pages a bit to accomodate different models, please
check in a few minutes.
