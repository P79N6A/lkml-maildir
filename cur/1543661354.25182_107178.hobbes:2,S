Unfortunately, this is on a production server, and such a drastic
change to the configuration is not really possible at the moment.
However, I have gone ahead and sent them this info.  We will see.
I'm already on the serial console option.  Hope to have it soon.
I saw a lot of TCP-related symbols.  Is there any chance that this is
a bug in the bcm5700 module?  Or in the TCP stack?
