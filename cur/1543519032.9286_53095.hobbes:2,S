Hi,
    During the compilation of linux v2.2.13 using gcc 2.95.2 and libc v2.0.7pre6
,I noticed that the kernel configuration option in the "Configure.help" for
UNIX 98 ptys require glibc v2.1. However, the /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes
 says that the minimum libc is libc6 v2.0.7pre6 and makes no mention of
any new glibc 2.1.x.
QUESTION: Is there currently any kernel requirement in version 2.2.1 thru
2.2.13 or higher that *really* requires glibc v2.1.x or newer besides
UNIX 98 pty's?
Since it is really easy for one to miss the explicity glibc v2.1 requirement
for Unix 98 pty's, perhaps all the documentation should be change to just
make this the minimum requirement now.
COMMENT: Presently, I'm trying to run linux kernels 2.2.7 and above to 2.2.13
and am running into race conditions in the boot sequence when using libc6
v2.0.7pre6 with the "do_select()" function when no SMP support is selected.
When SMP *is* selected it crashes also, but there is no stack trace.
