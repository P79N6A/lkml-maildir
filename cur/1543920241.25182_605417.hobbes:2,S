I'm not sure I really get what the difference is, but I don't feel
strongly one way or the other.  I can make that change.

If you have an update, send it along and I will rebase.

That was a leftover from before we had the double_lock inside the search
function.  I will clean this up.

Well, only that it has a few efficiency related advantages (1) to doing
this check before the activate() call.  You are correct that either
place would yield correct behavior.
(1) -> We can save the overhead of an unnecessary activate/deactivate
cycle, and avoid placing the system (even if only briefly) into overload
which will potentially affect other CPUs if they happen to call
_schedule() during the window.
