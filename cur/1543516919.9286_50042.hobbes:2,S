Also speaking of that, what about systems that actually put pci devices on
irq 16+?  I've seen some (NT hated it, linux didn't care <eg>  It was a
supermicro dual ppro) board do it like the one I just meantioned.  I believe
some tyan boards (like the one I have, but mine doesn't allocate higher than
15) do it as well.
I wasn't aware that some pci devices don't like sharing IRQs.  I didn't
think it mattered.
