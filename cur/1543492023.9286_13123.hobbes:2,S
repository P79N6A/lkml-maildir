Subject: Bug? ISDN stops working with 2.2.5ac2

Hello everyone.
This has been bugging me for a couple of days and as I can't figure it
out myself and post a patch, I ask for your help.
Something between 2.2.5 and 2.2.5ac2 stops ISDN syncPPP connections from
working correctly.
Here is a log transcript of a session with 2.2.5 (a few bits of
information have been masked with the letter 'X' for privacy/paranoia
reasons) where everything works as expected:

The YYY.YYY.YYY.YYY part in the above transcript is the IP network of my
provider. It is correct, as are the negotiated IP addresses, which leads
me to believe that there is nothing wrong with the PPP negotiation.
Even if I run "ifconfig ippp0 up" and set up the routes manually, no
data is transferred via the interface (/proc/net/dev shows no change in
packet counts).
A description of my settings:
- ELSA QuickStep 1000-pro PCI ISDN card
- isdn4k-utils 3.0b2 from ftp.franken.de
- ipppd from the above package, configured with:
/dev/ippp0
defaultroute
lock
noipdefault
noccp
debug
-chap
-proxyarp
mtu 576
mru 576
The only thing changing between the tests is the kernel version. The
kernels have been configured with the same options. The ipppd settings
have worked for me with 2.0.3[5-6] and 2.2.[1-5] but with ac2 they stop
working. I have not had the time to test ac1 yet and probably will not
until later this week.
