    I just upgraded a server from 2.0.36 to 2.2.3.  While attempting to fix
the pppd configuration file so that they worked with pppd 2.3.5 I came
across some really wierd behavior.    At first I had thought that I had
gotten PPPD working correctly again but they when I tried telneting from the
dialin system to the PPP server I noticed that telnet didn't connect.  I
booted a Linux PPP client system and tried again, same problem; depite the
ppp0 network devices being listed under ifconfig as well as the related
routes.  Then I tried telneting from the PPP server to the PPP client
machine and notice a very interesting thing.  Instead of connecting to the
client the telnet connection connected to the PPP server itself!!!  No
routes were setup manually and the IPs were automatically assigned by the
PPP server.  I then downed ppp0, ppp1, ppp2 with ifconfig (if I remember
correctly ppp1 and ppp2 also downed despite not being active anymore, they
had been before) and tried to delete any routes that may exist to what was
suppose to be the PPP client IP address, none existed.  Then I try the
telnet again, again it telneted back to the server; the PPP connection
wasn't even up anymore.  I checked arp, rarp, /etc/hosts, and anywhere else
that I could think of.  Nothing but something really wierd could have caused
this.  Finally I decided to reboot the machine.  After the reboot and new
pppd configuration files, built from scratch, the behavior didn't return.
The funcky behavior was actually solved by the reboot itself, although it
took new config files to get PPP working correctly.
