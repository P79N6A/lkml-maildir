Notice that this whole menu is for "Host-side USB", except for that
gadget stuff.  That might usefully be labeled as "Peripheral-side USB".
For that matter, it could be moved up a level in the menu, so the top
level driver menu has two USB entries:  Host side, and Peripheral side.
The driver stacks are independent of each other, except for common data
structures like what's in the <linux/usb/ch9.h> header file.  I think
there's no real point, other than history, to having both sides share
the same menu.
