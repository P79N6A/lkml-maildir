An interrupt went walkies. That in itself isnt a fatal event. I've seen
that from various boxes. Sometimes it shows up because an I/O was in
progress when the bios decided to suspend on us.

If you get disk corruption on a read only disk I think it has to be BIOS
side problems. On r/w you shouldnt. (Known exceptions - casio fiva 'lets
come back with the disk in a different configuration and suprise
everyone' and some ibm thinkpads with 20GB 2.5" disks - which
mysteriously goes away if you change disk and was also reported in
windows by some users)
Basically the OB500 is 'WONTFIX' or closer to 'CANTFIX'. I think you'll
need someone with HP BIOS source to pin it down even if the bug turns
out to be in the kernel code.
