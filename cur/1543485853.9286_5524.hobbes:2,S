What???  Can somebody qoute a line or two from the last week
discussions which would touch the language topic at all.  I cannot
recall any.  This would cause a massive breakage.  Can you spell
"a boot floppy"?  Apparently not.  Talking about "a result of a
discussion" and "in consideration of all involved" sounds to me
really disingenuous.
Also on small systems this would mean a choice between a monolithic
kernel, statically linked modutils (memory footprint) or non-optional
now C++ shared libraries (significant memory footprint as well).
This may be significant or at least PITA.  Big sigh!
Sounds like a call for a new modutils maintainer was not without
a merit.  Maybe a "sane modutils" branch should be forked?
After all the current modutils are written in C and switching the
language and ironing out bugs from programs and/or libraries on
all platforms will take some time.
