A related issue that's bugged me for a long time is lack of userspace
access to the quantity that's called 'freq_scale' in 2.4, where it's
(1<<SHIFT_HZ)/HZ for HZ!=100 and 128/128.125 for HZ==100.  (I haven't
started to reverse-engineer the equivalent value in 2.6, I took a quick
look once and concluded things had got a little more hairy.)
My interest is that I maintain (in spare-time) an NTP application called
chrony (
http://chrony.sunsite.dk/
), originally written to be good for
dial-up, i.e. NTP servers accessible for a short window once or twice a
day.  This app wants to tune the parameters it passes to adjtimex() to
take a best shot at keeping the system clock correct over the
potentially 'long' offline period.  To do this well, it has to
reverse-compensate for the freq_scale multiplier that the kernel will
apply to the frequency value passed to adjtimex().  Getting the right
value for this across different kernels has always been a fragile
exercise.
