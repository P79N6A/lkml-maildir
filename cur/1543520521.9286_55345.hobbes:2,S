I have to use framebuffer support to get X to work on my Laptop (ATI Rage mobility
P video card) which is capable of resolutions higher than 1280x1024.  However, the
framebuffer docs that I found in my kernel source distribution only provide
configuration options up to 1280x1024.  Is it possible to get framebuffer support
to use 1600x1200?
