In telecom at least, as long as the service which you are providing is 
available, you're "up".  The assumption is that you're "always" up, with brief 
(hopefully) interruptions for faults or upgrades.
Because of this, it may turn out that measuring service downtime is more 
meaningful than system uptime.
