That's quite obvious and the whole thread is all about just that.

What _is_ a "troublesome ABI definition" and who would qualify it
as such?

Who would do that?

Who would watch that? How do you differentiate between a user API/ABI
and an internal kernel API, if you don't know the code in question
at all?

How can we find that? Compiling the Fedora Code 7 would not be enough.

Why not? Kernel "private" headers can and must include ABI headers
as the private .c files do.
This won't work. include/user won't work either. There can't be any
"transition periods" nor "instant switchovers".
I can see only one way to solve the problem - gradually, without
"transition periods" etc.
1. We leave existing include/linux and include/asm (and possibly
   asm-generic etc) in place.
2. A new directory(ies) such as include/kernel (internal kernel headers)
   is created.
3. Code authors, who (I hope) know their code move the things they
   know are kernel-internal to the new directory(ies).
4. Userspace is explicitly forbidden to include anything in the new
   directory. We can even use some #ifndef __KERNEL__ #error user
   breakage as a tip.
In a year or two we can probably begin hunting remnants of the
internals in include/linux and include/asm.
We can now consider anything in include/{linux,asm} which prevents
userspace compilation etc. a bug. But bugs must be fixed by people
who know how to fix them correctly.
