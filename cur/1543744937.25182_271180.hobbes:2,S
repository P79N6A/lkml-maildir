Thanks, that was silly.
Anybody want to write a script that verifies that the only remaining 
"asmlinkage" entries are of the type "sys_xxxx()"? 
"grep" shows that there's a number of incorrect ones left, but most of 
them seem to take no arguments, so ir doesn't matter. And there's the FP 
emulation stuff, which really -does- use the old interfaces.
