Maybe I didn't express myself clearly. I thought his (or someone's)
point was the cost of goodness() calculations dominated, the
implication being that reducing the cost of goodness() would speed
things up a lot. While true, the cost of scanning the task structures
is also high. But in essence, I agree with Phil.
Someone else suggested that the cost was in all those context
switches, which I dispute. Switching state is relatively cheap. And
this was my point (and as you say, Phil's too).
