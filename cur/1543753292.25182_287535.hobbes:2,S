Hi,

An additional comment about the order of events. What you're doing in 
lockless_reserve is bogus anyway. There is no single correct time to 
write into the event. By artificially synchronizing event order and event 
time you only cheat yourself. You either take it into account during 
postprocessing that events can be interrupted or the time stamp doesn't 
seem to be that important, but there is nothing you can do during the 
recording of the event except of completely disabling interrupts.
bye, Roman
