first stage == page still not uptodate. second stage == page is already
uptodate and if it reverts to not-uptade state - it's a bug. Why? Because
then all nice logics about "no read requests for mapped pages" goes to
hell. We have such bug, BTW (in generic_file_write()).

Except that the only reason why check for page being uptodate is correct
is that for such pages we are guaranteed that buffer ring will not be
dropped when page contatins data newer than on disk.
Yes, it works. But I'ld really prefer to avoid these extra reads at all -
if the rule is that buffer is read only once during the whole life of
page the life becomes somewhat easier to explain.
Currently (even with the fixes discussed) we _do_ reread them. Yes, it's
harmless (see above).

Yes. In block_read_full_page(), for one thing. <looking> Oops. Sorry, I
didn't mark it.
