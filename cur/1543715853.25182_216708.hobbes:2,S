Ah. Of course. Humble apologies.

Could do. And on the top of merging, sorry for the delays I'm getting  
there. I figured out yesterday what was holding me back with getting SMP &  
HighMem going under 2.6. It was really simple: the compile was using -O2.  
A quick change to the Makefile and I can now use a C file as I do with 2.4.
Regards,
Nigel
