Linus' reasoning is actually outdated - on most modern x86s it is not
slower than the expanded code sequence because it will generate the
same number of macro/u-ops. But it would be still extremly ugly to 
implement, which is a good reason not to.

Yes, but it's only 128 bytes so it won't help for larger frames.
It will also work if you preextended the stack before, but i wouldn't
rely on it.
