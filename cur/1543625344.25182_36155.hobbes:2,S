Whatever's wrong with our BIOS is not the focus of the patch.
There are two sides to this, and the Linux side is that the
IO-operations to port 20 are completely superfluous on modern CPUs.

There is no point in keeping the timer_ack variable in the kernel's
symbol table if it's compiled for CPUS with TSC only, and no need
to test it in every timer interrupt if we know it's going to be 0
anyway.
Please note that do_slow_timeoffset is completely #ifdef'ed out in
time.c for CPUs with TSC.
