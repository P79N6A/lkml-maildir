This is unbelievable ugly. Can't you just save the packet as a binary
buffer, output it as binary in /proc and parse and format it in user space ?
Better would be to not use bootpc at all in kernel, but run it in initrd
(that is the long term plan anyways, removing dhcp/bootp completely
and only supporting them from initrd)
