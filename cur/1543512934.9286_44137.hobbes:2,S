I don't think he means 'optimizing' in the general sense. The early
gas compiled what was written. However, many bugs were not found
because gcc (which makes gas-asm as an intermediate step) didn't
generally generate bad code.
Since a lot of code got optimized into inline 'asm' macros to improve
performance, there were some bugs in that and gas didn't pick them
up.
