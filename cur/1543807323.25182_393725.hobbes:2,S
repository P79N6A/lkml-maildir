Hi,
It seems rotate_reclaimable_page fails most of the
time due the page not being on the LRU when kswapd
calls writepage().  The filesystem in my tests is
ext3.  The attached patch against 2.6.16-rc2 moves the
page to the LRU before calling writepage().  Below are
results for a write test with:
dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=1024k count=1024
To trigger the writeback path with the default dirty
ratios, I set swappiness to 55 and mapped memory to
about 80%.
w/o patch (/proc/sys/vm/wb_put_lru = 0):
pgrotcalls              25852
pgrotnonlru             25834
pgrotated               18
with patch (/proc/sys/vm/wb_put_lru = 1):
pgrotcalls              26616
pgrotated               26616
Thanks,
Shantanu
