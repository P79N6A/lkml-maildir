Yes, I just realized that.  It needs to be done after skip_for_load has 
been finalized.

Why?  It's already initialized.  If the current running task has 
prio==busiest_best_prio then we know that can_migrate_task() will 
prevent it from being moved so it's safe to move any other tasks we meet 
with that priority.

No we don't.  Once we've skipped one it's OK to move any others that we 
find.  We'll never move more than one as a result of overriding the skip 
anyhow .

But you initialized it to zero.
