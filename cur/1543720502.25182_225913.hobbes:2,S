Subject: [ANNOUNCE] udev 026 release
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/7/258

I've released the 026 version of udev.  It can be found at:
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-026.tar.gz
(yes, there was a 025 release, I just forgot to announce it, full
 changelog is below)
udev allows users to have a dynamic /dev and provides the ability to
have persistent device names.  It uses sysfs and /sbin/hotplug and runs
entirely in userspace.  It requires a 2.6 kernel with CONFIG_HOTPLUG
enabled to run.  Please see the udev FAQ for any questions about it:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
For any udev vs devfs questions anyone might have, please see:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs
Major changes since 024:
	- lots of minor bugfixes
	- added udev_volume_id from Kay Sievers which is an excellent
	  way to read block volume ids to create udev rules.
	- deleted the dbus and selinux programs as they were not the way
	  to integrate udev with those packages.  DBUS integration
	  with udev is now handled by the HAL project using the
	  /etc/dev.d/ notifiers.
	- update documentation.  Thanks to Daniel Drake for this.
Thanks to everyone who has send me patches for this release, a full list
of everyone, and their changes is below.
udev development is done in a BitKeeper repository located at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/udev
Daily snapshots of udev from the BitKeeper tree can be found at:

If anyone ever wants a tarball of the current bk tree, just email me.
thanks,
