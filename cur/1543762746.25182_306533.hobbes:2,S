Fair enough.  I just wanted to float this possibility.  I appreciate
your comments.  The original intention for this design was to begin
working on a framework for driver layering.  (ex. snd-intel8x0m -> ac97,
or the pci express bus abstraction)  I was considering the possibility
of having driver devices with parent and child relationships that
reflect the internal layering of Linux drivers.  I haven't really had a
chance to fully develop this idea, so at this point, driver layering and
my original email are just abstract concepts.
