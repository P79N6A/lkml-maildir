As far as I remember I didn't try the beta BIOS, the latest stable one
fixed my problems with the Sound Blaster and the floppy drive. I only
used the board with 2.4 (last kernel I ran was 2.4.20-rmap15i) and that
worked OK. If that still doesn't solve your problem, I agree the BIOS
has to be blacklisted so we can work around it.
