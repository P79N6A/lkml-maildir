WOW, that is the first compliment I have ever heard about my work from
another storage expert.  Doug if I could have a minute to make a
suggestion about the ./drivers/scsi/, would you concider making sg.c into
the core transport layer for the subsystem?  This would be similar to what
I am doing in ./drivers/ide with ide-taskfile.c.  Where as mine intial
migration will cover all "ATA" commands, but there are ZERO real state
machine engines for ATAPI.  I have considered and still looking at the
scope of pkt-taskfile.c as a generic transport layer for all atapi but
mating all the various standards into one is ugly.  I would prefer to
provide an ASPI layer between ATA/SCSI and work with you to create real
personality extentions.
sd.c direct		sane			ide-disk.c
sr.c optical/rom	more sg'ish		ide-cd.c/ide-floppy.c
st.c stream		noise makes from hell.	ide-tape.c
My goal is to force the personalities in ata/atapi to deal with their own
errors and destroy the mainloop error thread/jungle.  Also export to the
personality cores their own request and completion mappings.
I think similar things could be done in SCSI vi SG, then close up some of
the goofiness we both have (me more so) on HBA or OBHA (onboard).
Comments?
