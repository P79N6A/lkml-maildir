Hi,
i just discoivered that the 2.2pre1 and my former kernel the 2.1.132
(both with the ac patches) are expiring the arp entrys much faster than 
2.0 did.
I discovered by booting a Decstation with a linux-mips kernel via
tftp. Bootp and tftp work but after 20 seconds it stops downloading.
In the tcpdump you see the tftp server sending arp requests. It
seems that the decstation doesnt answer arp requests while tftp downloading.
If you do an "arp -an" you dont see an arp entry for the decstation or
its "incomplete".
If you statically hardcode the arp entry via arp -s it works
perfectly. Has recently something changed in the arp state machien etc ?
