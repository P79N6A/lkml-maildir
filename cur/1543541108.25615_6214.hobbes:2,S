The bay networks ga620, 3com gig cards and (alteon of course) are all
based on Alteon's chipset. The Bay tends to have the lowest street price
(around $300) so I prefer those (cheap bastard) but I've had good luck
with all three.
Given that as far as I can tell alcatell is doing their darndest to kill
off the packet engines nic chipsets in the market place, alteon seems like
the cats pajamas...
