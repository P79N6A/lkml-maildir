Ok, same kind of problem caused by the "radeon" driver in XFree,
it tries to restore some vesa stuffs and fails, and for some reason
radeonfb doesn't properly reconfigure the chip.
As soon as i get this x86 box here, I'll try to find a fix. A
workaround is to use the "radeon" driver in XFree with the
Option "UseFBDev" "true"
