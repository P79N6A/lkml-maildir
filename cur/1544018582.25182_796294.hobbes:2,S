Sorry, the NR_CPUS/MAX_NUMNODE arrays are a merge blocker imho
because they explode with CONFIG_MAXSMP.

I see you fixed the static arrays.
Doing the same for the kmem_cache arrays with making them a pointer
and then using num_possible_{cpus,nodes}() would seem straight forward,
wouldn't it?
Although I think I would prefer alloc_percpu, possibly with
per_cpu_ptr(first_cpu(node_to_cpumask(node)), ...)

You already have a node online notifier that should handle that then, don't you?
x86-64 btw currently doesn't support node hotplug (but I expect it will
be added at some point), but it should be ok even on architectures
that do.

All I'm saying is that when x86-64 finds a memory less node it assigns
its CPUs to other nodes. Hmm ok perhaps there's a backdoor when someone
sets it with kmalloc_node() but that should normally not happen I think.

I'm sure such a straight forward change could be still put into .29

Hmm to be honest it's a little weird to post so much code and then
say you can't change large parts of it.
Could you perhaps mark all the code you don't want to change?
I'm not sure I follow the rationale for not changing code that has been
copied from elsewhere. If you copied it why can't you change it?

But still if you copy code from slub you can improve it, can't you?
The sysfs code definitely could be done much nicer (ok for small values
of "nice"; sysfs is always ugly of course @). But at least it can be
done in a way that doesn't bloat the text so much.
Thanks for the patch.
One thing I'm not sure about is using a private lock to hold off hotplug.
I don't have a concrete scenario, but it makes me uneasy considering
deadlocks when someone sleeps etc. Safer is get/put_online_cpus()
