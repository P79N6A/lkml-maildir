I guess you need only on systems that support >1 cpu right? I doubt you will need
it on a system that cannot run with the config-generic-arch on. although we use bigsmp 
when hotplug is turned on, all we really end up is using flat physical mode instead
of using logical mode.
I still havent understood why this wont work. Choosing CONFIG_X86_GENERICARCH shouldnt
break anything AFAICT.
Pavel, you could use CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, just need to enable X86_GENERICARCH now. 
Is there a reason you think that wont work? I wish we would revert it for a strong 
reason that we know will not make hotplug work on certain systems because of this choise
not that we currently have X86_PC now, and are unwiling to change the config.
(PS: the word bigsmp although sounds like some large NR_CPUS, its just using a mode that
permits the system to work from 1 .. >8 cpus. So there is really nothing determental 
to selecting this.)
