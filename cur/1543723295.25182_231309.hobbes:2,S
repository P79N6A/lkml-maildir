I can't say the situation is the same here -- actually, it seems to be
more related (in my case) to idle times: usually this happens when the
system is under light load (or under no load at all), like between
0:00am and 6:00am. This is why my primary suspect is APM (I could be
completely wrong, of course). Also, I don't have wifi.

Yeah, I know what you mean: the same Linux distro has been running
flawlessly on other boxes around here for months (with different
hardware specs, though). Mine OTOH has a sad uptime record of 5 days...
=(
I agree Linux works (actually, it rocks =)), been using it for years
both at home and at work, but sometimes a specific hardware combination
(or buggy hardware/BIOS/firmware etc.) pushes it to the edge, reaching
some weak spots that need to be "hardened". Some hardware simply doesn't
work at all (I hope that's not my case...)
Best,
Andre
