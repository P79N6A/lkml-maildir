The use of "immediate" here means no other sync function needs to
be called to access the data - ie don't need to call pci_sync_single().
In general, the accesses are ordered following PCI ordering rules.
But every architecture (including x86) has issues with "inflight" DMA.
Line based Interrupts are delivered on a different path than DMA 
and thus ordering can't be enforced.
For example, the code around the following comment in drivers/net/tg3.c:
	/*
	 * Flush PCI write.  This also guarantees that our
	 * status block has been flushed to host memory.
	 */

No - the data is still in flight and in some deterministic time frame
will become visible to the CPU.
Calling it a "caching effect" confuses the issues even worse.

Yes, that's correct - but it's orthogonal to "cache coherent".

Not "wrong", just misunderstood. ;^)
