Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Convert a HiSax driver to the PCI hotplug API
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch series presents a series of five patches, the end result
being a HiSax driver modularized and converted to use the standard PCI
hotplug API (and not pci_find_device).
1) HiSax: move card setup into separate function
2) HiSax: move card state alloc/setup code into separate functions
3) HiSax: modularize card setup; introduce simple hotplug API
4) HiSax netjet_s: code movement, prep for hotplug
5) HiSax netjet_s: convert to PCI hotplug API
As discussed a month or two ago when I submitted my first ISDN PCI
cleanup patch...  kkeil suggested that I do a sample PCI API conversion,
from which others could model HiSax driver conversion work.
DO NOT APPLY.  It is 98% upstream ready, and ready for testing/debug,
but some changes in patch #5 need to be moved to patches 1-3.
And most importantly, I do not have access to ISDN hardware, so kkeil
or somebody will need to be able to test and debug this stuff :/
This work can be found on the 'isdn-pci' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/misc-2.6.git

P.S. "DO NOT APPLY" is only for upstream.  It would be great for this to
appear in -mm.
