Yeah, i know it's about the start time - what else could it possibly be 
about? As i wrote:

Your change changes the initial start time to be longer by +1 jiffy. My 
"restores to half of what 2.6 did" observation was in reference to the 
start time. The other half is the interval time between timeouts. If you 
add a +1 jiffy to the start time, you ought to do it for the interval 
time too. Or do it for neither - which is what we chose to do.
Yes, the 2.6 regression in the bugzilla was _mainly_ about the intervals 
adding a comulative +1, but obviously the behavior should be symmetric: 
if we use our higher resolution for intervals, we should use it for the 
start time too.
In other words: your patch re-introduces half of the bug on low-res 
platforms. Users doing a series of one-shot itimer calls would be 
exposed to the same kind of (incorrect and unnecessary) summing-up 
errors. What's the point?
