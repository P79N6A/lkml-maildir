I think this is confusing; in a sentence about SMP, I expect to hear
how many processors are supported...is that 64 now? I'd thought it was
16, actually (and had wondered which cpu/mboard allows more than 4).
And then, of course, go ahead with the comment about that 64-bit cpu's
are of course supported, too.
Perhaps a very simple change fixes that:
"Already legendary Linux performance is significantly enhanced. High end SMP
 support scales well, supporting up to 16 processors, each up to 64-bit."
Or "...up to 16 processors. Both 32-bit and 64-bit processors are supported."
There's also a minor typo: in "Estimates suggest that Linux has up to
20 million users", the word "suggest" is mistyped as "suggets" in draft 6.
The rest of it is great!
