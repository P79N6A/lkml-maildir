I trust that && BROKEN won't happen before it will actually *be*
obsolete and correctly re-labelled as such. As for the && !HOTPLUG
menace you keep touting, that might perhaps be applied to some of
the individual hardware device drivers but certainly not to the
I4L core itself. What you mean by "or similar" I cannot guess.
AFAIK we don't have an && EYESORE option yet. :-)

Not sure I'm following you. There is an official maintainer, and
although he's currently rather silent on this topic, there's no
reason to believe he won't step up if there's actually some urgent
maintaining to be done.

Is that a serious suggestion? Replace one wrong label with another,
even wronger one? I don't see how that might help.

Do I sense some hidden agenda there?
The isdn4linux subsystem will not "progress" to BROKEN unless
somebody pushes it there. It is currently working sufficiently
well for its users to fill the gap until its successor CAPI is
ready. Once that happens, it can be obsoleted, but not before.
I know people are less than happy this hasn't happened yet, but
the way to promote the move to CAPI is not to kill off I4L before
the time and leave users standing in the rain.
Thanks,
Tilman
