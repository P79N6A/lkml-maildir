Is anyone actually paying attention?  Note that I didn't say that Linux, in
general, has no support.  I said that Linux is not supported with the
*specific* piece of hardware that I was referring to (which, BTW, is
Digital's [now Compaq's] StorageWorks line).  That means that even if a
piece of hardware breaks, for example, Compaq will not send a support
person on site because you aren't running a supported configuration.  Good
luck getting someone from comp.os.linux.* to come on-site within 4 hours to
fix your broken storage subsystem that isn't even related to Linux.  Does
ADK do that?
If you want to be paranoid about "FUD" then that's your perogative.  But
public accusations don't buy you anything when you are that obviously
wrong.
Finally, this isn't a kernel issue.  Drop it.

I still don't think you even have an inkling of how paranoid these people
are.  A UPS can fail, software can crash, a CPU can fail, a large chunk of
ice from an airplane can crash through the roof and slice right through the
power cable, ...
