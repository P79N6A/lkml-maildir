The Sintran OS for the Norsk Data minicomputers had something similar. A
new version was created every time a file was opened for writing.
It had its disadvantages. A typical machine where I worked at the time
had one 60MB disk. However, you could set the number of copies on a
per-file-basis, so big databases wouldn't have to be duplicated.
