Hi Andrew,
we call the exact same functions in cpufreq during startup and in
response to cpu hotplug events, to create or destroy
sysfs entries /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/cpufreq/*. cpufreq_add_dev().
problem is cpufreq_set_policy()  eventually ends up calling
__cpufreq_driver_target() during the CPU_ONLINE, and CPU_DOWN_PREPARE
that takes cpucontrol lock.
Since when we already in the cpu notifier callbacks, cpucontrol is already 
held by the cpu_up() or the cpu_down() that caused the double lock.
i dont see a panic, but just when we try to do cpu_down, or cpu_up that
thread would just lock out waiting to acquire the cpucontrol the second
time.
Hope this helps.
