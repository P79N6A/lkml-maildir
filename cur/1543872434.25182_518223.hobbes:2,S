Indeed.  FWIW my NTFS driver does not use the generic file write  
helper function and instead has its own code that does the allocation  
first and then does the writing a page at a time much the same as  
generic file write does so depending on what this new interface ends  
up looking like exactly I may well be able to switch the NTFS driver  
to use it instead of doing everything by myself and duplicating a ton  
of code from the VFS...
Best regards,
