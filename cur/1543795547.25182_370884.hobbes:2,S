Sure enough, I can confirm this.
I don't seem to have to provide --no-same-permissions to tar to get umask to 
affect the permissions of extracted files, so my files are fine on-disc.
What disturbs me more is the number of people using insecure umasks before 
checking files in! When does a text file really want to be a+w?
