However, this I take issue with.
Conceptually (and what the user ends up actually using), struct sigevent
is just:
struct sigevent
{
	int sigev_notify;			 /* delivery method */
	sigval_t sigev_value			 /* user cookie */
	int sigev_signo;			 /* signal number */
	void (*sigev_notify_function)(sigval_t); /* thread fn */
	pthread_attr_t *sigev_notify_attributes; /* thread attr */
};
You could complain about sigval_t being a union, but that's probably
just because it predates uintptr_t. (Plus, no ugly casting.)
You also could complain that the above isn't what you actually see when
you look at /usr/include/bits/siginfo.h -- there's a union involved and
some macros to hide the fact, but that's just internal implementation
details related to how threads are created and padding out the struct
for any future expansion. 
The actual complexity for understanding and using struct sigevent isn't
all that much, and once you've figured that out, you know how to
configure event delivery for AIO completion, DNS resolution, and
messages queues, not just timers.

But timers aren't files or even remotely file-like -- if they were a
real files, you could just
open /dev/timers/realtime/2007/June/3rd/half-past-teatime and get a
timer. (Or, more realisticly, open /dev/timer and use ioctl().)
timerfd() had to be created to coerce them into some semblance of
filehood just to make them work with existing (and new) polling/queuing
interfaces just because those interfaces can only deal with file
descriptors.
Making non-file things look like files just because that's what poll()
and friends can deal with isn't much different from holding a hammer in
your hand and looking for what you have to do in order to turn every
problem into a nail.
Sometimes you need to go back to your toolbox for a screwdriver or a
saw.

But the API isn't baroque.
There's a veritable boutique of clock sources to choose from, but they
all serve specific needs, it's just one parameter to timer_create, and
you probably want CLOCK_MONOTONIC anyway.
struct sigevent  might be a bit complex, but the difficultly in learning
that is amortized across all the other APIs that also use it to specify
how their events are delivered.
Delivering via signals and dealing with struct siginfo is painful, but
everything related to signals is painful. This is what you get when you
take an interface designed essentially for exception handling and start
abusing it for general information delivery. But, hey!, that's what
SIGEV_THREAD and SIGEV_PORT are for.[1]
About the worst that can be said of it is that using timer_settime to
both arm and disarm the timer and set the interval is awkward.
[1] A SIGEV_FUNCTION which skips all the signal baggage and just passes
a supplied cookie and a purpose-specific struct pointer to an
object-specific user-supplied function pointer might be interesting, but
then you run into all of the reentrancy/masking/choosing which thread to
deliver to and other issues that signals already have without the
benefit of the existing signal infrastructure for all that stuff. Gah, I
don't want to think about this anymore.
