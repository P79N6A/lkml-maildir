Subject: ok, one more time -- FS config file patch for cleanup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  for anyone's who's interested, my latest submission for a
cleaner config file for filesystems is online at:
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/kconfig/fsmenu-2561.patch
  i did nothing more than move stuff around and make some
submenus -- the config entries are as they were in the
stock 2.5.61 release, but now grouped logically with 
more common stuff at the top and more obscure stuff
lower down in each menu.
  comments?  it may not be ideal, but it's a starting point,
while i move on to other parts of the menu structure.
