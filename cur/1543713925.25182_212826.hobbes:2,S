hi,
recently i have problems with my 2.6.4 on debian sid. the server is not 
starting with the message "[drm radeon_cp_init] *ERROR* radeon_cp_init 
called without lock held". i had a short look on dmesg a found out that 
also a sound driver was not found, allthough i picked it when doing 
"make menuconfig".
First i thought, i might have made a mistake when konfiguring the 
kernel. But i compiled it several times and even changed to version 2.6.5.
maybe anyone, who has experienced this problem, can help me
thank you
matze
