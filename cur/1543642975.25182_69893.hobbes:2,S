Quite possibly.  The P3 has roughly an 800MB/s FSB bandwidth, that must
be used for both I/O and memory accesses.  So just driving a gige card at
wire speed takes a considerable portion of the cpus capacity.  
On analyzing this kind of thing I usually find it quite helpful to
compute what the hardware can theoretically to get a feel where the
bottlenecks should be.
