The return value from find_get_pages() is "how many pages did I find" - it
doesn't tell us whether they were contiguous.
How about
	if (i && (pages[i - 1]->index == index + i - 1))
<thinks>
So if we asked for N pages starting at index=10 and got
	[11, 13]
i == 2
pages[i-1]->index == 13
index + i - 1 == 11.
So I think it's OK.  Yeah, it has to be - any gap at all in the returned
page array will make pages[i-1]->index too big.
The one-at-a-time logic looks OK from a quick scan.  Do we have logic in
there to check that we're not overrunning i_size?  (See the pain
do_generic_mapping_read() goes through).
argh, readahead.  Really we should be kicking the readahead engine in there
as well.  That's fairly straightforward - see do_generic_mapping_read().
Also, the code here _might_ be able to use do_page_cache_readahead() just
to prepopulate the pages which you know you'll be needing.  There are no
guarantees that the pages will still be there when you want them of course,
but it's a decent way of putting a block of pages into a single BIO and
speeding up the common case.  But if the code is calling
page_cache_readahead() it won't need to do that.
