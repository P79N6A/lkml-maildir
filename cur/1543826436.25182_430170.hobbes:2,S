So it happens with r-w-migration-entries but not without fix-2? Or does 
it require the fix-2 in order to happen? Without the fix page migration 
is broken.
Does LTP include any page migration tests? Guess not? If not then this 
could be simply due to code rearrangement making the problem appear in a 
different way.
Which test did this?
Swap migration uses the two higest numbers of swap types (30 and 31). If 
those are generated by something then we could have trouble but I do not 
see how the patches could hurt otherwise.
