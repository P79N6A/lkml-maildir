Hello Everyone,
A long time back there was discussion over setuid/setgid and how its been 
replaced by Capabilities (This is what i understood from the 
archives...please correct me if im wrong).
I'd like to know the possibility of using setgid for users to switch their 
groups and work as a member of a particular group. Essentially, if i want 
one user, who belongs to groups X, Y and Z to create a file as a member of 
group Y while he's logged on as a member of group X, would it be possible 
through setgid() ? 
would i need to change all programs that need this capability ? 
or is there a way in the kernel do achieve this ? 
Can i use capabilities in some way to achieve this ?
Any pointers would be really helpful. i don't mind reading up on heavy 
documentation, if i only know where to look. 
Also, im not subscribed to this list, so I'd appreciate it if replies 
could be CC'd to gami@d10systems.com. If there's any other information 
that I should provide to clarify my question, please let me know.
Thanks !
regards,
Gami
