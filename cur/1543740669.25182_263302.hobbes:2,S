Agree completely. kcond implementation is very inefficient. But it's
"obviously correct" at that. Idea was to optimize it later, when we
would have time for this. Didn't happen so far.

This is quite questionable. Where is this complexity? Standard condition
variable usage looks like
    spin_lock(&lock);
    while (!predicate)
        kcond_wait(&cond_var, &lock);
    /*
     * at this point predicate is true and @lock is held
     */
This can, of course, be implemented with wait-queues, but:
 - condition variables are used idiomatically, and hence, contain strong
   hint about what code tries to achieve.
 - their API is designed to match their (rather narrow) usage. For
   example, kcond_wait() takes lock as an argument and can (given proper
   debugging support in the spin-lock implementation) check that this lock
   is actually locked by the calling thread.

Difference between a condition variable and "atomic synchronization
primitives" is like difference between a spin-lock and open-coded Dekker
algorithm: both provide you with mutual exclusion, but the former gives
one distinct clue about what is going on.
Umm... I have better example: every algorithm can be coded without loop
statements, with goto-s only. And (given proper programmer) goto
produces better assembly than while(). Does this constitutes an argument
in favor of throwing away all these wimpy loops that no Real Programmer
should use?

A kernel daemon that waits for some work to do is an example.
(And just to fight what seems to be common misconception: condition
variables were not introduced by POSIX committee, they are much older
than that. As all synchronization primitives they originate from the
kernel land.)
