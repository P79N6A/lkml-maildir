Sorry, I can't fully understand you. You mean only the above change is horrid or
the entire patch?
I have some questions about mtd/maps drivers. Even when I use `make allyesconfig`,
I still can't compile some drivers. I should add the corresponding CONFIGs manually.
Why this? And I still got some errors and warnings, such as:
drivers/mtd/maps/pmcmsp-flash.c:40:22: error: msp_prom.h: No such file or directory
drivers/mtd/maps/pmcmsp-flash.c:41:22: error: msp_regs.h: No such file or directory
drivers/mtd/maps/pmcmsp-flash.c: In function 'init_msp_flash':
drivers/mtd/maps/pmcmsp-flash.c:62: error: 'DEV_ID_REG' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/mtd/maps/pmcmsp-flash.c:62: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/mtd/maps/pmcmsp-flash.c:62: error: for each function it appears in.)
drivers/mtd/maps/pmcmsp-flash.c:62: error: 'DEV_ID_SINGLE_PC' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/mtd/maps/pmcmsp-flash.c:63: error: 'ELB_1PC_EN_REG' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/mtd/maps/pmcmsp-flash.c:63: error: 'SINGLE_PCCARD' undeclared (first use in this function)
Did I miss something?
Thanks!
