Updating the time in remove_vma() would fix this, no?

Use file_update_time(), which will do the right thing.  It will in
fact do the same thing as write(2) on the device, which is really what
we want.
Block devices being mapped for write through different device
nodes..., well, I don't think we really need to handle such weird
corner cases 100% acurately.
