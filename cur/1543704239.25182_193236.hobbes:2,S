Right, but random words result in strange couplings of words.  
Statistical filters should be working on phrases, not just individual
words. So to the statistical filter random words will just be
meaningless noise, neither an indicator of goodness nor of spamness.
(unless a spammer reuses a boilerplate 'random word' section - in
which case it'll be an indicator of spamness).
