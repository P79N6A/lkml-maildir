Sigh...  2.3.11 won't boot on my Cyrix 6x86L/P200+, even with the Cyrix
coma bugfix code added back in (which was needed to get 2.3.10 to boot).
Same symptoms as I reported earlier when 2.3.10 wasn't booting: the
vesafb code switches the video mode (vga = 791), then the machine
freezes.
I'll do a little poking around to see if I can figure out what changed
that might affect the boot process, but if anyone has any ideas I'll be
more than happy to listen.
gcc-2.8.1
binutils-2.9.1.0.25
glibc-2.0.7
