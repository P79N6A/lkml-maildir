Correct!  (-:

Correct.
I just sent you a long description of the process before reading your
email above...  Did not need to bother if I knew you already understood
the case!

I really do not want to do that.  It would penalise ntfs performance in
the general case by introducing "if in mount don't lock otherwise lock"
checks everywhere in the driver pretty much or you would need to
duplicate a ton of code which I avoided duplicating exactly using my
bootstrapping mechanism which is why it exists in the first place!
And given the only reason for the change you want to make is to make the
lock validator happy I would much rather you did something with the lock
validator instead...  Can't you just insert a call to the validator in
ntfs_fill_super() just before the call to ntfs_read_inode_mount() to the
effect of "turn_off_lock_validator_data_gathering()" and then just after
ntfs_read_inode_mount() returns insert a call to the validator to the
effect of "turn_on_lock_validator_data_gathering()".
Does that sound reasonable to you?
I really cannot see why code needs to be penalised for a validator...  I
would much rather see a complicated and slow lock validator then a
complicated and slow driver given a lock validator is only compiled in
for debugging purposes whilst a driver is compiled in all kernels
including release ones...
Best regards,
