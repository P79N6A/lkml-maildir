I do not say 'hey, include it now, or I will cry', I just want to have
_some_ progress. But I do not get _any_ feedback. What should I think?
I doubt bothering people each third day with new resend is a good idea,
so I plan to drop it.
Btw, Andrew dropped 'take23' patchset from his tree, when it was
obsoleted, but did not import later versions :)

No. I do not want immediate inclusion, I want progress, so I could setup
my plans on it - if people keep silence, I stop this and work on my own
kevent goals, since I like current state of hte kevent for my tasks.
I do not hack for inclusion.

So comment on its bugs, its design, implementation, ask questions,
request features, show interest (even with 'I have no time right now,
but will loko at it after in a week after vacations').
No one does it, so no one cares, so my behaviour.
