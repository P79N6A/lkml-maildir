We fixed a somewhat-known number of machines and broke an unknown number. 
Linus will come after you with a pointy stick if he finds out.
Fixing previously-broken machines is nice, but breaking previously-working
ones gets people a lot more upset.

Suggest that the feature be disabled until we have most of these
blacklistings in place.
We have a tremendous number of regressions in 2.6.24 (and they're just the
ones which we know of) and the regression reports for 2.6.23 are still
coming in.  At some stage we'll need to get seriosu about this.
