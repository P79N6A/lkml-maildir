You did that from an xterm, right? Which console device is the xterm running on?
X starts up a process that knows which device it is running and it can
remember that device since X stays running.
Maybe the answer is that this is something for the VC layer since the
VC layer stays running and knows what device it was started on. An
escape sequence could query the device from the VC terminal emulator.
Is there some way to figure this out from the environment?
