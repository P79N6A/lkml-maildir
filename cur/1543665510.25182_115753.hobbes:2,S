On further investigation I find that "swapoff <anyPartition>" will produce
the same oops and segfault in /sbin/swapoff, whereas if I supply a totally
bogus argument like 'swapoff xyz' I get an appropriate error message
instead of the oops:
swapoff("xyz")                          = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
write(2, "swapoff: xyz: No such file or di"..., 40swapoff: xyz: No such file or 
directory
) = 40
_exit(-1)                               = ?
