I remember some discussion about having /proc/kcore, /proc/*/mem and
similar (large memory-images) as special files rather that normal files as
they are now.
what's the current status? I'd like them special, because then I could do
something like
tar cvzf ~/status-´date +%Y%M%D` /proc
and have most of the machine's status backuped.
As long as they are normal files, this operation results in a very big
tar-archive - with the resulting caveats (space needed, some things saved
noticeable time before others).
