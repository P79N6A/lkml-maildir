I wouldn't worry aboyt that.  A licence manager depending on
MAC addresses simply isn't doing its job.  
Moving a ethernet card from one computer to another is
perfectly legal if you own both of them.  So it is the
licence manager that is broken.  
I know no law that require IEEE conformant networks either.
If I want to run a net with crazy MAC addresses then I
can do so -  and deal with interoperability problems myself.
Piracy is still illegal of course, but nobody can force
me to keep a broken licence manager in working order. :-)
