`lsmod` shows that a device is open twice when using Linux-2.4.0-test9
when, in fact, it has been opened only once.
lsmod is version 2.3.15, the latest-and-greatest.
Here are the open/close routines for a module.
/*-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=*/
/*
 *  Open the device.
 */
static int device_open(struct inode *inp, struct file *fp)
{
    DEB(printk("%s open\n", info->dev));
    MOD_INC_USE_COUNT;                         /* Increment usage count */
    return 0;
} 
/*-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=*/
/*
 *  Close the device.
 */
static int device_close(struct inode *inp, struct file *fp)
{
    DEB(printk("%s close\n", info->dev));
    MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT;                         /* Decrement usage count */
    return 0;
} 
When the module is closed, the use-count goes to zero as expected.
However, a single open() causes the use-count to be 2.
In a possibly-related observation, during the change-root from
an initial RAM disk to the root file system during boot, the
d_count used to be reported as '1'. It is now '3'.
