As you mention below, the limit can be reduced after a file has been opened,
meaning that fd's could be missed.

As I understand it, only the kernel actually knowns the upper bound,
and without using a HACK such as listing /proc/self/fd/, it would be
necessary for the kernel to do the closing -- but I suspect that such
a change is likely to breaks certain programmes ...
Hmmm -- reading the man page in pedantic mode allows a different
interpretation ....
It suggests to me that by using dup2, it should be possible to get a very
high valued fd (much greater than the value of RLIMIT_NOFILE, and that
setting RLIMIT_NOFILE to zero *should* close all files :-))  It says:
       RLIMIT_NOFILE  /* max number of open files */
i.e. not (take off one as thge first fd is numbered zero) "the highest value
of fd that can be opened" [ which is how I have always interpreted it ]
but the *MAX NUMBER* of files (no mention of the fd values) that *CAN BE*
open (rather than that open / dup / dup2 can return) -- snigger !
