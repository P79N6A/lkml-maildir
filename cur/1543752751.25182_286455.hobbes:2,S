Don't hold your breath waiting for Ben's input. However, I would like to
get one of the two proposed committed and tested by more users as this
is a sore spot. I am not in a position at this time to fully research
and test to make a call.

Sounds like a sign-off. Any other input before I request Stefan to make
the final decision?

How much of this is "curiosity" vs a real risk?
