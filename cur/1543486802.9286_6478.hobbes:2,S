You can be executing  open and interrupt handlers together the moment
you don't have interrupts on.
You can be executing get_stats, do_ioctl, hard_start_xmit and the receive
irq in parallel if you have enough cpus. I think close as well, but I'd
have to check.

Its not just about interrupting. They can be running in parallel on
multiple processors

It can be run from a bottom half (normally timer_bh or net_bh). The
transmit function itself won't be recursively re-entered and when
it is called bh handling is blocked (please dont rely on that for 2.3,
just rely on the drivers transmit function not being re-entered)
