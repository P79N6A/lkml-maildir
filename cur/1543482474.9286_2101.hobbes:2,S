Most propably you will need to recompile all modules then first too.

Yes versioning is a broken design which will however most of the time
work, since it doesn't give you anything and therefore there isn't
anything
for it to really break. However don't expect it to really solve the
upgrade problem. It will just hide the problems more deeply.
