I was a little unclear. Both specs define bit 7 as the low-voltage
range but only the MMC spec defines the actual voltage. As such, there
is no complete definition of a low voltage SD card. That's why I added
the sanity check in the actual code.

Yeah, I thought you'd think that :-) I'll post the two diffs shortly.
