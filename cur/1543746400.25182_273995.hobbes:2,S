Well, I think, there's just a local APIC on the system, and that is 
disabled in BIOS (there's no way to enable it). 2.6.3 disables VIA 
external APIC routing, as you noticed, whereas 2.6.7 sais 
Local APIC disabled by BIOS -- reenabling.
Found and enabled local APIC!
2.6.9 respects BIOS decision (I think, there was a thread on LKML on 
this?):
No local APIC present or hardware disabled

I'll try to do all this tomorrow and report results.
