May I make a programming style suggestion? When you find a parameter
out-of-range, don't just print that it's out of range, but print the
actual value as well. This message would have become:
	FAT: Number of reserved sectors (0) out of range. 
Even better would be to print the range as well:
	FAT: Number of reserved sectors (0) out of range (1..16). 
(I just made the number up, I haven't looked in the code what the
valid range actually is...).
