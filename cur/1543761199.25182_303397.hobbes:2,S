in the long run, most of it. There are no conceptual barriers so far,
the -RT tree consists of lots of small details and the PREEMPT_RT
framework itself. We are trying to solve (and merge) the small details
first (in upstream), so that PREEMPT_RT itself becomes uncontroversial.
(and it's not really the low latency that matters mainly - more valuable
is the fact that under PREEMPT_RT high latencies are statistically much
more unlikely [you need to do some really intentional and easy to see
things to introduce high latencies], while in the current upstream
kernel, high latencies are often side-effects of pretty normal kernel
coding activities, so low latencies are always a catch-up game that can
never be truly won for sure. So yes, while a 10 usec worst-case latency
under arbitrary Linux workloads [on the right hardware] is indeed sexy,
more important is that things are much more deterministic and hence much
more trustable from a hard-RT POV.)
