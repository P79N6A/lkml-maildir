Ick, ok, the problem is that my "virtual device" patch isn't in my
"public" patch set that Andrew pulls from.  It will fix this issue up.
I'll work on cleaning it up to be used by everyone tomorrow and move it
to the tree that Andrew pulls from.  Then the next -mm release should
have this issue fixed.
If you want to verify this, please apply the patch at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/patches/device-virtual.patch
and let me know if it solves your issue (note that the reference
counting is not completly correct in that patch, that's why I haven't
unleashed it on -mm yet.)
thanks,
greg k-h
