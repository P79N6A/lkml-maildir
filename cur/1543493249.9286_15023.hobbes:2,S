   not likely. solaris VM is like SVR4, right ?(or rather, the other
   way round). their writes go through page cache. their buffer cache
   is usually used only for filesystem metadata. so there's no reason
   to do a copy. but they have other overheads like having to map the
   page into kernel space before doing IO (unlike linux which maps all
   physical mem, so this step is trivial).
I believe they have the same buffercache/pagecache issues we do.
If you look in the Solaris header files (/usr/include/sys/buf.h to be
exact) they have a page struct pointer in the buffer structure which
seems to support my theory.  It's just a theory, I could be wrong.
