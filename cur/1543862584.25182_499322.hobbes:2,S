ok, I can work on a version of this that uses struct iodesc.  Maybe
something like this?
struct iodesc {
        struct iovec *iov;
        unsigned long nr_segs;
        size_t nbytes;
};
I suppose it's worth doing the iodesc thing along with this patchset
anyway, since it'll avoid an extra round of interface churn.
