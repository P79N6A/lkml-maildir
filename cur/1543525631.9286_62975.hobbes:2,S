It is still there, 2.3.39 and worse,
now my filesystem gets seriously screwed on unpacking of linux kernel
sources. multiple files that ls does not show but rmdir and bash
autocomplete
can see.
And it is repeatable now.
untar sources, multiple such errors, unmount,
fsck no errors, mount, rm, still errors
reboot, boot 2.2.13, no errors at mount,
can rm no problems.
SMP, ext2, dual celeron, not OC this time, tyan tiger 100 MB,
kernel  386 optimized this time, IBM-DJNA-370910
If ext2 maintainer refuses to ack the error, could I get then a
time-saving hint about how to test/prove it (if I have time left
from softnet conversions)
elmer.
