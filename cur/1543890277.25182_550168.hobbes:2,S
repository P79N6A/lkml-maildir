I didn't notice anything.

I think the bug in 2.6.21/22-rc3 is a different one that the one in 
2.6.22-rc2-mm1, but that's also only a wild guess :)
I'll explain this a bit:
In 2.6.21/22-rc3 is the same b44 driver that has been in the stock kernels for 
some time. With this driver and High Resolution Timer turned on I get 
problems using iperf. The problems are that the systems becomes really slow 
and unresponsive.  Michael Buesch thought this could be an IRQ storm which 
sounds logical to me. This bug did never happen to me before I startet the 
iperf test.
The other issue happens only with 2.6.22-rc2-mm1 which includes the b44 ssb 
spilt. It's independed wether High Resolution Timer is turned on or off I 
always get very varying and high ping times. The iperf-test doesn't show the 
problems from 2.6.21/22-rc3.
