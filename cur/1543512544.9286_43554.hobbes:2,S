    Regrettably, I am not familiar with the ``ip'' command and the rest
    of the fallout from the wholescale renovation of networking for
    2.2+; but at least for netkit-a-0.06, the only tools I can find that
    actually _break_ are rarp and netstat (others, like ifconfig, seem
    to simply lose their statistics gathering;  I'd find out for
    certain, except that klogd is someone else that uses /proc when it
    can, and thus /proc is locked open for me) while route and the
    interface binding parts of ifconfig continue to work.

   There seem to be a few factions in Linux development;  there are at
   least experimentalists, traditionalists, compatabilitists, and high
   priests.  There's not much that gets into the kernel unless it passes
   by members of each of those groups.  Networking and kernel interfaces
   seem to be pretty firmly in the experimentalist camp, but the rest of
   the developer world seems to be pretty evenly split between most of
   those four factions.
   Think twice?  That's simple, it's done all the time.  And then what?
