s/very low/not low/
Rebasing is always a pain, and John and I both agreed the other day that 
you do it too often.
I've complained about this before, too...  but figured this was just 
another thing I was getting ignored on, and so life moved on.  But don't 
try to sell rebasing as "low pain".
Rebasing makes the history all nice and pretty, but by totalling 
flattening the history, trashing all the commit ids (and rewriting 
associated metadata), you create obvious downstream problems.
Rebasing is  low impact only if you don't have git downstream people. 
Otherwise, you're just treating it as a useful quilt clone, really.
