Simon, please run:
  udevinfo --attribute-walk --path=<devpath>
for the mouse on the working and the non-working kernel.
And make sure you have only one rule for input devices or  use
SYMLINK+="", otherwise it overwrites any earlier rule. And if you have
an earlier rule which already names the device, this one will be
ignored because it has NAME= in it.

It looks fine to me. "device" links must never point to anything else
than a bus device.
