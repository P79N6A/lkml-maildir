It's much more interesting now than it used to be because PCI-Express
is now mainstream and it has standard registers to report errors.
Whatever is adopted should definitely try to handle this.
Unfortunately no standardized exceptions, but at least some Opteron
chipsets can raise NMIs in this case when programmed right.
