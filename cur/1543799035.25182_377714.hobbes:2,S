ok. I can keep it a separate patch - it's needed for -rt, and it's also 
a good debugging tool to test-drive the mutex implementation.  
historically, i found 90% of the mutex.c bugs by stress-testing it from 
userspace, but a crutial 10% did come from the DEBUG_MUTEX_FULL mode, 
where almost all of the 7000+ semaphore users are switched over to 
mutexes.
but in terms of keeping the upstream kernel code base clean, i agree 
with a clean and separate set of mutex APIs that are introduced into 
subsystems gradually.
