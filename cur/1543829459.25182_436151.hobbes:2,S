Subject: [RFC PATCH] add lookup hint for network file systems

Hi,
I'm trying to speeding up mkdir(2) for network file systems.
A typical mkdir(2) calls two inode_operations: lookup and mkdir.
The lookup operation would fail with ENOENT in common case.  I think
it is unnecessary because the subsequent mkdir operation can check it.
In case of creat(2), lookup operation is called with the LOOKUP_CREATE
flag, so individual filesystem can omit real lookup. e.g. nfs_lookup().
Here is a sample patch which uses LOOKUP_CREATE and O_EXCL on mkdir,
symlink and mknod.  This uses the gadget for creat(2).
And here is the result of a benchmark on NFSv3.
  mkdir(2) 10,000 times:
    original  50.5 sec
    patched   29.0 sec
