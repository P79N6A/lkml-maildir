After more carefully analyzing the tcpdumps from each of the server, the
client segment, and the server segment, I've noticed that the problem
doesn't seem to be related to the Linux server at all.
As far as I see from the tcpdumps, we had another machine (apparently a
router) claiming to be the server responding to arp requests.  When
those responses came through, communication with the client and the
server would break, since there were two hosts claiming to be the
server.
We're unplugging that router to see if the problem persists.  Thanks
everyone for your help.  I'll make sure to get more information before
bothering the lists.
