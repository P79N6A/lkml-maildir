Seems to work much better :
Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 439M
agpgart: Detected AMD 761 chipset
agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xf8000000
Actually the previous patch may have worked as well, while trying to figure out why I couldn't
get it to apply I was playing around with the configuration and various other stuff and I may
accidentaly have disabled Irongate support in the kernel that I ended up building. I can retry
the original patch to verify that if you like.
