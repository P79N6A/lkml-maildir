Hi everyone,
Yesterday one of my servers Oops'ed on me :-(
The server was running an old 2.6.13.4 kernel.
I got a screenshot of the Oops which is available here :
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/juhl/images/2.6.13.4-crash.png
Even though this is a rather old kernel, I wanted to report the crash
just in case it's not a known bug. If it is already known and fixed,
then just ignore this mail.
Userspace is also rather old (but the kernel was not build on this box
with that ancient compiler, it's just running here) :
# scripts/ver_linux
If some fields are empty or look unusual you may have an old version.
Compare to the current minimal requirements in Documentation/Changes.
