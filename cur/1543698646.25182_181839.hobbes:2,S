Hello,
I am trying to figure out exactly how Linux assigns generation numbers to
inodes.  In most filesystems (such as ext2/ext3) the generation number is
assigned to event++.  This variable is declared in kernel/timer.c, but
apparently not initialized.  I made 3 files, each one immediately after a
reboot, and this is the information I got:
generation#
10417bbc
bf612079
8cf4b829
From what I can tell, event is only incremented in a few places in the fs
directory.  Can someone please explain if event is actually initialized,
and if so, to what?  And if it is initialized to a specific number, how
are these generation numbers so big and varied?
tia.
