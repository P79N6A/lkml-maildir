Just after booting, you know the state of the hardware (just initialised 
for most things that are not used to /boot/start resume/ from). You need 
to get the hardware in a sort of just-booted state before revering to 
the swsusp image you saved earlier because the drivers (might) expect 
the hardware to be in a certain state when they are started up by swsusp.
So you have to be carefull about the hardware (and not only the 
filesystem) state just before reverting to the swsusp image.
