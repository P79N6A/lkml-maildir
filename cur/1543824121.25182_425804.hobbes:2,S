Mike,
for some users it will really look like broken multimedia on 2.6.17 like
you said. I don't worry to send them to something else then, but it
would really be nice to get the obvious fixes in or a hint, why it is
too late or so.
The mixture of a for some broken 2.6.17 and a upcoming 2.6.18 with huge
changes and a maybe too small testing base could become funny.
But yes, as you said, it are only concerns for now.
Cheers,
Hermann
