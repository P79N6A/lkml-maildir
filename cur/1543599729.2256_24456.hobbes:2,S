I got the impression that linus wanted two opposite things:
   1) every possible bug made to scream out loud until the author
      paid special attention to it and put it to bed with a 
      soothing declaration
   2) completely bona fide promotions made to go silent and not
      warn at all.
I don't see how he can really see 3arg_min/max as satisfying (2), since
the author will have to look at each and every existing min/max to
decide on a type with which to frontload the new min/max.  So I felt
justified in mostly ignoring (2).
On the other hand, he did say something about -Wsignedstuff being too
verbose, so I'm not sure. Maybe the -W really does make noise about
some compares that wouldn't be flagged by the  two constraints I
suggested? If so, perhaps that was what he wanted: a weaker and
more closely controlled -Wsignedgunggg.

I don't know how you know that! You could be right - I don't know.
I haven't seen a tight enough specification of the basic problem
for me to be able to begin to formulate a generic solution. I've just
seen some examples, some more convincing than others.

What makes sizeof(int) so magic? Are you saying that the problems
don't arise between signed long long and unsigned long long? I saw
an example that seemed generic for all signed unsigned comparisons,
namely that signed int and unsigned int are compared as unsigned, so 
(unsigned)2 < (signed)-1.  Are you saying that signed long and unsigned
long are NOT compared as unsigned iff sizeof(long) != sizeof(int).
Woooo!  Who wrote the C spec? No kidding? There is a special clause
for comparisons that use the native machine word?
And I was hoping that somebody could produce some gcc magic
replacement for BUG() that means "don't compile me". Perhaps
a bit of illegal assembler code with a line reference in?
Surely gcc must have something like __builtin_wont_compile()?
It just needs to be a leaf of the RTL that evokes a compile error.
