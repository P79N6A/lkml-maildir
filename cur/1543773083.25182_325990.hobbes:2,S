From a strict RCU viewpoint, you are quite correct.  But sometimes
the overall locking protocol (which almost always includes other things
besides just RCU) places additional constraints on the code.  My guess is
that the networking folks needed to ensure that the new protocol is seen
by all packets that are received after inet_register_protosw() returns.
But I need to defer to networking guys on this one.
