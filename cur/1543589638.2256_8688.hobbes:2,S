Btw, please use "static inline" instead of "extern inline", as gcc may
decide not to inline the latter at all, leading to confusing link-time
errors. (Gcc may also decide not to inline "static inline", but then gcc
will output the actual body of the function out-of-line if it gets used,
so you don't get the link-time failure).
Right now only certain broken versions of gcc will actually show this
behaviour, I think, but it's at least in theory going to be an issue.
