This patch seems to have broken my Logitech Wingman Action usb gamepad,
it shows as connected but isn't claimed by joydev... another joystick I
have (saitek cyborg usb gold) works fine, and the logitech worked in
previous 2.5/6.x kernels so I'm guessing this patch is to blame, I'm on
2.6.0-test5-mm1, is there any info from the joystick I can provide you
with to fix it?  I'm not sure where to look, thanks -Dan
