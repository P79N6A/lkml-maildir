Could you or someone else please explain the problem?
From rom what I have read it seems that userland acesses some bitness
dependent kernel structures. Fixing this would mean to use architecture
independent structures in both kernel- and userland and break existing
applications.
As a user I would be satisfied if DRI is available for 64-bit
applications on x86_64 and 32-bit applications do not cause the kernel
to crash.

PS: I have Fedora running on a dual Opteron system with a Matrox
Millenium G550, tell me if you want to test something.
