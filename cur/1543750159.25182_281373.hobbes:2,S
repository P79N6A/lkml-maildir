Hi,
I browsed the patch quickly to check for kallsyms uses, and validate 
them, and it generally seems correct.
There is however one comment that makes me wonder:
*2.6 kallsyms has a "feature" where it unpacks the name into a string.
*If that string is reused before the caller expects it then the caller
*sees its string change without warning.
kallsyms_lookup always uses the buffer passed to it in the case the 
symbol is a kernel symbol, as opposed to a module symbol, and so it is 
not responsible for the buffer.
So this probably only happens when a module symbol is returned directly 
from its symbol table, and then the module is unloaded (or something 
like that).
Later there is another comment:
* Another 2.6 kallsyms "feature".  Sometimes the sym_name is
* set but the buffer passed into kallsyms_lookup is not used,
* so it contains garbage.
It seems to be the same problem. If we modify kallsyms_lookup to always 
use the buffer passed, even if the symbol comes from a module, maybe we 
could solve both problems with just one change.
On the downside, a caller that just wants to print the name, would pay 
an unnecessary string copy.
On the upside, this would make the interface more coherent with standard 
C functions like strcpy, where the buffer passed is always the buffer 
returned.
So, is it worth the change?
