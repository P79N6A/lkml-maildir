The reliability seems to be appropriate to the common use. I'm doubious 
that computer storage was a big design factor until the last few years. 
A good argument for buying large sizes, they are more likely to be 
recent design.

They do well in such use, if you equate battery death to pulling the 
card (it may not be). I have tested that feature and not had a failure 
of any but the last item. Clearly not recommended, but sometimes 
unplanned needs arise.

The recent technology announcements from Intel are encouraging in that 
respect.
