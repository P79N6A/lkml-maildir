Yes that is my drive, but after it scans the scsi bus and finds all the
devices it will not mount any of the partitions. And I know it is not
corrupted partitions because they mount fine under 2.4.18 using the
sym53c8xx driver.
I don't have the exact message in front of me, but when I try to manually
mount the partitions under 2.6.2 I get errors something about parity errors,
again I could get the exact message when I get home tonight.

Isn't this your drive?

If not, could you also post the relevant part of your 2.4 boot log for
comparison? If it is, maybe just the enumeration has changed, so, that now
you have to mount it under a different letter?
