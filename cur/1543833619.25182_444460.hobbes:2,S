I've actually spent some thought on that recently. The motivation
came from someone who wanted the number of CPUs in a fast way 
to tune AMD64 memcpy etc. better.
My proposal was to supply four new count:
number of cores, number of siblings, number of sockets, number of nodes
These all fit easily in 16bit so it would be 2 new entries in the
aux vector (128 bit total). Shouldn't be much overhead to write this.
If you need more exact topology you can probably eat the overhead
of parsing /proc/cpuinfo or read it from sysfs (or just use libnuma
which supplies most of this in an easy way) 
Doing it in a vDSO would be in theory ok for me too, except that x86-64
doesn't have one so far. Even in vDSO I wouldn't add much more than this
(like bitmaps and similar) because otherwise cpu/node hotplug could be racy.
Also I'm reluctant to redo /proc/cpuinfo and /sys for this.
