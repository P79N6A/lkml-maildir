Unfortunately, this is not going to work. It would work only if the only app 
that has to send SCSI commands were cdrecord. Then really, a non-setuid 
program just would not be able to get a R/W fd, and setuid ones are assumed 
to be trusted.
The problem is that many CD audio players also send SCSI commands in order to 
extract digital audio data. Are you proposing to make them setuid root? use a 
well-defined setuid helper? other solution?
