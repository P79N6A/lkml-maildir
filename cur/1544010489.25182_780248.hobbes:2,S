Signalfd is a wakeup gate available to the poll/select/epoll subsystems.
Signals that are queued inside the kernel, get de-queueing behavior, while 
signals that are overlapping, get overlapping behavior.
The code above enable you to wait for signals inside a poll/select/epoll 
dispatch loop, and get all the info waitpid() can return to you - w/out 
missing anything.
In a real app case, you're probably waiting for more than simple SIGCHLD, 
so you likely will have one (or more) read(2) of the signalfd to find out 
which signal you got, and do the waitpid(WNOHANG) loop in case of SIGCHLD.
