typical blocking point is waiting for page completion, not
__wait_request(). But, this is really not an issue, NR_REQUESTS can be
increased anytime. If NR_REQUESTS is large enough then think of it as the
'absolute upper limit of doing IO', and think of the blocking as 'the
kernel pulling the brakes'.
[overhead of 512-byte bhs in the raw IO code is an artificial problem of
the raw IO code.]
