I think the reason which comes to mind is avoiding future problems. By
having a single POSIX mode flag not only does the program not have to know
about setting the "right" other bits today, but if we find that POSIX
behaviour is needed in some other area in the future, the program doesn't
need to be modified and recompiled, because the POSIX behaviour "is in
there" for all things.
Ideally a program could execute some make-Linux-run-POSIX in init, and
have the expected behaviour everywhere without all manner of ifdefs.
I think that's a stronger argument, avoiding future problems is nice, like
wearing Kevlar sox if you shoot yourself in the foot a lot.
