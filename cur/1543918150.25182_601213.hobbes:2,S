blktrace (the utility) was running too - so the relay buffere /were/
being read and stored out to disk elsewhere.

I'd have to write a utility to enable the traces, but then not read. Let
me think about that.

Yep - when I get some time, I'll look into that. [Clearly not a gating

Again, when I get some time! :-)
