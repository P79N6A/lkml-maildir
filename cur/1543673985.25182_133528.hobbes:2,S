> how is it different from what automounter does?
Autofs works by creating a special filesystem above the vfs layer, and passing 
requests and data back and forth.   Submount actually does much less than 
this- it puts a special filesystem underneath the real one, and the only 
things it returns to the VFS layer are error messages.  It handles no IO 
operations whatsoever.
Peter Anvin has called using the automounter for removeable media "abuse."
Submount is designed for it.
