Hello,
I have a problem with my 2.2.10 on my smp mashine (gigabyte bxds, 2x
pentium2,full-scsi system)
2.2.10 refuses the use of my ps/2 mouse
2.2.10 says after booting that it has (minor) fs faults ... well fixable but
annoying
2.2.9 did NOT have those misbehaviors (and all kernels I use are compiled by
myself :) )
any help?   -- please cc me, because I do not subscribe this list (too much
traffic)
thnx
