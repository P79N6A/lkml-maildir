User must not call copy_from_user() in the handler, since preemption is
disabled and the copy_from_user might cause a page fault that might
sleep if the user page is not in the memory. Although the latest patch
posted on lkml tries to fixup the exception, it may some
times not succeed and the data collected might be incorrect.

Also from the above stack trace, looks like you had a int3 elsewhere(in printk)
also when jsys_open() was executed.
