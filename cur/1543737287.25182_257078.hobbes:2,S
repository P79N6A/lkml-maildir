Good news, when I did the following:
# dmsetup create test
0 54138987 linear /dev/sda1 0
54138987 40965687 linear /dev/sda3 0
# mount /dev/mapper/test /mnt/d
# ls /mnt/d
... it worked!
(the same with sda4 + sda2 volume, i've taken numbers from ldminfo output)
Maybe it's worth to update Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt :)
