Ignore these 'errors', they are really warnings - your drive doesn't
recognise some commands being sent to it.
2.4.20 will also show these messages.

Not sure about these, though.  I suspect that commands that only
relate to disk devices are being sent to your CD-ROM drives, but
somebody else will probably confirm/deny that.
