Looking some more, the fact that the oops happens in filemap_sync_pte()
definitely means that we haven't gotten around to truncating the sucker
yet. So invalidate_inode_pages() looks like the more likely cause,
especially as the page writeback correctly increases the file count for
NFS, so we should never be able to get into the horror-schenario of
having write-back after the pages have been truncated due to the inode
getting cleared.
Does the simple added test for page counts to invalidate_inode_pages()
fix the problem for you, Russell?
