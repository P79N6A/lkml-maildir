Things have changed then since the beginning of this year. As anyone
can see in the threads I referred to, you have done your best to deny
that the crashes and system hangs were caused by LIO, although I had
posted exact instructions on how to reproduce the bugs. Regarding
kernel integration and subsystem maintainership: one of the important
tasks of a maintainer is to verify whether reported bugs are
reproducible, and if so, to resolve them. I'm happy none of the
current kernel maintainers has the habitude of denying bug reports
that are 100% reproducible and which contain exact instructions about
how to reproduce the bug.

You are going off topic -- the above statement has nothing to do with
this thread.
Regarding the statement itself: it's incorrect to quote that sentence
out of its context. In that thread, as anyone can see who looks up the
URL, I was using the word copies to refer to transfers between
hardware and RAM, not to copying data from RAM to RAM. Looking at that
statement now I agree that that was misleading, and that I should have
written that statement in another way.
Do you think people like it to discuss with you when you try to make
them appear ridiculous all the time ?
And what I do not understand is that you are playing games with the CC
list all of the time. It's considered impolite to leave out people
from a CC list unless someone asked explicitly to be left out.
Bart.
