Well, the claim 'completed' is not entirely true.
It is missing 5 or 11 syscall numbers (platform depending) by which
applications could reach the new interfaces already coded in to support
the really LARGE files.  (And thus no libc support exists yet, I must
talk with Drepper et.al.)
A thing I am interested at which everybody can help is:
	Does having this new modified page cache/LFS stuff in break
	anything which is now running just fine with standard kernel ?
Some additional questions I have about things in various filesystems
which Linux has integrated.  I did modify something so fundamental
that ALL filesystems got affected.  Experts on filesystems other than
EXT2 should have a carefull look at those changes.   (EXT2 seems to work,
but 24h of moderate use isn't yet a severe stress test..  UFS contained
several things which I suspect were errors, but I can't be sure..)
The diff based on linux-2.1.132-pre-4  can be found at directory:
	  
ftp://mea.tmt.tele.fi/linux/LFS/
Once 2.1.132 arrives, I will make a diff against it, too.
