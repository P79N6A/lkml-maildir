I'll second, third, or whatever place I have in the squawk line, this 
squawk, bttv has been working just fine with the former config 
settings.  I'm on 2.6.9, but when I went to watch a little tv 
tonight, tvtime had a blue screen, saying it couldn't 
open /dev/video0.  An lsmod didn't show videodev or bttv and the 
modules do not exist in /lib/modules/2.6.9/kernel/*.  I don't have 
any firmware to load, so this patch below needs to be reverted.
