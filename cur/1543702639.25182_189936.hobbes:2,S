hi!
you don't have to change your fstab, there should everything ok with you
fstab.
you should change the root= entry in your grub configuration to your
actual root partition. if you don't know what partition your root is on,
do a 'df' and look where '/' is mounted on.
the second line of df output should read somewhat similar to:
/dev/sda2              4806936   1611232   2951516  36% /
that's my fileserver where /dev/sda2 is mounted as '/'.
your root= in grub config should read somewhat like this:
root=/dev/hda1)
