I don't use the preprocessor - after all, which -D should I give? all? none? a 
part? So my script just reads the files.
I know that my script could parse the #if's also - but that's a lot of work 
with little use.
How about that?
	#if defined(FORCE_ERRORS)
	        if (0) {
	#elif !DEBUG
	        if (kdebug) {
	#endif
	...
	#if !DEBUG || defined(FORCE_ERRORS)
	        }
	#endif
(seen in arch/ia64/sn/io/sn2/pcibr/pcibr_error.c: pcibr_pioerror() )
It's just too complex to look on the #if's and gives not enough advantages.
Regards,
Phil
