Note that such part is not the interesting part. It's not even necessary
right now to initialize the spinlock since the memset was just set it to
zero correctly also in stock 2.3.48pre1.
The interesting part is the interrupt code that was doing:
	interrupt()
	{
		spin_lock();
		spin_lock(); /* deadlock */
;)
