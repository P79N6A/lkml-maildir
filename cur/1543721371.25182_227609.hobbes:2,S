agreed, and i did it in a similar way initially (by adding the clone
flags to wake_up_process()) but went for the smaller patch. The only
reason i pushed it into fork.c initially was to avoid having to change
dozens of other files (most of them in various architectures) that use
wake_up_process(). It wasnt (and still isnt) clear at all whether we
want to do any fork/clone-time balancing.
