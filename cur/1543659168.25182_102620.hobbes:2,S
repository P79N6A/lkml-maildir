You should not code to avoid a construction that's valid C.
Just use the control structure that comes natural.
Of course "if (c % 2) goto a;" is a crime, but things
like "if (!buffer) goto err_out_nomem;" are better because
the tell you why the code jumps here, it includes an implicit
comment.
if (buffer) {
	/* do stuff */
} else {
	return -ENOMEM;
}
just obscures the logic of the code.
Or look at it another way, if you dislike goto you should
crusade against conditional return as well.
