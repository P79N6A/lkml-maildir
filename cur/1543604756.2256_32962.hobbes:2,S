2.4.10-ac9 locks after 
	Console: colour VGA+ 80x25
	Unexpected IRQ trap at vector 75
	Calibrating delay loop ..
Only the reset button helps. 2.4.10-ac8 works perfectly, ac9 also
if I suppress the line "define_bool CONFIG_X86_PPRO_FENCE y".
Since nobody is complaining, I suppose i am doing something wrong.
My system: Abit BP6, 2 Celeron 433( not OC )
