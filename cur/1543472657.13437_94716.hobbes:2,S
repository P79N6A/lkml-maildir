Hi Andrea,
> Why should we change GPL?
In order to make a deal.  In exchange for that concession, we would
require IBM to free up some specific chunk of their software.
It's basic barter.  IBM would like it if we simply donated the copyrights
to our software to IBM and let them write the licenses.  We would
like it if IBM simply put all its source code under GPL immediately.
Neither side benefits from unilaterally *giving* things to the other side.
But both sides can benefit from an exchange.

I don't think so.  See below.

Me too, exactly what you said.
IBM wants to sell a version of Linux where everybody out there can do
what you and I and the other people here are doing now: read the source
code, play with it, learn from it, make our own patches, distribute our
patches to anyone who wants them, send our patches to Alan and Linus
for their consideration.  As long as IBM Linux covers these things,
I won't feel exploited if the owners of the Linux copyright or the FSF
issue a new license to suit IBM's desire to protect their patents.
And I will feel benefitted if it's part of a deal where IBM frees
up some of their commercial software.
