On the w83781d (and this is true for most similar chips), temp1 is the
chipset's own temperature, and temp2 and temp3 are remote temperatures.
What these remote sensors are configured to measure depends on your
motherboard. On a dual CPU system, I'd expect them to handle one CPU
each. If I am right, they you will want to edit /etc/sensors.conf for
proper labels and remove the "ignore temp3" statement that must be
there.
