Using eth1394 as primary network connection on this computer.
So switching to the new stack is currently not an option, or did I
missing something?
(I also have a firewire disk, but that is not used right now)

Looking that calltrace upwards, it seems replacing the
memset(dma->sglist,...) with sg_init_table(...) would fix the BUG_ON()
as that inits the SG_MAGIC. But I do not trust myself to fixing all
the iterators correctly to convert this completely to the new API.
What I noticed trying to find the definition of sg_dma_address() is
that all architectures seem to implement identical macros for
sg_dma_address() and sg_dma_length(). The only difference is that some
archs call their fields different.
But I stopped looking if unifiying all names was possible when I found
swiotlb_map_sg() in lib/swiotlb.c...
Why is there a comment about using "sg_dma_{address,length}(SG)" to
obtain the "appropriate dma address and length" when I see no instance
of this macros there? Instead there are direct accesses to sg->length
and sg->dma_length. And the field dma_length only exists in some
arches! (alpha, ia64, powerpc only if __powerpc64__ is defined,
sparc64 and the 64bit variant of x86)
On the other hand I can't find any other "iova_length" in the hole
tree apart from include/asm-parisc/scatterlist.h...
... so I can't really make sense of the sg mechanism and abstain from
trying to fix this myself.
