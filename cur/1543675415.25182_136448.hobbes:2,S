That might be nice - would it be possible for you to send me a patch? Or 
is there something I can pass to the kernel at boottime that will make it 
enable DMA? I've been experimenting with ide2=autotune hde=autotune etc 
and that doesn't seem to be working.
Thanks so much,

One thing I might do is just make the driver ignore the bios policy for
disk devices.
