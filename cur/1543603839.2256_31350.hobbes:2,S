My /var/log/messages is getting consistently flooded with these
messages:
   VFS: Disk change detected on device sr(11,1)
   VFS: Disk change detected on device sr(11,1)
   VFS: Disk change detected on device sr(11,0)
   VFS: Disk change detected on device sr(11,0)
Any idea why this is happening and what I can do to make it
shut up?  There is no CD in either drive.
