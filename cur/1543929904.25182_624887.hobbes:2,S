It's been discussed before.  Some of the solutions discussed:
 - Add something like PRI_RES which can be concatenated into a printk.
   Ugly.
 - Patch gcc to allow user-definable types.  I think OpenBSD has a patch
   for this.  Then we have to get that patch propagated to all the
   people who compile the kernel.  Unappetising.
 - Disable gcc's printk checking, teach sparse to typecheck printk.
   Most people don't run sparse yet.
