Greetings:
 We did a search on the net and found several related topics like PCI
device power management but we are 100% sure if this is what we are
looking for. Then, we would like to get some inputs from gurus like
you....
 We are working a PCI device driver on kernel 2.4 (Redhat 9) and
kernel 2.6 (Fedora) and we would like to power off then power on the
PCI device, which is manufactured by our company. Is it possible to do
that? Could you guys instrust me by
giving us the functions we have to call?
many thanks
