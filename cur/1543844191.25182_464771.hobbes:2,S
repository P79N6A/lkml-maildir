Look at the VM statistics please. We have detailed page statistics per 
zone these days. If there is anything missing then this would best be put 
into general functionality. When I looked at it, I saw page statistics 
that were replicating things that we already track per zone. All these 
would become available if a container is realized via a node and we would 
be using proven VM code.
