I also have a similar problem, when running setiathome with priority 1.
All _running_ applications remain interactive, anything requring disk
access, in particular starting a new program, causes things to block.
I've so far only been in X when this happens, mouse still moves, remote
applications update their windows fine, no lost keystrokes, it's when I
run something locally requiring disk IO.
Renicing setiathome to -19 causes the problem to vanish.
Dragging an xterm around seems to help it recover from a hang too.

Running setiathome with priority one seems to do it for me.
