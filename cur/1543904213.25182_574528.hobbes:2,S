Sounds like it doesn't work:
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2007-02/msg00107.html
    [The] programmer won't get optimization he wants as after inlining this as
    after inlining this attribute information becomes completely lost.
    What about __builtin_trap?
    It results in int 6 that might not be applicable, but adding some control
    over it to i386 backend is definitly an option.

It seems like if __BUG() is not inlined, you get the bogus noreturn does
return warning.  If it is inlined, then you lose the noreturn attribute and
un-reachable code paths aren't eliminated.  Adding __builtin_trap after the
asm might be an ok fix.  It will emit a spurious int 6, but that won't even be
reached since the asm doesn't return, and it probably be less extra code than
the loop.
