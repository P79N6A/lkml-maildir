Dear diary, on Sat, Sep 23, 2006 at 08:00:23PM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> said that...

  Actually, this didn't catch on very well anyway, I guess because most
people just know it's GPLv2 and don't even bother to peek at COPYING, we
are a bit sloppy about copyright notices and most of them don't mention
licence at all (if there are any in the file at all), and adding
explicit copyright notices to mails isn't too popular either.
	$ git grep 'discretion'
	COPYING:        at the discretion of Linus.
	git-annotate.perl:# at the discretion of Linus Torvalds.
	git-relink.perl:# Later versions of the GPL at the discretion of Linus Torvalds
	git-request-pull.sh:# at the discretion of Linus Torvalds.
and I've found no patches with such special assignment.
  I think people don't really want to bother with thinking too much
about licences at all unless absolutely necessary, they just want to do
the fun part (coding). :-)
