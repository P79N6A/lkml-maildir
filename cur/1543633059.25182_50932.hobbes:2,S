It does not print decoded structure, it shows it in raw format, 64-128
bytes, just to avoid userspace parsing /dev/mem because of matroxfb 
did it already (and matroxfb needs PINS to properly initialize Gx50 
cards in non-PC hardware). And it may be non-trivial to get PINS from
userspace at all because of BIOSes may be disabled by firmware 
(and f.e. on my PC they are disabled for secondary adapters, so 
simple parsing /dev/mem leads to nowhere because of BIOS is hidden).
Besides that, it lives in complete separate file, so it is easy
to add/remove it.
