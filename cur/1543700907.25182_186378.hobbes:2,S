Yes, but it would be possible to optimize it some way on our
beloved hash tables ;) (By marking the entry read-only in the
hash instead of evicting it). Maybe not worth the pain though...

Ok, figured that out.

Except that we may expect all "referencing" PTEs to have the accessed
bit cleared, no ? Or if we have lots of users we'll end up getting lots
of positive results while after the page was actually referenced... I
don't know if this would be a real problem though.

Ok, right now, Anton is testing a patch from paulus where we do our
own flush batching and do the flush inside ptep_test_and_clear_* That
will at least fix the problem for us now.
Ben.
