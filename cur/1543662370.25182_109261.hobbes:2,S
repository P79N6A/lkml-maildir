It appears if I disable IBM's OS PnP BIOS support. I get no more conflicts
with the SB card. As for the ISA PnP USRobotics modem, I can't tell if it
works or not.
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
ttyS2 at I/O 0x3e8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
We report duplicate IRQs for COM1/COM2 however, the IBM BIOS *REFUSES*
all conflicts and will not allow shared communication ports. This is
bogus.
BIOS has this set:
ttyS0 = IRQ 4
ttyS1 = IRQ 3
-
ttyS2 = Determined by PnP
