IMHO, it should be the other way around, and more like two years, then you
can buy back time at something like 1/12th full BK license price per month
that you want less than the two years. Two years would be more appropriate
since you need to make sure that coders who've worked on the other SCM
before are well and truly out of touch with the code when they go back.
With that scheme, if you have a serious business case for writing a new
SCM *today* you just have to factor an extra cost into your plans (double
BK license), and if you want to work on an open source one, you just have
to wait while BitMover gets another two years on their head-start. Now
only people with determined plans can switch from using BK to working on
an SCM, and BitMover can get new users benefiting from their kindness and
lifting their market penetration as easily as possible.
