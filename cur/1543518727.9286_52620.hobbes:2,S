I agree. If you look at the description of EINTR, that is quite clear.

You really don't want job control to be implemented in the scheduler! It
should be implemented in the joc control code on syscall/trap return. I
know there isn't such code at the moment but that is why you are seeing the
problems :-)

I don't see this as an advantage. Stop signals should stop the process from
advancing in user space. You don't need to do anything to them while they
are in the kernel.
