Hi all,
I was reading the documentation for the Linux kernel framebuffer
device and it said "IMPORTANT: For 2.1.x kernels, go into the
Code Maturity Level menu, and enable the prompt for development
andor incomplete drivers. This is no longer necessary for the
2.2.x kernels."
In particular the last sentance where it says for 2.2 that the
frame buffer is not longer developmental. I have used 2.2.5,
2.2.9, and 2.2.10 and do not see the frame buffer device
anywhere, UNLESS I enable the 'prompt for development...'
option. Is the framebuffer (Intel platform) still developmental,
or is this an oversite? Or am I missing the boat here completely
on this one?
Joe
