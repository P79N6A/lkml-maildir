Because you need to umount /proc/fs/nfsd.
Note: you'll also need to restart rpc.idmapd.
Try the following:
service nfs start # which load everything that's needed
service nfs stop
service rpcidmapd stop
umount /proc/fs/nfsd
rmmod nfsd
Then to (safely) reinstall the module
insmod /tmp/nfsd.ko
mount -t nfsd nfsd /proc/fs/nfsd
service nfs start (which also will start rpcidmapd on FC boxes)
