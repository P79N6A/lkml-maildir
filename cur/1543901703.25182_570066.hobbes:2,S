	Yes, it will prevent the filesystem with the executable file from being
unmounted. Do you have an example where the original filesystem urgently
needs to be unmounted while this unusual executable is running? Or is
umount -l sufficient here?

	Yes, I'm aware of at least one example where this technique has
legitimate uses: libhugetlbfs. I'm interested in testing others you may
be able to recommend as well.
	Furthermore, in your example the VMA walk would make /proc/self/exe a
symlink to the file that backs the next executable VMA: libc, libdl,
etc. That seems rather odd to me. In contrast, with my
patch /proc/self/exe would always be a symlink to the original
executable.
