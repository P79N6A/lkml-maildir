Ah, this sounds like you want a special feature (ioctl or whatever) that
will allow accessing beyond the end of what Linux sees as the end of the
device? I don't think this will ever happen - you can get Linux to see
the whole space (even beyond what's reported by the drive), you can get
Linux to see the extra space as a different device, but I don't believe
it is reasonable to have an extra API for this kind of accesses.
