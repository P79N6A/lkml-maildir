IDE is very different. Its like calling NFS Netware. The upper layer
behaviour is fairly similar, and both ATAPI and USB mass storage is SCSI
alike (note if its not SCSI like its not USB mass storage its something else
eg a vendor specific driver).
Making other drivers appear to be scsi is coming from two things - 
#1 to avoid the Linus idiocy with major numbers
#2 its the sane way to do it on NT
For the 2.5 tree once the devicefs stuff is in this gets less and less sane.
With the high performance block layer work Jens has done going via scsi
emulation becomes a really dumb performance choice.
