I tried starting uml with and without the patch, five times each.
Without the patch it worked fine every time, with the patch it
instantly rebooted every time. Nothing was logged on netconsole.
Perhaps also interesting is that if I revert all patches after
this change up to HEAD, it doesn't always instantly reboot, but
sometimes just hangs. When using HEAD, it rebooted each time so far.
