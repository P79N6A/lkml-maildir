Subject: Etherworks3 driver now obsolete?

Hi all.
I decided to try a shiny new 2.4.0 kernel but I couldn't configure the driver
for my etherworks3 ISA ethernet card (AMD K6III PC hardware).
A bit of grepping showed that it only appears if CONFIG_OBSOLETE is defined
but nothing in the configuration tools seems to set it (at least for i386).
CONFIG_OBSOLETE is checked for by Config.in for a couple of drivers (net and
char), but the only place it seems to be defined is for the ARM architecture. 
Is this deliberate? Are some of the older drivers to be phased out?
Should there be a "bool 'Prompt for obsolete code/drivers' CONFIG_OBSOLETE"
in the config.in for other architectures, too?
Thanks.
