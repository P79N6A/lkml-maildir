But the idea that the kernel should exist as a kind of onion,
depicted by child college professors in their children's coloring
books is wrong. The optimum operating system will always be the
one that performs its functions in the most expedient way, not
the one that is the "prettiest" or easiest to understand. There
can't be any such thing as a "layering violation".
Layering is wrong. However modularizing, although it may
have some negative effects, has many redeeming values. It
allows for the removal of dead code, code that will never
function in a particular system.
