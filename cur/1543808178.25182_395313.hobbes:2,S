Nobody speaks about using /dev/hd* for all that, just about that
there always will be a /dev/something corresponding to the device.
Also, as you have mentioned /dev/hd*, it seems that you consider
all these devices connected over ATAPI. Again an exercise in mythical
zoology as in the ATAPI tape example.
				Have a nice fortnight
