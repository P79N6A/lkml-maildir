I'll put forward my configuration manager _again_. It can do or can aid with a
lot of what David Hinds wants to do, I think.
Also for Linus's requirements, the PnP bit can be removed and left as several
implementations in just the half a dozen or so drivers that actually make use
of it (Yuk!).
As for what David Hinds wants:

#1  Can't be done as a query yet, but auto-configure with IRQ-share-flag not
    set can handle it.
#2  Can't be done as a query yet, but auto-configure handles DMA channels
    exclusively anyway
#3  Auto-configuration does this for memory space
#4  Auto-configuration does this for IO space

Has support for PnP-BIOS, and adds appropriate device/bus definitions into the
melting pot for this interface. (It also has ISA-PnP support).

The auto-configuration tool that comes with my configuration manager handles
this - you tell it what IRQ's a device can use, and it does its best to find a
configuration that doesn't conflict with any other drivers it knows about,
subject to sharing constraints. The most suprising thing about this bit of
code (in my opinion) is how little memory it actually takes.

My configuration manager does the best it can... It can't do anything about
devices and I/O port ranges it knows absolutely nothing about, but it can
shuffle such ranges as it does know about around to get the best fit.
