Greetings,
Minor annoyance with 2.2.1 vanilla:  I mounted a slightly scratched CDROM
in my Sony CDU920S SCSI CDROM drive and kmod only half-inserted the sr_mod
module (leaving it "uninitialized"), putting insmod into D state.  Could
not kill insmod (obviously) nor rmmod the half-inserted module.  This
prevented me from using the drive for anything until I rebooted.
System is DEC Alpha, Avanti vector.
thanks,
-bp
