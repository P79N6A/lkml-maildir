Thanks for the input.  
With CONFIG_SMP=n, CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y (instead of 64G), 
and the printk from that thread it boots with:
megaraid: v1.18 (Release Date: Thu Oct 11 15:02:53 EDT 2001)
megaraid: no BIOS enabled.
scsi5 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
Attached scsi generic sg2 at scsi0, channel 0, id 6, lun 0,  type 3
..
mount had returned -6
ext3
VFS: Cannot open root device "806" or 08:06
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:06
