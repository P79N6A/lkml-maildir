While its possible to smooth out the leapsecond (which would be useful
to many folks), the problem is one's system would then diverge from UTC
for that leapsecond. 
The idea he's proposing here is to keep both UTC and UTS as separate
clock ids, allowing apps to choose which standard (well, I UTS isn't
quite a standard) they want to follow.
I think this would be quite useful, as I've seen a number of requests
where users don't want the leapsecond inconsistency, and others where
they need to strictly follow UTC.
I think having TAI would be nice too, but that requires quite a bit of
infrastructure work (NTP distributing absolute leapsecond counts, etc).
