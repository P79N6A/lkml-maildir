Ok, let's try again. :)
Why are you detaching the kobject from struct module?
In my patch I accounted for the kobject's reference count in the module
reference count (just not the count exported to userspace, as to not
break the userspace tools.)  So if a user has a module sysfs file open
(like the "refcount" file), the module reference count is incremented
and the module is not allowed to be unloaded until that count drops.
This removes any race condition with the kobject being in use when the
module structure is freed.
Does that make sense?

The attribute "refcount" is "owned" by the module itself.  The kobject
count is incremented if the file is opened by the sysfs core, thus
preventing the module from being able to be unloaded.
The same thing will happen for module paramaters.  They are owned by the
module structure as well.
It all "just works" :)

But my patch prevented that from ever happening.  If someone grabbed the
kobject, the module could not be unloaded.  That fixes all kinds of
races.

But whose patch to build on, mine, or your version?  :)
