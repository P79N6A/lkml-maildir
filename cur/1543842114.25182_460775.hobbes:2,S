That seems to be code that isn't upstream. 2.6.18-rc5-mm1 as well as
Linus' current git tree have this:
/*
 * If lockdep is enabled then we use the non-preemption spin-ops
 * even on CONFIG_PREEMPT, because lockdep assumes that interrupts are
 * not re-enabled during lock-acquire (which the preempt-spin-ops do):
 */
#if !defined(CONFIG_PREEMPT) || !defined(CONFIG_SMP) || \
        defined(CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING)
And yes, using CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC instead of CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING fixes
this for me :)
