Please name another planet where your controlling principle is proven to even
exist.
For a being that is located on a "very small stage in a vast cosmic arena"
(Carl Sagan) you have a very strong opinion about the big picture. How come you
think you are able to _see_ it at all? 
Wouldn't it be more accurate to simply admit, we _can't_ see it (at least
currently) and therefore it must be referred to as _random_? Obviously nobody
is hindered to try to find more pixels of the big picture. But shouldn't one
keep in mind that the picture is possibly _very_ big, compared to oneself and
the levels of complexity we are adjusted to.
A dropped stone is possibly only falling _down_ relative to _your_ personal
point of view.

Stephan
