Because I am getting crazy with nfs, I did following tests and the results
are out of my understanding:
I tried the next fcntl function in different nfs clients:
fcntl(fd, F_SETLK, &fl struct..) where l_type= F_RDLCK
and I've got the following results in a file which was stored in a nfs
server (2.0.36).
	- In the original server, OK.
	- In a 2.0.36 nfs client, OK.
	- In a 2.2.1 client, BAD!!!!????
The three machines have user space nfsd v2.2b37 
Am I missing something?
Thanks.
