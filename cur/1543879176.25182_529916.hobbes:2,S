The reason why we are storing it associated with the file pointer
instead of the page/block is because the a filename insertion might
cause a node split, in which case half of the 4k block gets copied to
another block.  We need a stable pointer to where we are in the tree
that can cope with hash collisions, and that's the reason for creating
red/black tree in the first place, since it *doesn't* get split and
reorganized when the directory's hash tree gets reorg'ed.  So
attaching the tree to the page breaks the reason why we have the
separate data structure in the first place.

Is it really that complex?  The simplest way of handling it is simply
keeping a open directory fd cache in a per-filesystem rbtree index
which is indexed by file handle and contains the file pointer.  When
you unexport the filesystem, you simply walk the rbtree and close all
of the file descriptors; no callback is required.
The caching hueristics are an issue; but fixed-size cache with a
simple LFU replacement strategy isn't all that complex to implement.
If 95% of the time, the readdir's come in quick succession, even a
small cache will probably provide huge performance gains, and
increaing the cache size past some critical point will probably only
provide marginal improvements.

Actually, no, we can't keep the collision chain count stable across a
create/delete even while the tree is cached.  At least, not without
storing a huge amount of state associated with each page.  (It would
be a lot more work than simply having nfsd keep a fd cache for
directory streams ;-).
If we need create/delete stability, probably our only sane
implementation choice is to just stick with a 63-bit hash, and cross
our fingers and hope for the best.  
If nfsd caches the last N used directory caches, where N is roughly
proportional to the number of active clients, and the clients all only
use the last cookie returned in the readdir entry (since it would be
stupid to use one of the earlier ones and request the server to
re-send something which the client already has), at least in the
absense of telldir/seekdir calls, then that might be quite sufficient,
even if we return multiple direntory entries which contain hash
collisions to the client.  As long as the directory fd is cached, and
the client just uses the last cookie to fetch the next batch of
dirents, we'll be fine.
