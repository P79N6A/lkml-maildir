Hello all,
reiserfs has to do a few odd tail conversion steps during direct io. 
Picture a file whose size is currently 3500 bytes, and a direct io write
extending it to 4096 bytes.
reiserfs will have those 3500 bytes packed into a tail, and when it gets
a get_block call with create == 1, it will convert the tail into a full
block and return the newly created block.
The new generic_direct_IO code doesn't send create == 1 to get_block
unless the new block is entirely past eof.  I think it should instead
allow any part of the block to be past eof, which allows reiserfs to
properly convert the tail:
