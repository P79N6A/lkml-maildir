I don't generally like changing syntactic stuff without a reason.
A good reason is when the original maintainer is not that active any more,
and a new maintainer (or even just random fixer) feels that they need to
run indent on the sources in order to make them more readable before 
doign a fix.
It happens, but not very often. Alan and Al both do it to the files they 
clean up. But I don't like having it done "just because" - there should be 
a real underlying reason.
