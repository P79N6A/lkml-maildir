Is there actually a way to work out what version of userspace utilities
you are using?
I read Changes and it tells me that I need pcmcia-cs 3.1.21 (for
test10-final).  It also tells me I can find out the version using
cardmgr -V.
Yet whenever I build the pcmcia utils it grabs the version from
the kernel tree (include/pcmcia/version.h) and not from the file under
pcmcia-3.1.21 (in config.mk kernel is before local include dir).
Hence the bizarre result:
[huggie@langly /usr/src]$ pcmcia-cs-3.1.21/cardmgr/cardmgr -V
cardmgr version 3.1.22
(kernel's version.h is 3.1.22).
Um, is this normal, good, right and proper?
Does the version in Changes really mean "you should recompile
{cardmgr,cardctl} with each kernel"?
