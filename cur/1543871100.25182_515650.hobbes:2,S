Indeed.

Yes, I understood that after I had sent my post...  And yes, I would  
agree.  If glibc already does this there does not appear to be any  
value in just moving existing functionality into the kernel.  Simply  
let "dumb" file systems return ENOSYS and let glibc do it...  And any  
FS which can do it better can implement the function and then glibc  
should not go anywhere near it.
Best regards,
