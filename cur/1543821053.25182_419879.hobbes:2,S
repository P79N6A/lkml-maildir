In the general case, not really. Just install git.
There's a 'combined' tree containing both hdrcleanup-2.6 and
hdrinstall-2.6 tree at git://git.infradead.org/headers-2.6
I have just taken a diff of that and put it at
http://david.woodhou.se/headers-diff.patch
 but in general that won't be
up to date.
It should also be in the next -mm tree too.
