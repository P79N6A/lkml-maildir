because I'm unconscionably lazy, and the VAX simulator code is already
written to use pcap and I'd rather not rewrite it, why fix something when
a quick hack will suffice :-)
my long term plan is too ethertap the simulator alright.. but moving along
the Linux/VAX project is primary, fixing simulator isn't :-)
I'm just wondering why dummy just do that bit more.. design decision? or
nobodys ever bothered?
Dave.
