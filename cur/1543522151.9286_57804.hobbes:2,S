Which is what I am doing now.  glibc 2.1.something has a generic
syscall(number, parms, ...) function which make life very easy when it
exists.  Do not bother changing the kernel, this problem only affects a
few userspace utilities that (a) use syscalls and (b) want pic and (c)
the library does not have the syscalls defined.
