Module dependency checking in userspace has always been racy.  A is
being loaded and needs a symbol from B.  B was loaded at the start of
insmod so the symbol was resolved.  By the time A is actually loaded, B
has been removed, userspace race.  This is checked for in
sys_init_module()
	printk(KERN_ERR "init_module: found dependency that is "
			"(no longer?) a module.\n");
Making some of the external references weak makes no difference.
Either they are resolved to a module by insmod and checked by
sys_init_module() or insmod replaces the reference with NULL.
