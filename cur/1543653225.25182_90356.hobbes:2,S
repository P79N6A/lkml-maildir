Hello all,
	Please, help me with the following: I have the PCMCIA adapter which converts the ATA compatible PCMCIA cassettes into "True IDE hard disk".
	My RedHat 7.3 linux works fine, when it was booted with the cassette inserted. I can mount/read/write/unmount the device without any error.
	Next, I unmount the device and extract the cassette - usually (not always)I receive the "spurious interrupt" message. Then, when I insert the cassette and try to mount it back, I receive the following errors:
---------
[root@leonp] mount /dev/hdc1 /mnt/pcmcia
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 2
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 4
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 6
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 0
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 2
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 4
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 6
 unable to read partition table
mount: error while guessing file system type
------------
These messages are repeated several times.
I also tried to issue hdparm -U (or -R) 0 /dev/hdc with exactly the same result.
Any help will be highly appreciated.
