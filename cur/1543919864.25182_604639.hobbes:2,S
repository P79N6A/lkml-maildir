/me wondering: what if you pass it on upstream to Linus, since:
1. it applies cleanly now
2. is pretty trivial
and forget it about it forever :). It seems the place this
patch touches is the only place where kobject_* and sysfs_create_* etc. error
codes are not being handled in contrast to all those functions which have been declared
__must_check?
