Subject: Error trying to mount cdrom after 2.6.4

Something strange is happening since i migrated from 2.4.25 to 2.6.4.
I cannot mount my cd-rom just after boot. (The cd-rom works fine in 
2.4.25 and works on Windows, so it's not problem with device). In many 
cases, if I open my fstab and delete something, close, re-open and 
rewrite what I deleted, and close again, works (I don't know why!). In 
others I just have to waiting a fews hours to be able to mount my device.
The dmesg shows me:
ide-cd: cmd 0x28 timed out
hdd: DMA timeout retry
hdd: timeout waiting for DMA
hdd: command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdd: command error: error=0x50
end_request: I/O error, dev hdd, sector 18446744073707859296
isofs_fill_super: bread failed, dev=hdd, iso_blknum=16, block=16
my fstab is:
/dev/cdrom      /mnt/cdrom      iso9660         users,noauto,ro         
0   0
/dev/cdrom is a link for /dev/hdd

ide-cdrom version 4.61
ide-disk version 1.18
cd-rom model:
LG CD-RW CED-8080B
