Yup, which is why I feel that the eventual solution may involve a hybrid
solution: a file system "driver" plus ample VFS support.  The question will
always be how much should go into the VFS and how much should go into the
f/s driver?  Our approach w/ unionfs had been to keep as much of it into the
f/s driver, and slowly offer VFS-level support, so as not to perturb the VFS
too much all at once.  That way we can offer users something that works now,
and internally change the implementation with minimal user-visible changes.
