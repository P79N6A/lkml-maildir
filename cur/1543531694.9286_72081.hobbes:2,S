fix the hardware switch so that it doesn't switch off power supply
for the keyboard even only for a short time:
directly connect ground from one/more PC inlets to keyboard outlet
and connect one/more power supply pins from PC keyboard inlet
with a diode or each inlet to avoid short-circuits between 
power supply lines of different PCs.
