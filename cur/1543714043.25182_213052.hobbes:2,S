It does that already.  But that thread is parented by keventd.  This was
done to avoid all the various nasty things which can happen when you have a
kernel thread and a hotplug helper which are parented by a random userspace
process.  All the crap which it might have inherited: uid?  gid?  signals? 
nice?  rtprio?  rlimits?  namespace?
The deadlock opportunity occurs during the call_usermodehelper() handoff to
keventd, which is synchronous.
2-3 years back I did have a call_usermodehelper() which was fully async. 
It was pretty unpleasant because of the need to atomically allocate
arbitrary amounts of memory to hold the argv[] and endp[] arrays, to pass
them between a couple of threads and to then correctly free it all up
again.
