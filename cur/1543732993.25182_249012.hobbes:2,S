you seem to be confusing 2 things.
The kernel<->userspace interface is supposed to be stable, and it should
be so that you can basically decouple X and kernel versions.
Within the kernel you should go for the best interface (where "best" is
a notion that is flexible over time) because 1) you can and 2) you are
suboptimal in both performance and maintenance if you don't
