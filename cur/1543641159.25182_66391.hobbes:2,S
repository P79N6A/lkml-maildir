I agree that hardcoding the resource numbers is bad.
Instead, I suggest the following:
s/bus->resource[0]/bus->io/
s/bus->resource[1]/bus->mem/
s/bus->resource[2]/bus->pref_mem/
s/bus->resource[3]//
There are only 3 _bus_ resources - the PCI works this way.
Please don't propose your arch specific hacks to generic code.
Ivan.
