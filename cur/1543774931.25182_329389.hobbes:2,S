i've also uploaded -50-27 in which i've improved the irq-flags debugging 
code. They are activated if CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT is enabled, and can 
come in two variants of kernel messages:
 BUG: bad raw irq-flag value 80000000, test/3810!
 BUG: bad soft irq-flag value 00000202, test/3810!
so we should now be able to detect mismatches of irq flags right where 
they occur.
