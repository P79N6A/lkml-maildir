I've checked and it contains the tc-arm.c.patch but does not have the ARM
mapping symbols fix. As recent kernels have fixes for that, its not so much
of a problem as it was however it should be staightforward to add into oe
and I will aim to do that.

You said nobody was willing/interested in maintaining a toolchain. I'm
saying that a toolchain is maintained within openembedded and that pointing
people at that is better than nothing. Maintaining a set of patches to
ensure bugs in binutils etc are fixed is easy within oe's framework. (To add
the above patch, in theory I just need to add a line to a file).

This is why openembedded exists - it tracks known working build
configurations of every bit of software needed to make complete linux
distributions.

I've written a quick and dirty set of instructions on setting up
openembedded below. Please note that oe is used for building complete linux
distributions so there is a lot of functionality being unused here (as you
can imagine from my statement above). bitbake is a known memory hog (it can
use up to 1GB of ram) - we all know this is appalling and a rewrite to
address this is in progress.
cd /work/
svn co svn://svn.berlios.de/bitbake/trunk/bitbake
export PATH=/work/bitbake/bin:$PATH
bk clone bk://openembedded.bkbits.net/openembeded
export BBPATH=/work/build:/work/openembedded
mkdir build
mkdir build/conf/
cp openembedded/conf/local.conf.sample build/conf/local.conf
Edit local.conf as appropriate. local.conf.sample has details about what
the variables do. My local.conf to generate the arm toolchain has:
DL_DIR="/work/sources"
BBFILES="/work/openembedded/packages/*/*.bb"
TARGET_ARCH="arm"
TARGET_OS="linux"
INHERIT="package_tar"
(everything else is left unchanged)
cd build
bitbake binutils-cross-sdk
bitbake gcc-cross-sdk
Output ends up in /work/build/tmp/deploy
