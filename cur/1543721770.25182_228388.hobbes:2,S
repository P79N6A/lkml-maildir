Well, I thought it was something like that.  So the problem could be
solved simply by rejigging ohci to export td_alloc and td_free as
overrideable methods?
Your map and unmap single could also be handled this way: with usb
specific overrides that default to dma_map_single.  None of this would
cause much perturbation in usb, and it would give you everthing you
need.
I assume your implementation of dma_map_single is simply to copy the
memory into the on chip area?

The DMA API is highly platform specific.  It basically embodies a
contract between the platform and its attached busses.  It wasn't
designed to embody a contract between two busses (or in this case, a bus
and its implementing driver).
