       think to be relevant):
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
I am sorry I didn't totally fill this out.  It seems enough especially
since the /proc/modules if found elsewhere.
I have been having problems with xmms (previously x11amp) all morning. 
It would suddenly stop working (note my computer has been on for
about... 17 hours) and I would have to close it and leave it closed for
a while (yes the process did terminate immediately) or else it would say
the /dev/dsp was busy.
I was listening to mp3s, writing an email, with an irssi (irc client)
session started a few minutes before but not watching it.  I heard some
disk activity and I lost the system.  Looking at the oops it seems X
died a horrible death and I shouldn't have rebooted (but the sysrq stuff
wasn't working).  I hope the oops help, I think it is similar to a
problem David already knows of and said he was working on.
