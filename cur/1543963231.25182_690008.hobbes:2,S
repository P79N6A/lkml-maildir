Indeed. If people want to know what the CPU itself reports, they should 
just use the "cpuid" instruction directly. The /proc/cpuinfo file has 
been a window into the kernels notion of what is going on, and disabling 
kernel features have disabled the bits in that file as appropriate (eg 
"clearcpuid=xyzzy" and "mem=nopentium" etc).
Of course, the *common* case is that the two will match 100% in features. 
But the kernel view has some of its very own set of CPU features too.
And it is possible that the "PAT as the kernel sees it" should be a 
*separate* bit from "PAT as the cpu itself reports to support it". We do 
that for quite a lot of the "synthesized" features, eg there is the "TSC" 
feature as the CPU reports it, and then we have the "CONSTANT_TSC" feature 
that is the kernel version of it that says that we have a TSC _and_ it 
runs at a constant rate too (or the "UP" bit, or the "Mfence synchronizes 
RDTSC" bit etc etc).
So it's possible that we should do the same thing for PAT - and allow 
people to see the CPU view _and_ the kernel view as two separate issues. 
In many ways that would be the logical thing to do. Hmm?
