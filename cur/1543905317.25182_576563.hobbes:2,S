Hi All,
Unfortunatly Sparc32 sun4c low level memory management apears to be 
incompatible with commit b6a2fea39318e43fee84fa7b0b90d68bed92d2ba
mm: variable length argument support.
For some reason, this commit corrupts the memory used by the low level 
context/pte handling ring buffers in arch/sparc/mm/sun4c (in 
add_ring_ordered, head->next becomes set to a NULL pointer).
I had a quick look at 
http://www.linux-mm.org
 to see if there were any 
diagrams that show what is going on in the memory management systems, to 
see if there was something that I could use to help me work out what is 
going on, but I could not see any.
Can any one help?
Regards
 	Mark Fortescue.
