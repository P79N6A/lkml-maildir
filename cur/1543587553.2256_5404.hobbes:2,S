Maybe, but 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 are still using the "old" killer algorithms
which can behave erratically.  I haven't looked at 2.2.x OOM killers at
all, so I don't know how they compare.  At some point in the near future, I
want to separate my patches out so they can receive individual attention
and hopefully get applied.
BTW, on this subject, if anyone sent me a mail which I haven't replied to,
I probably never got it due to e-mail problems with my ISP.  If it's still
relevant, please resend.
