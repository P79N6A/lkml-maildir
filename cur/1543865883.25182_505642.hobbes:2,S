 May I ask if you are refering to the Gujin structures under the
ROOT_EXTENSIVE_SEARCH compilation switch, or the
C structures describing the BIOS which could even be used
in the kernel?

 So without ROOT_EXTENSIVE_SEARCH defined.
 It is so usefull when you have loads of distributions...
 But yes, maybe that part should be in another file, maybe
 not a complete directory for a single file.
 There is also a special problem with ia32, the number of processor
 involved and their partial compatibilities, that Gujin try to help with.

 Last time I used this web interface it did not encode text files...
