Jeff, I've lost all of my patience.
All drivers are being converted this way.  I fought against doing it
to tg3 for various reasons, but the tide worked against me and I
accepted that.
We can't hold this patch up forever for a potential problem that you
don't have the resources to even test for more than a week.
I'm therefore adding this patch, and we'll fix or revert if the
"possible" IPMI problems do surface.
