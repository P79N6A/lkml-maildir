OK, that's good - from what you were saying it sounded like you had some
more fundamental objection.  Users are probably at least as important as
text documentation here since it's them that people tend to look at when
they need to look at code.  As with a lot of things the core isn't the
best thing to look at since it has to care about the things that it is
abstracting away from users.

The ability to adjust voltage is required for devices like MMC and CPU
frequency control so it needs to be implemented to at least some degree
and if we do it for everything it reduces the number of special cases to
handle.  Systems that don't need or want it can disable it by setting an
exact constraint in the platform code at which point it decays into a
safety feature.
