Hi,
I'm using pam-keyring[1] (a pam-module which launch gnome-keyring and
unlock it). The module fails with preempt kernel version 2.6.20 but
works with 2.6.20 without preempt enabled.
I have a look at the code of the module and the problem seems to come
from the value returned by WIFEXITED().
Is it possible that the problem comes from the kernel?
Regards
Laurent Bigonville
