There doesn't seem to be agpgart support in the 2.4.21 kernel for this
device.
Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 203M
agpgart: Unsupported Intel chipset (device id: 2570), you might want
to try agp_try_unsupported=1.
agpgart: no supported devices found.
Using modprobe agpgart agp_try_unsupported=1 seems to work but causes
general instability
during X load/reload on logout from my wm. It is my understanding that
this chipset is supported
in 2.6.x. Is there a backport planned?
