Andrew spotted this one...  ALSA needs to be using a standard kernel
primitive... semaphore maybe?  :)
include/sound/core.h:
> static inline void snd_power_lock(snd_card_t *card, int can_schedule)
> {
>         while (test_and_set_bit(0, &card->power_lock)) {
>                 if (can_schedule) {
>                         set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
>                         schedule_timeout(1);
>                 }
>         }
> }
Thanks much for all the ALSA work, as a [former] audio driver hacker, it
is a relief in many ways :)
