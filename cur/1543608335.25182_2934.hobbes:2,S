I couldn't see one. Do you know what name it would have or where I can
get the datasheet for it?
The ECS K75S5A motherboard is built around a SiS735 chipset with
integrated sound, called a SiS7012 by SiS. According to
http://www.sis.com/support/driver/audio.htm
 one MS-Windows driver
covers the chipsets SiS635, SiS735, SiS633, and SiS733.
There allegedly exist non-free Linux drivers from OSS called the
SiS7012. 
The PCI dump for the sound part is
/proc/pci:
  Bus  0, device   2, function  7:
    Multimedia audio controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] SiS7012 PCI Audio Accelerator (rev 160).
      IRQ 11.
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=52.Max Lat=11.
      I/O at 0xdc00 [0xdcff].
      I/O at 0xd800 [0xd83f].
/sbin/lspci  -v:
