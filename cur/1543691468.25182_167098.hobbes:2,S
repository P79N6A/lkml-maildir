The patch is nice and small, but I'm still not sure if we really want
input devices to have different modes, changing 'under hands' when one
process switches the mode while another is having the device open.
Things will then break.
I'd really prefer to contain the ugliness in mousedev.c, which then
could be removed completely in 2.8 or so, when XFree and GPM is already
well adapted to the event interface.
