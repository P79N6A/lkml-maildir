Blech.
Of course, I could just declare the new symbols weak, and stick
get_unmapped_area_mem() and mem_bdi in their own file which would be
conditional on !CONFIG_MMU.

Yes.  For the moment, nothing in MMU world actually looks at these
capabilities, though perhaps they should.

Perhaps... or perhaps it should have different capabilities if there's an MMU.
Is doing a private mapping of /dev/mem a valid thing to do anyway, even if
there is an MMU?
