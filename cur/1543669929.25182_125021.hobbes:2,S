So basically, neither the existing EXTRAVERSION nor my new FIXLEVEL
are checked. Any code could potentially break with -ac1 to -ac2 or
with .1 to .2.
Did anyone experience such problems with -ac already? There are far
more changes in -ac than there are in your patch.
Driver compilation should not be an issue. Change the Makefile and
version.h should be changed as well, so any code depending on
version.h will be rebuild, whether necessary or not.
Module load sounds unrealistic for .[123...], as you shouldn't change
any interfaces with fixes. But it might be a real problem for -ac.
