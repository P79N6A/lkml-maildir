Me too! We've posted about 15 messages to this list about
how mediocre Linux' packet capture routines are. We've put
stuff in the documentation, and we've done everything except
deliberately _force_ our software not to be able to build
on Linux. Why? Because there are always people who try it
and then post:
>I have installed NFR on Linux and it appears to keep missing packets 
>even on my low bandwidth network.
We're sorry it doesn't work well but it's Linux' problem,
not ours. :( Linux is a fine operating system, yaddayaddayadda
but its packet capture code is pathetic. Read it and weep.
>My issue is whether to consider NFR a mission critical tool
Linux isn't a "mission critical" operating system, is the problem.
That's why we've gone out on a limb and risked pissing off the
faceless hordes of Linux fanatics by telling them that their
favorite O/S can't run with the big dogs. Try one of the BSD
derivatives, read the release notes, and you'll have less
problems.
On the other topic, Mudge's filters are a bit buggy (the
current versions) and he's in the process of furiously
writing N-code as we speak.
