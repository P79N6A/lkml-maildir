I'm having some pretty major stability issues with 2.6.5 right now.
The   error consistently occurs when backing up using rsnapshot/rsync  
to backup partitions. It is rather reproducible.
This happens both with rsync in daemon mode, as well as rsync over  
NFS. Happened once after a 450mb upload through
a customer's xml-rpc application, which would have been written  
through a webserver, onto an NFS partition.
The only useful log messages I've ever gotten during a crash, only  
going to the console, are :
  hde: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x24
When the crash occurs, the server responds to pings, and tcp sockets  
remain open.
My operating environment is:
Hardware:
HP DL145 G2, Single & Dual Opteron 246s
Dual 80gb Maxtor drives or Dual 400gb Western Digital drives
Software/Configuration
SLES 9 SP2 x86_64

boot options:     append = "resume=/dev/rootvg/swaplv selinux=0

All partitions, except for /boot, and swap, are reiserfs, on top of
