I could see a benefit to tainting the kernel once userspace starts 
poking at the hardware directly.  That way at least we'd know that a 
crash might be due to userspace doing bad things.
For instance, consider the case where userspace misprograms a DMA 
engine, which starts overwriting random kernel memory.
