Weird.  Tried any more recent kernels?

No such thing on ARMs.  If you take a fault while handling one, you
re-enter the fault handler - you don't reboot.
Alternatively, you could send the ARM Linux mailing lists/me a binary
to try on various other ARM machines/kernels.  (see
http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/armlinux/mailinglists.php
)
(Note, I'm unlikely to get time to try it here, between trying to get
2.5.15 working, trying to review patches people have sent over the
last two weeks, maybe actually applying some of them, sending stuff
to Linus, finding and killing bugs, tackling the odd hardware failure,
updating my web diary, and maybe even producing an ARM patch for
something later than 2.5.10-rmk1 which was released a fortnight last
Sunday ago.) ;(
