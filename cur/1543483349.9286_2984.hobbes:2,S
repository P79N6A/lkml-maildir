Hi,
  I've noticed what seems to be a bug in the SMBfs page write code. It seems
that the code in generic_file_write has changed fairly recently, and
it is now a bug for the 'updatepage' code to clear the page lock and
serve the wait queue. Unfortunately nobody seems to have removed the
call to 'smb_unlock_page(page)' in 'smb_writepage_sync'.
  Would people who've been seeing problems with the smbfs client in
2.2.1 please try the appended one-liner and see if it works?
  BTW: The reason I noticed this bug is because I actually wanted to revert
to the old behaviour for the NFS write-clustering project. Since the
smbfs and NFS clients are the only filesystems to use
'generic_file_write', we might instead want to revert
NFS+generic_file_write?
Cheers,
  Trond
