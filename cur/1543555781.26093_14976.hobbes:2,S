I leave "debugging" enabled in the drivers I submit. This allows me to
tell customers who are having "It won't detect my card" problems to
enable the debugging output. Most of the time this leads to a resolution
within minutes of me getting the debugging output log. 
Sure it will slow the driver down a bit, because of all those bit-test
instructions in the driver. If it bothers you, you get to turn it
off. If you are capable of that, you are also capable enough to turn
it back on when neccesary.
The debug asserts that trigger during normal operation are what make
the Linux kernel stable. Problems get spotted at an early
stage. Problems get fixed. Microsoft disables all debugging before
shipping stuff. That means they don't get useful bugreports from the
field ("When I do this, the system sometimes locks...." compared to
"my system crashes with: 'panic: sk buff underrun at 0xc0123456'"). 
This was discussed and a decision was taken that we're on the good
track around 5 years ago. I guess that there is some new blood to be
convinced nowadays...
