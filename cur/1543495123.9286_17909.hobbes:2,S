So, then what do you do when one of the systems catches fire, falls over,
then sinks into the swamp?  Do you lose access to its data, or is the data
some how replicated on the other machines?  If there is replication, then
how do you arbitrate access to the replicated versions (to prevent access to
stale data) and how do you handle failover?
