Your email can at an opportune time for me...  I was starting to try
2.6.28-rt on ARM and quickly came to the conclusion that the arch
patches weren't the focus yet.  But I'm currently side-tracked with
getting my board to even boot a vanilla 2.6.28 kernel first.  Do
you expect to get to the arches in the next week or two?  If not,
I may head down that path for ARM myself.
Thanks!
