Sure. It does a partial checksum of various IP fragments when they
are being assembled. By starting with 0 as the input parameter,
and the entire length of the IP packet, you calculate the whole
checksum. It's output has to be shifted into a short, added to the
low word of the result, then inverted, to complete the TCP/IP
checksum.
It was believed that partial checksumming during various stages
of IP packet assembly would improve performance. It is possible
that performance would be improved if the checksum was done only once,
though, because there is a lot of overhead in setting up pointers and
counters prior to calculating the checksum. However, the kind of
"performance" we are talking about is probably nothing that would
actually improve network I/O. That is currently limited by the Ethernet
devices. However, some CPU cycles could be saved.
