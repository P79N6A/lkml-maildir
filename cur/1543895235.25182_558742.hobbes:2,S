But this is not tivoization.
Tivoization is a manufacturer using technical measures to prevent the
user from tampering (*) with the device, *while* keeping the ability
to tamper with it changes itself.
(*) tampering brings in negative connotations that I'd rather avoid,
but since that was the term you used, and the term "modifying" might
bring in legal-based technicalities such as that replacing isn't
modification, I just went with it.
So, given a proper definition, do you know any law that requires
tivoization?
Taking it further, do you know whether any such law requires
*worldwide* tivoization, as in, applying the restrictions in the law
even outside its own jurisdiction?
