Guys (and list),
I have back-ported the ppdev code (support for user-space parallel port
device drivers) to 2.2.10, in such a way that it is self-contained.
Just as in 2.3, it allows programs to open("/dev/parport0") and perform
ioctls to claim/release the port, examine/set the data, status, and
control lines, as well as perform IEEE 1284 negotiation and data/address
transfers.  In 2.2.10-ppdev1, however, all transfers are software-driven;
DMA/FIFO support is only in 2.3.
The ppdev code supercedes ppuser-0.8.
It should be relatively easy to add the parallel printer console to
ppdev-2.2.10, in the same way that lp does it in 2.3.
Get it while you still can:
