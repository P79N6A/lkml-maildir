If you want to notify another CPU that you want the spinlock, then you 
need to set the "flag" variable _outside_ of the spinlock.
Spinlocks are not fair, not by a long shot. They never have been, and they 
never will. Fairness would be extremely expensive indeed.

It depends entirely on the cache coherency protocol. I bet you'd find 
differences even within Intel CPU's.
