hm. Signals themselves can be handled easily i believe - setup_frame()
modifies not only regs->eip and regs->esp but also regs->edi and regs->ebp
[the two registers carrying the SYSEXIT return EIP and ESP]. Is there any
problem to be expected here?
sigreturn can be handled by generating a SYSENTER on the stack, instead of
the 'popl %eax ; movl $,%eax ; int $0x80' we do currently.

Hm, these non-glibc entry points in fact are very interesting because it
can be done without changing glibc.

SS is destroyed and overwritten with the kernel SS by SYSENTER - i dont
think we could get around that. Can we require user-space to save any
potential fancy extra segments before doing a fastcall?
