Its all funky games that no other driver is doing...  There is one 
guaranteed to work scenario -- set all masks and bounce limits etc. to 
32-bit.  There is also one highly-likely-to-work scenario, disabling 
ADMA by default.

The former implies we need to disable swncq for 2.6.24, if it's not 
stable yet.
