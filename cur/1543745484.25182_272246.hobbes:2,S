If anyone has the USB Vendor/Product IDs (VID/PID) for these errant devices, a 
negative report (maybe including a link back to Greg's post in the 
Linux-USB-Devel list archives [http://
marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=110079963113076&w=2]) should be 
submitted to the USB 'Working Devices' list for RS-232/USB adapters at:
   
http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdevcat.php?id=12
(I just did a search at that location for 'CP2102' and 'Silicon' and 'SiLabs' 
and found no entries for any such devices. I don't see any USB VID/PID info 
about them or their devices in the 'usb.ids' file either.)
That might help keep future users away from the devices of a company with such 
a poorly-thought-out policy.
Thank you, Greg, for alerting us to this situation.
