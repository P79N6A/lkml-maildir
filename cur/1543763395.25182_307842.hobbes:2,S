I can put it into the NFS client stream which feeds into the -mm kernel.
That will enable me to queue up the NFSv4 patches that depend on it
too...

I thought I'd do that in a separate patch since the aio workqueue is
currently statically defined in aio.c.

iosem_lock_and_schedule_function() will always be called with the
iosem->wait.lock held, since it is a waitqueue notification function.
In practice it is called by iosem_unlock(). The call to wake_up_locked()
will trigger a call to __wake_up_common() which again tries the
notification function of each waiter on the queue until it finds one
that succeeds.
