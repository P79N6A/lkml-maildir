Subject: [DVB patch 00/11] B2C2 / FlexCop driver rewrite

Hi Andrew,
the following patchset adds a refactored driver for
DVB PCI cards and USB devices based on the FlexCopII
or FlexCopIII chips by B2C2. It consists of the
following parts:
- drop the abandoned attempt to add USB support based on the
  existing skystar2 driver
- add a modular flexcop driver
- a bunch of fixes for the new driver from CVS
The second patch is probably too large to make it to
the list (130K) but I see no reasonable way to split it.
Just in case, it is also available here:
http://linuxtv.org/downloads/patches/2.6.12-rc4-2/quilt/dvb-b2c2-refactoring.patch
This driver has been in CVS for two months so I
believe it is quite stable by now, and IMHO good for 2.6.12.
Please apply.
Thanks,
Johannes
