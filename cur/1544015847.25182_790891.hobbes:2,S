ah, ok - that's fine.
I was just wondering whether it was two CPUs crashing at once and 
producing an overlap - or something like that. (although typically in that 
case we dont get such nice line duplication - we get totally garbled 
output of the two oopses superimposed.)
It's just that when an oops looks weird we have to look at every small 
detail, to be able to imagine the unimaginable.
Bugs you cannot even imagine are the toughest nuts usually, as the process 
of debugging narrows imagination usually - often it involves repetitive 
automatisms which are not helpful in expanding your thoughts to cover 
tricky, unusual bugs.
If an oops looks difficult there's a way out of that trap: co-debug in 
duos if you can - the same folks rarely get unimaginative for the very 
same detail. (Or put it aside and leave it for the next morning - to flush 
out the invisible temporary mental dead-ends one has installed 
subconsciously and which are blocking you from reaching the real 
solution.)
