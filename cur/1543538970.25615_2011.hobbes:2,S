Yes, No and I understand.
AT&T System V had stdin/stdout/stderr defined as if the following were used:
const FILE *stdin = &STDIN;
static FILE STDIN = {....};
This ment that the default stdin/stdout.... were constants and could not
be modified.
HOWEVER, the release 2 manpage suggested that for portability all
I/O should go through a file pointer defined as:
FILE *input = stdin;
Then you COULD replace the default input by
   altinput = fopen(...);
   input = altinput;
The other note is that the manpage goes back to BSD in 1993. I don't think
the library functions implimenting fopen/fclose ... have remained the same.
At the time the man page was written the standard I/O library created the
file pointer from something like:
static FILE	io[MAXFILECOUNT];
static int	nextfile = 0;
....
FILE * fopen(char *path, char * mode)
{
	...
	initialization for io[nextfile]
	io[nextfile] = open(path, intflags);
	...
	if (io[nextfile] >= 0)
	    return(&io[nextfile++]);
	return(NULL);
}
This allows the manpage to be correct, since the structure pointed to by
the FILE * variable is never deallocated. It is also NOT thread safe.
ALSO NOTE - this does not conflict with the "const FILE *stdin.." shown
earlier. stdin/stdout/stderr were not part of this array.
I don't think stdio library works that way anymore.
MAXFILECOUNT was 16 to 32 at the time, and multi-threaded I/O did not exist.
I think the manpage needs to be rewritten.
