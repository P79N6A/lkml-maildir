And in most of the cases it is used is constant for the waitqueue anyway
or appears to be (eg the tty patch). I don't think we should be stacking
extra parameters on all those zillions of calls made all over the kernel
and for no purpose - so the existing wakeup functions should stay as is
for performance as well as for size (which due to cache pressure is
performance).
