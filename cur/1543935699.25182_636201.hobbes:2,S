I'm sorry, but I didn't feel this was important, as I didn't expect the cleanup
effect to cause much debate...

Yes. And the unidentified feature is NLKD. But as with other notifiers (most
notably the module unload one), all reasonable kernel debuggers should
need them (or do explicit patching of the mentioned source files). As I
explained before, I think that if kernel debuggers aren't allowed into the
tree, they should at least be allowed to co-exist (since the argument of
requiring in-tree users and submitting code for mainline inclusion is void
if political/personal reasons exclude certain code from even being
considered for inclusion).
