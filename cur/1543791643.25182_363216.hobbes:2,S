Does Linus's current tree fix this?  I ask, because I thought that:
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@g5.osdl.org>  2005-10-31 21:12:40
Committer: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@g5.osdl.org>  2005-10-31 21:12:40
Parent: 1e4c85f97fe26fbd70da12148b3992c0e00361fd (Revert "i386: move apic init in init_IRQs")
Child:  df70b17f88a4d1d8545d3569a1f6d28c6004f9e4 (Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/aia21/ntfs-2.6)
    Don't touch USB controller IO registers when they are disabled
    The USB "handoff" code is an early PCI quirk to make sure we own the USB
    controller (as opposed to the BIOS/SMM).  But if the controller isn't
    even enabled yet, don't try to access it.
    Acked-by: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org> (who had an alternate patch)
    Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>
Should have fixed this.  If not, please let me know.
thanks,
greg k-h
