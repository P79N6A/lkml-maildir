Hello!
I just did the normal routine: compile 2.3.99pre3-7, reboot, hang while
detecting cardbus slots :-(
Quick fix was to remove line 750 "{ PD(TI,1225), &ti_ops },".
As all of you already guessed, my laptop has an TI1225 (rev 01) cardbus
controller.
Hang was just after "Adding cardbus controller 0: Texas Instruments
PCI1225", just before showing the IRQ.
System is an Dell Inspiron 7500, with RedHat 6.1 + updates and pcmcia
version 3.1.13 (pcmcia-cs.20-Mar-00.tar.gz)
At hang-time no cards were inserted, nor did inserting one help. Any
suggestions to fix this?
Jeroen
