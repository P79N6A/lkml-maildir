Ok.  So basically what you need is a parent pointer or some other way
of getting the full sysctl_path.   All of the names that show up in /proc
are still present in the ctl_table.
Hmm.  In parse_table we actually call sysctl_perm at each path component,
I'm not doing that in proc_sysctl.c at the moment but that would be easy to
add.
I think I will look at adding the back pointers.  Adding the security
check during lookup is nice but it won't really give you the context
you could use.  There may be a point in adding a security check during
lookup as well, but I think the way the VFS works there are weird implications
there.
