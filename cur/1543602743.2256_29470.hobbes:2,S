 is the corporate website, and the particular product
is at

 .
The actual module is an implementation of the Rational (previously Atria)
ClearCase mvfs filesystem for Linux; it is composed of a source-available
translation layer, and a binary-only core.
One important note to mention: they only support Red Hat-supplied kernels;
there is a high chance of failure using it with a stock kernel, due to
changes in internal structures required by mvfs.
