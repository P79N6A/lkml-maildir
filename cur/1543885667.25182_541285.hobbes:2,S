Subject: [PATCH][RFC] Create a top-level "Space-critical features" menu.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/8/67

  i've always hated that lower-level menu under "General setup":
Configure standard kernel features (for small systems)  --->
which buries the choice of de-selecting features to save space one
level down without really explaining what it's all about.  so i just
shifted all of that up to the top under what i think is a more
meaningful name.
  this patch is also why i asked earlier why top-level menu entries
have no "help" text -- because, in this case, it would be useful for
someone looking at the config screen to see that choice and be able to
ask, "hey, i wonder what *that's* all about", and get help along the
lines of:
  "these features are normally selected but, if you're strapped for
space, such as with embedded systems, you might consider turning some
of them off.  if space isn't an issue, you might as well just leave
them as they are."  (or something like that.)
