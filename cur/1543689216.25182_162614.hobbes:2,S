It does not cause a problem just now.

Maybe it could not have happened, I'm not sure about exact
CONFIG_HIMEM semantics.

Okay, my point was that the patch was not exactly obvious. You said
that you have not changed any core functionality, and you may even be
right, but it broke somewhere in the middle of pretty non-obvious
changes.

No, at this point you are wrong. restore_processor_state() is only
run at resume. But you need to end atomic section during suspend,
too, so you don't sleep in it (causing so much warnings at console
that it takes forever to suspend).

Callers are under your control, and I don't want to trace your code
*that* closely. [This is my choice. if () return -EPERM; is not that
much different, but I prefer this one.]

Okay, this is nice trick and it might work. I've checked assembly on
both i386 and x86-64 and it looks okay.

Trying to fix error handling is good and welcome, but please test it
first. It already ate 3 different filesystems here (like "so damaged
fsck can't fix it", had to mke2fs), and I do not want it to take some
user filesystem.

Again, if that patch came by email and not ftp, you'd probably get
some gratitude.

Why does every email from you have to end with a flame?
