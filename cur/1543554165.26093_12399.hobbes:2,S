   One question here.  Is it important here that the # be consistant?
   I mean since to change a sysctl isn't the name the important bit?
   ie: dev.md.speed_limit would work regardless of if DEV_MD is 3 or
   4?
These nodes are accessible via both /proc/sys/* and the
sys_sysctl(...) system call, the latter uses the numbers
so they are hard coded into application binaries.
