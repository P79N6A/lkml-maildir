my interpretation of the bug would be that we fail to mask out the 
block-step MSR bit [because we mask out bit 25 instead of bit 1], and 
hence the bug would cause that MSR bit to stay enabled in other tasks 
too.
So in theory the bug should manifest itself as block-step mode never 
clearing itself, once activated. (but this would never leak into other 
tasks because we've got the thread.debugctlmsr abstraction that protects 
them)
