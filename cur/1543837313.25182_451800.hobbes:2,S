In that case could you post
cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU?/*
?
Perhaps we're losing ACPI C2/C3 state power saving, and checking
the busmaster activity indicators there would be useful, too.
Oh, in this context maybe it's actually a problem of a misbehaving driver?
An active USB mouse is known to distort ACPI power saving, causing reduced
notebook battery operation length (due to busmaster activity preventing
ACPI idling, I think). Now what if some certain driver actually caused
permanent busmaster activity...?
