Assuming the eepro100 is counting tx underruns like normal drivers, and these
are TX then yes - the Linux box is sourcing short frames,  the CRC on the cisco
is exactly what you would expect too.
The problem is - the short TX frames are almost certainly PCI bus access 
related. That is the chip can't get to main memory in time to get the bytes
it needs for the next piece of the packet before it empties its internal
FIFO.
So what on your bus has a PCI latency set to 240/248 ? 8)
