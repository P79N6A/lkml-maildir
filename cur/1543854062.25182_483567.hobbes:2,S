Of course but at this point the choice of the new VMA is already made
by the caller. So in our case do_munmap() decided that B is the new
one as you said. But I still don't see why...
And as I said previously it will end up by calling consecutively:
        vma->vm_ops->open(B)
        vma->vm_ops->close(B)

thanks for the link, but I don't expect to find out the answer to this
very specific question in it.
