No it won't because /proc/sys/kernel/sg-big-buff is not
writeable. Furthermore it is only visible when the sg
driver is compiled into the kernel (i.e. it is not a
module).
If you are talking about an sg (scsi generic) driver from
and including 2.2.6 then you can edit the
DEF_RESERVED_SIZE define in ../linux/include/scsi/sg.h
to a larger value. Then rebuild the kernel/module.
And if you are using a bleeding edge sg driver then you
can write:
echo 131072 > /proc/scsi/sg/def_reserved_size
to obtain the intended effect.
