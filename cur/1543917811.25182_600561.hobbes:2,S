My use case is: I want to do a nonblocking read on descriptor 0 (stdin).
It may be a pipe or a socket.
There may be other processes which share this descriptor with me,
I simply cannot know that. And they, too, may want to do reads on it.
I want to do nonblocking read in such a way that neither those other
processes will ever see fd switching to O_NONBLOCK and back, and
I also want to be safe from other processes doing the same.
I don't see how this can be done using standard unix primitives.
