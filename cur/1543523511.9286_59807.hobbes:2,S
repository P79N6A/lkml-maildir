I would like to suggest an alternate system call with, perhaps, more
useful semantics:
       pivot_root("new_root", "old_root");
This will detach the path "new_root" and turn it into the new root,
and *then* attach the *old* root, now detached, to the path
"old_root", which must be a valid mount point (i.e. directory) in the
new root.
For example, say that you have a ramdisk (initrd) as root, and you
just mounted your intended root at /newroot.  You could then do:
     mkdir("/newroot/initrd");
     pivot_root("/newroot", "/initrd");
     /* Now the initrd is mounted at /initrd, and the new root is / */
     /* Do stuff that involves the initrd */
     umount("/initrd");	       /* Done with it */
