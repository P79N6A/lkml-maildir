On my laptop, I get a lot of
Keyboard on ... reports too many keys pressed.
That may well be the case, I use my normal hands on a small
laptop-keyboard.
Why is that message printed? There nothing I can do about pressing
multiple keys by accident, so I don't think it's useful.
It does, however, frequently mess up the commandline, which leads to big
frustration.
Couldn't this be wrapped in #ifdef ATKBD_DEBUG or something? Is it
really necessary to see this message?
Good luck,
Jurriaan
