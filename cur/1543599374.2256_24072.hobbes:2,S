                Just collected all the facts in a bunch:
      1. There is a svgalib fast-action game called koules.
   Koules intro eventually delays by about 1/10 sec, and it is _visible_.
      2. Again these delays while playing music: mpg123+esd.
      3. Again these delays are in sync with gpm mouse stalls.
  I.e when sound stops for its 1/10 sec, mouse stops to respond too.
a) mpg123 is reniced at -20.
b) "find /" doesnt seem to affect this behaviour.
c) it is a somewhat flashing effect: one minute it triggers
  each 5 secs or so, next 10 minutes i do not see it.
d) CPU load is in its right limits.

cheers,
