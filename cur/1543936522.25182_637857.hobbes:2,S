Subject: checkpatch: add filename before the summary line
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

With the patch applied the output of checkpatch.pl is as follow:
./arch/arm/mach-footbridge/ebsa285-pci.c 
total: 1 errors, 0 warnings, 48 lines checked
Adding the file name allowed me to collects stats running:
	find . -name *.c |xargs ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --file |grep -B 1 total
but I though it might me useful for other purposes to add the file name
after the list of errors and warnings and before the summary,
when the list is long I find handy to print out the filename as a reminder.
