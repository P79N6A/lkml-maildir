Cool, you discovered a really subtle bug ;). Who knows how many random
crazy bug-report are been due this race?!? BTW, I think that also some
2.2.1 bug report/hang/lockups could be due recursive semaphores used as
no-recursive semaphores... maybe not... 
Well I thought a bit about your race and I think to have fixed it well
now. Note I also killed the recursive semaphores that are no longer needed
since 2.2.2-pre2 (thanks to kpiod). 
I also implemented a down_trylock() that looks OK to me, but I don't have
time to try it. Since now I am running with the patch applyed.
Here my patch that will fix your race and implements down_trylock(). It's
against 2.2.2-pre2 clean.
