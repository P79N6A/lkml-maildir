No, my point is that SCSI Core "development" isn't following any
spec or document or any formally accepted spec.
And as more and more transports are coming aboard, you see more
and more "kludge" from SPI making everything fit around the
SCSI Core's legacy SPI as _opposed_ to _evolving_ SCSI Core.

I've had private conversations _before_ I posted anything and those
were highly technical -- you know SAS stuff.

I have been, many times.
Absolutely no advice I've ever posted to linux-scsi has been accepted
ever, unless someone else implemented it.
Any advice I've ever posted have been SAM/SPC related.
