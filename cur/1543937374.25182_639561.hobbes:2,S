MemFree is the actual amount of free memory. Page reclaim and such
might, on memory pressure, free memory from cached, buffered and some
slabs that have shrinkers.

I'm somewhat confused as to what you're saying. How would anyone expect
MemFree to be memory that is _not_ freely available?
Or are you asking how to compute the amount of freeable memory, that is
memory that isn't currently free, but could be freed up under pressure?
If that is indeed your question, then yes, thats rather hard as slabinfo
and the like don't indicate which buckets have shrinkers (but even if
they would have shrinkers there is no guarantee they'd be able to shrink
100%)
