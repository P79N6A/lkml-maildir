CONFIG_X86_PAE without CONFIG_PARAVIRT is the case in question here.
What's done in that case can't break Xen because it doesn't run under
Xen.

ISTR you describing this method earlier. This is what I had in mind
for fixing up Xen not to need full PAGE_SIZE-sized pgd's.

No, it's identical. clameter's code makes PAGE_SIZE-sized pgd's
unconditional for CONFIG_X86_PAE, which is what bothered me.

It doesn't need to be linked together for vmalloc_sync(). Just increment
the generation number and walk the mmlist the same as for pageattr.c
