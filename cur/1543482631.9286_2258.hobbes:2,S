    Kernel 2.2.0 destroyed filesystem
    I tried to upgrade my kernel from version 2.0.34 to 2.2.0, but this
    resulted in destruction of all linux partitions. This has happened
    previously on this same machine as I tested development kernels (2.1.126,
    2.1.128 and 2.2.0-pre8) using Red Hat 5.0 and Debian hamm. This time I
    first upgraded all the software recommended in Documentation/Changes,
    although it didn't make any difference in the end.
    I've never run into this problem using series 2.0-kernels.
    Bootup stopped in kernel panic: 
    ---
    Partition check:
     hda:hda: set_multmode: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
    hda: set_mutlmode: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
     hda1 hda2 < hda5 hda6 hda7 hda8 >
    EXT2-fs error (device 03:06): ext2_check_descriptors: Inode bitmap for
    group 1 not in group (block 0!)
    EXT2-fs: group descriptors corrupted !
There were changes in ide-disk.c that would enable mult_mode
(under conditions differing from what we had earlier).
There is (or was in recent 2.2.0preX kernels, I have no
kernel source nearby right now) an #if 0 (or #if 1) that you
can change to #if 1 (or #if 0), and see if that helps.
[Search for multmode, the context will be clear.]
For at least one person that solved his problems.
