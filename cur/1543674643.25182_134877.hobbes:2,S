Hello Christoph,

That's ok for me, although I don't know what the exact criteria for 
adding a function to kernel.h are.

These are both fine IMHO.

I only copied the function from videodev.c and renamed it, so please 
don't blame me for the way stuff is done there. 8-)
Perhaps Gerd Knorr or Alan Cox can comment on your changes -- I'll have 
to investigate if all of these arguments are used anyway.

Is it possible to fix the definitons of the v4l ioctls instead without 
breaking binary compatiblity?

Since this function is always used in user context and the memory is 
always freed afterwards, it should be possible to use vmalloc() or a 
static buffer (what's the maximum size?) instead.

Agreed.
CU
