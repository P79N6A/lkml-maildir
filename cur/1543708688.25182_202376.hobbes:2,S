Subject: harddisk speed: 2.4.24 20+% faster then 2.6.3

I've been checking, rechecking but cannot explain
why a "vannilla" debian install kernel (sid-testing install
cdrom) is faster then "Feisty Dunnart" on the same hardware.
hardware: Mini-itx with 1Ghz via-C3
200GB udma harddisk.
2.4.24:  
 Timing buffered disk reads:  150 MB in  3.01 seconds =  49.83 MB/sec
2.6.3 (vanilla):
 Timing buffered disk reads:  102 MB in  3.05 seconds =  33.40 MB/sec
2.6.3-mm4:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  108 MB in  3.00 seconds =  35.95 MB/sec
Bonnie tests confirm this!
hdparm & bonnie & kern.log for comparison put at: 
http://dth.net/c3/
Anyone any idea *why* ?
Mayby i'm overlooking something (it's kind of late on this
side of the pond) but still...
Open for feedback.
Danny
