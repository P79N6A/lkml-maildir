It seems to help somewhat, but the problem is still visible.  Even v20.3 on 
2.6.22.5 didn't help.
It does look related to ia-boosting, so I turned off __update_curr like Roman 
mentioned, which had an enormous smoothing effect, but then nice levels 
completely break down and lockup the system.
There is another way to show the problem visually under X (vesa-driver), by 
starting 3 gears simultaneously, which after laying them out side-by-side 
need some settling time before smoothing out.  Without __update_curr it's 
absolutely smooth from the start.
Thanks!
