Using a standard PC floppy controller - yes.

Sure, you can do it on the Amiga as well, but not on a standard PC
floppy controller.

Well, you can probably do it with ST-506 interface hard disk, because
the data that goes in to that is more or less directly fed from the
head-amp, which is partly why it was so sensitive to cable length.
The closest you could probably get with any modern device would be
"read sector foo, and return data even if ECC appears to have
failed".
