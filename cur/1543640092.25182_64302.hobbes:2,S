the window for locking is really small (and will always be small), so it's
cheaper for the fastpath to implement this as a spinlock, with the
stack-user being the lock holder.

this is an unrelated issue from the user-vm-unlock thing. pthread_join()  
(the new, futex based variant) already uses a futex (well, internal
pthreads mutex that in turn uses a futex) which also stores the exit code,
so threads are always be created in a detached state. But there are cases
when this is unnecessery, eg. when a thread later on calls
pthread_detach().
