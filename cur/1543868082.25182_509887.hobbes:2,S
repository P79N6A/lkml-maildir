Thanks.
Well, then what about my way of doing generalization?
I.e. one-file shell script-let, rather many indistinguishable GNU make
files throughout source tree?
Sam's approach also offers using of CONGIG* options. But this has two
issues (for me, of course):
* lguest is in i386 arch, *top* Kbuild doing this for specific ARCH
(include/asm/);
* lguest wants to have private for-asm constants generated, unless CONFIG
is set, kbuild never will reach that directory.
Finally (my favorite). While i was told, that i'm doing more obfusticated
solutions, i doubt i did now: script-let makes magic more readable, and
GNU make's complications, like `$$' and various whitespace issues, do not
influence.
One thing is, that
+quiet_cmd_offsets = GEN     $@
+      cmd_offsets = $(srctree)/scripts/mkCconstants $< $@
+
can be moved in Kbuild.include with CONFIG* upgrade:
....
sed-$(CONFIG_MIPS) = mips
....
      cmd_offsets = $(srctree)/scripts/mkCconstants $< $@ $(sed-y)
Kind regards!
