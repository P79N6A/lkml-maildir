I think we want to avoid it even in 2.3.x - not only are there
potentially DMA-able areas in stack space (I know the driver I'm working
on - USB - has that behaviour), but I'd rather avoid having the TLB
impact of a mapped stack.  On many architectures (including the x86 due
to the 4M pages), it is cheaper to have a 1:1 mapping than to have
normal page mappings.

Yup.

It's not much worse to move it to the end: you do it with something like
this:
	get_current()
	{
		movl $0x1ffc,%edx
		orl %esp,%edx
		return %edx-(sizeof(struct task_struct)-4);
	}
and then the compiler most of the time can use a negative memory offset
to essentially create the same code as we have now.  The one real
downside is that instead of having a small positive offset you have a
larger negative one, which tends to take up more space.  We could work
around that by putting the commonly used stuff at the end of the struct
task_struct, but I'm not sure it is worth it. 
I considered doing it this way originally, I think I went with the
low-mem struct task_struct mainly because it was more obvious, and
because it can be cheaper. A high-mem struct task_struct has its own
advantages, though, so it's by no means a clear choice either way.
