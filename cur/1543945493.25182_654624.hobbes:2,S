Hi there,
We're having issues with our Adaptec RAID controller and I was
wondering if anyone would be able to advise on how to go about
resolving them. :)
The system:
RHEL 5.1 x86_64
Kernel 2.6.18-53.1.4.el5
aacraid 1.1-5[2437]-mh4 (The default module shipped with the RHEL kernel)
The controller:
Adaptec 3405 + BBU
BIOS : 5.2-0 (12415)
Firmware : 5.2-0 (12415)
Driver : 1.1-5 (2437)
Boot Flash : 5.2-0 (12415)
The disks:
4x Seagate ST373455SS (Firmware 0002) in a RAID10
The issue:
We continually get what seem to be adapter lockups with the error:
aacraid: Host adapter abort request (3,0,0,0)
aacraid: Host adapter reset request. SCSI hang ?
The controller hangs for a while, recovers, and everything continues normally.
We've tried a replacement controller and a replacement set of disks
(we swapped out all 4 disks) to no avail.
The problem seems (?) to happen during spikes of IO -- like when the
PostgreSQL autovacuum daemon kicks in. But not always.
From searching around LKML and Google, this seems to be a fairly
common issue, but I'm not quite clear on the cause (hardware?
software? firmware?) or the resolution.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
Regards,
Omar
