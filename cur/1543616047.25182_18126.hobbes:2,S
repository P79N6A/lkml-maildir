    Out of ignorance and laziness, where is it again that I can get this
    kernel?

    Funny, I went from a working 2.4.8-ac<x> to a non-working
    2.4.13+patches when I started getting these crashes. At first I
    thought they were Mysql, so I called them. They said "Re-install
    windows", er, I mean upgrade my kernel to 2.4.16, which would "fix
    the problem", so I did, and it didn't. So they said to go to
    2.4.17rc2 as that would fix my problem, only it didn't.

    Yeah, and build a debian package, distribute it to (looks behind me)
    100+ linux servers, including 6 mission critical heavily loaded DB
    machines. 
    Not to be a complete asswipe, but no. While I like playing with
    computers and all that, I don't have enough hours in the day to be
    rolling out new kernels every couple weeks and still have time left
    over to see my wife, shoot my guns, ride my motorcycles and drink my
    scotch.

    I understand completely, I'm just trying to figure out a way to test
    this that doesn't impact my site as drastically. See, we've only got
    two databases that will cause this fault, and of course they are the
    two most important ones, and the only way we can generate this fault
    is to put them live and wait for them to crash.

    There are 2 other patches I need to apply, the first is the LVM
    1.0.1 patch, and the second is the VFS-lock patch. We need these to
    do snapshots. Which isn't bad, but I'm about the only one still here 
    who can do it (violates hit-by-a-bus rule).
