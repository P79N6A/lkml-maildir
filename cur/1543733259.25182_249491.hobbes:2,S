heu hw_random and i8xx_tco use also the lpc bridge, but hopefully they
don't attach it.

That why I start a patch implementing acpi PnP, but nobody seem
interested :(

Heu, I don't understant why you need to deal with hotplug ?
PnP modules works like pci modules. You make a list of know id, and then
you call {pci,pnp}_{port,irq,dma}_{start,len,...} to access resource of
the device.
Hotplug is need like for pci modules to autoload it.
Also using the LPC brigde the alsa driver don't know about the io port
and irq resource you had to pass them via modules option.
For the gameport, alsa driver use a hardcode value of 0x200 that is
wrong on my computer (it is 0x201).
For the midi port it don't use the irq...
With PnP, the bios/acpi give theses resourse.
For the bit you had to write in the LPC for enable io port, I made a
little test and even if you writte bit that disable the io gameport it
still work. Moreover, I think the bios autoset these bits.
