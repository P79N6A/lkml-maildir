The thing you are missing is that you absolutely have to pin something
or you have multiple VFS races.  Your bitmap suggestion, while cute,
really shows a lack of understanding of the problem space.
dnotify had to do it, inotify has to do it.
Do you want to go down the lets-find-a-race path with Al Viro? ;-)

It is not the total size that is the concern, but the per-allocation
size, which has to be contiguous.  A first order allocation is hard to
do.  You can only find two contiguous free pages in physical memory so
often.
Inodes come from the slabcache.  NONE of this is an issue there.
Plus, as I have said, the slabcache is probably caching much of what you
are pinning.  So memory consumption is not changed.  Finally, these
numbers are WORST case.  Watch only a handful of files and you have a
handful of hundreds of bytes pinned.
