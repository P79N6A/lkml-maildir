In that case, let's add this to the help screens for the three device
types (CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV, CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV, CONFIG_INPUT_JOYDEV), 
after the current text:
For the drivers to link correctly, you must make the same selection (Y or
M) here as for the USB Human Interface Device (full HID) support.
Under CONFIG_USB_HID, likewise add after the current text:
For the drivers to link correctly, you must make the same selection (Y or
M) here as for Input core support.
That said, I suggest that Input core support menu be moved into the USB
support menu, where these dependency relations can be automated and made 
visible to the user. 
I apologize for not submitting a patch -- it's a skill I lack.
Cheers,
Peter.
