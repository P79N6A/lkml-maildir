I just want to make sure and there's the possibility of supplying only maxphy
and let the autoswitch algorithm decide...

Actually its possible to query them with mii and all non-present phy's
should "return" 0xffff. I wanted my changes to have no impact on pcnet
cards with only one phy, thats why.
