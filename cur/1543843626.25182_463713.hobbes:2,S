So this has to be changed. And requiring to recompile the kernel is the
wrong answer. Having some nifty tool, which allows you to define the set
of dynamic trace points or use a predefined one is the way to go.

Generalization like that are simply wrong. Static markup is not a
panacea. It might help for some things in the first place, but it is not
flexible enough in the long run. It is an engineering challenge to make
the "static" trace rules autogenerated by some means as Andrew pointed
out several times in this thread (see patch(1)), so we can provide a
useful ad hoc set for the users.

Stop whining! LTT did not manage to solve the problem in a generic,
mainline acceptable way. If you really believe that Kprobes / Systemtap
is just a $corporate maliciousness to kick you out of business, then I
really start to doubt your sanity.
This has nothing to do with postprocessing and tracepoint creation
tools. The postprocessing stuff is not in the scope of mainlining. Once
a halfways future proof interface is available, tools will come up
within no time. There are a lot of companies out there who have the
interest and the capabilites to do an intergration into Eclipse to name
one example. They will not start to spend a second of work time until
there is a consolidated instrumentation core in the kernel.
