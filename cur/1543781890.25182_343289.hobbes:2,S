Also, the use of n makes no sense. Indicates total sleep for 3
seconds, but actually sleep for 40 milliseconds 3*HZ times
(potentially)?
In any case, probably should be:
timeout = jiffies + 3*HZ;
spin_lock_irqsave(&lock, flags);
while (time_before(jiffies, timeout) && !midi_devs[dev]->outputc(dev, data)) {
     spin_unlock_irqrestore(&lock, flags);
     interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&seq_sleeper, msecs_to_jiffies(40));
     spin_lock_irqsave(&lock, flags);
}
spin_lock_irqrestore(&lock, flags);
Or something similar....
If those locks weren't there, we could use
wait_event_interruptible_timeout(). Should we create a locked version?
Thanks,
Nish
