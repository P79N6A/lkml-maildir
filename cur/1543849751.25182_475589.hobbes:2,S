Mostly... I don't have a 32-bit initrd environment for aic94xx, so I
gave it a spin with aic94xx built in and without firmware. It made it
as far as trying to mount the root device, and then sat there spitting
this out continously:
atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program might be trying
access hardware directly
I can put together a 32-bit initrd and try booting all the way if
it'll be a useful experiment, let me know.
Cheers,
Muli
