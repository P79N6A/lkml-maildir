	Really, it all matters what the application is.  One other good idea
is to have swap spread across multiple disks.  This will improve swap
performance.  My only gripe about swap under linux is that you can't have
more than 8 swap partitions, though I suppose you could use RAID-0 or
linear acroos a couple of partitions and make that one swap partition,
but generally the kernel does a better job handling disk access for swap
than a RAID setup would.
