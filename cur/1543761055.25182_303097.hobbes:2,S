the radeon security changes? I've gotten no bad feedback on those neither
has dri-devel, so I've assumed they were all fine (usually radeon bug
reports get back fairly quickly as everyone has one ..),
the multi-bridge stuff is definitely broken as I've seen radeon and r128
reports on it .. and it looks most like 2.6.11-bk2 broke things and I
haven't merged anything until -bk7 ...

I'd like to make it work I'm sure it is some thing small wrong, but I've
no access for > 1 week to my radeon machine so unless someone else picks
it up we may need to drop it for now..
