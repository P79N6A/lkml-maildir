Hi,
I'm trying 2.5.42 compiled with ACPI and OSS ISA-Pnp Soundblaster 16.
When playing audio, the sound is heavily chopped.
dmesg says:
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Routing Table [\_SB_.PCI0._PRT]
isapnp: Scanning for PnP cards...
isapnp: SB audio device quirk - increasing port range
isapnp: Card 'Creative SB16 PnP'
isapnp: 1 Plug & Play card detected total
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKB] enabled at IRQ 10
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] enabled at IRQ 5
[-cut-]

sb: Creative SB16 PnP detected
sb: ISAPnP reports 'Creative SB16 PnP' at i/o 0x220, irq 5, dma 1, 5
SB 4.13 detected OK (220)
sb: Interrupt test on IRQ5 failed - Probable IRQ conflict
<Sound Blaster 16 (4.13)> at 0x220 irq 5 dma 1,5
<Sound Blaster 16> at 0x330 irq 5 dma 0,0
sb: 1 Soundblaster PnP card(s) found.
Motherboard is Asus P5A.
Audio is compiled as a module
isapnp and ACPI are statically linked
With ALSA was even worse (no output at all).
After appending "pci=noapci" into lilo.conf, now OSS happily works
again without problems.  I haven't tried yet if ALSA too benefits
from pci=noapci.
Feel free to contact me if you need more info.
Regards,
Simone
