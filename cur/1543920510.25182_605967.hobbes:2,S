One other thing to note here, the proper operation of hot plug dictates that
if you boot your laptop with no adapter in the slot, you must first load
the driver in order for the new adapter interrupt to be captured.  So,
if you insert a card without the driver loaded, it will not be enumerated
by PCI until you remove it and the reinsert it.
