Sorry for the *really* late answer, but I did not have any time to do
linux things the last weeks. :-(

Until my last mail from 7. Jan this was true, that I was not able to
crash 2.6.24-rc6-mm1 with above patch.
But after testing 2.6.24-rc7 with only the IOMMU changes applied it
did crash once again.
After looking at the patch that seems rather expected as it only
touches powerpc code.
(I only looked at its diffstat after testing it, so I was not aware of
that fact during testing)

The resulting 2.6.24-rc7 kernel worked for me. I compiled 146 packages
without a crash.
Today I finally had some time for debugging again and tried the new
2.6.24-rc8-mm1.
The crash is still there, I will report that crash in current thread.
