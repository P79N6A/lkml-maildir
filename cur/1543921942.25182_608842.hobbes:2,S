I've been playing with this a bit in libata - it seems the pdc202xx is a
bit more complicated. An error doesn't stop the FIFO, a reset does.
The problem thus seems to be triggered ultimately by the fact we call the
timeout method before doing a FIFO drain in some cases, and also that old
IDE tries to use PIO to flush a DRQ when the failing taskfile is a DMA
operation not PIO..
