You're talking about <199907301842.UAA27011@dumburk.cendio.se>,
<199907301845.UAA27017@dumburk.cendio.se> and
<199907301849.UAA27023@dumburk.cendio.se>, right?  I had already flagged
so that I wouldn't forget them (in case one of the more important
developers didn't pick them up). Please don't think you're being ignored...
Although one gets used to really fast responses via email etc, the
time elapsed here has been just a week, and if you've been following
this thread (or was it the "ISDN and feature freeze" one) you'll have
read that Karsten (who's the Main Man as far as ISDN4linux is concerned)
was away until Friday.
Now the pressure is on getting a (mega) patch into order for
integration (as I'm sure you'll understand :-). While your suggested
changes look quite reasonable to me, I could understand if Karsten
doesn't want to simply drop it in before studying it a bit first...

Actually, Karsten was in Ireland last week for certifying an Eicon card
(which apparently succeeded...).

Please don't think that your efforts aren't appreciated. Have a bit more
patience and I'm sure things'll work out.
