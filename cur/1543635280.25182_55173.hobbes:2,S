Resync against latest Linus release, and start folding in some of
the bits that have accumulated whilst I've been at conferences.
I dropped the input layer changes, as the ones in my tree already
are known to be 'almost good'. They should just fall out over time
in the same way as the framebuffer changes.
As usual,..
Patch against 2.5.25 vanilla is available from:
