So about 4K extra.  In the kernel I built (tiger_defconfig) there
are 27 call-sites for __ia64_sync_icache_dcache ... so that amounts
to about 150 bytes each ... or close to 10 bundles.

These are all from normal-looking C code ... so RSE must be valid.
What other weird things might be be doing that would make it a
problem for the new code to make a function call?
