My patch doesn't remove cc-option-align, and it's still used in 
arch/i386/Makefile.cpu.
The point of my patch is that there's no reason why a user should set 
different align options (if a developer wants to benchmark different 
align options, adding them to the CFLAGS in the Makefile is still 
trivial).
