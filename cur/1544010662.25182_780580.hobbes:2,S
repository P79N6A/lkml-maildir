Why do you think it is wrong? This break stops the "hlist_for_each"
loop, not the enclosing "do while".
Actually, I don't understand why the compiler complains, and I never
saw a warning myself.
But the check is ugly indeed, that is why the patch was named "uglify ...".

Yes, this is obviously not what was intended. But afaics, this is
the only place which should be fixed?

We had the similar bug for IOPRIO_WHO_USER case, iirc. Probably
we can fix it the same way:
