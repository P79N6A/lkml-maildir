How does this work for filesystems like reisefs which do tail merging
and other filesystems which might do sub-clock allocation?
We either need more than one field (or a byte counter) + lock or
perhaps a generic fields + callback to the fs itself.

    Yes, I was thinking at this callback too. Such a callback is
    nearly the only support we need from the filesystem to provide
    allocate on flush.
I think a callback is the way to go.
