Unfortunately, this won't work, because the standard VGA text mode
uses funny tricks to convert 8x16 font bitmaps in memory to 9x16
bitmaps for real display (some graphic characters from the original
IBM charset are specially handled by the hardware).
However, for the framebuffer console (where we don't have hidden 9th
pixel column) this could be useful - it is certainly better to lose
high-intensity background (which almost nobody uses) than
high-intensity foreground (which is used much more often). Probably
this can be performed without actually inverting anything...
PS: I really use high-intensity background colors in VIM (though I
rarely run in in the console these days).
