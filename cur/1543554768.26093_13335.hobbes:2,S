Torsten Hilbrich posted a chroot "bug" that works on 2.2.17 and
2.2.18pre21, it's in de.comp.os.unix.networking, Subject containing
"chroot-Bug in Linux", dated 2000-11-15 20:38:38 local time (+0100).
Its Message-ID: <87bsvhgh4x.fsf_-_@myrkr.in-berlin.de>
It shows a program that saves the cwd -- open(".",...) in an open file,
then chroots to a newly made directory below that, fchdirs back to the
original open file (that is now outside the chroot) and calls upon
chdir("..").
Note that it's NOT related to the current working directory, but to an
open file outside the chroot.
Please comment.
