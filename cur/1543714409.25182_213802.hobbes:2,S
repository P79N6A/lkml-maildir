Hi,
I made several changes for cmpci.6.77, so the version is now 6.82.
The patch is mostly from kernel 2.6, which change to support newer gcc,
fix possible security hole. I also use the same include files for both
kernel versions.
The cmpci-6.82-patch2.4.tar.bz2 is made from official kernel 2.4.25, but should  be able to patch other 2.4 kernel.
The cmpci-6.82-patch2.6.tar.bz2 is from official kernel 2.6.5, it will
show error when patch cmpci.c for kernel 2.6.4 or earlier, that's ok.
Sincerely,
ChenLi Tien
