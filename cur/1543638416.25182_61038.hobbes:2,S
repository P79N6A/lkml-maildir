Yes, I'm well aware of this issue as ia64 has basically the same setup
in this regard.  For ia64, it seems to be acceptable to require
that AGP DMA operates in coherent mode, so that all the memory can be
mapped cacheable.  With old chipsets, coherent AGP DMA is slow, but
with more recent chipsets (including hp's zx1), there won't be a
performance penalty.  I realize that this isn't a solution for x86 as
there is too much of an installed base.
