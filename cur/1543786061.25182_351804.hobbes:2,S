That argument is specious, and raises the chance that someone will 
suggest that we learn from our mistakes.

Was this code first written in some language which compiles into C, like 
the original C++ compiler? It just "feels funny," which clearly is not 
an objective or quantitative thing, just an impression. Your comment 
"not _that_ awful" is a perfect example of "damned by faint praise." 
However, unless someone is willing to make the argument that the code is 
too weird to maintain, style isn't an issue, is it?
Christoph has made some clear technical points, those should be 
addressed, whether you like the code style or not.
