	But, do you do it incrementally? By which I mean: subtract
(appropriately) the old value of the octet from the existing checksum,
field in the packet then add (appropriately) the new value of the
octet to the checksum?  Simply recalculating the IP checksum from
scratch can generate a "correct" checksum for a packet that was
damaged*** while waiting around in memory.
	I don't know if people worry about this now, but 20 years ago
there was a fuss about it.  Further discussion offline, please.
