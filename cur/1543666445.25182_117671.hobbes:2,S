Actually, we have all that in the mainline.  It was the .h fallback to
mach-defaults.
The issue here is that mach-numaq and mach-summit are very PC like and
so don't need any of the hooks that are in setup.c, thus they'd like to
share setup.c from mach-default.  Likewise, they have the same topology
file, I think (although this time it would be different from
mach-default since we can pull the numa pieces out).  Prior to the build
changes, VPATH would solve this problem (I used to use it to get
trampoline.o for voyager).  However, now, the best I think we can do is
to cat the file across.
