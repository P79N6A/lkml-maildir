Hum, and you can quote me on that. I don't have that particular problem at
all, my problem is only with SMP. And on several machines I note that the
code to lock up SMP machines unless you use "noapic" isn't compatible with
2.4, haven't had the lockup yet. Wish that would migrate back to 2.4!
Anyway, my kernels are SMP, and if I boot "nosmp" they work fine with
every APIC in sight enabled. This may or may not be the same problem, you
could build an SMP kernel and boot it "nosmp" with APIC on and see what
that does (if you're curious).
