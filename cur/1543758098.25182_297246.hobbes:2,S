Right, but CONFIG_CKRM is a Y/N, rcfs can be a module which is loaded
or not, depending on whether someone actually wants to *use* classes
in CKRM.
In theory, distros could build with CKRM set to "Y" but leave RCFS
as a module to simplify testing.  It dosn't matter too much to me but
it seems like having the flexibility of leaving rcfs as a module
is a nice capability.
I'm willing to be hear all comments.  ;-)
