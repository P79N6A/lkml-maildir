Yes, though there is a reasonable chance that it can be made to work
with linux-2.6.0 and nfs-utils-1.1.0 (neither of which have been
released yet:-)
But I'm a big fan of auto-mounters - e.g. am-utils.
If you want a filesystem that is assembled from lots of bits of other
filesystem, describe it to am-utils and it will present it to you.
