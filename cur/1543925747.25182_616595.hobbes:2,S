That's plausible, but having two separate ways of tracking and
reporting the CPU usage of a cgroup seems wrong.
How bad would it be in your suggested case if you just give each
cgroup the same weight? So there would be fair scheduling between
cgroups, which seems as reasonable as any other choice in the event
that the CPU is contended.
