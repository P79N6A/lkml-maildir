OK this means you need "ip=::::::bootp" on your command-line. I didn't
spot it documented anywhere :-( and it wasn't obvious the default
behaviour had changed until I browsed patch-2.2.18 rather than the patched
file.
I'd still like the userspace bootpc to do the job though. It just grumbles
"sendto: network is unreachable."
