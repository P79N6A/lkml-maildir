Subject: [PATCH] Fix crash with irqpoll due to the IRQF_IRQPOLL flag
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/22/76

o System crashes if booted with irqpoll command line option.
o Problem happens because Inside note_interrupt() we are accessing
  desc->action->flag without taking the desc->lock. While accessing it
  somebody goes ahead and unregisters the irq handler hence desc->action
  is NULL. By the time note_interrupt() checks it, it crashes.
o In that system it is irq 4 seriving to serial driver.
o Take the desc->lock before accessing desc->action->flag.
