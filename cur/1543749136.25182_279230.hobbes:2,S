Been seeing this problem from time to time--
After running /sbin/reboot the following message (or similar) loops
continuously and the only way to recover is to hard reboot the system.
unregister_netdevice: waiting for ppp546 to become free. Usage count = 1
We are using "tc" to do traffic shaping with the tbf (tocket bucket
filter).  Kernel is 2.6.9.
I found the following which appears to be similar:

Except that it relates to cbq specifically.  Could there be an issue with
the tbf code as well?
