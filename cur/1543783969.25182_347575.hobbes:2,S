    [TCP]: Fix TCP_OFF() bug check introduced by previous change.
    
    The TCP_OFF assignment at the bottom of that if block can indeed set
    TCP_OFF without setting TCP_PAGE.  Since there is not much to be
    gained from avoiding this situation, we might as well just zap the
    offset.  The following patch should fix it.
