Ahhhhh, but once you've reached that point, you might
as well make the kmap array PER PROCESS.
This has some advantages over the per-cpu scheme:
- no address space wastage
- caching is possible
- processes can be rescheduled
- the process can sleep while holding a kmap
It would still avoid the locks and flushes because we
can simply mark the address range used for these per
process kmaps as non-global so they'll be carried with
the process just like the user space page tables are.
This should result in somewhat simpler code than either
a global kmap array or a per-cpu kmap array. The fact
that the amount of kmap space scales with the number of
processes should also completely get rid of processes
sleeping on kmap space.

Rik
