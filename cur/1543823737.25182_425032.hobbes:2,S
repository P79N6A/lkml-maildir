It might be a bit late to get this into 2.6.17.  Although it does look
pretty safe and simple.  
Are many people hitting this problem?
And for 2.6.18 we're hoping to get John's x86 timer rework merged up. 
John, do those patches address this bug?
So if we decide these two patches are not-for-2.6.17 then I'll sit on them
until we decide whether or not to merge John's patches.  If we do, and if
those patches fix this problem then your two patches aren't needed.  If
John's patches don't get merged then I'll need to merge these two.
Hope that all makes sense ;)
