Hmm, it is pretty empty on thinkpad x60, too, and s2ram actually works
here:
root@amd:/home/pavel# acpidump -t FACS
FACS @ 0x7f6f4000
  0000: 46 41 43 53 40 00 00 00 95 15 00 00 00 00 00 00 FACS@...........

...and iasl actually segfaults here, too :-(
root@amd:/data/l/kohji# iasl -d FACS.x60.aml

...hmm, if it is buffer overflow, we have security problem in
iasl. Anyway, how do I decode FACS?
