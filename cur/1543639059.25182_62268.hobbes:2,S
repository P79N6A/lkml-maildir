Subject: Asus A7V333: PCI_GOBIOS and PCI_GODIRECT disagree on one device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is what PCI_GODIRECT says:
  Bus  0, device   7, function  0:
    FireWire (IEEE 1394): PCI device 100c:8026 (Tseng Labs Inc) (rev 0).
      Master Capable.  Latency=16.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x0 [0x7ff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x0 [0xffffffff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x0 [0xffffffff].
This is what PCI_GOBIOS says:
  Bus  0, device   7, function  0:
    FireWire (IEEE 1394): PCI device 104d:8026 (Sony Corporation) (rev 0).
      Master Capable.  Latency=16.
      I/O at 0x0 [0x3].
      I/O at 0x0 [0x3].
      I/O at 0x0 [0xffffffff].
      I/O at 0x0 [0x3].
      I/O at 0x0 [0x3].
      Non-prefetchable 64 bit memory at 0x0 [0xffffffff].
This appears to be the only device where both methods differ.  The
IEEE device is not detected under Windows either.  Is my mainboard
broken?
