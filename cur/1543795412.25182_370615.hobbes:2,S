I don't really disagree, a proper implementation of the concept would also 
be technically quite different. Hacking it into conf.c is the wrong to go 
(or to even start).

Did I say it would go away? No.
It actually makes quite some sense to separate the .config used by kbuild 
from the config used by kconfig.
.config isn't always correctly reread after a manual edit. The syntax 
rules needed by kbuild are more strict than needed for kconfig. The "is 
not set" syntax is not exactly user friendly and all the derived symbols 
aren't needed by kconfig.
My current plan is to somewhere create a copy of .config replacing 
the include/config/MARKER mechanism, which then is also used by kbuild.
In a second step it then would be simple to allow an alternative name 
or even formats for the primary config file.

Oh, really?

$ cp ... linux/config
$ make

Well, that's the problem, I do care about them. I want to keep it working 
without obfuscating it with thousands little features, so we have to 
figure out how to integrate it properly into the big picture.
