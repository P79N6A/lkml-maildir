Well it depends. If ACPI disables interrupts or it keeps some spin lock then
there is a high probability that some interrupts are lost. 
If I do (with no load nor i/o stress):
# time cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state
present:                 yes
capacity state:          ok
charging state:          unknown
present rate:            unknown
remaining capacity:      4000 mAh
present voltage:         14800 mV
real    0m1.118s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.007s
However for me it looks odd that sound is not corrupted (and I believe 
that dma buffer does not hold 1 sec of sound data) while serio and soft modem
is.
