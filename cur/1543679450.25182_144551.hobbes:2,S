<Richard.Curnow@superh.com> (03/07/01 1.1032)
   Ensure that the 'unlink' XDR structures are correctly aligned on 64-bit
   architectures.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1024)
   Replace buggy version of xdr_shift_buf() with the version from 2.5.x.
   This has the added bonus that we also get rid of the need for
   doing kmap() of multiple pages at the same time.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1023)
   Ensure that the lockd clients always use one of the reserved ports.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1022)
   Fix a TCP client corruption problem affecting resent requests.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1021)
   Ensure that if we need to reconnect the socket, we also resend
   the entire message.
   
   Assorted TCP reconnection fixes.
   
   Temporarily raise the necessary CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability
   if we need to bind the socket to a reserved port during a TCP
   reconnection. Check for CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE at mount time.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1020)
   Don't use an RPC child process when reconnecting to a TCP server.
   This is more efficient, and also fixes an existing deadlock
   situation in which the child could be waiting for an xprt_write_lock
   that was being held by the parent.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1019)
   Fix a race: Ensure that requests retry if the remote server
   disconnects us while we're inside xprt_transmit().
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1018)
   Add standard spinlocks to protect the socket from being released by one
   CPU while the other is in a soft interrupt.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1017)
   A patch to ensures that blocks which are not going to time out
   are placed last on the nlm_block list (problem reported by
   Olaf Kirch).
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1016)
   A patch by Patrice Dumas to add a check in order to ensure that we
   really were requesting a blocking lock when we get a reply from the
   server asking us to block.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1015)
   A patch by Patrice Dumas to implement nlmsvc_proc_granted_res.
   When a server receives that callback it deallocates the corresponding
   blocked lock, using the nlmsvc_grant_reply function.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1014)
   Another patch by Chuck Lever that ensures that the PG_uptodate bit gets
   set when the entire page gets written by nfs_writepage_sync()
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1013)
   A patch by Chuck Lever with further cleanups of the RPC socket
   slot allocation code.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/06/27 1.1012)
   A patch by Chuck Lever that cleans up the RPC socket
   slot allocation code.
