Yeah, fair enough, I meant to copy Leonard on this, but was in a hurry to get out
the door on Friday evening.  Leonard was the one that suggested adding the delays
to the macros, and that has fixed the problem for me.  Since I only have a CDRW
on my SCSI card, I haven't really been concerned that adding those delays hurts
performance.  If I had hard drives out there, I might be more concerned with that.
I have been meaning to try the change that I suggested below for a few weeks now,
but I haven't gotten around to it.  I didn't really want to bother Leonard until
I knew if the change would help.
Anyway, here is my reasoning as to why the change might make a difference:
Right now, hp_int gets assigned (RDW_HARPOON((ioport+hp_intstat)) & default_intena)
each time through the while loop.  Looking through the code, it appears to me
that default_intena can have the following bits set:
	RESET, RSEL, PROG_HLT, TIMEOUT, BUS_FREE, XFER_CNT_0, SCAM_SEL, IUNKWN,
        ICMD_COMP, ITICKLE, IDO_STRT, and ITAR_DISC (the last five are grouped
	as AUTO_INT)
That leaves the following bits that will be masked off by the bitwise and:
	PARITY, FIFO, SEL, and PHASE
So hp_int will never have these bits set inside the while loop.  Now, the
very first if inside the while loop is:
      if (hp_int & (FIFO | TIMEOUT | RESET | SCAM_SEL) || bm_status) {
Which depends upon FIFO, which can't be set.  This looks as if it is
an error condition, so it may not be possible for this to cause problems,
but I wanted to try it anyway.
I don't see any of the other bits being used inside the while loop.
Anyway, I will try to give it a try in the next few days to see if
this fixes my problem.  If anyone sees a flaw in my logic, or can
say definitively that this will, or will not help, let me know.
