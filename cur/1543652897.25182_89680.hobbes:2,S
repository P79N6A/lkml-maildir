Something like that.  The good news is that the image is being
loaded the bad news is the BIOS doesn't work, and so the kernels
initial setup code isn't working.
Hopefully this weekend I can do the work in user space to bypass
the BIOS altogether for booting a kernel.  That should make the whole
thing easier to use.

The current interface says load image X at location Y, and entry
at point Z.  Given that every little situation wants a slightly
different tweak I don't think a specific feature in the kernel is
needed.  The user space binaries can incorporate all of the
interesting logic.
