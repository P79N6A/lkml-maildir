The effort is really much better spent trying to get to 2.6 first before
worrying about things like 2.7.  I hope 2.6 doesn't turn into the
"heres my 2.4+preempt+rmap patchset" monster that we saw six months ago.

non-core changes (ie, new drivers) still get added during code freeze,
and during 2.6.x, there's no need for a specific tree just for this.
Adding a new driver doesn't (or at least shouldn't) impact any existing
users if done right.

Nice try. It'll still happen regardless. Bombing Linus with ten zillion
patches when he opens up 2.7.x with "has been tested in 2.6-xyz" isn't
the way to do it. Everything has to happen incrementally, or you end
up with a mess.
