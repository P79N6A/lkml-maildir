show_task() calls thread_saved_pc() which is giving bad results.
Getting the correct PC for blocked threads is easy,

But it does not give you much.  Thread esp and eip are only saved
during switch_to(), at which point eip always points to schedule+0x42c.
If the task is running on a cpu (the interesting case) then neither
t->esp nor t->eip contain useful values so you cannot get the PC for
running tasks.
