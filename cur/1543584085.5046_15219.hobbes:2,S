Based on following the lkml threads on Via chipsets, it seems that
the 686a at or above rev 22, will run UDMA66 just fine.
Below that, lies the flakiness...
My Tyan based 686a rev 22 has been trouble free save a bad cable.
I just acquired a new 1.1G athlon on an asus a7v133. It has a 686b.
What should I expect w the 686b?  and is the Via 686b data sheet 
available somewhere?
