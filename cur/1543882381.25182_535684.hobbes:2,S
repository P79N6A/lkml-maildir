I don't want to remove user visible interfaces either (I understand that
you mean the ioctls by that?). Perhaps we can find a way to make them
still usable with a more in-kernel solution (ie some things become
noops?).

Sure. We should spend some time discussing and planning beforehand so we
don't waste time and effort writing and rewriting.

No problem there.

Regarding open-coded things, I assume you're referring to the extents. I
would argue that they're not open-coded because list.h implements doubly
linked lists, and extents use a singly linked list. That said, I suppose
we could make the extents doubly linked and use list.h, even though that
would be a waste of 4/8 bytes per extent.

Absolutely!

Yes.
Thanks for this email. It's really encouraging, and I'm more than glad
to work with you. Unfortunately, as you've seen me keep saying already,
I have very limited time to work on this. Thankfully you seem to have
more, and Pekka has also stepped up to help, so maybe we can make good
forward progress despite my limitations.
Regards,
Nigel
