The ptrace change in test8 also breaks ltrace - the ltraced child
gets SEGV (on the first PTRACE_SINGLESTEP):
$ strace ltrace ls
...
ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKTEXT, 30364, 0x80490bc, [0x330825cc]) = 0
ptrace(PTRACE_POKETEXT, 30364, 0x80490bc, 0x330825ff) = 0
ptrace(PTRACE_POKEUSER, 30364, 4*EIP, 0x80490bc) = 0
ptrace(PTRACE_SINGLESTEP, 30364, 0, SIG_0) = 0
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
wait4(-1, [WIFSIGNALED(s) && WTERMSIG(s) == SIGSEGV], 0, NULL) = 30364
write(2, " <unfinished ...>\n", 18 <unfinished ...>
)     = 18
write(2, "+++ killed by SIGSEGV +++", 25+++ killed by SIGSEGV +++) = 25
write(2, "\n", 1
)                       = 1
_exit(0)                                = ?
If I back out the change to linux/arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c
ltrace works as expected.
Cheers, Roderich
