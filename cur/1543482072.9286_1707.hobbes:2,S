Hi all.
Here i go again with my dumb question about XFree.
I have the sources of 3.3.2, and the links to download the files for
upgrade to 3.3.3 and 3.3.3.1. Here is the list of files i already have:
3.3.2-patch1.bz2
3.3.2-patch2.bz2
3.3.2-patch3.bz2
X332contrib.tar.bz2
X332src-1.tar.bz2
X332src-2.tar.bz2
X332src-3.tar.bz2
X332test.tar.bz2
utils-1.0.0.tar.bz2
and this is the list of files i (think) need:
( ) 3.3.2-3.3.3.diff.gz
( ) R6.3pl2-3.3.3.diff1.gz
( ) R6.3pl2-3.3.3.diff2.gz
( ) R6.3pl2-3.3.3.diff3.gz
( ) R6.3pl2-3.3.3.diff4.gz
( ) c3.3.2-3.3.3.diff.gz
( ) cfont333.tgz
( ) contrib-3.3.3.diff.gz
( ) 3.3.3-3.3.3.1.diff.gz
( ) doctools-1.0-1.0.1.diff.gz
( ) XFree86-3.3.1-dead-keys.diff.bz2 (this for brazillian accents - Thanks
Arnaldo)
I need all this files to make a new 3.3.3.1? some of them is un-neccessary?
Thanks again.
