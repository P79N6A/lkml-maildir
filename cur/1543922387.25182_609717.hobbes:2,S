Hi Nick,
Thank you for your explanation. I understand. :-)
This is crash_stop (the common infrastructure for debug tools) by Keith Owens.
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-arch@vger.kernel.org/msg01929.html
Is it same as your idea? I think it is very nice solution for debug tools
conflict problem.
By the way, on old notify_chain, if admin wants to change the list order, admin
have to recompile the kernel. My patches add new *generic* notify_chain which
admin can modify the list order. My patches are not only for RAS tools problem.
I'm happy if both patches are merged into mainline. :-)
Thanks,
  Takenori
