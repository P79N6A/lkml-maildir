the emacs comments are gratuitous and completely pointless, they serve
no useful purpose.  fwiw in my .emacs i have:
    (defun cw-linux-c-mode ()
      "C mode with adjusted defaults for use with the Linux kernel."
      (interactive)
      (c-mode)
      (c-set-style "linux"))
    (setq auto-mode-alist
	  (append '(("wk/linux.*/.*\\.[ch]$" . cw-linux-c-mode))
		  '(("/usr/src/linux.*/.*\\.[ch]$" . cw-linux-c-mode))
		  auto-mode-alist))
which actually could be cleaned up a bit (it's been hacked over the
years and never cleaned up suitably) but the idea is pretty simple
