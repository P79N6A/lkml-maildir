Well if it doesn't want to, it could just give select a timeout of 0 though.

Well I would think a NULL, or non-zero timeout would mean its a voluntary
sleep. If the thread has nothing to do until there is an event on the fd,
then it really does want to sleep.
Anyway, this whole thread arose because Con was making the scheduler do
different things for interruptible and uninterruptible sleeps which I
didn't think was a very good idea. Con thought uninterruptible implied
involuntary sleep (though there might have been some confusion).
I don't think they should be treated any differently, but hey I'm not
making any code or having any problems! Just trying to stir the pot a
bit!

I think backboost was very nice. I'd say Con could probably get a lot
further if that was in but its not going to happen now.
