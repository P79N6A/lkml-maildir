Corrupts the stats
Fails to free smb_read_data where in some cases it was freed before
I'm not sure the stats matter but I think you need something more like
residue = copy_to_user(....)
if(smb_read_data) {
   cifs_buf_release(...)
  ...
}
Then
if(residue) {
    total_read += bytes_read - residue;
    FreeXid(xid);
    return total_read ? total_read: -EFAULT;
}
