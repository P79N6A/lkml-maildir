I would think most languages that need 2 or 3 bytes per character would
need a lot less characters, although I think I can think of a few cases
where that isn't true.
Well how about making it '50 characters seems plenty for most people to
be happy'.  If you can handle a couple hundred bytes that should be ok,
and I think most filesystems can.
