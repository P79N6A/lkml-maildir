Yes yes yes of course some of the drivers are confused. And I don't
argue that precomputation is adequate right now. It just wasn't for
the CMD640 those times... I only wanted to reffer to history and
why my timings where different then the computed.

I swallowed his SiS stuff already, since my home main machine is
a SiS735 based board. (Awfoul cheap that thing and quite good price/performance
ratio ;-).

Just another hint: dmaproc is silly nomenclature is should be
dma_strategy <- this would better reflect it's purpose.
