I just had a freeze with 2.4.13 + ext3-0.9.13.  I was unable to
switch vc, but they keyboard still responded.
I pressed alt-scroll lock a few times, and the only 4 address I
got where:
c0133aa68
c0133aa6f
c0133aae8
c0133aaef
This is inside d_lookup.  ksymoops translates the first too
d_lookup+5c/f4.
Can I do anything else to help debug this?
