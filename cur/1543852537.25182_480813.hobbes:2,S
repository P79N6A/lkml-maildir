We are seeing compile failures on ppc64 in ohci-hcd.c as below:
In file included from drivers/usb/host/ohci-hcd.c:949:

Seems that the patch below has introduced USB_OHCI_HCD_PPC_OF enabled by
default.  When it and CONFIG_USB_OHCI_HCD_PPC_SOC are enabled which
occured by default on my config then we end up with two module_init()
calls, which is illegal.

I am guessing that we are only meant to be able to have one of these
defined at a time?  I changed the default to n for this and I could at
least compile the kernel, but I am sure thats not the right fix.
Nicolas?
