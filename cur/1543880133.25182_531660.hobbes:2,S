What I meant in saying the CDDL is less restrictive than the GPL is that
the CDDL can be freely used in conjunction with code under other
licenses, as long as the files licensed under CDDL keep the license
notice, whereas the GPL requires that derived works also have to be
licensed under the GPL, which is not possible in many cases (such as
this one).
