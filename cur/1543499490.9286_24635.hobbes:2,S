The problem is that neither the kernel nor user space have the full
information; and I would argue that more of the information is in user
space than in kernel space.  Look at what PCMCIA does: not only does it
build /dev in user space, but it also manages kernel modules.  I would
hate so see modprobe in the kernel, which would have been one way to
implement kmod.
