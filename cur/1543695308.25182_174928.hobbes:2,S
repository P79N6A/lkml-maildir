Hi Adrian.
Known problem that has been reported back to the maintainers about
one month ago. But they do not seem to care enough to fix it.
The use of "-include" is a bad way to include files. The reader will
not see that global.h is included at all and will wonder how that
information get pulled in.
Furhtermore the location of the header files under security/include
is considered bad practice. All headerfiles used from more than one
directory belongs to include/xxx, in this case include/security.
Then they can be included using
#include <security/secuity.h>
Everything are post 2.6.0 material.
