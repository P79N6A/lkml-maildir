I think this can be added when needed, no?
See no much reason to add notifications which are not used yet.
Please, keep in mind. This patch set can be extended in infinite number
of ways. But!!! It contains only the required minimal functionality.
When we are to add code requiring to know about limit changes or fails
or whatever we can always extend it accordingly.
Thanks,
Kirill
