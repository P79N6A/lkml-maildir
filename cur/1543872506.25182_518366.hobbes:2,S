    ACPI: ec: fix race in status register access
    
    Delay the read of the EC status register until
    after the event that caused it occurs -- otherwise
    it is possible to read and act on stale status that was
    associated with the previous event.
    
    Do this with a perpetually incrementing "event_count" to detect
    when a new event occurs and it is safe to read status.
    
    There is no workaround for polling mode -- it is inherently
    exposed to reading and acting on stale status, since it
    doesn't have an interrupt to tell it the event completed.

    ACPI: make blacklist more verbose
    
    IMHO, ACPI disabled due to DMI failure or blacklisted year should be noted,
    as is done with other ACPI blacklisting.
    
    This will help people troubleshoot when ACPI isn't working.  Status quo is
    a mysterious "ACPI Disabled" message without explanation on BIOS that
    implements ACPI but not DMI.  This is actually fairly common on embedded
    x86 boards.

    libata-acpi: allow _GTF on SATA, but disable on PATA for now
    
    The ACPI specification states, and BIOS implementations depend on,
    _STM being called before _GTF.
    
    SATA does this, but PATA does not.  So for now, simply
    prevent execution of _GTF on PATA devices.  Longer term we
    should implement ACPI support for PATA devices in libata.

    ACPI: repair nvidia early quirk breakage on x86_64
    
    x86_64 nvidia_bugs() broke when we bailed out on not finding the HPET.
    However, the quirk works by checking for not finding the HPET...
    
    Delete the nvidia_hpet_detected flag and simply test for
    not finding the HPET, which is simple to do now that
    acpi_table_parse returns 1 on failure.

    This is a workaround to handle a BIOS bug where the

    a _PRT entry.  Apparently this BIOS error does not

    on various machines.

    ACPI: Altix: reinitialize acpi tables
    
    To provide compatibilty with SN kernels that do and do not
    have ACPI IO support, the SN PROM must build different
    versions of some ACPI tables based on which kernel is booting.
    As such, the tables may have to change at kernel boot time.
    By default, prior to kernel boot, the PROM builds an empty
    DSDT (header only) and no SSDTs. If an ACPI capable kernel
    boots, the kernel will notify the PROM, at platform setup time,
    and the PROM will build full DSDT and SSDT tables.
    
    With the latest changes to acpi_table_init(), the table lengths
    are saved, and when our PROM changes them, the changes are not seen,
    and the kernel will crash on boot. Because of issues with kexec support,
    we are not able to create the tables prior to acpi_table_init().
    As a result, we are making a second call to acpi_table_init() to
    process the rebuilt DSDT and SSDTs.

    ACPI: Altix: cannot register acpi bus driver before bus scan
    
    SN code to initialize the Hub/TIO infrastructure needs to
    execute before bus scanning. This was previously done with
    an early call to acpi_bus_register_driver().  But now that
    ACPI is using the Linux driver model, a driver cannot be registered
    that early. Make changes to have the init routines invoked via
    calls to acpi_get_devices().
