I'm neutral on this change so long as it can be done without 
introducing problems for device-mapper.

I can't speak for the 'mount' code base, but I don't think it'll
make any significant difference to LVM2 - we'd still have to do 
all the same device scanning as we do now because we have to be
aware of md devices defined in on-disk metadata regardless of 
whether or not the kernel knows about them at the time the 
command is run.

And attempts to open a device exclusively.  That's one check LVM2 
does before running 'pvcreate' on a device.

For device-mapper devices, 'dmsetup deps' and ls --tree already
gives you this information reasonably efficiently.
Would others find the proposal useful for non-dm devices?
And rather than adding code just to dm and md, would it be better 
to implement it by enhancing bd_claim()?
