True enough.  And in that case the design that I was describing wouldn't
make sigaction() that much more expensive since if you are not in the POSIX
thread environment (more precisely, the thread was not created with
CLONE_SIGHAND) each thread has its own sighand structure and the "global" 
locking mechanisum I had proposed would only require the taking of one 
additional lock.
However, special casing ITIMER_PROF is also a reasonable avenue of approach.
The performance monitor code can also deliver signals to user space when
a sampling buffer overflows, and this can have the same kind of scaling
problem as ITIMER_PROF.  I'll have to do a little research to figure out
how exactly that works, but that signal (SIGIO?) would also be a candidate
for special casing on our platform.
