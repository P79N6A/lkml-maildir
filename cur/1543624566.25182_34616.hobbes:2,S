Yes, I think it is at least needed to share the ring buffer.

There are different uses for netlink, but one of the most common is event
signalling (high performance) for routing and interface changes. Also
denied/accounted/accepted packets need to be logged by something like ulogd
because printk is not the right solution for that.

Posix and BSD Auditing events are an example for that. In secure mode the
system must be halted on overflow. a printk replacement will want to keep the
oldest entries and a enterprise event system may want to keep the oldest.

yes, but even larger dynamic kernel buffers will not stop you from running
into full buffers. And I think a flexible policy will allow everybody to be
happy with your framework. the only way to get it accepted, right?

I agree, it adds more complexity. Simple solutions are prefered, as long as
they are solutions :)
