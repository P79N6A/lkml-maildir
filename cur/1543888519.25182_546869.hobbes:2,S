You asked for it :)
Please patch 2.6.22-rc2 with
http://tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.22-rc2/patch-2.6.22-rc2-hrt2.patch
and
http://www.tglx.de/private/tglx/ht-debug/tracer.diff
Compile it with the config
http://www.tglx.de/private/tglx/ht-debug/config.debug
You should find something like:
(         swapper-0    |#0): new 67173 us user-latency.
along with the familiar "NOHZ ......" message in your log file.
Once that happened please do:
$ cat /proc/latency_trace >trace.txt
compress it and send it to me along with the full dmesg output or put
both up to some place, where I can download it.
Michal,
IIRC you encountered the same P4/HT related wreckage. Can you do the
same ?
Thanks,
	tglx
