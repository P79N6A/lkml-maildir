in the past couple of years i saw double-faults at a rate of perhaps 
once a year - and i frequently hack lowlevel glue code! So the 
usefulness of this code in the field, and especially on an embedded 
platforms, is extremely limited.
in fact, i've experienced triple-faults (== spontaneous reboots) to be 
at least 10 times more frequent than double-faults! I.e. _if_ your 
kernel (or hardware) is screwed up to the degree that it would 
double-fault, it will much more likely also triple-fault.
IIRC we added the double-fault handler to debug the PAE code originally.  
Now years down the road, making it configurable-out if EMBEDDED makes 
lots of sense.
