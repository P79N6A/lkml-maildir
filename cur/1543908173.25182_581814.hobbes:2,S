Oh please, don't tell me you don't want an optimising compiler.
And if you _do_ want one, well you're in this mess because you
chose C as implementation language and C has some pretty strange
rules.  Trying to use not-all-that-well-defined-and-completely-
misunderstood features of the language doesn't make things easier;
trying to use something that isn't even part of the language and
that your particular compiler originally supported by accident,
and that isn't yet an officially supported feature, and that on
top of it all has a track record of problems -- well it makes me
wonder if you're in this game for fun or what.

No, it does *not* give it to you automatically; you have to do
either the asm() thing, or the not-defined-at-all *(volatile *)&
thing.

So that's rm include/linux/compiler-gcc*.h then.  Good luck with
the intel compiler, maybe it works more to your liking.
