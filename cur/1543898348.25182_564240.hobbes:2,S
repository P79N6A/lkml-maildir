Subject: why does git perpetually complain about include/asm-blackfin/macros.h?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/2/53

  for the umpteenth time, after doing a pull, i see this:
$ git diff
diff --git a/include/asm-blackfin/macros.h b/include/asm-blackfin/macros.h
deleted file mode 100644
index e69de29..0000000
$
  this happens constantly.  what's going on with this file?
