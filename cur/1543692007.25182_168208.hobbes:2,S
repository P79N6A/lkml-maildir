Subject: 2.6 eicon/ and hardware/eicon/ drivers using the same symbols
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I got the link error below in 2.6.0-test5-mm4 (but it doesn't seem to be 
specific to -mm).
It seems some drivers under eicon/ and hardware/eicon/ use the same 
symbols. Either some symbols should be renamed or Kconfig dependencies 
should ensure that you can't build two such drivers statically into the 
kernel at the same time.
