I heard that project tree maintainers are encouraged to post merge plans
in time, so I'm going to do so now too.  Although this time there isn't
much in store for drivers/{ieee1394,firewire} for the merge window
because we all got sidetracked lately...  It's basically bugfixes which
I felt were too late for 2.6.23.
To be merged:
