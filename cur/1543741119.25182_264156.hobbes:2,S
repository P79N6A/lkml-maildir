This appears a result of changes in:
    arch/i386/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S
which causes the kernel start address to
change from 0xc0100000 to 0x100000 causing
objcopy to gag.  I rolled back to a 2.6.8.1
version of the above linker map file and did
get the kernel to build and [mostly] boot.
However it incorporated Ingo's RT patches and
wasn't exactly a vanilla 2.6.9-mm1.
While I don't recommend the above as a fix,
a repeat of the experiment will require adding
the following to the linker text section:
--- /user1/linux/linux-2.6.8.1/arch/i386/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S
