Yup, we are making IBM eat up its 'crystal plate' new drives. I have seen
two of them dying on a month. And we will return also the third without
even waiting it to fail.
(btw, I am still using -in low end linux boxen- Quantum SCSI drives that
came with prehistoric macs, SEs and so on, so they can be about 8 years
old. They work, slow for today standars, but work. Can anybody say the
same about ide drives ?)
