I think it's a case of "better the devil you know..".
Think of all the security scares sendmail has historically had. But it's a
pretty secure piece of work now - and people know if backwards and
forward. Few people advocate switching from sendmail these days (sure,
they do exist, but what I'm saying is that a long track record that
includes security issues isn't necessarily bad, if it has gotten fixed).
Of course, you may be right on wuftpd. It obviously wasn't designed with
security in mind, other alternatives may be better.
