Right.  But in doing this we also don't want to bloat the very small
programs/functionality we currently hack directly in

Yes, but how many of these require a 'klibc' ?  One of the other tiny
libcs is probably a better bet for any sort of 'large' project.  IMHO,
the klibc stuff should be just big enough to support the 'normal' cases,
ie stuff we do now and related.

Well, occording to the spec file hpa posted, it's just a cpio(1)
archive, so anything is possible.
