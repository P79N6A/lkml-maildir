Which one do you mean? The real signed-unsigned bugs in the kernel or
the problem of gcc to weed out the false positives.
"find /usr/src/linux -type f | xargs cat" will catch every single bug
in the linux kernel, but I bet it won't get too many fixed. Those gcc
warnings are a bit better, but just a bit.

If you manually seperate false positives from real bugs, then those
real ones should get fixed. Feel free to bombard me with any, but try
to keep the ratio of false positives low.
