No, I checked the list of applets, and no battery monitoring applet.
I configured the panel  to "Load only trusted applets internal", and depleted
the list of trusted applets, tested again with test11-ac1 and it froze in the
same place as always.
With respect to a battery monitor, in the KDE control center, the Battery 
Monitor section of Power Control notes that "Your computer doesn't have the 
Linux APM (Advanced Power Management) software drivers installed, or doesn't 
have the APM kernel drivers installed -"
