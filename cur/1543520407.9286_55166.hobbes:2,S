Subject: 2.3.34 compile error (SMP & joystick)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Ignore the "nonstandard" config options--they relate to work I'm doing.  The
bug has be replicated in vanilla 2.3.34.  I have traced 'current'.  It is
outside what I'm doing.  The problem goes away if SMP unset.
