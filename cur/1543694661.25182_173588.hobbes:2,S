This is solved very easily and has been done by Seagate before for long
warranty devices: Don't hold the devices and promise the customer to
receive same or newer/better device on warranty after the product is no
longer produced. That will make your revenues and your customer more
happy, as long as product quality isn't decreasing over drive generations.
So reducing the default warranty is no good customer service in my
opinion. And in Germany you have 2 years warranty per law, which
resemble the life cycle of a PC quite nicely.
