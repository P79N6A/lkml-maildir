The dcache has long chains of pointers and tends to show up on things like
memory areas. It has a lot of potential for them it seems. if you are running
< 2.2.17 definitely give a newer kernel a go before assuming hardware related
things. There are _lots_ of bug fixes for stuff that could give the same 
result from software errors
