Huh?  No, you ask for 2000 bytes into a buffer that can only take 1000
bytes without hitting an unmapped page, returning EFAULT or giving a
SIGSEGV is perfectly acceptable.
As a coder, I'd *really* prefer that to hiding the bug!
There's only one case which really actually cares for a valid reason:
the hack in copying mount options.
