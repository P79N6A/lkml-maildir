Doing a time based one would only require knowing the (avg) delay of
seeks, whereas doing a bytes based one would also require knowing the
(avg) speed of the device.
That is, if you're also interested in providing a latency guarantee.
Because that'd force you to convert bytes to time again.
I'm not sure thats a good way to go with as long as a majority of
devices still have a non-0 seek penalty (SSDs just aren't there yet for
most of us).
