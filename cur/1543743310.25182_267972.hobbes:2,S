However, the problem is that I probably want to compile a working
kernel *now*, not when the GCC people finally get around to fixing
the b0rkedness they added for my architecture in gcc 3.2.3.  So I
get to keep 3.2.2 around until it's fixed.  (Feel free to replace
3.2.3 with whatever arch-dependent value you like).
