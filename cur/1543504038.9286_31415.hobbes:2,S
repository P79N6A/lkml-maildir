"Priority inheritance."  It adds complexity to _every_ place where the
kernel blocks.  Remember, we don't always use locks.  The page cache
has a single PG_Locked flag on the page, plus a per-page wait queue.
The buffer cache does similar things.  Unless you put the extra bonus
code into the general-purpose wait queue macros, doing this sort of
thing is going to stomp on all sorts of bits of the kernel.
There's a much, much easier way --- just revoke the SCHED_IDLE
scheduling class when a process explicitly calls schedule().  That
automatically takes care of every single case where a process gives up
the CPU from inside the kernel.  The only special case then becomes the
schedule inside return_to_user, where we want to keep SCHED_IDLE
intact.  
However, that adds code to two of the hottest paths in the whole
kernel.  Not nice.
