[Summary: task 1 does a repeated loop of (locked test_and_set_bit;
 locked clear_bit) on a shared writable mapped file.  task 2 updates a
 totally different area of the same page of the same file and exits.
 task 1's operation gets trashed.]
Ack.  I looked at this for a while, but it's one of those things that
you just know *can't* be happening... until you realise what's going
wrong.
OK, what happens is that munmap() of a MAP_SHARED mapped file is
trashing the data of another process on a different CPU which happens
still to have the same page mapped.
munmap() (happening implicitly due to exit() in your test program) does
a filemap_sync(), which ends up calling ext2_file_write to write the
page cache contents via ext2.  However, ext2 has to do an
update_vm_cache() in its write routines, and that ends up copying the
same buffer cache contents we just copied, *back* into the page cache.
Any other process which was modifying the page in memory at the time
loses its updates.
Exactly the same happens on NFS, by the way.
The patch below fixes this, but the ext2 side is a little messy
(unavoidably).  update_vm_cache assumes that the source data is coming
from kernel memory.  ext2 therefore really has to pass the bh->b_data
in, not the user VA, when calling update_vm_cache.  However, from that
address it is impossible for update_vm_cache to tell whether the
original data came from the page cache in the first place or not.  And
ext2 can't tell without doing an extra unnecessary page cache lookup.
update_vm_cache_conditional accepts the original, source address of the
data as an extra parameter to allow it to check for this overwrite
special case.  ext2 can pass that in easily.  For NFS, it is more
straightforward: NFS does the page cache update itself, so testing
source==dest is just a two-liner in the write code.
On 2.3 this just isn't an issue due to the VM infrastructure fixes.
