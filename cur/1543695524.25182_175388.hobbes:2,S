Hi,
Kernel 2.6.0-test9 was compiled as following
make allmodconfig
make bzImage
make modules
Attempt at booting with this kernel resulted in following message
and machine freeze.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with     
    idebus=xx
pnp: the driver 'ide' has been registered
Using anticipatory io scheduler
hda: 8032MB, CHS=1024/255/63
devfs_mk_dir: invalid argument. <6> hda:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Kernel was booted with
foll-------------------------------------------------------------------
owing commandline in grub
    kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.0-test9 ro root=/dev/hda1 debug
The actual hard disk parameters as reported by kernel 2.4.20 are

hda: WDC WD200EB-11BHF0, ATA DISK drive
blk: queue c03c9f40, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff)

After manual tracing the kernel source, found following call tree 
idedisk_attach (drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1840)
  add_disk (drivers/genhd/genhd.c:193)
  register_disk (fs/partitions/check.c:335)
    devfs_add_partitioned (fs/partitions/devfs.c:80)
      devfs_mk_dir()
printk revealed that devfs_mk_dir() is getting called with a
0-byte string. What is going wrong? 
Amitay.
