Hello,
I object.  Using array is intentional.  Slave aware controllers (PATA / 
ata_piix) will use [0..1], most SATA controllers will use only [0], and 
PM aware ones will use [0..15].  The intention was requiring low level 
drivers of only what they know and normalize them in the core layer.
eg. Current std SATA reset routines consider the argument as *class (a 
single class value) and it's intentional.  As long as a lldd is aware of 
only one device per port, it's allowed/recommeded to consider the passed 
classes argument as a pointer to single class value.  The rest is upto 
the core libata layer.
