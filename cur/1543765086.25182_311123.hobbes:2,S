OK, I was not clear here.  When I say it cannot be trusted I'm in my
sysadmin cap, not my user cap.
Hiding the mountpoint from root has dual purpose:
  1) Sysadmin won't accidentaly spy on user's private files
  2) User can't confuse sysadmin deliberately, by creating a
     filesystem containing files he otherwise wouldn't be able to
     create
For 1) your porposal makes sense, however for 2) it's useless, since
now the user doesn't want the hiding.
