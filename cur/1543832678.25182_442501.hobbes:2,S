Well smp_call_function uses it so I don't know if rarely called applies.
However when called with the NMI vector every instance of send_IPI_allbutself
transforms this into send_IPI_mask.  Which is why we need to know our current
cpu in the first place.
Therefore why don't we just do that explicitly in crash.c
i.e.
static void smp_send_nmi_allbutself(void)
{
	cpumask_t mask = cpu_online_map;
	cpu_clear(safe_smp_processor_id(), mask);
	send_IPI_mask(mask, NMI_VECTOR);
}
That will guarantee that any effects this code paranoia may have
are only seen in the crash dump path.

No.  Except that other architectures have cheaper per pointers so they
don't have that problem.
