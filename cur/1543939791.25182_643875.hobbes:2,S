Subject: [PATCH] x86: fix section mismatch warning in setup_64.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/26/218

Fix the following warning:
WARNING: arch/x86/kernel/built-in.o(.cpuinit.text+0x7a3): Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:amd_detect_cmp in 'init_amd'
The function amd_detect_cmp were annotated __init and
was only used from init_amd() which are annotated __cpuinit.
Annotate amd_detect_cmp() with _cpuinit to fix it.
