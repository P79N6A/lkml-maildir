"kernel stack is too small" - it fits at the end of 2-page per-process area 
which also holds the task_struct.  This is also why the max symlink depth is 
3 instead of something more common (and useful; 3 causes some grief for us 
when so many things are symlinks into AFS and we use symlinks in AFS to 
"version" software release areas).
