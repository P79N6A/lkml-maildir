(Sorry, I didn't notice your patch when you posted it in the past, or
I would have responded back then.)
FWIW, this was tried between 2.6.11-rc1 and 2.6.11-rc2 (except it was
256->2048 instead of 256->1024), and it was reverted before 2.6.11-rc2
because it broke booting with lilo -- for many people, the change
caused their system to freeze early during boot.
This is what the 2.6.11-rc2 changelog has to say about the matter:

Has this issue been addressed yet? (i.e. does 1024 avoid the problem
that 2048 had, or did anything else change in the kernel between
2.6.11-rc1 and today to prevent the problem from happening again?)
