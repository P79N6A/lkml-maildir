No. That's not possible with oprofile.
To get something like that I hack the code and use relayfs to transfer 
the data to user-space.
Note, the examples for relayfs show using sprintf to generate text 
output. *Don't* do that. Use binary buffers and translate them to text 
off-line in user-mode. sprintf is awfully inefficient for large amounts 
of data.
