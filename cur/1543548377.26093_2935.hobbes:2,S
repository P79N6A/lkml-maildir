I don't think I age anonymous pages any more than any other type of
page.  Perhaps you are saying that shared pages should recieve some
bonus?  That is a different issue and it is handled naturally with my
patch.  If shared pages are actually used then PageTouch() will be
called on them more often.  This should work better than the current
PG_referenced bit.
Prehaps I am missing your point.  Can you explain in more detail how
these pages are aged more often?
