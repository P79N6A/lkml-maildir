Hello,
I was just wondering if it is possible to flash the BIOS of a PCI IDE
card from within Linux. I have an OEM IT8212 card with a really old
BIOS which the vendor does not support with a BIOS flashing tool. ITE
Tech's flashing tool appears to work, but it fails to verify that the
flash was successful and indeed the ROM is unchanged.
How is the BIOS on such cards different from the firmware on other
cards? Is it possible to use the kernel firmware loader to load a
different image at runtime?
Thanks for the help,
Rahul
