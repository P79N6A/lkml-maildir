I've been looking at binfmt_elf.c myself as well, and I've noticed that
there are a few things it doesn't check, like:
e_version
(only one ELF version exists, but why not check anyway,
might catch a corrupted executable or when new ELF versions /do/ appear
the code to reject formats not supported is in place - seems right to me
to check it - basic sanity check)
e_ehsize
(Linux seems to ignore this. It's there to validate that the ELF header
has the correct size - why not check?  Again, this might catch corrupted
executables. Seems like the prudent thing to do, to me)
I seem to remember a few other things that could be checked that currently
are not, but I can't remember those off the top of my head (I need to go
re-read 
ftp://tsx.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC/ELF.doc.tar.gz
)
I've been thinking of trying to fix binfmt_elf.c up a bit to do as much
validation as possible (seems to me that the more checking we do the safer
we'll be - I don't se any reason /not/ to check), but I have not yet
gotten my head wrapped around enough of the code to actually write a patch
yet.
I don't really know what the purpose of this reply is other than to say
that you're not the only one approaching this, and that if you need
someone to test patches, then I don't mind doing that.. :)
