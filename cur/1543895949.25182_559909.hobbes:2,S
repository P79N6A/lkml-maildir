Still, anything that depends on increasing the length of file or path
names to refer to different versions will encounter problems for long
file names and deep paths because there is an upper limit on file and
path name lengths.
It may be possible to use namespaces where an application can change the
view it (and it's children) will have on the storage by switching to a
different namespace and tagging it with for instance a specific version
or date we're interested in. Not sure if we actually pass namespace
information down to the file systems yet though, last time I checked
they were only visible for the VFS.
