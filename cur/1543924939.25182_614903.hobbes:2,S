Which is why we need to greatly reduce the number of pages
scanned to free a page.  In all workloads.

An algorithm that only clears the referenced bit and then
moves the anonymous page from the active to the inactive
list will do a lot less work than an algorithm that needs
to scan the *whole* active list because all of the pages
on it are referenced.
This is not a theoretical situation: every anonymous page
starts out referenced!
Add in a relatively small inactive list on huge memory
systems, and we could have something of an acceptable
algorithmic complexity.
