OK, I understood. However, judging by tiny amount of indentation¹ this
define should be used when messing with "Flag" field
	unsigned long Flag;     /* |31-Type-16|15-Mask-0| */
of struct (typedef, actually) called "isdnProps". Other defines nearby
are unused also. More, "isdnProps" which is typedef holding this field in
turn, is also unused.
¹ Even less than GNU.
