   My own hot button is making sure that the definition of what

   level, but to provide a single point of definition in the kernel (say,
   /dev/useractivity or the equivalent) that the user-level daemon could
   listen to.
Unfortunately the term "user activity" seems a bit too vague for this. IMHO
different users (but also applications) present different needs that you cannot
fit with a single device node.
Example. The user expects that the keyboard light is turned off after 10
minutes of keyboard inactivity, disregarding the mouse movements. This makes
sense since the glare at the bottom disturb the Quake sessions. :-) However when
the screen is blanked, the user expects that either keyboard or mouse events
can unblank it...
