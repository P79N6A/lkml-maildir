... And it's also what many admins would do when ORBS probes their machines for the 
50,000th time...
The problem with orbs is NOT that it probes for open relays, but that
the ORBS maintainer has a policy of blacklisting anyone who disagrees with him -
regardless of whether or not the blocked systems relay or not.
The probe system also does not handle systems which intelligently relay normal
mail and not SPAM.
Vixie's MAPS is nice because it only lists spammers. ORBS lists mail servers
sometimes based upon false assumptions or "whims".
