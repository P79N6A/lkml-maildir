That is not satisfactory since this relation is not expressed in sysfs at all 
(device-mapper issue, discuss it on dm-devel if you want). EVMS is using 
normal dm devices (like LVM2 does), so, although there are subdirectories 
of /sys/block/hdc, they correspond only to normal ("obsolete", kernel-space, 
unusable together with EVMS) partitions.
patrakov@lfs:~$ find /sys/block/hdc/ -type d
/sys/block/hdc/
/sys/block/hdc/queue
/sys/block/hdc/queue/iosched
/sys/block/hdc/hdc1
/sys/block/hdc/hdc2
and so on
(The last two entries correspond to unusable devices)
Real block devices with filesystems on them devices are there:
patrakov@lfs:~$ find /sys/block/dm* -type d
/sys/block/dm-0
/sys/block/dm-1
/sys/block/dm-2
/sys/block/dm-3
/sys/block/dm-4
/sys/block/dm-5
/sys/block/dm-6
/sys/block/dm-7
/sys/block/dm-8
EVMS installation is non-intrusive if you want to use it just for loop devices 
(just enable device mapper in vanilla linux-2.6.9 and install userspace 
tools), so you can try it without any risk.
