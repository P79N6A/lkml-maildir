There can be two reasons:
(1) You are using matrox's mga module. They have
    'program chip core to production level frequency
    instead of bios safe one' in their changelog.
    Although difference 100% makes (2) more probably.
(2) matroxfb does not try to activate any AGP transfer
    mode. Maybe some X driver tries and succeeds.
You can try:
time dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/fb0 bs=1M count=8
before X and after X. If times are same, then it is
chip core frequency. If times are 2:1, it is either
chip memory freqency, or AGP...
