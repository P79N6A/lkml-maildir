There is a nice mixture of documentation about swusp, video stuff,
developer documentation, and one short paragraph about PM_TRACE that
tells me nothing new. Could you point me to the documentation part that
you are referring to, and that tells me what to do if PM_TRACE shows
the usb device but the failure only occurs when I load the sk98lin
driver?
Thanks and regards,
Tino
