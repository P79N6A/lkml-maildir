That would be me ...
What is the problem that your patch is fixing? Other than the 
while loop cosmetic changes, the only thing I see is to do 
with rescheduling (ie, do not invoke do_try_to_free_pages or
run_task_queue() if need_resched is set). Note that before this 
patch went in, as in 2.3.43 for example, the loop used to be:
                do {
                        /* kswapd is critical to provide GFP_ATOMIC
                           allocations (not GFP_HIGHMEM ones). */
                        if (nr_free_pages() - nr_free_highpages() >= freepages.high)
                                break;
                        if (!do_try_to_free_pages(GFP_KSWAPD, 0))
                                break;
                        run_task_queue(&tq_disk);
                } while (!tsk->need_resched);
                tsk->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
                interruptible_sleep_on(&kswapd_wait);
        }
Which is the behavior I _tried_ to preserve. Oh, btw, I am not convinced
that you should do a run_task_queue after _all_ pgdats have been scanned,
rather than after each one.
