Now guys, I did not follow the whole lengthy and feisty thread, but IIRC 
Con's scheduler has been attacked because, among other argouments, was 
requiring X to be reniced. This happened like a month ago IINM.
I did not have time to look at Con's scheduler, and I only had a brief 
look at Ingo's one (looks very promising IMO, but so was the initial O(1) 
post before all the corner-cases fixes went in).
But this is not a about technical merit, this is about applying the same 
rules of judgement to others as well to ourselves.
We went from a "renicing X to -10 is bad because the scheduler should 
be able to correctly handle the problem w/out additional external plugs" 
to a totally opposite "let's renice -10 X, the whole SCHED_NORMAL kthreads 
class, on top of all the tasks owned by root" [1].
From a spectator POV like myself in this case, this looks rather "unfair".
[1] I think, before and now, that that's more a duck tape patch than a 
    real solution. OTOH if the "solution" is gonna be another maze of 
    macros and heuristics filled with pretty bad corner cases, I may 
    prefer the former.
