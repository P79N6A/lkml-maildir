Not broadly useful is certainly my impression.
It feels to me like these patches are simply doing too much.

I certainly have not.  I do feel that developing this just from the
top down is the wrong way to do this.  In some of the preliminary
patches we have found several pieces of code that we will have to
touch that is currently in need of a cleanup.  That is why I have
been cleaning up /proc.  sysctl is in need of similar treatment
but is in less bad shape.
Part of it is that I have stopped to look more closely at what
other people are doing and to look at alternative implementations.
One interesting thing I have manged to do is by using ptrace I
have implemented enter for the existing filesystem namespaces 
without having to modify the kernel.  This at least says
that enter and debugging are two faces of the same coin.

I don't think that is the case on the fundamentals.  I think with pids
I am an inch away from implementing a pid namespace that is both
recursive, efficient, and can map all of the pids into another pid
space if that is desirable.  Plus I can merge most of it incrementally
in the existing kernel, before I even allow for multiple pid spaces.
Which should reduce the patch for multiple pid namespaces to something
reasonable to talk about.

I guess my problem there is that isn't something on which to build
that is something to hang things off of.
