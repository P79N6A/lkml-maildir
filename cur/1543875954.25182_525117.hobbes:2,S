Hi,
	I agree, and as you said I did exactly that:
out_nohpet:
	iounmap(hpet_virt_address);
	hpet_virt_address = NULL;
	boot_hpet_disable = 1; <<<--- this ensures that is_hpet_capable() will never return positive value
	I also sent an updated version on my patch with subject line "[PATCH v2] Add suspend/resume for HPET"
	I forgot (a typo) to check error code in  hpet_register_sysfs
	Thanks to Sergei Shtylyov for pointing me on that.
	This patch should be ok.
	Best regards,
		Maxim Levitsky
