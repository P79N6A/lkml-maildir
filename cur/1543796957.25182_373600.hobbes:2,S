That already works today. All distros I know are capable to run
kernel.org kernels, if you care yourself, that the rootfs is accessible.

Just give it its time. It will happen without anybody claiming to have
or to be a standard. We are already much more similar than we've ever
been across the current devel releases of all major distros.
The complete replacement of hotplug by udev rules, kernel uevents and
kernel event replay triggers made the situation so much simpler and better
than it ever was.
It's, as in most cases, not about someone defining some standard, talk a
lot about it, create an interest group, write a noisy paper... - it's the
whole lot of real work to come up with a solution that is convincing enough
for the involved parties, and to manage all the different interests people
have and still get things done at the same time. It has almost nothing
to do with a "standard".
Convergence will just happen, cause it makes sense and there is a reasonable
way to do it. And there was no such thing in that area in the past that
made this kind of sense.
And yeah, the never ending discussion about stupid options like devfs
does not help anything here. It should have been removed a long time
ago, so that the the confused people start to walk in the right direction
instead of delaying the needed convergence progress again and again.
Thanks,
Kay
