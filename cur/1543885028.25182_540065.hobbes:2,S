Subject: [patch 5/9] cio: Deprecate read_dev_chars() and read_conf_data{,_lpm}().
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/4/324

From: Cornelia Huck <cornelia.huck@de.ibm.com>
These helper functions are a leftover from 2.4 sync I/O and are a
notorious source for bugs. They lead to device driver specific code
creeping into cio, and some issues can't really be fixed at all.
Device drivers can easily implement those functions themselves in a
more robust manner, so let's get rid of them.

 Who:	David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
 
 ---------------------------
+
+What:	read_dev_chars(), read_conf_data{,_lpm}() (s390 common I/O layer)
+When:	December 2007
+Why:	These functions are a leftover from 2.4 times. They have several
+	problems:
+	- Duplication of checks that are done in the device driver's
+	  interrupt handler
+	- common I/O layer can't do device specific error recovery
+	- device driver can't be notified for conditions happening during
+	  execution of the function
+	Device drivers should issue the read device characteristics and read
+	configuration data ccws and do the appropriate error handling
+	themselves.
