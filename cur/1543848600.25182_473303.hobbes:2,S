The comment above tty_flip_buffer_push() says "This function must not be
called from IRQ context if tty->low_latency is set". In this case
tty_flip_buffer_push() is called from IRQ context. Do you think
tty->low_latency can still be set for this case ? or I misunderstood
your statement completely...

Let me know, I'll fix them too.

If we cannot delete the file then we must fix it. It's not good the
drivers using old and deprecated interfaces in current phase of kernel
development.
