apache documentation states:
#  NOTE that some kernels refuse to setgid(Group) or semctl(IPC_SET)
#  when the value of (unsigned)Group is above 60000;
#  don't use Group nobody on these systems!
does this apply to linux in either the 2.2 or 2.4 kernels?
i'd like to use a block of uids from maybe 63000-65000, with
gids of the same number, for web domains, and want to know if i'll have
any problems.
Thanx,
-Tony
