I don't have a copy of the C standard handy, but that sounds to me
like the result of (unsigned long)(&x) - KERNELBASE is undefined.
Also, what does the standard say about casting pointers to integral
types?  IIRC you aren't entitled to assume that a pointer will fit in
any integral type, or anything about the bit patterns that you get.
My point is that the kernel makes some assumptions about how pointers
are represented, which are eminently reasonable assumptions, but which
"portable" C programs are not entitled to make according to the C
standard.
