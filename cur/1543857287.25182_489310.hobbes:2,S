Subject: 2.6.19 build hangs while running git for no reason...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/7/196

Right at the start of the build:
scripts/kconfig/conf -s arch/arm/Kconfig
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  SYMLINK include/asm-arm/arch -> include/asm-arm/arch-integrator
  Generating include/asm-arm/mach-types.h
  CHK     include/linux/utsrelease.h
  UPD     include/linux/utsrelease.h
Where there's a one line gap the build hangs for five minutes (eating no CPU, 
blocked one something).  I hit "enter" and it resumes again.  It does this 
reproducibly for me.
It seems to be blocked running:
   6983 pts/3    S+     0:00 /bin/sh /usr/bin/git rev-parse --verify HEAD
Which is odd because this is the release version and hasn't got .git stuff in 
it.  I did an "rm /usr/bin/git" (I don't use it, I dunno why ubuntu decided 
to install it) and the hang went away.  Why is the build even _calling_ git 
on a release version?
The invocation was:
  make ARCH="${KARCH}" CROSS_COMPILE="${CROSS_TARGET}"- &&
Where KARCH=arm and CROSS_TARGET is a cross compile toolchain that built a 
working copy of uClibc.
