If it was O_DIRECT and aio, then we would be close.

Because I'm really lazy - the core of this was basically first written
as a quick hack and then I always go shopping for reusable data
structures. prio trees fit the bill nicely, they described extents and
allowed loopup with a key anywhere in that extent. You are right in that
I don't need the overlap handling at all, and Chris already tried to
talk me into reusing his btrfs extent code :-)
So I may just do the latter, turning it into a lib/extent-map.c in the
longer run. My first priority was just having something that worked so I
could test it. At the end of the day, not a single soul would ever
notice if the prio tree ended up being slightly slower than a custom
solution.
