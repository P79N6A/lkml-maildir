Which sub-vma ranges? The ones created with mprotect?
I'm curious about what is the difference between this sub-tree and the main 
tree... you have some point, but I miss which one :-) Actually when doing a 
lookup in the main tree the extra nodes in the subtree are not searched, so 
you get an advantage.
One possible point is that a VMA maps to one mmap() call (with splits from 
mremap(),mprotect(),partial munmap()s), and then they use sub-VMAs instead of 
VMA splits.

Ok, there are two different situations, I'm globally unconvinced until I 
understand the usefulness of a different sub-tree.
a) UML. The answer is _no_ to all guesses, since we must implement page tables 
of a guest virtual machine via mmap() or remap_file_pages. And they're as 
fragmented as they get (we get one-page-wide VMAs currently).
b) the proposed glibc usage. The original Ulrich's request (which I cut down 
because of problems with objrmap) was to have one mapping per DSO, including 
code,data and guard page. So you have three protections in one VMA.
However, this is doable via this remap_file_pages, adding something for 
handling private VMAs (handling movement of the anonymous memory you get on 
writes); but it's slow on swapout, since it stops using objrmap. So I've not 
thought to do it.
