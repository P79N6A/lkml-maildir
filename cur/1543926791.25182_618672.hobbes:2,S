I'm sorry. I wanted to know whether the below approach is possible.

I don't care if some kernel module calls vfs_* without setting last_vfsmount
because there is no reason to reject requests from kernel code.
Setting last_vfsmount is required for requests from userland process.
This approach makes it possible to
(1) tell whether the vfs_* calls are from userland or kernel
and
(2) leave kernel modules that are not called from userland unchanged.
This is why this patch doesn't and needn't to modify fs/*/ files.
Thanks.
