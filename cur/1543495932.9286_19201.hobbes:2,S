    a)  Adding new features that aren't in the baseline kernel:
	The Mastodon kernel (2.0.28) is patched to include my
	new.new.mem memory patch (essential), the boot logo patch
	(ditto), the WebShield let-every-ethernet-driver-
	autoprobe-because-its-Unix-damnit patch (ditto), a hack to the
	ide driver so that it won't arbitrarily trim the disk size of
	large disks (ditto), a whole bunch of 2.0.36 ethernet drivers
	(ditto), a bunch of other patches that get rid of (IMO)
	useless driver initialization messages (not essential, but
	nice), and probably a few more that I can't think of offhand.
    b)  Unpatched Linux kernel Makefiles (2.0.x) won't compile on
	Mastodon, because they have GNUisms in them.   (things like
	``find <something> -maxdepth'' makes Berkeley find laugh
	hysterically, (k)sh doesn't do ``if hash encaps'' the same
	way bash does; I've still not figured out why menuconfig
	doesn't work at all, but at least I can point users at
	xconfig, because tk just works.)
                  ____
    david parsons \bi/ make menuconfig gives a single-line menu, which is
                   \/                                  not exactly useful.
