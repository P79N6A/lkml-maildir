I am sorry, yes, please don't apply to 2.5. It is only needed
on later 2.4, which use the mm->free_area_cache (our old 2.4.9
works ok, but 2.4.20 doesn't).
I still think you are making a mistake defininig your own
arch_get_unmapped_area(), because: 1. sparc64 does it correctly
with the common code, so it can be done; 2. architecture
specific duplicates of common code may bitrot. But have it
your way, I won't resubmit, for the sake of staying aligned
with upstream.
