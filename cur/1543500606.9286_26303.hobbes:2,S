Some people pop up every time saying that the whole idea is bad
because we can't restart network connections. My opinion is always
that it doesn't really matter if we can't migrate 100% of the
processes at first. Moreover, even if we get stuck and never will be
able to migrate everything, then we can still note it in the
"restrictions" section of the manual.
On the other hand, we HAVE the infrastructure to migrate network
connections. On the box where the process is "leaving" we can 
create a masquerading entry that creates a through-connection for
external hosts. If the network connection is towards another Linux
machine, we can have that host enter a masquerading entry for the
outgoing connection.
Anyway, a friend just told me that SGI has a process migrating system
where there are a few "restrictions" in the manual, which indicate
that processes with network connections cannot be migrated.  Ok.
Acceptable solution. Already extremely useful.
