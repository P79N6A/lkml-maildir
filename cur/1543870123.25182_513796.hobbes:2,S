Subject: [RFC][PATCH] intel8x0: revert regression that broke sounds after S3 suspend
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/28/86

The regression in 2.6.19-rc3 (namely 30b35399ceb2398d05837863476dcb12f12f3a82,
"[ALSA] Various fixes for suspend/resume of ALSA PCI drivers"),
broke HP nw8000 speaker sounds after S3 suspend (headphones still worked).
Removing this line makes the sounds work again...

This is a FYI kinda message, which Rafael Wysocki asekd me to send,
and something that is clearly not the correct way to go with this,
but I was unable to locate the actual reason for the regression
and this does fix it for me, so here it goes.
Wether other devices suffer from this or not, I don't know. I was only
able test this on an HP nw8000, which has the said intel8x0.
I'll gladly try out further patches or submit configs, or whatever
more verbose information is asked for.
