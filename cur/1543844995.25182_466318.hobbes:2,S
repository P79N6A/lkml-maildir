If you're suggesting a gzip like format (but with different magic, 
etc.), that's ok.
However, it has been suggested on similar threads to use the CM field of 
the gzip format to introduce different compression methods.
While this is the purpose of this field, I find this to be a very bad 
idea. The worse part of it is that, after "lzma gzip" files start to 
proliferate, you never know if you can decompress a .gz with your 
version of gunzip, which is something that you currently have for granted.
If more formats start being supported inside gzip, this only gets worse...
