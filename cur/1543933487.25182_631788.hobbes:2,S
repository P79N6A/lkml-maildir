Hi Glauber!
    These patches look really solid, thanks!  A few minor things, then I'll 
apply them and push them for 2.6.25.
    My only question is whether we should go further and vpu-ify routines like 
lgread and kill_guest, so that we can avoid more "lg" temporary variables...

OK, that made me laugh...
Thanks!
