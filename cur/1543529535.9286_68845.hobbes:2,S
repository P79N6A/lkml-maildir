Subject: PPP not working in 2.3.??

I just tried mgetty, and to my surprise, ppp isn't working. I keep
getting:
Mar 11 12:38:45 sliver pppd[169]: ioctl(TIOCSETD): Invalid argument(22)
Mar 11 12:44:27 sliver modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module tty-ldisc-3
Is this a problem with the kernel, or did something change in the kernel,
and the pppd people just haven't updated pppd?
With everything the same, it works in 2.2.14. I'm running 2.3.51 now.
