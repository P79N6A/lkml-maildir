What about the following: a vendor provides linux drivers for one of its
products (thanks!).  These drivers simply do not work with some of its
other products (all variants of the same basic product).  There are no
linux drivers for these other products.  All the products claim to be
supported under linux.  This "linux support" is explicitly stated on
each product's web-page whether it is really supported or not.
