the KURT patches can fix this to provide microsecond accuracy from
user space, on the standard kernel.

you're not disagreeing with me :) the reason why the mac/windows DAW's
use external hardware is because the OS they "run on" can't do the
right thing. 
but note: its possible on both those systems for an application to own
the machine in the same sense that RTL does. despite this, nobody has
yet managed to produce an audio application without external hardware
for those OS's that doesn't have latency problems. is it just that
steinberg, creamware etc. are stupid, or is there something more
important going on ? i mean, you really can hard real time as an
application on the macos (even though its not a very friendly thing to
do to the system), and yet ...

i don't think that the Kyma/Capybara offers any API to the user.

mostly because quasimodo is designed to do the same things that you're
talking about, its already written and running, and i'm committed (for
now) to a non-RTL solution to the problems. quasimodo has already been
ported to IRIX, a Solaris port is under way and a BeOS port is under
discussion. for these reasons alone, reliance on RTL isn't very
attractive.
