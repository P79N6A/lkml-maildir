Hi everybody!
I hope that i can steal enough of your precious time to get
your attention for a new patch that adds hard real time support
to the linux kernel (worst case interrupt response time below
5 microseconds):
The proposed "real time interrupt patch" enables the linux
kernel for hard-real-time applications such as data aquisition
and control loops by adding priorities to interrupts and spinlocks.
The following document will describe the patch in detail and how
to install it:

The patch and a demo application can be downloaded from:

Comments are highly appreciated!
best regards
Bernhard Kuhn, Senior Software Engineer, Metrowerks
