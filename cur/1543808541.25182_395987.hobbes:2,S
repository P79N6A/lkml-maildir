On the assumption that this enforcement is considered to be too 
vigorous,  I think that it is also amenable to a fix based on a new 
biased_load() function by replacing the (*imbalance < SCHED_LOAD_SCALE) 
test with (biased_load(*imbalance, busiest) == 0) and (possibly) some 
modifications within the if statement's body (most notably replacing the 
NICE_TO_BIAS_PRIO(0) expressions with (busiest->prio_bias / 
busiest->nr_running) or something similar).
This change would cause no change in functionality in the case where all 
tasks are nice==0.
