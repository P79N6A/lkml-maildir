Hi,
I some make menuconfig Problems within kernel 2.6.6.
When I unpack a freshly downloaded kernel e.g. the Options Mouse
Interface and Provide Legacy /dev/psaux device are missing. When I copy
the debian kernel-config-file into /usr/src/linux/.config the options
are suddenly there.
That puzzles me a bit because I can't get my PS2-mouse working on that
particular machine (AT-mainboard; Gigabyte GA-6BA).
Cheers,
Martin
