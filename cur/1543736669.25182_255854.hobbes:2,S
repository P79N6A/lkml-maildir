i've released the -S7 VP patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc2-mm4-S7
this iteration is mainly a merge to -mm4. (-mm4 includes PREEMPT_BKL so
the -VP patch got smaller again - at least until -mm carries it.) The
patch undoes some more experimental scheduler patches that -mm includes.
The patching order is:
