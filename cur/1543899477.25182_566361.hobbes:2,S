It's in -mm.  The patches queued up in -mm are also in my patchset at

Yes, I think so.

Hmm, I think this would be functionally equivalent to a modified freezer
with the following changes:
(1) the actual freezing functionality is not hooked up to the signal code,
but instead there are many invocations of try_to_freeze() all over the place,
(2) the freezer doesn't wait for tasks to freeze, only sets their TIF_FREEZE
flags and exits, where TIF_FREEZE now means "there's a suspend in
progress, please freeze yourself if need be".
BTW, this is similar to what I'd like to have for kernel threads RSN, except
for the "doesn't wait" part.
IMO, something like this might be used for hibernation too, but in that case
we need to do something about the tasks that haven't gone to the icebox.
I have some implementation-related questions:
* do we want each task to be notified individually or do we want a global
  variable, say "pm_entering_sleep_state", that will mean "now you're supposed
  to go to the icebox"
* at what point exactly this should be activated (ie. before the freezer or
  after it)
* how do we release tasks from the icebox (all at a time or individually, and
  if the latter then how exactly).

This last thing is a good idea, IMHO.

I think we should do something like that in the beginning and probably try to
add some flexibility later on.

Agreed.
