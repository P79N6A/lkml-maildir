 Hello,
I was about to setup traffic shaper to limit traffic from some hosts
external to my network. I was able to setup the shaper, then I brought it
up with ifconfig, removed the default route it set, because I don't want
to limit normal traffic on local network. Then I tried to add
route via gateway to the external host with command like:
 route add -net 1.2.3.4/24 gw myrouter dev shaper0
What I got the following error: 
 SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable
Without removing the network route for shaper this worked fine, can't
shaper use eth0 routes to resolve the route to gateway?
Could anyone help me?
My setup is 2.2.3 linux kernel and I am using route command from net-tools
1.50.
