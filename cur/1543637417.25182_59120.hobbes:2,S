  Hi, all. Version 199.15 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
This is against 2.4.19-rc3. Highlights of this release:
- Switched to ISO C structure field initialisers
- Switch to set_current_state() and move before add_wait_queue()
- Updated README from master HTML file
- Fixed devfs entry leak in <devfs_readdir> when *readdir fails
				Regards,
					Richard....
