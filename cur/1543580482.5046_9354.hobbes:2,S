I tried compiling a 2.2.18 kernel, and when I reboot I get
failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k binfmt-464c
scrolling past the screen.
A web search reveals a comment about 2.3.99pre3, which indicates that it is
a problem with the USB config (video4linux must be compiled in the kernel?).
I am not using USB, and it is not compiled, so I am either misunderstanding
the problem, or there is something else at work here.  I tried compiling
with USB as a module and video as a module (but no specific options, since
it was just a rough experiment) and that gave the same error.  Compiling
without modules altogether wouldn't boot at all (stops after the
'uncompressing kernel now loading' bit).
Am I misunderstanding the problem (there were a few issues reported in the
archived message that I looked at, so it may be that the answer regarding
USB is the answer to a different question), or is there a simple (heh)
config change that I can make to get this to compile?
I would appreciate it if you could CC me in, as I am not a member of this
list.
Thanks,
Josh Higham
