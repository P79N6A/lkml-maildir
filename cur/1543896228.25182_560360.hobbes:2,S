Well, more likely a few more days due to difficult physical access to the 
laptop at the moment; however, it's *not* a regression introduced in 
2.6.22rc, it was introduced at some point of time between 2.6.18 and 
2.6.19-rc1.
That means IMHO it's not sensible holding 2.6.22 final waiting for a fix for 
this issue, but I will try to hurry in locating the exact commit anyway.
