Actually I just want kmod to work. I've mentioned this since I started using
2.1.12? but all I get is read the FAQs/ChangeLog/kmod.txt. I have... it
don't help.
 The best I've gotten kmod to do is *if* I build SCSI support as a module
and insmod scsi_mod manually in rc.local, It will load the tape, cdrom, and
initio drivers automatically when accessed. I can't get it to work at all
with eth0/eth1 and when I compiled SCSI support into the kernel the tape,
cdrom, and initio drivers would no longer autoload.
Please help... I've been using modules (especially for ethernet and SCSI)
for years without problems but the 2.1.1* through 2.2.1 kernels have just
got me beat.
I'm using modutils-2.1.121, kerneld is not running, echo "/sbin/modprobe" >
/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe is being done, kmod is built into the kernel,
conf.modules doesn't need to change (at least from what I've read).
