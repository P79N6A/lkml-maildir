So you are ok with compiler propagating n1 to n2 here:
n1 += atomic_read(x);
other_variable++;
n2 += atomic_read(x);
without accessing x second time. What's the point? Any sane coder
will say that explicitly anyway:
tmp = atomic_read(x);
n1 += tmp;
other_variable++;
n2 += tmp;
if only for the sake of code readability. Because first code
is definitely hinting that it reads RAM twice, and it's actively *bad*
for code readability when in fact it's not the case!
Locking, compiler and CPU barriers are complicated enough already,
please don't make them even harder to understand.
