Well, this is not a kernel function, your Distribution is calling fsck in
the bootup scripts, and fsck is calling the filesystem specific
implementation and this is checking if fsck is needed.
If you do not get this messages anymore contact your linux distribution
provider.
Do you habe maybe a journalling filesystem? Or do you have set some flags to
force the skip of fsck (/fastboot)
