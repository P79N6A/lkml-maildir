This is described on the driver support page at
    
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/vortex.html
You have an out-of-window collisions.  As it explains on that web page, this
is usually caused by some other host being incorrectly set to full duplex,
not a local driver or hardware bug.
This message should have been sent to linux-vortex-bug@beowulf.gsfc.nasa.gov,
or even linux-net@vger.rutgers.edu, but not the general kernel mailing list.
