More PCI than a Starfire requirement.
And there are plenty of ia32 platforms that benefit from MWI, too. 
Often its server mobos that support MWI, but some cheaper ones do too.

Dynamically tune your RX and TX DMA burst settings when you notice these
conditions...  It is indeed possible to saturate PCI bus bandwidth.
