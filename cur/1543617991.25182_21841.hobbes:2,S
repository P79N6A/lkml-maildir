we havent been following this strict rule for some time. We are
distributing device interrupts according to this rule, but only as an
optimization, and only as long as the number of IRQ sources is smaller
than ~30.
i think the worst-case is that we might lose a local APIC timer interrupt
- and this only on older APIC versions. Recent CPUs should handle this
correctly. AND, we have the local APIC timer interrupt on its own priority
level anyway.
So i think the P6 documentation is a pessimisation of the true situation,
and that we can very well have multiple interrupts on the same priority
level even on older APICs - as long as the local timer interrupt is not
amongst them.
