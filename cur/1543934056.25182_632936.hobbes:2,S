The drivers, specifically (the old "don't check if the command FIFO is 
full before writing, just write anyway and if it's full let the whole 
PCI bus stall while the FIFO empties out" trick).
I rather doubt any of those PCI POST debug cards would bother to 
accurately emulate the ISA timings of normal port 0x80 accesses, 
however. Most likely if you plug those in, port 0x80 accesses suddenly 
become lots faster now that the writes are completing on the PCI bus 
before ever hitting ISA/LPC..
