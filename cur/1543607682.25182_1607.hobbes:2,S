I've also had some problems finding a stable 2.4 kernel.
I admin' a few machines, one of which is a DELL Poweredge 6300
(4x Xeon 550, 4GB RAM, 5GB swap, aic7xxx) that is mainly used for
heavy statistical analysis of gene sequences.
Some of these jobs run at 1.8GB/process.
I'm running RH7.1 and (was running) 2.4.3-12 kernel.
The strange thing was, no matter how loaded the machine, no swap
was ever used (??). We started to get a severe shortage of resources
during backups with the message:
mm: critical shortage of bounce buffers (from highmem.c)
(I/O exhausting low memory)
The machine would eventually become so unresponsive that a hard reset was
the only option.
I've just upgraded to kernel 2.4.12 and swap is now being used :)
Stability has been good, even under extreme loads (test was: 3x 1.8GB processes
while doing a backup).
I find it strange that RH latest updated kernel is 2.4.9 but the vm problems
were not fixed until 2.4.10.
Any feedback on these issues is very welcome.
