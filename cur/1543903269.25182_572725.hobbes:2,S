Typically, the EDID creation in radeonfb :-)
In fact, I'm not even sure there's -any- user of those sysfs files. I
added them back then to allow distros to extract the EDID infos that
were probed by radeonfb to properly configure the X server (because on
some machines, the EDID is coming from the firmware/BIOS, not from DDC,
and X can't get at it). I don't know if they ever used them.
In any case, it doesn't make sense to abort initialization of the driver
if for some reasons those files can't be created (for example, the core
fbdev starts exposing EDID files, radeonfb isn't properly updated, name
clash, error). Aborting the initialization will make sure that on some
machines such as powermacs with radeon, whatever error is displayed will
never be seen by the user.
That's a typical, but I have plenty more.
For example, the powermac thermal control drivers. They work pretty well
by themselves. They also expose via sysfs all the current values, fan
speeds, temps ,etc... for the sake of whoever wants to do a GUI or
"monitor" what's going on, but that is not critical to the operation of
the driver. Thus, failure to create those files is not critical.
I have plenty other examples.
Thus, we have two choices here:
 - The simple one: sysfs_create_blah() displays a warning when it fails
and has no must_check
 - The one that adds code everywhere (the current one):
sysfs_create_blah() returns an error, has much_check, and thus all
callers like I described abvoe need to add code to test it and print a
warning. Lots of added .text and .data for little benefit.
Cheers,
Ben.
