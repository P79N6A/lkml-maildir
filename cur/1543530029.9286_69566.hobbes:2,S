Current tulip version does not work with 21041 :(
This is the reason why Alan put two tulip drivers into 2.2.15pre.

IMHO, the problem is not here. The driver goes for both cards (21041/21143)
through the same code but number is hardcoded here.
The following patch helps me (partially) to get 21041 work with new tulip:

This is reversed code from old tulip and works only until link is lost
for the first time.
I was trying to debug the problem (but I have no time to do it now) and
found that tulip problems are probably related to media autodetection 
code. Unfortunately, Donald Becker's drivers generally do not allow
setting media manually and disabling autodetection totally :(((

Maybe because Jeff Garzik have no 21041 based tulip card :->
Jeff, what do you think of putting two tulip drivers into 2.3/2.4 ?
Or do you believe that problems with 21041 will be fixed before 2.4 ?
