We do it head.S instead.  Although the version in head.S is less
complete.

I think just making an arch/x86_64/kernel/verify_cpu.S that can
be included from setup.S wakeup.S and trampoline.S will be just
an exercise in code motion.  It provides a good sanity check in
case things are hideously wrong.
If we are looking at more then code motion then it make sense to
reevaluate and probably drop the code.
Deduping this code path makes a lot of sense.
