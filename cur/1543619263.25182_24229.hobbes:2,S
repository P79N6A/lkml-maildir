 There were no IDE changes in my tree recently, and its strange
 that this only shows up in reiserfs since the new set of patches
 went in. I've no reports from users of other filesystems with any
 problems, so I'm suspecting a rogue change in your last update.
 Finding a common factor seems tricky, as it works flawlessly here
 on IDE [*], but dies instantly for others.
