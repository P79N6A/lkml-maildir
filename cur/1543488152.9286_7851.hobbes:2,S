Anyone else want to comment here? Alan, you've been known to express an
interest in (U)DMA problems before, haven't you?

So your problem's solved then :) Now all we have to do is figure out if it's
the motherboard or the drive.. do you have another machine with a different
motherboard you could stick the drive in?

Hmm, what does the kernel say about your IDE controller on startup? How
about /proc/pci? (cat /proc/pci | grep IDE)

Umm, if (U)DMA is broken for your particular drive/motherboard combination,
you're basically stuck. You can try winging at the manufacturers or retailers,
but I don't know how far that'll get you. But not having DMA shouldn't make
your system unusably slow, anyway?
