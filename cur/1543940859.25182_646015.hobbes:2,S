I no longer get processes in the D state, but there still is a problem with
artswrapper (this is an openSUSE 10.3 system, x86-64).  Namely,
after a suspend/resume cycle and logging out/logging in the user,
artswrapper gets stuck somewhere, apparently in the running (R) state.
For this reason it blocks any subsequent attempts to suspend.
Here's the relevant trace (from show_state()):
[  522.474919] artswrapper   R  running task        0  4805      1
[  522.474922]  ffff810074cd1f70 0000000000000082 0000000000000296 ffff810074cd1ed8

[  522.474963]  [<ffffffff8020c5cf>] retint_careful+0xd/0x21
where, according to gdb,
(gdb) l *__up_read+0x8f
0xffffffff80311769 is in __up_read (/home/rafael/src/linux-2.6/lib/rwsem-spinlock.c:273).
268
269             if (--sem->activity == 0 && !list_empty(&sem->wait_list))
270                     sem = __rwsem_wake_one_writer(sem);
271
272             spin_unlock_irqrestore(&sem->wait_lock, flags);
273     }
274
275     /*
276      * release a write lock on the semaphore
277      */
What gives?
