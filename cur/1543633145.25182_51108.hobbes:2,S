Subject: lilo causes an oops after unloading IDE CD modules

I have an (aging) P5 SMP box which is all-scsi except for an
el-cheapo IDE CD drive. Because I almost never use the CD, I
have the drivers compiled as modules and autoclean them.
Ever since switching from 2.5.7 to (I think) 2.5.9, I've had 
problems with `make bzlilo' causing the system to hang (which 
*is* nasty). 
Today I finally figured out a pattern: immediately after 
booting, I can run lilo as often as I want, no problem. But 
as soon as the ide-cd, cdrom, and ide-mod modules have been 
unloaded, running lilo will result in an oops (not always the 
same one). If I prevent the unloading by mounting a CD, lilo 
runs fine no matter how hard and for how long I beat the 
machine.
My current kernel is 2.5.20 with modutils-2.4.12. Anyone 
interested in hunting this thing down? I lack both time and 
knowledge to do it myself, but am wiling to test patches.
