A little more... regarding where this file actually lives....  Why not
put it in /dev/rd/dac960_gam?
I don't have a GOOD answer to that.  Since I'm using the miscellaneous
device registration, it happens that devfs puts the name in the
same directory with other such devices... nvram, etc.  So as a default
I decided to keep the name with the other miscellaneous devices.
If there's a good reason for moving it elsewhere, I'm open to that.
