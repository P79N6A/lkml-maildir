That may very well be a good thing to do (although if it is too
aggressive we may end up reducing the utility of the dentry cache ---
your patch is going to try to free the dentries pinning inodes, right?
Otherwise it will probably not have much effect), but I think that's a
largely orthogonal issue.  It will still be good to be able to cache
inodes (and dentries), but it would be desireable if we can do this in
less memory than it currently takes, and separating out those fields
which are only needed when the inode is opened, or when its pages are
cached in the page cache, would be a good way of minimizing the
footprint of inodes who only needs to have their stat(2) information
cached.
