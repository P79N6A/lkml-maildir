Sorry, haven't had much time the last few days.  I downloaded the
latest version of the i810 driver.  It works perfectly fine on my
K7S5A board exce.  Both playback and recording.
I also looked at the code.  What do think of replacing udelay(1); with
if(offset == 0) udelay(1); in i810_get_dma_addr since the mentioned
picb problem can only occur if picb == 0?
