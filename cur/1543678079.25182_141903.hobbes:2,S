Having event ordering is a trivial matter, and I'm not against adding a
sequence number to /sbin/hotplug as part of the environment, for example. 
What I worry about is the situation where one big deamon handles 
everything, which makes it impossible to "hook in" to the thing without 
understanding the one big thing.
The thing that makes /sbin/hotplug so wonderful is that it's stateless,
and if you want to hook into it, it's absolutely _trivial_.  Look at the 
default script there in redhat-9 for example, and it's obvious how to hook 
up to certain events etc.
And why do people care about serialization anyway? Really? The whole 
notion is ludicrous. /sbin/hotplug _shouldn't_ be serialized. 
Serialization is bad. You should look at whatever problems you have with 
it now, and ask yourself whether maybe it should be done some other way 
entirely.
