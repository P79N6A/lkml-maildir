  Latest quota interface is able to handle both formats together
(structures passed throught Q_GETQUOTA, Q_SETQUOTA,... are independent
of quota format and Q_QUOTAON takes as an argument in 'id' the quota format
number). So if user wants to stay at old format he can...
  So I think Linus is right here that there's no real reason for keeping
compatibility code in 2.5... Linus, I'll send you the patch which kicks
out the compatibility stuff.
