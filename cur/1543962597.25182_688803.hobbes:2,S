My understanding of having multiple, possibly differnet types of RAID
partitions say on two drives, are that performance-wise this are the
same considerations as for a single drive. You can worry about head
movement and seek times and transfer rates, but the problems are the
same for raid and non-raid. IMHO architecturally multiple RAIDs on same disks
do not introduce additional performance issues compared with single disk
solutions, nor with one-raid-per-set-of-drives solutions.
The above statement on having separate disks per raid is more or less the
same as saying that the more disks you have, the better.
If performance is an issue, then I am recommending my pet
raid10,f2 layout, which has a 30 - 80 % increased performance over
traditional RAID1, because it uses only the outer faster tracks on the
disk, and it has reduced seek time only searching on half of the disk
(and this the again the outer part, so that the head movement is reduced
to about 1/3).
