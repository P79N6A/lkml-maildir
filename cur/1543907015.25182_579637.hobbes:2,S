And again: is CLONE_NEWUSER (to be)implemented for unshare()?
Thanks Eric.  I'm still not so clear though.  What is a user name space
intended to be, and how is it to be used?
Also, when will the implementation be complete?  If not by the 2.6.23 final
release, it seems unfortunate to expose this flag to userspace, since
further down the road, it will be difficult for userspace to tell whether
the kernel below it really supports the flag or not.  Or am I missing
something?
Cheers,
Michael
