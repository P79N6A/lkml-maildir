That's the theory of operation of the current algorithm. I think that we
should do that small change to the current algorithm which allows us to keep
C3/C4 working with dyn-idle first, and then think of a very small abstraction
layer to test different idle algroithms, and -- possibly -- use different
ones for different usages.

I don't think that this is perfect behaviour: if the system is idle, and
there is _currently_ bus master activity, the CPU should be put into C1 or
C2 type sleep. If you select C3 and actually enter it, you're risking
DMA issues, AFAICS.

I know that my patch is useless in its current form, but I wanted to share
it as a different way of doing things.

That's a side-effect, indeed. However: if there _is_ bus master activity, we
must not enter C3, AFAICS.
