Both 'man malloc' and 'info malloc' on my SuSE 6.3 system say it
"allocates memory". At the very least, these pages need some text in
the BUGS section explaining what they actually do.
Also, you describe what malloc() currently does on Linux, but it is by
no means clear that that's what it should do.
Checking the C standard at:
http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n843.htm
I find:
7.20.3  Memory management functions
       ... The  pointer  returned  if the allocation succeeds ... 
       may  be ... used to
       access such an object or an array of such  objects  in  the
       space  allocated  (until  the  space  is explicitly freed or
       reallocated). 
       The  calloc  function  allocates space for an array of
       nmemb objects, ...
       The malloc function allocates space for an object ...
Notice that the standard makes no distinction between calloc() and
malloc(). Both "allocate space".
Earlier in this thread, though, someone suggested replacing malloc()
with calloc() to ensure that space actually gets allocated. That should
not be necessary.
