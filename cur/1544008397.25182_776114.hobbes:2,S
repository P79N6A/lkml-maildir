That seems reasonable.

I think we should definitely merge your 'remove' attribute patch
for PCI functions. That should be independent of the rest of our
discussion.
It will probably help the SR-IOV folks too.

Maybe we should just replace fakephp wholesale with your new
driver?
Or coming at it from another angle, I don't see what benefit
we'll have from keeping both fakephp and your driver. And if
fakephp is as broken as you describe, then it will only cause
more confusion if a user loads both fakephp and legacy_fakephp.
If the user removes a bridge via the correct legacy_fakephp
interface, fakephp won't notice, and we'll just have a broken
mess on our hands.
It would be better to have just one, correctly working fakephp,
even if the implementation is 100% different and truly not even a
"real" hotplug driver.
I think the way forward is:
	- merge in the function level hotplug patch
	- wholesale replacement of fakephp with new fakephp
	- schedule new fakephp for deprecation
	- encourage anyone who wants function level hotplug to
	  use the 'remove' attribute
Thoughts? Jesse, Willy, Eike, Greg?
Thanks.
