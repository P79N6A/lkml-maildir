	Gee, first time in several weeks I *could* get to ftp.kernel.org ;-)
OK, here it comes. I've turned d_add into d_rehash, moved d_add into
dcache.h and added the call into vfat_rename().
	ObChanges in lock_parent(): we'ld better move the calls of
check_parent() into vfs_* ones; otherwise we are breaking knfsd.
	I didn't fix the bug related to 0xe5 and friends (one that I
missed and Albert spotted). Question: WTF DOS does with the names
starting from 0xf6? Somebody? BTW, looks like we have some mess in
fat_readdirx() related to that.
