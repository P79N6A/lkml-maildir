Well, either we're:
1. Falling back and putting all our most recent accesses off-node.
or.
2. Not falling back and only able to use one node's memory for any one 
(single threaded) app.
Either situation is crap, though I'm not sure which turd we picked right
now ... I'd have to look at the code again ;-) I thought it was 2, but
I might be wrong.

Yeah, depends how important those are to the app though ;-) I absolutely
agree with you that the current situation is broken ... we need to do 
*something*.

Right. An app that mmap'ed a big file then thrashed on it would be a good
example, though simple read-write heavily across a small fileset would do 
much same thing.
