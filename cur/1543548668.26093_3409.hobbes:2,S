Hi!
How can I reexport a mount point through NFS without causing too much 
surprise to the users? The mount point contains a removable media      
which can be removed anytime since it is not locked and the gui user
can work the same way as in front of a Windows machine. The system is
Red Hat 6.2, upgraded to 2.2.16-3 (+ide-patch +reiserfs) and
nfs-utils-0.1.9.1.
The old user space nfsd and mountd may have been given a "--reexport"
option and it was done.
With the above config, I tried this, at first only on localhost.
etc/exports:
/mnt/cdrom	localhost(ro,o_root_squash[,no_subtree_check])
I tried this:
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs start
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfslock start
# mount -t nfs localhost:/mnt/cdrom /mnt/XXX
# mount /mnt/cdrom
# ls /mnt/cdrom /mnt/XXX
The content of the CD is visible under /mnt/cdrom, /mnt/XXX is empty.
# umount /mnt/XXX
# mount -t nfs localhost:/mnt/cdrom /mnt/XXX
mount: localhost:/mnt/cdrom failed, reason given by server: Permission
denied
# umount /mnt/cdrom
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs stop
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfslock stop
# mount /mnt/cdrom
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs start
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfslock start
# mount -t nfs localhost:/mnt/cdrom /mnt/XXX
# ls /mnt/cdrom /mnt/XXX
The content of the CD is visible under /mnt/XXX, too.
# umount /mnt/cdrom
umount: /mnt/cdrom: device is busy
# umount /mnt/XXX
# umount /mnt/cdrom
umount: /mnt/cdrom: device is busy
This happens until "/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs stop"
The "unhide" option does not seem to work, maybe it is not relevant.
With manual eject,
# ls /mnt/cdrom /mnt/XXX
shows both directory empty if the "no_subtree_check" is not given.
If it is, then /mnt/XXX shows the old directory content.
If I put back the CD then the next
# ls /mnt/cdrom /mnt/XXX
shows again the content of the CD in both directories.
But when I put in another CD then
# ls /mnt/cdrom /mnt/XXX
shows either garbage or nothing under /mnt/cdrom and the same under
/mnt/XXX (no_subtree_check is not given) or the previous content
(no_subtree_check is given). I have to umount /mnt/XXX, stop nfs and
kill gmc to be able to mount the CD again.
This procedure worked the same with the stock (0.1.6) nfs-utils.
Can someone help? The user would like to be able to umount /mnt/cdrom
or manually eject the CD from under the reexport and insert another
and see the new content (almost) instantly on another machine.
Is is solvable with 2.2.x?

Zoltan Boszormenyi
