How might this play with Paul Menage's <menage@google.com> patch posted
earlier today on lkml:
  [RFC][PATCH 0/4] Generic container system
My cpuset_exit() call is getting popular - both you guys seem to have
designs on it.
Separate question - I guess that your task watcher mechanism, the
way it uses linker magic now, would not enable a loadable module
to plug into these various fork/exit/... hooks.  Is that right?
Such an ability for loadable modules to get callouts on fork/exit
would be useful to some ... it could also be a controversial ability.
