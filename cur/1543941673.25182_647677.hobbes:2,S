In drivers/rtc/Kconfig there's *currently* a list of about
three dozen (!) different RTC drivers ... some of which support
quite a few different variants.
I'd be glad to see someone clean up the config mess with respect
to systems using MC146818 compatible chips, but that shouldn't
begin by assuming the numerous non-MC146818 chips are somehow
not real RTCs.  ;)
