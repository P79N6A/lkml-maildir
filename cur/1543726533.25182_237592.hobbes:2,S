Driver problem.
The driver assumes that the nic generates an NVREG_IRQ_LINK interrupt 
with NvRegMIIStatus & NVREG_MIISTAT_LINKCHANGE on a link change. It 
seems your nic doesn't generate that.
Could you try modprobe forcedeth;sleep 5;ip link set dev eth0 up. Then 
pull out the network cable and check if the driver noticed that with 
ethtool. Plug in back in and check again. With dprintk enabled. Then 
send me the kernel log and the ethtool output.
And add the lspci -vxx -s 00:05.0. Probably I'll make the timer 
dependant on nForce 1-3 and exclude the nForce 3 Gb nics: they don't 
need it.
