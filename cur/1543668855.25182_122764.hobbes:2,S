Subject: [PATCH][2.4.21-pre7] fix APIC bus errors on SMP K7 boxes in UP mode
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

SMP K7 boxes that run in UP mode, because they have only one CPU
installed or are running a UP kernel, are prone to instability
due to APIC bus problems.
These problems occur because the kernel's local APIC code always
resets the boot CPU's APIC_ID to zero, due to a combination of a
programming error and a logical mistake. Since some dual K7 boards
boot on the non-zero APIC_ID CPU, this bogus reset creates an APIC_ID
conflict which causes APIC bus errors and message delivery failures.
The patch below fixes this. The same fix went into 2.5.64. Please apply.
