Same here, applying the two patches in this thread fixed the problem
for me, on my Intel 965P based system. It now does the acpi power off
correctly once again, and I have noticed no other problems with
2.6.23-rc8.
"move acpi_sleep_prepare outside of CONFIG_SUSPEND" and the last
"ACPI: suspend: fix ACPI_SLEEP states"
Thanks Alexey and Rafael.
