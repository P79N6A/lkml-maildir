Hmm?  Look at the page_cache_read() code more closely:
add_to_page_cache_unique() calls __add_to_page_cache, which sets up the
new page to be locked.
The locking is not quite so visible now, but it is still there.  Indeed,
the locking is now done at the lower level precisely so that we can be
100% sure that a page which has been newly added to the page cache and
which does not yet have valid contents is guaranteed to be both locked
and !uptodate, so that nobody will ever look at the contents before they
have been initialised.
