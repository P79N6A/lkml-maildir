Okay, I've been running with 2.4.4-pre1 for awhile now, and although the
driver does hang up on nfs traffic, it still has problems. After running
for awhile, it seems to have dropouts of server hundred milliseconds where
no packets go through. This is somewhat evident in interactive SSH
sessions, and causes clients connecting to the squid proxy I am running on
the machine to behave quite badly. (debian's 'apt' via the proxy is
particulaly bad)
