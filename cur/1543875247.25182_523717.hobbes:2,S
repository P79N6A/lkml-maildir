Not enough information in his report, for example for the
case he says does not work he fails to indicate what kernel
or system type the Client runs on.
Furthermore, his scripts don't even execute properly when
I try to run them myself, for example server.py gives me
this syntax error when python tries to parse the script:
davem@sunset:~/src/GIT/net-2.6$ /usr/bin/python server.py
  File "server.py", line 9
    struct sockaddr_in ServerAddr;
                     ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Can someone help de-crapify this bug report?
