I disagree, on two accounts:
a. For as long as we keep throwing more crap into the kernel, kinit will 
not get merged, because it "provides no new functionality."
b. You don't need kinit and kernel-tree integeration to do this in an 
external initramfs.  You can do this with any number of codebases as an 
external initramfs.
