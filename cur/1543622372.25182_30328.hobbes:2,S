Yes, I saw this & looked over my mail - we had similar discussion
& similar conclusion back in May 2000.  (Others may also find aeb's
notes from this old discussion useful - check the archives)

As a matter of fact, they would have needed to do so even since
2.3.28, when drive->present was no longer set.  Also from that
2 year old discussion is this patch to set capacity for non-IDE
drives. Fact is that ST-506 would even to this day not work with 
the ide driver without this patch. (Of course using hd.c on ST-506
era machines makes a lot more sense anyways, so this is pretty
much moot.)
