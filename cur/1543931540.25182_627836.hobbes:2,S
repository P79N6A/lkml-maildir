...I'm afraid I can't understand: I mean doing the same but without
passing this info with 'work == weight': if driver sends this info,
why it can't instead call something like napi_continue() with
this list_move_tail() (and probably additional local_irq_disable()/
enble() - but since it's unlikely()?) which looks much more readable,
and saves one whole unlikely if ()?
