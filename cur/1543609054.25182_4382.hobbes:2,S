Hi all,
I have several problems with the 2.4.14 (and I know about
the loop.o-fix already ;).
It is normal behaviour that AMP does not work when SMP
is activated. That's why I don't want any SMP stuff on
my laptop which would be unnecessary anyway. But 
deactivating the SMP option causes the compilation to 
fail:
In file included from ksyms.c:17:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.14/include/linux/kernel_stat.h: 
In function `kstat_irqs':
/usr/src/linux-2.4.14/include/linux/kernel_stat.h:48: 
`smp_num_cpus' undeclared (first use in this function)
Do I make something wrong? I replaced smp_num_cpus with 0
since this seemed to make sense to me as I have a single
processor machine. The compile continued but aborted with
another error...
