Sigh...  First of all, the right thing to do is to call try_inc_mod_count()
_in_ get_blkfops().  No need to reinvent the wheel.  But real problem with
that area is not BKL.  It's *!@& damn devfs=only mess and code that does
direct assignment of ->bd_op before calling blkdev_get().  Until it's solved
(and the only decent way I see is to remove this misfeature) I'd seriously
recommend to leave the damn thing as is.
If you can think of a decent way to handle that problem - you are very
welcome.  _If_ we remove devfs=only I have a patchset that moves BKL to
the area immediately around the call of ->open() - see
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/*-S14-pre5.
