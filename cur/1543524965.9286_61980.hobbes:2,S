Subject: NFSv3 client: Patches for 2.3.42 ready (and tested!)...

Hi again,
  The Linux-CVS linux-2.3 tree has been updated with the latest NFSv3
client patches. For once, I was able to cajole the Eepro100 driver
into working with only the odd TX timeout error, and so was able to
test the NFS client out a bit.
  Stability seems very good. The kernel passed both 'iozone' and the
'make -j8 bzImage' tests over NFSv3 with flying colours. I haven't
tried out the large file support, although the patches include support
for >2Gb files under NFSv3. There are also patches included for >2Gb
NLM4 locking support.
  Now I need to make a decent set of incremental patches for
Linus out of this. Volunteers? ;-)...
Cheers,
  Trond
--------------------
NB:
  You may either pick up the patched kernel directly from the CVS
repository on cvs.nfs.sourceforge.net. See the info on
   
http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=14
and
   
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=14
for how to check out the kernel using anonymous CVS. The modulename
for the linux-2.3.x kernels is 'linux-2.3'.
Alternatively, a set of patches are available on
   
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/linux-2.3.42-nfsv3.dif.bz2
Again, please note that in order to mount NFSv3 partitions, you will
need a special version of the 'mount' utility. Patches + RPMS may be
found under
   
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/nfsv3-mount
