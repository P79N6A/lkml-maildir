I have this odd issue with the 2.6.9 & greater kernels, that I can't ssh
or use scp any more, this is what happens when I try:
SSH Error with-in X:
ssh_askpass: exec(/usr/libexec/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory
Host key verification failed.
SCP Error with-in X:
ssh_askpass: exec(/usr/libexec/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory
Host key verification failed.
lost connection
I just get Host key verification failed in the terminal with either
command.
ssh-askpass does not exsisit but it never has & ssh/scp works fine with
2.6.8.1 and below. When upgrading to the new kernel I just copied my
old .config and did a make oldconfig, make, etc.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Dan.
