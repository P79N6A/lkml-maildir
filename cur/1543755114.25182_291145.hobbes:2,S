I have another question whether ip6_output.c is the problem - the leak
is with ip_dst_cache (== IPv4).  If the problem were ip6_output, wouldn't
we see ip6_dst_cache leaking instead?
Anyway, I've produced some code which keeps a record of the __refcnt
increments and decrements, and I think it's produced some interesting
results.  Essentially, I'm seeing the odd dst entry with a __refcnt of
14000 or so (which is still in active use, so probably ok), and a number
with 4, 7, and 13 which haven't had the refcount touched for at least 14
minutes.
One of these were created via ip_route_input_slow(), the other three via
ip_route_output_slow().  That isn't significant on its own.
However, whenever ip_copy_metadata() appears in the refcount log, I see
half the number of increments due to that still remaining to be
decremented (see the output below).  0 = "mark", positive numbers =
increment refcnt this many times, negative numbers = decrement refcnt
this many times.
I don't know if the code is using fragment lists in ip_fragment(), but
on reading the code a question comes to mind: if we have a list of
fragments, does each fragment skb have a valid (and refcounted) dst
pointer before ip_fragment() does it's job?  If yes, then isn't the
first ip_copy_metadata() in ip_fragment() going to overwrite this
pointer without dropping the refcount?
All that said, it's probably far too early to read much into these
results - once the machine has been running for more than 19 minutes
and has a significant number of "stuck" dst cache entries, I think
it'll be far more conclusive.  Nevertheless, it looks like food for
thought.
