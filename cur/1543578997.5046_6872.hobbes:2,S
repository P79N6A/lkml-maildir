	[Venkatesh Ramamurthy]  I think there should be a better way to
handle this , compiling is one of the options, but an end-user should not
think of compiling. The end user needs to put an another card and connect
drives and get his system up and running. He should not think of compiling
the drivers, if it is already part of the kernel / initrd to get his system
running.
