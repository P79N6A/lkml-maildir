Hi,
I just got ECS K7SEM motherboard. ACPI power saving is enabled in BIOS
and works in linux (at least halt turns the box off). However when I
plug in Adaptec SCSI (2940AU) the machine hangs during boot after
loading ACPI core subsystem. The last message is:
ACPI: core subsystem version [20011018]
I have 2.4.19-pre2-ac3 with both ACPI and APM compiled in.  I am booting
with apm=off (otherwise acpi does not load).
It's not really critical, since apm works too. I just thought I would
have access to all the acpi goodies like temperature of the CPU.
                                                Take care, Petr
