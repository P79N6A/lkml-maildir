The removal happens at the union level, not the branch level. Say you have:
/a/
/b/foo
/c/foo
And you mount /u1 as a union of {a,b}, and /u2 as union of {a,c}.
$ find /u*
/u1
/u1/foo
/u2
/u2/foo
$ rm /u1/foo # this creates whiteout for "foo" in /a
$ find /u*
/u1
/u2
Is that what you'd expect as a user? I don't think so.

Yes, since the ODF is completely separate, you can use _any_ filesystem and
regardless of whether or not they support whiteouts.
