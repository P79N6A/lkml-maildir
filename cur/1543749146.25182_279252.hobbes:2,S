Stupid guess here,
The reply got dropped after it passed your firewall and before it
reached the linux server. What you are seeing is simply a retransmit
which would also have happened if the original request got lost, or if
the reply was dropped before it reached your firewall, in which case the
firewall probably would have forwarded the retransmitted request without
a problem.
I would open the window before you throw the piece of garbage out.
