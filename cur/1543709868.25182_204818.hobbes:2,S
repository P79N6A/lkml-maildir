I found them! they are in the binary-only part of the driver but for
some reason they are not getting linked into the .ko file. I tried
linking them manually but then I get an "invalid module format"

At this point I am doing this just to see if it will work... I don't
need the card for another week or so and if I don't get this one to work
I'll just buy another one. Yet I have the feeling that this card will
work before long... if only I could get those files linked that is...
My makefile (dhw, dap, dmgr and dcfg are in the binary parts, present in
the current dir as dhw.o etc.; all the others are .c files that get
compiled during a make):
~    ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
~    obj-m       := nokia_c110.o
~    module-objs := dllc.o dtools.o dhw.o dap.o dmgr.o dcfg.o
~    else
~    KDIR        := /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
~    PWD         := $(shell pwd)
~    default:
~        $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) modules
~    endif

Thanks for all your help so far.
