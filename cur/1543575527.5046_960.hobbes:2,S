I don't think this is the right fix. First of all, if one needed to the
INIT_LIST_HEAD, some new macro should be introduced (INIT_TASK or
something), which takes care of the .list and .sync structures. So when
something was about to change again in the future, you wouldn't have to go
through all the files and fix them again.
But: The INIT_LIST_HEAD is unnecessary and misleading at least, because
tqueue->list is not a list head, it's there to allow for adding the struct
tqueue onto a task_queue. So we have the task_queue, that's the list head
- it needs to be initialized, and that's already done via
DECLARE_TASK_QUEUE. Then we have tasks to be added to the list (struct
tqueue), their .list members don't need to be initialized because they get
set when the task is queued on a task_queue (in queue_task).
So I think the correct fix is just to remove the offending lines.
