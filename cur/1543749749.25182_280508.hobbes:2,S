Zwane,
is there a more scientific approach to this problem ?
See my problem is that I have a very expensive motherboard
and very expensive simm modules which I already inserted and
removed several dozen times. I would like to avoid doing this
experimenting as much as possible. Specially if there might
be a more contractive way. We don't know if there ever has
been a kernel that has worked with this configuration, right ?
memtest86 seems to detect and test all 4gb just fine. So there
must be some way to find the problem ...
I mean you guys must have a pretty good idea what is going wrong.
Is it possible to add some debugging information ? The latest
mm4-jeda kernel seems to be able to "recover" from panics/crashes.
It doesn't "die" it just kills the offending app (at least thats
my limited understanding).
Kind Regards,
rudi
