It's a "mailbox" region, which is a piece of main memory shared between
the driver and the card (allocated using dma_alloc_coherent).

The rmb(); below ensures the compiler can't optimise.  However, I do
agree; tagging the mailbox as volatile would show the compiler better
what the intent is.

I'd guess not.  A lot of these types of driver have what's called a
doorbell/mailbox interface which means that as long as there's a command
slot you get access to the device (or wait for an interrupt to tell you
one's free) but you have to post the command to the device, so you wait
at the mailbox to see that it's taken (usually because the device has to
assign things like tracking numbers or indexes).  The intent is for
there to be a fairly instantaneous response however firmware doesn't
always see it that way ...

Actually, I think a simple udelay(25) might help in a lot of these
loops.
