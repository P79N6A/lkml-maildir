Yes I have a sneaking suspicion it's related to the fact kernel threads are 
fixed priority at the moment in staircase (they dont descend priority like 
normal tasks so act like relatively low priority real time tasks). I'm 
addressing that for the next version so hopefully that will fix it.

Sounds like you need to disable the autoswappiness for this load and set a 
static value. In fact you may find a very high value useful in speeding this 
load up. The older "linear" design for autoswappiness may have been a more 
correct way to tackle it, although desktop users have enjoyed swapping even 
less using the -as patch. To recreate the older design edit mm/vmscan.c and 
comment out line 724 like so:
-			vm_swappiness = vm_swappiness * vm_swappiness / 100;
+			// vm_swappiness = vm_swappiness * vm_swappiness / 100;
