You ignored my observation that by the time this hits distro kernels the 
usual SMP hw size will be 8 or more cores.

Firstly, it's 512 bytes (see below), secondly, with the percpu approach we 
waste far more total memory as time goes on and the average core count 
increases.

I fail to see a problem. It has to be padded and aligned no matter where 
it is - and it is padded and aligned both before and after the patch. I 
dont know why you keep insisting that there's a problem where there is 
none.

The default cacheline size in the x86 tree (for generic cpus) is 64 bytes, 
not 128 bytes - so the default size of the array is 512 bytes, not 1024 
bytes. (This is a change we made yesterday, so you can not have known 
about it unless you follow the x86 tree closely.)
