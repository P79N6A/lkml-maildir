Since it shows up under heavy load that includes unrelated devices, I
think ruling out hardware problems is important.  Some suggestions:
- Use mcelog to see if you're getting any machine check exceptions
  that would indicate hardware error: 
http://freshmeat.net/projects/mcelog/
- Use the edac module to turn on pci parity and memory error checks:

- Run memtest86+ for several loops to make sure your RAM is ok
- Try moving the SiI card to a different slot
- Try running the SATA drives from a separate power supply
- Move disks and cables around to see whether the problem follows the
  disks, the cables, or the controllers
- Try enabling the "spread spectrum" clock option in your BIOS to
  reduce EMI
