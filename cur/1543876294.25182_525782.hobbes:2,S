No it can't. The driver has no idea what the locking rules are for
arbitary command blocks send to arbitary devices. /dev/sg is a *raw*
interface. You can send anything to anyone, and the locking rules for
that are far too complex for a giant morass of kernel code to get added.
The mess begins because you use /dev/sg and put it in a cdrom group
instead of using SG_IO on the /dev/sr device. The mess continues because
of the user of O_EXCL locking thus forcing re-open/close by HAL instead
of fcntl based co-operative locking.
The job of the kernel is not and never has been to anticipate and correct
everything stupid someone tries to do in user space. 
As I said before the people wanting to arbitrate serial ports got this
right in the mid 1970's your situation is not much more complicated,
unless you persist in using /dev/sg - which yes does make it hard, but so
does writing it in COBOL, or while standing on your head. And the
solution to all three cases is the same *DONT DO IT*
