Hi All,
  Good day!
  I have 2.4.4 kernel.  I have to write some system calls for
interaction with the kernel from the userland.  Can any of you tell me
where I can get the information regarding this?  
  I have the Linux Kernel Internals by Beck and others.  But it gives
the procedure only for 2.2.x.
  Moreover I need to implement these system calls as Loadable modules.
  Any pointers in this regard will be highly appreciated and I'll very
grateful!!
  Thanks in advance,
Regards,
Suresh.
