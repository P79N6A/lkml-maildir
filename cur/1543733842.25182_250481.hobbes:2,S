Hi,
How does ramfs offer application XIP ability?
I mean, when the ramfs image is mounted and the application in it is
executed,
"exec", which is called by sh, should first copy every section of the
application to RAM and then jump to the text section.
How do I avoid the stage copying text section to RAM?
Thanks and regards,
Colin
