You don't get the success reports, only bug reports. It tends to work
these days. I don't get success reports, too, but I'm not flooded with
bugreports for distribution, either. (And actually see people using
suspend2/swsusp).

We only started developing swsusp core again at 11/2005. Problem with
drivers is that I mostly do not have affected hardware. [Okay, there
are some problems with Core Duo I can reproduce here, smp-only, but
the machine is flakey, anyway, so it will take some time.]

I thought about it (at around 11/2005), but loosing 8+ MB of ram,
permanently, is perhaps too big price to pay?
