It's correct. You do not need glibc 2.1.x to use kernel 2.2.y

No, AFAIK.

It's NOT minimum requirement. As far as you do not need Unix 98 pty's that is.

Not know what exactly wrong with your system but KSI-Linix 2.0 uses glibc 2.0.7
and kernel 2.2.x. All works just fine (even with kernel 2.2.13).
