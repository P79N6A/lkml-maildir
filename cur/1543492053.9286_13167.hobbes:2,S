Well it's strightforward. I just did the same some time ago for the buffer
hash table. But I agree with Chuck that enlarging the hash size could harm
the hash function distrubution (I should think about it some more though).
I also think that I'll implement the cookie thing suggested by Mark since
I am too much courious to see how much it will help (even if my mind is
driven by RB-trees ;).
