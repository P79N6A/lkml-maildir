Checkpatch already has an error "use tabs not spaces".
And people should realize that checkpatch is not a tool for janitors but 
for authors and maintainers to easily spot some of the possible problems 
in a driver and thereby automate some part of patch review.
E.g. in this driver we are talking about checkpatch warns about the
> 2000 lines over 80 characters.
And that's not a surprise and a symptom when code is 6 tabs indented.
If someone said fixing that should not delay the merge of a 16.500 lines
driver I would agree with that since fixing that would require a huge 
amount of work for a not that big gain.
But that a merged driver contains > 250 checkpatch errors is really not 
nice. Most of them are easy to fix stylistic errors that simply make the 
driver easier to read and whose fixing would only take a few hours 
altogether. [1]
And the 13 checkpatch errors about volatile usage are not stuff for 
janitors (unless you count our number one cleanup person Al as janitor) 
but indicate really fishy code.

[1] one might argue whether "easier to read" really applies when 
    checkpatch gives errors for e.g. the usage of C99 comments, but
    different from overly long lines that's at least stuff that can
    be fixed very quickly and in a quite automatic way
