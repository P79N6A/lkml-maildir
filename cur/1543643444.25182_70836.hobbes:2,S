A somewhat curt reply, it could be seen as a brush-off.  I believe the
whole story goes something like this: the scsi system is a festering
sore on the whole and eventually needs to be rationalized.  But until
that happens, we should basically just keep nursing along the various
drivers that should be using a generic interface, until there really
is a generic interface around worth putting in the effort to port to.
Linus indicated at the Kernel Summit that he'd like to see a
cleaned-up scsi midlayer used as framework for *all* disk IO,
including IDE.  Obviously, what with IDE transitions and whatnot, we
are far from being ready to attempt that, so see "nursing along"
above.  There's no longer any chance that a generic disk midlayer is
going to happen in this cycle, as far as I can see.  Still, anybody
who is interested would do well by studing the issues, and fixing
broken drivers certainly qualifies as a way to come up to speed.

Ah, a little harsh.  I'd say: study the DAC960 driver, study the
scsi midlayer, and study the new bio interface.  That's what I'm
doing.

Yep, starting with reconfiguring the datacentre over here, so I can
run a serial cable from my wife's machine to the to the closet the
machine with the DAC960 is in, because I'll be dammed if I'm going
to do this without kgdb.  Then the serial traffic goes from her
machine over the wireless network to my laptop in the living room,
where I hack in relative comfort.  While she surfs and emails.  Try
that with Windows :-)
That part took a long time because it certain aging RPM distribution
needed to be replaced by a shiny new Debian Sid, and it had to be
done without taking the machine offline, except to reboot.  All I
could wish for now is power cycle over the net, and this will be
civilized.
I suppose my serious work on this will start on Monday.
