If this one still has some problems there is on more thing we could try
before going back to the old way of doing things.
I found this 'gem' in the drm code:
        vma->vm_page_prot =
            __pgprot(pte_val
                     (pte_wrprotect
                      (__pte(pgprot_val(vma->vm_page_prot)))));
which does exactly what is needed.
OTOH, my alternate version of the mprotect fix leaves dirty pages
writable, which saves a few faults.
