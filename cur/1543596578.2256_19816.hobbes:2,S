               ..... This falls through to 
	SIOCDEVPRIVATE+1

Look at tulip_mdio_read() and the zillions of times it's called.
It's called in SIOCDEVPRIVATE+1 when SIOCDEVPRIVATE falls through.
It falls through always, unless there is the -ENODEV error.
tulip_mdio_read() does the bit-banging junk.

    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
