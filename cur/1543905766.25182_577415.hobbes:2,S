I agree.
However, I think using resource_size_t is a bit better than unsigned long,
so that we don't need to check the defination of it.
- res->start = (unsigned long)kmalloc(*size, GFP_KERNEL);
+ res->start = (resource_size_t)kmalloc(*size, GFP_KERNEL);
Is this change OK?

To do great work, you have to have a pure mind. You can think only about the
mathematics. Everything else is human weakness. Accepting prizes is showing
weakness.
