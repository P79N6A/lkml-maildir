Subject: increased unix socket latency from 2.4 to 2.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I have a small test app that simply embeds a timestamp in a message and sends it
to a receiver, who timestamps the receipt and figures out the message delay.
The packet being sent is 40036 bytes long.
In 2.4.20 with default priorities the latency was 302 usec.
In 2.5.63 with default priorities it went up to 841 usec.
In 2.5.65 with default priorities it has gone up to 1210 usec.  If I set
the receiver to a priority of -20, it drops down to about 1037 usec.
Processor is Duron, all kernels built for K7 using gcc 3.2.
Anyone know what's going on here?
Chris
