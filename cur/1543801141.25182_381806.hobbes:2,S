IMO, gigabyte should not have changed the vendor id.  Effectively
they've said they will be the only ones supporting this hardware (not
intel).  Generally subvendor and subdevice ids should be the only
thing changed by OEMs.  Since it was changed by a bios upgrade i bet
its a bios bug and should be reported to gigabyte.
Until then you can hack your local kernel to get around it, but the
e1000 driver probably shouldn't change to support this device ID.
also, this is LKML and mentioning windows is just flame bait. :-)
