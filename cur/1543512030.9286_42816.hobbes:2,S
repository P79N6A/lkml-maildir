Whoever said Unix was the One True OS??? Linux is not Unix.
Linux is Linux. Devfs is quite compatible with the Unix
spirit.
	- It can be configured to NULL via preprocessor defines
	- It uses the VFS for standardness
	- It only makes available a small centrally accessable
	  namespace for drivers to register device nodes, and
	  does not force it's use.
	- It solves problems while keeping compatibility with
	  the old ways
	- When compared to the other solutions, it REDUCES
	  the required lines of code to solve the problems
	  mentioned. (USB, PCMCIA, Hot plug, Device recognition, etc)
	- If you don't like it, stow it!!! CONFIG_DEVFS=N
