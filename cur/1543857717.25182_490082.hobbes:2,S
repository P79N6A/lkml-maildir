Just forgot to mention that your suggestions haven't been implemented
yet. Thats because I'm only gradually beginning to understand the
reasoning and how it might work out in the end. It will probably take
me another weekend (or more) to come up with something fit for
discussion. Bare with me, I'm rather busy at the moment and still new
to the block layer (or kernel code, for that matter).

Elias
