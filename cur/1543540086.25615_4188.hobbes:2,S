Subject: How to do a route lookup in 2.2

Hello,
I would like to know of recommendations for the best way to do a device
route lookup under 2.2, using the following criteria:
I only have available an IP header (no skb, etc), and I would like to know
which device would be used if I were to route a packet back to the source
address in the header.
Something like the old ip_rt_dev(addr).  Can you still do this in 2.2?
thanks,
-bp
