It's still hard -- e.g. i'm not sure your condition flag setting would 
be even possible for i386 SYSEXIT which does not restore EFLAGS
from memory and has some other constraints too. And there is no
free other register to use for this either on i386 nor x86-64.
Ok you could always disable SYSEXIT on force_successfull_return(),
but then e.g. all lseek()s would use the slow path which might not
be a good idea.
