I have a probably annoying/dumb question:
Why does reading something that you don't have permission for from
/proc/PID, such as, oh /proc/PID/mem (normally unless you own PID you
can't read that even on lax systems) return -ESRCH to userland?  You'd
think it should return -EPERM right?
From fs/proc/base.c::mem_read():
        if (!MAY_PTRACE(task) || !may_ptrace_attach(task))
                return -ESRCH;
Why not -EPERM?
