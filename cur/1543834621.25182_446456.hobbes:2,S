Either use a [0/3] mail that describes the complete changeset or just send 
each patch as a reply to the previous one. This way they are grouped together 
in the mail programs. That keeps the inbox clean and the relationsship is 
clearer.

This is IMHO too much data for an in-kernel changelog. I would vote for 
including this in your commit comments, then it will be available as git 
comment and not inflate the kernel tree itself with text that's useless for 
most users. This is really only of interest if someone tries to find out 
something about the changes in this driver and then he's normally also 
interested in the diffs itself.
