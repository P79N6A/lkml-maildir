Only on overcommited systems.

Not really.. all it takes is a guaranteed memory allocation. No overcommitting
memory. Thats the way it works with UNICOS, and I believe that is the same
for trusted HP/UX and trusted Solaris. I have seen it with trusted IRIX.
Processes also can't signal via memory signals this way since the signals
can't be generated.
