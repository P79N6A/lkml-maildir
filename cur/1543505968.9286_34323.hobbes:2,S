Subject: [2.2.11] bttv driver SMP-unsafe?

This may be a coincedence but it seems that if I use the bttv driver for
a few hours under SMP, it will eventually hang my machine but the TV image
keeps going.
If I don't run the driver at all, the box is rock solid.
I can provide details if need be but I'm just curious if people have run into
any trouble with it?
My 2.2.11 kernel is socket-leak patched already so it can't be that. ;-)
