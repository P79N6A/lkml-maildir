Not necessarily; it could certainly catch and handle SOME problems.
(Like an exploding Netscape; they tend to grow quite slowly.)

Yes, it needs per-user resource quotas. We've been over this many
times before.

If you set the quotas, then yes.

Which amounts to system downtime, for that user at least...

Not a practical one for most systems, though.

It isn't going to happen any time soon.
