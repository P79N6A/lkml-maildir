   I prefer pci0 and pci1 in case where these are two really independent buses
having separate host bridges and separate device numbering. For normal
PCI-to-PCI bridge situation, it's surely pci0/03.0/...

   Yes. The 07.0 directory contains files related to the bridge
and subdirectories for devices connected to the bus behind the bridge.

   Any translation will be probably done via physical addresses, i.e.
you translate address on the first bus to a physical address and then
the physical address to address on the second bus.

   I see that it would be useful for ISA devices, but for PCI we can do this
easily without using ioremap_io() if we just translate the I/O addresses
read from the device before passing them to the driver. I'm not sure whether
this is worth the effort or not as I know of no PCI device where I/O
accesses would be time critical.

   I'd like to hear the opinion of PPC people, because in case we can get
automatic conversion LE->BE at no extra cost, DaveM's argument about
readl_be() being just extra complexity with no benefits is perfectly
correct.

   I don't understand the compatibility problem there -- what have XF86_SVGA
and matroxfb in common?
				Have a nice fortnight
