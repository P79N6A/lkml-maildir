Subject: [PATCH] ppc32: Allow PREEMPT with SMP in KConfig

Hi !
On ppc32, CONFIG_PREEMPT wasn't settable along with CONFIG_SMP
for historical reasons (smp_processor_id() races). Those races have
been fixes since then (well, should have been at least) so it's now
safe to allow both options.
Ben.

 config PREEMPT
 	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
-	depends on !SMP
 	help
 	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
 	  real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
 	  be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
-	  Unfortunately the kernel code has some race conditions if both
-	  CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_PREEMPT are enabled, so this option is
-	  currently disabled if you are building an SMP kernel.
 
 	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
 	  or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.
