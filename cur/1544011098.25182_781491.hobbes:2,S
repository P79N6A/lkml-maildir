That's right, you have to fail monitoring.
In this particular example, it is okay for per-thread sessions to each use C1.
Any cpu-wide session trying to access C1 should fail. Vice versa if a
cpu-wide session is using C1, then no per-thread session can be accessing it.
Things can get even more complicated than that even for per-thread sessions.
Some PMU registers may be shared per core, e.g, Nehalem or Pentium 4. Thus
if HT is enabled, you also have to fail per-thread sessions, as only
one can grab
the resource globally.
