Make it use shared libraries (did I already mention that?)
BTW, "a few hundred KB" is really overestimated if it's just about bzip2:
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 27640 Apr 23 02:20 /usr/bin/bzip2
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 66864 Apr 23 02:20 /lib/libbz2.so.1.0.0
That's not even _one_ hundred KB. Oh, just keep it as .so. :)
And of course, compile with klibc, it has less loader bloat than glibc (as 
someone had found out...I think it was Greg.)
