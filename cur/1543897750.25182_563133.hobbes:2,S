I've been following this discussion with some interest, to learn more 
about ALSA. I've been creating startup scripts for all of my sound-using 
applications which look like this:
LD_PRELOAD=libaoss.so exec /usr/bin/alsaplayer "$*"
I found that without libaoss.so preloaded, I wasn't getting software 
mixing at all. I'm constantly running an MP3 player, and with that 
library I can get sound alerts from other apps too.
I don't understand exactly what you mean by ALSA mixing by default. I 
have the OSS Mixer API selected during kernel compiles. Is that what you 
are referring to?
Thanks,
Patrick
