Release 1.9.5: Sat Dec  8 02:47:21 EST 2001
	* Rulebase and help sync with 2.4.17-pre6/2.5.1-pre7.
	* Some edge cases in casting of default expressions are handled better.
	* It is documented that suppressing a symbol suppresses all its 
	  dependents.
	* Correction for Keith Owens's visibility bug.
Keith Owens has an "it would be nice" bug report pending related to suppression
of symbols in the config output.  The queue is otherwise empty.
I'm also looking at the CML1 backport patch.

because they dare not trust themselves, to walk in liberty.
