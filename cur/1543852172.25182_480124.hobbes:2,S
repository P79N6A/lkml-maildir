Correct. The effect of this is to only allow load balancing on one cpu at a 
time. Subsequent attempts to schedule load balancing on other cpus are 
ignored until the cpu that is load balancing has finished. Then the 
others (hopefully) get a turn.
A pretty interesting unintended effect. It certainly solves the concurrent 
load balancing scalability issues and would avoid the need to stagger 
load balancing. Wonder how fair it would be?
