So it is indeed that this driver wants to fail its probe if it cannot
get the firmware. A possibilty to achieve a similar effect would be to
use request_firmware_nowait() and to call device_release_driver() from
the callback if no firmware is loaded. (This would imply a split of
that driver's probe function into two stages.)

Well, at least it doesn't block the whole probing process... although
this waiting is indeed useless.
