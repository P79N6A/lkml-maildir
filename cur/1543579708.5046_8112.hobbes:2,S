Subject: PS/2 mouse problems in Linux 2.4.0 and 2.2.17 on KT133 chipset based  motherboards.

	Hello.  I recently upgraded my workstation from an EPoX MPV3-G to a
Gigabyte 7-VX-1.  In XFree 3.3.6 the mouse cursor will randomly jump to the
upper-right hand corner of the screen and remain there until I scroll the
mousewheel.  This used to happen on the old workstation when switching
between virtual consoles and X's screen occasionally, but stopped happening
when I used X exclusively (with terminal windows).  This new behaviour has
been verified to also affect the Gigabyte 7-ZX-1 and the Asus A7V
motherboards (also based on the VIA KT133 chipset).
	Windows 2000, Windows 98, OpenBSD 2.8's PS/2 mouse handling does not appear
affected on the same chipset, nor have I ever been able to make the mouse
cursor jump to the upper-right hand corner of the screen in them.  The PS/2
mouse I am using is the Logitech M-S48.  This also affects the Microsoft
Intellimouse and other PS/2 mice without a mousewheel.
Please CC me in any followup since I do not follow the Linux-kernel mailing
list directly.
