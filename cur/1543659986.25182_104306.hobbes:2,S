I'm having problems with the i810_audio driver and the ICH3 chipset. 
When playing audio, it skips VERY badly. After stopping the audio, I get
the message:
drain_dac, dma timeout?
The system is responsive during the skipping, so I doubt it's just high
load. I am using 2.4.20-pre3-ac4 right now, but it also occurs on 2.4.20
and 2.4.21-pre3. 
The i810_audio driver in 2.5 works.  
There are no other kernel messages about audio, just drain_dac, dma
timeout? 
Any help with this would be appreciated. I will attempt to debug this
further later tonight. 
Regards,
Matthew J. Fanto
