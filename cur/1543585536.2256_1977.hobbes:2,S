This is normal behaviour for an Oops ;-)

Do you have the full ksymoops decode available? The above is somewhat
minimal.
Also please could you try to duplicate the problem with a standard
autofs v3 daemon? I'm not sure that the v4 'automount' is quite as
well tested as the v3 daemon (it still seems to be in beta).
Cheers,
