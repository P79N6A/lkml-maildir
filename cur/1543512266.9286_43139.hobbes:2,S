But to accomodate vast major/minor combinations you have to increase
the size of dev_t which (by your own words) will breaking everything.
That sounds like too high a cost to me.

Obviously, but I have a whole truck load of SCSI and goodness knows
what else entries that I don't use because I don't own anything to
connect to them. i didn't get any choice about those, my distro put
them there. I could remove them, but the effort involved isn't really
worth it. However, I would like it cleaned up (messy file systems piss
me off ;)

So scrap devfs and write kdevfs ;)

Wouldn't it be nicer to have it done for you?

It's largely transparent to new users because distros create hundreds
of devices so that John Q Newbie will never have to worry his poor
little head about mknod'ing or using MAKEDEV. That's not really
transparent. It's not much of a big deal either. I don't think the
issue here is really the average user and his need for a few devices
here and there, but maximising the potential of the kernel. In the
same way that a tiny fraction of linux users require 4GB ram support,
but it has been put in, so, only a tiny fraction may need thousands of
devices, but it should still be catered for (especially if it then
makes the usage neater for everyone else).

It's certainly a non-trivial problem, but it's not something that
"can't" be done.

and yet you advocate changing the dev_t structure which you claim will
break everything (and worse, it is userspace stuff). That sounds like
a particularly horrific cost to me.

That is an oversimplified example that doesn't address the issues
being discussed here.
