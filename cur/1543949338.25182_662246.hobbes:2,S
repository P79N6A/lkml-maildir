I am not the original reporter, to get good numbers HPL tests cpu and mostly
networking speed (if more than one machine is being used), if local it
test whichever interprocess communication is being used.
It is floating point with communications to sync the different processes
together.
Generally if it is abnormally slow, you either have a errant process
on a machine, a problem with one machine, or a problem with networking
latency, or possibly a problem with some other latency.
I have never seen the scheduler make a big difference (unless the scheduler is 
really really broken), and it if configured for speed it does little or no swap 
(but I have seem machines that were tuned to page out early cause slight slow 
downs in the numbers when things should have nicely fit in memory), and it does 
little or no disk IO in the timed speed calculation areas.
It is pretty much all network latency and floating point speed.
