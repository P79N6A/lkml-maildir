Hi,
Here's a very tiny bugfix for arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c in the
2.4.19-pre2 kernel.  It fixes the problem if there is an error in the
MP_processor_info() function where the mpc_apicid value is greater than
MAX_APICS, then we need to decrement the number of valid processors
before we return (the number was just incremented before the check.)
The patch was written by James Cleverdon.
thanks,
greg k-h
