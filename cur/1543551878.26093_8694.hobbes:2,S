This release is freely available for download at vger.timpanogas.org in
both ISO image and directory tree formats.  This release corrects a bug
in the
anaconda installer python scripts relative to dependent modules.  The
anaconda scripts simply hang and lockup a system if a module is being
installed with mismatched revision numbers.  It now will print an error
if dependency mismatches are detected.  This release corrects the lockup
problem during install while attempting to install the autofs rpm from
anaconda.  We also fixed the autofs rpm.
I am also meeting with the Tux2 patent attorneys in SLC tommorrow
morning, and will provide an update relative to where they are at with
their analysis tommorrow afternoon.
