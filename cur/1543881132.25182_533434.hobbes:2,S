It would be nice if you to provide a sample script. Unfortunately,
hotplug scripts are distribution specific. And internal knowledge of
your modules is required to write one.
For a typical, non-linux-geek user there are just two states of the device -
available and not available. Ububtu is famous for its end-user support.
They ship your driver since linux-2.6.17. But they pack it in one module.
And that is _much_ easier, then a hotplug script.
And maybe, you would care to create a branch in you repository for
in-the-tree compiles.

The scope of your project is exceptionally wide. You plan to develop a whole
new layer for memorystick as a part.
At the same time, the [tifm_sd] code is device specific, and [tifm_7xx1]
code is also device specific. And both modules depend on the same device
(of family of devices). That makes me think that a bus/controller/slot
construction is not going to make thing any easier, but adds complexity.
In case of MMC/SD all abstraction has already been separated by the mmc
layer, in case of MS it is up to you, how to implement.
