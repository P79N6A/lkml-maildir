Here it is exactly the same behaviour.

No, it doesn't work.
Here, the error-log says "the kernel is not configured for PPP or the
kernel modules are not loaded."
I've set 
	CONFIG_PPP=y
	CONFIG_PPP_ASYNC=y
	CONFIG_PPP_DEFLATE=m
	CONFIG_PPP_COMPRESS=m
so the kernel-support for PPP should be there, but it isn't.
Greetings, Heinz.
