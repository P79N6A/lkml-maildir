 If you run glibc 2.1 by any chance, the reason is /bin/sh querying some
of NSS databases on startup.  The NSS subsystem of glibc 2.1 tries to
contact nscd via a Unix socket.  As a result modprobe is being called
again.  This creates an infinite loop which is terminated upon memory
exhaustion which makes the last socket() fail and the shell continues.  As
the purpose of the shell is to invoke insmod on unix.o (modprobe uses
system() to facilitate shell expansion of entries from modules.conf), the
module is finally inserted and processing continues.
 A temporary workaround is to place an entry like
"un::sysinit:/sbin/insmod unix" as the first of "sysinit" type in inittab.
