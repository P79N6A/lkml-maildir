Sorry for missing the statement.

Yes, I think so. The write lock of pci_bus_sem and dev->dev.sem are used in
different steps. Here we use read lock of pci_bus_sem + dev->dev.sem.

Currently, only pci error recovery codes call it while cb are the error
callback functions in the driver. They shouldn't try to apply for write lock of
pci_walk_sem. Perhaps we could add more comments in function pci_walk_bus.
