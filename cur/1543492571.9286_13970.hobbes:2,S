PSET - Processor Sets for the Linux kernel
http://isunix.it.ilstu.edu/~thockin/pset/
Announcing pset/sysmp for Linux/SMP !!
--------------------------------------------------------
This project has undergone a complete, from-scratch rewrite.
The goal of this project is to make a source compatible and functionally
equivalent version of pset (as defined by SGI - partially removed from
their IRIX kernel 6.4 and up) for Linux.  This enables users to determine
which processor or set of processors a process may run on.  Possible uses
include forcing threads to seperate processors, timings, and probably more.
It is focused around the syscall sysmp().  This function takes a number of
parameters that determine which function is requested.  Functions include:
        * binding a process/thread to a specific CPU
        * restricting a CPU's ability to execute some processes
        * restricting a CPU from running at all
        * forcing a cpu to run _only_ one process (and its children)
        * getting information about a CPU's state
        * creating/destroying sets of processors, to which processes may be
          bound
IMPORTANT
---------
Anyone who downloaded any other version made available in the past,
PLEASE get the latest version. This is a COMPLETE REWRITE :)
