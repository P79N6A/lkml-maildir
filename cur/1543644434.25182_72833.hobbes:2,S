Thank you. I was beginning to wonder on this.

Absolutely. In my real profession I deal with statistics all the time so I'm
acutely aware of the problem.

Yes, the IO load is proving to be a pain and I'm afraid it will take numerous
measurements to get some idea of the real average. So far the trends in the
results I've reported I think are still correct. The variability, though, that's
another matter.

I know. Some of the changes I've made to make results reproducible I have
already had complaints about; the situation will only get worse :(
