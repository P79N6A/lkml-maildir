On i386 it is simpler (only one interrupt stack and one process stack)
However there can be still nasty corner cases, like the temporary NMI stacks
that were added recently. It could be probably all handled in a state machine,
but it would be ugly (at least I heard complaints about the x86 code that
does it)
