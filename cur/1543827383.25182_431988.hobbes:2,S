Alan correctly surmised this was due to a VIA motherboard bug and moving
the gigabit card to a different slot solved the problem without the need
for noapic or irqpoll. The issue turned up with other network cards (e.g.
a tuplip and an 8139) so it was fairly clear the issue wasn't driver
related.
Just for the record the motherboard in question is a Gigabyte GA-7DX+,
host bridge is a AMD-760 [IGD4-1P], ISA bridge is a VIA VT82C686 [Apollo
Super South] (rev 40)). At least two of the slots in the machine are
"cursed".
