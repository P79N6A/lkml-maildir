"He's got a bug!"
What's his bug got to do with me?
"He's got a bug!"
I ain't trying to hear that, see?
But seriously (the above might be too obscure of a reference :), my
x86_64 GTOD patches were against vanilla and were not dependent on the
HRT patches. There were a few merge/fixup patches in your tree, but I
don't recall many of them being really interleaved w/ the HRT code. I'm
I missing or forgetting some bit?
Should I just revive the old 2.6.20-rc4-mm1 patches against your current
tree and re-submit? Or should the HRT bits get settled first?
