I have some database processes (Interbase V6) that occasionally seem to 
hang. Using ps or top I found that they are waiting in 
wait_for_tcp_memory. What exactly does wait_for_tcp_memory do and under 
which circumstances does this function block?
I'm using Red Hat Linux 7.2, kernel version 2.4.7-10smp on a dual 
processor machine. Were there any known problems with 
wait_for_tcp_memory in that kernel version that might have been fixed in 
later versions?
Thanks
Gerald
