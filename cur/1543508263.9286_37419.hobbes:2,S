In addtion to the performance, I feel that not-command-oriented layer is 
required, in order to:
  - implement FC/net layer on the top of mid-layer.
    (this may include target mode driver)
  - have better sg driver (ex, abort handling, etc)
I think that current command-oriented layer is not sufficient for control 
all SCSI functionality.
As described in section 'Future Derections' of enhanced sg's manual,
I would also like to invest CAM driver in FreeBSD.
I am not thinking too much, but I imagine below is one of choice.
  step1 : implement CAM layer.
  step2 : make a 'wrapper' of low driver to the CAM layer.
          this wrapped driver is limited in functionality.
  step3 : implement CAM specific low and high layer and
          implemnt net and sg target mode layer.
          It is safer that new sd/sg layer uses different device files,
          in order to leave current interfaces.
Does someone have this kind of curiousity?
I would like to see if my thought is acceptable by linux hackers.
If there is already such a plan, I hope to help it.
Thanks in advance.
