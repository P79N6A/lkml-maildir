nothing is perfect. keeping track of a few sporadic kernel builds with
unsafe compiler with `uname -r` is quite easy compared to keeping track
of every security `uname -r` out there. It's about the common case
working well (common case is like fnclex), corner cases will have to be
handled with a db anyways, but it'll be much simpler to single out a few
spoardic `uname -r` than to keep track of everything in the common cases
too.
For example if a new bug triggers only on a certain buggy future cpu, I
don't want to shutdown the whole thing but I'll have a db that will
single out only such specific cpu if the security_sequence is lower than
N.
But anyways I start to think I should probably rename it to
seccomp_security_sequence, so that it's not going to degenerate in the
sequential patch numbering and it'll really work well for the common
case since there's a seccomp relevant bug less than once every 2 years
or less (and half the time they're hardware related and not a software
issues).
