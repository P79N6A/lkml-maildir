Subject: [PATCH 2.6.21.3] kbuild: fix build for cygwin
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/8/416

From: Tom Enderes <enderes@gmail.com>
The kernel build failed on cygwin hosts, because cygwin has slightly 
different typedefs compared to linux:
scripts/mod/file2alias.c:518: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete
type
Two files, scripts/mod/file2alias.c and scripts/mod/modpost.h, were 
modified as follows:
Whever __CYGWIN__ is defined, __uint32 is defined as __uint32_t (instead 
of uint_32_t) and the missing ElfxxSection definitions are added.
These changes have been tested both on cygwin 1.5.24, hostcc=gcc 3.4.4 
and on FC5, hostcc=gcc 4.1.1-1. Any tests on cygwin, with and without 
this change, were executed with the following set for make: 
HOST_LOADLIBES="-lcurses -lintl".
