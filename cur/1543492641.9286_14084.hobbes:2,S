Users don't have capabilities. What you hint at is the Unix tradition of
powerful (i.e., root) users. Capabilities don't work that way: There are
trusted programs that do whatever check they deem necesary and do certain
things that need enhanced privileges. Anybody (barring traditional Unix x
bits) can run them, if/what they do is up to them.
