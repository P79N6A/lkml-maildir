Agreed. For now I will only post patches for code that really _is_ broken.
I've already learned that from the discussion with David Miller.
This way I might miss some places getting the comparison wrong, but
changes will be less intrusive.
However, I definitely want to see a 2.4.x someday that is able to run
for more that 497 days.
