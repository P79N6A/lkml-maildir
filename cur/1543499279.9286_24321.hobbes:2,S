I also dislike 3com (their isa one's were nice, the pci ones have
feature's) I got more syslog errors about my cyclone in my box in a week
than the dec tulip gave in a year (about 10 transmitter errors on the same
hardware). Intel eepro10/100's have a problem woth multicast when using
the in kernel driver (you need a newer one form Don Becker). I think that
your best bet for price / performance is to look at the tulip clones
(Netgear do one)
