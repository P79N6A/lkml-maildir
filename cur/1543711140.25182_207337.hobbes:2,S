If architecture provides a facility for low power state, we would like
to turn that on in the idle loop to conserve power.  However, in some
specific situation like for performance, it is desired to be off at
least during that period of time.  A runtime control would allow power
state to be managed dynamically to accommodate both.
That's what we are trying to do: to have a sysctl to control whether
CPU goes into low power state or not in the default_idle() loop. In the
generic code, kernel provides a mechanism to set/clear a flag, and in each
arch, we can then test the flag before entering into low power state.

This patch isn't that fancy, nice feature but maybe next step :-)

Writing to sysctl should be a bool, reading the value can be number of
module currently disabled low power idle.  I think the original intent
is to use ref count for enabling/disabling.  (granted, we copied the
code from other arch).

My monkey work, must be not having enough coffee today :-P
