There is an ANSI C equivalent of at_exit: it's called atexit(). Use that 
  instead of OS-specific hacks like at_exit.
No direct analog to at_fork() that I know of, but there's a "sort of" 
equivalent thing you can use: pthread_atfork(). No reason why you can't 
use it, even if your program is not multi-threaded..
