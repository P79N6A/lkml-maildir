Hi all,
	I was suprised today. I found a mailbox in my 2.0.36 to be to
big to be true
star:/home/var/spool/mail # ls -l .ptocarmen.bad 
-rw-------   1 ptocarme root     3221220956 Mar  5 03:17 .ptocarmen.bad
As you can see, it says it has almost 3.2 GB which is wrong:
gallir@star:/home/people/gallir > df /home
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/sda5            7484124 2022590  5073644     29%   /home
df reports we are using just 2.GB of the filesystem.
The i-node information seems wrong, my question is:
1. Can I delete it safely? (I am scared to do it, I even trying to avoid a
reboot...)
2. How can I see what's wrong in the file? I tried to do lseek and I am
getting errors. How can I send you more useful information?
3. May be it was a NFS problem from a 2.2.1 client? I was using NFS for
the volumes, not anylonger due to the known NFS bugs...
Thanks.
