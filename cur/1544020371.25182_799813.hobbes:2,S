I agree, I'm just stating the current situation :-) Hopefully something
like async funcs / slow work / whatever will take over the case of stuff
that wants to be around for longer. I haven't had a chance to look at
the async funcs yet, sounds like they may do the job tho in which case
I'll look at converting a driver or two to use them.

Well, it's a bit silly to allocate a private workqueue with all it's
associated per CPU kernel threads for something as rare as resetting
your eth NIC ... or even SCSI error handling in fact.

I suspect the main reason for dedicated work queues is that, plus the
per-CPU affinity.
