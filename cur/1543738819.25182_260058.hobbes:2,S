That's how it works already, thanks, except that it
does have a few calls to in_interrupt() rather than
simply passing itself a flag parameter to convey the
same information -- I'll fix that now.
Except that it uses schedule_work() rather than a tasklet.
The bottom half is only there for abnormal conditions
like major chip errors and hotplug events.
So the only new suggestion here is to use a tasklet for
the bottom-half processing rather than schedule_work()?
I thought work queues were the preferred mechanism for
infrequent uses such as this these days?  A tasklet is no
problem here though, so long as worker threads (schedule_work)
do not also rely on tasklets.
