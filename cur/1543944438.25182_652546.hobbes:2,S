So this driver plays party tricks with memory allocation and the C type
system.
We could at least add
	struct resource resources[0];
to the end of `struct sm501_device' to avoid the type abuse.  Or we could
even get radical and splurge four bytes on a `struct resource *'.  But
please, not this.
Oh well. A pre-existing problem.
