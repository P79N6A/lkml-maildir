This is a chicken/egg type problem.  A lot of raid controllers can't be
managed until a lun is created (since there aren't any devices).
Some work around this by having a pass through driver that is installed to
configure the array.  Once this is done, the driver is removed.
A lot of lower-end controller boards just use dos utilities, but many
higher end / external controllers just don't work that way.
