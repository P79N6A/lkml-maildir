Um I don't think chucking X is the answer.  The problem is that it's
embarassingly slow compared to any modern GUI.  If the display were as
snappy as WinXP I don't care if it's 200MB.  On my desktop I constantly
see windows redrawing every freaking widget in situations where XP would
just blit from an offscreen buffer or something.
Anyway please keep replies off LKML and on the Xorg list...
