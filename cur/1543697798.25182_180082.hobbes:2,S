   That's the point of my question. I know a few about MM in Linux. As I 
understand memory accounting is most complicated: 1st how to account 
kernel allocatable memory, 2nd how to reliably calculate already 
allocated memory. (1st looks like not present even in 2.6, 2nd not 
present in 2.4.)
   As I understood, default overcommit_ratio=90% is made especially to 
protect kernel from running out of memory. And 2.6 does offset available 
memory by 3% for all non-root allocation checks.
   But I cannot find any similar accounting stuff in 2.4...
   Hard to draw parallels.
   Will appreciate any advice.

  Because the kernel depends on it existing. "init"          |_|*|_|
  literally _is_ special from a kernel standpoint,           |_|_|*|
  because its' the "reaper of zombies" (and, may I add,      |*|*|*|
  that would be a great name for a rock band).
