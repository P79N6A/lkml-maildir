Current Linux driver switches them to 16bit mode in pcnet_probe1:
pcnet_dwio_reset(); // reset to 16bit mode when in 32bit, ignore in
16bit mode
pcnet_wio_reset();  // device is for sure in 16bit mode, but reset it
again to 
                    // get it into known state if we were in 16bit mode
already
So you should find hardware always in 16bit mode at this point. If it
does not work, maybe you need to xor PCNET32_WIO_* values with 2 on
PowerPC...
