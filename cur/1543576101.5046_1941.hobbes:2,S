Ick, we've previously had issues with using the defrag routine from
PRE_ROUTING (Andi fixed the `called without bh disabled' problem). 8(
Good news is that it's all done from one place:
net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_core.c:910:ip_ct_gather_frags(struct sk_buff *skb)
You can fix it to obey the rules there, rather than hacking fragment
code.
Cheers,
Rusty.
