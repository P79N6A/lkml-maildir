Only if people continue to work on new stuff during the "bug fixing only" cycle.
If we manage to get everyone focused on bug fixing only for the entire
cycle the backlog won't be growing (much).

Yes, MANY are false, and I know the rest are getting worked at, I work
on some myself when time permits.
I mentioned it simply as an indicator (one amongst many) that we have
a lot of known unfixed issues.

My point was "get people to suspend their work on new features and
focus entirely on bugfixes for a single cycle", so we get more
manpower working on fixing all those known issues we have before we
move on with new features.

True. I'm looking forward to that.

Ok, I may be on thin ice here, but that contradicts my personal
experience. I see a lot of very nice improvements in recent 2.6
kernels, but I also see a greater need for careful testing before
deploying on the systems I'm responsible for - I feel that I'm running
into more "whoops that kernel wasn't quite fully baked" situations
recently (and yes, I do try to report and/or fix those issues when I
encounter them).

Let me make one very clear statement first: -stabel is a GREAT think
and it is working VERY well.
That being said, many of the fixes I see going into -stable are
regression fixes. Maybe not the majority, but still, regression fixes
going into -stable tells me that the kernel should have seen more
testing/bugfixing before being declared a stable release.
All I'm trying to say is that we have a number of known bugs, a number
of known regressions, a number of known inefficiencies. Maybe, just
maybe, we should focus a little more on that and a little less on new
features, new hardware support etc. Not permanently - overall I think
the 2.6 model is working great - but just for a single kernel release
cycle every now and then.  And why not just try it once as an
experiment? We'll never know if it's a good idea if we don't try it at
least once.
