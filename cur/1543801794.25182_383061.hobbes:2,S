kbuild rely on the gcc feature that generates a dependency file
using: -Wp,-MD,<file>
This is broken when adding several .c files.
It looks like gcc generate a new dependency file for each and every
input file overwriting the old one. Obviously caused by gcc being
invoked once for each input file in my version of gcc.
gcc --version:
gcc (GCC) 3.4.4 (Gentoo 3.4.4-r1, ssp-3.4.4-1.0, pie-8.7.8)

Anyone that knows how I can enable gcc 4.x for kernel builds on a gentoo
box without changing gcc for everything else?
I could install a vanilla gcc but too bored to do so.

The most noticeable difference will be when it has to compile all files
for a module when a single file changes. And cccache will not save us in
this case.

Even with an ICE it may be wortwhile to do a allmodconfig build just to
get an overview of type inconsistencies - no?
A quick grep shows that we have 3300 extern functions in .c files in the
kernel :-(
