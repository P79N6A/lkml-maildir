This gives several oopses on my system during boot, after which is seems
dead.
2.6.1-mm4
VIA C3 Ezra
It mounts its root filesystem over nfs and has netconsole compiled in.
Without the REGPARM option the system boots and runs fine.
Should I post the oopses, the result of ksymoops, a dmesg and kernel
config or is this an already known issue?
Kind regards, Sander
