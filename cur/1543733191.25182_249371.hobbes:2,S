Nope, when I start the server it is running (waiting
for communication. When the client connect it is still
running (it print some thing like begin loop
request..). It only exited to the bash prompt without
any message. The syslog has a message (just found it)
nbd_server[16808]: Request too big!
probably is the reason why the server exited.

I am sure the file is ok ; the communication is ok. As
later I succesfully ran enbd reliably (only with
2.4.27 in client, the 2.6.7 OOPs) so we can confirm
the TCP is good AFAIK enbd uses the same protocol. Can
ssh between the two machine, can http (run web browser
in client and access a page served by the server box
vise versa).
I will do more testing today. I need 2.6.8 kernel in
the client.
Kind regards,
