	So I'm still wondering what the "approved and recommended" way for a program
to be "automatically" informed of a CD or floppy change/insertion and be able to
informed of media 'type' w/o kernel warnings/error messages.  It sounds like
there is no kernel support for this so far?
	Then it seems the less ideal question is what is the "approved and recommended
way for a program to "poll" such devices to check for 'changes' and 'media type'
without the kernel generating spurious WARNINGS/ERRORS?
