I later remembered one more reason why I'd tried this out -- it
enabled me to play with async handling of page faults (i.e. an
async fault_in_pages .. or a retriable copy_xxx_user). I didn't
want to inclue that code until/unless I saw some real gains, so its
not an important consideration, but nevertheless it was an
added flexibility.
BTW, does making this a wait queue entry pointer rather than iocb 
pointer sound any better (i.e tsk->io_wait instead of tsk->iocb) ? The
code turns out to be cleaner, and the semantics feels a little
more natural ... (though maybe its just because I've become used
to it :))
