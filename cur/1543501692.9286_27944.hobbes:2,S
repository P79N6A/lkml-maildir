The main memory on a K6 is handled seperately to the MTRR's. So you have
one for the video, and one to mask out the mmio space (or one for video
and one for texture maps)

The memory case is handled by the BIOS. Its seperate to the MTRR. If it is
misconfigured by the bios (eg modern K6-2 in an older board) the kernel
actually goes and sets it during boot too.
