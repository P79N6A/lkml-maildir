And so does openSUSE 10.2:
ichi$ ldd /bin/mount
        libblkid.so.1 => /lib/libblkid.so.1 (0xa7f4f000)
Interestingly enough, SUSE Linux 10.1 i586/x86_64 had it statically
ccg$ ldd /bin/mount
        libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00002b489072e000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x0000555555554000)
        (that's all folks)
Now what puzzles is that FC6's mapping address is quite 'off' - the
host "think" has it near PAGE_OFFSET (0xc0000000), as does "ichi"
(PAGE_OFFSET=0xb0000000), so what's with "sandman"?
