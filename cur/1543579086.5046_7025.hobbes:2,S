Subject: Where to get reiserfs-utils?

www & ftp.namesys.com seem to be down (or at least I get "no route to host) so I
can't go look there.
I get the impression that with previous patches utilities like "mkreiserfs" were
in
linux/fs/reiserfs/utils, but now that ReiserFS is in the main kernel tree the
utilities aren't there.
I've searched everywhere to find a mirror that would have a matching set of
utilities to what's in the kernel (Hans Reiser warns about the need to keep
versions in sync in his README) but I can only find older patches, no current
reiserfs-utils.
Does anyone know where there is a mirror?
Another question: I'll try it when I get the utilities, but do you know if it
should work to mount a ReiserFS filesystem using loopback from a regular file in
an Ext2 filesystem?  Yes this sounds like a silly thing to do (journaling on top
of non-journaled storage) but is a safe way to exercise the code.  I don't have
an extra partition handy to try it out on, and I don't want to use it on my real
files yet.
Thanks,
Mike
