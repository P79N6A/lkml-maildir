My bad again while tring to figure out if the drive present flag upset a
geometry interrupt call at INIT/PROBE/CHIPSET tuning.
It turned out that one only needs to stoke the GET_STAT(), else the
pending return barfs on the geometry calls since the drive is not ready.
In forgetting the reason why we agreed to stub it out, I thought I did it
while bug hunting for why some chipsets issued an exception thus
geometry_intr error.
Please give me some text to comment around the stub to keep my memory intact.
I remember now about the BIOS nuking........duh.........now where did that
go to again ;-)
