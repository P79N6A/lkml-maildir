I just want to add that I AM capable of working with the other 
filesystem developers in a team-player way, and I am happy to cooperate 
with making portions more reusable where there is serious interest from 
other filesystems in that, but Christoph is a puppy who has never 
written or designed a major filesystem from scratch, and Nikita is a big 
dog who has written stuff very few projects are lucky enough to see the 
likes of, and when Christoph insults Nikita's code, or my design 
guidance for that code, it is not going to bring out my good side.  The 
plugin and metafiles code needs many improvements, but Christoph does 
not have the expertise to understand what those needed improvements are 
because he hasn't invested the work into understanding the code.
Christoph is a bright and clever young fellow, who just hasn't had the 
years of study of the field yet.  I wish him well, and away.;-)
