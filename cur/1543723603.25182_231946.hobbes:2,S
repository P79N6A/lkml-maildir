The default flags for .text and other code sections are "AX" for both
hppa64-hpux and hppa-linux.  Thus, unless someone explicitly removes
PROT_READ, there isn't a problem reading the offsets in the jump tables.
Having jump tables containing data in the code sections is relatively
new on HPPA.  There were problems with the previous implementation in
which the jump tables contained code.
It would be possible to put the jump tables in .rodata.  The reasons
why the jump tables ended up in the code sections are:
1) The instruction sequence to load the start of the table is about
   three instructions shorter.
2) The tables contain absolute offsets.  In order to put the tables
   in .rodata, we needed support for 32 and 64-bit pc-relative
   relocations in binutils.  I added this support to binutils a few
   months ago.  However, I decided that I didn't want to require
   an update to a non-released version of binutils in order to build
   and use GCC.
3) There weren't any problems putting the tables in the code sections
   under hpux.

The jump table instructions use the standard HPPA load instructions
(i.e., there is no difference in a read to .text or .data aside from
the protection flags that have been set for the page).
The tool chain only controls the setting of SHF_ALLOC, SHF_EXECINSTR,
SHF_WRITE, ...  There isn't any control over whether a section can be
read or not as far as I can tell.
