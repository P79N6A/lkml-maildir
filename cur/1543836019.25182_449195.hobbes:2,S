That sort of thing - i.e. using __get_cpu_var on something which isn't
just a simple variable name - works with the current per-cpu macro
definitions, because they are pretty simple, but one can imagine other
reasonable implementations of __get_cpu_var which need the argument to
be a simple variable name.  I struck this when I was experimenting
with using __thread variables for per-cpu data.
