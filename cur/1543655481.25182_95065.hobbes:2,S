Linus,
any chance you could pull James' updates?  He has been sending fbdev updates
that fix known issues with many drivers for a long time but I can't even
remember when you merged it the last time.  Most fbdev drivers are pretty
unusable in mainline without his fixes.
James,
could you please provide diffstat output, bk changes -L output and a
unified diff for review of the actual changes?
