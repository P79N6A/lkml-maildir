So these variables are __read_hot_write_cold?
In other words, the name __read_mostly is a little misleading, in my
book.  That name only suggests read much more than written.  In your
words:
    something like 99:1 read
It doesn't state that the variable is so "read hot", it is worth keeping
off "write hot" cache lines.
Let's say for example we have a variable is accessed only once per
hour, and that this access is always a read except once a week (once
every 168 hours) when it is a write.
I would not mark that variable __read_mostly, even though it passed
your 99:1 test.  That variable is read_cold_write_evencolder.  It's an
ideal candidate for the canon fodder that we use to fill up the rest
of a cache line that has a hot variable.
If Andrew's suggestion to remove __read_mostly doesn't fly, then I'd
vote for a name change:
  __read_mostly ==> __read_hot_write_cold
I think we want to identify the hottest memory words, keeping them
on separate cache lines, except that __read_hot_write_cold words can
share cache lines with each other.
A given cache line would have at most one hot write word, or one or
more read hot, write cold words.
