I agree. And it's not like you can get it wrong, since if you only give 
the "page" argument, the preprocessor will complain loudly.
I think "sg_set_x()" is now rather logical - we fill in the SG entry 
(entirely), and the only question is _how_ we do it (which is what "x" 
says - using a page, or a kernel buffer).
