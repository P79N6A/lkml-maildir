Andrew, I can now happily say that you've made my day. One of the very first
goals I put up when starting to learn C was to get code of my own included in
the Linux kernel, wether it was a simple fix or whatever. These are the first
patches from me that was included (although I can't take credit for any of
them), so I guess the reading it took to learn C was definately worth it.
On top of that, I'd like to thank you for the work you're putting in. This
whole process couldn't go smoother, and I'm sure almost everyone agrees on
that.
My next goal is the vanilla kernel, and after that, (maybe) some code of my
own. For now, I'm celebrating with a glass of water and a soft bed. Cheers.
