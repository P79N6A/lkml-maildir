Well, not from the start, but I think at some point in the fufure it would.

We would have to change the interface for that and I don't want to do it.

Sure, it would.

That's true, but I assume that the people who opt for doing that are also
willing to take part in the review of the drivers. :-)

Well, if we change the design to fail by default, the authors of new drivers
will only have to flag them if they believe that the drivers are
suspend/resume-safe.

Well, I don't think so.  Let's estimate the number of drivers that define
.resume() right now:
$ grep -I -l -r '.resume =' linux-2.6.20/drivers/ | wc
    102     102    4169
And I think there are much more drivers that really work fine with respect
to the suspend/resume.
This indicates that in fact many drivers can be marked as known good even
though they don't define the .suspend() or .resume() routines.
Greetings,
Rafael
