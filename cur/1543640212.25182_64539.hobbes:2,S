A few more observations and maybe a solution for the problem
(kernel is 2.4.20-pre1-ac3):
I ran Richard Gooch's scheduler benchmark[1] as a normal user with
num_running set to 50 (./a.out 50). The box locks up hard within a few
seconds. There is no Ooops, Magic-SysRq doesn't work anymore, neither does
console switching or Ctrl-Alt-Delete. NMI-Watchdog is enabled and failed
to reboot the box.
This suggests that sched_yield, nice or sched_setscheduler is involved
with sched_yield beeing #1 candidate.
Further investigation showed that adding BUG_ON(p->array != array);
in dequeue_task would have given some interesting results.
At least the following is quite possible and doesn't even require SMP:
      Task                          Interrupt
Calls sys_sched_yield
      ======> Timer Interrupt
				    Timer Interrupt decreases times lice,
				    the time slice expires and the task is
				    moved to the expired array.
Continues with yield.
Assume current->prio == MAX_PRIO-1,
current->time_slice <= 1 is satisifed
anyway, i.e. wie do:
   dequeue_task(current, rq->active);
   enqueue_task(current, rq->expired);
However, the task has already been moved
from the active to the expired array
by the timer interrupt, i.e.
dequeue_task and enqueue_task will get
the nr_active counts and the bitmaps
wrong because they remove the task from
the wrong array.  --> BOOOM
The (untested) patch below should correct this problem along with
a locking oddity (last hunk) that IMHO either needs fixing or a BIG
comment. Be prepared for a few (up to 4) lines of fuzz due to additional
BUG_ONs in both versions of the file.
