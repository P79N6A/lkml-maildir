I've been looking for pata support for the SIS180. If you can handle that
or tell me how i might get it, I'd be interested. Here's the revevant

I guess sata_sis is not going to support the pata drives. I've tried
the ones from sis too. This is a real SIS180 on a Jetway S755MAX. Any
chance in hell of getting a driver for the pata ports on this thing? I
tried patching and renaming sis5513.c and got it to compile into a kernel
as a module (s180ata) after putting it in kconfig, but It didn't work. I'm
obviously drowning not being a C programmer. I think it conflicted with
the real sis5513 for one thing.:-)
