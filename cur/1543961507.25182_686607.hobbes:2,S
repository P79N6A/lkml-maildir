Kind of an inadequate changelog ;)
Is this a fix or an enhancement or what?

These are racy in the sense that multiple simultaneous calls to
create_cq/create_qp might end up exceeding the ehca_max_cq limit.  Is
that an issue?
You could close the race by using atomic_add_unless() and testing the
return value (and being careful to do atomic_dec() on error paths after
you bump num_cqs/num_qps).
