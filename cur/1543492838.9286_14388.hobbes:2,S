Maybe it's an idea to add this change to kernel/sched.c::goodness()
                if (p == prev)
                        weight += 1;
        }
-->
	else if (p->processor != this_cpu)
		weight = -1;
<--
        return weight;
}
This makes sure that a proces that has run out of time slice
doesn't switch CPU just yet (because it's at the head of the
run queue or something silly like that).
I think it won't affect the code path or the scheduling
behaviour very much, except for the fact that it'll cause
processes to stick to their CPU much better.
I'll add it to my patch tonight and see what happens...
