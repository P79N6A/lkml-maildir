Actually it works very well. The patches are also not _that_
complicated. We have two kinds of patches:
    1) if possible on the chipset, disable boot irqs (if in APIC mode)
       - this works as designed and has no problems
       - we cover up for broken BIOSes here that forget to disable boot
         irqs
    2) if we cannot disable boot irqs, disable the original interrupt
       line and only use the boot irq line -> no duplicated interrupts,
       but increased interrupt sharing
       - this is a hack for older, but widely used chipsets
       - we cover up for broken hardware (wrt threaded IRQ handling)
       - when the broken hardware falls out of use, this is not needed
         anymore
The only limitations we have so far:
    - For newer chipsets, we have to make sure that we find the disable
      bit. Vendors should put this bit in a common place.
    - It is a lot of work to describe all of the findings and
      experimental results we had, in a digestable way.

Love this. *grin* :)
