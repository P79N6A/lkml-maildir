   Anybody (Ted, maybe) know if the fix described in the June 97 post
   works with current kernels?  Did something else happen to the serial
   driver?  I fear doing what Ted suggests in the post, as he warns of
   "MASSIVE FILESYSTEM DAMAGE".
If your IDE controller is doing Programmed I/O (PIO) and not DMA, then
using "hdparm -u" will probably help you out, yes.
The only way you'll find out whether or not you have the broken hardware
is to backup your machine and try it.  You probably won't --- there
weren't *that* many broken IDE controllers made, so the disclaimer is so
that people don't get upset at me (or try to sue me, given the litigious
nature of the U.S.) if they try it and it screws up their hard disk.
Back up your disk, use hdparm -u, do some heavy serial I/O, and some
disk activity at the same time, and afterwards, shutdown your machine
and force an fsck of your disk.  If it comes out clean, you should be
fine.
