Likely already too late then -- if critical state is overwritten
you crashed before. Also a lot of stack intensive codes
relatively large unused holes so it might miss the canary completely
Anyways if you want a crash on context switch in the non
hole case you can probably get it by just rearranging thread_info a bit.
e.g. put preempt_count first. Any corruption of that will lead
to schedule complaining.
Don't think it is worth it though.
I suppose one could have a CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_OVERFLOW that gets
the stacks from vmalloc which would catch any overflow with its
guard pages. This is you would need to change __pa() to handle
that too because there might be still some drivers that do
DMA on stack addresses.  Would be somewhat ugly but doable.
But I have my doubts it is worth it again -- in my experience static
analysis works well enough to trace them down and 
there are not that many anyways.
