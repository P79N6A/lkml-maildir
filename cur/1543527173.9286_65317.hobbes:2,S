All file contents default to zero anyway, so just ftruncate() the file
to create as much demand-zeroed mmapable memory as you want.

The only way is to use Chuck Lever's madvise() patches:
madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) is exactly what you need there.  It's not yet in
Linus's 2.3 tree, but the API is pretty standard.

No, if the mmaped area has already been flushed to disk then there is no
way at all to recreate the hole except by truncating and then
re-extending the file (which destroys everything until EOF, of course).
