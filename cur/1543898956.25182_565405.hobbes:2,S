What are they doing to reproduce it?  How much setup does it take?

That could be consistent with the theory that we're racing with the  
dio struct being freed and reused before it's tested in the BUG_ON()  
condition.  Suparna's suggestion to sample dio->is_async before  
releasing the refcount and using that in the BUG_ON condition is a  
good one.
