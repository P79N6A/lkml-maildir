Well, that's currently expressed as a reserved pool with watermarks,  
so with a PI system you would have a single pool with some collection  
of reservation watermarks with various priorities.  I'm not sure what  
the best data-structure would be, probably some sort of ordered  
priority tree.  When allocating or freeing memory, the code would  
check the watermark data (which has some summary statistics so you  
don't need to check the whole tree each time); if any of the  
watermarks are too low with relative priority taken into account, you  
fail the allocation or move pages into the pool.

Well the point would be that the priorities could force a more- 
extreme and selective OOM (maybe even dropping dirty pages for  
noncritical filesystems if necessary!), or handle the situation  
described with the IPSec daemon and IPSec network traffic (IPSec  
would inherit the increased memory priority, and when it tries to do  
networking, its send path and the global receive path would inherit  
that increased priority as well.
Naturally this is all still in the vaporware stage, but I think that  
if implemented the concept might at least improve the OOM/low-memory  
situation considerably.  Starting to fail allocations for the cluster  
programs (including their kernel allocations) well before failing  
them for the swap-fallback tool would help the original poster, and I  
imagine various tweaked priorities would make true OOM-deadlock far  
less likely.
