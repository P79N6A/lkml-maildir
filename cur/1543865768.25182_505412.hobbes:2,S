It works both ways. If I don't need to know that I must select SCSI then
it turns on easily. If I want to turn SCSI off then it causes mayhem. Two
sides of the same coin.
What is missing from the current config tools is that when you try and
turn SCSI off you can't. If there is a "really turn it off" button, then
you get told
	Disabling SCSI will disable
		USB scanner
		Foo
		Bar
	Disable Y/N
it fixes Dave's problem. 
There are great examples of this - trying to kill off the I2C bus in a
small build is one of the most painful. Yes users shouldn't need to know
to turn it on, but it does need a way to turn it back off sanely.
