I was just pointing out the practical reality.
The proper implementation of the hook is likely /not/ a dummy on your 
platform.
I presume you clear the interrupt condition by reading the ATA shadow 
register 'Status', like most other SFF-like controllers, so your 
implementation of ->irq_ack() should reflect that.
The proper implementation is basically what Alan described: 
ata_irq_ack() minus the BMDMA bitbanging.
