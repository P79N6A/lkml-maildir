 You should probably use a bit mask.  It seems X86_FEATURE_VME is best for
Intel CPUs as all Intels that have CR4 implement this feature while there
exist Intel CPUs that do have CR4 but do not support X86_FEATURE_PSE.  But
I am not sure about other vendors. 
 To be on the safe side I would test features that have their respective
CR4 bits and assume it's present whenever any of them is set.  AFAIK, the
appropriate mask is: (X86_FEATURE_VME | X86_FEATURE_DE | X86_FEATURE_PSE |
X86_FEATURE_TSC | X86_FEATURE_PAE | X86_FEATURE_MCE | X86_FEATURE_PGE |
X86_FEATURE_FXSR | X86_FEATURE_25).
 X86_FEATURE_25 will probably called X86_FEATURE_XMM one day.
