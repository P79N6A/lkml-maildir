I've been trying to get programming information out of Intel for
months now. I have a development kit that we use for our own i960Rx
boards and would work dandy with this board, I just need a few more bytes
of information to write a board support interface.
I have a case # and everything. If anybody can shake loose the information
I need, I can get the ball rolling.

And a correct guess, sorta.
Actualy, the i960Rx has a few mode pins that tell it what to do at
reset time. The options are:
	start the processor and retry all the configuration cycles,
	start the processor and pass all the configuration cycles,
	hold the processor and pass configuration cycles.
The last 2 leave the bridge acting like a normal bridge. The first allows
the processor to first take over and mark some devices and private before
allowing the BIOS through the bridge.
