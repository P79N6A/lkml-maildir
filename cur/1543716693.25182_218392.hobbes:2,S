I don't see any essential interaction between these patches. This appears
to be 100% mergewerk. I don't think there's any essential conflict, just
potential PITA rediffing for the (re)senders if/when they touch the same
lines of code and things get accepted in a different order from what ppl
merged their stuff against. As far as I'm concerned, business as usual.
