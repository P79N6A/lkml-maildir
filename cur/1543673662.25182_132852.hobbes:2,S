Which the application thinks is still part of the file, and will expect its
changes to be written back.  Granted, if the page fault occurred just after
the truncate it'd get SIGBUS, so it's clearly not a robust assumption, but
it will result in unexpected behavior.  Note that if the application later
extends the file to include this page it could result in a corrupted file,
since all the pages around it will be written properly.
