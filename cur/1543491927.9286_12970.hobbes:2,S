No, we have already checked this: before shrink_mmap gets to the code
you refer to, we have already done a 
		/* We can't free pages unless there's just one user */

shrink_mmap() only deals with unshared, pure cache pages.  Shared pages
are handled correctly by mm/vmscan.c.

No, that is very much deliberate: there may well be other processes
around which still refer to the copy on disk, so we want to do a COW and
keep the swap cache copy present.  (This catches the case of a
partially-swapped-out process which keeps forking: if one child swaps a
page in, then we do a COW and the next child to access that page will
find its copy already in cache.)
Every swap cache page counts as a reference against the cached swap
entry.  delete_from_swap_cache performs a swap_free if necessary.

Probably!
