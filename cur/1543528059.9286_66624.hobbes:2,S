Again, *please* look back at the example in question.  Each operand of the
"or" operator is the result of a C comparison operator that returns either 0
or 1.  In this case it makes *no difference whatsoever* whether | or || is
used.  As I said, the compiler  should be able to recognize that the two are
equivalent and generate the fastest code (either using conditional
short-circuiting or not, as the case may be) regardless of which "or" operator
is used.
