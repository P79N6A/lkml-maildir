Thankyou for your consideration.

I agree, they're solving the same problem.  It is possible that the pain of 
change is no longer worthwhile, but I hate to see us give up on this.  We're 
adding complexity without making it harder to misuse.

I just converted virtio using latest Linus for fair comparison, and it's still 
pretty ugly.  sg_ring needs more work to de-scsi it.  sg_table is almost 
sg_ring except it retains all the chaining warts.
But we hit the same problems:
1) sg_chain loses information.  The clever chain packaging makes reading easy, 
but manipulation is severely limited.  You can append to your own chains by 
padding, but not someone elses.  This works for SCSI, but what about the rest 
of us?  And don't even think of joining mapped chains: it will almost work.
2) sg_chain's end marker is only for reading non-dma elements, not for mapped 
chains, nor for writing into chains.  Plus it's a duplicate of the num arg, 
which is still passed around for efficiency.  (virtio had to implement 
count_sg() because I didn't want those two redundant num args).
3) By overloading struct scatterlist, it's invisible what code has been 
converted to chains, and which hasn't.  Too clever by half!
Look at sg_chain(): it claims to join two scatterlists, but it doesn't.  It 
assumes that prv is an array, not a chain.  Because you've overloaded an 
existing type, this happens everywhere.  Try passing skb_to_sgvec a chained 
skb.
sg_ring would not have required any change to existing drivers, just those 
that want to use long sg lists.  And then it's damn obvious which are which.
4) sg_chain missed a chance to combine all the relevent information (max, num, 
num_dma and the sg array). sg_table comes close, but you still can't join 
them (no max information, and even if there were, what if it's full?).  
Unlike sg_ring, it's unlikely to reduce bugs.
5) (A little moot now) sg_ring didn't require arch changes.

Well it's just as possible, but you might have to copy more elements (with sg 
chaining you need only copy 1 sg element to make room for the chain elem).  
Agreed that it's a little out there...

We hide the real complexity from users and it makes it less safe for 
non-trivial cases.
Hence the introduction of YA datastructure: sg_table.  This is getting close: 
just hang the array off it and you'll have sg_ring and no requirement for 
dynamic alloc all the time.  And once you have a header, no need for chaining 
tricks...

I don't need that (I prepend and append), but it'd be nice if sg_next took a 
const struct scatterlist *.
