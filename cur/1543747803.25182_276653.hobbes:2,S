FYI, The vedic culture refers to vedic era.
The Vedic scriptures were written much before the books Mahabharatha and 
Ramayana.
The last of the vedas, ie, i don't know whether it is the Rig veda or the 
Yajur veda, talks about Kristu or Kristo somebody like that, referring to 
Jesus of Nazareth.
Maybe you should consult some Sanskrit scholars, before making wrong 
statements.
