Given an infinite number of monkeys yes. The 'disk I/O is not
interruptible' assumption is buried in vast amounts of software. This
isnt a case of sorting out a few misbehaving applications, you can start
with some of the most basic unix programs like 'ed' and work outwards.

locking if needed.

If I remember rightly stat() is not interruptible anyway. I don't
actually argue with the general claim. If I was redesigning unix right
now I would have no blocking calls, just 'start_xyz' and wait/notify.
However the unix api as defined has certain limitations and assumptions
we can pretty much never change. Open with O_INTR maybe would work ?
