Because init=/.sbi/init doesn't just start /.sbi/init as PID #1, it
starts an _internal kernel init_ which keeps on respawning the program
you pass to init= . That program doesn't have init-like properties
(can be killed, is not PID #1).

The kernel should be fixed. There should be a shell= option which does
what init= does now, and init= should just do what it implies ...
Mike.
