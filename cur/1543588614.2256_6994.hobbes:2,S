Actually, it had the dcache patch but I'm not aware of a patch from Al to
change icache behaviour.  In any case, changing the icache behaviour is
not what I'm getting at here - having the union of all private inode
structs in the generic inode is a huge waste of RAM.  Even for filesystems
that are heavy NFS users, they will likely still have a considerable amount
of local filesystem space (excluding NFS root systems, which are very few).
Al posted a patch to the NFS code which removes nfs_inode_info from the
inode union.  Since it is (AFAIK) the largest member of the union, we
have just saved 24 bytes per inode (hfs_inode_info is also rather large).
If we removed hfs_inode_info as well, we would save 108 bytes per inode,
about 22% ({ext2,affs,ufs}_inode_info are all about the same size).
No point in punishing all users for filesystems they don't necessarily use.
Even for people that DO use NFS and/or HFS, they are probably still wasting
10k inodes * 108 bytes = 1MB of RAM for no good reason (because most of
their inodes are probably not NFS and/or HFS).
Cheers, Andreas
