I had a consistent reproducer.  
I ruled out hangs in the tsc sync code itself,
  by implementing timeouts in all of the loops.
I looked for differences with the ia64 code.
I noticed that sometimes the machine would reboot
and not just hang.
I implemented smp_call_function_single since that was what the ia64
code did.  It worked and all of my pieces of evidence just fell
together.
