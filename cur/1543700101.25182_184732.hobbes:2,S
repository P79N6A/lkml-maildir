Hi,
Where can I find documentation on kernel boot options?
I have seen kernel boot options that look very similar to each other that 
I don't know if it is typo-error or just alternative form.
E.g.
apic
apicon
apic=on
noapic
acpi=off
acpi=force
acpismp=force
pci-noacpi
pci=noacpi
Thanks!
Regards,
Zhi Min
