Yeah!

Nice.

I'd be glad to do this work once your change makes it into the core.  Is
there any need for these drivers to export anything through sysfs now
instead of /proc?  From what I remember, it only looked like debugging
and other general info stuff.

So dev should point to the dev of the video class device?

You _have_ to set up a release function for your class device.  You
can't just kfree it like I think you are doing, otherwise any users of
the sysfs files will oops the kernel after the video class device is
gone.  I can point you to some examples of how to do this if you like.
Other than that, how about exporting the dev_t value for the video
device?  Then you automatically get udev support, and I don't have to go
add it to this code later :)
thanks,
