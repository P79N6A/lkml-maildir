No, that's a very different issue: you are violating the NFS cache
consistency rules if you are changing a file that is being held open by
other machines.
The correct way to do the above is to use GNU install with the '-b'
option: that will rename the version of glibc that is in use, and then
install the new glibc in a different inode.
Cheers,
