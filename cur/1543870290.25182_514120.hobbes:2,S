i dont see the advantage of arg_nr - if the arguments are direct then 
the best way is to just fetch them all, not to do testing upon arg_nr. 
Furthermore, regarding the indirect pointers, they are quite essential 
for some uses, see:

yes. But a 'flags' field is handy anyway, to signal things like 
NOCOMPLETE or SYSLET_SYNC/SYSLET_ASYNC (a flags field is always useful 
in such structures). So the condition testing comes 'for free' in 
essence.
but ... as you can see it with sys_umem_add(), i like the addition of 
helper syscalls - i just think that this particular one wouldnt be too 
helpful.

the problem is signals: a syslet has to return to user-space upon 
signals or upon a stop condition. So to notify about the precise place 
of stoppage, the notification ring is a 'built in' property.
(nevertheless, as i mentioned it in a prior mail, i'll create separate 
ring syscalls, because they are useful for other stuff too.)

i dont see a huge conceptual difference between having the syslet helper 
in flags versus having it in a separate syscall. Other than yours has 
twice the number of atoms.

try to do this in FIO. You'd have to create many extra atoms to push the 
fd into the argument fields - instead of just sharing the variable. 
Sharing is /good/. These 'simplifications' complicate the whole syslet 
programming model down to being near unusable.

take a look at FIO.
