Yes, the shape of the tree just limits where to reclaim from

Yes, potentially. With soft limit, the general expectation is this
Let us say you have group A and B
        groupA, soft limit = 1G
        groupB, soft limit = 2G
Now assume the system has 4G. When groupB is not using its memory,
group A can grab all 4G, but when groupB kicks in and tries to use 2G
or more, then the expectation is that
group A will get 1/3 * 4 = 4/3G
group B will get 2/3 * 4 = 8/3G
Similar to CPU shares currently.

With tree reclaim, reclaim will first reclaim from A and stop if
successful, otherwise it will go to 01, 02 and 03 and then go back to
A.
>    2) when group_A/01 hit limits.
This will reclaim only from 01, since A is under its limit
>    3) when group_A/02 hit limits.
This will reclaim only from 02 since A is under its limit
Does RR do the same right now?

I agree that fine tuning it will require time, but what we need is
something usable that will not have hard to debug or understand corner cases.

We should talk to Paul and convince him.

cgroup has hierarchy management already, in the form of children and
sibling. Walking those structures is up to us, that is all we do
currently :)
