This patch looks good to me.  I added the following as a header.
Is this ok?  The "Signed-off-by" line is pretty important in patches.

This patch adds the ability to register for a command per-channel in
the IPMI driver.
If your BMC supports multiple channels, incoming messages can be
differentiated by the channel on which they arrived. In this case it's
useful to have the ability to register to receive commands on a
specific channel instead the current behaviour of all channels.
