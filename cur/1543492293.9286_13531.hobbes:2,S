i haven't tried all of arca8 yet, but i did sniff around in the bdflush
logic to see what you tried out.  i took a stock 2.2.5 kernel and took out
the "run_task_queue()" in wakeup_bdflush() just to see what that it would
do. that made things a little worse, so i'm guessing you also had some
compensatory changes in other areas.
i'm interested to see how your flushtime changes will effect performance.

i'm discovering that a 13 bit hash mitigates the spikey size distribution
in the page hash *better* than the +offset change.  although i've been
able to push the system into swap, i still haven't seen any degenerate
hash behavior that's as bad as the buffer cache's hash function.
i'll have more as i test this further.

i suspected that the strange performance behavior wasn't an implementation
problem, so i tried a plain 2.2.5 kernel with just the page struct
alignment mod in your latest patch.  the numbers were about the same as
before. it would probably be a good idea if someone could actually take a
close look at what the alignment mod is doing to change hardware behavior,
'cause it's obviously not what we expect.
