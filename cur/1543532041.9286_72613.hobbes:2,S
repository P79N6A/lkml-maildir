Fixed for me. Since yenta doesn't probe irq12, it doesn't cause me any
lockups
> ACPI/APM suspend issue
Does this have anything to do with suspend/resume on any cardbus cards? 
3c575_cb doesn't suspend very well.
Also, when using 2.3.99pre3 (change was in pre3-3 I believe), pcmcia's
cardmgr sees my 3com card as 3c575_cb instead of eth0 (try ifconfiging
3c575_cb sometime <g>)  I'm not sure about other cardbus cards as I only
have 1.
