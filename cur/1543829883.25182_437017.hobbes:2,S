The change is that ARCH_PFN_OFFSET has a slightly different meaning when 
you alter those two initialisation functions. Currently it is used to 
offset memmap from NODE_DATA(0)->node_start_pfn. By changing 
free_area_init() and init_bootmem(), it changes to altering the value of 
NODE_DATA(0)->node_start_pfn but only when memory is initialised in a 
particular way. I believe it makes ARCH_PFN_OFFSET even more obscure than 
it currently is.
I think we should just fix the problem at hand now for which two simple 
patches have been posted and consider making further changes to 
free_area_init() and init_bootmem() as a separate issue.

IA64 do not and I didn't check all arches.
