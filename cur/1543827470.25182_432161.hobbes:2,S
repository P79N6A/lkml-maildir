I think it should be, yes.

If you can read the line state, then yes... I would detect which of
the above four states you're in, and generate a STOP condition for
a, b, and c:
a) setscl(1), setsda(1)
b) setsda(0), setscl(1), setsda(1)
c) setsda(1)
If you can't read the line state... well, that's not actually a proper
I2C bus anyway.  At that point I suggest 'whatever works'.
But even if you need to generate a 'null transfer' (prohibited by spec)
to get reliable operation... that doesn't belong in the algorithm driver.
