Indeed..
In contrast to APC and Andre's struggle with them, if you go to
Best's website you can download their UPS software. The Unix version
is available as source.
So let's see:
APC: made it difficult for Andre to write his programme and release
the source. (and it's not like Andre got loads of spec's and help
from them AFAIK).
Best: wrote their own upsd, and have the source openly available on
their website.
which one do you trust/respect the most?
