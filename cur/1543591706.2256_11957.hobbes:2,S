I said I don't care about bugreport of alpha kernel crashes if the
_alpha_ kernel was compiled with gcc 2.95.*. 2.95 is fine on the x86,
but it's broken on the alpha. In short:
	x86 2.4 kernels		->	use 2.95.[34] or egcs 1.1.2 (I
					use 2.95.4 from the
					gcc_2_95_branch of CVS)
	alpha 2.4 kernel	->	use egcs 1.1.2 or 2.96 with some
					houndred of patches (I
					personally still use the egcs
					1.1.2)

Please try to reproduce with egcs 1.1.2 to be sure.

x86 and alpha are completly different issues with regard to the
compiler. I never heard of problems with 2.95.4 on x86 and I would never
replace 2.95.4 from the gcc_2_95_branch for the latest 2.96 on my x86
boxes, I'd instead try again gcc 3.0 after the inline asm fixes for "+="
constranints on local variables are done.
