looking at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.9-rc4/2.6.9-rc4-mm1/broken-out/i2o-new-functions-to-convert-messages-to-a-virtual-address.patch,
it seems the include/linux/i2o.h patch is missing:
tell me if I'm wrong, but i think this patch is missing:
[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
at least it resolves the unknown symbol i2o_msg_in_to_virt issues for
me ;-)
