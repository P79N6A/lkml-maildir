And leave unfixed all the regressions introduced in earlier kernel versions 
and known at the time of the release of that version but still present in 
the current version? Not to mention all the other bugs reported by users of 
recent stable versions?

That can be true for not-so-recently introduced bugs too.
There are so many bugs out there and developers tend to focus on new ones 
leaving a lot of others unattended, both important and not so important 
ones.
Which ones should someone focus on? Maybe on the ones that someone (helped) 
introduce him/herself. Maybe that should even sometimes be prioritized over 
introducing new bugs^W^W^Wdoing new development.
