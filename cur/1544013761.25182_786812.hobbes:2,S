Yup.
In my setup I did not see the warnings.
Most likely because I'm sitting on an older i386 and the
64 bit version of gcc emits more warnings than my 32 bit version.
The build broke in with Dave's native gcc and will most likely with
a 64 bit cross compiler too.
I do not want to remove the -Werror just due to this as it
is only a limited effort to fix up the patches when I get
my setup fixed.
But due to other issues (you know work and such) it it not the next week
that I have a proper setup.
