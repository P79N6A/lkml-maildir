The patch which went in six months or so back which said "only reclaim slab
if we're scanning lowmem pagecache" was wrong.  I must have been asleep at
the time.
We do need to scan slab in response to highmem page reclaim as well. 
Because all the math is based around the total amount of memory in the
machine, and we know that if we're performing highmem page reclaim then the
lower zones have no free memory.
Also, the fact that this patch makes such a difference on the 1.5G machine
points at a problem in balancing the reclaim rate against the different
zones.  I'll take a look at that separate problem.
This should apply to 2.6.3-mm2.
