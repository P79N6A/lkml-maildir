Hi all.
My DEC 21140 network card is telling me the following (with tulip module
loaded):
fox:/root# ifconfig eth0
eth0     Link encap: Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:E8:24:7A:38
           inet addr:1.5.112.0  Bcast:1.255.255.255  Mask:255.0.0.0
           UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
           RX packets:2175 erros:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:1
           TX packets:0 errors:18745 dropped:144 overruns:0 carrier:0
coll:0
           Interrupt:10 Base address:0xf480
fox:/root# uptime
 13:43pm  up 13 min, 1 user, load average:0.00, 0.02, 0.02
fox:/root# lsmod
Module      Size  Used by
tulip       25076   1
fox:/root# _
I can ping, telnet, browse the web, etc.
Is there something i forget to do or something i need to do? I've enabled
the full-duplex of the card.
The configuration is basically the same as 2.0.36 (and work in this).
Thanks in advance.
