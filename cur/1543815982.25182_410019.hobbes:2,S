IMO it makes completely sense to move the time/timer/clocks related
generic code into kernel/time.
drivers/clocksource holds drivers which can be shared between
architectures.
The other drivers really should stay in the architecture specific files
as they are often deeply embedded in the SoC or chipset support code.
