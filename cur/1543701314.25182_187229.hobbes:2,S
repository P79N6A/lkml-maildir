I agree on one side, there's the drawback on a size increase (3 pointers, 
plus eventually a spinlock) of the task struct. But IMO the code would be 
cleaner, since you know who is the target of the message. Also it would 
not require any cleanup since there would be nothing allocated, just a 
struct member inside task_struct.
Also, what happens in the task woke up by a send does not reschedule 
before another CPU does another send? Wouldn't a message be lost?
