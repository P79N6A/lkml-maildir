I can't see why this should be restricted to embedded systems?

You achieve the same just by selecting only one scheduler.  PLUGSCHED 
(currently) doesn't directly control the inclusion of any code and it's 
only effect is by controlling which schedulers are included.  It may be 
possible to change this so that the checking of the boot time scheduler 
selection code is excluded.

I'll check. I'll also see how much difference the boot time selection 
code adds but I doubt whether it's very much.

Each scheduler costs about 10kB on average.  Mine are the largest :-( 
(too many features including making extra stats available via /proc?) 
and I should look at improving that.
