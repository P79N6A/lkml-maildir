Yes, it is a feature. The behaviour of the Linux driver was changed in
2.4 to match the behaviour of other Unix tape drivers in this case.
It is legal to read blocks that are smaller than the byte count and so
the non-matching block size is not an error as such. It is an error only if
the block is larger than the requested size and this error is returned to
the user. I admit that the code ENOMEM is not too informative but there is
not an error code for too big block size.

It seems that the st man page only documents the 2.2 behaviour (my fault).
I have not seen a good tutorial for tape operations in Unix. The man pages
document some things. The basic rule is that you must know the block
size(s) on the tape and set the parameters accordingly.
