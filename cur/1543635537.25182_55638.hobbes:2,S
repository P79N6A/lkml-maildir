Is it worth adding MUST_NOT_HOLD(&lock) in an attempt to catch potential
deadlocks?
Say that if two or more of locks A, B and C are to be taken, then
they must be taken in that order. You might then have code like:
	MUST_NOT_HOLD(&lock_B) ;
	MUST_NOT_HOLD(&lock_C) ;
	spinlock(&lock_A) ;
I think you need a separate asertion for this !MUST_NOT_HOLD(&lock)
has different semantics.
