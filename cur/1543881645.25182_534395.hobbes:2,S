the raw linecount appears to be the following:
 suspend2-2.2.9.12-for-2.6.21-rc6.patch
   89 files changed, 16452 insertions(+), 69 deletions(-)
 $ suspend-0.5> countlines
 32260
so, while it's probably apples to oranges, uswsusp seems to be larger, 
while there's at least one feature that it is missing.
also, from the structure of the suspend2 patch it seemed to me that they 
could peacefully coexist in the kernel without stepping on each other's 
toes - why not do that? Users will then pick the winner.
