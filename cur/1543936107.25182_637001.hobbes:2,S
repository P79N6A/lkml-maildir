That is what I was thinking. Is it really necessary to support  
something like bsg for 32 on 64 bit? Yes, it is a userspace interface,  
but it isn't the kind of thing that normal user programs would use. It  
is a new interface for newly-written programs and I would expect those  
to be native. At least it doesn't strike me as overly-restrictive for  
that to be the case for this kind of interface.

Precisely.
