In fact we don't need to do this.
The solution is not to touch ACPI in the boot kernel (ie. the one that loads
the image) and pass control to the image kernel.  This is how it's supposed
to work according to the spec, more or less (well, there are some ugly details
that need handling, like the restoration of the NVS area).

Rather the ACPI state data that the platform firmware stores may be different,
depending on whether you enter S4 or S5 during "power off" and that determines
the interactions between the kernel and the firmware after the next boot.
