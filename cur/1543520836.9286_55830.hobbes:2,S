this problem doesn't only show up for Y2K but before _any_ lap year!
and here is a fix for this off-by-one bug:
@@ -66,10 +67,10 @@
        year = day / 365;               /* non-leap years since epoch */
        printf("[d=%d y=%d] ", day, year);
        /* correct for leap years in epoch: 1972 (2) was the first */
-       if ((year + 2) / 4 + 365 * year > day)
+       if ((year + 1) / 4 + 365 * year > day)
                year--;
        /* reduce to day in current year */
-       day -= (year + 2) / 4 + 365 * year;
+       day -= (year + 1) / 4 + 365 * year;
        printf("[d=%d y=%d] ", day, year);
        /* map March, 1st to Feburary, 29nd for leap years */
        if (day == 59 && ((year + 2) & 3) == 0) {
the code in 2.2.x kernel sources (fat_date_unix2dos() in fs/fat/misc.c)
looks ok though:
        year = day/365;
        if ((year+3)/4+365*year > day) year--;
        day -= (year+3)/4+365*year;
because here `year' is based on 1980 (epoch for MSDOS) and not 1970,
which gives that offset of 2 (== 10 % 4).
