The option for turning off memory overcommit in the kernel does not
completely disable it -- it merely makes the kernel somewhat more
conservative.  Truely disabling memory overcommit would require counting
commitments every time a fork() or private mmap()ing occurs.  2.0 is flaky
under these cases too.

Try creating a swap file.  Running without swap is *not* recommended
(more so for 2.2 than 2.0).
