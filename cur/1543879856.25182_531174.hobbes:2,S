just to make sure: this is a short (and incomplete) list of contributors 
related to scheduler interactivity code. The full list of contributors 
to sched.c includes many other people as well: Peter, Suresh, Christoph, 
Kenneth and many others. Even the git logs, which only span 2 years out 
of 15, already list 79 individual contributors to kernel/sched.c.
