Subject: [PATCH 11/14] x86_64 irq: Remove unnecessary irq 0 setup.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/23/86

The code in io_apic.c and in i8259.c currently hardcode the same
vector for the timer interrupt so there is no reason for a special
assignment for the timer as the setup for the i8259 already takes care
of this.
