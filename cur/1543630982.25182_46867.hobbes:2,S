Hi Jesse,

this is actually similar usage to my example:

the user in my example above would be wwwrun or httpd - and that does not
make any sense at all! It would make much more sense if the new files
belonged to the owner of the directory, who is the one who owns the
virtual host.

Not in my example - acutally even the other way around.

Again: it depends on the usage. In my case it is the other way around. A
use should know what he is doing if he is setting this flag on a
directory.  And making such files suid again, has to be prevented by the
code - that I even mentioned in my first mail on this issue.

I only said, it works under FreeBSD, it is an option there.
