Good news. Congrats.

Since your floppy doesn't contain a valid bootsector, it won't start
from floppy here. At least my mkdosfs created boot sector says:
This is not a bootable disk.  Please insert a bootable floppy and
press any key to try again ...
The simplest solution is choosing win(9*|me) from boot manager then, press
F8 immediately, select boot to command prompt. (Hope this works in me, too) 
Issue
c:\> sys a:
and
c:\> edit msdos.sys
then, as above. If booting from floppy still fails, check BIOS boot order.
Note: if you don't trust your winloose inst., check the created bootsector:
1) Label at offset 3 should read MSWIN4.1 or the like
2) some readable error messages at around 0x180 
3) IO      SYSMSDOS  SYS at ~0x1d8
BTW[FAR OT]: Somebody remember IHC here?
