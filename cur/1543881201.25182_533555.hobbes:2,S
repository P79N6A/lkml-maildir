I'm pretty confident in this patch for 2.6.21, but I wouldn't object to
waiting until 2.6.22-rc1 either. Operationally, the change isn't that
big and makes the locking more clear and the code simpler. I've tested
on populated file systems, virgin file systems, and tested the error
handling path with each. There is still a bug lurking in how a failure
in ACL inheritance is cleaned up that I ran into while testing, but this
patch didn't introduce it or exacerbate it. I'll add that to my xattr
patch queue.
