Replication does not work that way.  On each replication cycle, the
differences between the most recent two volume snapshots go over the
network.  This strategy has the nice effect of consolidating rewrites.
There are also excellent delta compression opportunities.
In the worst case, with insufficient bandwidth for the churn rate of
the volume, replication rate increases to the time for replicating the
full volume.  Again, at worst, this would require extra storage for the
snapshot to be replicated equivalent to the original volume size, so
that the primary volume is not forced to wait synchronously for a
replication cycle to complete.
Mirroring on the other hand, makes a realtime copy of a volume, that is
never out of date.
I hope this helps.

Frantic... your word.  Designing for dependably high transaction rates
requires a different mode of thinking that some traditionalists seem to
be having some trouble with.
