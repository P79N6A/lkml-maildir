Which kind is that?  The VT6202 is buggy as all get-out, and
they sold a *LOT* of those discrete chips for use in add-on PCI
cards.  We generally warn people away from those.  A more current
version is the VT6212, which was much more usable.  (If it says
EHCI 0.95, it's a VT6202... their EHCI 1.0 chips were much better.)

Yes ... although if you don't need to blacklist their EHCI 1.0 chips
don't do it.  (Any VIA EHCI integrated into a southbridge is going
to follow spec rev 1.0 pretty well, modulo idiosyncratic timings.)

Another case where there are a lot of add-on "EHCI 0.95" cards; but
in this case the quirks were less significant.
