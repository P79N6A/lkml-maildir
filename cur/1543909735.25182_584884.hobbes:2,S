Kyle, What I'm suggesting is scrapping all existing
concepts and replacing them with something entirely
new. Posix, Unix, SELinux go away except for an
emulation layer for backwards compatibility. What I'm
suggesting is to start over and do it right. 
If this new idea is implemented then one could
implement POSIX as one of many permission modules that
one could load. One could also load a WINDOWS
permission model that could be used with SAMBA. This
would be a new more powerful underlying layer that can
be used to emulate anything you want. And it would be
great for people using FUSE who could make file
systems look any way they want.
One of the problems with the Unix/Linux world is that
your minds are locked into this one model. In order to
do it right it requires the mental discipline to break
out of that.
