Uh?  How it comes?  VMware modules work in any kernel configuration and 
architecture.  With exception of vmmon, which contains inline assembly 
for i386 & x86-64 only.  But all configs are supported.

This is just nonsense.  I am not talking about using new API, I'm saying 
that API which was not GPL-only without lockdep has GPL-only portion 
with lockdep, and this GPL-only portion is needed by implementation of 
code which existed before lockdep.  To me this looks like unexpected 
change of kernel API, and as such should be documented and warned about.

I have no idea how NVidia managed to work around that problem, but 
VMware modules suddenly depend on this GPL-only symbol, although nothing 
in the module sources refers to lockdep (same sources which worked 
yesterday are being used).
