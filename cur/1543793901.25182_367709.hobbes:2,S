But block-backed filesytems have the same concern: we don't want to do a
whole bunch of 4k I/Os.  Hence the writepages() interface, which is the
appropriate place to be building up these large I/Os.
NFS does nfw_writepages->mpage_writepages->nfs_writepage and to build the
large I/Os it leaves the I/O pending on return from nfs_writepage().  It
appears to flush any pending pages on the exit path from nfs_writepages().
If that's a correct reading then there doesn't appear to be any way in
which there's dangling I/O left to do after nfs_writepages() completes.
If there _is_ dandling I/O left over then that's problematic, and probably
doesn't buy us much in the way of performance benefit.
