Please try to make the patch titles big-endian.  This one could have been
char: rocket.c: fix sparse variable shadowing and int as NULL pointer
or even
rocket.c: fix sparse variable shadowing and int as NULL pointer

That's really a sparse glitch.  There's nothing we can sanely do about it.

Apart from things like that.
Probably this code is cleaner than the old version so let's do it, but it
seems that we need a general fix.
