2.4.0-test12 compiled on an IBM ThinkPad 600 51U (Pentium II)
with PCMCIA support.  Same behavior with Linus PCMCIA and 
Hinds PCMCIA.  I have a Xircom modem/ethernet card which
works correctly using the serial_cs, xirc2ps_cs, ds, i82365 
and pcmcia_core modules; however when I try to "cardctl eject"
or "reboot" I get first,
"KERNEL: assertion(dev->ip_ptr==NULL)failed at
dev.c(2422):netdev_finish_unregister"
(not exact since I had to copy it down on paper ... doesn't
show up in the logs) then a perpetual series of:
"unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. Usage count =
-1"
messages every five seconds or so.  "ps -A" reveals that
modprobe is running; it can't be killed even with "kill -9".
The "ifconfig" command locks up.
