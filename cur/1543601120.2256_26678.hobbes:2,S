Hi, Martin,
I hope, this sounds not to stupid:
As an hardware test I have run quake3d_demo with enabled DRI. 
For this, I have compiled the 2.4.9 kernel the older DRM-code in, so I
could use the installed Xfree86 4.03 instead the required 4.1:
No error, no lockup, even though this game produced heavy load on ram and
harddisks.
No lockup too with the small traffic on the NIC,  for instance with the
ADSL-connection (max. 90 kb/s) to our router.
But, as I sayd, repeatable lockups with some higher network-traffic inside
the LAN.
regards
                          Matthias
