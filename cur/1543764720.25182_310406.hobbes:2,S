that's a 42.4% compressed size. Using a (much) more CPU-intense 
compression method (bzip -9), the compressed size is down to 45 MBytes.  
(a ratio of 20.2%)
using default 'gzip' i get 57 MB compressed.

with bzip2 -9 it would be 551 MBytes. It might as well be practical on 
faster CPUs, a full tree (224 MBytes, 45 MBytes compressed) decompresses 
in 24 seconds on a 3.4GHz P4 - single CPU. (and with dual core likely 
becoming the standard, we might as well divide that by two) With default 
gzip it's 3.3 seconds though, and that still compresses it down to 57 
MB.
