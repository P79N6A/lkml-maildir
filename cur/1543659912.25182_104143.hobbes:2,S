That's interesting. It doesn't happen for me, but I'm using older 
binutils. The patch really only changes two things (except for ARM):
o whitespace
o It adds AT(ADDR(section) - 0)
Both of these should be NOPs, but apparently not. Could you try removing
the AT(...) from include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h?
Also, what does
	objdump -h vmlinux
and
	grep __start_ System.map
say?
