Doesn't work, as long as we have throttle_vm_writeout() waiting for
NR_WRITEBACK to go below a threshold, delaying the NR_WRITEBACK
accounting could lead to a deadlock.
So at least until that's resolved NR_WRITEBACK_TEMP needs to be
separate from NR_WRITEBACK_TEMP.  And it makes sense possibly even
after that, as they are fundamentally different things.  The first one
is page cache pages being under writeout, the second is just kernel
buffers (mostly) unrelated to the page cache.

Yes, that's a possibility, but then normal filesystems miss out on the
small optimization provided by doing the BDI accounting functions
inside the same IRQ disabled region as the radix tree operation.
Would that have any significant performance impact?
