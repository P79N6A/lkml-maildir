Hi, Ingo!
>>Could you run the

I'll do that! But a little bit later - I have tested that on my home computer.
>>hm, is there no other workload on the system?
Workload: firefox, transmission(torrent client), gnome terminal, music player.
Now I think it could be not a scheduler issue but network subsystem
... but I've got such situation on previous kernels and w/o torrent
client running.
The problem is not in switching tabs in firefox but in _opening_new_url_.
I'm not good in Con's patches but are they touching network subsystem?
