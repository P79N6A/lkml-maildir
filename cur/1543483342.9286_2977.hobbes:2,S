I had a similar problem when I upgraded from 2.0.36 to 2.2.0pre9.  As it
turns out, the routing and interface stuff has changed somewhat, so your
network configure scripts need some tweaking.  This worked for me:
ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 up
Also make sure you have the right net-tools. (1.49 or later I think).
