Hi Linus,
  maybe there is a little misunderstaniding. I thought that acquire_pci_dev
should do (sorry for exact names of locking functions):
  lock_wrlock(&ioresource_lock)
  failed = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
     pci->resource_allocated[i] = NULL;
     if (pci->resource[i].end) {
        if (pci->resource[i].flags & IORESOURCE_IOPORT)
          pci->resource_allocated[i] = __request_region(&ioport_resource, pci->resource[i].start,
              pci->resource[i].end-pci->resource[i].start+1);
        else
          pci->resource_allocated[i] = __request_region ....
        if (!pci->resource_allocated[i]) {
          failed = 1;
          break;
        }
     }
  }
  if (failed) { for ( ; i >= 0; i--) {
     if (pci->resource_allocated[i]) release_resource(dummy[i]);
     pci->resource_allocated[i] = NULL;
  } }
  lock_unlock(&ioresource_lock);
  return failed ? -ENXIO : 0;
  It is common case that you need allocate whole device, preferrably
as atomic operation.
                                                        Petr Vandrovec

P.S.: And if we are talking about PIIX4 IDE - should not we add its ioports
into resource[] during pci fixups? Other (promise) do have these resources
listed in config space (I see no reason why we must have mapping resource <->
pci base_address region 1:1, if drivers know about it)
