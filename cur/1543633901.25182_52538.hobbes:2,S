Mandrake is using devfs. And the security and stability issues have
been fixed many months ago. The "devfs races" that Al used to complain
about regularly have been fixed. I haven't heard from Al for many
months (I see that as a positive sign:-). The current devfs code is in
maintenance mode. The next release of code will be a new devfs core
which uses the VFS for tree maintenance, making the code much smaller.
I.e. not a bugfixing release.
If there *are* remaining bugs with the devfs core (or devfsd for that
matter), I've not been made aware of them. If you know something I
don't, please let me know. AFAICT, all the bugs are long since solved.
