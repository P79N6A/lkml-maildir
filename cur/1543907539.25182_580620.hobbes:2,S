Subject: [RFC][PATCH 1/5] pagemap: remove file header
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/7/497

The /proc/<pid>/pagemap file has a header containing:
 * first byte:   0 for big endian, 1 for little
 * second byte:  page shift (eg 12 for 4096 byte pages)
 * third byte:   entry size in bytes (currently either 4 or 8)
 * fourth byte:  header size
The endianness is only useful when examining a raw dump of
pagemap from a different machine when you don't know the
source of the file.  This is pretty rare, and the programs
or scripts doing the copying off-machine can certainly be
made to hold this information.
The page size is available in userspace at least with libc's
getpagesize().  This will also never vary across processes,
so putting it in a per-process file doesn't make any difference.
If we need a "kernel's page size" exported to userspace,
perhaps we can put it in /proc/meminfo.
The entry size is the really tricky one.  This can't just
be sizeof(unsigned long) from userspace because we can have
32-bit processes on 64-bit kernels.  But, userspace can
certainly derive this value if it lseek()s to the end of
the file, and divides the file position by the size of its
virtual address space.
In any case, I believe this information is redundant, and
can be removed.
