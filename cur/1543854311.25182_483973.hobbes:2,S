I believe that this could run afoul of the example I sent out earlier
(based on Alan's example).  In my mind, the key difference between
this and Jens's suggestion is that in Jens's case, we check for -all-
the counters being zero, not just the old ones.  (But I still don't
trust Jen's optimization -- I just have not yet come up with an example
showing breakage, possibly because there isn't one, but...)
						Thanx, Paul
