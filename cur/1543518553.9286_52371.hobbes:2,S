Which breaks source compatibility as well. If you have something like:
struct vmoperations_struct btp_vm_ops = {
    bt_vmopen, bt_vmclose, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, bt_vmnopage, NULL, NULL,
NULL };
Change the order of elements so that the nopage operator is the third
element rather than the 7th element and the source breaks. Hopefully you had
complete prototypes and the types were different in some way so that the
compiler can detect the problem.
In any case, you broke both the source and binary.

I think you mean remove it in the next development release. If it was in 2.2
and is obsolete, you want to remove it in 2.3. It is always the odd releases
of Linux that are supposed to break things.
