I got an e-mailed developer's newsletter from SGI two days ago, and it
contained the following blurb:

SGI and VERITAS Work Together to Provide a Converged File System
Solution for the Linux Operating System*
Recognizing the need to enhance the robust, enterprise features of
Linux(tm),
 SGI and VERITAS Software Corporation, the two leaders in file system
technology,
announced they are working together to provide a converged file system
solution
for the Linux operating system.
The rapid acceptance of the Linux operating system has invited the
contribution
of key innovations by market leaders to allow Linux to be adopted by
demanding
enterprise customers. VERITAS software will bring its wealth of information
availability
solutions to the Linux user community, while SGI will strengthen Linux
through performance
and resilience enhancements to the file system, resulting in Linux becoming
more widely
accepted. VERITAS Software Corporation designs, markets, and services
enterprise
storage management and high availability software products for
business-critical computing
systems. SGI is a market leader in technical computing, offering the world's
most powerful
servers, supercomputers and visual workstations.

I asked someone from SGI about this, and the response I got was that my
correspondent
could not comment on this issue, and that it was the responsibility of
marketing.
I then found that the SGI site has a news release at
http://www.sgi.com/newsroom/press_releases/1999/may/veritas.html
that talks about SGI and Veritas forming a "strike team to investigate
development of journaled
file system solution for linux", but again it doesn't mention XFS.  Is this
just the XFS project,
or is something else afoot?
