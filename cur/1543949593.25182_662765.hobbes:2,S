Thank you for the comment.
I'm thinking about an idea come from Mike and Jens after the session
at LSF'08:
  o stacking driver clones both bio and request and uses
    bio->bi_end_io and rq->end_io
  o stacking driver uses blk_complete_request() in rq->end_io
    so that stacking driver can work without queue lock
With this idea, we don't need to add the new hook to request,
and we can use request stacking on drivers using __blk_end_request().
Currently, I'm trying to convert request-based dm to use the idea above.
I'll post the new version as a RFC in the near future.
Thanks,
