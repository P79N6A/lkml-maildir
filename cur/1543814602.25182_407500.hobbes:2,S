Hi,
i need to create a new module for my training, but i wonder if the
classic C instructions (like printf, scanf, puts and more) are
availables when i do my module.
I don't think so, but i can be mistaken.
If it's not, where i can find a good list of the instruction i can use.
Thanks for your help.
bye
