Linux is only reporting the information contained within the BIOS. It's not
going to cause you a problem. Other than printing it, the only thing Linux
uses the information for is to ensure that we don't lock up the machine by
trying to use certain APM functinos on certain laptops which have
known-buggy BIOSes. (You can blame Dell for this particular piece of 
incompetence).
