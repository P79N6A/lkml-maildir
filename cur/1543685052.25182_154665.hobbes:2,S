Today I found 2 APIC errors in my system log:
  Aug  5 10:45:27 helios kernel: APIC error on CPU0: 00(02)
  Aug  5 10:45:27 helios kernel: APIC error on CPU1: 00(02)
Perhaps this is just coincidence but I had just closed an application that 
uses the serial port.  The serial driver is integral to the kernel, not 
built as a module.  
A snippet of log file, showing the context of the errors, is shown below.  
It documents my shutting down HylaFAX, the errors occurring, and 
restarting HylaFAX.  The APIC errors occurred 38 seconds after closing the 
serial port.
My environment:
  Red Hat Linux v7.3 + all RH updates + plain-vanilla kernel v2.4.21
  Dual Pentium3/850MHz on a Giga-Byte GA-6BXDU motherboard 
The Linux Kernel FAQ (at 
http://www.tux.org/lkml/#s13-4
) says not to worry 
about only a few such errors.  OK, I won't.  I am noting this behavior in 
case anyone is interested.
Thanks.
