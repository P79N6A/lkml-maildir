This more friendly wording makes me feel actually happy to get from my
hiding place and tell that I actually saw the percpu counters code, just
after I made Eric's code generic as I thought it should have been from
the start, I found out about what was already in lib/.
I just got lazy to do what at the time looked the right thing
to do: to read thru the existing lib/ code and use it where pcounter was
being used. But at least it got exposed 8-)
Anyway, progress was made, I do not feel too bad about it even now.
