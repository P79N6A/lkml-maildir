Another interesting thing about assuming low pids better: Anyone can
get a low pid. Just fork/exit/fork/exit... until you have one. Couldn't
someone come up with a relativly easy DoS attack by gaining a lower PID
than some important program (especially since the importants are in the
300-1000 range), and then blowing all memory on the box (even if
slowly)?
Memory priorities would not allow that.
