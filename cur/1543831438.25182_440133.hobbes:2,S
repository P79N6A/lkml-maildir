I explained my reasoning to him --- that inode.i_cindex isn't
initialized until after the VFS-specific char-open is called, so you
can never depend on index.i_cindex being valid except in char device
driver's open method --- and that function gets passed a file pointer
as well as an index pointer.  So the clean up that Al wants to do can
just as easily be done by having the device drivers use file->f_cindex
instead of inode->i_cindex.
