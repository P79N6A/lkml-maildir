Subject: [2.3.15-2] pppd 2.3.9 not redialing with 'demand'?

	Hi, I have pppd working with 2.3.15 on a UP PPro.  The 'demand' option
seems to work, because pppd successfully detects internet activity and
dials.  However, after it disconnects (due to inactivity) it will not
redial.
	The inability to redial seems to be becuase pppd simply doesn't notice
any activity on the link.  It doesn't respond on any way after it first
disconnects, even if debug and kdebug are turned on.  Here are my
options: I've twiddled everything, and still pppd work fine but notices
no packets after it hangs up the modem.
	THanks for any help,
