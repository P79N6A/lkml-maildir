I guess one could use the slab allocators as a type of reservation 
ticket generator with zero sized objects. Hmmm.... But is that really a 
useful thing to do?

That would have to occur with objects that are repeatedly allocated and 
then linked toghether etc. Linking typicallty requires a listhead so its 
typically difficult to do zero length objects.

The cases that we have seen so far are due to array allocations of N 
elements where N == 0 leads to the creation of a zero sized object.
The objects of the array are not zero sized it is just that zero of 
them are allocated.
