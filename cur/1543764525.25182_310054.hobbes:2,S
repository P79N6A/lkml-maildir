After applying a patch, I can do a complete "show-diff" on the kernel tree
to see the effect of it in about 0.15 seconds.
Also, I can use rsync to efficiently replicate my database without having 
to re-send the whole crap - it only needs to send the new stuff.
You do that with an sql database, and I'll be impressed.
