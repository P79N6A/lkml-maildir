We did it for a product using PowerPC on compactPCI.  Critical logs are stored
in ram beyond what the kernel uses, and it can be mapped in for processes to use
it.
As long as the card has power, the information remains available, including
resets of the card.
The only tricky bit is that I don't know if a warm boot on a PC wipes ram or
not...
