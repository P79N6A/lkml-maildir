This is a pretty small change and is not necessary for every driver.
What do you still desire that this patch set doesn't provide?

If in #1 pci_enable_device() assigns I/O Port resources even though
the driver doesn't need it, PCI devices which _only_ support I/O Port
space will get screwed (depending on config). We are trying to avoid that.
Or do you have another way of avoiding unused resource allocation?
