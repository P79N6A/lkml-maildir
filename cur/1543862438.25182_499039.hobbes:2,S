I suspect I have misunderstood your idea. Correct me if this is wrong:
if you add:
F:	drivers/pci
Then also the directories hotplug and pcie (and its content) will fall 
to that entry, unless there is someone adding:
F:	drivers/pci/hotplug
in their entry.
With the approach I suggested that is not possible (unless introducing 
wildcards).
Also, a maintainer for the "hotplug" have to add:
F:	drivers/pci/hotplug
F:	drivers/pci/setup-bus
or
C:	HOTPLUG
and what will hinder it from including drivers/pci/hotplug/ other then 
adding the F: on PCI Hotplugs maintainer? (yes, this is no real problem 
since they probably are the same maintainer or just add the F: )

That produces just an executable file with a misleading name :) (test 
with two files were neither has a 'main()')
You need the '-c'-flag to tell the gcc just make them to object-files.

Mm, that is just a feature. Best to get the basics straighten out first :)

Absolutely, also it can easily refer to the "include header-files" by:
F:	include/linux/pci.h
which is not as easily done in "my" way. The local headers are ok I 
think as the c-files that includes it should have the same maintainer, 
but ex pci.h are used by _quite_ many drivers. But is the headers in the 
include/-directory just a matter for the maintainer since they are 
globally reachable. But I think this is _the_ downside of that approach.

No, since it is either a hit or it is not. Without wildcards, an entry like:
C:	CONFIG_IEEE1394
would not pick up ex CONFIG_IEEE1394_RAWIO.

You mean they update other maintainers entries? That would be good...

During development, that's a given. But I would hope that when its more 
stable it will always find the right answer or no answer at all (if 
there is errors in ex MAINTAINERS, even the human will bother the receiver)

I think it is to early to be thinking about what is easier, first a 
"algorithm" that does what we want is needed, then I'm more then happy 
to write a script/program for it :)
Costly?? It is even simple in bash:
C_FILE=${O_FILE/'.o'/'.c'}
this have then just to be checked if existing, otherwise it is a 
.s-file. And this is just a userspace-application, if it takes a minute 
to go throe 200 files I think that is no problem, just gives the 
programmer time to drink another Jolt Cola.
The main reason I hold on my idea is that I would like to use the 
build-system to insure any changes with filenames or such, do not mean 
any changing to MAINTAINERS (aka, can you build the driver, you will 
find the maintainer if they have added it to their entry). But was just 
thinking, what about using something like (this may be the best of the two):
C:	THE_CONFIG_FLAG
I:	linux/global-header.h
(I: for "include". Btw, what is F: standing for? Is it instead of P:?)
I: may be extended for other headers also but I can't think of any use 
since a header included by a file in the same directory or a directory 
above (shorter pathway) (have seen use of special h-directories just for 
the header-files. It may cost a cycle or two, but as I said: userspace 
and I think the programmer will waste many more when just 
correct-reading the patch :)
