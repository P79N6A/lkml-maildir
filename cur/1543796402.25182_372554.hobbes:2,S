Hmm. There is an obscure security problem. It was fixed in a bad way -
people want to say unicode_start and unicode_stop and find that that
fails today. Ach.
You argue "you can't keep an exploit open" - but as far as I can see
there is no problem that needs solving in kernel space.
For example - today login does a single vhangup() for the login tty.
In case that is a VC it could do a vhangup() for all VCs.
That looks like a better solution.
And "chmod u+s loadkeys" - you can't be serious..
