Yes that looks promising. If I recall correctly we had some strange top 
behaviours when we introduced the steal time. Old top added the steal time to 
idle. We should check that.

No hurry..that was specific to our implementation, not KVM :-)
Besided that, Ingo changed the accouting with his CFS scheduler, and I still 
have to figure out how CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING can be properly integrated 
in CFS.
