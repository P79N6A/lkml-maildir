adasi@kernel.pl asks:
    I've found it in manpages, but it's for kernel 1.3...
    Where can I find actual, full, briefly descripted list of ioctl's?
    WK
Probably none exists.
The proper place would be the Documentation/DocBook subdirectory
of the kernel source tree.
It would be a very good idea if someone started this by
nicely documenting some of the ioctls. Once there is a start
people will add to it until it is complete.
