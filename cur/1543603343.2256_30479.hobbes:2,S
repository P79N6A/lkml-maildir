Hi,
I would like to examine the CREDITS files of all/most kernels released over
time. How could I get my hands on these? I want to study the accumulation
of contributors over the years. This is part of my masters thesis project.
BTW, when was the current twofold stable/devel numbering scheme started?
Thanks,
