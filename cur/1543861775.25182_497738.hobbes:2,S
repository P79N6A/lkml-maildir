Hi Bart,
    I've tried to access the following link to make sure which it is,
but failed. The internet here   is almost broken.
    
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=ab17443a3df35abe4b7529e83511a591aa7384f3
   I sent out 2 patches for the same SB600 legacy IDE issue. the later
(sb600 pci qurik) is better so we should clean the previous patch
which was applied to atiixp.c. -- that is what this patch does.
    BTW, I re-create and re-send the patch (see below) based on
2.6.20-rc4, in last patch I fogot to rename atiixp.c.1 to atiixp.c
which may lead to patch fail, nothing else different.
    And maybe no need to re-ACK if last one is accepted:)
    Thanks!
