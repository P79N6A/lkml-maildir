Andrew,
When I do a make oldconfig under 2.6.18-rc5-mm1, with my working
2.6.18-rc5 .config file (appended below), all the LVM and MD stuff
gets blown away silently.  It looks like the drivers/md/Kconfig didn't
get updated properly when it was tweaked, possibly the new options to
get rid of BLOCK devices, or the ripping out of LVM1 stuff.
It looks like instead of 'if CONFIG_BLOCK' at the top, it just needs
to be 'if BLOCK' instead.  
And I'd really suggest that it NOT be this silly name BLOCK, something
more meaningful, like USE_BLOCK_DEVICES or something equally useful to
parse.
John
