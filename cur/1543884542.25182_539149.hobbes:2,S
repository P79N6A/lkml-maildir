I don't know if that would break any programs that are currently
bypassing the setup.  The existing setup protocol definitely allows
invoking an entry point which isn't 0x100000 (rather, the 32-bit
entrypoint is defined by code32_start); I'm not sure how Eric's
relocatable kernel patches (2.05 protocol) affect that, mostly because I
haven't seen any boot loaders which actually use it so I can't comment
on what their code looks like.
