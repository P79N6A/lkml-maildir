If you go back in the thread, you may find a link to a gitfs client that 
somebody kindly posted.  This client pretty much defines the transparency 
I'm talking about.  The only problem is that it's read-only.
To make it really useful, it has to support versioning locally, disconnected 
from the server repository.  One way to implement this, could be by 
committing every update unconditionally to an on-the-fly created git 
repository private to the gitfs client.
With this transparently created private scratch repository it should then be 
possible for the same gitfs to re-expose the locally created commits, all 
without any direct user-intervention.
Later, this same scratch repository could then be managed by the normal 
git-management tools/commands to ultimately update the backend git 
repositories.
BTW:  Sorry for my previous posts that contained the wrong date; it seems 
that hibernation sometimes advances the date by a full 24h.  Has anybody 
noticed this as well?
Thanks!
