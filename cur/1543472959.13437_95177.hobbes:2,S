Many banks will start upgrading their sw by December 30 / 31 after trade,
some even on 24th.  They don't believe everything will fly again on 24th,
so don't believe in the power of anything but cash and cheques ...  Only
a few banks so far have upgraded their sw; few will be able to complete
upgrading everything in time.
