For the same reason normal PC's still like to: no technical reason, except
for the fact that system vendors like to hide bugs and quirks by having
magic stuff in ACPI or PnPBIOS to tell the OS "hands off" or "this is how
to route this strange irq".
It's like ACPI: it would be a whole lot better if the hardware was just
standard and documented and didn't need any magic configuration tables and
strange code snippets to do magic acts of perversion. But sadly, it ain't 
so, and PnP and ACPI are there as imperfect ways of doing what needs to be 
done.
Of course, as with most system vendor crud, some BIOSes are more imperfect 
than others.
