So should we tie this driver to particular DMI signature(s) then? As far 
as I know it is only useful for the Eee 900 and possibly the 701 when 
running later BIOSes.

Running with wifi and the screen off, and the CPU busy (doing m5sum of 
/dev/zero) I get 2:37 run time at 900MHz and 3:09 at 630MHz so the 
increase in run time is about 20% on that test.
