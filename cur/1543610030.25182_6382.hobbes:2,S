	Hello,
	I would like to know if it is possible to limit the maximum
cache used by a device. If not, wouldn't it be usefull? for example,
you may want to limit the maximum cache used for /video (big IDE HD)
to the minimum necesary to let you write arbitrary sized files to the
HD, so you don't need to fix your files size. It would be usefull also
to limit the cache, so /usr or /var or even /lib get enough cached as
to allow important bits are keep in memory. Of course this could be
set as a mount option. If setting absolute cache percent or size isn't
nice, it could be done using priority settings.
	Regards,
