Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: preserve the ebx value in acpi_copy_wakeup_routine
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Tian Kevin <kevin.tian@intel.com>
Register %ebx serves as the "global offset table base register"
for position-independent code. For absolute code, %ebx serves
as a local register and has no specified role in the function
calling sequence. In either case, a function must preserve the
register value for the caller.
acpi_copy_wakeup_routine overrides %ebx without saving it,
this may corrupt the called data.
Kevin found that most time the value of Sx is saved in %esi,
however sometimes compiler also uses %ebx. When this happens,
suspends fails since sleep value in ebx is changed by
acpi_copy_wakeup_routine.
The same funtion in X86_64 doesn't have this problem.
