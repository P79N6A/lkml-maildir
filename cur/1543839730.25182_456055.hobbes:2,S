:) And I pointed quite a few other issues about enums vs. defines.
According to this one - no one wants to watch enums in debugger.
And, ugh:
(gdb) list
1       enum {
2               A = 1,
3               B = 2,
4       };
5
6       int main()
7       {
8               printf("%x\n", A | B);
9       }
(gdb) bre 8
Breakpoint 1 at 0x4004ac: file ./test.c, line 8.
(gdb) r
Starting program: /tmp/test 
Breakpoint 1, main () at ./test.c:8
8               printf("%x\n", A | B);
(gdb) p A
No symbol "A" in current context.
Actually I completely do not care about define or enums, it is really
silly dispute, I just do not want to rewrite bunch of code _again_ and
then _again_ when someone decide that defines are better.
