Well it's free in terms of money, read: download and "personal usage"
blabla.
This doesn't deterr me from having a look at it ;-).

Yes I was impressed as well and twiddeling with compiler flags is 
actually indicating that the calling convention stuff is one
of the main contributors to this. BTW.> The speed differences 
can go up to 40% for floating point, OK this is irrelevant for
the kernel but it is showing very well that there is still
plenty of room for improvement.
