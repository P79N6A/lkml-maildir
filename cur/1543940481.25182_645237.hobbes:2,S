Yes in this patchset I have taken your sg branch at the time, and
rebased it ontop of scsi_data_buffer patch. Because I felt that
it is more natural for this patch to come after the scsi total
cleanup that is scsi_data_buffer. Then the extraction to sg_table
is simple and trivial.
What I meant to point out with this patch is that all the exact same
places that are touched there should be fixed when moving to sg_table.
Look at it. It is a revised version of your patch.

I mean the patches that where in sg branch of the linux-block tree, But
I see that it is now to late, and that they are in Linus already
James the most simple is to submit the scsi_data_buff patch that fixes
all these places. If not do you want that I send in fixes?
