Actually, the *only* point being contended here is running older
kernels on some newer filesystems (created originally with a newer
kernel), right?
Or do you have examples of where current kernels could not deal
with an ext3 feature at some point in time?
I would argue that 0.001% of all Linux *users* actually worry about
this - most of them are right here on the development mailing list.
So, that group is more vocal, for sure.  But, if it works for 99.99+%
users, aren't we still on the good path, from the point of view of
those people who actually *use* Linux the most?
