ThermalZone objects hang under _TZ, whether TZ it be global, or under _SB
I would think that if there are no ThermalZone objects,
then we'd not need to bind the thermal driver.
However, this would be a custom binding method (like acpi video.c)
rather than a HID based one.
I'm really not sure about the _TZ_ syntax -- we'll have to ask Bob
where that came from when he returns -- but I don't think it matters
for the issue at hand.

I agree that it is still new and that it is unlikely that a re-name
now would be a significant compatibility issue.

We've had this discussion before.
I'm inclined to keep the kernel as simple as possible, and let
some user-space thingie look up standard strings in some user-space table.
I don't want to get into the game of trying to make sysfs
so user-friendly, that a kernel re-build is necessary to add/translate
a new string...
that said, if we have to _invent_ a new string, it might as well
be something meaningful to a human.

it is really irritating to end up with two nearly identical definitions.
it is also irritating to diverge from ACPICA for syntax reasons.
I don't really have a better idea -- though I'd be inclined to call it
acpica_device_id instead of __acpi_device_id if we're stuck with that route.
