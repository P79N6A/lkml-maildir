At the end of boot, Linux kernel tries to fork init.
If it fails, /bin/sh is forked.
It means that If someone can alter init (with a tmp race for 
example), then reboot, it will have all access to the system.
I think that /bin/sh should only be forked when asked at boot time
with init= parameter (its use beeing protected by lilo password)
