Hi all.
We are trying to install the 2.2.7 on a Siemens Primergy 870
edition.
The problem is at the boot, since the system actually does
not boot at all... the only message is "Uncompressing the
kernel... Ok now booting linux"
However, with a non SMP 2.0.36 kernel, the system boots and
performs very well.
Any advice would be appreciated.
Bye
