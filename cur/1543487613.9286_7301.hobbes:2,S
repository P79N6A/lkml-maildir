But Alan, they were talking about competing with 386 and 486's - I
know that the Strongarm doesn't have any L2$ (though you can get around
that problem with some clever board design, I've been working on that),
and it is integer, etc.  But even so, it way outperforms the machines
he was talking about.  Or do you know something I don't?
