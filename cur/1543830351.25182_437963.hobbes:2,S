I'm just sharing my experience.
You have one experience, I have another, and your classification of traffic
importance is not the universal one.
My point was that we shouldn't overestimate the use of INET sockets vs. UNIX
ones in configurations where communications but not web/db operations play a
big role in overall performance.
And indeed I've talked with many different people, from universities to
large enterprises.

Why not for the masses?
