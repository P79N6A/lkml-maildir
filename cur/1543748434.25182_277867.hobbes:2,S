Hi.

OK, perhaps this one is better, at least
it no longer plays on gcc optimization,
so that I can reproduce the Oopses again,
for good and for test-case.
But I think you really should consider
checking regs->xcs instead of explicitly
checking the corner cases like 0xcd,3.

I already did - it was my very first test-case
which produced the Oops on the if(*addr!=...)
dereference, but you worked around by checking
the VM flag (well, it must be checked, but
not after you already used "addr" a couple of
times, IMHO).
OK, but if you need another test-case,
here it is. Much simpler than the vm86 one.
It can work in 2 modes: started without args,
it will print the diagnostic (passed or
failed) and exit. If started with any arg,
it will Oops the kernel.
This happens both with your latest patch
and without it. This doesn't happen with
your previous patch (no Oops), but then fixing
problems by exploiting the gcc optimization
was not the best idea I think.
