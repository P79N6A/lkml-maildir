Maybe I'm dreaming something up here but why can't you either
- show your version of the code
or
- tell exactly why a microchange is bad and what you need the
  particular structure for
?
It would definitely make more sense to share your IDE experience
sourcecodewise than to bitch about things you claim other people
cannot know.
