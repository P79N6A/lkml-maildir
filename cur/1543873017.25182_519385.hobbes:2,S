Yet looking at the mainline scheduler code, nice 5 tasks are also supposed to 
get 75% cpu compared to nice 0 tasks, however I cannot seem to get 75% cpu 
with a fully cpu bound task in the presence of an interactive task. To me 
that means mainline is not living up to my expectations. What you're saying 
is your expectations are based on a false cpu expectation from nice 5. You 
can spin it both ways. It seems to me the only one that lives up to a defined 
expectation is to be fair. Anything else is at best vague, and at worst 
starvation prone.

How about answering my question then since I offered you numerous combinations 
of ways to tackle the problem? The simplest one doesn't even need code, it 
just needs you to alter the nice value that you're already setting.
