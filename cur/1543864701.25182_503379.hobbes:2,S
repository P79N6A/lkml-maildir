I probably should say "that depends", but that wouldn't be very helpful.
Getting back to your initial question, which is if wake_up() may be called
from a driver's .resume() routine, I think the answer is no, it may not,
because in that case the "notified" tasks would be removed from the wait
queue, but the refrigerator() would (wrongly) restore their states as
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE (or TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE for wake_up_interruptible()).
Generally, you are safe if your driver only calls wake_up() from a process
context, but not from .resume() or .suspend() routines (or from an
unfreezeable kernel thread).
Greetings,
Rafael
