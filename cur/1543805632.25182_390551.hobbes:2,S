OK, this is getting silly and downright offensive. I encourage
everyone else to look over the code to see that I am right.
I may just be crazy enough to fork this project. I very nearly
did about 18 months ago. I can't very well do this alone,
because I don't have all the hardware. (It's either cdrecord
or Asterisk -- I'm not sure which one pisses me off the most)
Me:
* was an RTOS developer
* day job is all about secure software
* the procps maintainer
* running Linux 2.6.xx only
* using FireWire, which is totally hot-plug
Perhaps the first thing to do would be to find a list of all the
apps that depend on cdrecord. Their interface to cdrecord
needs to be documented so that a compatibility script can
be made.
Matthias, can you give me a hand with this? I'll need a way
to sort and publish incoming patches, letting them sit for a
while. (like what Andrew Morton does for the kernel) This
can't work like procps because the hardware varies too much.
