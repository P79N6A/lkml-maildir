i definitely agree and do that for all code i write.
But if someone does item by item initialization for some crazy 
performance reason (networking folks tend to have such constructs), it 
should be done i think how i've done it in the patch: by systematically 
listing _every_ field in the structure, in the same order, and 
indicating it clearly when it is not initialized and why.
and there it already shows that we do not initialize a few other members 
that could cause problems later on:
+       rq->data_len                    = 0;
+       /* rq->sense_len                        */
+       rq->data                        = NULL;
+       rq->sense                       = NULL;
why is sense_len not initialized - while data_len is? In any case, these 
days the memclear instructions are dirt cheap and we should just always 
initialize everything to zero by default, especially if it's almost all 
zero-initialized anyway.
