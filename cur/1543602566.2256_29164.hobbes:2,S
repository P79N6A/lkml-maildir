find /usr/src/linux -type f -exec grep mmu_gathers -n {} \; -ls
and for some funny reason, the arch/ppc/mm/init.c is the only one that does not have the lines 
#include <asm/tlb.h>
mmu_gather_t mmu_gathers[NR_CPUS];
in it.
Sorry for no proper patch.  It is too late and I am too lazy.
Anyway, there is some funny video driver issue or something, I have to use prevent xdm from trying to start
or this bugger will hang .. or at least I lose the video display and the monitor power light blinks on and off.
Also if I run gpm and select a line of text on the console I get the highlighted area turning into
funny non-printable characters and happy faces and such.
Good night.
oh: Without the above patch the kernel build fails right at the end when linking mm.o with others and complains
about no reference to mm_gathers in zap_page_reg or something like that.
