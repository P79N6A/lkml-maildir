No, this code is ok.

No, they are not.  The _SUN4C_PAGE_SILENT_READ is the bit that allows
reading the page without trapping.  If it's not set, you trap, and
do_sun4c_fault tests _SUN4C_PAGE_READ with no special case for
user/kernel.  Since PROT_NONE doesn't include that bit, it's an oops.

Correct, although I recently fixed this in my tree.  It now builds but
nobody has tested it in ages and I believe it doesn't work.
