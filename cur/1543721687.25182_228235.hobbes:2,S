Hi!
I have been using the 2.6.x series kernels sence 2.6.2 and everything just
worked fine for me, great job!
A few days ago the 2.6.7 kernel was released and of course i tried to
install it on my system. My problem is that i am not able to find
"Auto-Geometry Resizing support" in make menuconfig. I think that this
parameter is called CONFIG_IDEDISK_STROKE in the .config file. I am not
able to find it in the .config either ...........
I have tried to locate information about this in the release notes for the
2.6.7 kernel and on 
http://www.lkml.org
 without success.
best regards
