If you don't like vi (anyone like vi ?), use something else like pico or
emacs.  Actually emacs makes a reasonably good intergrated development
enviroment as you can invoke gdb under it and get a split window with the
source in one half, and the gdb session in the other.  Start the program
in an xterm and attach to it then and you can even see what the front end
is doing.
I seem to remember an IDE that looks like either the Visual C, or
Borderland IDE, I've never used it, but you should be able to find it
without too much effort (search the Linux Software Map (LSM) if your
stuck).
