Ok, now the other part of making PCI devices work is to support
mmap.  In most cases, that means remap_page_range() is used which
is stuck with an unsigned long physical address.  For example,
should we really have a remap_resource_range() in FB drivers to
handle mmap?  This could use arch-specific resource information
to get a 36-bit physical address (PPC44x) and maybe get rid of
some of the in-driver per-arch address munging.
My local tree has an ugly hack to remap_page_range() (and friends)
so it uses a phys_addr_t and calls fixup_bigphys_addr() to allow
use of unmodified PCI FB drivers.  I'd like to get this working
without hacks. :)
