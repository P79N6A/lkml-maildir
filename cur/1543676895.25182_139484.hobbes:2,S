So it's another initcall problem in the PCI layer.
pci_enable_device_bars() is needing things which are not yet set up.  A lot
of the PCI initialisation is at subsys_initcall() as well, and you got
unlucky with link order.
I expect the below patch will fix this as well.  Could you please put the
above change back to normal and see if this one fixes it?
