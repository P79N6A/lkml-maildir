Two issues on USB:
First:
USB-HDD boot device hangs
Tested with Kernel 2.6.16.13-4 (SuSE), Kernel 2.6.17, Kernel 2.6.17-mm2, Kernel 2.6.17-mm3
it works, it hangs, it gets reseted, it works again until next hang, and on ...
The only hint in dmesg is:
usb 1-2.7: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 6
The USB-HDD device works fine if connected as USB-HDD device, not as USB-HDD _boot_ device,
tested with Kernel 2.6.16.13-4 (SuSE) on different mainboard, booting not tested
Second:
Not ending USB device disconnect and reconnect
Tested with Kernel 2.6.16.13-4 (SuSE), it works fine
Tested with Kernel 2.6.17, Kernel 2.6.17-mm2, Kernel 2.6.17-mm3
dmesg shows:
