The ideal would be to allow viewing:
1. killable processes (that is, YOU can kill them)
2. processes sharing a tty with a killable process
Optionally, add:
3. processes controlling a tty master of a killable process
4. ancestors of all of the above
5. children of killable processes
This is of course expensive, but maybe you can get some of
it cheaply. For example, allow viewing a process if the session
leader, group leader, parent, or tpgid process is killable.
