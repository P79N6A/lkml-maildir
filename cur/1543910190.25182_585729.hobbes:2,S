in the Blackfin port, if you want to use a pin as an IRQ rather than
GPIO, you use the normal request_irq/free_irq API ... those functions
will call back into the proper GPIO/PORTMUX code so that the pin is
setup properly.  this is done so that code isnt duplicated across
files and so that we can easily detect if someone does something
incorrect like try to take the same pin and use it as
irq/gpio/whatever at the same time ...
are you saying that other ports dont unify the backend code paths at all ?
