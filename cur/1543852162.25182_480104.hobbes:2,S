Well this is a rathole so it really isn't safe for lspci to play with
(races with the kernel accessing it)
This hole concept of you having the register but not connecting it up on
the card is rather bizarre.

Fine by me.  That's why the patch was up for review.  That is just moving
the if statement I currently have.  So it should be trivial.  If that
won't break your card that is good enough for me.
