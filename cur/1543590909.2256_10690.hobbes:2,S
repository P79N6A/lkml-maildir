ncpfs uses 'unsigned long' in its ncp_mount_data_v4, as MIPS uses
'long' type for uid/gid. Unfortunately it still needs conversions
on some archs, so maybe using u_int64_t is just best solution
(AFAIK as MIPS unsigned long is 64bit, you have to use u_int64_t
if you want same type accross architectures).
Kernel part then just checks wheter uid == (__kernel_uid_t)uid and 
gives up if they differ.
