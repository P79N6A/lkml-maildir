What Criteria Determine Acceptance
----------------------------------
Licensing:      The code must be released to us under the GNU public license.
                We don't insist on any kind of exclusively GPL licensing,
                and if you wish the driver to be useful to other communities
This should be worded correctly as "GNU General Public
License" to avoid any confusion or ambiguity.  There is no such
thing as the "GNU public license" and newcomers may be confused.
This is just a minor point, but valid nonetheless for proper
documentation.
