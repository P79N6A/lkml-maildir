OK, let me put it that way: we need to turn stat() into method call
rather than blind access to inode fields.  Then all these problems
will be very easy to deal with.  Variants of such patch exist and
there is no reasons preventing them that stuff in 2.4 (i.e. no
changes are required in filesystems), but it still needs more local
testing.
