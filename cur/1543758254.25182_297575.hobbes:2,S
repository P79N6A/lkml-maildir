I saw drivers/acorn/char/i2c.c, but this file is always built statically 
on ARCH_ACORN without any dependency between ARCH_ACORN and I2C.
This is buggy.
Why can't such drivers select I2C and other required I2C_* variables?
Appropriate depends or selects are required in any case.
If you plan to make drivers like drivers/acorn/char/i2c.c modular, my 
patch is void.
