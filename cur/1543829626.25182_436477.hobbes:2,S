However, any binaries created with that in mind would be 
buggy-by-definition on older kernels, so I don't think it's worth it.

Right, but it's not backwards-compatible with old kernels ;(
So any user space app that does it would have to be pretty crazy.
I don't think it's a huge advantage anyway. x86 CPU's are really good at 
tracking %esp - there are papers out there that talk about how %esp is the 
limiter for effective IPC, but modern x86 CPU's will generally have ways 
around it, so in _practice_ I think you can do
	subl $16,%esp
	movl %eax,4(%esp)
without having any address stall on the subtract on most modern CPU cores 
(because the core will break the dependency and track %esp specially).
That's the Yonah "stack engine", afaik. And I could obviously name other 
CPU's that does it too, but I probably shouldn't ;)
