I cannot see how can find_trylock_page be affected by my anon_vma
changes. The only difference I can see is taht Andrew's -mm writeback
code is adding the _irq to the spinlocks there and I don't see other
obvious changes in that function. I included all -mm writeback changes
primarly to avoid me to maintain two slightly different versions of
anon_vma and secondly to nuke the page->list. Other trees I'm dealing
with daily have those applied already.  At the very least that
additional cost that you measured cannot be associated in any way with
the allocation and maintainace of the anon_vma, since that
find_trylock_page cost is a per-page pagecache thing absolutely
unrelated to the anon_vmas costs.
It's probably best that I port my version of objrmap (basically the same
as yours but with the shm swapout fixes) + anon_vma to your tree, it's
not a big effort to do the porting once, I applied Andrew's patches
primarly to avoid porting back and forth all the time.
Just tell me which is exactly the codebase I should port against and
I'll send you a patch shortly.
Thanks!
