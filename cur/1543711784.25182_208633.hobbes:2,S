non-static == exported for people to use, declared in a header, and
without the "static" qualifier to the function. Basically, things added
to the kernel API. As this is the low-level bitmap stuff, I believe it
should be relatively unchanged across whatever API changes you may have
in store for higher-level API's e.g. cpumasks. This is the bitmap
library code we're talking about, isn't it? At least it's what I'm
talking about.
