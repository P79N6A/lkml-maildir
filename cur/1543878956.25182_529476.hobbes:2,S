Hmm - the only think I have used in the past is tcpdump/libpcap from
http://public.lanl.gov/cpw/
Documentation/networking/packet_mmap.txt also seems to be a little dated, but 
does have some code snippets if you wanted to make something lightweight...
Does anyone else on netdev have a small test app?
