 I don't see any replies to this, so here's my 2¢. The simple model of
what a webserver does when sending static data is:
1. local_disk_fd = open()
2. fstat(local_disk_fd)
3. TCP_CORK on
4. send_headers();
5. LOOP
5a. sendfile(network_con_fd, local_disk_fd)
5b. epoll(network_con_fd)
6. TCP_CORK off
...and here's my personal plan (again, somewhat simplified), which I
think will be "better":
7. helper_proc_pipe_fd = DO open() + fstat()
8. read_stat_event_data(helper_proc_pipe_fd)
9. TCP_CORK on network_con_fd
10. send_headers(network_con_fd);
11. LOOP
11a. splice(helper_proc_pipe_fd, network_con_fd)
11b. epoll(network_con_fd && helper_proc_pipe_fd)
12. TCP_CORK off network_con_fd
...where the "helper proc" is doing splice() from disk to the pipe, on the
other end. This, at least in theory, gives you an async webserver and zero
copy disk to network[1]. My assumption is that Evgeniy's aio_sendfile()
could fit into that model pretty easily, and would be faster.
 However, from what you've said above you're only trying to help #1 and #2
(which are likely to be cached in the app. anyway) and apps.
that want to sendfile() to the network either do horrible hacks like
lighttpd's "AIO"[2], do a read+write copy loop with AIO or don't use AIO.
[1] And allows things like IO limiting, which aio_sendfile() won't.
