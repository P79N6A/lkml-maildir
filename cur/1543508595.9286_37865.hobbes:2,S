Folks,
I'm unable to get 2.2.12 (it's my first 2.2.x attempt) to run on a SS20, 
currently running RedHat Linux 5.1 and kernel 2.0.35. The main difference 
between myself and most of the rest of the world is that I MUST be able to 
manage this machine via a serial console. Thus, the following inittab entry:
s2:12345:respawn:/sbin/getty ttyS0 9600
I took RedHat's kernel .config file for a single-processor setup, and built 
and installed 2.2.12 painlessly. I added the image to silo.conf, and booted 
from the new kernel. I got as far as:
Turning on user and group quotas for local filesystems                          Setting clock: Sun Sep  5 18:09:11 PDT 1999                                     Enabling swap space.                                                            Initializing random number generator...                                         zs_open ttyS0, tty overwrite.                                                   zs_open ttyS0, tty overwrite.                                                   zs_open ttyS0, tty overwrite.
[snip about 20-30 of these]
zs_open ttyS0, tty overwrite.                                                   zs_open ttyS0, tty overwrite.                                                   eth0: Carrier Lost, trying TPE 
At this point the machine is ping-able, but does not seem to fire up any 
services, and I don't see anything more which looks like a boot sequence on 
the serial console. So I hit return on the serial link just to see if it would 
still scroll.
The kernel OOPSed at this point. All kinds of nasty stuff written to the
console, which I could have hardly transcribed to paper and which is now lost
forever :-(. I tried sending a few breaks via minicom, but whatever they did,
if anything, I never got back to the PROM's "ok" prompt. Eventually the screen
just settled into a tight, seemingly uninterruptible loop:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 40001000              Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 40001000              Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 40001000              Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 40001000              Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 40001000              Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 40001000
which scrolls endlessly, very rapidly, and I was unable to get a BREAK to get
me back to the PROM.
Someone else has seen this problem and posted on sparc-list@redhat.com:

Any advice on how to troubleshoot this welcomed, with thanks. Is this likely 
to be a genuine kernel bug? If so, I guess my frightening task will be to try 
to get some more firm diagnostics on the exact oops . . . frightening because 
I risk losing the ability to manage/reset the machine.
