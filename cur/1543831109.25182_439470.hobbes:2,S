	Well, to be fair, I'm just going by what little I know about
XFS.  They maintain a cache of all pages waiting on delayed allocation
for writepack.  Why have this entire cache (hash, list, whatever) when
we could create some state on in the pagecache?  We save a large chunk
of memory and some complex writeback code.  I suspect you were thinking
of this when you said "mpage_writepage(s) handling".  But this is a
large complexity win if we can do it.
	The same with metadata/data ordering issues.  ie, data=ordered
or even plain "creat(2); write(2)".  I don't know how generic the
ordering is for each filesystem, but there is always room for play.
	On-disk, of course each filesystem is going to be different.
I'm not sure we could fit a fully-generic aops->reserve_space() &
aops->commit_space() API.  But I don't think we need to.
