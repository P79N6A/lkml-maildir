Subject: loop: auto-load crypto module [PATCH]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It seems odd that "losetup -e blowfish" will auto-load the blowfish module
if it's not already loaded but it doesn't work if the cryptoloop module
isn't loaded.  It's fairly simple to amend loop so that it requests
a crypto module when required - a sample patch appears below.  Just put
"alias loop-encrypt-18 cryptoloop" in your modprobe.conf.  This currently
fails silently if the module isn't found - I don't know whether it's
worth putting a message in there.
On an unrelated note, while looking at loop.c I noticed that loop_init
contains two calls to memset for the same block of memory (one outside
the for-loop, one inside).  It seems to me that one of these isn't
necessary.  :-)
