I looked at it, but I still prefer allocating uncachable space rather
than setting the cache mode afterwards. Are there cases where you want to
toggle the cache mode of a given range more than once ?
I prefer avoiding walking the page tables the way it's done in
kernel_set_cachemode. Adding the GPF_UNCACHED flag seems a lot more
maintainable to me, and requires really very few changes to implement.
But, of course, I may be wrong...
