It's a DMA issue.  The chip raised an irq to signal the error condition
to the driver, thats why it is printed by the irq handler.  Happened
while streamimg mpeg data.
Havn't looked at the code for years now, but IIRC the 0x800000 is the
raw error code from some status register, pci_abort is the error bit in
clear text, meaning some PCI DMA transfer was aborted.  No idea why
though ...
