Agreed. I just said Chuck that I would have extracted the rbtree patch
against 2.2.6. I _completly_ agree and right now I am also _very_ worried
by performances of RB in the buffer cache. The rb-cache per-inode is
almost sure a win according to me, but a global RB for all the page cache
and one for all the buffer cache (as I am running now) is not so obviously
a win and need accurate testing. With a global RB for all the buffer cache
I get my usual 116mbyte/sec of hdparm -T (as with the hash table). gdbm
software seems to stess them really a lot, but I never run on a 2.2.6 with
only my rb-tree patch so I don't know if the rb are a bottleneck (as it
seems) or if they are just rasonable fast.

Ah and I am worried only by find time not by insert/delete time.
insert/delete time seems perfectly OK.
Tomorrow I'll try to find the time to generate a rb-patch for 2.2.6 with
all the page cache in one rbtree. And one second incremental incremental
against the first one that will put also the buffer cache in a
separate rbtree.
