Yep!  This is what the Alpha architects eventually beat into my head
when I first encountered this issue.  ;-)

As I understand it, this "feature" allows the CPU to avoid stalling as
often, thereby increasing performance.  Which is presumably somewhat offset
by extra rmb()s on Alpha.

Right, and omitting this synchronization between CPU and cache presumably
decreases stalls and increases performance.
Here is my scorecard thus far on CPUs that run SMP Linux:
     SMP CPU        Data dependencies create implicit rmb()?
     Alpha          No
     i386      Yes
     IA64      Yes
     MIPS      Yes *
     MIPS64         Yes *
     PA-RISC        Yes *
     PPC       Yes
     S390      Yes
     S390X          Yes
     SPARC          Yes
     *MIPS & MIPS64: Still don't have my MIPS manual, basing this on
          earlier experience with MIPS.  Any comments from the SGI
          guys?
     *PA-RISC: Based on my reading of the PA RISC architecture manual,
          particularly the SYNC instruction and definition of the
          memory model.  However, this manual is not completely
          unambiguous.  Comments from someone in the know at HP?
     Non-SMP CPUs include: arm, cris, m68k, sh
So unless I missed something, Alpha stands alone here, as the only CPU
that does not provide some way for data dependencies to act as implicit
rmb()s.
Don't get me wrong -- I am quite impressed with the way Alpha avoids
stalls in many cases, while getting a level of synchronization that is
useful in many cases.  I just wish that they had also provided more heavy
weight memory barriers so that we aren't forced to choose between IPIs for
Alpha and lots of rmb()s sprinkled through the code, uglifying it and
slowing down all the other SMP CPUs.
Given the discussion on this topic over the past few days, and on earlier
discussions, I would argue that the Alpha semantics for wmb() and rmb()
are strongly counter-intuitive.  People seem to expect a wmb()-like
primitive that allows read-side data dependencies to act as implicit
rmb() instructions.  All the CPUs except for Alpha provide an instruction
that can act as such a wmb()-like instruction, and Alpha can simulate
such an instruction with IPIs.
And this line of reasoning lead me to send out the wmbdd() patch.  ;-)
Thoughts?
                              Thanx, Paul
