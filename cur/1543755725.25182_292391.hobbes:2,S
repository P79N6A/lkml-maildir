Subject: PPC64 - missing mem=xxx parameter parsing

Hello,
  I'm trying to port a device driver that works under 32 bit linux (both
ppc and x86)
to ppc64.  The driver expected the memory on the system to be
partitioned using the
'mem=xxx' boot parameter settings such that linux use the lower xxx and
remaining 
physical memory was treated as a contiguous ramdisk, with the driver
handling the
file-system related details.  The 'mem=' option does not exist under
ppc64, and
I was wondering what would break if I copied the appropriate ports of
arch/ppc/mm/init.c
into arch/ppc64/mm/init.c  Any ideas?
  Please cc me on any replies....
