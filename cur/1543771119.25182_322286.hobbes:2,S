True, list_add() vs. 200+ lines of code .. I've added our plist to fusyn
with no ill effects. As Oleg suggested I used some userspace code to check
what it was doing, while I was working on it. I've fairly confident in it,
however I do still have some concerns for the same reasons you do.
I could do some cleanup on it, some comments are wrong now. That and a
test suite, maybe that will change the confidence level.
