I'm now considering a yet different approach that's more along the lines
how digitizers (tablets) are handled:
BTN_TOOL_FINGER
BTN_TOOL_DOUBLETAP
BTN_TOOL_TRIPLETAP
for telling what the user used to point ... and
ABS_AREA or ABS_WIDTH or ABS_TOOL_WIDTH
to tell how the touched area is large.

I hope it could, but not many touchpad drivers report all the stuff they
know like the Synaptics ones. Most do all the processing straight
within the pad processor.

Not at the moment. We could add physical range values it if it becomes
needed, though. From this the userspace portion of the driver can
compute the resolution.

The direction of the coordinates is defined to be constant in the API,
so you should reverse it in the driver if you detect a pad with a
reversed Y coordinate.
