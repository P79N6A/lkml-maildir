This looks very similar to what I see with my regular ATA drive (except
that the completions are handled in hardirq context).
You can cause less work to be done in each softirq by
lowering /sys/block/$DEV/queue/max_sectors_kb.
I would not consider ~2ms "long", there are some other softirqs that
induce 10-15ms latencies...
