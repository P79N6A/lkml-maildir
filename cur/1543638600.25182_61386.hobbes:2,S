I can't agree. What you can say is that if you enable warnings
from the beginning, it's much easier because you prevent those
warnings, if you get them a couple of times. 
If you upgrade your compiler, it can issue new warnings,
like you see when using gcc 3.x, or e.g. when changing from 2.8.x to
2.95.x.

It can also mean that a software engineer has done a good job ;-)
Always look for -Wall as a start when using the gcc compiler.
