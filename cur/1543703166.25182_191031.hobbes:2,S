2.6 has been working great on my soekris net4801 (see
http://www.soekris.com/net4801.htm
) dns server/firewall and since it
uses a compact flash card for root, I implemented /dev on tmpfs using
udev, and it all works using the sysfs patches in the mm series kernels.
I've just rebooted using 2.6.1-mm3 (I'll let you know if there are any
problems).
