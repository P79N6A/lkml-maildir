Why do you think the IO layer should get larger requests?
I really don't understand why people dislike plugging. It's obviously 
superior to non-plugged variants, exactly because it starts the IO only 
when _needed_, not at some random "IO request feeding point" boundary.
In other words, plugging works _correctly_ regardless of any random 
up-stream patterns. That's the kind of algorithms we want, we do NOT want 
to have the IO layer depend on upstream always doing the "Right 
Thing(tm)".
So exactly why would you want to remove it?
