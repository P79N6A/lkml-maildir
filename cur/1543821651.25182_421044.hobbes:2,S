I applied latest Francois patch and the changes (and specially the dma
changes) seems to be ok.
On the other hand i'm having some problems. Nothing related to the
patches, because it happens with the original driver too: After some
time using it, the driver becomes unresponsive and i need to restart
the interface and/or unload-load the ipg module. I'd need to compile
it with debug enabled when i have some time to see what it's going
on...
cheers,
