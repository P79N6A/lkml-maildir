Also disagree; besides, the evidence implies that Keith is wrong.  GCC
2.95.3:
drow@nevyn:~% cat strlen.c
int foo() { return strlen ("baz"); }
int bar() { return sizeof ("baz") - 1; }
drow@nevyn:~% cat strlen.s
        .file   "strlen.c"
        .version        "01.01"
gcc2_compiled.:
.text
        .align 4
.globl foo
        .type    foo,@function
foo:
        pushl %ebp
        movl %esp,%ebp
        movl $3,%eax
        leave
        ret
.Lfe1:
        .size    foo,.Lfe1-foo
        .align 4
.globl bar
        .type    bar,@function
bar:
        pushl %ebp
        movl %esp,%ebp
        movl $3,%eax
        leave
        ret
.Lfe2:
        .size    bar,.Lfe2-bar
        .ident  "GCC: (GNU) 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease)"
3.2 does the same thing.  With -fomit-frame-pointer the results are as
expected, just a move and a return.
If you include headers that define strlen, that's another problem.
