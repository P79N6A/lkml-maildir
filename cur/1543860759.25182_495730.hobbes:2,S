Subject: [PATCH] Re: [Bug 7210] New: Clone flag CLONE_PARENT_TIDPTR leaves invalid results in memory.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Daniel Jacobowitz <dan@codesourcery.com>
Do not implement CLONE_PARENT_SETTID until we know that clone will succeed.
If we do it too early NPTL's data structures temporarily reference a
non-existant TID.

I never got back to you about this...
Refresher, if there isn't enough above: CLONE_PARENT_SETTID is
currently implemented right after a TID is assigned.  There's a lot of
clone left to go at that point including a check for pending signals
which can lead to clone failing.  This leaves a TID in NPTL's thread
list which doesn't correspond to a thread.
I found Sunday another place where this is a problem, besides the
process-global UID stuff in glibc.  GDB tries to attach to the
nonexistant thread and gets upset.  I've made it cope, but at the same
time it provides a convenient test case.
Without the attached patch, tls.exp in the GDB testsuite would
intermittently report that it could not attach to a thread - always
within half an hour.  With the patch it ran for four hours without
a problem.
