Hello,
I have just upgraded kernel (2.6.16.x->2.6.18.1) on on of my servers (Dell 
PowerEdge1425SC with 2 CPUs with HT - total 4 CPUs) and noticed that 
system no longer uses HPET as a clocksource.
# cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource
acpi_pm jiffies hpet tsc pit
# cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
tsc
AFAIK TSC should not be used on SMP systems, shouldn't it?
Best regards,
