It is no problem to use the same Makefile for both 2.4.x and 2.5.x,
and even let the Makefile do the RightThing[tm] in case the user just
types 'make'.  My Makefiles for kernel stuff look like this (stripped
down a bit):
==============================[ cut here ]==============================
ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
# call from kernel build system
obj-m	:= btaudio.o
-include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make
else
KDIR	:= /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
PWD	:= $(shell pwd)
default:
	$(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) modules
endif
==============================[ cut here ]==============================
If you need different stuff for 2.4.x and 2.5.x you can handle it
using ifeq ($(VERSION).$(PATCHLEVEL),2.4)
