The compressed file is still cached, and the library can cache
file contents in a shared mapping.  It does not have to
be a per-process thing.

I don't worry about mozilla exploits - you get those from
nasty webpages as well.  I worried about a decompressor
cras (or random memory overwrite).  A userland implementation
will crash that particular userland process, with no ill effects on 
the rest of the system. 
A kernelside crash is much worse - it can hang the kernel and/or
mess up any process.  As for exploits - an in-kernel exploit
is even worse than a root exploit.  There are plenty
of thing even root can't do - at least not in 
straightforward ways.  The kernel has no limitations
whatsoever for what may go wrong.
