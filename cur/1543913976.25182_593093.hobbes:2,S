While I agree with your concern, those numbers are quite silly.  The
chances of 99.8% of pages being free and the remaining 0.2% being
perfectly spread across all 2MB large_pages are lower than those of SHA1
creating a collision.  I don't see anyone abandoning git or rsync, so
your extreme example clearly is the wrong one.
Again, I agree with your concern, even though your example makes it look
silly.

speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.
