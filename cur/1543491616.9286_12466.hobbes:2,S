Two things: first of all, the default rlimit for open files is still
1024, so you need to raise that to use more in one process.  From bash,
that's 
	ulimit -Hn 100000; ulimit -n 100000
or use the setrlimit() kernel call.
Secondly, the default FD_SET type only has space for 1024 fds in the
bitmap, so either make sure you are using poll, or define your own,
sufficiently large, FD_SET if you need to use select.
Other than that, all should work.
