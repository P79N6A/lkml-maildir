Heh, right. I guess I was thinking about request_irq/free_irq when I
chose those names. I'll change them.

Exactly. If we can decide on what the prototypes should look like and
which header they should be in, the architecture is free to implement
it any way it chooses. If speed is more important than
chip-independence, they can even be inlines accessing the hardware
directly.

The SPI driver in this series is an example of an at least somewhat
platform-independent driver touching GPIOs. MMC and CompactFlash drivers
also come to mind.

Should probably be <asm/gpio.h> since not all arches actually have an
asm/arch directory. Nothing wrong with <asm/gpio.h> including
<asm/arch/gpio.h> though...

I think set_output_enable makes more sense, but maybe it's just me.

Definitely.

Yes, it looks to me that most platforms do basically the same thing
with different names.

Handling chips like this would need some rethinking as they can be
added dynamically, so static pin numbers won't do. Handling this could
perhaps complicate the API enough to prevent people from adopting it...

But maybe it could be done as part of the gpio_request() call, if we
specify an additional `flags' parameter? gpio_request() needs to know
about pin configuration anyway, as it needs to set up the pin for gpio.

I'll make a few adjustments to the avr32 api to make it conform with
your proposed api, as well as rename portmux_select_peripheral to
at32_select_peripheral (since it was never really intended to be
platform-independent).
Then I'll send a patch to do the same thing for at91, if Andrew V is ok
with it.

Point taken ;)
