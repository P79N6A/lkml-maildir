I forgot to add that once we have this sorted out we'll do two other things
that you'll like:
a) give you BK URL's that don't change (the current URL's are unstable, they
   are based on revisions and revision numbers are unstable)
b) make every changeset (or range of changesets) be something you can grab
   as a regular diff -Nur style patch.  So all the BK users can post to the
   kernel list and include a URL that you all can wget and there is the 
   patch.  No need to use BK at all unless you want to, the data is right
   there as a patch.
All I'm trying to do is to underscore the point that none of you should "be
nice" and not beat up on bkbits.net.  It's a service, we get at least some
benefit from you using the service so bang on it all you want.  We'll solve
the bandwidth problems.
