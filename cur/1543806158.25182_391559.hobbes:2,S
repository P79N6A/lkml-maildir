I'm not really sure what do you mean by that, but there may be lots of 
reasons for this. Bad bus latencies, other devices blocking the bus, bad 
chipset, bad PCI/DMA controller on the device (this happend to me with 
an AMCC S5933 MatchMaker PCI chip, since it has about 16 HW construction 
bugs within it which makes it nearly impossible to reliably use it with 
any reaonably new chipset - with very old chipsets the bugs didn't 
demonstrate themselfs that much), etc. And you may also consider a hard 
real-time system if it's really time critical and intensive.
