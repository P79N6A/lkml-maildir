  I'm sorry I didn't replied to your mail but I had a bug in my .procmailrc
and mails got sorted to bad folders...
  Yes I agree that if notify_change() blocks we still can account imprecisely.
I think I didn't understand your proposal. The pointers to structures where
quota should be charged are already in inode. And if we count current number
of blocks after notify_change() once more all the quota will be counted
properly. The only problem is that quota can be exceeded this way. We have to check
exceeding before notify_change() because later there is no way to undo what
notify_change() did.
  Currently I'm thinking about change which would make sence to me (at least at
the first sight): notify_change() will call dquot_transfer() (currently
dquot_transfer() calls notify_change()).
