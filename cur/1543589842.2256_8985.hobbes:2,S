You're almost right.  If you counted only explicit constraints, 
created by require statements, you get a bunch of cliques that
aren't that large.
Unfortunately....there are a huge bunch of implicit constraints
created by dependency relationships in the menu tree.  For example,
all SCSI cards are dependents of the SCSI symbol.  Set SCSI to N
and all the card symbols get turned off; set any card symbol to Y or M
and the value of SCSI goes to Y or M correspondingly.
So the way it actually works (I think; I've have to write code to do a
topological analysis to be sure) out is that there's sort of a light
dust of atoms (BSD quota is one of them) surrounding one huge gnarly
menu-tree-shaped clique.
