Maybe.  'cat /proc/cpuinfo' says "cpu family: 6" and "model :4"
(and "stepping: 2").  I possibly misinterpreted that.  Do not believe

Is that important here?  IDE drives in question were not connected to
on-board controller but the Promise one.  Results seem to indicate
that this 'optimal' was important here anyway.

There is at this moment Windows98 installation on /dev/hde1 and it boots
so far.   It got installed and it was booting regardless with these
"other" BIOS seetings.
