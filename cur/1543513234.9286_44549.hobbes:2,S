I do my own distributions and it's me who compile kernels :))  If someone
does compile kernels himself, it's on his own anyway... Any existing
distribution does have it's own set of custom tools and configs so it'd be
not that wise to expect that one can compile his own kernel and this kernel
should work... He could omit his SCSI adapter for example...

May be. But it'd be a bad compatibility...

Let them cry. One can not satisfy every human being...
