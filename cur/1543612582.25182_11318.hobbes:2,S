I've observed disk cache effects with Ext2, the relevant relationship being 
directory entry order vs inode order.  Layout of the index itself doesn't 
seem to matter much because of its small size, and 'popularity', which tends 
to keep it in cache.
Because Ext2 packs multiple entries onto a single inode table block, the 
major effect is not due to lack of readahead but to partially processed inode 
table blocks being evicted.  The easiest thing to do is keep everything 
compact, which it is (dirent: 8 bytes + name, inode: 128 bytes, index: 8 
bytes per ~250 entries).  The next easiest thing is to fix the icache, which 
seems to impose an arbitrary limit regardless of the actual amount of memory 
available.  Beyond that, I have some fancier strategies in mind for making 
processing order correspond better to inode table order by tweaking inode 
allocation policy.  I'll have more to say about that later.  Finally, disk 
cache effects don't show up with HTree until we get into millions of files, 
and even then performance degrades gently, with a worst case that is still 
entirely acceptable.
With ReiserFS we see slowdown due to random access even with small 
directories.  I don't think this is a cache effect.
