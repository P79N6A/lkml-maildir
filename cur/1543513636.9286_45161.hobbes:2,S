Is the fdomain SCSI driver stable for an ISA Future Domain card based upon
the TMC-18C30 chip?  I've been getting periodic crashes from a machine
using this SCSI card.  The deaths seam to occure in the interrupt handler.
The last one ended with a message saying unable to handle kernel paging
request.
