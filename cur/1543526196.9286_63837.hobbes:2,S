Yes, you're right, they're writing good code. But the most important 
part of the job of a good programmer is writing a good documentation 
for other people. This job is disregarded by most of the kernel programmers. 
Its very hard to find actual and good documentation. Look at the KDE 
project, they do a better job. 
I hope the people on this list won't kill me now;)
They are still a standard for me, I afraid I'll never become as good as 
they are. But they are not as perfect as you said. 
Mathias
