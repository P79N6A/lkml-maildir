Here is the result, measured on 8-way profusion.
Andrew posted two paches, so called P1 and P2.
		Req/s
test10-pre5:	2255	bad performance
----
test9+P2:	5243
test10-pre5+P1:	5187
test10-pre5+P2:	5258
P2 may be a little bit better.
----------
Data summary sorted by the performance:
	test8		5287 <-- best performance
	test10-pre5+P2:	5258
	test9+P2:	5243
	test9+mypatch:	5192 <-- a little bit worse
	test10-pre5+P1:	5187
	test1		3702 <-- no good scalability
	test10-pre5:	2255 <-- negative scalability
	test9		2193
The value changes within 30-50 seems fluctuations.
