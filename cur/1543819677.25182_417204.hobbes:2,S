acpi_register_gsi -> mp_register_gsi -> io_apic_set_pci_routing -> assign_irq_vector
acpi_register_gsi is being exported and called from drivers/char/8250_acpi.c.
acpi_register_gsi is also being called from acpi_pci_irq_enable, which in turn is being exported.
There appear to be more (eg through pnpacpi and hpet), but I think these are sufficient.
