OK, I see the code for chmod(1) now:
   if(file is named /dev/whatever) { /* This is _hard_ to find out */
       go update /etc/devices.perms
   }
   else {
       ...
   }
Never thought of that brilliant solution. Just have to fix the obvious race
in there. And think about what to do if /etc/devices.perm is inaccessible
(gone, broken, ...).

Zero kernel impact sound a bell?
