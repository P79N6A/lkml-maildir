Some problems with documentation:
- is a poor substitute for code
  - can never be complete, accurate, or timely enough to match the source
  - <language> is much more ambiguous than C
- encourages bad habits
  - developers substitute docs for readable code
  - people read the documentation and fear the code
  - when people do read the code, they interpret it as suggested by the
    documentation, missing subtle and not so subtle bugs
  - fewer people understand the actual code
- adds more inertia to the interfaces of a system
  - means changes require a greater investment of effort
  - implicitly promises things won't get changed
  - broken designs stay broken longer
- is a lot of work
  - and we've been doing pretty damn well without it
  - and there are good reasons to think it's a hindrance
  - and there are more important/interesting things to do
  - and you don't get very far telling volunteers to do things they don't
    want to 
  - and other people who are motivated in that direction can do it
I think the informal commentary style of things like
Documentation/exceptions.txt is far preferable to any sort of formal
function-by-function docs, inline or otherwise.
