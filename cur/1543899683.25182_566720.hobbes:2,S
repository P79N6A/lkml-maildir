I've frequently wondered why we don't just create more caches for kmalloc:
make it denser than each-power-of-2-plus-a-few-others-in-between.
I assume the tradeoff here is better packing versus having a ridiculous
number of caches.  Is there any other cost?
Because even having 1024 caches wouldn't consume a terrible amount of
memory and I bet it would result in aggregate savings.
Of course, a scheme which creates kmalloc caches on-demand would be better,
but that would kill our compile-time cache selection, I suspect.
