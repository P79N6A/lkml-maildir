Subject: 2.0.29-35 lockup  from PS/2 mouse + IDE access

Not sure if this the the kernel or hardware problem - maybe someone has
already seen it. It happens rather unreproducibly on 2.0.29 and 2.0.35
on the same machine. So here it is:
- There is some IDE HDD activity
- I am running XFree86 ( happened on both 3.3.1 and 3.3.2)
- I right-click a 2-button Microsoft PS/2 mouse
- The system locks up - nothing is responding: keyboard, mouse, ping
from another machine
 This is rather infrequent - maybe once every two weeks, so I can live
with it, and I have not been able to reproduce it at will. I've tried
generating some wild I/O on my HDD, and clicking the mouse, but it
worked just fine.
So my questions are:
 - Has anyone seen this or something similar?
 - Does anyone have an idea of how to reproduce it more reliably?
 - If this is a kernel bug, has it been fixed in 2.2 kernels?
 - If this is some hardware conflict, where do I start looking for
problems?
It appears to be some rare race condition, but I could be very much
wrong. Let me know if you need more info.
