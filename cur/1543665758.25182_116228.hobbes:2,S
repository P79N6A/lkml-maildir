The mask is correct.  The tool not groking it is broken.
In otherwords, the class is only 16bits and it is offset by
8 bits into the class variable in the pci device.  I could
switch to using ~0 and things will probably just work, but
why have a mask at all if it must be "all bits set" in order
for the tools to not complain?
