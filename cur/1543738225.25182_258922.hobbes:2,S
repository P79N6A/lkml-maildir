It's basically impossible to review the patch properly because
of that change. Can you please separate the arbitary white space
change into a different patch? 
Also I would suggest you send the patch to the driver 
maintainers for review first (cc'ed) 
From a quick look the change to clear the ring rx flags completely
instead of clearing the bit looks bogus. Why did you not just add a
endian conversion there?
I can test it when it's properly reviewd.
