it only works if you make a very small syscall-like area which you use
to talk to the "real" kernel. Which is entirely not how linux modules
work right now.... at which point you're just about a userspace
application anyway. Might be an interesting research project of
course...

afaik x86-64 grew segments recently for 64 bit mode for an unnamed other
virtualization vendor
