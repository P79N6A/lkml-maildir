Focussing on -O2 versus -Os is too narrowscoped for the build system.
A much more general solution is needed, without loosing the flexibility
we have today.
For 2.7 I have planned making it possible to modify CFLAGS, and make the
change be effective for all recursive builds.
This could be usefull if for example acpi decides to use -Werror for
all files. One change in one makefile and the desired effect is achieved.
The same infrastructure will be possible to use for -Owhatever.
We sould stick with -O2 for 2.6, lets play with other settings for 2.7.
Router people and others with special needs can finetune it at will in
2.6 - it is one line in the top-level makefile so not a big deal.
