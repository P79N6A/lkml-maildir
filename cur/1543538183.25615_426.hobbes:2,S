Never seen much of that, even with my (by today's standards) undepowered
machines. Sure, I'm not trying to do audio and video while compiling a
kernel and gcc either...
I'm sure there are people out there annoyed by this. So fine, get together
and hire somebody to get this done and donate it to the community. But do
it _right_, not just whine that Ingo's patch _must_ go into the kernel (he
himself said it was a crude hack, remember?).
