The code is related to bd_claim_by_disk which is called when
device-mapper or md tries to mark the underlying devices
for exclusive use and creates symlinks from/to the devices
in sysfs. The patch added error handlings which weren't in
the original code.
I have no idea how it affects ACPI event handling.
Are you using dm and/or md on your machine?
Have you seen any unusual kernel messages or symptoms regarding
dm/md before the ACPI problem occurs?
