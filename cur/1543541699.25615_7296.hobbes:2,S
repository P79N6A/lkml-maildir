That's absolutely horrible.

That's also horrible.
BTW: What do you do if there's a real directory called ".fork"? Or a file?
You also still have the original problem of naming the forks!
If I create "foo" and "bar", both with a fork called "splat", what tree do
I get? This one:
foo
bar
.fork/foo:splat
.fork/bar:splat
(i.e. my idea, but with all the files partially duplicated under magically
created special directories)? This is truly horrible.

It might possibly work, but it would leave a mess on the keyboard. Don't
do it.

It's a horrible mess, and it solves precisely NOTHING - the same problem
remains!
