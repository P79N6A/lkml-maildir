While I agree in general with most of your remarks, I think you're being a 
little too glib here.  Consider my patch to fix group descriptor corruption 
in Ext2, submitted half a dozen times to Linus and other maintainers over the 
course of two years, which was clearly explained, passed scrutiny on 
ext2-devel and lkml, fixed a real problem that really bit people and which 
I'd been running myself over the entire period.  Which one of cleanliness, 
concept, timing or testing did I violate?
If the answer is 'none of the above', then what is wrong with this picture?
