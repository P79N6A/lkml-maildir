Absolutely.  And if /dev/urandom is not unpredictable, that means
someone has broken SHA-1 in a pretty complete way, in which case it's
very likely that most of the users of the randomness are completely
screwed, since they probably depend on SHA-1 (or some other MAC which
is probably in pretty major danger if someone has indeed managed to
crack SHA-1).

Probably.  /dev/random is probably appropriate when you're trying to
get randomness for a long-term RSA/DSA key, but for session key
generation which is what most server boxes will be doing, /dev/urandom
will be just fine.
Of course, then you have the crazies who are doing Monte Carlo
simulations, and then send me mail asking why using /dev/urandom is so
slow, and how can they the reseed /dev/urandom so they can get
repeatable, measureable results on their Monte Carlo sinulations....
