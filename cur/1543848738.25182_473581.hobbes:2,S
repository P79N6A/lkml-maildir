Why do you think it has something to do with VMware's emulation - except 
timing?  From what I see, there were bytes
0xF0 0x83 0x44 0x24 0x00 0x00
before apply_alternatives() was entered (binutils 2.17 would generate 
one byte shorter code, 0xF0 0x83 0x04 0x24 0x00, but that's another 
story - 2.16 and older treat 0(%esp) differently from (%esp)) .  Now 
update alternatives comes in and starts overwritting alternative - note 
that it does that in two steps - first it memcpy()-ies alternative, then 
it memcpy()-ies nop padding.  So after first memcpy() code looks like
0x0F 0xAE 0xE8 0x24 0x00 0x00
Now timer interrupt arrives, and these data are interpreted as
lfence; andb $0,%al; add %cl,0x465B9415(%ebx)
If it would not crash, once it would return 0x24 0x00 0x00 will get 
overwritten with 3 bytes NOP sequence and everybody will be happy.
AFAIT you do not see this because you have to use old binutils to repro 
this - I'm unable to reproduce this on Debian box with binutils 2.17, as 
then byte sequence is valid instruction even if partially overwritten - 
it just clears %al to zero, but nobody notices that...
So as far as I can tell, interrupts (and NMIs?) should be disabled when 
apply_alternatives() run if interrupt handlers are using alternatives - 
and as it was just proven, they do.
Reason you see this happening in VM often is that this first 
alternatives run invalidates lot of internal state, and it takes so long 
that next timer interrupt is for sure pending as soon as first "rep 
movsb" in alternatives finishes.
