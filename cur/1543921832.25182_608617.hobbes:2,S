I like the idea of limiting number of events that client wants to be
delivered to it. I think we need to extend it from keybit only to
event bitmask + keybit. This way, if keyboard has a scrollwheel or a
touchpad installed, HAL can still specify EV_KEY + KEY_XXX and ignore
all REL_* and ABS_* events.
Priority/filter idea is different matter. I don't think it is a giood
solution. There will always be an "arms race", new applications would
like to get in front of the queue all the time and it will be hard to
manage. X should just keep console open in raw mode and simply ignore
all events coming from it while using evdev driver. I understand that
X's hotplug support is getting there so you should be able to switch
to pure evdev setup pretty easy.

Exactly. You can't predict all future uses. There will always be
someone wanting to get in front of the line.

To remove any force-feedback effects installed by client that is being
disconnected.

I think I fixed this.

Input core now has prper locking. You may take device's event_lock to
stop event propagation.
