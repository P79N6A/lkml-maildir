hm, lets figure out why this patch breaks your box, ok? We obviously 
have to revert it if we cannot figure it out, but lets at least try - 
because the patch itself fixes a real regression and it's not obviously 
wrong either. I think there might be some bug hiding somewhere that we 
really want to fix instead of this revert.
Could you try to hack up a debug patch perhaps? Uninline the fucntion(s) 
then add two versions (one is that breaks on your box and one is that 
works on your box) of this same pmd_bad()/pud_bad() functions and do 
something like this (pseudocode):
pmd_bad()
{
	if (pmd_bad_working(x) != pmd_bad_broken(x))
		panic_timeout++;
	return pmd_bad_working(x);
}
i.e. we actually use the working function so your box should boot up 
just fine - but we instrument things with the broken function as well 
and detect the cases where the two values differ. It is an anomaly if 
either function ever returns true instead of false.
if after bootup you have a non-zero panic_timeout then there is a 
material difference somewhere. In that case try to stick a dump_stack() 
into the above case as well - and if the box still boots, send us the 
stackdumps. (if the box doesnt boot then perhaps the printout itself 
hangs - in that case try a save_stack_trace() hack and print it out 
later)
