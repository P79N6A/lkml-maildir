Not for long. It dies shortly afterwards.

I guess having to use PIO with aic7xxx is bad. MMIO failure is
what we need to investigate.

I didn't change anything in that box since it was delivered to me. FYI
it is an IBM x250. Would it help if I can get a PCI space dump and mtrr 
dump ? FWIW, the older driver works fine. Does the older driver use 
only PIO ?
