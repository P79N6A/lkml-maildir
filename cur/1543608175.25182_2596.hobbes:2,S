	I think discussions of copyright issues need more precision
than "your stuff", please.
	The object module resulting from compiling the code fragment
above ("#include ...") might be a derived work of both the code
fragment and the (GPL'd) header file, thus subject to the restrictions
of the GPLv2.  The original source code itself would not be subject to
the GPLv2, because "<sys/types.h>" is not itself a copyrightable
string (although it could be trademarked, of course, which might lead
to the same effect).
	Using, in the non-GPLv2-compliant source file, any symbol name
included from the GPL'd header file, has been commonly assumed not to
taint the source file itself with the restrictions of the GPLv2.  This
is more of a grey area, because the use of these symbols over a block
of code could easily construct a derivation of a usage pattern that
was copyrighted in the interface definition document.
	Usual disclaimer:  I am not a lawyer.
