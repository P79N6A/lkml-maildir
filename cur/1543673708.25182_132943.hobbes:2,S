Hi Greg,
I just learned that withdrawing email once it sent out never work. I posted it yesterday and wonder why it did not post. I then recalled and resend it; as a result, I learned a hard way. Please read the following responses to your questions:
Q: Hm, wierd indenting style, can you just follow Documentation/CodingStyle
and use tabs? 
A: Thank for your suggestion. We will look into the indenting style.
Q: Anyway, what code is supposed to use this function?  A PCI Hotplug
controller driver?  If so, do you have any patches to the current
drivers that show how it is used?
A: We have an engineer to work on PCI Hotplug controller, which calls the API remove_hotplug_vectors. Her name is Dely Sy. She is in the progress of posting her code.
Q: Also, why pass a void *?  That's usually forbidden in the kernel, and
since you are instantly casting it to a struct pci_dev *, why not just
use that? 
A: This is a very good suggestion. We will make change accordingly.
Thanks,
Tom

Even though you are trying to withdraw this message (which is pointless
for something sent to a mailing list), I had a few small questions with
regards to PCI Hotplug devices:
> +/**

> + * argument: device pointer of type struct pci_dev 
> + *
> + * description: used during hotplug removed, from which device is

Oops, your patch wrapped, please try another email client, or change the
configuration options of your current one.
> + * PCI subsystem reclaims associated MSI to unused state, which may be used
>
