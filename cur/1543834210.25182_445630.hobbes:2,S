Overall, the patch looks good.  My quick review finds a couple nits, though:
1) [major] The Intel bridge code ("pci_get_device(0x8086, 0x0370, bus0),
...") is not the type of thing we normally put into a driver.  If there
is a problem with a specific bridge, we would prefer to patch
drivers/pci/quirks.c.
Touching _another_ piece of hardware, other than your own, is a big deal
and generally unwise.
2) [minor] Adding "magic numbers" in stex_hard_reset().  Easy to fix:
convert "0x3e", "0x84", "1 << 5" etc. to named constants.  The named
constants should have sufficiently good names to understand their
purpose, without being overly long C symbols.
3) [minor] For sleeping longer than one second, ssleep() is preferred to
msleep().
4) [minor] 'void *scratch' in struct st_hba tells us nothing about its
usage.  At the very least, a comment, if not a better name, would be good.
5) [agreement/correction]  The block tagging API supports adapter-wide
tags just fine.  HOWEVER, I nonetheless feel that block tagging API use
should be considered post-merge.  The 'stex' driver is working and
tested today.  Since _no individual SCSI driver_ uses the block layer
tagging, it is likely that some instability and core kernel development
will occur, in order to make that work.
All your other changes look good to me.
