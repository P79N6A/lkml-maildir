I suspect the problem is:
CONFIG_M386=y
which makes the support of cmpxchg do complex things.  But it _should_
work.
Still, it makes sense to uninline those ACPI locking functions.  I haven't
yet checked to see if these functions need exporting to modules.
Note that with this patch and your .config, we get
arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.c:91:2: warning: #warning ACPI uses CMPXCHG, i486 and later hardware
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
- Fixes a build problem with CONFIG_M386=y (include file dependenciers get
  messy).
- Share the implementation between x86 and x86_64
- These are too big to inline anyway.
