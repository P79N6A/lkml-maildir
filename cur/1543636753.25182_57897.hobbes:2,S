So does this mean that the item mentioned in the 2.4.19-rc1-ac3 changelog will 
not work because the 2.4.19 base tries to initialize the drive first? Or is 
the -ac tree immune to this problem?
o        Newer SX6000 has PDC20276 chips. Handle this 
If that is the case, I guess I have to use the promise drivers.  However, i'll 
offer free beer if anyone can help me get the i2o driver to work :)
Thanks
