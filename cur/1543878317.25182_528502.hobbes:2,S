Subject: [PATCH 0/5] partitions: Changes to fs/partitions for readability and efficiency
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In addition to the Kconfig help text patch I submitted earlier, this is a 
set of patches to touch up the partition handling files and also to change 
the "array of function pointers" algorithm of the main checking function 
to "list of calls to possible stub functions" to better fit in with the 
rest of the kernel code, to reduce memory usage by a few dozen bytes, and 
to generally be easier (in my opinion) to understand.
