	Right.  As the order of the file names in the diff confirms,
I accidentally submitted a diff in reverse order.  You are also
correct about:
>If this is reversed, you also forgot to change where it is used in
>icside.c.
	Russell: sorry for not cc'ing you in my original patch
submission to Martin.  I infer that since you are adding another patch
of your own and adding Martin to the recipient list that it is OK with
you to volunteer Martin to combine your patch and mine in this case
and submit them to Linus.
	Martin: unless you, Russell, or anyone else sees a problem
with this, could you please also apply the attached patch to icside.c,
which I should have included in my original submission.  I missed my
error when I checked for compiler warnings, because icside is not
built on x86.
