Not true. I don't see anybody designing DAC capable USB or firewire
or sound or TV cards. And there are plenty of non AHCI SATA interfaces too
(often the BIOS defaults are this way because XP doesn't deal
well with AHCI). And video cards generally don't support it 
(although they don't like IOMMUs either). Just these devices all might 
not be performance relevant (except for the video cards)

Your point being? It depends on if the SG hardware is slow
enough that it makes a difference. I found one case where that
was true, but it's unknown how common that is.
Only benchmarks can tell.
Also my results were on a pretty slow IOMMU implementation
so with a fast one it might be different too.

That is something that needs more work.
We should probably have a switch to use the IOMMU only for specific
devices (e.g. for the KVM case) r only when remapping is needed. Only
boot options for this is probably not good enough. But that is something
that can be worked on once everything is in tree.
Also the user interface for X server case needs more work.
