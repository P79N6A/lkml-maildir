thanks Eduardo, i've applied your fixes.
could you perhaps send the missing bits that add the missing 64-bit 
Kconfig entries? Even if the 64-bit side is not functional yet as a real 
guest, it would help us find the build bugs and any runtime regressions 
PARAVIRT might cause on the native 64-bit side of the kernel.
Or is it now just a matter of removing all the depends-on X86_32 bits in 
arch/x86/Kconfig?
