Please raise separate patches for ext3 and ext4 - their paths into the
tree are different.

So we're replacing an accidental for(;;) with something which can
really terminate.  This is potentially a functional change, and it's
perhaps telling us that we should replace it with a real for (;;) loop
anyway.
Plus we still have a local unsigned variable called "i".
Ted, could you please take a look at this sometime, work out the best
course of action?
Thanks.
