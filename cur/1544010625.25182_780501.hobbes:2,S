And this is the past one in my list...
With latest updates (kernel rc8, intel video driver 2.5.1, ...), MTRRs are
setup ok:
one:~# cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0x000000000 (    0MB), size=  512MB, count=1: write-back
reg01: base=0x01f500000 (  501MB), size=    1MB, count=1: uncachable
reg02: base=0x01f600000 (  502MB), size=    2MB, count=1: uncachable
reg03: base=0x01f800000 (  504MB), size=    8MB, count=1: uncachable
But X still has some kind of problem:
[drm] Initialized drm 1.1.0 20060810

Don't know it its a problem, as DRI works and 'gears' (I know, gears is not
a benchmark...) has raised from about 500 in the best times I remember to
750!!.
Perhaps if X could set its MTRR things would be even faster ??
TIA
