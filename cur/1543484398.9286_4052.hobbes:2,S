Actually, I have the 40Mhz part.  The original P70 was a 386/20Mhz, with the
Cx486DRx2/40 upgrade I'm getting the 15.7.  I think this is pretty good for
a 40Mhz box and it feels about like a 486/33 which bogos to about the same.
I didn't know about the bogo.o.  I'll take a look at that.  I will say that
it seems to be totally cosmetic, I can't tell the difference between using
the patch in head.S and using the cyrix utility, with the utility it just
reports wrong in cpuinfo.
Later,
Tom
