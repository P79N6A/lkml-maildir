Also, given that cross-chunk references will be more expensive to fix, I
can imagine the allocation policy for chunkfs will try to avoid this if
possible, further reducing the number of cross-chunk inodes.  I guess it
should be more clear whether the cross-chunk references are due to inode
block references, or because of e.g. directories referencing inodes in
another chunk.
Also, is it considered a cross-chunk reference if a directory entry is
referencing an inode in another group?  Should there be a continuation
inode in the local group, or is the directory entry itself enough?
Cheers, Andreas
