Hello,
I posted an email 1 month ago because I was looking for advices to design
a driver for a lcd device (128x64 pixels) with a t6963c controller.
I have finally choosen a console implementation to interact with the lcd. It
allows me to reuse code that deals with escape character or to start a getty on
it. Unfortunately this implemenatation doens't support lcd's graphical mode.
So I wrote another small driver that can be accessed through "/dev/lcd". It
drives the lcd only in graphical mode. That means that a "echo foo > /dev/lcd"
command won't work as expected.
So now I'm wondering how to synchronize access to the lcd. Because a user appli
that is sending an image to "/dev/lcd" may want to prevent other access from
other application to the lcd either from "/dev/ttyX" or "/dev/lcd" but still
should be able to send char to "/dev/ttyX"
Any idea ?
Thanks for your answers,
         Francis
