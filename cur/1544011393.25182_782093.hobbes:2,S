Well, there are some cases where we don't have ENTRY but do have ENDPROC:
__pabt_usr:
        usr_entry
...
ENTRY(ret_from_exception)
...
ENDPROC(__pabt_usr)
ENDPROC(ret_from_exception)
        .macro  vector_stub, name, mode, correction=0
        .align  5
vector_\name:
...
ENDPROC(vector_\name)
        .endm
Not sure if we have any other oddities.
