My gut feel is that it's pretty safe.  I did run all the LTP ptrace
programs, and the gdb test suite.  (The gdb test suite has failures because
of gdb's own issues and perhaps the state of my gdb build, so I can't be
totally certain that it has zero new complaints, but I am pretty sure it
didn't change the results.)
Thanks,
Roland
