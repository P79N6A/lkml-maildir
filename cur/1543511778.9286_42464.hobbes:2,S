What about ISA cards, pcmcia (or would that come under the fact that these
are isa->pcmcia or pci->pcmcia busses), eisa, vlb, etc?  Esp if it's not x86
arch, say a sparc.  we have the vme bus (I'm curious as to if/when it'll get
supported), sbus.  I'm not sure about the other sparc busses.  Then what do
we do about multi function cards?  I have an sbus scsi/network controller. 
How about cards that take 2 slots.  I have an sbus framebuffer that does
just that.  The only dynamic part in solaris is the fact that the
controllers are on a first come first serve basis (unless there's an order
specified.  Don't take my word for it, I'm not 100% sure, but I'm reasonably
sure).  After the controller on solaris, you have target, lun, slice
(partition).
