I think so too.  I merely moved the code here and didn't notice it in 
all this excitement.
0x00cf9a000xff306600  =>
Present CPL-0 32-bit code segment, base 0x0000ff30, limit 0xf6601 pages, 
for which desc_empty(desc) is true.
Thankfully, this is not used as a security check, but it can falsely 
overwrite TLS segments with carefully chosen base / limits.  I do not 
believe this is an issue in practice, but it is a kernel bug.
Nice catch.  Looks like it affects all 2.6.X kernels.
Chuck Ebbert noticed that the desc_empty macro is incorrect.  Fix it.
