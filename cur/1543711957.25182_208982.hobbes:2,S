You could always merge read/write events if you get too many of them. 
E.g. write [10,11] + write [11,12] => write [10,12]. But I never had 
event buffer overflows with my tests. And a buffer of a few kbytes per 
file system for fam won't be that bad, so I am not sure wether it is 
nessecary to do something as complicated as rate limiting or merging.

You can monitor a whole tree with a single file descriptor. But you need 
at least one open fd per file system, so it would indeed be a problem 
when unmounting.

I had this for a short time, but I threw it away since I wanted to 
concentrate on the event dispatch infrastructure first. It would not be 
a big problem to add this again.
