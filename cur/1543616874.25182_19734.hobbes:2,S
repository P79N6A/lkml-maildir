So there you go, his testing is accurate.  Now we have results that
preempt works and is best and it is still refuted.  Everyone is running
around with these "ll is best" or "preempt sucks throughput" and that is
not true.  Further, with preempt we can improve things cleanly, and I
don't think that necessarily implies priority inversion problems.
