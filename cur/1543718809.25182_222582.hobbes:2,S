:)
One more practical point.
Module maintainers receive patches from various hackers and commit them after 
review with the appropriate "sign-offs" to a subsystem repository.
Subsystem maintainer makes his monthly / whatever upstream update. 
Until now he just reviews the total changes from his last update til now. To 
keep your proposed procedure consistent he would be forced now to go through 
the "trusted" step by step commitments of his module maintainers, extract the 
"sign-offs" and add his own "sign-off" to each single step before pushing the 
improvements upstream. 
IMHO it would suffice for this situation, if the "sign-offs" are tracked in 
the subsystem repository and the subsystem maintainer signs off for the 
overall patch / contribution which is sent upstream.
