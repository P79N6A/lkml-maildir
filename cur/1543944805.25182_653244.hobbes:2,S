When *would* it happen then?  And why not do it as soon as it's
known that the device on the other end of the cable is unsupported?

The device has already been enumerated at this point.  This is just
whether to set up communication with, and use, the device ... which
activity *IS* predicated on device support, "on the TPL" (as it says
in 6.8.1.4 of the spec for the A_HOST role, later reusing that language
where it describes the B_HOST role).

While it makes sense to me that an OTG device support things like
mass storage class devices, I still see that spec language saying
that classes can't be on the TPL ... and that only devices on the
TPL get communication beyond what's needed for enumeration.
Regardless, that's a red herring.  If you allow sane things like
arbitrary flash memory sticks to be used, you've effectively put
a device class on the TPL.  But this discussion is about things
that are NOT on the TPL.

Well, I'm glad at least one person there is talking sanely about
the TPL, but there is no such clarification that I can find.
I've observed USB-IF to be slow to address bugs in their specs,
maybe that's what's going on here.  Bugs are often written into
specs as political compromises, and they can linger for various
reasons.  (Including members with hidden agendas to block success,
and people who prefer to deny inconvenient realities.)

Attaching works, sure.  If you are willing to communicate with
that device, then it's on the Targeted Peripherals List (TPL),
so this code branch doesn't apply.
Put it this way:  there is no *OTHER* mechanism for deciding not
to talk with a device; and that's the entire purpose of the TPL.

I think that detail of the OTG spec is stupid and misguided.
Of *course* it should be possible to support, for example,
devices that weren't shipped before your product's TPL was
defined.  How ever you define the list of Targeted/supported
peripherals, that's got to be able to include classes and
similar mechanisms.  That spec stupidity is one issue;
for the scope of this discussion I'll assume the TPL (which
has an algorithmic check) can pass things like flash sticks.
The other issue is what you call the part of your product
documentation which says what devices it can talk to.  The
only term for such stuff in the OTG spec is "Targeted
Peripherals List".  If you're assuming some other design
abstraction packages that notion, that doesn't match what
the Linux-USB code does.
If you wanted to *add* such an abstraction, you'd have to put
it everywhere the current whitelist is used ... better IMO to
just update the current whitelist/TPL code to handle classes.
Right where the comment says to do it.

There is no such "OTG Clarification" on the website I just
looked at.

That's a patch I wouldn't NAK.  :)
