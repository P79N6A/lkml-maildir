I'm confused.  If B is the default, then we don't need a flag to
enable it, rather we need a flag to go back to the old choice A.
So are you saying that:
 1) Choice A remains the default for the kernel unless
    MPOL_MF_RELATIVE is added, or
 2) that the new default for the kernel is Choice B,
    unless MPOL_MF_RELATIVE is specified, asking to
    revert to the original Choice A behaviour?
Perhaps, either way, whatever compatibility flag we have should be
something that can be forced on an application from the outside,
perhaps as a per-system mode flag in /sys, or a per-cpuset mode flag,
or a per-task operation, by what mechanism is not clear.
