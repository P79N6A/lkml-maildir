AFAIK, the EDX 32-bit register is splitted in two 16-bit halves, being
the least significant half called DX which, at the sime time, is
splitted in two 8-bit halves of which the most significant is called DH,
while the least significant is called DL.
So, DL is not a new register, but the least significant 8-bits from the
EDX CPU register.
