That all suprises me a great deal, although the modes are normally BIOS
selected by the Serverworks and then read by the kernel. CBS5/CSB6 IDE
should be very reliable indeed (OSB4 is a much older chipset and the
problem it has is OSB4 specific)
I'd also suggest you raise it with your RHEL support and/or
bugzilla.redhat.com
