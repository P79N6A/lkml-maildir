You can also deal with memory hotplug by adding a Xen-style
pseudo-physical vs machine address abstraction.  This doesn't help with
making space for contiguous allocations, but it does allow you to move
"physical" pages from one machine page to another if you want to.  The
paravirt ops infrastructure has already appeared in -git, and I'll soon
have patches to allow Xen's paravirtualized mmu mode to work with it,
which is a superset of what would be required to implement movable pages
for hotpluggable memory.
(I don't know if you actually want to consider this approach; I'm just
pointing out that it definitely a bad idea to conflate the two problems
of memory fragmentation and hotplug.)
