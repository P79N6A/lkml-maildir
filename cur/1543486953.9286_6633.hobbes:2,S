I don't think that's true... ln(1) doesn't seem to touch directories, nor
does there seem to be an obvious flag (nor is one documented in the man
page).  UID 0 could call link(2) on a directory, though:
  # mkdir a
  # ls -ld a
  drwxrwxr-x   2 root     other         32 Dec 25 00:59 a
  # ln a b
  ln: a is a directory
  # echo 'main() { link("a","b"); } ' > l.c
  # cc l.c -o l
  # ./l
  # ls -ld a b
  drwxrwxr-x   3 root     other         32 Dec 25 01:05 a
  drwxrwxr-x   3 root     other         32 Dec 25 01:05 b
  # ls -lia a b
  a:
  total 2
    541 drwxrwxr-x   3 root     other         32 Dec 25 01:05 .
    276 drwxrwxrwx   3 bin      bin          240 Dec 25 01:06 ..
  b:
  total 2
    541 drwxrwxr-x   3 root     other         32 Dec 25 01:05 .
    276 drwxrwxrwx   3 bin      bin          240 Dec 25 01:06 ..
