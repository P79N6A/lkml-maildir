Subject: [PATCH 5/7] dmapool: Tidy up includes and add comments
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/4/318

We were missing a copyright statement and license, so add GPLv2, David
Brownell's copyright and my copyright.
The asm/io.h include was superfluous, but we were missing a few other
necessary includes.

+ * This allocator returns small blocks of a given size which are DMA-able by
+ * the given device.  It uses the dma_alloc_coherent page allocator to get
+ * new pages, then splits them up into blocks of the required size.
+ * Many older drivers still have their own code to do this.
+ *
+ * The current design of this allocator is fairly simple.  The pool is
+ * represented by the 'struct dma_pool' which keeps a doubly-linked list of
+ * allocated pages.  Each page in the page_list is split into blocks of at
+ * least 'size' bytes.
