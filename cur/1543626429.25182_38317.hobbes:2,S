The tracesys: label (code) is only used if ptrace is enabled for
the task.  Is it enabled?  If not, you aren't executing this code
at all.
	testb $0x02,tsk_ptrace(%ebx)	# PT_TRACESYS
	jne tracesys
For the register interface, AFAIK, see the gcc docs, such as
Extensions to the C Language Family:
  
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-2.95.3/gcc_4.html
and search for /regparm/ .

regparm (number)
 On the Intel 386, the regparm attribute causes the compiler to pass up
 to number integer arguments in registers EAX, EDX, and ECX instead of
 on the stack. Functions that take a variable number of arguments will
 continue to be passed all of their arguments on the stack.

Someone please correct or add to this.  :)
