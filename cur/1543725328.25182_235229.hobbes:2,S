We put a quick fix in the ppc64 port. If you pre reserve the i8042 region
then the driver will fail to initialise:
        /*
         * Some machines have an unterminated i8042 so check the device
         * tree and reserve the region if it does not appear. Later on
         * the i8042 code will try and reserve this region and fail.
         */
        if (!(i8042 = of_find_node_by_type(NULL, "8042")))
                request_region(I8042_DATA_REG, 16, "reserved (no i8042)");
