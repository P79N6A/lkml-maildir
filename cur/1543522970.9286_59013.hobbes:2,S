yep these two are real bugs. What is the speed impact of your generic
scheduler changes on 'lat_ctx -s 0 2', 'lat_ctx -s 0 100' & similar
scheduler numbers? We do not have to care too much about the case when
1000 processes are running at once. (if we get performance in that area
for free, then ok. If it hurts the simple case then no thanks.)
