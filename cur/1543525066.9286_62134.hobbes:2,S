I have installed Linux RH (6.1)  Kernel 2.2.12.20 
on a x86 box with a Cirrus Logic GD 5480 chipset. 
I can start X but my mouse cursor becomes a blob
of dots of about 1/2 in by 1/2 in. I have recompiled the
kernel and all the modules and I have looked at the
documentation for the Cirrus logic chipsets, the 5480 is
supported and I have not seen any info on such a problem.
Any clues on what could be the problem.....
Thanks
Vijay
