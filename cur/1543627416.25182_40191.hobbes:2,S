the modem doesnt power down. all I get is an oops.
the machine is a k6-ii and is otherwise reliable (even with 100mbit
ethernet).
I've been poking about and have replaced the BUG() with a printk("about to
die!\n"), and return NULL.
I then hardened dl_reverse_done_list so it wouldnt die on receiving a NULL.
this seems to have improved things a LITTLE. I see a few 'about to die's
whizz by, and it stiffs shortly after.
does that help anyone?
