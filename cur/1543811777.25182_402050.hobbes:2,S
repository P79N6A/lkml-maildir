The barrier you're looking for is wmb() in asm/system.h, which is defined 
on both SMP and UP.  On x86 you do not need the sfence as writes will show 
up on the bus in program order, but you do need wmb() to prevent gcc from 
reordering your code.  Adding a new primative only makes things slower as 
the sfence isn't necessary most of the time (it rightly has a dependancy on 
CONFIG_UNORDERED_IO, which the jury is still out on).
