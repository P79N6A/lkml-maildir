It is actually a power rating.  The "ac" on the end denotes the variety of current used by the kernel.  (The normal kernels run on "dc" current.)  The reason that Netscape is scrolling slower is that your power supply is not able to keep up with the power requirements of the new kernel.  Check for a leak in your power cable.
I hope that helps.
