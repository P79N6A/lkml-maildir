Hello everybody. The following extract from
drivers/input/gameport/Config.in doesn't seem quite right to me, in
general and for ARM specifically:
if [ "$CONFIG_GAMEPORT" = "m" ]; then
	define_tristate CONFIG_SOUND_GAMEPORT m
fi
if [ "$CONFIG_GAMEPORT" != "m" ]; then
	define_tristate CONFIG_SOUND_GAMEPORT y
fi
Could the maintainer please change this?
Thanks
Guennadi
