Well I do not see spaghetti in our racks here, and we do have quite a
few. Though we got most of the PCs in these special racks that utilize
the space better when one sticks mini towers in them.

You still have to do your work manually and pipe it through ksymoops
anyway - it seems to me like some people expect all this to be done
for them for free. Free software doesn't not mean zero cost, you
sometimes have to make an effort yourself.
