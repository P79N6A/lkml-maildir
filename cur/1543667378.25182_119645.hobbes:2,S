Hi,
Look at : 
/* Convert from presentation format of an Internet number in buffer
   starting at CP to the binary network format and store result for
   interface type AF in buffer starting at BUF.  */
extern int inet_pton (int __af, __const char *__restrict __cp,
                      void *__restrict __buf) __THROW;
If it doesn't work look in the libc source code :)
regards,
Michael
