I would be very interested in a CSA implementation similar to what I have on
IRIX.  I will also plead guilty to not having downloaded the updated patches
for either the kernel or the tools.  I'm continuing to use my poor hack until
a permanent solution gets accepted into the kernel, at which point I'll
adopt that.
And if it counters the impression at all, I'm not a kernel developer, I
proposed my hack out of need as a user of the tools.  I also try to stay away
from modified kernels, so I'm running Marcelos' 2.4 stable branch with only
the 32bit u/gid_t hack applied.  That's why I haven't had any feedback on the
-mm branch.
In short, for my use BSD accounting is sufficient, but I'd love to see CSA in
Linux as well.  Linux hasn't moved too far into roles where it's a necessity
(for what I'm doing, anyway), but I see CSA as something that would certainly
help it assume those roles.
