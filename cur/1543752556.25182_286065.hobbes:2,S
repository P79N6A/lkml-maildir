Well there is certainly stuff like
 ifdef ARCHX86
  ifndef CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG
   $(error CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG needs to be enabled in the kernel)
  endif
 endif
 and
 ifdef CONFIG_AGP
  ifneq (,$(findstring mga,$(DRM_MODULES)))
   CONFIG_DRM_MGA := m
  endif
 endif
in x11, which makes me very nervous about a blank config.h.
Ho hum...
