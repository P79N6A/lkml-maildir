1. For logging an error message from the driver (Kernel), can I use syslog?
2. Is it possible to use the same function (syslog) from the application 
(user level) to log an error message into the default error file?
3. Where is the location of the error file.
Note: So far I used klogd -f filename option to log my printk messages.
