	Javier is cc'ed.
	While we are on the subject : a few months ago, Javier added
support for MIC to the airo driver. It's basically crypto based on
AES. You refused to include that part in the kernel because crypto was
not accepted in the kernel.
	Fast forward : today we have crypto in the 2.5.X kernel. Does
this mean that you would have no objection accepting a patch from
Javier including the crypto part ?

	By the way, the HostAP driver include crypto (currently only
RC4 for WEP). Same question, I hope you would not refuse the crypto
part of HostAP (which is mandatory because most PrismII firmwares are
broken and can't do basic WEP properly).

	Ok, so I ask it this way : currently the kernel include some
drivers containing some binary firmwares blobs which are linked
directly into the kernel/module (including networking). Does this mean
that you are going to remove those driver from the kernel ASAP ? Or
does this mean that the rule above only apply to wireless drivers ?
	Let's be logical and coherent here...

	Currently, it looks like every driver will use its own method,
which I guess is ok.

	Thanks !
