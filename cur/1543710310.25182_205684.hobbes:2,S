Yep it's should but now in new version it's evil code :-)
Two drivers old and new one just won't listen to append i lilo.conf, even
fbset on old radeonfb mess with consle, demolish resolution to some unsuported
value.
New one is better, just use fbset -a -fb /dev/fb0 -depth 32 1024x768-100 and
you have one small screan i upper left corner off your screan ;-)
Bigger resolutions makes it smeller.
I was writing abaut new radeonfb to Ben, he knows about this. The mess with
old version starts since 2.6.4-rc2-cset103 (when I comple it on gentoo and
slackwe).
