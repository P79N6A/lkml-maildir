hey, it was free.. i was handed an 8bit ISA SCSI card, looks to be powered
by an NCR 53C90A chip... any chance for a Linux driver? It looks like this
chip has drivers in the kernel for MCA, Mac, Sun, Amiga...but none for
plain old PC/ISA, or am I missing something?
If there is none, i'd like to take it on as a project to write the driver
myself (hey, i'm always up for a challenge...not that I have any scsi
devices yet...).. where would be a good place to start? I can probably
take the code for the chip from the other drivers, and then just add the
ISA stuff...any good pointers out there as to how to start? any help would
be appreciated.
FWIW: It boots and says it's an AIC ScuzzieWorks(tm) card, c. 1989-1991.
