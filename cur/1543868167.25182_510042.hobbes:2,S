Hmm, I'm pretty sure I stomped over this (from select_bad_process()):
                /*
                 * This task already has access to memory reserves and is
                 * being killed. Don't allow any other task access to the
                 * memory reserve.
                 *
                 * Note: this may have a chance of deadlock if it gets
                 * blocked waiting for another task which itself is waiting
                 * for memory. Is there a better alternative?
                 */
                if (test_tsk_thread_flag(p, TIF_MEMDIE))
                        return ERR_PTR(-1UL);
Which might explains why the OOM handling was behaving like it did.
It would have been nice if it at least printed "OOM: I'm in a deadlock,
please FIXME...".
