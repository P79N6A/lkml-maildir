    As a small point of technical correctness, AIX has a minimum of
one journal per volume group (collection of physical disks).  Should
the disk containing the journal fail, the other filesystems cannot be
mounted (and currently mounted ones become read-only, iirc) until the
journal is rebuilt.  The data on them is still fully accessable, and
there is no need for recovery/restore.  As soon as a new journal is
replaced, the journal is on-the-fly rebuilt, and away it goes.
    You can, of course, have more than one journal per volume group,
assigning whatever filesystems to each journal as you please.  Ext3
was to support this eventually, iirc again.
    AIX journals can be mirrored just like any AIX logical volume, so
if you are seriously concerned about your journal's disk, mirror it on
a separate disk, or use RAID storage.  I don't know that you can
simply mirror a journal in ext3, but you should certainly be able to
put the filesystem and its associated journal on RAID storage (hardware
or md driver) to provide the integrity you need.
