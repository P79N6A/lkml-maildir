That smells like the known problem in klogd where it dies trying to
process an Oops log.  I always run klogd as "klogd -x" simply because
the standard klogd oops decoder is badly broken.  Change the klogd
start command in /etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog.d to "klogd -x" and restart
klogd.  Or you could apply the last section (ksym.c) of the patch in
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops/v2.3/patch-sysklogd-1-3-31-ksymoops-1.gz
Slightly off topic.  Does anybody maintain klogd and syslogd nowadays?
The maintainer (Dr. Greg Wettstein) changed jobs and I have not seen
anything from him for over a year.  There were rumours of a new log
daemon being written from scratch (syslog-ng?) but distributions are
still shipping old versions of sysklogd, complete with oops decoding
annoyances and bugs.
