Subject: [PATCH: NEW ARCHITECTURE FOR 2.5] support for NCR voyager  343x/345x/4100/51xx architecture
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The NCR voyager architecture is essentially a precursor of the intel APIC one. 
 The Voyager systems support from one to eight "processor" slots which take 
big cards with 1-4 486-686 processors.  The difficulties for linux are mainly 
that the Interrupts are delivered through the VIC architecture of 8 8259 PIC 
dyads (so some processors accept interrupts and some don't); the 8259 dyads 
are accessible only locally to the interrupt handling processor, so global 
interrupt enable and disable becomes a difficult concept.
Since the architecture support depends fairly intimitely on the existing i386 
code, I've slotted it into the i386 architecture directory rather than trying 
to create a separate one.
The architecture was released publicly in March 2001 for both the 2.2 and 2.4 
kernel series.  It has a fairly small user base.
The diffs are ~151k, so I refer to them by URL rather than bunging up the 
mailing list.  The URL is

All comments welcome.
