Not by looking at /proc/meminfo. The fact that Linux redistributes
buffers, etc., during normal operation has often been misconceived
as a memory leak. Linux will try to use all available memory. This
is because unused memory is wasted memory. When Linux first starts
up, there is little to do, and very little history, so it hasn't
gotten a chance to use much memory. If you run a few apps, compile
the kernel, etc., you get to use all the memory. Then when the
system is quiescent, often persons look at /proc/meminfo, note that
a lot of memory is being used, and declare that there must be some
kind of memory leak.
There just might be some kind of memory leak, but, you can't tell
it from looking at /proc/meminfo. You would need to instrument each
procedure that allocates memory and verify that all execution paths,
including exceptions, result in that memory being freed. This would
be a good project for one of the college students that is looking
to get his/her hands dirty. It's a lot more useful than 'inventing'
some new file-system that never gets used, etc.
