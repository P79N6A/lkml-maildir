You can checkout a copy of the code - see www.arm.linux.org.uk/cvs
It basically started out by pulling 65K worth of the duplicated code out
of various serial drivers.  Its currently moving towards allowing the
input layer to talk to serial devices (needed for things like iPAQ
keyboards and IrDA-based keyboards), as well as allowing things like
USB serial devices to use the core code.  Some people would also like
to see a "serial major" where all serial devices live.
