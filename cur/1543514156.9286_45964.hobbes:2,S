Thank you for yours and everyone else's help. The solution which finally worked
for me, (at least I think this is what happened! - I tried lots of things) was
to delete the new partitions using the FreeBSD install program, and then
booting to Linux with a floppy, running fdisk on the appropriate hard drive,
and choosing option o - create a new empty DOS partition table. Sounds pretty
simply, but for a few days, it looked like I wasn't going to be able to use
that hard drive.
Just a warning to anyone on the list who might want to try FreeBSD, when you
are adding the BSD slice, even if you are dedicating a whole hard drive to it,
choose the "keep the drive compatible with other OS" option., or else it does
some odd things with the disk label and partition table.
