Heh. I don't think -rc6 is "possible" - it's "inevitable". We have too 
much fallout from the timer changes still outstanding. It looks people 
finally figured out a big issue with the HPET timer, and that hopefully 
resolves most of the remaining timer-related regressions, but yes, we most 
definitely _will_ have an -rc6.
Andrew, what's your feeling apart from the timer fallout?
