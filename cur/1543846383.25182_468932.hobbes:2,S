yeah, i suspect it works again if you disable:
 CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
 CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
 CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
 CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
as the slowdown has the feeling of a runaway lapic timer irq.
from code review so far we can only see an udelay(10) difference in the 
initialization sequence of the PIT - we'll send a fix for that but i 
dont think that's the cause of the bug.
investigating it.
