 Now, changing that color is simple. Just change the value of TAG_KEY_FG
in scripts/lxdialog/colors.h. Unfortunatelly, this is not a question of
cosmetics, but taste. And I do not want to go into that :-)
 After some browsing around the Menuconfig script and not really
understanding how it works :-), I found the line to change. At least now
the config files look identical when processed with menuconfig (except
the fisrt comment, of course):

 Not sure whether this is worth to put into the next release - maybe
someone can spend two minutes to crosscheck.
