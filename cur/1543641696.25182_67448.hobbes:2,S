It's just an example. Give me real numbers and addresses and I'll show
you configuration with _real_ hardware which might work, but won't
with your approach.

You won't allow windows of the PCI bridge to overlap multiple ranges decoded
by the host bridge - it's a serious limitation, I think.

Nope.  Arch specific pcibios_align_resource is called on every allocation
and should take care of this - read the code.

Actually, no. Some old alphas have several (8, IIRC) PCI memory windows
with a 8Mb "hole" in each.

Pmac firmware is really cool then. ;-) Video cards with 256M memory
regions are quite common and 512M ones already exist.
