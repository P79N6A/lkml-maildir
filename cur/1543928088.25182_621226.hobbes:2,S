The following is a series of patches related to Unionfs.  The main changes
here are bug fixes (mostly discovered using ltp-full-20071031), as well as
full support for splice(2) and swapon(2).
These patches were tested (where appropriate) on Linus's 2.6.24 latest code
(as of v2.6.24-rc3-19-g2ffbb83), MM (mmotm-2007-11-21-16-25), as well as the
backports to 2.6.{23,22,21,20,19,18,9} on ext2/3/4, xfs, reiserfs, nfs2/3/4,
jffs2, ramfs, tmpfs, cramfs, and squashfs (where available).  See
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/
 to download back-ported unionfs code.
