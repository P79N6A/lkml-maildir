Robert, I think what is needed is the changes I sent you for
spinlock.h and system.h.  Could you convert to 2.5 and post?
All, I defined:
local_irq_restore_preempt(x)
local_irq_enable_preempt() 
local_irq_restore_ck_preempt(x)
local_irq_enable_ck_preempt()
The preempt versions are to be used in the spin_unlock_*
macros.  The ck_preempt versions in open code where we do
need to check preemption.  I also redefined:
local_irq_enable()
local_irq_restore(x)
to call _local_irq_* and then test_preempt(x). 
test_preempt() then, if CONFIG_ enables, prints warning
message the first time a test AFTER the irq restore finds a
preemptable condition AND if restore, the interrupt system
is now on.
The net result is that all the code is the same, but we can
now turn on a test to see if there are some preemptions we
are missing.  Usually this would come from turning off
interrupts while wake-up is called.
