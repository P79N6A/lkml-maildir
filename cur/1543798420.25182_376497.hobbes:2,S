My thought would be to generalize the two special cases of writeback  
of dirty pages or dropping of clean pages under memory pressure and  
OOM to be the same general case.  When you are trying to free up  
pages, it may be permissible to drop dirty mbox pages and kill the  
postfix process writing them in order to satisfy allocations for the  
mission-critical database server.  (Or maybe it's the other way  
around).  If a large chunk of the allocated pages have priorities and  
lossless/lossy free functions, then the kernel can be much more  
flexible and configurable about what to do when running low on RAM.
Cheers,
