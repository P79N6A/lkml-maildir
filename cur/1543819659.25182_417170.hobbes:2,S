Ouch, that's gotta hurt plenty.

Did you try pressing Insert(?) on bootup? AFAIR this is supposed to setup
factory defaults on some BIOSes. Maybe there are some other special keys
for certain BIOS versions... (do an internet search, especially for Phoenix
BIOS since many notebooks are Phoenix-based).
But of course the machine may easily be as screwed as not even executing
a single BIOS instruction any more...

Is opening the drive box and connecting to a 2.5" adapter on a desktop
within safe warranty ranges? Perhaps not, but if it is then I'd do it.
