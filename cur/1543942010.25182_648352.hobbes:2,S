I did about 5 complete tests today and dozens of mkfs.ext3's but I
wasn't able to reproduce any of the two errors... very very strange.
(used the same sequence of commands, with and without using the
USB-stick)...
I'll do some other tests tomorrow because these problems were real and I
cannot believe, that they're simply gone...
And IMHO hardware problems are still very unlikely, or am I wrong?
Anyway,.. is there anybody who made deeper tests of dmcrypt? I mean real
massive tests perhaps with different filesystems and so on?
What are your experiences at Redhat?
Best wishes,
Chris
