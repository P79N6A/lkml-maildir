Hi Martin,
Sorry about the slow reply, been away for a bit...

With that blocksize (-blog=9 is 512 byte blocksize) you will have
many more buffer_heads per page than the default (4k; i.e. 1-per-
page) which may cause a different kind of memory pressure to what
you'd otherwise see.
Are you tweaking all the filesystems to use that blocksize?  I'm
not sure they all support that small, actually, for ext2/3 I think
they stop at 1k as the smallest blocksize.
You should find the ideal MD RAID5 XFS geometry to be a 4k sector
size (-s size=4k) and 4K blocksize (-b size=4k) to mkfs.xfs.

Thats interesting, I expect this may be a buffer_head reclaim
issue then, if the larger blocksize runs are completing fine.
In that case, I wonder if the attached patch helps at all?
Can you send me your /proc/meminfo and /proc/slabinfo at the time
you see the failure?  Also the console messages (I guess you sent
to Marcelo earlier too) with these failing allocation messages...

(oh, and also which kernel versions are associated with which
sets of messages - looks like you've tried a few here).

There should be no problems using XFS for everything, including
/boot - I do that on all my systems (for a few years now).

Hmm, that sounds like a device driver bug (if mkfs causes hangs..?).
Could you get sysrq-t or kdb stacktraces for the hung processes?
cheers.
