I've been seeing a lot of complaints about aic7xxx in the 2.4.3 kernel.  I
think that people are missing the crucial point: aic7xxx won't compile if
you patch up from 2.4.2, but if you download the complete 2.4.3 tarball,
it compiles fine.
So, I conclude that the patch was created incorrectly, or that something
changed between cutting the patch and the tarball.
