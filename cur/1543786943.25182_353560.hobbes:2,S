Ah ha.

My colleague Sam observed problems with the e1000 driver in the
2.6.11.4-21.9-smp kernel from Suse 9.3 and also the e1000 driver in
2.6.12-1.1398_FC4smp from Fedora Core 4.  
The problems aren't fully characterized, but AoE ATA read packets
appeared to be getting dropped and/or corrupted.
When using the tg3 driver instead of e1000 the problems went away, and
making the aoe driver alloc_skb with a minimum length of ETH_ZLEN also
made the problems go away.
