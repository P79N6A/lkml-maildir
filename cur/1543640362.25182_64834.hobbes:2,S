When I first read the question I was still thinking in terms of shared
memeory and thought you meant: 'will it destroy the shared memory
segment?'. 
If the question was not related to shared memeory and you meant 'will it
do the same as close() on the file' the answer is yes as well unless the
device driver specifically chose to fail that for some reason (see the
watchdog devices for an example and a reason).
