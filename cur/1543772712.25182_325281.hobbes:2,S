I suggest not speculating about the needs of various RT apps with
respect to the kernel. (your speculation here will add more confusion
to parts of an already confused kernel community) Vendors and other
groups will layer them on as needed depending on specific usage.
The futex/fusyn work is an exception with regard to syscalls, but
don't speculate about projects like that if you haven't been carefully
tracking their progress and their end goals.
That's my suggestion.
