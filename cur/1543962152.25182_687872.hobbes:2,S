good idea :)
one more:
reported bugs sometimes get lost in lkml (or elsewhere) and may not get the attention they need.
maybe there are not enough people who put some steadiness into tracking bugs (i.e. put them in bugzilla and make sure they get tracked/resolved) ?
isn`t that something for kernel-testers, too ?
i`m quite sure that there are people among them who have fun with helping tracking bugs, even if they lack proper programming skills.
imho, it`s not only a matter of knowledge, but maybe manpower, too.
so, wouldn`t it be helpful if there were more people helping the kernel-developers saving time, e.g. by take over the easier tasks like asking bug-reporters for input, help collection of debug-data, help assigning bugs to the right people etc.....

First of all:
I 100% agree with Andrew that our biggest problems are in reviewing code 
and resolving bugs, not in finding bugs (we already have far too many 
unresolved bugs).
But although testing mustn't replace code reviews it is a great help, 
especially for identifying regressions early.
Finding testers should actually be relatively easy since it doesn't 
require much knowledge from the testers.
And it could even solve a second problem:
It could be a way for getting newbies into kernel development.
We actually do only rarely have tasks suitable as janitor tasks for 
newbies, and the results of people who do neither know the kernel
nor know C running checkpatch on files in the kernel have already
been discussed extensively...
I'll try to do this:
- create some Wiki page
- get a mailing list at vger
- point newbies to this mailing list
- tell people there which kernels to test
- figure out and document stuff like how to bisect between -next kernels
- help them to do whatever is required for a proper bug report
