General comment:  diffstat -p1 patch_file
would be a good addition.

And finally, does this change support (or allow) CLOCK_TICK_RATE
to be a variable instead of a #define?
as in include/asm-i386/mach-pc9800/setup_arch_pre.h:
int CLOCK_TICK_RATE;
and include/asm-i386/timex.h:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_PC9800
   extern int CLOCK_TICK_RATE;
More likely (IMO), X86_PC9800 sub-arch will have to be changed
(if it ever works).
