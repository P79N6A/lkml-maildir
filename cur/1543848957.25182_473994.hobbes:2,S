I think it's called the 2MSL wait: there may be TCP segments on the
wire which (in theory) could disrupt new connections which reuse local
and remote port so the ports stay in use for a few minutes. This is
standard TCP behavior but only occurs when connections are improperly
shutdown. Apparently this happens when umounting a tcp NFS mount but
also for a lot of other tcp based RPC (showmount, rpcinfo).  I'm not
sure who's to blame but it might be the rpc functions inside glibc.
I'd switch to NFS over udp if this is problem.
