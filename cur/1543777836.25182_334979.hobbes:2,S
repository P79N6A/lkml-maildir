Sorry, I misread the diff. That are static functions with the variables in 
them, not static structs.
Your patch to arch/sparc64/kernel/ebus.c is broken, the removed and added 
parts do not match in behaviour.
If you add braces after if's please add the '{' in the same line as the if 
itself. This will make the diff bigger, but then this matches 
Documentation/Coding-style.
