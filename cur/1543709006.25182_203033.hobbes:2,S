Apologies to kernel mailing list. This Athlon-64 laptop is available 
here in the UK at quite an attractive price, sold with Windows XP Home, 
so fit for repartitioning as a Linux only box if an empty HD isn't an 
option. I wonder if anyone has Linux up and running on it or any other 
Althon-64 laptop.
Regards
Sid.
