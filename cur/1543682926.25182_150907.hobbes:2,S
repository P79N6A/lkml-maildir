Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.22-pre7 configure help incorrect (i810_rng)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

i went looking for how the i810 rng exported data to the entropy pool
after reading the 2.4 help text, and was confused when i found no code.
this note was in Documentation/i810_rng.txt:
Version 0.9.5:
* Rip out entropy injection via timer.  It never ever
* worked, and a better solution (rngd) is now available.
so the following updates Configure.help to the 2.6 entry:
