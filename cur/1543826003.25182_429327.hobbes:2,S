Hi,
I repeat my question, the required no of pages are available, as shown in
the dump produced by kernel, the request is not fulfilled. Its as follows:
DMA: 106*4kB 11*8kB 5*16kB 3*32kB 2*64kB 1*128kB 0*256kB 0*512kB 0*1024kB =
944kB
Why this is so??
~Abu.

There may be 32 pages available in total, but not 32 contiguous ones -
that's a *lot* of contiguous pages to ask for in kernel space - 128KB
(assuming a 4096 byte page size).
