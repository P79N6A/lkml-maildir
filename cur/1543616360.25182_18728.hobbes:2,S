Here is a test program I would like everybody to try. It is a module
but is not intended to actually be implimented in the kernel as a
module once eveybody finds out that it will reliably cold-start even
a SMP machine. This is for Intel CPUs only.
The purpose of the module is to execute two simple CPU instructions
in kernel mode. This forces a processor reset, just like hitting
the reset button.
There are two scripts that you should look at because you might
want to go to single-user mode first and unmount your disk(s)
if your `kill -1` command kills you as well as everybody else.
I think all the complex reboot stuff in the kernel can be removed
and the simple two-line assembly substituted.
If anybody finds that executing the 'open()' of this test module
does not cause a processor reset in which a cold boot is forced,
please let me know.
Once most everybody has faith that this will produce a clean
reboot, somebody, maybe Allan can use it to replace the reboot
code in the kernel.
The code works by disabling paging while executing code where
there is not a 1:1 physical/virtual page mapping. I have never
found a system, even one with two CPUs that did not instantly
reset.

    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
