Not my call but please keep in mind that once it's in the kernel we
can't go breaking the ABI (well, we might as this is strictly a
debugging mechanism, but still). Anyway, it shouldn't be that hard to
implement and there are plenty of examples in the kernel and you can
always as for help if you hit a brick wall ;-).
