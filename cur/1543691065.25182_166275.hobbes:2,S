My impresion is that much problem comes from the fact that I didn't 
split the patch the first time I sent it.
Most of the oppositon came against the arch/i386/kernel/cpu/{,mtrr/} 
optimizations that are more an eample of how to achive further space 
savings in this scheme but not a required part of this patch.
The main part wasn't non-controversal but it didn't have such a big 
number of opponents.
