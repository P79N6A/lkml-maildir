No the file is created immediately, with the rights it should have. (Normally the rights
inherited from parent.) If the rights do not inherit from parent, so if they are set explicitly,
that right-setting is queued to the list. (Alternatively, these ACLs could be set directly and
the list item which would change the rights can be marked not to change that specific file, but
this is not required.)
