Well, that's one that is not particularly hard to fix.
Either a new set of pda access macros without volatile and memory clobber
can be written, or just get_current can use its own asm, ie.
static inline struct task_struct *get_current(void)
{
	struct task_struct *t;
	asm ("movq %%gs:%c1,%0" : "=r" (t) : "i"(pda_offset(pcurrent)));
	return t;
}
