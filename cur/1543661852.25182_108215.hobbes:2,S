Dear David,
Thanks for your inputs.
Actually i have 8 MB flash and 32 MB RAM in my target board.
I need to create a read-only file system either in flash or RAM 
which should be able to accomodate our application which is about 
8 MB (stripped one).
Thanks again for your response.
with best regards,
Purush
