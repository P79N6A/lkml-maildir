Hello All,
 I am using Linux 2.2.13 on a Compaq Proliant 800 with a Fritz PCI ISDN
Card. I am using Diald to control the link, and ibod to bring up the
second channel when I need 128k instead of just 64k. I am using ipppd
synchronous ppp. I notice that sometimes when the second channel is
swicthed off the ISDN blocks and no traffic flows. Diald seems also
unable to take down the link as well. The only way to set it to work
again is to take down the ISDN subsystem completely and then restart it.
Has anyone else seen this yet? Is it a known problem? It seems to be
slightly more of a problem when the kernel is compiled for UP than for
SMP.
Thanks in advance,
Nicholas Waltham
