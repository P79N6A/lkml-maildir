IMO that should be an arch decision, buried somewhere in arch/x86.
If other arches implement extended config space sanely -- and possibly 
via some arch-specific means that is /not/ mmconfig -- then they should 
be able to make an arch decision that extended PCI config space accesses 
Just Work(tm).
For such arches, pci_enable_ext_cfg_space(pdev) would be a no-op, always 
returning success.
