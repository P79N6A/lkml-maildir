Some patches landed out of order.  In Greg's tree (with Tejun's patches)
`count' is a local variable (not an incoming arg) of type `int'.
So this patch was against Tejun's stuff, not against mainline.
I'd have picked that up, but I went and assumed that it was a victim of the
new dev_dbg() printk arg checking stuff.  Ho hum.
