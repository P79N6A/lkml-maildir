Yes, you need some sort of priority boost to avoid starving unlucky
processes. Tracking a sort of I/O goodness value may help here: if I fire
off a copy of a large file, and a "find /", the former will get much
higher throughput due to large consecutive reads. As it does so, though,
it reduces its own I/O priority; 'eventually' it will be below find, and
find gets some I/O bandwidth.

Hrmm... not quite the system I had in mind. I specifically want to avoid
delaying any requests: when possible, we just pass requests straight to
the drive. The queue of outstanding requests only arises in the first
place when the drive is busy.

Ahh... I see. If we have a large enough backlog of requests that we can't
even elevator sort them fast enough, there's something very odd going
on. Still, I was planning to impose a maximum limit on the backlog - the
question is, what to do when that limit is reached??

LOL! My approach does avoid that, though. As a worst case, the elevator
just doesn't get a chance to sort anything: every request issues hits the
disk directly. If the disk is handling requests fast enough the CPU can't
keep up, we don't really want an elevator anyway...
So, in various scenarios:
* Light I/O - disk handling requests as they are issued. Disk may be idle
at times.
* Medium I/O - small backlog being elevator sorted as needed. Disk active
continuously, but all requests being handled OK.
* Heavy I/O - large backlog building up. Disk continuously active, some
processes may be starved or throttled, depending on priorities.
In the third case, sometimes we WILL want processes starved of I/O. If I
have three processes running - an MP3 player (high priority), a 'find' and
a low priority backup job, I DO want the backup job starved in favour of
the other two.
