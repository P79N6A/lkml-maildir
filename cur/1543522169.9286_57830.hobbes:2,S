I'm afraid there's no new-and-improved way ... (maybe somebody who
remembers why the options were removed can comment ?)
On the other hand, it may be possible to get rid of all the root change
mess altogether (real-root-dev, change_root, /linuxrc), with only a few
comparably small changes to fs/super.c. However, there are some
drawbacks. I'll post my material later today.
