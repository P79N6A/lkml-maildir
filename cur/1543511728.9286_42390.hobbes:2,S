what about the current devfs, but without the filesystem code?
ie a central kernel devfs layer to handle accept driver registrations and
communicate with daemon.
daemon to handle updating the already existing /dev on filesystem?
Would such a solution be acceptable? It seems a decent compromise between
Richards full-blown devfs, and the minimal user-space daemon/scripting
approach favoured by others. Plus we can retain some of the existing devfs
code, and the API it has established.

Paul Jakma.
