Ah. So, er, the DRM<-> userspace protocol is stable, then?
Looks like I was working on bad assumptions (assuming the DRM and X were
tied). I'm not sure where those assumptions came from. Possibly just
that they shared a CVS repo, although I'd hope I'd had more evidence
than that. I realy can't recall.

That's OK, the -RC0 X server actually works better than the 6.8.2 one
for my application, and this gives me an excuse to report some bugs
before 6.9/7.0 is released :)
Thanks for the advice, anyway: I'll certainly bear it in mind in future.
