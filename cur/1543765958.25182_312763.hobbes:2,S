Dear diary, on Tue, Apr 19, 2005 at 10:20:47PM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...

I've made git merge to use read-tree -m, HTH.
I will probably not buy git-export, though. (That is, it is merged, but
I won't make git frontend for it.) My "git export" already does
something different, but more importantly, "git patch" of mine already
does effectively the same thing as you do, just for a single patch; so I
will probably just extend it to do it for an (a,b] range of patches.
