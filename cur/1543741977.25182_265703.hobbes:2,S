This is true for modern x86 architectures.
For some older 386's, where Write-Protect does not work okay, there is a
difference between put_user() and copy_from_user(). put_user() performs an
extra check called verify_write() in addition to checking the address
range. Hence, the following code may be unsafe when running on those
machines.

In older 386's, the kernel will NOT take a fault and write to the
write-protected region.
But then, maybe 386 is too old to worry about :-)
