Hi,
I have writen a small kernel module and it works perfectly, but currently (I 
think it just begun with 2.5.59) I get the warning above when the module is 
inserted. Now I am just interested what I have to change so this message 
won't appear anymore...
Thank you much!
   Thomas Schlichter
P.S.: If my Makefile or source will help I'll give it to you...
