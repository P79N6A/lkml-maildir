I had a very similar problem on a x86_64 up. I got a segfault in init 
with LATENCY_TRACE enabled on 2.6.15-rt2.
I get it at ffffffff8010fe30, which should be mcount according to my 
System.map [1]. It seems a bit weird because i have tried to alter 
mcount somewhat. Initially by removing the initial comparison, but later
i tried a few other things also. Nothing had any effect at all.
AFAIK glibc also has a mcount symbol, and it's almost as if ld.so would 
have linked the glibc mcount symbol to the kernel symbol mcount. That
would naturally lead to a pagefault :)
  And it would be consistent with the fact that statically linked shells
works.
It's probably something completely different, bevause that would be 
really weird. OTOH, it was really weird that i could change the asm for 
mcount in entry.S without any effect whatsoever.
I'll verify that it hasn't gone away in lates 2.6.15-rt tomorrow.
