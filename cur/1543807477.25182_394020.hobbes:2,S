Unfortunately I'd like to open at least one device file after freeze, for a
technical reason that probably does not exist in suspend2, so I need a
temporary filesystem anyway.  Chrooting to it is just a cake.
[BTW, we have the list suspend-devel@lists.sourceforge.net we'd like
to be a place for discussing the userspace suspend issues.  If you could
subscribe to it, we'd be able to move the discussion there.]
Greetings,
