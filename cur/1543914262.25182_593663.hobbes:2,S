Find a kernel-source.*.src.rpm or kernel-*.src.rpm or whatever SuSE uses
for
nameing convention and reverse engineer the .spec file.
Fedora BTW abandoned kernel-source* and they have now a website with a
description
how to produce a configured kernel source tree (e.g. for out-of-tree
modules).

Well, then there must be a .spec file somewhere which just wants to be
extended.

Yes, you put all the steps you do by hand into the .spec file. That's
it.

Actually nowadays usually there no "sym-link updating" anymore necessary

just put the correct ones in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/ and the full name
in
/boot/grub/menu.lst.
