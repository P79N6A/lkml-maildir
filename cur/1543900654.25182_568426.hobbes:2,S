Thanks, greg... Just wondering... If this topic comes up every 6
months or so -seems like there is a "need" for this sort of thing.
Wonder why it has not been implemented yet? Especially if as you say
the system calls are out there already to do it -when you know the
right commands to type in.
Just curious... In my never ending quest to make Linux accessible to the masses
:-)
I'll look up the info and try what you suggested.
