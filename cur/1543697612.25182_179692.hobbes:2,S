Ave people
My redhat 7.3 compiler (gcc 2.96--113) is still complaining about that 
file.
make[1]: `arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      fs/proc/array.o
fs/proc/array.c: In function `proc_pid_stat':
fs/proc/array.c:398: Unrecognizable insn:

fs/proc/array.c:398: confused by earlier errors, bailing out
make[2]: *** [fs/proc/array.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [fs/proc] Error 2
make: *** [fs] Error 2
It's a known error and various patches are floating around on lkml.
Is this
a)a post 2.6.0 item
b)a case of fix the compiler,we ain't gonna work around.
Patching the source is not difficult to do,but it would be nice if 
vanilla 2.6.0 is gonna compile cleanly without patching on redhat 7.3
