Dear linux gurus, 
I have set up a Block Device over a SCSI drive. I write data to the
actual target drive after writing same blocks in my RAMDISK. I am
using RAMDISK of 2 GB. once the allcoated blocks of my RAMDISK are
full i start freeing those blocks (WRITE THROUGH). at  this point i
get this message during Write operations
Ext2 FS- Error: ext2_new_block : Allocating blocks in System zone. <block_nr>
Is this some sort of calculation error or some other configuration problem??
