What happens with Windows is that the Laptop vendor takes the
frozen Windows version available at the time the machine hits the market 
and then tweaks the BIOS and the drivers until everything runs and then
releases the machine.
But if you use newer (or older) W. releases or even service packs or different
drivers on that machine you end up exactly with the same problem.

I think you underestimate the complexity of the problem. Suspend/resume
is a fragile cooperation  of many many different components in the kernel/firmware/hardware
and all of them have to work flawlessly together.  That's hard.
