filename lookup is only lockless for independent files. You end up getting 
the "dentry->d_lock" for a successful lookup in the lookup path, so if you 
have multiple threads looking up the same files (or - MUCH more commonly - 
directories), you're not going to be lockless.
I don't know how we could improve it. I've several times thought that we 
_should_ be able to do the directory lookups under the rcu read lock and 
never touch their d_count or d_lock at all, but the locking against 
directory renaming depends very intimately on d_lock.
It is _possible_ that we should be able to handle it purely with just 
memory ordering rather than depending on d_lock. That would be wonderful.
Of course, we do actually scale pretty damn well already. I'm just saying 
that it's not perfect.
See __d_lookup() for details.
