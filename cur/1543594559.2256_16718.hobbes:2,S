Never mind. We seem to be talking at cross purposes. We both know how
the BKL works and the implications, so there's not much point beating
our heads trying to communicate redundant information :-)

OK, you didn't see what I was driving at. If I had said "if my data is
protected by a semaphore, do I still need the BKL for
vfs_follow_link()" I guess it would have been clearer. Anyway, you've
answered my question, thanks.
