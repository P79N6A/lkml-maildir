So it's when the machine is booting up that you see the problem?  Right, I
was confused for a while -- I thought you meant during the shutdown -r
sequence.
The message just means that when the printer driver _is_ used, it will
poll the printer to see when it's ready, instead of using interrupts to
find out.
Do you have magic-sysrq enabled?  Try Alt-SysRq-P to find out the program
counter, and see where that is in the kernel.
It's more likely that the next driver in line for initialisation is the
one you're having trouble with, but in case it's lp, what parport messages
do you see on boot-up?
Tim.
