Thank you!
So that means the sysenter instruction _does_ exist on the PPro and
early Pentium II, but it isn't usable.
It's safe so long as it is disabled, but as you found, when you enable
and use it, it doesn't work as expected.  (I wonder what the actual
behaviour of sysenter/sysexit are on these CPUs.)
