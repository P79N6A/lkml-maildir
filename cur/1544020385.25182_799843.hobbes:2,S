There's an unspoken reason ;-) The options are ordered by
"strictness", I was experimenting with an API to export the parameter,
in order to move the code to a separate quirk file. Since it's not
relevant in this patch I'll back out the change.

Actually I was considering raising the level to info, it might make
easier to explain to the users why they cannot load their favorite
driver anymore.

Right, it's included indirectly from somewhere...

Ok, will do.
