This means that config space (supposedly set up by the BIOS) reports IRQ 9 
for the device, but the IRQ router really routes it to IRQ 5.

Well, the kernel currently ignores its knowledge about the router and 
trusts the BIOS. Which most likely means that the IRQ won't work.
(Note that in general you should access dev->irq only after calling 
pci_enable_device())

#define DEBUG
in arch/i386/kernel/pci-i386.h will give some debugging output on the next 
boot, which should help.
