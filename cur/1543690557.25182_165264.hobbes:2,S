	So long as it's not an attempt to use the GPL license as a way to restrict
use, there's no problem. There is no license restriction or enforcement
scheme here that one could possibly circumvent because the GPL_ONLY stuff is
not a license enforcement scheme. It cannot be a license enforcement scheme
because there are no license requirements that kick in upon any act other
than distribution.
	The GPL_ONLY stuff does in fact restrict use. However, this is a
restriction anyone is free to remove or circumvent if it bothers them. This
isn't a dishonorable act because nobody intended this mechanism to restrict
use -- I hope.
