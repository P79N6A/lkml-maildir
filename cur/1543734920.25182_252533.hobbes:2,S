Seconded. I just inherited an equally sized patch from another party
and started looking into quilt for this. It doesn't save you from
understanding the patch, but it works wonders reducing the overhead
of doing the split once you know what you want to end up with.
What I'm doing now is keeping the patch files from quilt in the
CVS tree that also contains the patched kernel itself.
