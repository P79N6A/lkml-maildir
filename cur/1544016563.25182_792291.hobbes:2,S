I modprobed the driver before plugging in the cable, so that would explain the 
VBUSVLD bit not being set.

It seems that the ultimate cause for all this strangeness was a mis-wired 
board: the vendor at long last admitted that the VBUS signal is not connected 
in the hardware. Why they didn't simply document this fact, and thereby save 
me a lot of wasted effort, remains a mystery.
As a workaround, they suggested setting bit 0x00000010 in the ctl register, 
which is strangely enough inside the "reserved" space according to the AMD 
data book. Worth a shot, I thought. After hacking up the amd5536udc driver 
even more to do this operation at load time, the register states change to:
cap=0x000083EA
mux=0x00000007
ctl=0x00000193
Seems that a few other "reserved" bits also raised in response. (I still do 
not understand exactly how they wired up the CS5536 IO chip to be different 
from the data book, but oh well.) In this mode, the USB link is finally 
detected, and the board is finally able to enumerate itself as a g_zero 
device.
Please accept my sincere thank-you for your help. I'm hoping that everything 
will work from now on, and that I won't send any more questions your way. :) 
I'll also await an update to the irq stuff in the amd5536udc driver that we 
talked about earlier, if you get around to making the fix for it first.

Yep, that's the one. We're using a USB A-to-B adapter to turn port 3 from an A 
port to a B-port. The standard USB cable uses this adapter.

See how they conveniently forgot to mention UOC in their description, much 
less some magical bit in the ctl register? Tricky, tricky! :)
