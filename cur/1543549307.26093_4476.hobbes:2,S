Hi,
Trying to find out why test9-pre4 freezes with mmap002
I added a counter for try_again loops.
... __alloc_pages(...)
        int direct_reclaim = 0;
        unsigned int gfp_mask = zonelist->gfp_mask;
        struct page * page = NULL;
+       int try_again_loops = 0;
- - -
+         printk("VM: sync kswapd (direct_reclaim: %d) try_again #
%d\n",
+                direct_reclaim, ++try_again_loops);
                        wakeup_kswapd(1);
                        goto try_again;
Result was surprising:
  direct_reclaim was 1.
  try_again_loops did never stop increasing (note: it is not static,
  and should restart from zero after each success)
Why does this happen?
a) kswapd did not succeed in freeing a suitable page?
b) __alloc_pages did not succeed in grabbing the page?
