It fails :-)
The symptoms vary. Sometimes it just doesnt work.
Sometimes it causes a kernel hang.
On all machines I have access to hwclock works.
But there are sufficiently many reports of "hwclock" failing
and "hwclock --directisa" succeeding (especially on more
obscure alpha versions, but not only on alpha) to leave
the directisa option for the moment.
