i'd like to add the following to the list of reasons as well: the 
current -hrt patch-queue (high resolution timers, which enables true 
microsecond-level resolution for POSIX timers and nanosleep()), which is 
working pretty well in the -rt tree and implements an important feature 
for Linux, is based on the generic timekeeping subsystem as well.
