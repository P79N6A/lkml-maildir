Sorry for delayed response.
I'm assuming the you board is configured with the PXA as a SPI master
and the chip you are talking to is the slave (part number of the slave
chip would be helpful).  Which SSP port are you trying to use?

The master determines when the data is valid by asserting the slave chip
select.

Yes, but setup by the board init code.

I do not believe this can happen when the PXA is in master mode and the
chip is a slave.

The PXA SPI master setup only generates a spi data clock when there is
data in the tx fifo thus to read you must write first even if you only
send zeros. The SSP port can be setup to use a free running clock but
this leads to coordination problems with the chip select and is a
limited use when the PXA is the SPI master.  To make this work you will
need to allow the SSP to manage the chip select, see the PXA
documentation.
I would strongly recommend attaching a logic analyzer to the SSP port
you are trying to get working.

See above. Must write to read.

I never found any documentation on the net, usually the data-sheet for
the chip you are talking to specifies the SPI requirements (master,
slave, clocks, chip selects, etc). Can you send me a link to the chip?
