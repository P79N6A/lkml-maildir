Oh. Yes, tmpfs might just about explain it:
58320	/tmp
So it looks like I have a swap-free box for a time. I guess I'd better
be careful... :)

Yes, I expect so. It must've gone negative really rather early: and note
that it's some distance below 2^64 by now, so it's still falling.  If I
wait for a billion years or so it might wrap around. :)
