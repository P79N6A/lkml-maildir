One thing that really irritates me about the bkbits.com page (unless I
missed figuring out how to so this) is that you can't seem to be able
to pull down the plain text version of a source file. The only thing
it will give you is a vile HTML'ified version which adds about 15
chars/line with naming and which has all tab's converted into spaces.
Any chance you'd add this?
