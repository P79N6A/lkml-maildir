Hard to tell, with OOO engine and decoder constraints. But once again it
is in the out of mainline code path for odd buffer addresses, not in the
loop, so its performance is not critical. Actually code size may have more
impact it ends up spanning one more cache line (or even a 16 byte block
used as fetch unit by P6 cores).

The one instruction that you can still be moved around easily is the
pointer increment. But I would never try to improve code paths that I
consider non critical.
