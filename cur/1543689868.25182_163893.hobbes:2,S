I have try the latest binutils 2.13.1 with no success.
With this version, thoses two lines in the Makefile seems to be mutaly
exclusive:
STATIC := -Wl,-Bstatic
DYNAMIC := -Wl,-Bdynamic
After installing binutils 2.9.5.0.22, it links and work.
Thank you for your support: i've got my oops decoded :)
regards,
j.
