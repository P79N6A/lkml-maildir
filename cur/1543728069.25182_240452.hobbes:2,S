Sorry for being incomplete, but XFree86 cannot find both of them (/dev/psaux 
and /dev/input/mice) when compiled as module
I compiled it in the kernel and now detection is fine.
But using my PS2 mouse is still problematic. It just goes after some time wild 
and jumps back and forth.
Dmesg reports:
psmouse.c mouse out of sync, throwing away 1 (or 2 / 3) bytes
When I disable the IRQ Thread for the mouse it works normal again. Any ideas 
what the problem could be?
Thanks,
Remon
