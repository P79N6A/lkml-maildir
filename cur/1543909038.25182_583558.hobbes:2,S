I have actually been using Steven's patchset to do my work, but in a
way it's a tool. Moving things out of the way in bulk and see whats
missing kinda helps for that :)

That works - alternatively we could build two modules, lg and lg_<arch>
and just have lg pull in the arch one as well? I'm not really biased,
but I think it will get messy later once we add ia64 and x86_64 to the
directory.
