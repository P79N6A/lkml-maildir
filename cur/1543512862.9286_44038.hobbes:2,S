I have kernel 2.3.20.
There is a problem with ppp.
The PPP support, ppp support for async serial ports and ppp deflate
compression I build into the kernel.
 BSD compression I made as a module.
When I try open to open kppp, it wrotes this message:
This kernel has no PPP support, neither compiled in nor via kernel
module loader.
But when I start pppd in terminal, I can open kppp or wvdial (while is
pppd still running).
What's wrong?
I'm using ppp-2.3.10.
I made it with:
./configure
./make 
./make install
Did I anything wrong?
