More on this problem -- here's someting weird.  If I wait a few seconds
after typing 'chmod 444 *' on a directory of files, then I start seeing
write_inode() come through the vfs, however, if I do an 'ls -l' on the
directory immediately after I issue a chmod command, then the
write_inode() never seems to happen.  It looks like write_inode() is
getting called by some sort of delayed process (who writes dirty inodes
back to disk).  The changes don't show up changed right away after a
chmod call either.
I think I'll just implement notify_change() since the vfs.txt
information about relying on notify_change() to default to write_inode()
is obviously incorrect -- there's a hole somewhere where the inode
permissions can get lost.
