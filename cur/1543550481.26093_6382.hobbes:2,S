I think you misunderstand...  there are many ways for Linux drivers to
communicate between one another.  There is no one standard way, because
no one standard way can cover all situations.
You must describe -what- is being communicated, -how much- data is being
communicated, and -how often- communication occurs before we can help
suggest a method of driver<->driver communication.
In other words, the method of driver communication is part of your
design, not a piece of existing kernel API.
