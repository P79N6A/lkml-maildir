What about kernels that use devfs? To open the device,
devfs would need to have already created the device
node, and this must surely happen when the module
loads. Can devfs create a node without claiming any
resources?
For reference, I use devfs, and have a DVD-ROM (hdc)
and a CD burner (hdd). The DVD uses ide-cd and the
burner uses ide-scsi, and I have to preload ide-cd
(with the "ignore=hdd" parameter) so that ide-scsi
doesn't grab the DVD.
