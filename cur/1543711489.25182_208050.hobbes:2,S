I agree this optimization will cover the common case, that's a nice
improvement compared to the old patches.
still this doesn't solve the mremap of a shared cow region (not a direct
one), how is that solved in Hugh's current patch? Is he implementing
Linus's suggested unsharing? I don't see it implemented so I wonder how
can he swap those regions. Is that like an mlock right now?

I don't need a tree for the swapping efficiently with anon_vma (not even
the rbtree lookup with find_vma). I believe in practice anon_vma is the
most efficient design for swapping anonymous memory. If Martin can show
anon_vma slower than anonmm (in the non-swap case of SDAT bench) then I
can change my mind about it, at the moment I believe it'll not be
slower.
Also you're not going to share the same prio_tree code for the anonmm
and the inode, there's no meaningful vm_pgoff in the anonmm design.
As for the parts Hugh's claims sharable, I much prefer my
implementation, he also still leaves some PG_anon outside the
PG_map_lock, I'm quite confortable with my implementation being rock
solid, I find it simpler too (i.e. absolutely nothing to do in mremap).
I also run lots of regression tests already, the only pending bug is
Jens's device driver bug in ->nopage, that I'm asking about on l-k for
confirmation.
