Bill said that he uses SLES10/ia64, so the version of libcap is different
from Fedora Core's one. 'libcap-1.92-499.4.src.rpm' is bandled.
Then, I found a strange code in libcap-1.92-499.4.src.rpm.
The setfcaps calls cap_from_text() which is defined in libcap to parse
the command line argument. It has the following function call chains:
cap_from_text()
   -> cap_init()
     -> _libcap_establish_api()
---- the definition of _libcap_establish_api() ----
void _libcap_establish_api(void)
{
     struct __user_cap_header_struct ch;
     struct __user_cap_data_struct cs;
     if (_libcap_kernel_version) { <-- _libcap_kernel_version is 0 initially.
         _cap_debug("already identified kernal api 0x%.8x",
                    _libcap_kernel_version);
         return;
     }
     memset(&ch, 0, sizeof(ch));
     memset(&cs, 0, sizeof(cs));
     (void) capget(&ch, &cs);  <-- (?)
     switch (ch.version) {
     case 0x19980330:
         _libcap_kernel_version = 0x19980330;
         _libcap_kernel_features = CAP_FEATURE_PROC;
         break;
     case 0x19990414:
         _libcap_kernel_version = 0x19990414;
         _libcap_kernel_features = CAP_FEATURE_PROC|CAP_FEATURE_FILE;
         break;
     default:
         _libcap_kernel_version = 0x00000000;
         _libcap_kernel_features = 0x00000000;
     }
     _cap_debug("version: %x, features: %x\n",
                _libcap_kernel_version, _libcap_kernel_features);
}
---------------------------------------------------
capget() is called from _libcap_establish_api() with full-zeroed
__user_cap_header_struct object at first time.
The result of this, sys_capget() in kernel will return -EINVAL.
(Why did strace say the first argument is 0x19980330?)
Probably, Bill didn't update libcap.so.
But I can't recommend Bill to update libcap immediately.
As Hawk Xu said, it may cause a serious problem on the distro
except Fedora Core 6. :(
I have to recommend to use 'fscaps-1.0-kg.i386.rpm' now.
It includes the implementation of interaction between application and xattr.
(Of couse, it's one of the features which should be provided by libcap.)
Thanks,
