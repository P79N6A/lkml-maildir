With the checker tool, which we suggested in the initial proposal, it is
possible to verify
 * that every marked message has a description
 * that there are no descriptions without corresponding messages
 * that format strings of message and description match
So when compiling the kernel using C=1, you will at least see warnings,
when a message has changed or a message disappeared:
>> make modules C=1
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/utsrelease.h
  CHECK   drivers/kmsgtest/kmsgtest.c
drivers/kmsgtest/kmsgtest.c: Missing description for: kmsgtest.1
drivers/kmsgtest/kmsgtest.c: Description without message for: kmsgtest.3
