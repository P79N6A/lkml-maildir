The status of this patch is HOLD, and has been for months.
AFAICS this is a behavior change that differs from other Becker-derived 
drivers.  I would suggest looking at other drivers.
Furthermore, people should be using ethtool to set media.  Rather than 
changing the behavior of this module parameter to be non-standard, I 
feel it is better to (a) leave it as is or (b) remove it completely.
