Try running the script below after exposing hiwater_vm via
/proc/pid/status as "VmPeak:" (see my other mail in this thread).
========
#!/bin/sh
for f in /proc/*/status
do
	awk '
		BEGIN{ state = 0; }
		/^Name:/	{ name = $2;	++state; }
		/^Pid:/		{ pid = $2;	++state; }
		/^VmPeak:/	{ x = $2;	++state; }
		/^VmSize:/	{ y = $2;	++state; }
		END{ if (state == 4 && x < y)
			printf("pid %d (%s): %d < %d\n", pid, name, x, y);
		}
	    ' <$f
done
========
On 2.6.12.2 it prints:
pid 13170 (sh): 3312 < 3336
pid 16621 (sh): 2916 < 2996
pid 1696 (getty): 1576 < 1580
pid 2338 (getty): 1576 < 1580
pid 2344 (getty): 1444 < 1580
pid 24497 (getty): 1576 < 1580
pid 27929 (knews.sh): 2984 < 2988
pid 6207 (rsh-title): 1156 < 2980
pid 6208 (rsh): 1952 < 2036
pid 16749 (awk): 1836 < 2368
On 2.6.13 it is much worse.
