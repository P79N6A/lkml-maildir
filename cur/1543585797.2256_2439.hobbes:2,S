And that's an argument I can buy, too.  I'll restore the TOO prefix
in my change list.

Actually, that's not what I did.  One of the principal PPC maintainers
agreed to get the PPC numeric-prefix symbols (9 of the 20) cleaned up,
but dropped the ball.  I waited on this as long as I thought I could.

The workarounds would be slow, or ugly, or both.  As I said -- I might
have gone with them, but there since had to be a fix patch anyway, and
I had buy-in for all but 11 of the 39 changes...

According to the National Crime Survey administered by the Bureau of
the Census and the National Institute of Justice, it was found that
only 12 percent of those who use a gun to resist assault are injured,
as are 17 percent of those who use a gun to resist robbery. These
percentages are 27 and 25 percent, respectively, if they passively
comply with the felon's demands. Three times as many were injured if
they used other means of resistance.
