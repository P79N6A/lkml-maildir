Indeed, until all(!) relevant apps specify the cooperative O_EXCL flag,
there will always be some trouble left somewhere...
And of course don't even dare trying to do a simply shell cat on the raw
I/O device during an ongoing burning operation, will you!?
Maybe it's better to (additionally?) go down the route of fixing up
low-level communication weaknesses (since it's been semi-confirmed that it's
an USB communication issue, see other thread part).
IMHO this is a severe user experience issue that shouldn't be fixed up
("covered", "hidden") by the O_EXCL thingy alone.
