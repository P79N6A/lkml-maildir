Hello,
Sorry if this is not the right place for this
question.
I need to increase the maximum number of fds
from 1024 to 4096 per process.
I changed:
fs.h: changed INR_OPEN from 1024 to 4096
limits.h: changed NR_OPEN from 1024 to 4096
My application now works as expected, but the
system performance has decreased somewhat.
My question is, how do my changes affect the
kernel? should I consider using more but less
powerful servers instead of concentrating the
load in one single server?
Thank you
