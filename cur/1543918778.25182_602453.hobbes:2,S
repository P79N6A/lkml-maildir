Miscompilation can do about anything. There have been a number of other
reports about compiler issues lately. Ingo Molnar here:

The trend I am seeing is that we are optimizing for, and testing with,
recent compilers (gcc 4.1 and later) and that older compilers tend to
break, even though compilers as old as gcc 3.2 are still supposed to be
supported. Not good.
