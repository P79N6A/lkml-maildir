Hi!
  Plan 9 Resource Sharing Support (9P2000) (Experimental) (NET_9P)
[N/m/y/?] (NEW) ?
If you say Y here, you will get experimental support for
Plan 9 resource sharing via the 9P2000 protocol.
See <
http://v9fs.sf.net
> for more information.
If unsure, say N.
What is "plan 9 resource sharing"? Some kind of mosix-like process
migration? Could you explain it in two lines in Kconfig?
http://v9fs.sf.net
is redirect to 
http://v9fs.sourceforge.net/
which tells me 
Moved to SWiK
after clicking on that, I get to page with content, but no
explanation (could Kconfig/MAINTAINERS be updated?).
 								Pavel
