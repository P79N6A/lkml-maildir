But we already covered that?  Your exciser can do an unconditional
end_page_writeback(), because it is this thread of control which did the
set_page_writeback().  So we end up with:
	end_page_writeback(page);
	lock_page(page);
	wait_on_page_writeback(page);

Well someone needs to be taught all about this case.  Question is, should
it be the VFS, or should it just be the address_space(s) which brought
this state about, and which care about it?
