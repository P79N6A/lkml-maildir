That's cool.
The interesting part for some people would be, if I read past postings
correctly, to change the inode ratio in an existing (perhaps even
mounted) file system without losing data.
(I'm not sure how many blocks have to be moved and/or changed for that
purpose, because I know too little about the on-disk ext2 layout, but
since block relocating is already in place for shrink support in the
offline resizer, some of the work appears to be done already.)
