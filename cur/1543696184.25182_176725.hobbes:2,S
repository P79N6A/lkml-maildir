IMHO this is too much clutter.  Just make it mandatory for the
architectures to define their own MAX_NR_MEMBLKS in the numa case.
Or actually even better just have a 
#ifndef MAX_NR_MEMBLKS
#define MAX_NR_MEMBLKS	1
#endif
in the generic code and let every architecture that wants to override
it do so.
