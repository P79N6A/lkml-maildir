Hi,
	These times when I switch to the console pressing any keyboard key can
result in mad random console switching. This behaviour has been
consistant for 4-6 kernels, with random mixings of -pre, -aa -ac and
freeswan (of course this might be some king of hardware problem on my
box, but I can work in X all days without fearing random effects).
	Now at long last the kernel decided to blurp a big fat oops in /var/log
messages, so I decided to decode it and send it here. Attached is a
tar.bz2 with the system's .config, the decoded oops and output of dmesg.
Since the files are a bit fat I decided not to spam the list with
clear-text versions.
Kind regards,
