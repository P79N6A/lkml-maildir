Hmmm. Ok. e1000 only uses kmalloc_node which is based on 
kmem_cache_alloc_node. However, kmalloc_node will likely become a 
macro like kmalloc.
Applying the patch would mean that modules would only be 
able to use kmalloc_node and not able to allocate node specific memory 
from one of the slab caches.
