Actually, we (IBM) do have a simple API to do this that Matt Dobson 
has been working on that's nearing readiness (& publication). I've 
been coding up a patch to _alloc_pages today that has both a strict 
and non-strict binding in it. It first goes through your "preferred" set of 
nodes (defined on a per-process basis), then again looking for any 
node that you've not strictly banned from the list - I hope that's 
sufficient for what you're discussing? I'll try to publish my part tommorow, 
definitely this week - it'll be easy to see how it works in conjunction with 
the API, though the rest of the API might be a little longer before arrival ....
Martin.
