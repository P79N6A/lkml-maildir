Have you actually looked at it and how huge pages are implemented
on the various architectures ?
Honestly, I don't think we have any common abstraction on things
like hugepte's etc... actually, archs aren't even required to use
PTEs at all.
I don't see how we can make that code arch-neutral, at least not
without a major redesign of the whole large pages mecanism.
