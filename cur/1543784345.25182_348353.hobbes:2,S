Sometimes.  They're mistakes.

The number of times I've been made aware of it happening is quite occasional.

Maintainer is (at least) cc'ed when the patch goes into -mm and when it
goes over to Linus.  Post-facto complaining is appreciated, so we can fix
the kernel and so I can tweak the process or the brain.

It shouldn't be necessary to complain more than once.  Sometimes I'll hang
on to a complained-about patch a) to remember that something needs to
happen and b) because an update is expected.  Once or twice I've
accidentally submitted such patches.
This particular patch ([SERIAL]: Avoid 'statement with no effect'
warnings.) didn't ever go into -mm.
