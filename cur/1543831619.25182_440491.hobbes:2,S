The 'writing dirty from the tail of inactive list' is asynchronous
writing and it is not applicable for throttling.

I am not sure what "sense" is being referred to. Some file systems do
allocate a lot of memory in ->writepages().
ext3 is still in the same ball-park as ext2.

pdflush is throttled through blk_congestion_wait(), but it is not
throttled by writing dirty from the tail of inactive list, while
scanning for memory. This destroys LRU ordering.
