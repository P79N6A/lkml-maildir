AFAICT the only way we can see that is if we kick the same ones twice.
Using max_cpus= the exact number of cpus you have or CONFIG_NR_CPUS=
the exact number of cpus you have will get testers able to boot until
it's fixed.
It shouldn't be too hard to find the faulty code; all 5 "Genuine"
entries are bogus and alias the entries we actually want (the Xeons).
