Seems like the object owner should also change when the object moves
from one container to another.

I think the ability to move file backed memory from one container to
another is useful.  This allows appropriate containers to get charged
based on the usage pattern.  Though this (movement between containers)
is not something that should be encouraged.

hmm, would it not be better to have a thread each in two different
containers for handling different kind of requests.  Or if there is too
much of sharing between threads, then setting the individual priority
should help.

Any resource movement between containers should be at best efforts.  The
stats will tend to be more inaccurate (which I think is okay) as the
sharing between resources across increases.

Well, for a set of processes that are sharing a set of resources
perfectly, it would be okay to combine all such resources in a single
container.  But for a shared resource, like file(that spans across
processes in different containers), it could be useful to have a
stand-alone container.
