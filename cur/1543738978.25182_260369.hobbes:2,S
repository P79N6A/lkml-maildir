It looks like memory corruption somewhere. I suspect not directly related to NUMA,
but the different memory layout with NUMA may trigger it.
I would enable CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB and CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and see if that
triggers it elsewhere.
First suspection would be the device driver. Perhaps you can test it with
a different block device?
