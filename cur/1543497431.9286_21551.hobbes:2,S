I was chatting with tchrist (the perl guy) today and he mentioned that 
BSD does a better job of very large directory handling than Linux.  The
suggested test was to create a directory with 10,000 files in it and
compare
	ls -l
	ls -l first_file
	ls -l middle_file
	ls -l last_file
under both BSD and Linux.
Has anyone done this?  If this is an area where we need some work, I'll 
add the appropriate test to lmbench.
