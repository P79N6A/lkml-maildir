That seems rather stupid. Perhaps installing a conditional handler before 
doing anything with MSI will solve that problem... The problem then just 
revolves around replacing the conditional handler with the real one when MSI 
is fully enabled. If I understood the code for this driver better I'd try to 
make this work. As it stands I'm still trying to recover from the loss of the 
work I did on another project. (DRM based uniform kernel graphics interface - 
had a blackout here that caused my devel machine to crash and left me with a 
trashed drive)
