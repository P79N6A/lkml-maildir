Yeah, I could, I just don't use USB enough.  My suspend script is now stripped 
down to the point where the only thing I do is run dhclient afterwards (and 
that's mostly because it seems to be too stupid to notice the timeout's 
elapsed.  Persumably it should have some kind of trigger if the wireless 
access point toggles...)
It's just that a hot-pluggable bus, it should be possible to convince the 
thing to reprobe all devices on a bus reset.  Oh well.
Maybe a todo item for 2.7...
