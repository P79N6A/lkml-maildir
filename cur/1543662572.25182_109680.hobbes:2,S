IIRC, the semantics of smp_call_function() are to call the function on
all other cpus.  So shouldn't this be
	return smp_call_function_on_cpu(func, info, wait, cpu_online_map & ~(1<<smp_processor_id()));
?
Also, maybe you were planning to do this in a future patch, but
shouldn't smp_call_function() be moved to non-arch-specific code, given
this change?
