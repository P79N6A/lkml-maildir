 You are unfortunately mistaken -- the spec is explicit about *local* APIC 
IDs having to start at 0.  There are at least two places in the spec that 
refer to that.

 You can always assign 0, 16, 17, etc. to local APICs and then 1, 2, 3, 
etc. for I/O APICs.  Frankly I don't know what the actual justification 
behind the requirement is.  Note that the ID of 0 need not necessarily 
belong to the BSP.
