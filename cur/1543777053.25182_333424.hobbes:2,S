Yes, now relayfs and KProbes this two diffrent stories without 
strict relation but this relation exist on higher level. Both are used 
for solve tha same problems (for measure, watch, some skeleton debug).
Collecting data _without_ dynamically hanged probes requires relayfes but 
if collected data can be rolled to data types what you will want to see as 
result of experiment (i.e. number of calls of some code asociated with 
differnt stack path or number of I/O operation asociated with avarange 
transfered data in I/O operations) sucking result data will not be an 
issue :)

Of course yes. I want only say: if KProbes will have this logic relayfs 
will not be neccessary and instead focusing on develop and merge relayfs
better will be spend time on prepare code for this additional logic 
(and probably neccesasary amount of code will be compareable to current 
relayfs code size :)
