 No, no, no, that would be insane, no doubt.

 I meant something explicit like that:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG8B
	if (!cpu_has_cx8)
		panic("Kernel compiled for Pentium+, requires CMPXCHG8B
		      feature!");
#endif
An oops would be quite an obscure response for a configuration error.  As
I stated, just look into check_config(), for how it's done in similar
cases.

 No need to break what works, either.
