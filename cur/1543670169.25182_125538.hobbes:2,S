Take a look at 6.3.3 "Per-process namespaces"
[-- snip --]
"BUGS: The program mount does not know about this feature yet, so
updates /etc/mtab. Reality is visible in /proc/mounts. Some kernel
versions have a bug that would cause the new process to have a strange
working directory. Probably that is avoided if this is started with a
working directory / or so - not in some mounted filesystem."
I found symlinking /etc/mtab to /proc/self/mounts (or /proc/mounts,
mhich is a symlink to /proc/self/mounts) solved the mount bug.
HTH
