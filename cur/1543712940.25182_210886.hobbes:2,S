For both fsync and O_SYNC, the pages we want to write synchronously are
also available for some other part of the kernel to write async.  Since
we do know the write is going to be O_SYNC when we are marking the pages
dirty, we could mark them dirty_fua or something as well.
Even assuming we can deal with the data=ordered ext3/reiserfs issues, it
makes the writeback for O_SYNC yet another corner case to check, and one
where we have no useful way to make sure the fua bit really got set on
all the writes for a given O_SYNC (unless we pin the page and check each
one after the writes are complete).
Since O_DIRECT is much less complex I think we should start there.
