At an aside...  This may be useful.  Or not.
Al Viro had an interesting idea about kernel<->userspace data passing 
interfaces.  He had suggested creating a task-specific filesystem 
derived from ramfs.  Through the normal VFS/VM codepaths, the user can 
easily create [subject to resource/priv checks] a buffer that is locked 
into the pagecache.  Using mmap, read, write, whatever they prefer. 
Derive from tmpfs, and the buffers are swappable.
Then it would be a simple matter to associate a file stored in 
"keventfs" with a ring buffer guaranteed to be pagecache-friendly.
Heck, that might make zero-copy easier in some cases, too.  And using a 
filesystem would mean that you could do all this without adding 
syscalls, by using special (poll-able!) files in the filesystem for 
control and notification purposes.
