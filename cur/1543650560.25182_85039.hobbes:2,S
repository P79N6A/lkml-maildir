I'd say six of one, half-dozen of the other.  I've been working with another
engineer on updated patches that among other things make NUMA work on Alpha
again.  We're also re-working much of the surrounding code, including much of
this file anyway - Marvel uses a much different topology than Wildfire.
It looks fine to me, but realistically the only opinion I can give for real is
a shoulder shrug, as I'm not exactly sure when the code will be ready for
submission.  Actually, the patch looks just like a part of the patch we have
working, just without Marvel support.  Then again, I suppose IBM would have a
hard time doing that, huh? ;)
