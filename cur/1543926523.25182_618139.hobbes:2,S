I might quarrel with some details, but I really like the general notion.
I think we can use this to pass per-syscall syslet data to the
scheduler.  Today the patches have submission syscalls which basically
wrap some data for the scheduler around the syscall ABI.  This might
save the syslet patches from needing to know about each arch's ABI.
We'll see.  I'll give it a try.
