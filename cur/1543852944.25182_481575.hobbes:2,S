I would like to know when the Intel people working on the ipw2200 will merge 
1.2.0 into vanilla? If it's not in vanilla is this present in akpm's -mm 
tree?
The version in vanilla right now doesn't work with WPA and doesn't work with 
the newst firmware.  
Are there plans to change the ipw cards to use the new softmac subsystem? 
Thanks,
Shawn.
