What would be preferrable instead of dropping UID when privleged
services are needed?  more specifically I need
    * CAP_NET_RAW (bindtodevice)
     * CAP_SYS_NICE (setscheduler)
     * CAP_IPC_LOCK (mlockall)
I had thought about adding the correct code to get these capabilities
but it still requires a start-from-uid0 environment
THanks
