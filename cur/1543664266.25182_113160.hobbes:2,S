Journalling saves you from data loss due to abrupt power off.
No filesystem will ever save you from silent data corruption
due to failing hardware or from bugs in filesystem code itself.

IIRC this can happen if your gcc is in non-standard location.
Curiously, it will work just fine for 99,9% of other source packages,
but not the kernel.
Instead of playing with makefiles I got away with:
GCC_EXEC_PREFIX=/path/to/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib make ....
