Interesting. This is the '0xff' code sent by the keyboard (meaning "I'm
confused, someone pressed too many keys or is banging on me way too
quickly - I don't guarantee to send all keypresses or keyreleases
anymore") and is interpreted incorrectly by atkbd.c.
It should spew a different message ("Too many keys pressed") to your
console. 
If you can, please enable debugging for i8042, using
	echo -n 1 > /sys/module/i8042/parameters/debug
then try to reproduce it, and send your 'dmesg' to me.
