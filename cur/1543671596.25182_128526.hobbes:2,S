What is this EIO report. The CPU is never returned to user space apps, 
so the app never sees any error.
As for retries, for DVD playing we do not want the Linux kernel to do 
any retries, because during DVD playback, we just want a very quick 
response saying there was an error. The DVD playing application can then 
skip forward 0.5 seconds and continue. If one sector fails on a DVD, 
there is little or not point in reading the next sector. One has to 
start reading from the next VOBU. (i.e. about 0.5 seconds skip.)
Cheers
