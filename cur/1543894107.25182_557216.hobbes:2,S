They're waiting for the commands they issued to complete.  ata_aux is
trying to revalidate the scsi device after libata EH finished waking up
the port and hibernate is trying to resume scsi disk device.  ata_aux is
issuing either TEST UNIT READY or START STOP.  hibernate is issuing
START STOP.
This can be caused by one of the followings.
1. SCSI EH thread (ATA EH runs off it) for the SCSI device hasn't
finished yet.  All commands are deferred while EH is in progress.
2. request_queue is stuck - somehow somebody forgot to kick the queue at
some point.
3. command is stuck somewhere in SCSI/ATA land.
#1 doesn't seem to be the case as all scsi_eh threads seems idle.  I'm
looking at the code but can't find anything which could cause #2 or #3.
 Also, these code paths are traveled really frequently.
I'm also trying to reproduce the problem here with xfs over RAID-6 array
but haven't been successful yet.
David, do you store the hibernation image on the RAID-6 array?  Can you
post the captured kernel log when it locks up?
