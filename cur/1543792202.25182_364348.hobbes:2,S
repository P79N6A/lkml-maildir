The pthreads standard specifies that the default behaviour is that new 
threads should be created with the SCHED_OTHER policy and a priority of 0.
However, it appears that the kernel will create new tasks (be they 
threads or processes) with the same settings as the parent.
If CLONE_THREAD is set, should the kernel perhaps set the policy and 
priority as specified by pthreads?
