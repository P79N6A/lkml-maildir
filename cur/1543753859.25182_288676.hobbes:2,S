Enable CPU_FREQ_DEBUG and activate it.
Thanks,
Venki
config CPU_FREQ_DEBUG
        bool "Enable CPUfreq debugging"
        depends on CPU_FREQ
        help
          Say Y here to enable CPUfreq subsystem (including drivers)
          debugging. You will need to activate it via the kernel
          command line by passing
             cpufreq.debug=<value>
          To get <value>, add
               1 to activate CPUfreq core debugging,
               2 to activate CPUfreq drivers debugging, and
               4 to activate CPUfreq governor debugging
