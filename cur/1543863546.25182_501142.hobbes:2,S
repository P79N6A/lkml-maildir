My code is fairly stable and reviewed, for a couple months .. It also
goes on -mm without this new high res/dynamic tick patches.. So you
could accept that set while HRT stabilizes, and gets merged with my
stuff. I wouldn't be pushing for my changes to go into 2.6.20 , but I
think they could.
There is more collision from parts of my patch set which haven't been
submitted to you. It's the clocksource->flags introduction in this new
high res/dynamic tick patch set. I'd NAK those just because I'm not
convinced they're well thought out, and since they make changes to
several arch clocksources reverting them later wouldn't be to fun.

I haven't review it all either, but I was rather surprised to see such
extensive changes this late. The -mm version was getting pretty mature
too..
