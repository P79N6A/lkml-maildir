I have no time to work on the kernel.  You keep forgetting that
non-kernel related work also takes a tiny little bit of time to
perform.

Nobody talks about a complete sysconf implementation.  Only one which
exposese the kernel parameters.  The libc will add the rest.

Of course.  Just recently I needed the real value of NGROUPS_MA.  How
should I get it?  Also, fpathconf() is needed.  And no, I'm not
misdirecting this.  Their were in the past some tries to implement
this and you ignored them.
