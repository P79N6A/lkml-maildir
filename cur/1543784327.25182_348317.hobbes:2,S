Well, it appears that we're fast approaching meltdown in kernel
land - patches are being applied despite maintainers objection,
maintainers are not being copied with changes in their area, etc.
I might mind less with the occasional slip up if it was occasional,
but it doesn't appear to be anymore - maybe not from my perspective.
This morning Andi Kleen stated:
 "normally he (akpm) asks you before finally sending them off -
  then you can complain again"
I don't appear to be asked by akpm - patches from -mm are sent
to Linus CC'd me, and that occurs during the night.  Come the
morning, they're in Linus tree so unless one is awake reading
email 24 hours a day, it's impossible to "complain again".
Is there a concerted effort to maintainers?  It certainly seems
so from my perspective.
