For x86-64  the new code seems far more complicated than the old one and keeps
the same information in two places now. I have my doubts that is really a 
improvement over the old state.
I think it would be better if you just defined some simple "library functions"
that can be called from the architecture specific code instead of adding
all this new high level code.
