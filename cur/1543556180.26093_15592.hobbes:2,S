The first case (y and m) would be satisifed by
   M_OBJS := $(filter-out $(O_OBJS) $(L_OBJS), $(obj-m))
but the second (y and y) wouldn't.  If you want to be allowed to
mention a .o file twice, and still maintain ordering, you are asking a lot.
You could try:
obj-$(CONFIG_FOO)$(CONFIG_BAR) += foobar.o
obj-$(CONFIG_FOO) += foo.o foobar.o
obj-$(CONFIG_BAR) += bar.o foobar.o
O_OBJS := $(obj-y) $(obj-ym) $(obj-my)
M_OBJS := $(obj-m) $(obj-mm)
But that it starting to look ugly.
Maybe:
O_OBJS := $(shell echo $(obj-y) | tr ' ' '\n' | cat -n | sort -u +1 | sort -n | cut -f2)
But I don't think that is much better.
There is room for other good ideas here if this is a real need.
