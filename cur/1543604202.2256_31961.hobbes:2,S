What if the CPU does divide its time into two 1/2 parts, and gives one
each to xmms and dbench.  Everything runs fine, since xmms needs 1/2 cpu
to play without skips.
Now dbench (or any task) is in kernel space for too long.  The CPU time
xmms needs will of course still be given, but _too late_.  Its just not
a cpu resource problem, its a timing problem.  xmms needs x units of CPU
every y units of time.  Just getting the x whenever is not enough.
With preempt-kernel patch, the long-lasting kernel space activity dbench
is engaged in won't hog the CPU until it completes.  When xmms is ready
(time y arrives), the scheduler will yield the CPU.
