I hope, Al could find some time again.

We can, but it will be unreliable:
Typical proc entry creation sequence is
	pde = create_proc_entry(...);
	if (pde)
		pde->owner = THIS_MODULE;
Right after create_proc_entry() ->owner is NULL, so try_module_get()
won't do anything, but proc_delete_inode() could put module which was
never getted.
This should fixable by always setting ->owner before proc entry is
glued to proc entries tree. Something like this:
	#define create_proc_entry(...) __create_proc_entry(..., THIS_MODULE)
However, I think it's not enough: delete_module(2) first waits for
refcount becoming zero, only then calls modules's exit function which
starts removing proc entries. In between, proc entries are accessible
and fully-functional, so try_module_get() can again get module and
module_put(pde->owner) can happen AFTER module dissapears.
What will it put?
And how can you fix that? The only way I know is to REMOVE ->owner
completely, once we agree on this pde_users/pde_unload_lock stuff.

Probably, you're right and they are independently fixable. It's all
about following 3 lines after all. My turn to hmm...

OK. Should I send incremental updates or full patch again?
