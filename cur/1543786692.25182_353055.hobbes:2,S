I'm now looking at this, but you've done an error. You say that 
You must create the snapshot-origin device before you can create snapshots.
This is totally wrong. The whole point of my document is to show that you can 
create snapshots *WITHOUT* having a snapshot-origin device (yes, I did it).
And while the LVM setup (with snapshot-origin) is often used and well known, 
the possibility to do without the snapshot-origin, and more important to 
write on the snapshots, is something which is not widely known at all.
In fact, UML community has been using an in-house version of the same feature, 
which cannot be mounted on the host due to missing code.

Not yet had time to look at those, sorry.

If you feel like doing this, ok, but I'm not normally a documentor.
