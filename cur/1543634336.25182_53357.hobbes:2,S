I wouldn't draw _any_ conclusions about either patch yet, because as you 
said, it's only one type of load.  And it was a single tick in vmstat 
where page_launder() was aggressive that made the difference between the 
two.  In a different test, where I had actually *used* more of the 
application pages instead of simply closing most of the applications 
(save one, the memory hog), the results are likely to have been very 
different.  
I think that Rik's right: this simply points out that page_launder(), at 
least in its interaction with 2.5, needs some tuning.  I think both 
approaches look very promising, but each for different reasons.
