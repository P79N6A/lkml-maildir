We (OLPC) are the only ones using this driver, as we are the only ones with
this hardware.  Marvell designed the cafe for us, and it is not available
on the market yet.  Backwards compatibility at this point is not a concern.

We're building the driver in statically; there's no point for us to make
it a module.  We could add a kernel argument, yes, but that quickly
becomes unwieldy as we require more and more.  We've actually been trying
to cut down the number of kernel args we use.
That said, I'm not opposed to keeping the parameter name the same while
making the default 1; I just thought that the name 'alloc_bufs_at_read' was
clearer.  Another option is to change it to 'no_alloc_bufs_at_load'.  Jon,
any preference there?
