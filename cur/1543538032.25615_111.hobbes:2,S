What about interactive playback when a key is responding to velocity ?
That's the core of the issue and certainly isn't the 5ms delay BS you
said earlier.

Audio programmers aren't *dipshits*, of course they know this stuff and
neural network noise reduction, adaptive signal processing, complex math,
etc...

The above that you've outlined is the core of the issue. This can be done
either using soft or hard realtime factilities. It's realtime [soft/hard] DSP hell
and fudge around the problem using typical Unix time sharing concepts
misses the point[s] completely.
All the previous stuff about buffering is largely useless to this
discussion. Everybody including their little sister[s] know about data
buffering N seconds before the audio hardware output.
