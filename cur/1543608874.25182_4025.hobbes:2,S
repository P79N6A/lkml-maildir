Look, Linus.  Things should _not_ happen this way.
Why do we add non-trivial changes when going from last -preX of a test kernel
series to -final?
Please make the last stable -preX the -final _without_ any changes.  This is
the third time this caused problem in recent times (2.4.11-dontuse, parport
compile problems and now loop.o), and why don't we learn from previous
mistakes?
Isn't it stupid that some tarballs in the /pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/ do not even
compile, while those in /pub/linux/kernel/testing/ does?
Regards,
Anuradha
