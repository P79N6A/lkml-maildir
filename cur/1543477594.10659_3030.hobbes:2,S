When I buy cards, I get combo cards.  My home network is coax,
but I'll pick up a hub sometime.  Locally, I have 2 machines
connected almost always, and sometimes 3 - of my own.  Also,
quite often, some people bring a box over for multiplayer games,
or to surf the web in tandem and do research - so I often have at
least 1 to 2 machines here that are not mine that are left here
at any given point in time.  Most people I know also have combo
cards.  Anyone buying a single card, I tell to get a combo card
so that they can connect to any network easily - also because
mine is the one they'll most likely be connected to.
I have enough coax to handle 5 machines here, and if necessary,
I'd get more.  Usually if someone is bringing a bunch of machines
over for a "lan party" as you describe (we call it a Quake-fest -
even if we're not playing Quake) someone allready *HAS* a hub,
and they bring it over.  I've got tonnes of CAT5 cable, and We
usually end up with an 8 or 16 port brought over so there is no
problem.  I've got enough coax for 5 machines, and I've got at
least 5 10base2 cards to go around if we needed to swap.
I'd love to get a hub, and likely will soon, but can't afford it
right now.  Coax is cheap, works good for *me*.  I've not had any
trouble with the coax yet.  If someone CAN afford a hub for their
network, then I say get it, and don't bother with coax.  I still
see coax as a very cheap home network solution though.
