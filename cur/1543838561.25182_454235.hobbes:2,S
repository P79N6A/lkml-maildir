Right now we don't even have the node stored in the pci_dev structure but
only arch-specific accessor functions/macros.  We could change those to
take a struct device instead and make them return -1 for everything non-pci
as we already do in architectures that don't support those helpers.  -1
means 'any node' for all common allocators.
