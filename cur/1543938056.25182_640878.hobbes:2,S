According to GNU grep we have two CONFIG_LGUEST_GUEST variables (sic), 
one in arch/x86/lguest/Kconfig and one in drivers/lguest/Kconfig.
And CONFIG_LGUEST (which selects CONFIG_LGUEST_GUEST) is in 
drivers/lguest/Kconfig which gets included from drivers/kvm/Kconfig (sic)
which in turn gets included from drivers/Kconfig which in turn is not 
within the "if PARAVIRT_GUEST".
Rusty, don't blame randconfig for finding bugs in this mess you 
created...
