Hi all,
<p>i'm experiencing a very annoying problem with the server that is the
<br>file server for my company ( i'm trying to make them believe in Linux
<br>but some people are starting to laugh :-( )
<p>It's an AMD K6-2 400 on an epox motherboard, 128MB RAM , IBM IDE HDD
,
<br>AHA 2940 SCSCI card on which i've plugged a IOMEGA JAZ and an intel
<br>ehterexpress pro 100 NIC card.
<p>since the beginnig ( kernel 2.2.x ) i've been experiencing a lot of
<br>random system hangs ( no messages on the console or in the log files
).
<br>The only way after such a hang is to do a hard reset.
<br>I know some other people have been experiencing the problem and i've
<br>also seen on kernel traffic ( <A HREF="
http://www.kt.opensrc.org/">http
://www.kt.opensrc.org/</A> ) that Alan
Cox
<br>found some interesting problems in the inode_truncate functions.
<br>>From the 2.2.10 patch, it seems that some changes have been made to
this
<br>part of the kernel but for me, it made things WORSE: i had two hangs
in
<br>less than 24h while before ( kernel 2.2.9 and below ) the system could
<br>stay up for a few days.
<p>I've been running the same kernels on different systems and never had
<br>the problem. It seems to be really specific to this machine.
<br>It is sometime loaded ( a few users, a CVS server, a samba server for
8
<br>Windoze machines,&nbsp; and an http server running mod_jserv and mod_ssl
)
<p>If you need more information regarding my configuration, please feel
<br>free to email me, i'll be happy to help pinpoint the problem !
<p>Thansk for your help/advices
