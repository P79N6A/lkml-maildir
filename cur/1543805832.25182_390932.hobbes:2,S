OK.  But isn't the core of the problem the fact that __alloc_percpu() is
using kmalloc_node() rather than a (new, as-yet-unimplemented)
kmalloc_cpu()?  kmalloc_cpu() wouldn't need the L1 cache alignment.
It might be worth creating just a small number of per-cpu slabs (4-byte,
8-byte).  A kmalloc_cpu() would just need a per-cpu array of
kmem_cache_t*'s and it'd internally use kmalloc_node(cpu_to_node), no?
Or we could just give __alloc_percpu() a custom, hand-rolled,
not-cacheline-padded sizeof(long) slab per CPU and use that if (size ==
sizeof(long)).  Or something.
