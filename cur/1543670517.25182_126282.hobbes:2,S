I hate asking this on top of the work you already provide, but would it
be possible to allow rsync access to the repo itself? I have atleast 6
computers on my LAN where I keep source trees (2.4 and 2.5), and it
would be much less b/w on my metered T1 and on your link aswell if I
could rsync one main "mirror" of the cvs repo and then point all my
machines at it.
I do a lot of diff'ing and log reading, so it would help out there too
if I didn't have to connect back to bkbits to perform those frequent
operations.
No biggy if not.
