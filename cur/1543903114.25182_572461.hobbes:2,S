Subject: [PATCH] [7/11] i386: Do not include other cpus' interrupt 0 in nmi_watchdog
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/20/227

From: Keith Owens <kaos@ocs.com.au>
kstat_irqs(0) includes the count of interrupt 0 from all cpus, not just
the current cpu.  The updated interrupt 0 on other cpus can stop the
nmi_watchdog from tripping, so only include the current cpu's int 0.
