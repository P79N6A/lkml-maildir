Oh boy.  Do we really want to add all this stuff to JBD just for
drop_caches which is a silly root-only broken-in-22-other-ways thing?
Michael, might your convert-inode-lists-to-tree patches eliminate the need
for taking inode_lock in drop_pagecache_sb()?  Probably not, as it uses an
rbtree.  It would have been possible if it was using a radix-tree, I
suspect..

I suspect the code would end up simpler if __journal_unfile_buffer() were
to take an additional ref on the bh which it placed at *dirty_bh.
Callers of __journal_unfile_buffer() could then call
void handle_dirty_bh(struct buffer_head *bh)
{
	if (bh) {
		jbd_mark_buffer_dirty(bh);
		put_bh(bh);
	}
}
?
