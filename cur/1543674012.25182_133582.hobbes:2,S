So all firmware has to be permanently in RAM anyway?

How or precisely, how do you know that it gets it when it needs
it? Are you planning to have a gray area where the kernel generates
a special user space before everything else gets woken?

How? You cannot page out memory during resumption.
You must not cause any access to disk during resumption.

No, still no good. It means that you get a memory leak if you unload
a driver before firmware is provided. You need the ability to explicitely
cancel a request for firmware.

Not with that interface.
You'd need drivers to register both with their subsystem and
a firmware subsystem. But you cannot make device discovery
wait for user space.
You'd have to rewrite the probe method of all drivers that need
firmware.
