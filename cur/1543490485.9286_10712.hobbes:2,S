Ahem... How does it matter? If the iput() in question doesn't drive
i_count into 0 the code in question isn't executed at all. If you are
giving up the last reference *and* nlink is zero - the thing will be
removed from hash, ->delete_inode() will be called and unless it will
rehash the sucker (which it shouldn't and doesn't) clear_inode() will be
called and inode will got to freelist. Code in question not executed
again.
	The only cases when it may be executed and be *not* a no-op:
a) delete_inode() decides to link the sucker somewhere instead of killing
it for good and rehashes it. Will work *only* if the inode will be also
made clean. Doesn't look right for me, besides nobody actually tries to
pull such stunts.
b) inode we've called is clean, hashed and not on the main list (and we
gave up the last in-core reference). In this case we transfer it to the
main list. Not to mention the fact that it can never happen (AFAICS) it
sounds really odd.

It would be *wrong* (and mostly pointless) on normal filesystems and it
can be trivially checked on any fs, anyway, so...
