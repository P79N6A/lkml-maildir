Hi Andrew,
I have updated the autofs4 patchset inline with the discussion 
the other day regarding my changes to sys_chdir and sys_chroot.
I tested against 2.6.5-mm6.
The patches are, as usual at: 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/raven/autofs4-2.6/2.6.4
Changes:
- pushed the chdir and chroot handling to revalidate and
  removed redundant code. Hughs' patch is now not needed.
- Added code to set sub_version field in super block info
  struct that was omitted from original patches.
Basically, patch 5 has changed with 6 and 7 being redone to take account 
of line number changes.
Ian
