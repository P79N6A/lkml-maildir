Subject: i386: gcc & asm(): wrong constraint for "mull"

Hello,
I noticed (with some inspiration from Andy Kleen) that some asm() 
instructions for the ia32 use the "g" constraint for "mull", where my 
Intel 386 Assembly Language Manual suggests the "MUL" instruction needs 
an r/m operand. So I guess the correct constraint is "rm" in gcc, and 
not "g". That change identical assembly output for gcc-2.95.2, but some 
gcc-2.96.x will try a multiplication with an immediate (constant) 
operand for the "g" constarint, and the as will choke on that.
(Redhat 7.0 ships such a version of gcc).
As I won't be online next week, let me say
regards and a good new year to all!
Ulrich
