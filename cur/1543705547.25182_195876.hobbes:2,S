Oh, never use this udevsend in any script. It expects the SEQNUM from
the kernel, not a random one from you! You will always get timeouts
everytime you use your own SEQNUM, like the timeout after the start of udevd.
If you really need udevsend, I can't imagine for what case, we need to
add some logic to it, to bypass the event ordering and waiting to put
the event straight to the exec_queue.
