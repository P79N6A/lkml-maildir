hi,
Can anybody tell me how sigevent notification for SIGEV_THREAD is 
implemented in linux.
According to POSIX,
for SIGEV_NONE , do nothing.
for SIGEV_SIGNAL, sent signal (sigev_signo).
but i have no idea what to do for SIGEV_THREAD.
POSIX tells that a notification function should be called. How is it 
implemented?where?
I am learning Posix signals and Timers.
thanks in advance.
