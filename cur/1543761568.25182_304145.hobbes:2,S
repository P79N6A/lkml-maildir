This error is reported by the drive itself, indicating uncorrectable 
errors when attempting to read data from the media. It is quite unlikely 
that the controller or driver is responsible for this sort of error, as 
can occasionally be the case for DMA timeout errors. Almost certainly 
the hard drive is failing.
