If you read my message closely then you should have understand that 
setting the request highr *didn't* help, ie
echo "max_kb_per_request:128" > /proc/ide/hde/settings
made *no* difference, so I won't even try that patch. As far I have 
understood this is exactly the thing you changed in the patch. If I am 
mistaken, then I take it back.
