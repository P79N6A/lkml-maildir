	Well, it seems that the CDROM fs driver is broken in 2.2.7-ac2, when I 
make a mount /cdrom the kernel informs me about a disk change and it 
mounts normally but when I go to /cdrom and try for example an "ls" I get 
a strange error (don't remember it now exactly) and nothing happens (that 
is, I get no directory listing), as it seems to be some kind of typo I 
think more people would complain about it, if not, please email me, I 
will recompile it and make all kind of tests for you :-)
