It looks ok now that it doesn't do it for host controllers. I guess we 
could just apply it.

That piece of unbelievable crap? Have I ever said anything negative about 
something that shitty? I can't imagine having ever badmouthed such a 
mindless and totally broken piece of sh*t hardware/firmware interface.

Arjan swears he'll have a patch for me to only use mmconfig when actually 
appropriate by 2.6.25. In the meantime, the BAR disable is probably worth 
trying.
But the disk errors are something else, doesn't ring a bell. Sounds like 
IO corruption on the group descriptor block or something like that. Might 
be worth testing to see if the problem goes away with less than 4GB of 
RAM..
