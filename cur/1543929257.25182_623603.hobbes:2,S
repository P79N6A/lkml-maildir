One measure to kernel quality is to recover well from IO errors
(like network problems or broken block devices)
This patch will likely work against that by breaking error paths.

Any distribution aimed at end users cannot ship with it on. 
Most likely not even a standard Linus kernel should really enable
it without warnings.
Also in general I have my doubts that the false positive:real bug
ratio of this warning is well balanced. Just consider the original
example of dead network servers. Even in my relatively small
home network that that is a quite common occurrence. This patch
will break that all by throwing random backtraces when this 
happens.
