But the VSID is something like 20 bits, no? So the re-use is a fairly 
uncommon thing, in the end.
Remember: think about the hashes as just TLB's, and the VSID's are just 
address space identifiers (yeah, yeah, you can have several VSID's per 
process at least in 32-bit mode, I don't remember the 64-bit thing). So 
what you do is the same thing alpha does with it's 6-bit ASN thing: when 
you wrap around, you blast the whole TLB to kingdom come.
The alpha wraps around a lot more often with just 6 bits, but on the other 
hand it's a lot cheaper to get rid of the TLB too, so it evens out.
Yeah, there are latency issues, but that can be handled by just switching
the hash table base: you have two hash tables, and whenever you increment
the VSID you clear a small part of the other table, designed so that when
the VSID wraps around the other table is 100% clear, and you just switch
the two.
You _can_ switch the hash table base around on ppc64, can't you?
So now the VM invalidate becomes
	++vsid;
	partial_clear_secondary_hash();
	if (++vsid > MAXVSID)
		vsid = 0;
		switch_hashes();

Ahh, my mind is going.

Maybe somebody is seeing the light.

Sure, sounds reasonable.
