True, we can just remove the param for iw_mode.

The driver features some firmware-specific WDS functionality, such as
adding/removing WDS links. We haven't looked much into it yet though since
it's not high priority. Where exactly should this code go to then?
Elements noted as DONE were just committed into our CVS repository. You
can always find our latest 2.6 kernel patch at:
http://prism54.org/pub/linux/snapshot/kernel/v2.6/patch-2.6-prism54-cvs-latest.bz2
FWIW, the same driver code base supports 2.4:
http://prism54.org/pub/linux/snapshot/kernel/v2.4/patch-2.4-prism54-cvs-latest.bz2
