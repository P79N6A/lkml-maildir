   Since the process sleeps while doing the write(), it cannot munmap
   or do nasty things to the mapping I guess. But the above is
   probably more complicated than it sounds :)
A thread certainly can, and for TCP the write can return before the
networking/driver can safely release the reference.
All of these issues will be dealt with by Stephen Tweedie's kiobuf
interface.  If and when this goes into the standard kernel, you can be
sure I'll make the networking take advantage of it :-)
