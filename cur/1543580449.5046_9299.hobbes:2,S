Can we sort this out once and for all? There are a few emails
everyday relating to this bug.
The following patch posted by "Troels Walsted Hansen" <troels@thule.no>
on Jan 11th fixes this. The problem is that when 2 consequtive
NULLs are sent to klogd it goes into a busy loop. Andrew Mortons
3c59x driver does this, but also on Jan 11th he replied that he had
fixed it. I'm using 2.4ac4 with no problems, so I presume some
of these patches have been lost along the way?
