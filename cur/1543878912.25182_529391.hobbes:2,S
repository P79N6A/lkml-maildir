It's just NFS.  nfsd does open/getdents/close on every readdir
request.
"rm -r" is the application that tends to detect any problems with
cookie handling between the NFS client and server.
(I'm sure there was once an 'rm -r' that used telldir/seekdir, but I
cannot find it.  Maybe it was level-7 UNIX :-)
