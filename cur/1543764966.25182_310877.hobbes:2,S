Well, from what I can read it says "just plain 3-way merge, the same
RCS/CVS thing you've seen before". :-)
Basically, when you look at merge(1) :
SYNOPSIS
       merge [ options ] file1 file2 file3
DESCRIPTION
       merge  incorporates  all  changes that lead from file2 to file3
into file1.
The only big problem is how to guess the best file2 when you give it
file3 and file1.

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
