7400 and 7410 are quite similar. I had the problem on
my old G4 which is a 7400 (I don't have it any more so
I can't tell you about the CPU rev).

You can lose the kernel state as well

Not that rare as soon as you increase the interrupt frequency

The overhead of a single DEC interrupt isn't _that_ high
