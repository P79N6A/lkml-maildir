Were you using Debian/potato with ash by any chance? If so, then the problem
is with the built-in 'echo' which doesn't accept the '-e' and '-n'
commandline arguments and echoes them as part of the message. Linux Makefile
invokes echo with '-n', so if you look into the include/linux/compile.h you
will see at the top that the UTS_VERSION #define looks like this:
-n #define UTS_VERSION
I'm fixing ash right now.
