Hi,
I've been trying to make suspend-to-ram part of my day-by-day life, but there
are still some issues. For example, I did:
$ sync && echo "mem" >/sys/power/state
(I don't know if sync is needed or helps, but I do it anyway - I *really* love my data)
unplugged everything (power, mouse, network cable, ...), got to work, plugged
everything back, power up, dmesg:
[    1.367928] Restarting tasks ... <4>ohci_hcd 0000:00:13.1: Unlink after no-IRQ?  Controller is probably using the wrong IRQ.
[    1.402715] done.
[    1.627564] tg3: eth0: Link is up at 100 Mbps, full duplex.
[    1.627568] tg3: eth0: Flow control is on for TX and on for RX.
[   10.448935] usb 3-3: USB disconnect, address 3
[   10.811866] ohci_hcd 0000:00:13.1: IRQ INTR_SF lossage
[   10.811871] ohci_hcd 0000:00:13.1: leak ed ffff810037991050 (#00) state 0 (has tds)
After this my mouse doesn't work and I'm unable to reboot/poweroff my laptop (not
even alt+sysreq+b work). It locks hard.
I have been playing with pci=assign-busses (thinking about IRQ-s here) and pci=noacpi.
No result. However, with pci=assign-busses I got this (a small variation of the message above):
[    1.743528] Restarting tasks ... <3>hub 1-0:1.0: port 5 disabled by hub (EMI?), re-enabling...
[    1.743563] usb 1-5: USB disconnect, address 3
[    1.782485] usb 1-5: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 6
[    1.785747] done.
[    1.831805] usb 1-5: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
[    1.834418] scsi3 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
[    1.834741] usb-storage: device found at 6
[    1.834785] usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning
[    1.845293] ohci_hcd 0000:00:13.1: Unlink after no-IRQ?  Controller is probably using the wrong IRQ.
I looked in 'kernel-parameters.txt" and in "x86_86/boot-options.txt" but I did not find
anything that could help (that is: usb related).
Has anyone else experienced this?
I'll try to pull 2.6.23-rc8 tonight and play with it. I've seen some ACPI related stuff
in ChangeLog. Who knows ...
Thanks,
