I'm playing with monotone right now.  Superficially it looks like it
has tons of gee-whiz neato stuff...  however, it's *agonizingly* slow.
I mean glacial.  A heavily sedated sloth with no legs is probably
faster.
Using monotone to pull itself too over 2 hours wall-time and 71
minutes of CPU time.
Arguably brand-new CPUs are probably about 2x the speed of what I have
now and there might have been networking funnies --- but that's still
35 monutes to get ~40MB of data.
The kernel is ten times larger, so does that mean to do a clean pull
of the kernel we are looking at (71/2*10) ~ 355 minutes or 6 hours of
CPU time?
