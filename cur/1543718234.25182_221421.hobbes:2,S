Subject: pte_addr_t size reduction for 64 GB case?

When handling 64 GB on i386, pte_addr_t really only
needs 33 bits to find the PTE. It sure doesn't need
the full 64 bits it is using.
How about cheating a bit? If the pte_addr_t only had
the high 32 bits of the 36-bit pointer, it would point
to a pair of the 8-byte PTEs in a 16-byte chunk of RAM.
Then simply examine the PTEs to see which one is the
correct one.
