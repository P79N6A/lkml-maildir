Hi,
a friend of mine ownes this soundcard:
Terratec Base 1
we both don't have the time and resources to try out all combinations of 
chipsets and IRQs/IOPorts inside OSS/Free
So please if someone knows which we should use - write me ....
By the way: You know the XF86Setup? Look at the page "Card". Is there 
somewhere a tools for soundcards which holds a database of all know cards 
and then configures the OSS-drivers? It would be great for all newbies I 
know if they could configure multimedia-hardware themselfes instead 
disturbing profies (while they work at really important tools).
