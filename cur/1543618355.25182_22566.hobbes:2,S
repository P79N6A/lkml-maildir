  Attached, please find the output of a very persistent oops message that stops
one of my webservers cold.  It is linux 2.4.17 patched with rik riel's
rmap10b patch.
I've found the rmap series to be well suited to the fairly extreme
webserving environment
in which I work.  My apologies for not sending you the output of a pristine
kernel oops,
however, my machines die horribly with the vanilla kernel.  The oops message
does not
seem vm related as far as I can tell, but the rmap patch is the only
modification I've made.  
Thank you very much for all the work you guys do!
