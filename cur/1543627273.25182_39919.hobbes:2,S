I am not sure. Could also be bad ram which only triggers under higher
load. I never had instant reboots on my machines due to races, but
only when I had bad DIMMs.
I also have multiple tmpfs instances on my 8-way test box where I
developed and tested tmpfs.
But you could be right. Unfortunately I do not have the time to
investigate further.
