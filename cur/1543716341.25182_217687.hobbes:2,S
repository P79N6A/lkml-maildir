I don't think ioremap is what you want here. ioremap is used to map a PCI
memory region on the card itself. To allocate a DMA region within system
memory to transfer to, you want something like pci_alloc_consistent (but
128MB seems a rather large amount to use for that function, given that it
allocates with GFP_ATOMIC..)
