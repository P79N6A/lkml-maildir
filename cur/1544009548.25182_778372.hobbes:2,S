I expect that the performance numbers for the percpu counters in the
superblock are buried away in the historical git changelogs somewhere. 
I don't recall how much difference it made.
An atomic_inc() of an fs-wide counter will have similar cost to
spin_lock() of an fs-wide lock.
If the multiblock allocator can avoid doing one atomic_inc() for each
block and can instead do atomic_add(large_value, &counter) then yes,
I'm sure that an fs-wide atomic_long_t would be OK.
Of course, similar changes should be made in trucate, etc.
