This makes perfect sense because due to a bug in Award 4.51PG, when in MPS 1.4
mode, the USB port never gets assigned an IRQ in the table... I've got a dirty
hack in my kernel to force it to use IRQ 19 instead of not getting an IRQ
assigned. This is also why under Windows NT in MPS 1.4 mode, you cannot use
any USB devices (under Win2k I mean).
