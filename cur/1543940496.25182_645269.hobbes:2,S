The latter is the problem, but since the queue lock is also held before
doing the double_spin_lock(), we get into even more trouble. The locking
hierarchy is fine, it's always queue lock -> io context locks, so the
above patch should be all that is needed to fix this.
My initial analysis was wrong, that's all :/
