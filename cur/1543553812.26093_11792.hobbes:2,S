But we __do__ use c99 syntax wherever possible. However, not all
of the kernel can be written strictly in 'C'. We need to use some
assembly language for the hardware-specific stuff. Gcc provides
those capabilities. We also need to control the alignment of
some structure members because networking, SCSI, and a few other
links to the outside world count on that. Gcc provides this
capability also. It's a damn good tool.
