test-booted the x64 kernel and found a number of bugs in the x64 port of
the VP patch. I've uploaded -R8 that fixes them:

NOTE: i tested a (non-modular) 64-bit bzImage on a 32-bit OS (FC2) but
havent booted it on a 64-bit userland yet. But i'd expect 64-bit
userspace to work just fine too.
to get a 2.6.9-rc1-bk12 kernel the patching order is:
    
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.8.tar.bz2
  + 
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.9-rc1.bz2
