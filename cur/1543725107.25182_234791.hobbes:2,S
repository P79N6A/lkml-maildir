Read his first sentence and you will see that he has already ordered a
new board.

As far as I read him, he wants to build a kernel that runs on his new
board as well as on his old board.
Basically, he has to just compile a kernel that includes hardware
support for both chipsets, and all of the other hardware that is on the
boards. For processor selection, he should find the best compromise
between both processors (so try to select one that has all features that
both real processors have in common), and he might try the generic X86
optimizations, too.
HTH,
Markus
