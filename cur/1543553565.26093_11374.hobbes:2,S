Yes.  I've done this a bit differently here, and have had good
results.  I only disable stealing when I need flush throughput.
Now that the box isn't biting off more than it can chew quite
as often, I'll try this again.  I'm pretty darn sure that I can
get more throughput, but :> I've learned that getting too much
can do really OOGLY things. (turns box into single user single
tasking streaming IO monster from hell)
