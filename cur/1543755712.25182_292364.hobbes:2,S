Architectures should guarantee that any of the atomics and bitops that
return values order in both directions. So you dont need the
smp_mb__before_atomic_dec here.
It is, however, required on the atomics and bitops that dont return
values. Its difficult stuff, everyone gets it wrong and Andrew keeps
hassling me to write up a document explaining it.
