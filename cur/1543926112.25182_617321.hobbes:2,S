Absolutely that's what I mean, it's atomic and gives you exactly what
you need.
I see nothing wrong or gross with these semantics.  Nothing in the
"book of UNIX" specifies that for a device or special file the passed
in buffer cannot contain input control data.

Not necessarily, consider the possibility of using recvmsg() control
message data.  With that it could be done in one go.
This also suggests that it could be implemented as it's own protocol
family.
