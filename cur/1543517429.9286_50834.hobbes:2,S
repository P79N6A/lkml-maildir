The kernel can do nothing to serialize you. Attaching a shared memory
segment in memory from physical point of view is exactly as running SMP
threaded with clone. The difference is only in the amount of memory
that you share across the tasks.
You have the same physical page shared and writeable by lots of tasks at
the same time. So all tasks can read and write on the same page at the
same time.
