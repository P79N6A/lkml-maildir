Well...  kinda sorta.
We -used- to really have documentation with the thing it documents, like
drivers/foo/README.  In-lined source comments are one piece of the
puzzle yes, but the -bulk- of the docs are not anywhere near the thing
it documents.
I actually don't like stuffing documents in Documentation/DocBook
proper...  I've put docs for two drivers in there, but if the trend
continues a new dir structure will need to evolve.
Either we'll want Documentation/DocBook/<category>, or move the docbook
docs into the standard Documentation/* hierarchy......... or we'll start
moving docs back outside Documentation/*
