Well, Marcelo - i am happy with new ACPI, Alan does (otherwise it wouldn't be 
included into ac tree). We will welcome it in 2.4.22-pre1 :]
Anyway, still ACPI does not work fully in my PCG-C1VE Sony Vaio. I don't know 
if due to incompatibilities of this equipment ?
All other servers/desktops works perfectly fine for me :D
Thanks guys.
