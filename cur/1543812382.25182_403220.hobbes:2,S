OK, I see. It's a wrapper function for files_stat.max_files, which was
the current exported symbol in the mainline kernel.
It's used here, basically, to cap the number of sockets in existence, to
prevent rogue processes from chewing up all your memory.
If I understand your position correctly, you believe that it is
inappropriate for this symbol to be publicly visible to a subsystem that
is dynamically linked, but that it is OK for it to be publicly visible
to the same subsystem, when it is statically linked instead.
Did I misunderstand you?
