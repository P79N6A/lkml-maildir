Subject: [PATCH SIS IDE] sis5513.c v0.13 final against 2.4.19-pre2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Oops, mailed Marcelo, Andre and Alan but forgot to CC lkml, here it's done...
Hi,
as no bugreport came in since last post, here's a patch against 2.4.19-pre2
for the SiS IDE driver. It brings ATA16 and ATA33 chipset families support
as well as ATA66 and ATA100 bugfixes. Configure.help and MAINTAINERS are
updated.
This is roughly the same driver than the one in 2.4.19-pre2-ac2
(verbose debug messages deactivated and some cleanups).
I consider it to large (35276 bytes) for lkml posting, so
here's a link to it:

Please apply,
LB.
PS: Alan, a patch against 2.4.19-pre2-ac4 is coming RSN.
