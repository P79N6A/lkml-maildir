Problem is, things like bus resets happen in interrupt, and while I can
push off some things to occur in the nodemgr thread, a lot of other
stuff has to happen in the interrupt, and they require the same lock.
It's all a matter of just tossing out my todo list for a good week and
redoing all of this logic from the ground up. I have high hopes this
will happen in the next few weeks, but I'm not signing any contracts to
hold me to it :)

I might have to dig that out and try to make use of it. Thanks for the
pointer.
