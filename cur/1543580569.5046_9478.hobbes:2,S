	A bit of documentation at the beginning of the Makefile would do wonders
for kernel-developer (not end user, please!) clarity.  I've oft'asked the question
as to what really is supported.  I've tried things like make dep bzImage modules --
I noticed it didn't work fairly quickly.  Same with modules/modules_install -- 
people would probably figure that one out, but just a bit of documentation would
help even that.
