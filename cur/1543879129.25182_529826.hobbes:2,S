Will not work, because tmpfs does not use any memory for unused space. If
you don't believe me, simply create a large file on your tmpfs, then check
free memory, then remove the file and check free memory again.
So your problem is not caused by the empty space on tmpfs, but either by
too much space used on tmpfs or by your application using too much memory.

Not needed, the one-liner "main(){while(malloc(4096));}" is enough to
trigger an OOM.
If you cannot control your application's memory usage, you'll have to finely
tune the overcommit_ratio.
