Most all the nodemask/cpumask operators are like that.  It allows
writing *mask code as if masks were pass by value (which is how the
vast majority of kernel hackers, working on systems with one-word
masks, think of them), while actually passing by reference, to
avoid unnecessary stack copies of multiword masks.

It's not deliberate that I am aware of.
But it does seem to be the common practice ....
All the bitmap routines are that way - no GPL.  In fact it seems that
almost all the EXPORT_SYMBOLS in the lib/*.c routines are that way - 12
with GPL and 174 without GPL, or some such.  The only lib/*.c GPL
exports are in lib/klist.c and lib/kobject_uevent.c.
Is this bad?
