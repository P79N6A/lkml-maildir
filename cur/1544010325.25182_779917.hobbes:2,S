Did you get any false positives? Or were you expecting false negatives
because of freelist scanning which never occurred?

It should scan the per-CPU areas in the memleak_scan() function:
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
	/* per-cpu sections scanning */
	for_each_possible_cpu(i)
		scan_block(__per_cpu_start + per_cpu_offset(i),
			   __per_cpu_end + per_cpu_offset(i), NULL);
#endif

They should be scanned as well.

It was scanning the mem_map arrays in the past but removed this part and
haven't seen any problems (on ARM).
Why would the ->freelist be a problem? I don't fully understand the slub
allocator. Aren't objects added to the freelist only after they were
freed? In __slab_alloc there seems to be a line:
c->page->freelist = NULL;
so the freelist won't count as a reference anymore. After freeing an
object, kmemleak no longer cares about references to it.
