A follow-up
by shutting down PCMCIA and rmmod'ing all the related modules ie ide_cs, 
ds, yenta_socket, pcmcia_core the suspend works on AC again.
So, I add them back one by one:
pcmcia_core -> still works
yenta_socket -> FAILS!
rmmod yenta_socket -> works again!
Summary: suspend works on my Thinkpad T21
(a) with no apm module or apmd but with all PCMCIA (ie. hardware 
suspend- close lid etc);
(b) with apm & apmd and all PCMCIA but no AC power
(c) with apm & apmd but no yenta_socket and the rest but with AC power
The problem is a combination of apm, yenta_socket and AC power.
