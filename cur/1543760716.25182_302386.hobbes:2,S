I upgraded from 2.6.5 to 2.6.11.2 and my ancient (libc4 a.out) /sbin/portmap from 1994 that's been running without complaint
on kernels for 11 years now consistently segfaults.
I upgraded to a version 4 RPM (circa 2002) and that fixed it.
If some compatibility was broken on purpose, that's fine, although I couldn't find anything in the kernel docs.
I know, I should upgrade everything, but that can break a lot of things too...
Thought I'd mention it though in case it's a bug or somebody else has the same problem.
