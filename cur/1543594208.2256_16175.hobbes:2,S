We don't need such a CONFIG_xxx at all.  The current PCI core code
should scale up just fine.
According to the PCI spec it is -impossible- to have more than 256 buses
on a single "hose", so you simply have to implement multiple hoses, just
like Alpha (and Sparc64?) already do.  That's how the hardware is forced
to implement it...
