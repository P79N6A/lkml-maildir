Subject: ACPI vs. APM power-off: proposed patch to linux-2.3.31/drivers/misc/acpi.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	On every computer on which I have tried the last few linux-2.3.x
releases, the hardware power off did not work.  This is because if the
kernel is built with both CONFIG_ACPI and CONFIG_APM, the acpi routine
is the one that is set to be the power off handler, because it is
initialized later and overwrites the variable.  I guess the machines
experiencing the problem support APM power down but not ACPI power down.
	The following patch fixes the problem by having the ACPI
power off handler call the previous value of acpi_power_off (usually
apm_power_off).  This implementation does not add any direct references
to the apm code, so it does not introduce any new usage of autoconfig.h.
It also does not impede the unloading of acpi, so it should not impede
any effort to modularize the acpi support.  So, I think this is the
right approach for supporting software power down functinality on
the widest variety of hardware platforms.
	Anyhow, this patch works for me.
