That change can't fix a bug in 2.6.13, because ppos is forced to be
non-null further up the file:
    622 static ssize_t do_sendfile(int out_fd, int in_fd, loff_t *ppos,
...
    647         if (!ppos)
    648                 ppos = &in_file->f_pos;
...
    684         pos = *ppos;
...
    701         current->syscr++;
    702         current->syscw++;
    703 
    704         if (*ppos > max)
    705                 retval = -EOVERFLOW;
(line numbers from 2.6.13.)
So there must be something else at work.  Perhaps your patches?

That would be wrong, too; if it were valid to call in with ppos==0, you
wouldn't want to return EOVERFLOW; and if ppos==0 were not valid and you
wanted to return an error, EOVERFLOW would be the wrong error to return.
