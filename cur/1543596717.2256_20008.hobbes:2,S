What the hell _is_ "populated ramfs"? The thing doesn't live in array
of blocks. Its directory structure consists of a bunch of dentries.
Permissions/ownership/timestamps are in a bunch of struct inode -
sitting in icache and allocated in normal way. Regular files are
entirely in pagecache, ditto for symlinks.
Ramfs has no backing store. At all. That's precisely what remains of
filesystem if you take backing store away - everything is in VFS/VM caches.
