It already is.  The combination of circumstances is pretty
remote, and indeed may never happen.  But the final put_page()
against an LRU page will go BUG() because the page is on the LRU.
And a page_cache_reelase() in IRQ context could deadlock over
pagemap_lru_lock() (it'll go BUG in -aa kernels).

I don't think it can happen in 2.4.  In the truncate case,
the page is taken off the LRU by hand.  If do_flushpage()
failed then the buffers still have a ref on the page, which
is undone in shrink_cache(), inside pagemap_lru_lock.
So, probably safe, but way too subtle.
