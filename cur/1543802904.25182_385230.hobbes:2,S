The Xen virtual hardware is exposed in the normal way (there is a Xen 
bus so Xen devices show up under that).

In very, very different ways though.

To expose the hypercalls to userspace via sysfs (or another high level 
interface) would require a whole bunch of complex code to encode the 
hypercalls and decode there results.  I'm not sure having a common 
interface is a compelling argument to justify this kernel-level 
complexity since one can just standardize on a userspace library 
(something like 
http://www.libvir.org
).
I do agree we need a common interface though...
