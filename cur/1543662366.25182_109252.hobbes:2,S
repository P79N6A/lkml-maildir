Ben's patches are against a very old version of the kernel (2.4.6-pre8)
and require linking against libgcc to get 64-bit division.
The main issue is 64-bit division.  In the limited time I had I
couldn't convince myself that I could rely on all divisors being less
than 2^31 in the raid4/5 code.  If you can convince yourself of that,
then t's a straightforward but tedious task to make raid1, raid4 and
raid5 LBD-safe.

You are lost in a maze of BitKeeper repositories, all almost the same.
