I have updated the lck patchset. This is the patchset formerly known as
the 2.4-ck patchset. I apologize for the long delay in releasing this
patch, but paid work had to come first.
http://www.plumlocosoft.com/kernel/
Includes:
O(1) scheduler with batch scheduling, interactivity
Preemptible kernel
Low Latency
Read Latency2
Variable Hz
64-bit jiffies
Supermount-NG v1.2.11a
Bootsplash v3.0.7
POSIX ACL/xattr v0.8.71
POSIX extended security attributes v0.8.71
NTFS file system v2.1.6b
Updated:
- I have merged PPC fixes for the O(1) scheduler and the variable hertz
patch, so 32-bit PPC kernels should work now.
- I have attempted to make the patchset gcc 3.4 compatible. If I have
missed anything, let me know.
Pending:
- GRsec update to version 2.0.2.
-Eric
