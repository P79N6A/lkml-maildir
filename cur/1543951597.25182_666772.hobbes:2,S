It is a device mapper target (though there is no real advantage in that
other than having a handy plug-in api).  It does handle any two block
devices, and it does populate on cache miss.  But also has daemon-driven
population, since it never makes sense to leave the backing disk idle
then have to incur read latency because of that later.
