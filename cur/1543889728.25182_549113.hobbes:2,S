Subject: [patch 0/7] RFC: PS3 Storage Drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Hi,
This is the first submission of the new PS3 storage drivers:
 [1] ps3: Preallocate bootmem memory for the PS3 FLASH ROM storage driver
 [2] ps3: Extract ps3_repository_find_bus()
 [3] ps3: Storage Driver Core
 [4] ps3: Storage Driver Probing
 [5] ps3: Disk Storage Driver
 [6] ps3: ROM Storage Driver
 [7] ps3: FLASH ROM Storage Driver
They are submitted purely for review, as some of the underlying infrastructure
code hasn't been submitted yet (for reference, you can take a look at Geoff's
git tree (git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geoff/ps3-linux.git)).
Thanks for you comments!
Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
						Geert
