Yes, that's about it.
Number 1 seemed to cause the most crashes, I don't think number 2 ever
caused any problems, but it might have, there were too many weird oopses
to be able to rule that out.
But in the end, I don't think that PCI really will benefit from this
speed wise, but I think the kernel overall will benefit if we can
document those dependencies somehow.
