I still don't understand the complexity.
Why the list of pages? Is there really any valid use for this that could 
overflow a simple "kmalloc()"? How many groups do people really really 
need? 
I just find it wrong to go from 32 to millions. And a few thousand can
trivially be handled by a normal "kmalloc()".
Basically, I find overdesign physically nauseating. This is less so than 
the original stuff, but I'm still finding myself asking "Why?".
