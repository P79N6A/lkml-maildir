It does look quite simple.  Nice work.

You're the first one to get one of these in for an alternate
architecture.  We'll need to keep an eye out so that one of these
doesn't pop up on each of the 64-bit arches with no highmem as we add
support.  But, this should be just fine for now.

For some reason, I thought we were officially supposed to use
__FUNCTION__ for stuff like this.  However, I am usually lazy in my
debugging patches and use __func__.  I'm a bad example.
This also looks a bit past 80 columns.
