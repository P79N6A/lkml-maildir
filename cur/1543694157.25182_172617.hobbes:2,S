Hello
I have collected from tidbits of information that
ether=0,0,0x201,0,eth0 should set my 3c900 card to full duplex AUI.
I have tried this, then ifconfig eth0 up and then
vortex-diag -vv and it still reports MAC Settings: half-duplex
When I rewrite all occurences of full_duplex in 3c59x.c for hard-coded
"1", then I get MAC Settings: full-duplex
How do I set up this driver to force full-duplex AUI for 3c900 network
card without using modules and without patching 3c59x.c?
