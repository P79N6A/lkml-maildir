The romfs filesystem has a linux.bin.z kernel file, fipmodule.o and a
khwl.o file, both of which I think are modules. The khwl.o file seems to
be the driver. `strings khwl.o` reveals among other things:
(hwl0)minor_ioctl: REALMAGICHWL_IOCTL_CLEAR_MODULE_USE_COUNT done.
(hwl0)minor_ioctl: process %d enters (case %d) ----------------
(hwl0)minor_ioctl: unknown ioctl or feature not supported (see
REALMAGICHWL_FEATURES)
(hwl0)minor_ioctl: process %d leaves (case %d, return %d) ------
(hwl0)open done by %d (user count #%d)
(hwl0)close done by %d (user count #%d)
(hwl#)init_module: begun
realmagichwl0
(hwl#)init_module: devfs_register failed
(hwl#)init_module: device (%d:%d) registered in devfs
(hwl#)init_module: found JASPER
(hwl#)cleanup_module: begun
(hwl#)cleanup_module: done

The player is a file called mpegplayer.bin. 
uClinux supports module loading, doesn't it?
