Wine.
Mapping windows binaries in a Linux address space.
Portability is a non-issue: this would only work on a 386, and only on
Linux anyway (MAYBE on other architectures Wine supports, but that's their
problem). 
Windows binaries are _not_ nicely aligned like the Linux ones. They are
often 512-byte aligned.
Yes, we can read them in. That is slow as hell, and doesn't allow sharing. 
Bad.

We would not guarantee write coherency for anything but the page-aligned
case.
