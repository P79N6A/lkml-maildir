Forgive me reading into your mail...this smells a bit like some kind of
licensing/compliance thing. Just bear in mind that using the MAC to
verify the identity of a machine is utterly useless and pointless -
anyone can trivially fool your software[0] to see what it "wants".

prevent the silly powers that be who "banned" network cards other than
those made by one manufacturer from being used on their little network.
