Davem looks at it the wrong way. In-order is very much the default for
sane architectures.
A sane architecture has a extra bit that _allows_ re-ordering to certain
areas or pages. It should be off by default, but it might be turned on by
specific drivers. We may add a hint field to "ioremap()" for PCI, for
example, to let PCI devices that know thay can do write combining have a
way to let the CPU know to go wild..

Almost ALL the current drivers depend on not re-ordering. There are
actually very few cases where you can be allowed to re-order widly, and
frame buffers is the only really common case.
Certain other drivers allow a subset of re-ordering which is to allow
collapsing of write events - turning consecutive byte stores into word
stores etc. Not really re-ordering the input or output, but combining
events (works for reads too: a way to tell the hardware that it is ok to
do burst reads over the bus if the pre-fetch logic implies that it makes
sense).
