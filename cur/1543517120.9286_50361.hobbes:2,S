I guess that almost all pipelined processors will reorder this (that's
not a speculative execution issue), because reads are performed early
in the pipeline and writes at the end. Suppose we have 5 stages
(fetch-decode-read-exec-write), then the above two instructions will
first read B and then write A.
                  T0    T1     T2     T3    T4    T5
 write A          fetch decode read   exec  write
 read B                 fetch  decode read  exec  write
The read happens in T3 and the write in T4. When doing:
      write A
      read A
the CPU can detect this and internally forward A from stage 4 directly
to stage 3. But this doesn't work with SMP since one CPU cannot look
into the pipeline of the other CPU.
