Mostly I do it both ways - if /dev/dsp is opened O_RDONLY (or O_WRONLY),
another process is allowed to open it O_WRONLY (or O_RDONLY). If it
opens O_RDWR, noone else is allowed.
This is sometimes useful, Sun does it also that way (but it only
works if you can set the sampling rate independently for both
directions).
