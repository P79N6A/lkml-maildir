I've been running 2.5.64-mm4 for a couple of
hours now, and having logged in/out of X, it
seems to be holding up so far, no oopses yet -
I have to say, doing the "dbench + lament +
dragging an xterm around the screen" test in
2.5.64-mm4 is absolutely a dream on this
little celeron box  - in fact it absolutely blows
away my more powerful P4-1800 running
2.4.20-ck4, which has the benefit of all the
2.4 low latency goodies.
Keep up the good work guys -
Best Regards,
Joe
