hmmm ... when i was working on the athlon disconnect patch i found that
the pcr files (resorce files) for the wpcredit programm (windows tool for
changing the configuration of chipset) are a good source of information.
but this register isn't discribed in this file ... sorry
daniel
(i placed the pcr file on the web, if you are interested, have a look at:
http://cip.uni-trier.de/nofftz/linux/kt266_pcr.txt
 ... the webserver is
down at the moment, but should be up again in 1-2 hours)
