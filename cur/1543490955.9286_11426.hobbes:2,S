So basically...
 1. Use mkisofs to create a CD image ready for burning to a CD.
 2. Discover it's slightly too large, so delete it.
 3. Run the RC5 contest tool from distributed.net whilst you work
    out how to reduce the size of the CD image so everything fits.
That doesn't sound particularly unlikely to me...
Best wishes from Riley.
