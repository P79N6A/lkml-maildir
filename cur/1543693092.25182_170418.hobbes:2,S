Hi,
I'm running Mandrake 9.2RC1 (kernel 2.4.22) and I can't make work S-ATA 
boot drive and Intel Pro onboard network.
The Asus P4C800E-Dlx in the only mainboard in the P4x800 family with 
ICH5R and Intel 82547EI (Gb onboard chip, it uses e1000 driver).
The chips share the same IRQ :
# grep eth0 /proc/interrupts
  17:         83   IO-APIC-level  Intel ICH5, eth0
(note that there's no error about this in syslog)
1) Boot on S-ATA drive / Mandrake 9.2RC1 with "acpi=off"
-> boot OK, but no ping, "NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out" in 
syslog.
(full log and config on 
http://plochon.free.fr/mdk92RC1.html
 )
2) Boot on S-ATA drive / Mandrake 9.2RC1 with "acpi=off" and "noapic"
-> boot hang (when displays "hde: attached ide_disk driver" where hde is 
the S-ATA boot drive)
3) Same tests but boot on CD with Knoppix 3.3 (Kernel 2.4.22)
-> same results
4) S-ATA drive physically removed, boot on CD / Knoppix 3.3 with 
"acpi=off" and "noapic"
-> boot OK, network OK : it works !
Is there a way to make S-ATA and Intel Pro work together, or is it an 
incompatibility ?
Thanks,
Philippe
My hardware configuration:
P4C800E-Dlx, P4C@2.6Ghz, 256Mb, 1 Seagate S-ATA drive plugged on 
standard S-ATA connector (-> not on S-ATA RAID connector)
IDE Bios settings :
Onboard IDE operate mode	: Enhanced mode
Enhanced mode support on	: S-ATA
Configure S-ATA as RAID		: No
