But what does "write-combine" mean?  There are many different
implementations of basically this same idea, and implementing
just the lowest common denominator of this will hardly get us
out of the mess we are in already.

What exactly will "weak" mean?  If it's weak enough to please all
architectures and busses, it'll be so weak that you'll need 2**N
(with a big N) different barriers.

ioremap is a bad name anyway, if we'll change the API, change the
name as well (and it's a bad idea to keep the same name but make it
mean something different, anyway).

Not sure what this means?  Document them in all-caps?  :-)

In my proposal at least, those drivers won't lose any performance
(except for a conditional on their I/O cookie, which is a trivial
performance loss compared to the cost of the I/O /an sich/); they
won't need any changes either, except for some renaming.  Drivers
_not_ using it might get a performance loss though, because they
will be forced to run with every-I/O-ordered semantics; they will
suddenly start to work *correctly* though.
