Hello again,
I've found the sources (thanks to Rob Turk), and the module compiles
under 2.2.10, loads without complaint, but when I try to use the
utilities included in the tarball, it gives me:
open("/dev/sch0", O_RDONLY)             = -1 ENOSYS (Function not
implemented)
open("/dev/sch0", O_RDONLY)             = -1 ENOSYS (Function not
implemented)
open("/dev/sch0", O_RDONLY)             = -1 ENODEV (No such device)
I'm not a kernel programmer, so I'd be very happy if someone could
help me fix this.
greetings
endre
