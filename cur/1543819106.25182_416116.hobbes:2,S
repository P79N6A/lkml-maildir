Tried to figure out what is causing the delays I experienced when I replaced
module_init() in af_inet.c with fs_initcall(). After all it turned out that
synchronize_net() which is basicically nothing else than synchronize_rcu()
sometimes takes several seconds to complete?! No idea why that is...
callchain: inet_init() -> inet_register_protosw() -> synchronize_net()
