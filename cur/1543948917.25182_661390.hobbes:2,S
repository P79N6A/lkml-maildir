A shame.
Most of the conflicts will be due to all the
-#include <asm/semaphore.h>
+#include <linux/semaphore.h>
but they're all optional anyway, because include/asm-*/semaphore.h is
#include <linux/semaphore.h>
so either a) you just ignore all those conflicts or b) we ask Willy to
remove all that stuff and we can trickle it in via subsystems later.
