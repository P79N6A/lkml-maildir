That's very likely. Anyway, pure luck is still better than no luck

Right, but the point is that while 2.6 has such an infrastructure, its
introduction actually completely broke UHCI suspend / resume.

Which, again, leads us to conclusion that it was the driver model change
that broke that.

Enough of that, this is becoming off-topic. :)
