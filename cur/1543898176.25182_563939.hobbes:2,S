well, I'm more thinking of the advertisement value of having some sort of 
pointer in the MAINTAINERS file to the exact location of a certain subsystem. 
Quite often I find myself searching somewhere in /drivers/ only to find out that 
the stuff I need is in asm/arch or elsewhere. E.g. alsa is a driver but lives in 
/sound/. Having a voluntary field (usable for other purposes) in the MAINTAINERS 
field seems awfully appropriate in that place and very low impact.
git does have that info, except for the fact that quite often others touch the 
same subsystem much more than the maintainer (pci, net, etc)...
