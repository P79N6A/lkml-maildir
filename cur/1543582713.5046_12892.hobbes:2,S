Alan: thanks again for your prompt response!
bus mastered DMA ring buffer. As to the load, I'm not quite sure... we
were using a fairly large ring buffer, but increasing/decreasing the size
didn't seem to affect the number of packets per interrrupt. I added a
little watermarking code, and it seems that we do (at peak) about 30-35
packets per interrupt. That is STILL a heck of a lot of interrupts! I
can't quite figure out why the driver refuses to go deeper.
I can think of a couple possible solutions. our interface has a HUGE
amount of hardware buffers, so I can easily simply stop reading for
a small time if we detect conjestion... can you suggest a nice clean
mechanism for this?
any other ideas?
