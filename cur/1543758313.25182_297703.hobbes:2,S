Subject: [patch 00/16] NFSACL protocol extension for NFSv3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here is an update of the whole NFSACL patchset. I think I have addressed
all issues brought up, except for these two:
 - Not sure what do do about the Solaris compatibility hack. It's
   ugly no matter how we hide it, so I'll probably keep it the way
   it is now,
 - Matt's heapsort is defective, so I'm not using it right now.
Regards,
