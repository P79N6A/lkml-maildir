	Huh?
	16 bits => 65536 users (Current)
	32 bits => 4,294,967,296 users (including 0 and -1)
	4 Billion user id's is not enough?
	(Putting on my Samba Development Team hat now)...  One possible
reason for going to 64 bit uid_t and gid_t would be to aid mapping Windows
global ids to Unix uids and gids.  The Windows IDs include information about
the domain they're a part of.  Windows IDs are also used for groups,
users (a group ID is just another user ID - which is not a bad idea),
and machines.  Mapping them is a major pain.  That would be important
for ntfs as well as samba.
