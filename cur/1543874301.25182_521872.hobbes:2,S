Thank you James.
I will submit new patch that will throttle (if required) from
eh_timed_out call back.

OK, this is still not nice.  What you need to be doing is intercepting
the timeout before it fires (and quiesces the machine).  Currently the
eh_timed_out() callback is only exposed to transport classes, I'll put
it back into the host template and then you can use it.
