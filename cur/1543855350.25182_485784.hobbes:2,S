Yeah, I don't think it was worth it.
That said, Alexey did check it more than most patches like this get 
checked (ie checking allmodconfig on i386, x86_64, alpha, arm), so it's a 
bit unlucky that MIPS got bitten by this - it was not a badly tested 
patch per se.
Does the obvious fix (to include <linux/kernel.h> in irqflags.h) fix it 
for you?
