I don't think ifdefing around functions is that bad for this sort of
workaround code. You have to take the address of the function with my
above code, so you can't use an inline one. I don't think the
preprocessor can solve the problem either because it seems you'd need
conditional compilation directives within a macro. I'm not a C expert
though so someone might have a way to do it.
