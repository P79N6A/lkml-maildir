   This won't work for the bh lock protected case outlined above, and
   will cause contention between different users of zlib.
My understanding is that these are just scratchpads.  The contents
while a decompress/compress operation is not occuring does not
matter.
So if we have 2 such scratchpads per cpu, one for normal and one for
BH context, his idea truly can work and be useful to everyone.
It would also be lockless on SMP.
