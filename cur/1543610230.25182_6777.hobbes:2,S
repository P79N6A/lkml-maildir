If you wanna do this type of cleanup, you can take it one step forward;
remember that the order of evaluation of foo and bar doesn't have to be
{foo => bar} so it can be {bar => foo}  I hope gcc's behaviour doesn't
change under our feet.
	a = foo (i) + bar (j);
.. sprinkle some pointer arithmetic over there for fun ;)
