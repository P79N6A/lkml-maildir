Does not work...
Boots up, probes each ID, fails, takes 15-20 sec per timeout for each ID,
then actually does boot after (15-20sec)*7ID for that board.
I used same exact (SCSI-CONFIG) for VIA board, worked fine, guess there
are problems with IRQs or something?
I'd send log/more information but don't feel like writing 10 pages of text
down to send to lkml.
