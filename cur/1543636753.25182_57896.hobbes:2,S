That is what they do use, but the code is pushed into the architecture
headers so you can do something else if you choose.
I originally just had a single generic version, but people representing
the greater good of SPARC and PA-RISC argued otherwise.  It should be
simple enough to just paste the generic implementations into your
asm/spinlock.h if you do not want to do any hand-tuning.
