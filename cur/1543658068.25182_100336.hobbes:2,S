No, because (for SCSI-1) the minimum is 5.

We don't do a second request.

Right.

I think you misunderstand the problems. We do not ask for anything else.
There are two problems: a SCSI and a USB problem.
In the SCSI code a length of 5 is legal. Now the code
allocates space for these 5 bytes but subsequently uses
pointers to vendor etc that point past the end of the allocated area.
If ever anything is written via these pointers random memory is corrupted.
And "cat /proc/scsi/scsi" shows randow junk.
A bug that has to be fixed, independently of USB.
The SCSI code has no means of knowing the actual length transferred,
so has no choice but to believe the length byte in the reply.
But the USB code does the transferring itself, and knows precisely
how many bytes were transferred. If 36 bytes were transferred and
the additional length byte is 0, indicating a length of 5, then the
USB code can fix the response and change the additional length byte
to 31, indicating a length of 36. That way the SCSI code knows that
not 5 but 36 bytes are valid, and it gets actual vendor and model strings.
