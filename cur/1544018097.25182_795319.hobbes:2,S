Well.  The "just update the pointers" argument is bogous.  It simply
doesn't work in general for a number of reasons:
First, it assumes that there is a pointer you can update in the first place.
Second, it assumes you can easily update all pointer instances pointing
to your data.  Finding all places which need updating might be
non-trivial or impossible.  This tends to be true for refcounted data
structures.
Third, updating pointers can have extra costs, such as locking
requirements in threaded applications.
Of course there are also tons of applications where it is absolutely no
problem to just update the pointer.
But I think that applications using the vectored I/O very likely belong
to the group which can't.  Otherwise there would be little reason to use
the vectored API in the first place.

You could (assuming you don't break POSIX along the way).  I don't think
apps would use such an interface though for the reasons outlined above.
 The readz() prototype by Ullrich (without iovecs being involved) looks
much more reasonable to me.
