complicated, doesn't buy as anything, it also means the blocks are
tied up whilst they are being zeroed (consider a truncated on a
multi-gb file, fairly common)

it doesn't zero after a crash, what happens is the blocks never make
it to disk and the metadata (which did make it to disk) reflects this
so read returns nulls
as is, you can truncate a multi-gb file, write over it and the only IO
you see will be the new data being written out,  zeroing in between
would be horribly pianful
