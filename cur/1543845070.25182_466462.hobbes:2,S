RFC 791 (IPv4) Appendix B does give instructions on byte ordering for 
all IPv4 headers and data, and RFC 791 is listed in the References for 
RFC 3378.  I noticed this is only Informational, not a Standards track 
document, so I guess the non-interoperable implementations kind of go 
with the territory.
