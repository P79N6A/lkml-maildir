Subject: PROBLEM: linux-2.2.{1,2,3} can't toggle (16550) UART line DTR

Hi folks,
since I couldn't fix it myself, I file following BUG-REPORT:
[1.] with vanilla linux kernels 2.2.{1,2,3} I can't toggle the DTR line -
	with 2.0.34 I can.
[2.] setting c_lflag to speed 0 (masking with CTBAUD and |ing B0) and using
 cfsetospeed(), cfsetispeed(), tcsetattr() should toggle the (16550) UART
line 'DTR', causing a connected modem to hang-up (reset). With a Linux 2.0.34
kernel it does work as expected, but not so with any Linux 2.2.x kernel so
far. I tested also the terminal application 'minicom' (V1.75) - same results.
[3.] serial-i/o  2.0/2.2 incompatibility
[4.] Linux version 2.2.3 (root@prawda) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) 
[5.] n/a
[6.] on request. but try minicom's hangup by toggle DTR feature.

[7.5.]
	Debian 2.0 Distribution - partly upgraded
	I tried various glibc2 versions, recompiled my code and minicom,
	but nothing helped.
	I didn't touched the kernel so far. I'm using the on-board UARTs
	and configured the kernel as follows:
--8<--
CONFIG_SERIAL=y
# CONFIG_SERIAL_CONSOLE is not set
# CONFIG_SERIAL_EXTENDED is not set
# CONFIG_SERIAL_NONSTANDARD is not set    
-->8--
Any hint is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
