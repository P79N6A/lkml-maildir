Subject: 2.6.6 & prism54: Computer gets stuck pretty often

Hi folks,
I am not sure how to reproduce this reliably, but using
the prism54 device my i386 machine gets stuck pretty often
(about 3 times a day). The mouse freezes, I cannot switch
to another vt, but Alt-SysRq-b works.
If I use an old 3c59x PCI card to connect to the net, then
there is no such problem.
Kernel is 2.6.6 (without any patches).
Is there any way I could help to find a fix?
Regards
Harri
