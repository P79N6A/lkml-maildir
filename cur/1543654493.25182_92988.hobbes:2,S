hi!
maybe somone remembers that i hacked a little bit with the power saving
modes of the athlon processor. so far as i know, the clk_ctl register is
importand when the athlon processor comes back from acpi-c2 mode. in c2 he
is disconnected from the system bus and the internal clock is clocked
down. in some cases a false value in this register could prevent the
athlon processor to come back from c2 -> lockup of the machine or
something like it ...
(bug 11 of the athlon processor revision guide)
