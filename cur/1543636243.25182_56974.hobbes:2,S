Subject: A kernel bug of sorts...

Just a quick note... it appears that "i2c-old.h" has been omitted from the
2.5.25 kernel source (tar.bz2).
Keep on the good work...
cheers

PS I am looking to implement a "quick" way to use the S510 USB video grabber
board released by many companies (although no longer manufactured).  This
appears to be a SAA7111/W9966CF combo with the lucent USS720 chip to magic
into a USB style adapter.  Pretty standard I think.  Although if anyone else
has already solved this trivial issue, it would save me some time.
