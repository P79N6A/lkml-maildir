No, but I'm pretty sure it means that we don't want either mkinitrd
included in module-init-tools.  I have no idea whether the two are
even compatible.
I certainly don't have the expertise to maintain either one: they both
seem to have happy, active maintainers who *do* know what they are
doing.
FYI, .deb files have the nice feature that they can be extracted using
standard tools: "file foo.deb" should tell it is a standard ar
archive.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
