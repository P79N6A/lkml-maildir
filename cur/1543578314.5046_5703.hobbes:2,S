AFAIK, that's perfectly correct.  It's only the case where you have a
label at the end of a block (without a statement following it) where
it's an error.
In the grammar, a statement must follow a label, but a
labeled-statement is a type of statement, so you can stack labels as
much as you want, as long as there's a statement somewhere after them.
That is, assuming I'm reading the standard right (ISO/IEC 9899:1990,
Section 6.6, 6.6.1).
