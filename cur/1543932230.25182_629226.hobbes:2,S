Hmmm...  perhaps.  I remember that cropped up in NFS, but I'm doing things a
bit differently to NFS.  Remind me again how that worked please.

Eh?  It's a stateless network filesystem.  There's a gap between writing to a
file (perhaps though an mmap) and the pagecache pages being written back in
which someone may change the security on a file and block the writeback.
There's nothing I can do to prevent it, so I have to instead deal with the
consequences should they arise.  See the description of patch 25 for examples.
So you say I shouldn't do any writeback caching at all?

Erm...  Because it deadlocks?
