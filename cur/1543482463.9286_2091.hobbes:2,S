Ok, sorry it seems I missed a few threads a few months ago.  Also, I do
remember having similar problems with submodules in cvs, and I guess we will
have to wait until PRCS2 i think it is called. Which is OK, as things are 
working now, just trying to avoid future problems, but im sure when the time
comes PRCS2 or some better version/source management system will be ready :)
