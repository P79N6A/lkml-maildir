Right.

How is that useful? read(2) errors out on a directory, and that is fine
with me. If xemacs wants to do funky stuff when opening a directory, it is
free to notice that special case and do something (readdir(3) and its ilk
are quite useful here) about it.
[Yes, I did work on some boxen where you could read directories, but with
 the current variety of filesystems (and corresponding directory formats!)
 in Linux this way lies utter madnes.]
