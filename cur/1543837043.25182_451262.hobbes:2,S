Actually I think the commit f74bf2e6b415588e562fdcfdd454d587eb33cd46
(Remove ->waiting member from struct request) is wrong, because
generic_ide_suspend() uses the end_of_io member of rq to pass the PM data
to ide_do_drive_cmd() where the pointer gets overwritten by &wait (must_wait
is "true", because action == ide_wait).  Previously &wait was stored in
rq->waiting and it didn't overwrite the PM data.
Haven't tested yet, though.
Greetings,
Rafael
