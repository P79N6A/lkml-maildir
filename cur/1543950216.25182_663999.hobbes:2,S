Hi Pierre and folks,
First of all, sorry the delay of this response, I was on vacation for
some weeks.
So, regarding the comments (thanks for all o them) in fact this missing
include is really not needed. So, this patch will be disconsidered when
I resent the series with corrections and comments suggested here.
BR,
Carlos.
