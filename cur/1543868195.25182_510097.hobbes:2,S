Right now aio_wq is not freezeable (PF_NOFREEZE).

For no particular reason.

No.  It would be wrong to do that, because TASK_TRACED tasks with frozen
parents cannot be frozen any further.

You are right, but this has never happened, AFAICS.

I don't think so.  If p hasn't got TIF_FREEZE set yet or it has already been
frozen, cancel_freezing(p) is a noop.
Alternatively, we can move the check into refrigerator(), like this:
