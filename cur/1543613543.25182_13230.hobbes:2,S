Thanks for the info. In that case I'll try to boot 17rc1 a few times more. I
never saw this with .16 nor the Mandrake default .8mdk10. I had trouble
getting the initrd working with .17rc1 (never succeeded), so I compiled ext3
and qla1280 statically as opposed to .16 where I had them as modules. I
don't know if that has anything to do with it.
The reiserfs incident is still a bit worrying...
