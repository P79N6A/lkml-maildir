Since this is pretty much stopping me cold, I looked into it some
more.  Running with only a single thread at a time causes no "hanging"
behavior, but each individual connection takes noticeably longer than
it does with a 2.0.36 machine.  Furthermore, having 2 threads running
is enough to trigger the sucking.  I wrapped the connect(), read(),
and close() calls in timers to see where the time was being spent, and
sure enough, there are several ~3 second pauses at various points.  Is
3 seconds a magic retry interval perhaps?
Here's a sample output for 6 connections with 2 threads.  Lines are
printed when sockets are closed, and times are in milliseconds.
FD  connect   read    read        close

So as not to burden people that don't care, tcpdumps of this session
can be found here:
Client - 
http://www.ranney.com/~mjr/pornucopia_tcpdump.txt
Server - 
http://www.ranney.com/~mjr/lisa_tcpdump.txt
The client is called pornucopia, running 2.2.1.  The server is called
lisa, running 2.0.36.  Both machines have 512MB of RAM and eepro100's
in FD mode.
