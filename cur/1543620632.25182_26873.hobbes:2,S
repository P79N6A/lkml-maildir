Yes and no.
I hope that the developers that I work enough with for it to matter tend
to be fairly good at keeping things separate (ie separate BK trees for
different development efforts etc), in which case it's not a big issue.
And yes, from at least one developer I have already done a partial pull,
ie taken only partial changes. In that case the changes I disagreed with
were at the end, so it was easy enough to just do a "bk pull" into
another tree, do a "bk undo", and only merge after that.
But I agree - if I end up having to do that more than occasionally, I'm
going to ask that developer to stop using bk at least as far as I'm
concerned (ie he can use bk for himself, but I wouldn't accept bk
patches from developers who cannot keep their stuff cleanly separated).
