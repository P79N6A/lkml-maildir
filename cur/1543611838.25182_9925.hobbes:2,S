A oops trace from quite a bit further back in my logs makes this
appear to be an instance of an already reported problem. I apologize
for overlooking this detail in my prior post:

I don't believe so. In my configuration, exim delivers to a file
through a procmail pipe, and to the best of my knowledge, mutt does
little more than monitor the files with poll or select, which should
not interfere with the completion of their operations. cron should be
entirely unrelated, as no mail-related activities are scheduled with it.
I suspect in the case I reported, the destruction of the devfsd thread
is responsible for the deadlocks.
Thanks,
Bill
