basically, ->futex_offset is not blindly trusted by the kernel either: 
it's simply used to calculate a "userspace pointer" value, which it then 
uses in a (secure) get_user() access, to do a FUTEX_WAKEUP. [Note that 
FUTEX_WAKEUP is already done at do_exit() time via the ->clear_child_tid 
userspace pointer.] All in one: this is totally safe.
The purpose of ->futex_offset is to not hardcode glibc's data structure 
layout into the kernel. Since 'clean up after locks' is a relatively 
rare operation, it was the prudent thing to do.
We could also have registered the futex_offset in the kernel itself, but 
I didnt do it that way because that would add another word to 
task_struct (for the sake of an operation that is rare), and it would 
also make the sys_set_robust_list() operation a bit more expensive. So I 
minimized the API to only take a single userspace pointer, which pointer 
points to the robust_list_head structure which contains all data to 
continue. That data is never trusted and is handled very carefully.
