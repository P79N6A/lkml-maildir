I know, we don't expect users to look in it.  But you can't expect a
handful of developers, only two of whom are paid to work on ALSA, to
track every distro's bugzilla either.  It's hard enough to keep up with
the ALSA bug tracker.
The best solution is for the distros to make sure to refer users with
ALSA problems to the ALSA bug tracker, and for the maintainers of the
distro bugzillas to properly forward bugs upstream, like Debian does.
