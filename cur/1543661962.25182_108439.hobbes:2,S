Hi all,
I have tried to run several IP Multicast applications (SDR, Vat,...)
with on 2.5 kernels (now running 2.5.59bk3) without succes. Same
applications appear to work on 2.4 kernels.
What seems to be happening is that the application binds to the lo
interface instead of eth0 so that no IGMP queries are send out on the
ethernet interface. I have a small application that tries to listen to
address 233.4.5.9 and here is /proc/net/igmp with and without the app  
running:
Withtout app running:
 Idx     Device    : Count Querier       Group    Users Timer    Reporter
 1       lo        :     0      V2
                                 010000E0     1 0:FFF779D7               0
 2       eth0      :     3      V2
                                 010000E0     1 0:400DA3C3               0
With app running:
 Idx     Device    : Count Querier       Group    Users Timer    Reporter
 1       lo        :     0      V2
                                 090504E9     1 1:00000C28               1 
                                 010000E0     1 0:FFF73910               0
 2       eth0      :     3      V2
                                 010000E0     1 0:400D62FC               0
Is there a known problem? Or should multicast applications be changed to
run on 2.5 kernels?
Thanks,
Niels
