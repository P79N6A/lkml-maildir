Yeah, it does that sometimes.  I don't think it's fixable within the scope
of checkpatch.  It needs to check whether some preceding printk which might
not even be in the patch has a \n:
	printk(KERN_ERR "foo");
	<100 lines of whatever>
+	printk("bar\n");
we're screwed...

I'd disagree with checkpatch there.  Again, it might be hard to fix.  Wanna
rename it to checkpatch-and-suggest-stuff-to-think-about.pl?

Yes.  When the symbol is defined in .S or vmlinux.lds we have
traditionally declared it in .c.
But why?  It _is_ a global symbol.  We might as well declare it in .h. 
That's consistent, and prevents duplicated declarations from popping up
later on.
