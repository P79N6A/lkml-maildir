Your patch is broken.  FWIW, there are several real issues:
	a) d_delete() being called too early in vfs_unlink().  Not a big
deal, it's easy to move outside of dget()/dput().  However, you _can't_
expect unlink() to make dentry negative.  It's always possible that it
will be left positive and unhashed - that's what we have to do if file
we are unlinking is opened.
	b) rm -rf expecting offsets in directory to stay stable after
unlink().  B0rken, complain to GNU folks.  Sorry, I'm not touching that
code - GNU fileutils source is too yucky.
	c) dcache_readdir() behaviour.  There was an old patch that makes
it slightly more forgiving; I'll dig it out.
