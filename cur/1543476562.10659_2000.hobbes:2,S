[sorry if this come multiple time. i don't see it when it posts!]
System Configuration:
Base Distribution: RedHat 5.2
Kernel: 2.2.0-pre5
Cyrix 6x86MX PR233 (VIA chipset board I think)
64MB RAM
2 EIDE UDMA drives (Quantuum, 4.3GB and 2.5GB)
ATAPI CDROM (TEAC)
Noname internal modem
DaynaPORT Ethernet (tulip driver used)
My network is set up as an ethernet of several mackines like Mac with the linux serving as router through a PPP link. I IP MASQ over the PPP and the Ethernet is obviously a private network. I'm having the proiblem with aliases on eth0 (ethernet) interface with 2.2.0-pre5. I had same problem with 2.1.129, which was why I originally upgraded kernel to latest. I had to hand patch the ip_masq.h to add the IP_MASQ_F_DLOOSE everyone saw as problem. I use 0x020 as value.
I tried to use linuxconf to add alias to eth0 (eth0:0) but it won't activate the aliases for me, claiming that the alias support isn't in the kernel. I can't find and pseudo item with /proc that say alias, so I'm no understanding what that's about. The kernel does have alias included, and I have tried this now with 3 different compiles of kernel, so I can't have messed it up all times! See bottom for relevant part of .config for kernel 2.2.0.
If I manual add the alias like this:
ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.2.105 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
route add -net 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0:0
the alias "work" i.e. I can run an apache web page from the alias and itr come up like expected.
The /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts shell items are using ifconfig and route too, except that it uses `linuxconf --hint ipalias` and that says there is an error when you use the linuxconf to adda lias. Mebbe linuxconf just needs an update? I dunno.
`netstat -rn`
...
192.168.2.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
192.168.2.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
192.168.2.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
...
Now, one of those is the real interface, a second one is usually there (probly a config oops somewhere) but the third is new. With 2.0.3x, this command would look more like:
...
192.168.2.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
192.168.2.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0:0
...
I found a later net-tools (1.49) and that helped with the ifconfig output (it now correctly shows the eth0:0 alias, but the default RH5.2 v1.46 didn't even show the alias at all).
I post tos ee if mebbe there is a problem (bug?) with something or if this is expected behaviour that its working!
Thanks,
   Scooby
