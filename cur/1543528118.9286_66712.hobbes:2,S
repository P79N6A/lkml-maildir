Actually, you can't really do much direct to
the chipset.  C-states and events, that's about
it.  No S-states (suspend), no device specific
stuff, no battery, no thermal, etc.  If you
recall, Linus started out doing a PIIX4-specific
driver some time ago and that code ended up being
merged into the current ACPI driver.
