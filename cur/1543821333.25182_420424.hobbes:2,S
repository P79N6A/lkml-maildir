These aren't oopses.  They do look similar, but slightly
different to the other report - your page count there is
off with the pixies, but its not as clear that its a single
bit error - yours are more like 0xfffe0000.  Quite strange.
You also have the odd high-32-bits-mirrors-low-32-bits in
page flags, both with one bit set.
Not sure XFS can be causing this (we don't touch page count
for regular file pages, and only touch PageUptodate in flags
IIRC, like most/all filesystems).
Were you also using NFS, as in the other report?
cheers.
