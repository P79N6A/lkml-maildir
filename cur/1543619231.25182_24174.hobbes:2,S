 The difficult part comes when slightly larger changesets are needed,
 just to make things compile again for some people.
 See yesterdays subsection changes from Keith I forwarded you for
 example. To me, it had looked fine, it had good discussion on
 l-k, and it solved a known problem. I was surprised you threw it
 back for more changes (but glad, I want the best solution too, and
 taking a quick glance to the mail I've not read yet, it looks like
 Keith has bettered his original solution).
 Most of the bits I've sent you so far have been "small stuff".
 And things will likely continue to be so. There are large chunks
 in my tree, but I've absolutely no intention of feeding you those.
 Things like the input layer/console layer reworking are the
 responsibility of $maintainer to push your way.
