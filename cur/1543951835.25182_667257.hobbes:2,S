It does not. But my C3 desc looks like this:
state3/desc:ACPI FFH INTEL MWAIT 0x50
What's the meaning of the last number?
I also have different latency and power:
state3/latency:162
state3/power:100

Ah. Didn't know that. I've confirmed this as the noise is there when booting with maxcpus.

For some value of insufficient. It is sub-optimal. I'm hoping there is a way to enter C3 in a pattern that avoids the noise and still gives a reduced power usage.
