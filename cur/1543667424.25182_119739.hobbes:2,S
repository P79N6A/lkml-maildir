Well, that is a minefield of subjective opinions. Yes, the distros merge
stuff back ... but there's not enough of it going on. RHAS and UL are
*massively* diverged. There are also changes that are in just about every
distro that aren't back in mainline. I fail to see the point of that ...
people complain about problems with things like O(1) scheduler, and yet
the distros all distribute it ... very odd.
The question of "what is mainline 2.4 for anyway" is becoming increasingly
interesting, especially as fewer people are using it. If there was more
of a common base between the distros, there would be IMHO less duplicated
work.

I'm not so worried about what Marcelo chooses to do with this particular
issue - that's his call. However, I'm extremely concerned by the general
"you should be using a vendor kernel" attitude.
