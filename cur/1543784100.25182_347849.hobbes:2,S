Answer:  depends on hardware.
For all hardware, the conditions that generate interrupts should be shut 
down, and then free_irq() is called after that.
Some hardware only needs per-port disable, or nothing besides clearing 
any commands, to ensure that interrupts from that hardware are disabled 
(this excludes shared interrupts, of course).
This logic is another reason why a driver author may choose to implement 
their own PCI ->remove() hook, rather than using the generic 
ata_pci_remove_one().  Eliminates the need for a ->host_stop() hook 
implementation, and allows one to perform tasks before calling 
free_irq(), as well as tasks after the call (normal ->host_stop stuff).
