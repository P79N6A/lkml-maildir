Is there a particular reason to choose '3' as the only compression
level? Should this perhaps be a per-superblock option instead?
Also, I thought I saw discussion about making the mutex and
stream per-superblock, but don't remember if the idea was discarded.
If it was, you might want to add it to the won't-happen list.
