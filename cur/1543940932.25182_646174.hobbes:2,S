One disadvantage of doing it in separate files, is no good way of
indexing the mounts.  The mount ID could be used, but it's not a very
meaningful thing outside the context of mount propagation.
And one advantage of doing it in a single file, is that namespace_sem
is held during the read, so that content is self-consistent (no mounts
are removed/added/moved in between).
IMO, the /proc/mounts format is quite readable, and this one doesn't
differ all that much.  Maybe we could add a header line like
/proc/slabinfo.  Or do the "name:value\n" thing but put all mounts
into a single file, like /proc/cpuinfo.
I don't have any strong preference, I'm OK, with the current format,
but if there are good reasons for another one, I'm willing to change
it around.

Explicitly document, that adding fields at the end is OK.  But I think
this is implicit in all of the multi-fields-per-line formats, and I'm
quite confident all sane parsers already ignore unknown junk at the
end of a line.

Yes.

Just to identify mount propagation relations in this file.  The
vfsmount pointer would be just as good, but we don't like to expose
things like that to userspace (and it would be hard to parse for
humans anyway).
> They are also signed, which seems inappropriate.
IDR ids are 'int' but they are always positive (AFAICT), but yeah,
maybe this is confusing.

OK.

Tried that but not easy, without removing some of the
microoptimizations in d_path(), which I'm not sure are really
important, but...

I think Ram chose a different convention in dentry_path() in order to
make sure, there was no space in the resulting path.  But spaces would
be escaped anyway, so this isn't really important.  So yes, this could
be fixed.

Possibly yes.  A good chunk of namespace.c could be surrounded by an
#ifdef, which would save even more, than was added by this particular
patch.
