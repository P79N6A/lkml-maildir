The point is that this is hard work, and not very interesting.
Commercial distro vendors pay people to do it.  If you want a similar
community effort, but you're not prepared to invest time, money, or
leadership, well, too bad.
And your desire for such a project to be "blessed" makes no sense.
Create your fork, maintain it, and see who else wants to use it.  If
it gets enough users and stays useful, I'm sure that it can be hosted
on kernel.org -- that's really the only kind of "blessing" that there
is.
Remember that the people who maintained 2.2 and 2.4 as "stable"
kernels volunteered to do it and put a *lot* of time into it.  It
didn't just magically happen.
