So to be sure I've got this right ... those modified driver
entry points change things as follows:
> +	int (*probe) (struct usb_interface *intf,
> +		      const struct usb_device_id *id);
  (a) the device (for urbs etc) is now implicit:
        struct usb_device *dev = interface_to_usbdev (int):
  (b) the interface index should no longer matter
  (c) returns 0 (not void *) or -Errno (not null)
  (d) that void * handle is explicitly intf->dev.driver_data
> +	void (*disconnect) (struct usb_interface *intf);
   (a) and (d) above: same change
Makes me wonder about intf->private_data, which was the
original version of intf->dev.driver_data.  Shouldn't that
be removed too?  It's only used in the interface claiming
calls (shouldn't they fit in with the driver model?) and
usbfs just now.  Is that the usbfs work you mentioned?
