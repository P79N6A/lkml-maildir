That, and sg->length > PAGE_SIZE. On highmem systems this causes all
kinds of funky behaviour. Usually just bogus data in the buffers though.

The background wasn't really detailed on LKML anyway. The background was
that I got several reports of very strange behaviour, all from people
running highmem systems. When debug messages were added, printing the sg
structure entries, we discovered that the problems seemed to occur when
we were crossing pages.
