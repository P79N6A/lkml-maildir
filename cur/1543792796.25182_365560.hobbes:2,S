Yes, spose so.

yes, with either approach it remans the case that someone could write some
code which works just fine on their setup but explodes gorridly fomr
someone else who has a different config/arch which has a larger spinlock_t.

Well plan B is to kill spinlock_t.break_lock.  That fixes everything and
has obvious beneficial side-effects.
a) x86 spinlock_t is but one byte.  Can we stuff break_lock into the
   same word?
   (Yes, there's also a >128 CPUs spinlock overflow problem to solve,
   but perhaps we can use lock;addw?)
b) Redesign the code somehow.  Currently break_lock means "there's
   someone waiting for this lock".
   But if we were to leave the lock in a decremented state while
   spinning (as we've always done), that info is still present via the
   value of spinlock_t.slock.   Hence: bye-bye break_lock.
c) Make the break_lock stuff a new config option,
   CONFIG_SUPER_LOW_LATENCY_BLOATS_STRUCT_PAGE.
d) Revert it wholesale, have sucky SMP worst-case latency ;)
