proc_info_read() (in fs/proc/base.c) uses this macro to limit the size
of a single read:
#define PROC_BLOCK_SIZE (3*1024)                /* 4K page size but our output 
routines use some slack for overruns */
It seems to me like it's a legacy from array_read() in 2.2.x and can be
safely removed.  Besides an outdated assumption about the page size,
the value is not passed down to (*proc_read)(), so it cannot guard
against any overruns, and serves no useful purpose.
Am I missing anything?
(This is not to be confused with PROC_BLOCK_SIZE in fs/proc/generic.c)
The reason it bothers me is that if you have a process with a really long
command line, then /proc/<pid>/cmdline "contains" up to PAGE_SIZE bytes,
but sys_read() only returns 3072, and needs to be called repeatedly.
