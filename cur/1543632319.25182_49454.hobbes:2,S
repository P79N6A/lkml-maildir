When the pci hotplug core sees a new device it calls out to
/sbin/hotplug to load any available driver (if necessary).  So if you
later plug in the device, everything will work just fine.
Well, that's the way it's _supposed_ to work, but the pci core changes
in 2.5.19 seem to have broken this too :(
/me looks for Pat Mochel...
