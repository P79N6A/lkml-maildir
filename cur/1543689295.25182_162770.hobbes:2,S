That's where I disagree - it's much easier for the USER because an SSI
cluster works out all the load balancing shit for itself, instead of
pushing the problem out to userspace. It's much harder for the KERNEL
programmer, sure ... but we're smart ;-) And I'd rather solve it once,
properly, in the right place where all the right data is about all
the apps running on the system, and the data about the machine hardware.

Same problem as any clustered fs, but yes, truncate will suck harder
than it does now. Not sure I care though ;-) Invalidations on write,
etc will be more expensive when we're sharing files across nodes, but
independant operations will be cheaper due to the locality. It's a 
tradeoff - whether it pays off or not depends on the workload.

Well, if you mean "task" in the linux sense (ie not a multi-threaded
process), that reduces us from worrying about tasks to memory. On an
SSI cluster that's on a NUMA machine, we could loan memory across nodes
or something, but yes, that's definitely a problem area. It ain't no
panacea ;-)
