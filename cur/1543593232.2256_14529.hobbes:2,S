For some time I've been trying to make a simple, yet functional web
page to put some stuff there. But, HTML hacking and kernel hacking are
such a different beasts... :)
XMM is heavily modified XMEM utility that shows graphically size of
different Linux page lists: active, inactive_dirty, inactive_clean,
code, free and swap usage. It is better suited for the monitoring of
Linux 2.4 MM implementation than original (XMEM) utility.

P.S. I'm gladly accepting suggestion for a simple tool that would help
in static web site creation/development. I checked genpage, htmlmake
and some other utilities but in every of them I found something that I
didn't like. Tough job, that HTML authoring.
