Mark,
Generally I agree with your ideas on what needs fixing up, but I'm 
concerned that the run-time binding of this kind of design would have 
too much overhead for time-critical code paths.  Do you think it is 
useful to have run-time selection of the time base and interrupt source? 
   In my work we have a known fixed hardware configuration that has 
limited timers, so I don't really see a need for runtime configuration 
there.
