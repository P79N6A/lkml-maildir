Disagreed about `enabling'.

How do you want this to happen ? Could you elaborate.

Yes, it is expected to do its work (e.g. assigning ressources to all
agents on the BUS hierachy).

I disagree 100% with this statement. The genericity of PCI configuration
is only here to facilitate configuration of all the devices on a BUS
hierarchy. Indeed a PCI device driver must not tamper the resources the
device got from the generic PCI layer. But it is expected to know better
about the PCI devices it supports that any generic PCI layer. Not
everything are generic in PCI. What about device bugs, for example? About
bridges, part of their configuration can be handled generically, but not
everything. The generic PCI layer that deals with bridges have to know
bridge quirks and special features as you know. In some way, the PCI
generic layer acts as PCI device drivers for the bridges. Configuring and
enabling are 2 different issues. Configuring has been designed to be
generic in PCI but the `enabling' should be performed by the entity that
knows the best about the real device, thus the PCI device driver.
