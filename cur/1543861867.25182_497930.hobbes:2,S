An updated patch is available from git, and applies against netdev-2.6's upstream branch 
(as of commit 77aab8bf22042d1658d4adbca8b71779e7f2d0ff )
     git-pull git://lost.foo-projects.org/~ahkok/git/netdev-2.6 e1000
Again, also available per http:
     
http://foo-projects.org/~sofar/e1000_hw_init_layer_rewrite-v2-upstream.patch
     
http://foo-projects.org/~sofar/e1000_hw_init_layer_rewrite-v2-upstream.patch.bz2
This version contains a few minor adjustments and updates to the one posted earlier this 
morning (and replaces that patch):
1) 82541 bitmask issue
2) 80003es2lan timeout value fix
3) added some more kdoc headers to functions
4) removed #ifdef NETIF_F_TSO6 forgotten by cleanup patch
I hope this patch works for everyone, please let me know if there are still problems.
Cheers,
Auke
