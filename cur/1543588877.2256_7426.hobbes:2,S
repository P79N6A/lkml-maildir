While I applaud your initiative, you made an unfortunate choice of
filesystems to convert.  The iso_inode_info is only 4*__u32, as is
proc_inode_info.  Given that we still need to keep a pointer to the
external info structs, and the overhead of the slab cache itself
(both CPU usage and memory overhead, however small), I don't think
it is worthwhile to have isofs and procfs in separate slabs.
On the other hand, sockets and shmem are both relatively large...
Watch out that the *_inode_info structs have all of the fields
initialized, because the union field is zeroed for us, but slab is not.
Cheers, Andreas
