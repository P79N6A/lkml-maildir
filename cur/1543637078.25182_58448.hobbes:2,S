Don't know, but in the process of compiling a 2.5.27 kernel with ALL
options enabled I have found not less than 60 compilation bugs. Expect
run-time problems to be much more than compile-time problems. Moreover,
problems can happen on several kernel versions (untill they are solved),
so the page can quickly get out of control.
I would suggest categorizing reported bugs to get a smaller front-page,
maybe with a back-end database to store and keep track of bugs.
Just an opinion :)
