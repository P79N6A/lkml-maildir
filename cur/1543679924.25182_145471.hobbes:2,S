Have you taken the next twist in the road? I posted a second patch which 
should go on top of what's in 2.5.74-mm1 a couple of days ago. Just in case, 
here is a link to it.
http://kernel.kolivas.org/2.5/
it's called patch-O2int-0307041440
It makes significant headway in smoothing the corner cases. I need testing at 
each point before I can post another update, and am doing much less frequent 
smaller updates now, with the aim of having no more than one patch for each 
-mm, so I can have a decent sized audience for each change.
Andrew can you please apply this one on top in the next -mm if you are to 
continue testing this patch series.
