All right. Tomorrow I will try to find the time to file a bug.

But wait, I do not think this is really a relevant bug. It happens only
if I tart cardmgr, which is supposed it's not needed for newer kernels.
The problem here (as I stated in another mail in this thread) is that it
seems that the new pccardctl infrastructure miss the second function of
my card, registering and initialiazng just the first one.

Uf. This will be at least six month. I really need my modem before than
that :-). I have an old external Robotics one, but well, it's a bit, you
know, big... I will try a newer kernel, I think that my problem is
simply that in ubuntu kernel all is modular, and make install do not
generate a initrd by default.

Will try. If anyone can suggest a recipe before I test zillions of
reboots, it will be very welcome.
