The other cpu writes the dirty bit - we just overwrite it ;-)
After the ptep_get_and_clear(), before the set_pte().
The current assumption about the page dirty logic is:
A cpu that has a writable, non-dirty pte cached in its tlb it may
unconditionally set the dirty bit - without honoring present or write
protected bits.
--> set_pte() can either loose a dirty bit or a 'pte_none() entry' could
suddenly become a swap entry unless it's guaranteed that no cpus has a
cached valid tlb entry.
Linus, does the proposed pte gather code handle the second part?
pte_none() suddenly becomes 0x0040.
Back to the current mprotect.c code:
pte is writable, not-dirty.
cpu1:
has a writable, non-dirty pte in it's tlb.
		cpu 2: in mprotect.c
	        entry = ptep_get_and_clear(pte);
		* pte now clear.
		* entry contains the pte value without
		  the dirty bit
cpu decodes a write instruction, and dirties the pte.
lock; orl DIRTY_BIT, *pte
	        set_pte(pte, pte_modify(entry, newprot));
		* pte overwritten with entry.
--> dirty bit lost.
