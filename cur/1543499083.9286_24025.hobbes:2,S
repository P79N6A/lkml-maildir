Anything that should lead to namespace changes on the lower layers gets
-EROFS. There is no way to make underlying files in a directory move
together with it (well, there is, but it means copying). Maybe more
reasonable approach for directories would be -EXDEV - that way userspace
utilities would be forced to make copy/remove thing. But I'm not sure that
it's the right thing to do.
