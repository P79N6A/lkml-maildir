the commit below is the only autofs4 patch that went into the git tree 
since 2.6.22.
Does reverting it fix your problems?

commit 1864f7bd58351732593def024e73eca1f75bc352
Author: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>

    autofs4: deadlock during create
    Due to inconsistent locking in the VFS between calls to lookup and
    revalidate deadlock can occur in the automounter.
    The inconsistency is that the directory inode mutex is held for both lookup
    and revalidate calls when called via lookup_hash whereas it is held only
    for lookup during a path walk.  Consequently, if the mutex is held during a
    call to revalidate autofs4 can't release the mutex to callback the daemon
    as it can't know whether it owns the mutex.
    This situation happens when a process tries to create a directory within an
    automount and a second process also tries to create the same directory
    between the lookup and the mkdir.  Since the first process has dropped the
    mutex for the daemon callback, the second process takes it during
    revalidate leading to deadlock between the autofs daemon and the second
    process when the daemon tries to create the mount point directory.
    After spending quite a bit of time trying to resolve this on more than one
    occassion, using rather complex and ulgy approaches, it turns out that just
    delaying the hashing of the dentry until the create operation works fine.
