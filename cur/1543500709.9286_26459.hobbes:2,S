Hang on a minute.  If those were just spin_lock then OK, ignore for
SMP.  But they are spin_lock_irq which implies the protected code is
entered from irq as well as normal kernel.  If so, then the locks are
still needed, even on UP.
I tried to trace the call tree down to get_next_mport.  AFAICT, it goes
get_next_mport <- ip_masq_new <- ip_masq_mod_out_create <-
ip_fw_masquerade <- ip_forward.  If any of those are called from an
irq, then the lock is still required on UP.  Otherwise it should be
spin_lock().
