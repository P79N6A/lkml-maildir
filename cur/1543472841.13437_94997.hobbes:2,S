  Hi, all. Version 82 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
NOTE: it may not be obvious from my terse ChangeLog, but devfs now
supports automatic checking for partitions on removable media. This
means that after a media change, if you list the parent directory
which has the device with removable media, or you attempt to access a
partition which didn't exist before, a partition check is triggered
and the changed device nodes will magically appear.
This is against 2.1.132. Highlights of this release:
- Ported to kernel 2.1.132-pre4
- Changed initial permissions on /dev/pts/*
- Created <devfs_mk_compat>
- Added "symlinks" boot option
- Changed devfs_register_blkdev() back to register_blkdev() for IDE
- Check for partitions on removable media in <devfs_lookup>
				Regards,
					Richard....
