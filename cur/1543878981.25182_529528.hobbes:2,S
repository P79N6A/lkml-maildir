If the goal is to hide from /sbin/init.  We don't need to touch
kernel/kthread.c or 
kernel/stop_machine.c
Their parents are already kernel threads.
Yes. There is a startup issue for kernel/kthread.c I just about have
a patch I can stand that addresses that issue.
For the kernel thread they all inherit signals with SIGCHLD set to
SIG_IGN, so there is child auto reaping in that form.  Adding
the ->exit_signal = -1 would be a bonus but is not required.
I am a little concerned with removing the knowledge of who our
real parent is as that may compromise debugging.  The reason
why kernel threads are visible in the first place.
I do support reparenting kernel threads that call daemonize,
and the modifications to reparent_kthread here look reasonable.
