Well, the computer must have been listening.  Not an hour after I posted
this, I was untarring two largish files simultaneously when a complete
machine lockup happened on the P166!  No response to any stimulus, and the
SCSI activity LED was stuck on.  Magic sysreq didn't work...  Red button +
reboot + (looonnngg) fsck :-(.
The actual work was being done on an NFS client which mounts the P166 as
server.
