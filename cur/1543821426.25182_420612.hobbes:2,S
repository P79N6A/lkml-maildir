The Kconfig files has lots of nice operators.
Anyway, until we actually have the cell common hypervisor interface
out in the public adding any support for it in Kconfig or the
Makefile is completely pointless, and a patch like this even when
done correctly shouldn't go in.

That's wrong.  Most of these files will be needed to support
the PS3 when running on bare hardware.  The right option will
be CELL_SPIDER_HARDWARE, which is right now the only cell
hardware generation supported.  It'll become meaningfull when
adding axon support.
