Hmm, you are right that with dead nfs server, kill -SIGSTOP will fail
on ls, and similary current refrigerator will fail. I think we can
live with that.
I agree that two-stage suspend is probably neccessary (userland first,
kernel than); but that should be possible without that big changes,
right?

Your solution is more reliable, thats right.
