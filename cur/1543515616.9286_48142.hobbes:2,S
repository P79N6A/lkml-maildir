Other information that wasn't apparent when I fired off the earlier note.
The xntpd process died, but left UDP socket 123 occupied: when I shut down
the machine to reboot, there was a message to the effect of "VM swap"
complaining about the remnants of the process.  Also, the rc5des-related
oops happened about six hours after the xntpd-related oops: as with xntpd,
a remnant of the rc5des process was left hanging around (the foreground
process connected to the terminal).  When I interrupted it to restart it,
it seg-faulted.
Hope this is helpful.
