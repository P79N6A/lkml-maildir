It doesn't matter a great deal, but leaving it as lookup_swap_cache
would be correct - the difference lies solely in the swap cache "find"
statistics shown by AltSysRqM, which find_get_page shortcircuited
(whereas "add" and "delete" were getting updated for mm/shmem.c).
lookup_swap_cache is itself patched to say find_pagecache_page instead
of find_get_page - though why an -rmap patch should be changing that
well-established name escapes me: makes maintenance more tiresome.
