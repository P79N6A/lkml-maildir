Dave Woodhouse asked me to review the hdrinstall part and I will do so.
At first glance only a fiw tid-bits needs fixing and then I like to
include unifdef in the kernel. It is rather unusual to have installed
(gentoo at least does not have it in Portage).
I just lacks a bit of time. Work and my newcomer (2 months old now)
takes a bit of time at the moment.
I you do not beat me hdrinstall will be part of kbuild-tree soon,
whereas the hrdcleanup part will not.
Following will be in kbuild-tree soon too.

Not this one >>> sane-menuconfig-colours.patch
Randy Dunlap has a patch so it is configurable - but I like it
selectable in menuconfig - something I have not yet done.

If review is good => kbuild-tree.

I need to check up on this.

I thought we had a kernel-doc maintainer these days?
