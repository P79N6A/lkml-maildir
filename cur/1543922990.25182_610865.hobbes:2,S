Hi,
I cannot boot above kernel when I *disable* swncq support which got added in 
sata_nv. Problem seems that some component thinks driver is in ncq mode while 
it is not, as I see a queue depth of 31 instead of 0 on boot., ie I see 
something like this:
ata1.00: 625142448 sectors, multi 1: LBA48 NCQ (depth 31/32)
though I disabled ncq.And then boot "hangs" at
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] 625142448 512-byte hardware sectors (320073 MB)
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Write Protect is off
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Mode Sense: 00 3a 00 00
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Write cache: enabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support 
DPO or FUA
 sda
while detecting partitions I guess. (Note, the boot messages are from ncq 
enabled kernel, but look alike, at least regarding queue depth...) The kernel 
doesn't really hang but tries detecting something while spitting out some 
errors. I simply wasn't patient enough.
Anyway, I tried 2.6.23 with swncq patch on top, and here I don't have any 
problems with swncq or w/o it. (NCQ depth also gets correctly reported). I 
diffed the 2.6.23 patched driver with git one and they are nearly identical 
excpet some ID changes, whcih don't affect me, es I have a MCP51 chipset. So 
something in libata changed and got broken or sata_nv wasn't adopted for that 
change.
HTH,
