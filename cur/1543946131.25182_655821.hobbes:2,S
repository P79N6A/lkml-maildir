You should at least be able to read from it without crashing the
machine. Of course writing is a different story.

You mean, having a complete database for the, what, 4000 PC
motherboards out there? And maintaining it day after day? _This_ sounds
much scarier to me than the current situation.

I don't remember anyone reporting problems with this in the past 3 or 4
years, so it doesn't seem to be a big problem in practice.

I am surprised that anyone would actually run sensors-detect on
non-x86... Non-PC hardware usually doesn't have sensors driven by
"hwmon" drivers anyway, or people know what they have and do not need
detection. But I would be totally fine with updating sensors-detect to
skip some of the probes on non-x86 hardware. There are basically
3 /dev/port probes that are done currently:
* Super-I/O chips at 0x2e/0x2f and 0x4e/0x4f.
* Legacy PC hardware monitoring chips at 0x290-0x297.
* IPMI interface at 0x0ca3 and 0x0cab (read-only).
Please tell me which ones should be skipped on PowerPC.
Christian, can you tell me which of these probes caused trouble for you?

The same could be done for user-space (or at the /dev/port level.)
