Subject: An offer related to the the ongoing albod issue
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I may regret making this offer <g>, but what the heck...
Would it be useful for the current discussion of albods or 
compound documents or file conglomerations or whatever
we're calling it this half-hour, to have someone organize a
design document that directly addresses what is and isn't
included, what the expected benefits to users and programmers
will be, etc.?
In watching this discussion, I'm seeing a lot of great ideas 
flying about, but people seem to be making many assumptions 
about what is and isn't desirable in the implementation.  I think 
that for a change of this magnitude to Linux, it might be helpful 
to have some of the decisions and the rationale behind them
documented.  If nothing else, it might be a useful experiment to 
try to extend the distributed development model to include explicit 
requirements definition and/or design processes for more complex 
projects.
If the developers want to try this, I'll volunteer to be the document
administrator, and I'll post the doc. on my web site.  I'll also want to 
contribute to the effort, since I think it's an interesting and important
project, in the form of making suggestions, raising questions, and
helping make sure that the issues people raise get addressed, even
if the answer is "go away, we're not going to bother with that now".
I'll gladly leave the actual design and implementation to the kernel 
developers.
(Since I'm relatively new to the list, let me introduce myself.  I've 
been a programmer for nearly 20 years, including a long stint at 
IBM in operating systems design, and I've been a technical writer 
in the computer field since 1993.  Search the net for "lou grinzo" to
see some of my published work at DDJ and other places.
In case there's any doubt, my sole intention is to contribute to the
project in a meaningful way.  This is not connected with any writing
project I'm working on now, although I might want to write about the
experience in the future, if we try this little experiment.)
