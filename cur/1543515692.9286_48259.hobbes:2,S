That sounds like a statement, not a question.  :-)

We (Red Hat) did not include apm in our default kernels until there was
a way to disable it on the kernel command line.  Just use "apm=off".
For what it's worth, a search for "apm" in our knowledgebase finds that
information.  Unfortunately, Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt does
not list the possible values, so you couldn't have found it there.
However, arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:apm_setup() is where the parsing is
done.
Hope that helps,
