Hey, I heard that before when I was still doing non-Intel platform
development.  "Why do you care that all of your friends start using
Windows. Just do your own stuff and ignore everything else".
You actually might want to consider caring what the people around you
do and use because at one point it might affect you and then you can
only look back and say "if I'd only known that two years ago, I'd be
able to make a change". [1]
No, I won't pull any political or historical references in here at
that point. That's for everyone else to do. 
	Regards

[1] Ok, I couldn't resist. For the germans in the audience: If we'd
only known on 9/22 what we know now...
