Just tried 2.4.0-prerelease on my workstation at work (hmm, totally new
meaning of "workstation"...).  It's a no-name dual Pentium-II (300) with
a Tyan Tiger 2 board.  Also i have "ACPI-aware OS" enabled in BIOS, the
kernel states:
  ACPI: System description tables not found
Any idea how to proceed? Obviously there should be some ACPI tables
somewhere.  Since this is my personal workstation (apart from being our
MP2 server as well) i can test at will.
