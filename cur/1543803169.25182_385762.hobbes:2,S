Could we get for each of these and a mutex:
 - description 
 - common use case
 - small argument why this and nothing else should be used there
This would help driver writers a lot deciding what to use when, I think.
PS: After reading the Linux Kernel one could write a PhD thesis
    just containing explanations, examples and measurements
    of sychronization primitives, since Linux implements at least 
    most of them AFAIK :-)
Thanks & Regards
