Subject: [bug?] return from suspend puts you at vc/1 always and X crashes

Was this an intentional change?  Starting with the late test7 series,
waking up a sleeping laptop puts you on tty1 (vc/1 for us devfs peeps).
On a probably related note, X started crashing at resume at the exact
same time.
I'll be debugging X as soon as I get that annoying broken pcmcia working
enough to use again.  The pegasus driver is nice, but requires setting
up networking again after you resume which with a broken X makes it
impossible.  I suspect X doesn't like having the console ripped away
from it unexpectedly.
