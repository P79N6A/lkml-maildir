Automatic IP config using bootp doesn't work in 2.3.46. The IP-Config
code is called before PCI network cards are initialized. From the boot
message:
...
FDC 0 is a post-191 82077
IP-Config: Entered.
IP-Config: No network devices available.

I couldn't find where the PCI network cards were initialized in the
new kernel. They don't seem to be initialized in net_dev_init, but
later.
