Hello
    I am using two Intel Giga NICs in a DELL PowerEdge 4600
    with 2 Intel XEON 1.8GHz CPUs.
    The matherboard is ServerWorks GC-HE.
    The OS is RedHat 7.2, and the release of kernel is "2.4.7-10smp".
    The CPU0 has very heavy interrupt traffic,
    you can see the following information:
>>>>>
[root@giga root]# cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:     395117          0    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:        653          0    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:          1          0    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
 12:         23          0    IO-APIC-edge  PS/2 Mouse
 14:          2          0    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 18:         30          0   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx

 20:      10394          0   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
 21:         30          0   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
 27:    5480873          0   IO-APIC-level  e1000

    The kernel's SMP option is enable, but the CPU1 is always idle.
    How to balance the interrpupts between two CPUs?
    If you are convenient, please give me some advice quickly.
    Thank you!
Best regard
