Who said that NT with NTFS recovers fast from corruptions ?
Who said is fscks ( chkdsk actually ) fast on boot ?
I don't know what setup they are using , but on a NT4SP4 box here
a chkdsk lasts just as long as it would a fsck on ext2.
It is several minutes for a 2G (1400MB used) partition.
Maybe it is a bit faster than ext2 , but still not something
like : "NTFS is journalled so it recovers fast after crash ...".
I just had to let some steam off ...
