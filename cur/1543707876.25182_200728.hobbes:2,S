what i propose is a pretty generic feature that we need anyway (current
32-bit, 1-sec granular mtime in most filesystems is already problematic
for things like make dependencies), while "use JFS in case-insensitive
mode" is to degrade a filesystem to a non-POSIX mode. I dont think the
two approaches are equivalent. Having good, monotonic, finegrained
timestamps is a thing of the future - case-insensitive lowlevel
filesystems are a thing of the past.
