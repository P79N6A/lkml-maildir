Actually %Ld is completely wrong.  I know in the kernel it makes no 
difference but people see it in the kernel and then go off an use it in 
userspace and it generates junk output on at least some architectures.  
This is because %L means "long double (floating point)" not "long long 
integer" and when you stuff an integer into it it goes wrong (on some 
architectures)...  From the printf(3) man page:
ll     (ell-ell).   A  following integer conversion corre­
       sponds to a long long int or unsigned long long int
       argument,  or  a following n conversion corresponds
       to a pointer to a long long int argument.
L      A following a, A, e, E, f, F, g,  or  G  conversion
       corresponds to a long double argument.  (C99 allows
       %LF, but SUSv2 does not.)
