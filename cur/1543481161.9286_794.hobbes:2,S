I prefer "multiprocessor" to "advanced", since it's simpler to focus on,
albeit inadequately correct.

Nice. Drop "traditional". Say "the hallmark"(s).

Drop "available for perusal.. ". Just give the url as a reference.
In parens is fine.  A footnote is also fine.

No - it's very good. Excellent. Well done. Reference the bazaar paper,

It's not so bad.  You can drop the command line bit - in fact you can
drop it all.  You're trying to say that for the home and office user,
Linux nowadays comes ready to go with GUIs that extend the desktop
metaphor with drag 'n drop architectures and seamless network
access.
