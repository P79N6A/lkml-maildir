Do you expect to see slowdowns by just enabling large packet receives,
or just when you actually receive a large packet?

The subtle difference is that we want to be able to have an MTU 4 bytes
bigger than the VLAN device's MTU, but we most likely do NOT want
the rest of the stack to know we are using the higher MTU, because
then non-vlan packets may not be accepted at the other end.  In
other words, we want eth0's MTU to be 1500, and VLAN1's MTU to be
1500, as far as the layer 3 stacks are concerned.  However, eth0
must really be able to handle a packet of 1504 length.

That will be a very welcome development!
