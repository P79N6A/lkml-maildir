	Yes, as I said, it's nit-picking.  It's a matter of the directory
structure, device-type (/dev/ide/cd) vs. device-location (/dev/ide#/master).
Perhaps I'm missing the point on what Ted was saying, but if changing that
will move devfs closer to being in the mainstream kernel, I'm all for it. :)
	In a way, /dev/ide/cd is kind of half-and-half.  That does kind of
worry me, I would think one or the other would make sense.  That would mean
something like /dev/cd/...  Which makes more sense, all CD drives on a
system in one place.  That of course causes a problem with what do you name
it when you have different controller types (IDE vs. SCSI).  I would suppose
you could have c0/c1 be ide0/ide1, then c2+ be scsi, but that is obviously
ugly and going the wrong direction.
	Unless /dev/cd was just a bunch of symlinks back to the actual
location of each CD drive.  I wouldn't use a /dev/cd/* name in my fstab,
personally, but that'd allow easy searching through of all CD drives in a
system.
