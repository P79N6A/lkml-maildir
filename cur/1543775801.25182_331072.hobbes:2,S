Done.
Can you check if there is a regression in sis190-000.patch available at
http://www.zoreil.com/~romieu/sis190/20050704-2.6.13-rc1/patches
 ?
If it works and you want some entertainment, you can apply sis190-010.patch
+ sis190-020.patch and experience with ethtool/mii-tool. 
There is a tarball as well:
