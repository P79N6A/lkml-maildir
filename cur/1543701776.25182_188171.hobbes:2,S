Yes, file->f_mode can be hijacked for this. Only 2 bits of it are used at the
moment. More headache is clearing this state again, but this might not be
necessary, since we can always return EAGAIN, if the cache is stale,
right?

This is true. But old software continues to exist and for INN there is
pretty much nothing else in this category available, I've been told by
several admins. Nobody really likes it, but it is used and improved
where necessary (epoll might be on the list already).
