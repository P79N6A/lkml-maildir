Linus, This is actually something I sent to Martin (and DaveM).  The __UID16
crap is because s390x and Sparc64 (and others?) do not want the highuid
stuff except in very specific places - namely compat code.  Just using
CONFIG_UID16_SYSCALLS has the same bad side-effect as CONFIG_UID16 - all or
nothing.  In short, we want to build uid16.o with highuid translations, and
a few other compat objects, but not everything.  Ugly.
I wasn't aware Martin had tried to push this one quite yet.  Have a
preferred solution?  I'd already passed this by DaveM and he said the fun
would be getting it past you :)
