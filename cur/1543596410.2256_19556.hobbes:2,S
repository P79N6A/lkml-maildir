I've always thought it would be neat to do:
	cat bzImage initrd.tar.gz > vmlinuz
	rdev --i-have-a-tarball-piggyback vmlinuz
Linking into the image is easy for hackers, but why not make it
scriptable and super-easy for end users?  x86 already has the rdev
utility to mark a kernel image as having certain flags.  It could even
be a command line option, "inittgz" or somesuch, telling us that a
gzip-format tarball immediately follows the end of our ELF image.
I wonder if any bootloader mods would be needed at all to do this... 
AFAICS you just need to make sure the kernel doesn't trample the
piggyback'd data.
