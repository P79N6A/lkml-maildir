On some architectures, kernel and user space are separate, overlapping 
address spaces.
If __bitmap_parse was an inline (and not exported), this would be okay; 
as it is, you end up doing the test dynamically under all circumstances, 
even though in most (if not all) cases the address space is know a priori.
