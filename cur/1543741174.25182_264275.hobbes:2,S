Currently, the default does nothing (doesn't even save/restore). It
would be nice if it did though, in absence of a driver, eventually with
a quirk call, so we can add "workarounds" for things like the S3 without
having a full pci_driver for it (it may well be using vgacon).

Apple in Darwin doesn't quite bother apparently... If there is more to
save/restore, it's expected that you have a driver doing it, however,
they definitely do have the default save/restore P2P bridges. In fact,
they even (and I'll need that for pmac too), have a separate "hook" that
allow restoring all P2P bridges outside of the normal loop which is to
be called by the arch code early during resume. Can be necessary to
access some on-board things like the ACPI controller I suppose, on
pmacs, it's for accessing the "mac-io" IO chip early during resume to
re-enable various clocks.

Ok, I don't know about that one.

Agreed. However, my concern is to have some "default" stuff that will
take over in absence of a driver. This is, I think, important for things
like P2P bridges which are rather standard and will usually survive well
with a simple save/retore of whatever is there. I suppose it would be
interesting to define a pair of quirk types to hook on the "default"
implementation, unless we actually want to have a bunch of pci_driver's
just for things that don't have normally a driver but need some specific
save/restore procedure ...
Ben.
