Well, after using tons of printk's I found that the following is 
happening:
 - irqs get enabled, and the timer interrupt gets handled,
 - arch/i386/kernel/timer.c::timer_interrupt gets called,
 - which in turn calls cur_timer->mark_offset(), which is
 - arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_pm.c::mark_offset_pmtmr(), where we 
   finally arrive to:
        /* compensate for lost ticks */
        if (lost >= 2)
                jiffies_64 += lost - 1;
So no irq storm here, everything works as it should, the jiffies gets 
updated as it should, that's why it _seems_ from printk's that it takes 
long. (And only 1 irq happens.)
The main question though remains: what takes up seconds on the kernel 
boot, and why is it so undeterministic how long it takes (sometimes just 
0.3s, sometimes even 3s)? (Something before timers get enabled.)
