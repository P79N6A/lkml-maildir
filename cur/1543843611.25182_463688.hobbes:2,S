This is so true (and the main reason we implemented a trace utility in 
SystemTap).
Several of the people that work with in my team are _not_ kernel 
developers.  They do not necessarily know the Linux kernel code enough 
to insert their own instrumentation.  On the other had, they do posses 
other very good knowledges about things specific to a particular 
software stack or a HW subsystem.  Structured predefined probe points 
(dynamic or static) allow people with limited  kernel hacking skills to 
feedback useful information back to developers of the kernel.
I agree with Karim that a trace tool (while useful to developers) is 
mostly targeted at a non kernel developer audience.  They are mostly 
meant to enhance the communication between developers and regular 
users.  Any solution that is intended to be dynamic replacement for 
LTTng needs to take these kinds of users into account.
