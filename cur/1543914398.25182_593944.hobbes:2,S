I think it shouldn't - this change will almost certainly cause a regression.
There is a lot of system devices besides the host bridges that shouldn't be
disabled during BAR probe, like interrupt controllers, power management
controllers and so on.
We need a more sophisticated fix - I'm thinking of introducing "probe" field
in struct pci_dev which can be set by "early" quirk routines.
