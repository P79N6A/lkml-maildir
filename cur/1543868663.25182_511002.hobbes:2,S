Subject: [PATCH 2/3] UML - Host VDSO fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/20/219

This fixes a problem seen by a number of people running UML on newer
host kernels.  init would hang with an infinite segfault loop.
It turns out that the host kernel was providing a AT_SYSINFO_EHDR of
0xffffe000, which faked UML into believing that the host VDSO page
could be reused.  However, AT_SYSINFO pointed into the middle of the
address space, and was unmapped as a result.  Because UML was
providing AT_SYSINFO_EHDR and AT_SYSINFO to its own processes, these
would branch to nowhere when trying to use the VDSO.
The fix is to also check the location of AT_SYSINFO when deciding
whether to use the host's VDSO.
