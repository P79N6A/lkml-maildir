In the old scheme, each type required you to change crypto_tfm
and crypto_alg since they had the type-specific information
embedded in it.  Starting with crypto_shash, we are now totally
decentralised.  All type-specific information is now added to
the base structures.  Let's take shash_alg as an example, in
the old days we'd put the algorithms into a structure and embed
the structure in crypto_alg, now we instead put crypto_alg in
shash_alg, like this:
struct shash_alg {
	int (*init)(struct shash_desc *desc);
	int (*reinit)(struct shash_desc *desc);
	int (*update)(struct shash_desc *desc, const u8 *data,
		      unsigned int len);
	int (*final)(struct shash_desc *desc, u8 *out);
	int (*finup)(struct shash_desc *desc, const u8 *data,
		     unsigned int len, u8 *out);
	int (*digest)(struct shash_desc *desc, const u8 *data,
		      unsigned int len, u8 *out);
	int (*setkey)(struct crypto_shash *tfm, const u8 *key,
		      unsigned int keylen);
	unsigned int descsize;
	unsigned int digestsize;
	struct crypto_alg base;
};
> You mean pcomp should provide a struct crypto_type?
Yes, it should.  Although starting wish shash crypto_type no
longer needs to be directly visible to the algorithms as each
new type should now provide its own registration function which
can fill in the type object.
> And the underlying algorithms shouldn't use crypto_alg directly anymore?
Right.  Please take a look at include/crypto/hash.h, crypto/shash.c,
and crypto/sha1_generic.c from the cryptodev tree.  This should
provide everything you need to write a new type.
Thanks,
