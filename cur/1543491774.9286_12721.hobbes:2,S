Don't worry, I'm well aware of this: I've already started specing out
support for 64G physical memory on Intel.  _Right now_, the only special
case we support is ISA dma.  For the future, we will need something a
lot more powerful, but that is planned anyway.

I haven't seen much interest from people wanting >4G support on other
32-bit architectures, and on 64-bit platforms it's a different game
altogether.
