Hi, I am using linux kernel 2.4.2 and I have 1 GB ram.
I tried to boot the system with a ramdisk size of
600MB. It was ok when I did "mke2fs" on it, but when I
mounted it, it failed (Magic number mismatch). I tried
this several times and found that all ramdisk sizes
larger than 513MB could cause trouble. Could anyone
please kindly give me some hints? I would like to have
a larger ramdisk (around 800MB).
(note: I tried ramfs but it seems to have memory
leakage when files are deleted and created frequently;
tmpfs is ok, but the pages may be swapped, which is
not desirable in my case...)
Thank you very much!
Regards,
Roy
