The question is why the laptop powers off and back on. Do reboots from 
Windows do that? That is why the drive makes so much noise, because the 
kernel didn't standby the drive before rebooting, since it shouldn't 
have to, and yet the drive loses power so it does an emergency retract.
Making the kernel shutdown on reboot would only add more spindown/up 
cycles for normally working systems.
