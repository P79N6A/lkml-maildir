If there really was a grouping that was always guaranteed to match the
way you wanted to group tasks for e.g. resource control, then yes, it
would be great to use it. But I don't see an obvious candidate. The
pid namespace is not it, IMO. Resource control (and other kinds of
task grouping behaviour) shouldn't require virtualization.

Additionally, if we allow mature container subsystems to have an id
declared in a global enum, then we can make the cpu_ctlr.subsys_id
into a constant.

So what's the '-X' that you're referring to

Sounds reasonable.

I think the latter.

Right - having support for a hierarchy in the API doesn't mean that
individual controllers have to support being in a hierarchy.
