Yeah, no split.  The absence of a dirty flag denotes clean.

Well, if you don't mind the length you could do:
MD_SB_WRITEOUT_ALL	/* we need to flush all superblocks due
                         * to a device change. */
MD_SB_WRITEOUT_SOME	/* we need to flush the active devices
                         * superblocks due to normal write operations */
MD_SB_WRITEOUT_PENDING	/* the flush is underway */
In trying to come up with descriptive names for this, it really points
out how having both the "I need something" and "I'm handling something"
flags in the same name space sucks.
Anyway, I don't think Neil's original names were that bad, just
obviously the names describe the condition that precipitated the state,
not the current state, implying that a reader of that code should
probably be thinking about what caused the state more than the state
when determining the appropriate course of action.  It may be preferable
to leave them that way to push readers towards that sort of analysis,
whatever Neil thinks is best on that.
