Hello all,
I've just installed a multiport serial card released by an outfit called 
Syba.  This is an 8 port serial-only card with an Octopus style breakout 
cable.  The main chipset on it is an ITE IT8871F.
I've got two questions on this: Is there a driver I should try force 
loading on it (and if so, what options to use)?  and is there any useful 
testing I can do to report back to the LKML on this card?
Thanks for your time, diagnostic output follows.
