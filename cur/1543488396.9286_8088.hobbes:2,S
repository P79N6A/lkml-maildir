I'm getting something like this...  I can't lock files on NFS partitions :
fcntl(3, F_SETLK, {type=F_WRLCK, whence=SEEK_SET, start=0, len=0}) = -1 ENOLCK (No locks available)
Running through the debug output from the kernel I get :
Mar  4 00:18:23 thagdal kernel: nsm_mon_unmon: rpc failed, status=-93
Mar  4 00:18:23 thagdal kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 194.42.226.36
which I understand to mean that a program isn't registered.  But which
program ?
James.
