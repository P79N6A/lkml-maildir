Well you know my position on this. I think it's a bad idea because
it means we can never get rid of any old junk. IMNSHO arch/x86_64
is significantly cleaner and simpler in many ways than arch/i386 and I would
like to preserve that. Also in general arch/x86_64 is much easier to hack
than arch/i386 because it's easier to regression test and in general
has to care about much less junk. And I don't 
know of any way to ever fix that for i386 besides splitting the old
stuff off completely.
Besides radical file movements like this are bad anyways. They cause
a big break in patchkits and forward/backwards porting that doesn't 
really help anybody.

It's not really the same platform: one is PC hardware going back forever
with zillions of bugs, the other is modern PC platforms which much less
bugs and quirks
To see it otherwise it's more a junkification of arch/x86_64 than
a cleanup of arch/i386 -- in fact you didn't really clean up arch/i386 
at all.

You got not a single line less code duplication then, so i don't really
see the point of this.
