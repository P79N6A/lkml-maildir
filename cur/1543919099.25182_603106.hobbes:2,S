Yes. This is better. I will do it. Maybe it can be defined as a macro
for these architectures, as follow:
/* in linux/mm.h */
#ifdef CONFIG_HIGHMEM
void *copy_from_phys(void *to, unsigned long from_phys, size_t n);
#else
#define copy_from_phys(dst, phys, n)	memcpy(dst, __va(phys), n)
#endif

Yes. I will do it.
