Hi,
First release of squashfs.  Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only 
filesystem for Linux (kernel 2.4.x).  It uses zlib compression to 
compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes in the system are 
very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data overhead. Block 
sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 32K.
Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival 
use, and in embedded systems where low overhead is needed.
Squashfs is available from 
http://squashfs.sourceforge.net
.
The patch file is currently against 2.4.19.  There is further info on 
the filesystem design etc. in the README.
I'l be interested in getting any feedback, advice etc. on it.
