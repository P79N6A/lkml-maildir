The IO generator performed 4KiB sequential direct AIOs in a very small range (2MB - well within the controller cache on the external storage device). We have found that this is a simple way to maximize throughput, and thus be able to watch the system for effects without worrying about odd seek & other platter-induced issues. Each test took about 6 minutes to run (ran a specific amount of IO, so we could compare & contrast system measurements).

I also ran Caliper (akin to Oprofile, proprietary and ia64-specific, sorry), and looked at the cycles used. On an ia64 back-end-bubbles are deadly, and can be caused by cache misses &c. Looking at the gross data:

Freeing up cycles in the kernel is always helpful! :-)

Alan, thanks for your very nice testing efforts on this! It's very
encouraging to see that the kthread based approach is even faster than
the softirq one, since the code is indeed much simpler and doesn't
require any arch modifications. So I'd agree that just testing the
kthread approach is the best way forward, and that scrapping the remote
softirq trigger stuff is sanest.
My main worry with the current code is the ->lock in the per-cpu
completion structure. If we do a lot of migrations to other CPUs, then
that cacheline will be bounced around. But we'll be dirtying the list of
that CPU structure anyway, so playing games to make that part lockless
is probably pretty pointless. So if you get around to testing on bigger
SMP boxes, it'd be interesting to look for. So far it looks like it's a
net win with more idle time, the benefit of keeping the rq completion
queue local must be out weighing the cost of diddling with the per-cpu
data.
