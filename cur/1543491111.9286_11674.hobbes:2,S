same here, been using devfs since early february. works fine.
i use ingo molnar's raid patches aswell. i can almost apply the
.rej's in my sleep now. :) (-ac kernel is even more fun sometimes)
both these two patches have been rock solid for me (they complement
each other), and it would be great if they could move into the linus
kernel, perhaps marked as (Experimental) in the make config.
