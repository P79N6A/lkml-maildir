Hi,
last night I made a few new patches. For one there's a
quick scheduler patch which makes the scheduler consider
CPU usage on a somewhat longer term as well as on the
short term, giving CPU time away a bit more fairly when
a process sleeps for a few timeslices.
The second patch is a new version of the VM patch, packed
with suggestions from Davem (thanks Dave). The __alloc_pages()
function has been cleaned up and drop_behind() might actually
work now.
The balance between clean and dirty pages has also been changed
a bit and I can run a fairly smooth system even when there's
disk write IO going on...
The patches are available at the usual place:
