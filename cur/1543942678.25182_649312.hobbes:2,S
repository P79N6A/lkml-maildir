Negative values will be converted to MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET by msecs_to_jiffies 
and result in a very long interval. A too long interval will be a good way 
to get your system OOM. We could use an unsigned int or even restrict the 
value with proc_dointvec_minmax. I'd prefer the latter, that's what I 
already had in my mind and it also protects from unintentionally choosing 
a too long interval.
