I think this does what you want:
for size in "8" "16" "32" "64" ; do \
sed -r -i -e 's/\bu_{0,1}int'$size'_t\b/u'$size'/g' \
$(grep -rPlw --include=*.[ch] 'u_{0,1}int'$size'_t' drivers/net/e1000 drivers/net/ixgb); done
But why?  boolean_t is used by 3 subsystems with local typedefs.
These others are much more frequently used by kernel source.
$ grep -rPlw --include=*.[ch] "u{0,1}_{0,1}int(8|16|32|64)_t" * | wc -l
876
include/linux/types.h has typedefs for these but not boolean_t
include/linux/types.h:typedef           __u8            u_int8_t;
include/linux/types.h:typedef           __s8            int8_t;
include/linux/types.h:typedef           __u16           u_int16_t;
include/linux/types.h:typedef           __s16           int16_t;
include/linux/types.h:typedef           __u32           u_int32_t;
include/linux/types.h:typedef           __s32           int32_t;
include/linux/types.h:typedef           __u8            uint8_t;
include/linux/types.h:typedef           __u16           uint16_t;
include/linux/types.h:typedef           __u32           uint32_t;
include/linux/types.h:typedef           __u64           uint64_t;
include/linux/types.h:typedef           __u64           u_int64_t;
include/linux/types.h:typedef           __s64           int64_t;
