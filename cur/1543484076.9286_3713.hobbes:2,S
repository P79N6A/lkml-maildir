3Dnow are basicly some opcodes to do some floating point operations
commonly used in 3D graphics faster than with the normal K6 FP unit.
Anyone else?

The K6 and K6-2 floating point units aren't optimized to the point that
Intel's processors are. So when doing non-FP operations (like the bulk of
compile processes), the K6's fly.  The slow down somewhat when doing FP
operations, which MP3 does heavily.
On the bright side, the K7 FP units are supposed to fly! :)
