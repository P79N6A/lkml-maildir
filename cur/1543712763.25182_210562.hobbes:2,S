yes, see the two stack traces, they trigger in the same place and it's
the very same workload. Andrew just noticed that xfs indeed calls
truncate_inode_pages before vmtruncate. It will trigger with your
patches too.

Ok I see what you mean, this should fix it, agreed?

In practice doing a cow on a dma region is pretty useless, so I doubt
anybody would run into it but I agree the above is making the anon page
swappable and it's more correct.
