Hi,
In an attempt to play with ACPI S3 on my Athlon 64 X2 3800+, I recompiled 
2.6.16-rc2 with CPU hotplug and ACPI sleep state support. I experienced 
multiple crashes and oopsen, which I quickly discovered were the result of 
bringing at least one CPU back online.
echo 0 >> /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
Works, but then if I try to do:
echo 1 >> /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
I get an oops. Unfortunately this board has no serial ports so I've taken a 
digital camera shot of the oops. From dmesg, I'm using the PM timer.
[alistair] 02:13 [~] dmesg | egrep time\.c
time.c: Using 3.579545 MHz PM timer.
time.c: Detected 2500.768 MHz processor.
time.c: Using PM based timekeeping.

Find the oops, my config and dmesg for a successful boot at this location.

Cheers,
Alistair.
