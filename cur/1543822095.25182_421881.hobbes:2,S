Andries,
With the creative use of the MODE SELECT SCSI command
one can "short stroke" a disk, making subsequent READ
CAPACITY commands report less than is actually available.
READ and WRITE commands also would be crimped. For
example a 300 GB SCSI disk could be made to report
a capacity of 1 sector. [see sg_format in sg3_utils]
More practically RAID replacement disks may use this
facility if the firmware wants all disks the same
size and a smaller size disk (e.g. 18 GB SCSI disk) is
no longer available.
Without a product manual in which a manufacturer states
what the number of sectors should be, it may not be
obvious short stroking has occurred.
There are other situations I have come across, that can
be made to work if you know what is happening. When I
put a 160 GB PATA disk in an external USB enclosure that
doesn't support 48 bit lba, then I can't access anything
above the 137 (?) GB mark. By arranging my partitions
accordingly (e.g. 3 under, 1 over) the lower partitions
are still useable in the USB enclosure.
