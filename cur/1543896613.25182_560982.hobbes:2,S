You should run mcelog to decode what the machine checks mean.  These do point 
to a hardware problem.   Just briefly judging from you description of when 
the MCEs happen I wonder if the power supply is getting maxed out driving all 
of those disks.  Either way, use mcelog to find out what the MCEs are first.
