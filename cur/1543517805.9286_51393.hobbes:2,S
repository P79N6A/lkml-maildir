But ... have you looked at the _size_ of this change ??? It will basically
change ... let's see ... the _whole_ syncppp.c code (have a look at the
code and you'll understand), plus one structure (ppp_device) will probably
not be necessary anymore (which means changing the interface with drivers)
... Of course, I might be mistaken (actually, I _hope_ I am !! :).
Could you please analyze the situation and advise?? I could do the change
myself, but as it could possibly affect the interface with other drivers,
I'd like to hear your comments on the best approach to do the change.
Also, you said "that is one solution." Do you have any other possible
solution(s) in mind?? I'm open to other solutions as well. :)
Please let me know.
Regards,
Ivan
