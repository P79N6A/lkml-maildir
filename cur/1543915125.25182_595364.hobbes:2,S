Yeah.  It's the way all the other cpuid leaf/level stuff works, so it's
reasonable to do the same thing here.  The question it helps answer is
"I understand leaf 33, does the [v]CPU?".

Well, its also what the CPU itself does.  The feature bits tend to
relate to specific CPU features rather than CPUID instruction leaves. 
The features themselves may also have corresponding leaves, but that's
secondary.  IOW, if feature bit X is set, it may use leaf 0x4000101f,
but that doesn't mean leaves 0x40001001-1f are necessarily defined.

Well, it could be, but it would take affirmative action on the guest's
part.  If there's feature bits for each supported hypercall interface,
then you could have a magic MSR to select which interface you want to
use now.  That would allow a generic-interface-using guest to probe for
the generic interface at cpuid leaf 0x40001000, use 40001001 to
determine whether the hypercall interface is available, 4000100x to find
the base of the magic msrs, and write appropriate msr to set the desired
hypercall style (and all this can be done without using vmcall, so it
doesn't matter that hypercall interface is initially established).
