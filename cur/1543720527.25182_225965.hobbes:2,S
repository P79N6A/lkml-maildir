They will still work, as long as you don't recompile them with recent
toolchain.
When you recompile them, they either needs to be taught to DTRT (i.e.
use mmap with PROT_EXEC for executable stuff), or can be linked with
-Wl,-z,execstack to mark them as needing executable stack.
prelink package also contains execstack(8) utility which can be used
on already linked binaries/shared libraries.
