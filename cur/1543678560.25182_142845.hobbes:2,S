Interesting--I seem to be missing at least one change.  The last update 
on that file in my tree is 1.411, and yet when I do a "bk pull" it 
doesn't pick up anything new.  Have I found a bk bug?
One thing of note is that I ran "bk pull" late last night right after 
bkbits.net became available again.  Is it possible I picked up a partial 
update or something and now bk doesn't realize that it needs to get more 
stuff?
I'm re-cloning a second tree from scratch to make sure that it gets 
picked up in that tree.
Anything you want me to run in the affected tree to narrow down the issue?
Chris
