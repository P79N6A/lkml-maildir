ok, I get 4 of a kernel oops during boot, but the kernel seems to stay happy.  I'm going to keep it going for fun to see if I can cause more oopses.  Attached is the first of the 4 oopses.
according to dmesg, immediately prior to the first oops, smbfs was unloaded due to unsafe usage.
Exact Error:
Module smbfs cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in include/linux/module.h:482
I'll be around for a few more hours if there is anything I can do to help answer questions.
