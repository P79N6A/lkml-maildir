Because then, for a general solution that avoids integer
perversion, you need something like:
    char         buf[10];
    char         *end;
    if (count > (sizeof(buf) - 1))
        return -EINVAL;
    if (copy_from_user(buf, buffer, count))
        return -EFAULT;
    buf[count] = '\0';
    newval = simple_strtoul(buf, &end, 0);
    if (buf == end)
        /* Empty string or first char not a number */
        return -EINVAL;
    if (*end && ! isspace(*end))
        /* Bogus number. */
        return -EINVAL;
To me, It's a lot nicer to do:
    rv = user_strtoul(....);
    if (rv < 0)
        return rv;
Plus the scanning function I wrote handles arbitrary leading and 
trailing space, etc.  Not a big deal, but a little nicer.
