Alessandro Zummo broke the SB driver for normal SB16 and SBAWE32 cards
when he added support for a few other soundblaster compatable cards in
2.3.43. He currently knows about the problem and if you contact him (his
address is in sb_card.c) I'm sure he will be more than happy to let you
test his latest version.
Until then either use the driver from 2.3.42 and below or don't use
kernel isapnp.
