Greetings,
A simple question, I believe ...
I built my own 2.4.15-pre7 kernel today and have a problem - I can't start 
httpd.  Whenever I try I get the following messages:
Nov 20 18:53:35 walnut httpd: Ouch! ap_mm_create(1048576, 
"/var/apache-mm/mm.1529") failed
Nov 20 18:53:35 walnut httpd: Error: MM: mm:core: failed to acquire shared 
memory segment (Function not implemented): OS: No such file or directory
Which kernel CONFIG symbol I have set wrong?
Thanks.
David
P.S. I do have CONFIG_TMPFS=y and the df command shows:
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
