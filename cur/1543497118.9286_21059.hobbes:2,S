  does anyone know how to access termperature/fan/power sensor

  which sensor chip is used on this board?  where can I get docs for it ?
  using lm78.2.2.8.patch.gz from Erik Hendriks I get
  	LM78: Hardware monitor driver
  	LM78: Erik Hendriks <hendriks@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov>
  	LM78: $Id: lm78.c,v 1.4 1998/08/17 15:09:39 hendriks Exp $
  	LM78: Detection failed at 0x290
  and with procmbmon from Marwin Droid I get
  	# cat /proc/lm78 
  	Temperature 1   : 255
  	Core volt       : 4.07
  	+3.3 volt       : 4.07
  	+5 volt         : 6.85
  	+12 volt        : 15.50
  	-12 volt        : -14.15
  	-5 volt         : -6.11
  which doesn't look ok either.
try:
www.lm-sensors.nu.
the guys there have been working on an lm-sensors package for a long
while now. very full-featured, supports SMBus/i2c, so you can access
things like the EEPROM's on your DIMM's. Supports a wide range of
hardware sensor chips, including LM75/78/79, Winbond and others.
