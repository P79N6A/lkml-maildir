It definitely wants to be after mem= since mem= modifies the memory
layout before bootmem is initialised (and its required to be parsed
before bootmem is initialised, so bootmem knows where the memory is.)
So we require, in order:
- mem= to be parsed
- bootmem to be initialised
- drivers which want to allocate from bootmem to then be
  initialised
- setup rest of the kernel
- final command line parsing
which gives us three stages of command line parsing.
