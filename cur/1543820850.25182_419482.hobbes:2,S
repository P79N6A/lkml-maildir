No, it wouldn't.  The question itself is flawed - it presumes that AA
does confine the application to its expected behavior.  But with
incomplete mediation and ambiguous identifiers, there is no such
guarantee.  No profile will meet the "clearly cannot allow harm"
definition, because not all operations are controlled by it and of the
operations that are controlled, the actual objects are not clearly
identified, so harm is still possible.

If your goal is purely isolation, then virtualization may fit your
needs.  If you want to support controlled sharing of data while still
ensuring that certain confidentiality and integrity goals are met, then
you want a MAC mechanism.  But AA really isn't a MAC mechanism, despite
what its documentation may say.
