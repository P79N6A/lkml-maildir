ARP has been completely rewriten. You can configure the ARP timeout using
the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/<interface>/base_reachable_time interface.
The problem with tftp is that it is not handled by the kernel. For kernel
connection oriented protocols (TCP) the kernel signals forward process for
any successfull ack to the neighbouring cache, which will restart the 
neighbour entry expiry time. The user level tftp code has no way to do this, 
so the neighbour expires rather quickly.
