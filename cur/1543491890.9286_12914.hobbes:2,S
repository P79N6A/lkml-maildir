Sounds like the old PCI PnP motherboard problem to me...

For reference, some PnP motherboards ask a PnP video subsystem to
check what type of monitor is connected as part of their PCI
initialisation, and some video cards hang when asked to do so if no
monitor is connected.
The only cure I know of for that is to change the video card.

That's usually rather easier to fix - go into your ROM BIOS setup,
find the option determining what errors to stop on, and change it to
"None". The default is usually "All except keyboard", and the machine
will lock up if it can't find a video card on that setting.
