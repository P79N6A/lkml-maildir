The PTE pages get freed earlier.  On x86-64 also PMD/PGD. 
The code is needed to prevent a CPU from ever seeing any partially 
freed page tables. After the flush IPI happened the PTE pages
get freed, and if you dont reload to init_mm the CPU has
already freed page tables in its TLB.
Modern x86 do an awful lot of prefetching behind your back, doing
MMU lookup on adresses you never touched etc. and you have to 
be extremly careful to only ever have fully valid page tables
in CR3 all the time.
I had this code disabled on x86-64, but I have several open bugs 
because of this I thin (there were some other bugs in this logic too 
which I only recently fixed, but they were all 64bit specific). 
I can only advise against touching this! It is very easy to break
and very subtle.

It is correct.
