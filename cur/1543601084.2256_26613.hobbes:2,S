given
2.4.9-ac10 linux/kernel/fork.c:658
        p->start_time = jiffies;
is this
2.4.9-ac10 linux/fs/proc/array.c
                task->start_time,
correct? or should it be
		hz_to_std(task->start_time),
??
i know this will affect libproc, however libproc appears to be broken
anyway; i changed HZ and CLOCKS_PER_SEC to 1024 in include/asm/param.h
on x86 and top / ps etc are giving me very whacked out numbers.. the
machine itself is stable however and appears to be working just fine.
