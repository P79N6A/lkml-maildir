Ok, if you want to drag that baggage around for forever, fine.  But
don't force me to change anything in the pci core to enable that baggage
to stay :)

Can I ask if any of the development for other OSs has actually helped
Linux development?  I'm just curious.
And isn't the ACPI core development basically finished, so that now we
can start to do these OS dependent optimizations to allow the ACPI code
base to start to shrink and move towards looking more like the rest of
the kernel code, instead of looking like "something that got run through
a Linux kernelizer style generator"?

It would be, but as I just said in a different response, it's a _big_
change.  I can't just go breaking different arch's with impunity as I've
been doing in 2.5 :)
