Well unless someone removes the architecture specific assumptions of EFI,
and gets it going on every platform there certainly is.  Besides the
fact that despite a complete rewrite the current EFI BIOSes are the
slowest I have seen.  With linuxBIOS I can load a kernel image over
the network before my hard drives spin up to speed.  This isn't always
the right thing to do.  But waiting 45 seconds before you start
booting your operating system is equally insane.
Any bootloader interface that requires a callback for more then a
fatal abort of the loaded image will be misimplemented someday.  Even
on the alpha with it's small selection of Firmware this problem
persists.  So the interface to the firmware needs to be as trivially
simple as possible.
