Not when that replacement reduces readability, which in the case of
agpgart is all I care about wrt these changes.

Ok, for the ones I'm interested in, (agpgart), I don't see how things
can get much cleaner than they used to be.
07 - hammer. Needs to walk the whole list, matching pci devices on
     bus 0, func 3, slots >23 & <32
	 This set of rules is so specialised, I see it hard to concieve how
	 a generic helper function for the pci layer could be written.
08 - generic. Needs to know about every AGP device on the bus.
     ok, a for_each_agp_dev may actually make life easier here,
	 but as its the only place this happens, consider it inlined,
	 using pci_for_each_dev
09 - isoch. Could also use a 'for_each_agp_dev', but to be honest,
     it shouldn't be scanning at all, but being passed what it needs.
For the time being, I'm actually tempted to hack up a 'for_each_agp_dev'
for the latter two, but 07 still bugs me.
