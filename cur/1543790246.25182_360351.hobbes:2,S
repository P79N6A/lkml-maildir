No.  If we're emulating a cmpxchg() on a clean BSS page, this code
as it stands today will write to the zero page making it a page which
is mostly zero.  Bad news when it's mapped into other processes BSS
pages.
Changing this for pte_dirty() means that we'll refuse to do a cmpxchg()
on a clean BSS page.  The data may compare correctly, but because it
isn't already dirty, you'll fail.
If we still had it, I'd say you need to use verify_area() to tell the
kernel to pre-COW the pages.  However, that got removed a while back.
For the benefit of others, this is a bit of a bugger since you can't
use put_user() - the read + compare + write needs to be 100% atomic
and put_user() isn't - it may fault and hence we may switch contexts.
I don't have any ideas at present, but maybe that's because it's
getting on for 1:30am. 8/
