take a look at the PREEMPT_RT implementation of mutexes: it uses 
cmpxchg(), and thus both the down() and the up() fastpath is lockless!  
(And that is a mutex type that does alot more things, as it supports 
priority inheritance.)
architectures which dont have cmpxchg can use a spinlock just fine.
