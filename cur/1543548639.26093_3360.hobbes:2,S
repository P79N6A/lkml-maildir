Would it be possible to have an optional Id: tag where you could
suggest a unique identifier for your patch?  Humans are usually better
at picking sensible names than a machine, and in discussions, it is
better to refer to 'ide-foobar-fix3' than KP7562 even if the latter is
better for machines.  It also makes the Requires: header easier to
understand.
