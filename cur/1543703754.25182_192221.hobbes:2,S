You're right, it's quite safe, but still not very nice, since the lock
fortunately isn't held at the time we would call i8042_command. However,
since i8042_command doesn't disable interrupts globally (only locally),
an interrupt generated by the controller when it acks our command still
can happen on a second CPU. It'll spin on the lock, though.

Check my current version at bk://kernel.bkbits.net/vojtech/input, there
isn't I8042_BUFFER_SIZE cycle in the interrupt routine anymore.
