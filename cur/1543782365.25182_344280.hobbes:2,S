What the compiler may or may not generate is a little beside the point.
You have no guarantee that the CPU will execute these instructions in
the order given. If you need ordered writes use the appropriate barriers,
eg. wmb();
If this is PCI you also need to worry about the bridge caching. You
need to do dummy reads.
