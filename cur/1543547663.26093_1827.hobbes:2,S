Then it's actually not licensed to anyone, and is thus illegal to use
by anyone (unless you say otherwise, of course.)  You don't have to
put the © symbol into something for it to be copyrighted (although a
legal copyright notice, meaning "©", "Copyright", or "Copr", the year,
and the owner -- see the "Copyright" header of this message -- is
recommended.)
