Generally correct.  Of course, what is "hung" ?
If it is just sitting in uninterruptible sleep, it could legitimately be
waiting for an event.  More than likely, however, after some sane period
of time something is broken.
So, yah, it is a kernel bug.
I'll expand on your answer too - _why_ can't we kill it?  Same argument
we had over saving the futexes if a process bails.  You hold a semaphore
because you are entering a critical section.  If you die in the middle,
who knows the state the data is in and you do _not_ want to reenter it.
