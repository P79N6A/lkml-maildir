Applications that rely on linuxthreads, heh, that's a good one.
The most common use of LD_ASSUME_KERNEL is to force Linuxthreads to be
used in order to work around a bad bug in NPTL 0.60, often present on
Debian systems.  Ubuntu still reports NPTL 0.60, but they at least fixed
the bug for the Hoary release.  The Debian people refuse to.
The issue is very well known to JACK users.
