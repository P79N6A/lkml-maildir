 From an ease-of-use perspective I agree as this could be an option
but the point is to be able to manage the MD completely separate
in cases when you want for example to extend the MD volumes or
data volumes independently for example. It is all about different
address spaces and fencing. I am not sure is good for fsck tasks.

 From a code perspective should be possible. We could put it on a TODO
list if of interest for many. It is not a matter of naive users
or not. We are all naive when we use FS and are not experts in FS.

If we are all naive of course we want DualFS to be useful for
all. We are open for proposed features and criticism from
the community. It is just a mater of resources.
