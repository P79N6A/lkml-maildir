the 'is it running' check is 'task_curr(p)', which in this circumstance is
equivalent to the following test:
	per_cpu(runqueues, (cpu)).curr == p
where 'cpu' is p->thread_info->cpu. All pointers dereferenced in this test
are stable, because 1) send_signal() is always called within the siglock,
which serializes with task exit 2) p->thread_info->cpu is always valid for
the same reason.
so this seems to be safe to me.
