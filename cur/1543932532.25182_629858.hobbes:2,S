UML and a bunch of printk's to the rescue.
So we went back to double buffering, which then screwed up the d_off
of the dirents. I changed the temporary dirents to point to the current
offset so that filldir got what it expected when filling the user buffer.
Except it appears that it I didn't to initialise the current
offset for the first dirent read from the temporary buffer so filldir
occasionally got an uninitialised offset. Can someone pass me a
brown paper bag, please?
In my local testing, more often than not, that uninitialised offset
reads as zero which is where the looping comes from. Sometimes it
points off into wacko-land, which is probably how we eventually get
the looping terminating before you run out of memory.
That also explains why we haven't seen it - it requires the user buffer
to fill on the first entry of a backing buffer and so it is largely
dependent on the pattern of name lengths, page size and filesystem
block size aligning just right to trigger the problem.
Can you test this patch, Damien?
Cheers,
Dave.
