"Correct" for what? inode access control is correct if data secrecy is
your number one objective. It is not necessarily correct for other purposes.

What of it? That sounds very close to the AppArmor design, except for
the "discretionary" part. Just what is wrong with it? If your main
complaint is that you would miss having chmod and umask, then I agree:
we are not proposing to remove classic DAC. So what's your point?

Security design by Wilford Brimley: emphatic assertion :)
AppArmor is a fully functional access control system that works on
pathname-based access controls. I'm sorry if it violates your religion
for it to exist and work. Claiming that pathname-based access control is
"broken" or "wrong" is about as useful as standing at Kitty Hawk in 1903
exclaiming that heavier-than-air flight is impossible. You don't have to
like it, but denying its existence is nonsense.

It is totally appropriate because it goes to the core reason for the
design difference between AppArmor and SELinux. The NSA, and indeed all
intelligence agencies, have secrecy as their #1 security need. inode
labels is absolutely the right way to achieve that.
However, I assert (emphatically :) that the broader user community has
integrity and availability as higher priorities than secrecy, and that
pathname-based access control is a better way to achieve that. I want to
offer Linux users the choice of pathname-based access control if they
want it. Why do you want to prevent them from having that choice?
