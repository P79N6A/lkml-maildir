Hi,
in my s390 bag of patches I have another one... console_unblank can cause
an endless trap loop if the console semaphore is already taken and
console_unblank is called in interrupt context. To avoid the trap loop
just try to take to semaphore with down_trylock and exit if its fails.
Its not perfect since c->unblank() is not called in this case but way
better than an endlessly looping cpu. s390/s390x are the only two
architectures that still use console_unblank and for us this is acceptable.
The second change in this patch is to increase the log buffer to 128K. We
do print a LOT of message if cio_msg=yes is used.
blue skies,
  Martin.
