Another one i would recommend if this is making its way to the base linux
kernel is that we should ask the irq handlers to return some value so that
the kernel could know who took this interrupt. so if 2 devices are sharing
an 
interrupt, and if the kernel calls the first registered handler, and it knew
its
device interrupted, then on returning from the irq handler if we return 1 to
indicate this interrupt is consumer, we possibly dont need to send this to
all of the
registered handlers?
just a thought.
