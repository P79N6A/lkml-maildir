Subject: Why doesn't my system have the core_setuid_ok key?

Hello all:
I'm running the postfix mailing system and made a few modifications. 
It's dieing with signal 11 but not dumping core -- and I need a core 
dump.  I asked on the postfix group how to deal with this but they said 
I need to come talk to a linux group.  They said the reason is because 
my system will not let a process that starts life as root (but than 
drops privs) to dump core.  They said I need to check my 
kernel.core_setuid_ok key, but my systems don't have that key.  (I have 
redhat (2.4.20) and FC (2.6.12))
I've also already modified the /etc/security/limits and /etc/profile to 
allow system wide cores.
Can anyone shed some light on my attempts to get cores?
Thanks,
Jared DeMott
