No.  We been through this example (filesystem layouts) a few times.
It's of course not a kernel interface, and sharing it actually is harmfull,
because it means you can't change the structure layout for your filesystem
definition anymore, which unlike an actual ondisk change happens very
frequently, e.g. when introducing new unions keyed off a feature flag,
or similar things.  So please ship a copy with your userspace tools
package.
