FWIW-
I occasionally saw that error on our 2.4 RAID system; it went away when I
increased the size of the handles array in qlogicfc.h:
-#define QLOGICFC_REQ_QUEUE_LEN  127 /* must be power of two - 1 */
+#define QLOGICFC_REQ_QUEUE_LEN  255 /* must be power of two - 1 */
I know this probably isn't the ``right'' solution, but it worked for me...
your mileage may vary.
