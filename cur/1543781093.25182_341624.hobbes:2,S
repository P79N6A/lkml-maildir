I wrote some hacks over the years, not sure it would be useful
to post them because they all were very special purpose. 
I know users are doing the same because they complain on x86-64
when it doesn't work.

That's much more complicated. Instead of a simple read you would
need to parse complex ASCII output. Also gdb normally doesn't
work with a single System.map or /proc/kallsyms. I know it could
be gotten to use that stuff, but that would be all very complicated.
Much more complicated than read/write on /dev/kmem.
