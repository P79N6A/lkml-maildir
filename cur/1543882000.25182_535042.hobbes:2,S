Thanks for testing.

You have 3 tasks and only 2 cpus. The %cpu is the percentage of the cpu the 
task is currently on that it is using; it is not the percentage of 
the "overall cpu available on the machine". Since you have 3 tasks and 2 
cpus, the extra task will always be on one or the other cpu taking half of 
the cpu but never on both cpus.

There isn't much useful to say about the load average in isolation. It may be 
meaningful or not depending on whether it just shows the timing of when the 
cpu load is determined, or whether there is more time waiting in runqueues. 
Only throughput measurements can really tell them apart.
What is important is that if all three tasks are fully cpu bound and started 
at the same time at the same nice level, that they all receive close to the 
same total cpu time overall showing some fairness is working as well. This 
should be the case no matter how many cpus you have.
