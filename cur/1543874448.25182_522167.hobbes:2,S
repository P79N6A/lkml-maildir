The code never did that. In fact many of the problems we had initially
especially came out of that -- the fallback code that would handle
this case wasn't fully correct.

That was fixed too even before you dropped it by using probe_kernel_address()

That was because most of the bugs were reported many times duplicated --
and reports from older releases kept streaming in even after the fix
went in.
Also frankly often your analysis about what went wrong was just
incorrect.

There were some bugs, but they were all fixed. Or at least I hope -- 
we will find out during testing.

So do you have an alternative to the unwinder? Don't tell me 
"real men decode 30+ entry long stack traces with lots of callbacks
by hand". Or do you prefer to use frame pointers everywhere?
