This looks like some sort of pipe trouble to me.  It is repeatable using
such
a command:
$ gunzip < changelog.gz | less
^Z
$ fg
q   
iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/42088, count=2
$
I.e. stop "less" using ctrl+Z, use fg to bring it to the foreground,
then quit "less" using q.  
Piping from gunzip to less (or more) is necessary, and using
ctrl+Z and "fg" is necessary too.  
The inode number listed is different each time, so I guess it isn't
the i-number of the file.  The pipe maybe?
I use 2.3.16 UP, glibc 2.1 (debian potato), VESA fb, and this
happens both on console and in xterms.  Being root or user makes
no difference.
There *seems* to be no ill effects after this.  I don't really know
what to look for though, other than no crash after 4 days.
Please tell if there is more I could do, or some patch I could try.
