Nick,
That patch eliminates the regression on 2.6.13-rc5.  Thanks !!
We are currently evaluating it with other workloads.
It also gives a boost on 2.6.14, but unfortunately we are still 1%
regressed on 2.6.14.  (The regression on 2.6.14 was larger than
the regression on 2.6.13-rc5.)  We're trying to isolate the 2.6.14
regression now.  I'll let you know if we isolate it to a
scheduler change.
Cheers,
Brian
