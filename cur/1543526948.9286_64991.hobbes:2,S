Um, up? Not really sure what you are trying to say there, but it is up
acording to ifconfig (sometimes you are a bit too few worded :)
$ ifconfig shaper0
shaper0   Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:00:00:00:00
          inet addr:192.168.0.1  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP RUNNING  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:34 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          Collisions:0
