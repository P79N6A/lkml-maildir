I'm not sure if the usage has drifted to udev now, or is valid 
for both udev and also out-of-tree stuff which seems to be now 
discouraged.
I wonder what else should be set for proper udev operation, and 
should it be the default for those arch support it?  IOW is there 
a place for CONFIG_UDEV (or whatever) as user-visible choice to 
switch the feature on/off?
