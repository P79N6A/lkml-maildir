This makes me wonder if it makes sense to split up the LRU into page
cache LRU and mapped pages LRU. I see two benefits
1. Currently based on swappiness, we might walk an entire list
    searching for page cache pages or mapped pages. With these
    lists separated, it should get easier and faster to implement
    this scheme
2. There is another parallel thread on implementing page cache
    limits. If the lists split out, we need not scan the entire
    list to find page cache pages to evict them.
Of course I might be missing something (some piece of history)
