Hello!
> add 10.0.0.216 1.2.3.4 esp 34501 -E 3des-cbc "123456789012123456789012";
should read:
add 10.0.0.216 1.2.3.4 esp 34501
    -m tunnel
    -E 3des-cbc "123456789012123456789012";
KAME allows to use single SA both for transport and for tunnel,
we do not.
Actually, if you used setkey -D and setkey -DP to look at SAD/SPD,
you would notice this.
