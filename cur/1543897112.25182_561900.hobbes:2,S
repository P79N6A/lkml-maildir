Actually, ALSA is doing fine and doing great.  There are issues of course, 
and some bugs too, but they've got their mailing list and Takashi Iwai 
fixes things quite well (and fast). Calling something crap will be useless 
until you can prove it.  One minor complaint I have with ALSA is its 
documentation.  It provides basic stuff but one has to do a lot of 
cross-references, IMHO, to understand its API.  Other than that, with a 
mature open code base, ALSA is more excellent than OSS.
Before calling things crap, you should be more technical and realistic 
(i.e. prove it with example).  Otherwise, you will just be wasting your 
time whining.  It shows too your lack of technical skill since you complain 
without knowing what you're complaining about.
Best Regards,
Carlo
