You can also use 'findsuper' that comes with the e2fs utils pkg.  if it
doesn't find a superblock on 0 and 8193, etc, you likely have a screwed up
partition.  you'll need to carefully resize/move it until the superblock is
in the right place and a _READONLY_ e2fsck passes.  however, an e2fsck won't
be successful if the data has been corrupted but try your e2fsck until it
doesn't complain about the geometry of the partition and the 'findsuper'
grabs a superblock on 0.
