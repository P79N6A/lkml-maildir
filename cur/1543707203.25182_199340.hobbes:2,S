hwif->ide_dma_count() is gone in 2.6.3-rc4.
ATAPI drivers (ie. ide-cd.c) and TCQ code (ide-tcq.c)
use ->ide_dma_begin() and ->ide_dma_end() directly.
DMA timeout recovery functions also call ->ide_dma_end().

To setup a DMA transfer:
ATA: ->ide_dma_{read,write}() (they call ->ide_dma_begin()) or
     __ide_dma_queued_{read,write}() (they may call ->ide_dma_begin())
ATAPI: ->ide_dma_{read,write}() + ->ide_dma_begin()
Hope this helps.
