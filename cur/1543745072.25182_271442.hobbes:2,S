Subject: mlock hanging on non-ram with VM_IO set

I've got a report of mlock deadlocking on non-ram mappings (precisely on
a mmap of /dev/mem outside the mem_map array range)
I believe this should fix it (I verified the mlock is the only one
passing down pages == NULL, and infact mlock is the only one hanging on
VM_IO vmas since the pfn isn't valid and handle_mm_fault sure can't
istantiate a valid pfn there since the ptes are filled synchronously at
mmap time), comments? (I don't see any reason why mlock should be
allowed to trigger page faults on VM_IO regions)
This is not a bad bug, mlock is privilegied, and /dev/mem is privilegied
too, and mlock makes no sense on a non-ram mappings (noop), but I guess
it's ok to add it mostly for things like mlockall that would otherwise
deadlock the box and I guess it's nicer if they work transparently, no
matter what mappings are in the task.
btw, mlock traps the error and ignores it as it should.
this is untested but I guess it should fix it (and it applied cleanly to
kernel CVS).
