Mark,
I've ported the old sataMV driver (version 3.6) to the 2.6.23.1 
kernel - and it works - no problems with a full mem=4000M (4Gig). 
The only problem with this is that it is MUCH slower than the 
sata_mv driver which - by this test - definitely has some 
bug/dependency that gets broken when the physical memory 
overlaps its memory I/O locations (and should be iomapped &
dma mapped to a separate space up in 0xC_xxxx_xxxx)...
Time to dig in and debug this driver! UGH!
Tom
