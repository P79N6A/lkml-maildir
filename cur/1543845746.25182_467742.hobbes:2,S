That's what I'm saying (ok, I didn't mention the "GPLv3 or later"
wording). Once v3 is out, you can choose between v2 and v3.
v2 seems to only forces you to keep the notice that v2 is valid.
The current v3 draft forces you to keep all license notices.
So if at all, you can only remove anything _but_ v2, but never v2.
But I've just re-read section 9 and "this License" obviously just refers to
just the GPL there, as the version number of "this License" is mentioned.
So removing the "or later" won't work either and you simply cannot change
which versions apply at all (at least not without all copyright holders
agreeing on that change).
