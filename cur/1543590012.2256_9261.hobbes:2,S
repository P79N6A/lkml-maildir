I've seen some others reporting some success with K6-II[I] or
Pentium-II[I] configurations. I haven't tried it here as 2.2.19 is
running fine for me. -) I just keep trying the new 2.4.x and reporting
here with hopes someone will find the problem and be able to resolve it.
There could very well be something wrong with my/our hardware. I'm at a
loss as to why none of the developers can reproduce this? Is it possible
none of the 'core' developers have/have access to this hardware? It
isn't all that unusual I think.
If anyone needs more info, just ask. Lots of time/hardrive space here
available for experimenting. (As long as you don't blow it up -) ).
