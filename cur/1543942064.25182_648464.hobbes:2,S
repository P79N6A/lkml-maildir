Are you sure that that is not only (the results of) propaganda of
(certain) proprietary companies?
Usually the *user* (at home, wherever) sets "illegal" values. So it's
the users responsibility and the manufacturer, importer or sellers don't
care (if only that can't prevent other "illegal" actions like "beating
some to death with $WLAN_ROUTER").
Or do you get a gun manufacturer before court just because someone
committed a crime with a its gun?
Feel free to use other comparisons like "knifes" or "cars" if you need
more harmless examples ....
