Presumably that part of the process can be automated:
$ cd /usr/src/linux
$ ./scripts/submit-patch /tmp/patch-1 /tmp/patch-2 /tmp/patch3...
The first time you'd run this hypothetical script, it would ask for
template field values and offer to remember the ones that don't change
often, such as the architecture you're working on.  Presumably it would
work in batch mode, too, if you had several related patches.
