Ok, I guess.  But isn't there some module reference that can trigger the
install of psmouse?

Something like "...passing the name of the device in the form
'char-major-x-y' for misc devices and 'char-major-X' for others"
BTW, could kmod just pass the name of the file from the open() call?
Modprobe could look up the major-minor and/or users could create virtual
devices.  For example, I create a file /dev/my_psaux which is a symlink to
/dev/psaux, the name gets passed to modprobe.  modprobe looks it up and
finds that it's not a device file and looks for an alias, and finds psmouse,
loads it,...problem solved.
thanks for the info,
jeff
