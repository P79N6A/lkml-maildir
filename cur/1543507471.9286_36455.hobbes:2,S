No. If current->need_resched is set, we should reschedule at a preemption
point. What your patch does is dramatically increase the number of
preemption points -- that changes the meaning.

It absolutely is something new. In the current kernel, we check for
preemption only at points where we are about to do a context
switch anyways - from k to user modulo some places like mem.c .
That is the logic is:
                     before commit to a switch to user, see
                     if there is a hint to call the scheudler
This is not the same as
                     before copy a block check to see if there
                     is a hint to call the scheduler.

The patch is not intended to add additional behavior.  I know that. I
still don't see why the screen saver i/o ops that will either set needs
rescehd directly or schedule a bottom half task will not cause extra
context switches.

How do you know?

In the current system, yes. After your patch, it is not at all clear.
