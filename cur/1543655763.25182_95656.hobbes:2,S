I don't think we can blame X in this particular situation.  When I
press ctrl-alt-F1 in X, it resets the screen to the colormap and depth
that the text console was using, but the kernel doesn't redraw the
text console screen image.  (I presume it also resets the resolution,
but since I have only tried on an LCD screen I can't say for sure.)
