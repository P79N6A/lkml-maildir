I'm using a Logitech Cordless TrackMan here, and this works fine with 
2.4.21-rc1. I don't know which trackball you have, but the Logitech input 
devices all seem to be using more or less the same receiver, and this is what 
the problem would be about.
Anyway, if not done already, I would suggest that you plug the trackball right 
into one of the computer's USB ports and not into an external hub to see if 
that makes a difference.
Greetings
