Sure, will fix this.

Ok, I see. The question is, are we going to hwrng_register() the
intel, althought there is no device? We check for the PCI IDs.
Anyway. This should be fixed.
And I think this is also a good time to split the x86 driver,
so all this init-stuff is much cleaner.

Ah, and I found another bug in hwrng_unregister:
	current_rng = list_entry(rng_list.prev, struct hwrng, list);
current_rng->init() should be called here (if nonNULL). If that fails
current_rng = NULL;
Will fix that, too.
