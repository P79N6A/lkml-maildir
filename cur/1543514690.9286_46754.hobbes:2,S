  Hi, all. Version 132 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
NOTE: this patch removes more compatibility entries. If you need the
compatibility entries, install devfsd-v1.2.8 which will create them
automatically if you ask.
This is against 2.3.22-pre1. Highlights of this release:
- Removed compatibility entries for floppy devices
- Removed compatibility entries for RAMDISCs
- Removed compatibility entries for meta-devices
- Removed compatibility entries for SCSI discs
- Created <devfs_make_root>
- Removed /dev/sd hierarchy
- Support "../" when searching devfs namespace
- Removed compatibility entries for IDE discs
- Removed /dev/ide/hd hierarchy
- Removed compatibility entries for IDE CD-ROMs
- Removed /dev/ide/cd hierarchy
				Regards,
					Richard....
