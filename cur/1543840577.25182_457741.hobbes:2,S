BusyBox has been doing this for months now: "build at once" is one of our 
config options.  I'd like to point out that gcc eats needs several hundred 
megabytes of ram to do this and you have no useful progress indicator between 
starting and ending.  But the result is definitely smaller.
We also tell the linker "--sort-common --gc-sections" which may or may not 
apply here...
