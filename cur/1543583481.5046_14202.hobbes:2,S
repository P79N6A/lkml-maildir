It all depends on exactly what you are doing.
I suspect that for most "normal" situations, 2.4 should be
pretty stable.
There are, however, a few areas where we still have bugs:
- loop device driver (fixed in -ac?)
- highmem (fixed in -ac?)
- SMP (detection, fixed ??)
- IPX
- NFS (fixed in -ac?)
I suspect we'll be finding a few more over the next weeks,
but if you're just using your machine as a webserver and
are not using anything special (ie. just ext2, tcp/ip, etc.)
2.4 should be solid.
regards,
Rik
