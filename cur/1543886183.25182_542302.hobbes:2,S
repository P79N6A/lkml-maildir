Probably something different - at least once, I've caught it on /0 with
2 real cores online (T7200).  Looking at kernel/softirq.c, the ksoftirqd()
function is basically 2 nested while() loops.  Looks like  either local_softirq_pending()
gets stuck true, but no obvious reason why, or something odd is getting
set in the current-> structure so when we call schedule(), we end up returning
rather than hitting the idle loop.
Off to go see how much mm-bisect I can do before dinnertime - the rest will be
later tonight...
