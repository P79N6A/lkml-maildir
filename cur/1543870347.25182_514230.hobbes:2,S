no - i did not 'ask' it to be removed from epoll, i only pointed out 
that with edge-triggered the results were highly unreliable here and 
that with level-triggered it worked better. Just to make sure: if you 
put back edge-triggered into evserver_epoll.c, do you get the same 
numbers, and is CPU utilization still the same 98-100%?
