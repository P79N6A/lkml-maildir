The file is 43,814,956 bytes in length.

Both 36 and 44 bytes hurt.

RockRidge attributes created by:
if  ! test $1 ; then
    echo "Usage cp.iso <directory>"
    exit 1
fi
umount /mnt 2>/dev/null
DEV=`cdrecord -scanbus | grep ROM | cut -f2,2`
echo Using CD-ROM device, ${DEV}
echo Trying to erase the media
cdrecord dev=${DEV} blank=fast
echo Starting to write the media 
nice --18 mkisofs -L -l -R $1 | cdrecord -v fs=6m dev=${DEV} speed=4 -eject -

Just what 'mount' finds:
mount /dev/cdrom /mnt
It gets "fixed" by doing:
mount -o loop /dev/cdrom /mnt
/dev/cdrom is a sym-link to /dev/scd0

This showed up when trying to use a "wave-file-copy-truncation" routine
with the source file on a CDROM.
The source-code for these "wave-file" tools is:
	
ftp://boneserver.analogic.com/pub/downloads/wave_tools.tar.gz
Broken windows users have to access as:
	ftp:/boneserver.analogic.com/pub/downloads/wave_tools.tar.gz
  or else windows adds ..//ftp/.., a known bug.

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
