The failure mode I'm seeing is that the timer interrupt disappears.  
Hard to schedule processes at that point.  I'm not seeing the IRQ issues 
personally.
HP's LP1000r machine uses ServerWorks, but still shows the problem.  I 
only have access to HP SMP hardware currently, but they all have the 
same issue.  I've heard of Tyan and Asus issues (not just the one 
recently posted), though I have an LX machine that has been okay with 
2.4.
I've seen the VIA issues, but they aren't related from what I can tell.
