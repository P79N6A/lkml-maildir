Can you explain this to Steve?  I'm still quite clueless about network
filesystems, but it sounded as if such an optimization was impossible
to do in cifs without a combined create/copy/unlink_on_error system
call.
If your suggestion works and the network filesystems can be changed to
work independently of a struct file*, I agree with you that copyfile()
is a stupid idea and should be forgotten.
