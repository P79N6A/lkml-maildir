That's pretty lame.  It means that pipes just won't work, so people who are
using pipes in their initramfs setups will just get mysterious failures
running userspace on a crippled kernel.
I think the bug really is the running of populate_rootfs() before running
the initcalls, in init/main.c:init().  It's just more sensible to start
running userspace after the initcalls have been run.  Statically-linked
drivers which want to load firmware files will lose.  To fix that we'd need
a new callback.  It could be with a new linker section or perhaps simply a
notifier chain.
