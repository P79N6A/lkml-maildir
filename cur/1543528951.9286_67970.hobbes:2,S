Hi,
My idea (and I think someone else said that as well) would be 
to either provide enough stubs in the PCI code to not have to worry about
CONFIG_PCI, or to keep the existing (2.2) situation, with additional
dependencies for drivers that are PCI only, like
dep_tristate '    PCI NE2000 support' CONFIG_NE2K_PCI $CONFIG_PCI
For 2.5, the entire config-system must go, as it is way to limited for the
current kernels.
Greetings,
