Unfortunately, it would destroy the REQ_BARRIER approach in the block layer.  
At best, abort probably causes a command to overtake a barrier it shouldn't, 
at worst we abort the ordered tag that is the barrier and transactional 
integrity is lost.
When error correction is needed, we have to return all the commands for that 
device to the block layer so that ordering and barrier issues can be taken 
care of in the reissue.  This makes LUN RESET (for those that support it) the 
minimum level of error correction we can apply.
