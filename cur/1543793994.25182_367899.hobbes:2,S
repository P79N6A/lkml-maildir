I've used Julian's patch; it worked fine.  But while trying to debug some
issues with a 4xE1/T1 card, I had to do external loopback with an
unpatched 2.4 kernel.  IIRC, the following did the trick:
for p in 0 1
do
   /sbin/ip link set dev hdlc$p up multicast on
   /sbin/ip addr add dev hdlc$p local 192.168.$p.1 peer 192.168.$p.2
   echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/hdlc$p/rp_filter
done
# Trick the kernel into sending the packets over the wire
/sbin/iptables -t mangle -F
/sbin/iptables -t nat -F
/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 192.168.0.2 -j SNAT --to 192.168.1.2
/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 192.168.1.2 -j SNAT --to 192.168.0.2
/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -t nat -d 192.168.1.2 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.1
/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -t nat -d 192.168.0.2 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.1
To test, send traffic to either 192.168.0.2, or 192.168.1.2, e.g.,
    ping -T tsandaddr 192.168.0.2
