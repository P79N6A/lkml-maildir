Subject: [small BUG] Makefile bug with gcc 3.1 and non english locales

Hello,
well, if i use gcc 3.1 with the current Makefile, the gcc specific include
dir is not well parsed in this expression :
kbuild_2_4_nostdinc	:= -nostdinc $(shell $(CC) -print-search-dirs | sed -ne 's/install: \(.*\)/-I \1include/gp')
because my system is fr_FR and the gcc output begins with :
Installé: ...
So i have to put LC_ALL=C before compiling the kernel.
I think you should set LC_ALL=C in the Makefile in order to avoid that
problem with locales.
Regards
PS : Please CC me the answers.
