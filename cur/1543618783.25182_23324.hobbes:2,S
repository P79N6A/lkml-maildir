I understand (not well enough, perhaps) that there are some known
problems with a combination of Via chipset and SBLive!.  Indeed, I have
experienced these myself, in that sometimes, when a sound is about to
play (as when I roll up my GNOME panel), the speakers first emit a burst
of noise (sounds like a can of pop opening) before playing the sound.
On viaarena.com I read about worse problems when running Windows, but
the fact remains that the problems exist.  I was able to reduce the
problem somewhat by following someone's (from Via Arena) recommendation,
namely to move the DBLive! card to PCI slot 3.  The reason behind the
move, accordig to the group is to obtain a unique IRQ for the card. 
Well, my current IRQ setup (according to lspci -v) is as follows:

Unfortunately, the problem still surfaces occasionally.  Can you please
advise me on what I can do to (hopefully) eliminate this problem ?
Thanks.
