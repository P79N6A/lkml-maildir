Hi Alan, 
The following patch fixes the problem that when you change the UART
type, the kernel will install the FIFO depth of the OLD UART.
Now, this bug will rarely cause dataloss, as people will normally just
set their UART from the default (unknown UART, 1-byte FIFO)to the one
they actually have. However someone trying a few things will end up
with a not-working setup if he goes to the right setting from a chip
that happens to have a larger FIFO. 
In short, the exising code is obviously wrong and should be fixed ASAP. 
Alan, I think you missed this when I first posted it. I didn't check
that you picked it up until just now. Sorry.
				Roger.
