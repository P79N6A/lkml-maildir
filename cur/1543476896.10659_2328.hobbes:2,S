	Last evening I've decided to compile a new 2.2.0-pre6 on a Dual
P][-350, WD SCSI 64Megs etc. It took me about 7 minutes, with the
_existing_SMP_ 2.2.0-pre6. I have a K62/350 at home and it compiles
the same kernel with _almost_ the same options in _almost_ the same time :(
Do I have to get a different egcs/gcc in order to use both processors
when compiling something or are there exxxtra options in order to enable
some SMP extra stuff? I have to mention that a cat /proc/cpuinfo shows
both processors so it has to be okay...
	Sorry if I am lame :)
