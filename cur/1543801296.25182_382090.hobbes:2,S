Moore's law actually doesn't say anything about performance increases,
just about the number of transistors available.

It's not true. e.g. a 2.6 Ghz FX-57 is significantly faster than the
top end CPU you could get 2 years ago. And I'm sure this years CPUs
will be still faster than last years.

Even smaller systems are still getting faster.
