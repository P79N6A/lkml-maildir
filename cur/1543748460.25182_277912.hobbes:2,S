Sloppy rss left the rss in the section of mm that contained the counters.
So that has a separate cacheline. The idea of putting the atomic ops in a
group was to only have one exclusive cacheline for mmap_sem and the rss.
Which could lead to more bouncing of a single cache line rather than
bouncing multiple cache lines less. But it seems to me that the problem
essentially remains the same if the rss counter is not split.
