I don't know how it is spurious... Presumably the sequence _would_ have
caused preempt count to go negative if the bkl were not held...
__do_softirq does a __local_bh_disable on entry, and it seems like the
_local_bh_enable on exit is what causes this warning. So something is
unbalanced somehow. Or is it some weird thing we do in early boot that
I am missing?
Can you put in some printks around these functions in early boot to
get an idea of what preempt_count is doing?
