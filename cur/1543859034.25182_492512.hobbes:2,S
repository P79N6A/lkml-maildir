Well they do work differently.  3Dfx just did alternate line rendering,
while nvidia does a lot more methods of dividing the work load (many of
which are likely to be more efficient than alternate line rendering in
general).  No doubt why they picked the name SLI though.  They did also
buy out 3Dfx so I guess by that they can claim to have "invented" it. :)
