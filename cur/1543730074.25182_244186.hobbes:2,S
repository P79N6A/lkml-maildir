The main reason I suggested correcting the checksum is if it was done that way, the kernel would 
behave normally for all other IP traffic and simply do a dodgy on only traffic from 192.168.1.1
If nobody else jumps in, let me think about it for a day or so and I'll see what I can do. It's been 
a couple of years since I last looked at the network code though.
What kernel are you running?

Brad
