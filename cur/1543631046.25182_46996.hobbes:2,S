There is a test just not clearly stated, "data block transferred".
It is hidden in the state diagram in the transition states.
Since there is no accounting process in the driver, as it has been
exported to block because of partial completions and page walking.
But obviously most people question my proven judgement on how things work,
so I expect this to be ignored by the masses on lkml.  However you I
expect to see the point and issues.
