To be sure, we as programmers will have the most freedom if there is
no form of intellectual property protection for software at all
(imagine all of those Renaissance publishers whose sensibilities would
have been quite shocked by the suggestion that their distribution of
some author's work for a small fee was somehow "theft").
It's less clear to me that a more expansive "we" will be equally well
served, freedom-wise, by less protection though I'm very sympathetic
to the argument.
