Hi again,
the previous patch was for the 2.6.22 kernel. The two below are for the 2.6.24.3 and 2.6.25-rc3, respectively:

> tuner initialization failure is located in the attach_inform function in
> the bttv-i2c.c file. There at the very beginning the addr variable holding
> the tuner device address is initialized with the value taken from the
> bttv_tvcards array. For the PixelView PlayTV card the tuner address field
> (and the radio address as well) was uninitialized, and thus equal 0. Later
> in that function execution of the TUNER_SET_TYPE_ADDR tuner command is
> guarded with check for the tuner address either equal ADDR_UNSET, or
> client->addr. Since both are non-zero (the latter in case of   the card
> owned by me at the runtime is equal 0x61) the TUNER_SET_TYPE_ADDR command
> is not executed, and consequently in the tuner_attach function in the
> tuner-core.c file call to i2c_attach_client does not result in assigning
> the tuner type variable with the requested value. Providing initialization
> of the tuner_addr and radio_addr with ADDR_UNSET values as it is already
> done for other tv cards defined in bttv-cards.c ensures that the tuner
> initialization is done correctly, just as it used to be in the 2.6.14
