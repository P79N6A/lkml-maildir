I think you did not get the meaning that I was trying to convey...
I didn't mean "If it fixes a regression, it should be accepted."
I meant "If it does not fix a regression, it should not be accepted."
I have the impression that the 2.6.x.y series were suggested because
of regressions in 2.6.11 over 2.6.10 and we needed a way to respond to
that.   I think it should purely be a response to that.
The issue that made me think through this is the locking bug in nfs
(there is a significant delay in getting a contended lock after the
holder drops it).  It has been suggested at least twice for 2.6.11.y.
While it would be nice to have it fixed, I really don't think it
should be a candidate for 2.6.11.y.  It should go into 2.6.12
(which it will) and that should be released 6-10 weeks post 2.6.11
which, given the bug as been around for a lot longer than that without
being widely noticed, should be soon enough.
I fear that if too many bug fixes go into 2.6.11.y, it might seem to
take the pressure of 2.6.12 coming out in a timely fashion, and I
wouldn't like to see that.
