I'd pulled this before, here's the output.

Definitely. I should have noted that the 2.4.22 tests on that dd came
back in 23.607s, the 2.6.0 tests hadn't returned for over 4 minutes.

This is a 53C1030 with a RAID1 mirror. Now that I think about it, I did
the >2GB bonnie tests on a single disk, no mirror. I'll rerun the i/o
tests with this setup and then remove the mirror and see what happens.
