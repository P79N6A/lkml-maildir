What is giving me an alarm signal is:
Since it is a raid1 I expected user space not being affected.
(The other drive did not show any error messages since installation,
they are Maxtors 6Y120L0 (120 GB) cooled quite well) So I thought that
ClearCase should not have seen any error return code.
In the meantime I have just re-synced the faulty drive and there were
no write error messages and the bad block seems to be properly re-mapped

there is still interest what "sector=1766272" actually means, e.g given
a partition table and LBAsect, how to calculate 'sector' or vice versa.
Thanks,
