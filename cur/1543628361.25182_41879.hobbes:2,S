Very nice.  A few nits noted below.

Classic 'Linus' multi-line comment style looks like this:
/*

 * and so on
 */
Just goes to show, there's not way to make /* bracket comments */ look nice ;-)

IOW, it's an offset.  This is a (minor) flaw in the api.  Address should be passed
as (void *) and we should have:
	ulong offset = address &= ~PMD_MASK;
Granted, such cleanupd are not the goal of your patch.

Whitespace glitch here.

Actually, the spinlock is dropped because alloc_page can sleep, which is a
bug if you are holding a spinlock.

It's not subtle, it's just awkwardly written.  We should have ulong offset and
void *address.  The masking is a meme in Linux mm and does not require a 
comment.

If so, it's a 'fixme'.

This comment is too much like:	x = 1 /* assign 1 to x */

But this part is somewhat interesting.

It certainly is.

Redundant comment.  You can look at the comment on alloc_are_pmd to know that,
and the name says it as well.
Well, I'm only about 20% of the way through the patch and have other work to
attend to.  I suggest that you now try to *remove* as much redundant verbiage
as you can.  You should really assume a somewhat higher level of familiarity
with Linux basics.  Just as a guess, you should end up with less than half
the text you've proposed adding.
That said, I found some of your comments to be informative even though I'm
familiar with this particular piece of code.  For someone not familiar with
it but familiar with Linux in general, your additional comments will save
time in reading the code.
IMHO, with some more work this will be a useful contribution.
