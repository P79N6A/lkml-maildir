Subject: Broken Promise Ultra66 IDE driver in 2.3.31?

I've applied the 2.2.10.uniform-ide-6.20.draco.patch to a 2.2.13ac3 kernel
(manually) and it works great. 2.3.31 is supposed to include the uniform
IDE with the Promise Ultra66 driver (and it does), but it I enable DMA, it
gets half way through listing the partitions on IDE drives, hangs for
around 10 seconds, and then gets a DMA timeout, and locks solid. No panic,
nothing. Not even the ACPI power off switch works.
The 6.20 uniform IDE driver works fine at UDMA(66), but I can't get the
driver to work in 2.3.31. Is it broken, or am I doing something stupid?
