Hi!
After a keyboard and mouse idle time the display becomes black,
that would be normal. But what isn't normal that it stays
this way. No keypress wakes it up. The machine still works,
e.g. numlock responds, I hear the disk moving its head (it was
compiling egcs), etc. It happens on 2.4.0-test5pre5, maybe
older ones, too.
