Ok, added. You can update your tutorial to make the initial setup of a 
kernel archive slightly less scary, ie it's now
	git clone rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git linux-2.6
	cd linux-2.6
	git checkout
which looks almost user-friendly.
(Of course, since the rsync protocol doesn't know anything about git
consistency, if the mirroring is half-way, you'll end up with something
less than wonderful, and confusing. Details, details)
