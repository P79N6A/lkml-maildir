Sorry if this is an old issue, but I'm still seeing this problem between
ALI15x3 and Maxtor drives when DMA is enabled...
If I run 2.4.19 DMA is not autodetected. I get lousy performance. I can enable DMA (with hdparm) on all but my Maxtor drive, but if I manually enable DMA on the Maxtor drive disk access freezes (to both drives on the channel).
If I run 2.4.19-ac4 DMA is turned on automatically and the system hangs at the partition check.
on 2.4.19 I see this in dmesg:
...
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
ALI15X3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 20

Partition check:
 /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0: p1 p2 < p5 p6 p7 >
 /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target1/lun0: p1
 /dev/ide/host0/bus1/target1/lun0: [PTBL] [2495/255/63] p1
2.4.19-ac4 (correctly) probes hda and hdb as being UDMA(100), but it looks like hdb chokes on the DMA...
