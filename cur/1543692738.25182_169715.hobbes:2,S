I am having trouble with the suspend/resume area in -test3.
I suspend with 'echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep' after unloading as many of the
modules as possible (though usbcore won't unload) and it appears to
suspend correctly.
On resume I get 'Incorrect kernel version', and failure to resume from the
saved image.
Machine is a dell inspiron 4100 laptop running gentoo linux.
128mb ram
swaps:
minipio root # swapon -s
Filename                                Type         Size    Used    Priority
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part2   partition   530136  76400   -1
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1   partition   441748  0       -2
What information do you want to assist with the resolution of this
problem?
(under -test6 I get no effect from either /proc/acpi/sleep or
/sys/power/state - i.e. I do the echo and absolutely nothing happens, and
nothing in the kernel logs)
Thanks,
Cathal.
