Have to agree with Jared here, cramfs is a perfectly sensible thing to
use on many platforms. 
Adding the ability to make particular files XIP on those platforms is
also quite reasonable. 
The alternative would be to add a whole new filesystem to the kernel
(effectively obsoleting cramfs) just to add XIP support or to compile
in a second filesystem (ext2 w/XIP) just for a few files.
Keeping cramfs as a simple example filesystem is really not all that
worthwhile, given it's not much of an example.
