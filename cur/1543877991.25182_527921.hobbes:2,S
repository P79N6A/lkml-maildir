Similar comments apply.  congestion_wait() should be called
throttle_at_a_rate_proportional_to_the_speed_of_presently_uncongested_queues().
If a process is throttled in the page allocator waiting for pages to become
reclaimable, that process absolutely does not care whether those pages were
previously dirty against /dev/sda or against /dev/sdb.  It wants to be woken
up for writeout completion against any queue.
-		wbc.encountered_congestion = 0;
+		wbc.encountered_congestion = NULL;
 		wbc.nr_to_write = MAX_WRITEBACK_PAGES;
 		wbc.pages_skipped = 0;
 		writeback_inodes(&wbc);
 		min_pages -= MAX_WRITEBACK_PAGES - wbc.nr_to_write;
 		if (wbc.nr_to_write > 0 || wbc.pages_skipped > 0) {
	 			/* Wrote less than expected */
-			congestion_wait(WRITE, HZ/10);
-			if (!wbc.encountered_congestion)
+			if (wbc.encountered_congestion)
+				congestion_wait(wbc.encountered_congestion,
+						WRITE, HZ/10);
+			else
Well that confused me.  You'd be needing to rename
wbc.encountered_congestion to congested_bdi or something.
