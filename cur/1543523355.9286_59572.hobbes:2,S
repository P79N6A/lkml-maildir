Hello,
  I know that this has been brought up in the past ... but can someone
refresh my memory as to why network devices will respond to arp requests,
even with 'NOARP' set? (kernel 2.[23].x, via 'ifconfig <Dev> -arp', or 'ip
link set up <dev> arp off')
  I would assume, that if you tell a device not to arp .. it shouldn't .. I
have a patch for 2.2.13, which does the trick, but we'd like to upgrade the
kernel on our cluster to 2.3 for the increased memory and file size support,
but can't because the machines respond to arp requests on the devices we
don't want them to respond on ..
Thanks,
  Terry
