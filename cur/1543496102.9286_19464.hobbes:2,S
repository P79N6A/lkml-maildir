Hi Alan & All,
Since version 2.2.x I'm being having those errors on my dual PPro
machine.
Is there anything I can do (except disabling one CPU)?
This never append on 2.1.131.
Need more info (debug) let me know soon, I'll be going back to Europe
later this week and would like to have this solve by then or will have
to go back to 2.1.131.
Thanks
Andre
