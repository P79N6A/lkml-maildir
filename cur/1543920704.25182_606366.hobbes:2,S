This is because the dma_data_direction enum type isn't available 
at the point the ia64 implementation is defined.

Changing the type of the last argument to dma_map_* functions 
to be a bitmask? Or adding an additional argument? (Both of 
which you mention below.)

I prefer the term "hack".

It'd be significantly more work to do change or add arguments 
to the dma_map_* functions. But if that's what I need to do to 
get this accepted, I'll back up and have another go at it.
