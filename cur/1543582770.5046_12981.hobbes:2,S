Well I would have done all this (mlock, alloc buffer in kernel space and map it to user space etc.). But the critical issue is that all should be code compatible to Win (ducking away...). The API under Win allows chain DMA from user space
so the program which was initially developed under Win uses this feature. My
module needs to jump in to support this. Another problem is that the buffer
is often reallocated.
