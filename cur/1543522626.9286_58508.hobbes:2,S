That is: you are using broken RAID implementation and expect it to work
somehow ?

It will not solve problem. RAID as it is in 2.2.x kernels us unstable and
unmaintained. You REALLY should use raid patches. There are some
incompatibilities with 2.2.x RAID implementation and latest RAID patches
and thus it's not going in 2.2.x but if you need working raid (and you do
hot have one) you SHOULD NOT use stock 2.2.x RAID. Use one from

P.S. Hmm. Stefan Monnier said back in september "Every serious NFS user uses
the patched knfsd, and every serious raid user uses the new raid code". Looks
like he was wrong after all :-/
