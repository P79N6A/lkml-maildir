Software mixing in the kernel probably _IS_ FPU ops in the kernel.   
We already do video mixing (think X) in userspace, I see no reason

Somone asked me why I work on this free (

philosophy/) software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Schulz  
had the best answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do  
it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.  
That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life."
