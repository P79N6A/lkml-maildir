I'm going to add in a 'me too!'.  Same cardbus card, different laptop.  I
get this oops for *ANY* card ejected from the laptop (the other card I have
is a pcmcia modem).  The term ejected here means either physically or using
cardctl eject.

I'm not sure about you, but the specific card driver is a module
(3c575_cb.o).  Mine works when I boot the laptop, maybe it's just the fact
that cardmgr knows that the driver isn't loaded and loads it.
