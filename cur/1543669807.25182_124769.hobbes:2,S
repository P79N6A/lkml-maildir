Some of them are in recent PATA and Jens Axboe implemented the TCQ for
IDE, but its all a bit limited right now

Its a common misconception that a disk looks something like it did 15
years ago. Your ATA disk is basically an entire standalone computer 
running a small OS. The physical disk layout does not divide neatly 
into equal sized cylinders and some blocks may even be in suprising
places due to bad block sparing or anything else the drive manufacturer
felt appropriate.
The drive firmware will look after a lot of the optimising for you,
and once it gets TCQ it will probably get you all you want from SCSI
with SATA. Until then playing games with it isnt likely to help - feed
IDE disks large, sequential I/O as much as possible and they'll deliver
you very nice numbers.
