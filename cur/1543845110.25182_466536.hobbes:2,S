Before I rush on a solution too fast... I have a question for you :
To protect code from being preempted, the macros preempt_disable and
preempt_enable must normally be used. Logically, this macro must make sure gcc
doesn't interleave preemptible code and non-preemptible code.
Starting with this hypothesis, what makes gcc aware of this ? If we check
preempt_disable (the disable call is almost symmetric) :
linux/preempt.h:
define add_preempt_count(val) do { preempt_count() += (val); } while (0)
#define inc_preempt_count() add_preempt_count(1)
#define preempt_disable() \
do { \
        inc_preempt_count(); \
        barrier(); \
} while (0)
So the magic must be in the barrier() macro :
linux/compiler-gcc.h:
/* Optimization barrier */
/* The "volatile" is due to gcc bugs */
#define barrier() __asm__ __volatile__("": : :"memory")
Which makes me think that if I put barriers around my asm, call, asm trio, no
other code will be interleaved. Is it right ?
