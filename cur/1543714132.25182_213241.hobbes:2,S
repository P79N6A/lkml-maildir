Yes, there are multiple problems with the bluetooth driver and the USB
system right now.  A number of them have been worked out, and should be
fixed in the -mm tree, but there are still a few left to be done to the
bluetooth driver itself, patches are available on the linux-usb-devel
mailing list for them to be blessed by the bluetooth maintainer.
It seems that lots of things broke this driver all at once, a few of
which were always bugs, but are just now getting hit due to timing
changes...
Sorry about this.
