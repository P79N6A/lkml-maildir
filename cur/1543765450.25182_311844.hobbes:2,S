That's because SMP makes a different architecture. So, let's not talk 
about SMP, beacuse it's not a problem.

Of course. When upgrading to kernel-2.6.10.i586.rpm? Why should you 
screw up the modules you've compiled? They all belong to 2.6 series.

It gives more freedom to change the implementation resulting in a easy 
mantainance. Modularity make things easy... little things that work, 
isn't it a unix motto? :)

Why always SMP! You are talking about porting a SPARC kernel on a 386! 
I'm talking about having the same binary kernel distribution for your 
achitecture, let's say i586, and being able to upgrade the kernel 
without hassles. No person on earth can imagine using a kernel for 
x86_64 on a i486! :)

I know, I was just wondering why kernel and modules were on different 
locations.

I always use a /boot partition. Anyway, /boot will always exist as /lib, 
and you can always do a rm -rf /boot/kernel/modules :)
