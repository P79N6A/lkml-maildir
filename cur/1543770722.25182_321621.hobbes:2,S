Subject: [PATCH 0/2] namespace naming cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following two patches are just renaming stuff.  It's in
preparation for bigger namespace changes, but obviously make sense on
their own.  Both were taken from Mike Waychison's autofs ng patches.
Please apply.
Thanks,
Miklos
