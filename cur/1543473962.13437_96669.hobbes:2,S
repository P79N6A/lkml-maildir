I suppose it is the streamer which causes the problems. So here's the output
of "scsiinfo -i /dev/st0":

I used the old driver ncr538/7xx to do the inquiries. If it helps I still
volunteer to crash my SCSI-bus again using the new driver and xcdroast
and/or write to /dev/st0. Then I would boot off an IDE-drive to keep the
system from hanging and to be able to record all the error messages.
