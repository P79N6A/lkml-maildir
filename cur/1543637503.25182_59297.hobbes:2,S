I upgraded to the latest RH 7.3 kernel (as per Bill's suggestion), removed
all NVidia drivers, booted up in runlevel 1 and tried to reproduce the
problem. After a couple of hours of copying 1 gig files between
partitions, it hasn't crashed. This could be thanks to a bugfix that went
into 2.4.18-5 (as opposed to 2.4.18-3), but I wouldn't count on it.
The problems I've experienced so far (crashes, fs corruption, etc) have
been irregular at best and sometimes when I've made a supposed fix (such
as disabling DMA), ran some test scripts for several hours which passed
without a problem -- only to get a crash or corruption a week later.
Anyway, I'll let the laptop shuffle files overnight and drop you guys a 
report if it does crash.
