I have to apologize for my stupidity and rapid response.  Forgive my
lack of sleep. I was staring at the wrong spinlock.h.
Indeed, linuxthreads do end up calling sigsuspend() when they fail to
acquire a mutex within a given time, and will/might receive a signal when
the mutex becomes available again. So at this level, there is kernel
level synchronization going on.
I need to think some more, obviously (!! :), about whether this is
enough to ensure correct order scheduling of a threaded pipeline on an
MP machine.
