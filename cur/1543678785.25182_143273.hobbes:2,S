In that case yes, you are screwed.  Your ABI just changed incompatibly.

No!  <linux/*.h> is the namesapce for kernelheaders.  Currently they're
still in the the user includes, too (due to legacy reasons).  The
DVD API must move to a directory outside <linux/dvb>.
If you userland packages add headers to /usr/include/linux/ they
are totally bogus.

And that's wrong.  You must always compile against the kernel headers
that your libc was compiled against.
