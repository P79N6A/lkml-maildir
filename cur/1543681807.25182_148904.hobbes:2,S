Con, I'll make a few notes on the code and a final comment.

Why did you bolt in the 40 value ? It really comes from (MAX_USER_PRIO - MAX_RT_PRIO)
and you will have another place to change if the number of slots will
change. If you want to clarify better, stick a comment.

I don't have the full code so I cannot see what "runtime" is, but if
"runtime" is the time the task ran, this is :
p->sleep_avg ~= p->sleep_avg + runtime / MAX_BONUS;
(in any case a non-decreasing function of "runtime" )
Are you sure you want to reward tasks that actually ran more ?
Con, you cannot follow the XMMS thingy otherwise you'll end up bolting in
the XMMS sleep->burn pattern and you'll probably break the make-j+RealPlay
for example. MultiMedia players are really tricky since they require strict
timings and forces you to create a special super-interactive treatment
inside the code. Interactivity in my box running moderate high loads is
very good for my desktop use. Maybe audio will skip here (didn't try) but
I believe that following the fix-XMMS thingy is really bad. I believe we
should try to make the desktop to feel interactive with human tollerances
and not with strict timings like MM apps. If the audio skips when dragging
like crazy a X window using the filled mode on a slow CPU, we shouldn't be
much worried about it for example. If audio skip when hitting the refresh
button of Mozilla, then yes it should be fixed. And the more you add super
interactive patterns, the more the scheduler will be exploitable. I
recommend you after doing changes to get this :
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/irman2.c
and run it with different -n (number of tasks) and -b (CPU burn ms time).
At the same time try to build a kernel for example. Then you will realize
that interactivity is not the bigger problem that the scheduler has right
now.
