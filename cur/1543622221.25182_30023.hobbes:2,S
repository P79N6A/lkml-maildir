Thanks, Robert.
Some background here - for the delayed allocation code which I'm
cooking up I need to globally count the number of dirty pages in the
machine.  Currently that's done with atomic_inc(&nr_dirty_pages)
in SetPageDirty().
But this counter (which is used for when-to-start-writeback decisions)
is unavoidably approximate.   It would be nice to make it a per-CPU
array.  So on the rare occasions when the dirty-page count is needed,
I can just whizz across the per-cpu counters adding them all up.
But how to increment or decrement a per-cpu counter?  The options
are:
- per_cpu_integer++;
  This is *probably* OK on all architectures.  But there are no
  guarantees that the compiler won't play games, and that this
  operation is preempt-safe.
- preempt_disable(); per_cpu_counter++; preempt_enable();
  A bit heavyweight for add-one-to-i.
- atomic_inc
  A buslocked operation where it is not needed - we only need
  a preempt-locked operation here.  But it's per-cpu data, and
  the buslocked rmw won't be too costly.
I can't believe how piddling this issue is :)
But if there's a general need for such a micro-optimisation
then we need to:
1: Create <linux/atomic.h> (for heavens sake!)
2: In <linux/atomic.h>,
   #ifndef ARCH_HAS_ATOMIC_INQ_THINGIES
   #define atomic_inc_irq atomic_inc
   ...
   #endif
But for now, I suggest we not bother.  I'll just use atomic_inc().
