Bah.  I moved ptrace_may_attach to fs/proc/base.c so that CONFIG_PTRACE=n
could just omit kernel/ptrace.c entirely and still get the function for
fs/proc/base.c to use (and because that uses it many more times than ptrace
does).  I'd forgotten that procfs could be disabled, since noone ever does.
What do people suggest?  It's not a very big function.
Thanks,
Roland
