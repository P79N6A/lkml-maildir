PS#1: I don't think we should require from users so much expertise
in bug reporting: after a few questions cc-ing should be no problem
here.
PS#2: Low Yucheng: maybe it's something else, but it seems your swap
could be bigger for this amount of memory. (You could try to monitor
this e.g. with "top" running in another console window.)
