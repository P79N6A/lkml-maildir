Both of them have to ensure you can make a consistent snapshot. Doing
that means you've got to be able to define a single "point" at which the
snapshot is made and is internally self-consistent. That in both cases
tends to mean you've got to ensure nothing occurs which pees on the image
while you are making that snapshot (such as outstanding O_DIRECT I/O to
user pages).
