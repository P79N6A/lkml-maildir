Note that the warning case we're discussing was really only about case
statements at the end of a compound statement.
In the middle of compound statements we're already fine: it's only the
corner case of a case "statement" without the statement that gcc
historically used to accept without warning, and that the gcc people only
recently noticed that they really shouldn't accept at all.
So that's why a comment and a "break" is equivalent. ONLY for the special
case of the new compile warning, though, obviously (see the subject line,
but yes, I should have made that more explicit).
