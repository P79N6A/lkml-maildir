but that's obviously not 'generic unpluggable kernel RAM'. It's very 
special RAM: RAM that is free or easily freeable. I never argued that 
such RAM is not returnable to the hypervisor.

but that's very easy to identify: check the free list or the clean 
list(s). No defragmentation necessary. [unless the unit of RAM mapping 
between hypervisor and guest is too coarse (i.e. not 4K pages).]
