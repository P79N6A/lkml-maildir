Subject: EXT3-fs error on kernel 2.4.18-pre3

Hi,
I just noticed that my file server running 2.4.18-pre3 + IDE patches &
NTFS patches has this error message in the logs:
EXT3-fs error (device md(9,4)): ext3_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in
datazone - block = 33554432, count = 1
This is the only ext3 error I have seen and the uptime is currently over
74 days. The error actually appeared two weeks ago. The timing coincides
well with when this device (/dev/md4, a MD RAID-1 array) ran out of
space, so it may well be related.
All seems to be working again after I freed up some space. Haven't run
fsck as I would hate to down the server with that nice uptime...
Should I be worried?
I am only mentioning this as I suppose it may be a bug somewhere in
ENOSPC handling, so perhaps someone is interested in this report...
