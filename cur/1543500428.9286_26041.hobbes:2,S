Hello.
I need to use request_module() to dynamically load some modules on demand
when a the top level driver loads.
Iam seeing some problem with symbol name resolution during loads.
Have module A, which exports a symbol for another module B.
in init_module() of A we call request_module("b"); results in that function
thats exported by A being undefined.
where as if i manually do 
insmod a
insmod b then there is no problem.
i have seen that if i remove the extern usage, then request_module works. is
this the expected behaviour? if so
how do we load modules using request_module() before using  them.
Cheers,
ashokr
