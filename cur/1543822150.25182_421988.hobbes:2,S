Actually, those macros translate straight into a single machine insn.
No firmware is involved.  See include/asm-powerpc/processor.h.  For
example:
#define HMT_very_low()   asm volatile("or 31,31,31   # very low  
priority")
You can use those same macros from user space, although it is CPU
implementation dependent which priorities you can actually set (you
probably can do low and medium priority).
