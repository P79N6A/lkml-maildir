Yes, well aware of both of those, plus a few minor problems
with scripts/kernel-doc itself.
I just added a minor rules-checker to the script and have
more plans for it.
We try to have new exported interfaces documented (I don't try
on static [private] interfaces).
I have had email with a professor in China who was going to have
some students do some work in this area, but I haven't heard back
from him (over 1 month ago).
