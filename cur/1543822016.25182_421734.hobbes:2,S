Keep up, folks, I dropped that position in the very first round of replies.

Yes, CRC-16 was a rhetorical device. MD4 would not have been. HZ=100
is not an exaggeration. Odds are pretty good you have such a Linux box
in the form of a router or such already. This completely invalidates
all the arguments about the hardware making the timing too
unpredictable as it does so on a timescale of microseconds or less.
