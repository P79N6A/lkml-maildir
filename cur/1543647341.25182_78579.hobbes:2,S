Well there was no one to respond to the NS,  so it couldn't figure out
what dest MAC address to shove in the ethernet packet.  Hence the
ethernet encap failed.
Say if you sent such a packet over the link to the router,  and it
tried to forward it without the neighbour being there,  you should
get an ICMP error generated.
But anyway it was trying to resolve a neighbour entry,  if someone
responded,  it'd have sent the packet.
Now try it with a box on the link which will respond to the NS for that
address.
