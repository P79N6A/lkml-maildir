The upper bound for softrr realtime scheduling isn't based on number of tasks, 
it's a global slice of cpu time: so long as the sum of running times of all 
softrr tasks in the system lies below limit, softrr tasks will be scheduled 
as SCHED_RR, otherwise they will be SCHED_NORMAL.

Not as implemented.  Anyway, from the user's point of view, that would be an 
unpleasant way for a sound player to fail.  What we want is something more 
like a little red light that comes on (in the form of error statistics, say) 
any time a softrr process gets demoted.  Granted, there may be situations 
where what you want is the right behavior, but it's (as you say) a separate 
issue of resource allocation.
