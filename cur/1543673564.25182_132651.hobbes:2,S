That's the one.  Process is sleeping on I/O in filemap_nopage(), wakes up
after the truncate has done its thing and the page gets instantiated in
pagetables.
But it's an anon page now.  So the application (which was racy anyway) gets
itself an anonymous page.
Which can still have buffers attached, which the swapout code needs to be
careful about.
