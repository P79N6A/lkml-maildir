You do not have to deal with TLB entries if you do buffered I/O.
For mmapped I/O you would want to transparently use 2M TLBs if the 
page size is large.

We currently have problems with the kernel limits of 128 SG 
entries but the fundamental issue is that we can only do 2 Meg of I/O in 
one go given the default limits of the block layer. Typically the number 
of hardware SG entrie is also limited. We never will be able to put a
