We probably don't need the timer.  wake_up_interruptible() does not
sleep; we can call it from anywhere.  Heck, timers are more atomic than
where we probably need to wake stuff up from anyhow.
But it is not easy to tell where that place is, because it looks like
the timer just runs every 250ms?  That is no good.
I suspect that we can remove all of the timer stuff and just do
	/* wake up!  you are going to miss the bus! */
	wake_up_interruptible(&dev->wait);
after
	list_add_tail(&kevent->list, &dev->events);
in inotify_dev_queue_event().
