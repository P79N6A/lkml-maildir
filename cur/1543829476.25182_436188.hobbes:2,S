I thought the posted write WILL eventually get to adapter memory.  Not
stall forever cached in a bridge.  I'm wrong?
My point is for a given HTXD entry, we write it to post a packet for
transmission, then only free the packet memory and reuse this entry
_after_ reading the HTXD and seeing the DONE bit set.  So I still don't
see a problem.  But I've been wrong before ;-)
