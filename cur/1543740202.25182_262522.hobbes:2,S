Current patch is at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/libata/patch.iomap.bz2
I still merging stuff, so won't get around to it for another day or so :)
I certainly don't mind anyone stealing the task from me, but the effort 
is larger than the other iomap conversions.  The patch above hits all 
the easily-picked fruit, leaving the stuff that requires a modicum of 
effort:
* map/unmap N PCI bars (N >= 4, per controller)
* map/unmap 2 ISA I/O regions (0x170, 0x1f0)
* accurately handle the odd situation where IDE driver steals 0x170 
while libata steals 0x1f0 (or vice versa), a.k.a. the reason for 
quirk_intel_ide_combined() and the ____request_resource nastiness
Currently the code is set up to handle:
* N PIO ports
	or
* a single MMIO address that contains all the registers the driver needs
(mmio_base)
