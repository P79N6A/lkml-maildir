These two are the main ones:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=408d85441cd5a9bd6bc851d677a10c605ed8db5f

They shouldn't be too hard to backport.
I'd be interested to know how OOM and page reclaim behaves after these patches
(or with a newer kernel).
Thanks,
Nick
