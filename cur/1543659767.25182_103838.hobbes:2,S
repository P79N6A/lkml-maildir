   A "read-mostly" section might be appropriate, then.  Of course, you'd
   have to split the structure, in that case, and it's not worth it if
   there are only a few of these.
   
   Have I finally got it through my thick skull now?
I think so.  A read-mostly section would allow us to exploit this
more for other things.
BTW, the tcp_hashinfo struct exists only because the linker could
otherwise legally reorder data section members.
