I get the same short freezes with
  cat /proc/acpi/battery/*/{state,info}
and also with the 'acpi' command-line tool.  I'm about to try the the
suggested kernel profiling with -mm3 and will report the results.
Meanwhile:
>>> readprofile -r
>> do i have to activate something special during kernel configuration?
>Set CONFIG_PROFILING=y
That confuses me.  For readprofile support,
Documentation/basic_profiling.txt says
  Add "profile=2" to the kernel command line.
For Oprofile support it says:
  Configure with CONFIG_PROFILING=y and CONFIG_OPROFILE=y
The two together suggest that CONFIG_PROFILING shouldn't be needed for
readprofile.
