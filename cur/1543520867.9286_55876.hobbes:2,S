I have tentatively searched the linux kernel archives for this subject, 
but haven't found anything.  I have heard that there is talk about 
moving this to 64 bits.  Has anyone considered this (stupid 
question) and who else is interested in this subject.  It seems to be 
a kernel and a glibc issue.  Since I am not currently subscribed to 
the list, please cc doug@springer.net for any replies.  When time 
allows, I intend to experiment with the 64 bit thing and see what 
breaks.
