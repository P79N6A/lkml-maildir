I don't think it deserves to be added in documentation, but just for
reference: in userspace "volatile" is needed in signals (posix mandates
some variables to be volatile, as API, not as funtionality). I don't
know if this was also on the original signal handling.
Anyway user space APIs are not kernel problem ;-)
