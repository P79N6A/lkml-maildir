You are right at the cacheline bouncing issue.  I will make that change.

I don't worry the ipc_ids.sem very much.  They are used to protect the
IPC info, which is not updated quiet often (by operation such as
semctl()). Significant IPC operations, like semop(), msgsnd() and
msgrcv(), need the access to the IPC ID, where only the ipc_lock() is
needed.

They look similar at the first glance. But they serve for different
purposes.  The ipc_ids.sem is used to protect the IPC infos, while the
ary_lock is used to protect the IPC ID array.  This way we could do
semctl() and semop() in parallel.

Thanks for point this out to me. I need to get ipc_lockall/ipc_unlockall
fixed.
