Due to a recently announced security issue with the current kernel, we
(the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.11.9 kernel.
It contains:
	- a fix for the posted problem
	- a revert of a patch in the last release that caused issues
	  with partitions (the bk changelog shows this as a i2c issue,
	  but that is a mistake as you can see from the real patch.)
	- addition of the SecurityBugs documentation
	- another security related fix that is already in 2.6.12-rc4.
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.  
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.11.8 and 2.6.11.9, as it is small enough to do so.
thanks,
greg k-h
