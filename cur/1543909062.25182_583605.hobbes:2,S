I actually did look for it, but couldn't find any lpfc commits with me
listed as author, so I assumed it had not been merged.
I just looked again, at the source this time, up-to-date mainline git
tree, and I still see
        hbqno = tag >> 16;
        if (hbqno > LPFC_MAX_HBQS)
                return NULL;
in drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_sli.c
