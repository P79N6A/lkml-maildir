This is actually not clear for me.

I tried but (on 2.4.2):
- request_region fails but, ignoring it and remapping physical address
to virtual, everything works fine, except for release_region, of course.
- request_mem_region works but what I get from communication with the
actual device are numbers that sometimes are surely wrong.
I couldn't understand what is the actual difference between
ioport_resource and iomem_resource to track the problem.
