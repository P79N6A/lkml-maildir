So, how are such companies any different from the myriad individuals
and companies that use Linux on the desktop or in their server rooms
without ever modifying it and who also contribute nothing back to the
community? They are also, in many (most?) cases taking advantage of
the free (as in beer) nature of Linux - saving money by using the work
of others without returning anything, but the product builders seem to
get a lot more abuse...
