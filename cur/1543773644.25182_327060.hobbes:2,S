Oh, god.  Let me try to explain this again:
  - This is a security issue with unprivileged mounts
  - Since no other filesystem currently offers secure unpivileged
    mounts in Linux, this is something "new"
  - Since it's something new, there's a big resistance to acceptance.
    I understand this, I only ask people, to please read
    Documentation/filesystems/fuse.txt, before arguing against it
  - IMO it's not a hack, and it's not something that can be solved
    otherwise (no, private namespaces are NOT a solution, they are
    mosty orthogonal to this).
So I welcome constructive discussion.  However bear in mind, that I
definitely don't want to disable unprivileged mounts.  For me that is
_the_ most important feature of FUSE.

More preciesly it relies on icache.

I won't shed many tears if you drop fuse-nfs-export.patch.  It would
at least give the userspace solution some boost.
However the patch is pretty small, and despite it's flaws, I know it's
used by a number of people.
Thanks,
Miklos
