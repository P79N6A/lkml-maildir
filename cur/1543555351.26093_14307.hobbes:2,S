I'll have to look up the register dump to analyze it. Would you test the
patch I sent you on top of 2.0e5, please?

Fixed in 2.0eX, BTW.

I tend to answer mails, where I know a solution very quickly, but tend to
not send messages like "Thanks I got your mail, I'll look into it!"
Actually, when I got some time to do some work, I look for yet unanswered
mails.

Test the patch on 2.0e5 I sent you, please.

That's at least something!

Nor can I. Actually, messages concerning drivers I maintain are sorted by
procmailrc to a different folder :-)

Should be fixed in 2.0e5 and later.

That's correct only if level triggered IRQs are used.

The 2.0d driver does not work correctly with 2.4, and I'm trying to make
sure 2.0f will be perfect. I don't see why Linus should refuse to accept
a patch.
