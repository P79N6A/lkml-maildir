Did someone figure out a fix for the inline problem ? In the gcc manual
it says:
"   If you specify both `inline' and `extern' in the function
definition, then the definition is used only for inlining.  In no case
is the function compiled on its own, not even if you refer to its
address explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as
if you had only declared the function, and had not defined it.
   This combination of `inline' and `extern' has almost the effect of a
macro.  The way to use it is to put a function definition in a header
file with these keywords, and put another copy of the definition
(lacking `inline' and `extern') in a library file.  The definition in
the header file will cause most calls to the function to be inlined.
If any uses of the function remain, they will refer to the single copy
in the library. "
 So I tried as the second paragraph suggests, and stuck copies of skb_put,
and skb_push in various files for which the functions were not getting
inlined. The kernel compiled, but didn't run worth a $%&!@#, and the
problems were with networking. So I think my fix was bad ?
