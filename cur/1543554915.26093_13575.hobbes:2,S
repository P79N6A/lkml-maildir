This (and ISA) is why PCs usually allocate only addresses that match
the following equation for PCI IO:
       (port >= 0x1000 && (port & 0x0300) == 0).
As you can see, the ports you list below all violate the second
criterion, they are thus "ISA equivalent ports".
The downside is that it's impossible to allocate more than 256
consecutive ports.
