while we're on the subject, what's the policy on supporting kernel
version selection *within* the 2.5 series?  as in:
$ grep -r "KERNEL_VERSION(2,5" *
drivers/scsi/pcmcia/nsp_cs.h:#if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,74))
drivers/scsi/pcmcia/nsp_cs.c:#if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,0))
drivers/scsi/pcmcia/nsp_cs.c:#if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,2))
drivers/scsi/pcmcia/nsp_cs.c:#if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE > KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,73))
... etc etc ...
granted, this doesn't happen in a lot of files (almost of them
SCSI-related), but is it official policy to support code based on its
release number in the 2.5 series of releases?  unless you have a good
reason, wouldn't it make more sense to compare against (2,6,0) rather
than, say, (2,5,73)?  just an observation.
