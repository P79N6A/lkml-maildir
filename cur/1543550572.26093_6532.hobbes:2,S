Just as they forced an official glibc-2.2 release through for the rh7
release? Maybe you should stop insulting the people who are actually
doing the Free Software work who just happens to be paid by Red Hat.
I would personally have preferred to see RH7 postponed at least until
glibc-2.2 was put out as a release candidate. gcc on the other hand I
don't expect to see being released anytime soon enough for it to make
sense (I might be wrong), and Richard is quite right about the C++
binary compat problems, so far nobody has even been able to agree on
the naming scheme of the shared libstdc++ package, we just have to
wait for 3.0.
