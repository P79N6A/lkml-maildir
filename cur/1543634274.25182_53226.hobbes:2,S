Looks like the dispsw isn't being set and you're running into the NULL
dereference in fbcon_cursor() upon trying to dereference it.. it looks like
fbgen.c is the culprit here, as it never sets display->dispsw if we aren't in
24-bpp or have FBCON_HAS_ACCEL set..
James, what's the point of th FBCON_HAS_ACCEL ifdef? It looks like all the
accel wrapper code does is provide a wrapper to the fillrect, imageblit, and
copyarea routines -- if the driver doesn't have accelerated ones to provide
for itself, it just uses the cfb_fillrect/imageblit/copyarea as a fallback,
thus it should _always_ be safe to call them.
If that's not the case, we'll have to re-introduce the FBON_CAS_CFBx
brain-damage in gen_set_disp() to keep dispsw happy.
