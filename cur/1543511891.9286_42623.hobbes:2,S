Subject: cannot load module char-major-4; but it's not a module

Whenever I boot, I get  cannot load module char-major-4;
but it's not compiled as a module. There is an alias for it in /etc/conf.modules
anyway, but why do I get these messages ? I use 2.2.12, but this has been
happening for almost all kernel versions back to 1994 when I started using
Linux.
Only when compiling serial device support as a module do the messages go away.
But I don't want it as a module.
