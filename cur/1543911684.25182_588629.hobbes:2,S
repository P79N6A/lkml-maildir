Hi, Guillaume,
The CSA code was written by Jay Lan, but I'll see if I can answer your
questions. In the current implementation, CSA does not use TGID exit
notifications. In fill_pid(), both bacct_add_tsk() and xacct_add_tsk()
are called (which is correct), they complement each other.
The code needs refactoring to ensure that they can work together
in the fill_tgid() scenario.

From what I understand, task->start_time and task->real_start_time
are taken from the realtime clock. The accounting in CSA seems
to be very similar to the accounting done in do_acct_process()
(kernel/acct.c).
Jay/Jonathan any comments?
