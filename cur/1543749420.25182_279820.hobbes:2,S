Subject: [PATCH 0/3] prio_tree generalization
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This patch set for 2.6.10-rc3-bk10 (*) generalizes the prio_tree
code such that other subsystems than just VMA can use it.
(*) I'm not sure which tree is the most useful base for this.
    Should I use 2.6.10-rc3-mm* instead of -bk* ? (Or is it
    already too late for 2.6.10 anyway ?)
While there are currently no other in-tree users than VMA,
the prio_tree algorithm will be useful for detecting overlapping
disk IO requests, which is a prerequisite for efficient handling
of barriers, which - besides being a good idea in general - in
turn is a prerequisite for useful disk IO priorities.
The three patches that follow are incremental and must be applied
in the order specified.
- Werner
