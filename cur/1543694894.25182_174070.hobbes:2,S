Hello Manuel,

I updated my patch for the av7110 DVB driver from LinuxTV.org and I can 
confirm that it works very well.
Recent updates are in
http://linuxtv.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/dvb-kernel/patches-2.6/
I usually set the timeout value to "60" and then manually load the 
firmware. Everything is ok, IMHO this patch can be submitted.
CU
Michael.
