For years now I have Logitec USB wheel mice running nicely with all last
versions of the Kernel and XFree.
Current Setup is Kernel 2.4.20 and XFree 4.3
Curious as I am I build a development kernel 2.5.66
But with that kernel the scroll wheel on the mouse seems not to work
anymore in XFree/Gnome.
dmesg reports
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1
looks good.
but both xev and mev report no event when moving the scroll wheel on the
mouse.
should mousewheel work with the dev kernels?
