I thought that is what I said in my original response, "kprobes should
be using its own notify chain to trap page faults, and the handler for
that chain should be optimized away when CONFIG_KPROBES=n or there are
no active probes".
Even the overhead of calling into a notify_page_fault() routine just to
do nothing adds a measurable overhead to the page fault handler
(according to Jack Steiner).  Since kprobes is the only code that needs
a callback on a page fault, it is up to kprobes to minimize the impact
of that callback on the normal processing.
