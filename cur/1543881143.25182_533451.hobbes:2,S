I have such a card in my box right now, and would definitely be happy to
test any changes.
I also have a couple of patches for the driver, but need to regenerate
the diffs and test them. Hopefully I can do that sometime this coming
week, and I'll be sure to CC you when I post them to linux-scsi ML.
Thanks
