in bash: help ulimit
ulimit: ulimit [-SHacdflmnpstuv] [limit]
     Ulimit provides control over the resources available to processes
     started by the shell, on systems that allow such control.  If an
     option is given, it is interpreted as follows:
         -S      use the `soft' resource limit
         -H      use the `hard' resource limit
         -a      all current limits are reported
         -c      the maximum size of core files created
         -d      the maximum size of a process's data segment
         -f      the maximum size of files created by the shell
         -l      the maximum size a process may lock into memory
         -m      the maximum resident set size
         -n      the maximum number of open file descriptors
         -p      the pipe buffer size
         -s      the maximum stack size
         -t      the maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
         -u      the maximum number of user processes
