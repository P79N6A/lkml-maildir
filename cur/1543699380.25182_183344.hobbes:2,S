Hi,
Here are some USB fixes for 2.6.0-test11.  They all fix real bugs, and
are 1-4 line fixes with the exception of the usb-serial close() fix,
which is a bit larger, but has been well tested by a number of different
users.
Please pull from:  bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/gregkh-2.6
Patches will be posted as a follow-up thread for those who want to see
them.
thanks,
greg k-h
