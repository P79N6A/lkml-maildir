In the 16550A UARTs I'm used to the FIFO irq threshold was programmable
at 1, 4, 8, or 14.  If set to one, it gives the system 14 or 15
character times to respond.  The 4.2.7 linux serial driver sets it
to 8, unless you modify the driver yourself as Jim and I have done
to set it to 1.

top kernel:     ide0: BM-DMA at 0xfcd0-0xfcd7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
top kernel: hda: TOSHIBA MK6409MAV, 6194MB w/0kB Cache, CHS=839/240/63, UDMA
brian@top brian>hdparm -v /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 839/240/63, sectors = 12685680, start = 0
I've always assumed this meant DMA was on and supported.  Is this
an adequate assumption?  Shall I turn on -u anyways?

I generally don't have these sorts of problems with my Hayes ESP
cards, or Cyclades multiport cards which have real hardware RTS/CTS
handling.  It is just hard to get these into my laptop. 8-)
Its nice to have a solid understanding of the problem.
