> Whenever I try to use the uinput sample program, I get an oops followed by a panic.  The problem also exists in 2.6.0-test3-mm1, but it's a little difficult for me to get the oops reports on my laptop without a serial port, so a report from 2.6.0-test1-ac3 is all I have.  I'm using uinput as a module, and preemptable or not, it still crashes.
i'm checking this, thanks Chad
