Subject: Strange ethN numbering problem.

On a system which has one Intel Ethernet 1 Gb interface, and 4 'Marvel', 
interfaces,
during kernel initialization the interfaces indicate they have 'normal' 
ethernet ethN names,
ie, eth0, eth1, eth2, eth3, eth4, eth5 are reported from the 'dmesg' output.
However, when the system comes up and attempt to do an ifconfig, the 
'ethN' numbers
have changed to a some what intermengled seriese starting with eth6... 
eth10.
I have never seen this sort of problem before, and so I have no clue 
what is causing
the later changes in the numbering scheme.
Does anyone have any idea where to look.
Thanks
John Clark
