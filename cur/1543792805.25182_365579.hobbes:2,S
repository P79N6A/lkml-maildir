Well, how do I found out? I tried switching to CFI, and it will not
boot (unable to mount root...). No mtd-related messages as far as I
can see. There's quite a lot of mtd-related config options, I set them
like this:

There's this kind of strange code in sharp.c; is it the thing I need
to rewrite into cfi_probe?
