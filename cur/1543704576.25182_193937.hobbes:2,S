I found out two things while trying to do this:
1. Many filesystems in linux set f_fsid to zero for statfs. I was trying 
to use this to skip over mount points, but that doesn't work. Had to use 
the st_dev field from stat instead. :(
2. Swapfiles apparently don't like to be touched. I did an 
ioctl(FIGETBSZ) on a swapfile, and it would simply block until I did a 
swapoff on the file. I didn't even get to the FIBMAP part. :( Is this 
correct behaviour? And is there any way to detect this so that I can 
work around it?
