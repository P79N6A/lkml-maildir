I'm seeing this long (198) thread and just have no idea how it has
ended (wiki? hand-mailing?).
Just two general questions to Adrian.
1) You was maintainer of the woody backports, isn't it[0]? Why you didn't
proposed (used) Debian's BTS as alternative to bugzilla, and how you did
your regression tracking?
What exactly doesn't fit? Full control by e-mail, comprehensive
management, ML handling/redirection, tagging, sorting, searching? Finally,
reportbug tool and web-inteface?
2) Your decision to stop activity, was that with debian because Sarge was
release with known security hole in the kernel[1]?
I'm just wonder.

    Unfortunately this message is from a man, who was punished in very
    unfair manner by "fellow developers". I'm not trying to rise this
    issue (sorry, if i'm trolling), just want to say, that life can be
    very unfair, when some wrong people are in power...
