+	BUG_ON(list == NULL);

+	BUG_ON(list->prev == NULL);
these checks are not needed - they'll trivially be oopsing when trying to
use them, right?
+	BUG_ON(list->next->prev != list);
+	BUG_ON(list->prev->next != list);
these two are indeed nice to have.
+	BUG_ON((list->next == list) && (list->prev != list));
+	BUG_ON((list->prev == list) && (list->next != list));
arent these redundant? If list->next->prev == list and list->prev->next ==
list, then if list->next == list then list->prev == list. Ditto for the 
other rule.
so i think we only need the following two checks:
+	BUG_ON(list->next->prev != list);
+	BUG_ON(list->prev->next != list);
and we could as well add these unconditionally (no .config complexity
needed), until 2.6.0 or so, hm?
