  i just *know* i'm going to regret asking this, but is there a
compelling reason why the internal contents of a "menuconfig FUBAR"
needs to still be surrounded by a "if FUBAR" condition?  wouldn't it
be philosophically cleaner if the internals of a menuconfig structure
*automatically* depended on selection of the menuconfig and the "if"
part was implicit?
  and having said that, i realize that there are menuconfig examples
for which the above is not strictly true, but i can't remember where
i've seen them.  all i remember about them is that they we're a bit
confusing.
