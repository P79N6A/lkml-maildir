The problem AFAIK it's clear: Swap in is slow by nature because it's random. Well, it "looks"
like it should be random. Now that would be a interesting thing to analyze: locality of the
swapped-in stuff for different worloads - if the swapped-in stuff has some locality, then
it certainly should possible to fix the swapin code to do some kind of "swapahead". But if
the stuff is swapped in completely randomly, only stuff like swap prefetch is going to help.
The good thing about swap prefetch is that it fixes the problem today without forbidding
future improvements to the VM.
