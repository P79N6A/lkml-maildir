Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.3-ac10: sanitize_e820_map()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Summary:
   print bad BIOS maps (those containing overlaps in memory regions).
Kernel:
   linux-2.4.3-ac10
Description:
   This change informs the user when overlaping memory regions are
   found in an e820 memory map.  If overlaps are found, the mapping is
   displayed and then an adjusted map is created (without overlaps).
   If no overlaps are found, the original mapping is left untouched.
