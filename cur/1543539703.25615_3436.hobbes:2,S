Can you please send to the list a copy of this email in
Postscript and PDF format as well?  A copy in LaTeX would be nice
too.  I like to get all my email in every existing document
format, just in case.  My mail reader doesn't understand ASCII
or HTML you see, so I had to run html2pdf and pdf2ps in order to
read it.
Thanks in advance.
