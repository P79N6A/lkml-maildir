I sure hope that Michael knows what's going on here, because these
changelogs aren't very useful.  They tell us *what* the patch does (which
was pretty obvious anyway) but they don't tell use *why* it was done.
The patches were rather wordwrapped so a resend would be needed anyway
please.    Some improved changelogging at the same time would be nice.
