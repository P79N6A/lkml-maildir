Hello,
i have a Problem with my ISA Soundcard (Terratec maestro 32/96  with cs4232
chipset) under kernel 2.2.12 with OSS or ALSA. When i play soundfiles (mp3, wav) the
sound dies with this error im /var/log/messages "Sound: DMA (output)
timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?", but there are no IRQ/DMA conflicts.
I have tried it with module support and compiled into the kernel.
Under kernel 2.0.x there are no problems. 
sorry for my bad english
thx
Bruno
