> 4) Multicast: Alan, I have a patch for this on the web site and Jochen has just sent me a patch to enable Option 2 multicasting in ibmtr. (I only did the main token ring code to get it to work with the olympic driver), I can put these together and send you a diff.
Please do. I'll drop it into 2.2/2.3
> 5) IPv6, Jochen has also recently supplied the IPv6 over token ring as well.  I can also send this to you if interested (or Jochen can sent it direct, whatever works).
This one needs to get into 2.3.x only I think.
