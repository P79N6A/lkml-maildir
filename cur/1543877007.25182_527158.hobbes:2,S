According to this post:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/9/475
with 2.6.21-rc3, it started working after the kernel disabled NCQ 
because of too many errors. That seems to point away from it being an 
IRQ problem, as you'd expect it to not work at all. I don't expect the 
interrupts would be handled any differently between NCQ and non-NCQ 
commands. However, apparently disabling ACPI also prevents the problem, 
which does seem a bit odd.
