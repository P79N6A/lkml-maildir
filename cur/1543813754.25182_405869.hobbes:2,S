Well, I found it. Finally. I diffed memalloc.c in the alsa kernel tree
with alsa stable 1.0.10 and googled for the obvious two chunks that
stood out :-)
It's apparently an old issue, see here and follow the thread:
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/21/9
So, 1.0.10 obviously did not include these two patches:

With this in a short remote test 1.0.10 on top of 2.6.15-rt21 does not
generate the bad page messages I originally reported. Woohoo!
And 1.0.11rc3 apparently only includes one of the two patches. 
]# find . -type f -exec grep GFP_COMP {} \; -print
#ifndef __GFP_COMP
#define __GFP_COMP      0
./include/adriver.h
        gfp_flags |= __GFP_COMP;        /* compound page lets parts be
mapped */
                | __GFP_COMP    /* compound page lets parts be mapped */
./alsa-kernel/core/memalloc.c
I'll test 1.0.11rc3 asap to confirm whether adding the missing bit makes
a difference or not. I think I was getting the exact same error on
1.0.11rc3 but I have to make sure. 
Thanks for all the help!
