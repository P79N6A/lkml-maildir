This is mainly a problem with the SCSI subsystem, rather than anything
else. The SCSI subsystem is not very good at feeding the requests to
different disks, much less different controllers.
The basic IO-request queue is fairly simple, and it's certainly not
perfect, but most of the problems are actually at a different layer. One
obvious one is the SCSI subsystem that forces everything to be on one
queue.
