I'm not yet sure how to do it best.
The trivial way is really trivial, allocate a set of 1536-byte
buffers and make a swap+copy on RX and TX, but I want to
investigate the data-coherent approach first.

No, I have a nice experimental machine so there is no problem
with that. I'd have to recompile my tools (GNU suite and rest
of the system) LE, but it's a simple thing, too.
I just want to have the functional drivers in the tree and
only then improve them. Doing all the work in a single step
is just impossible, the target moves way too fast (at least
for my limited time budget).
