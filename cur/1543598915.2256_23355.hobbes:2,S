I've been running the A7A266 w/ PC133 for a few months, and am very happy
with it.  (It is supposed to support DDR too, but I have not tried it.)
A bit pricey for a m.b., but it works.
FWIW, it uses the ALi M1647 north and ALi M1535D+ south.  The kernel
mis-recognizes the latter as a ALI15X3, but it still works.
And since we're on the subject (again), I'll mention (again) that I have a
couple of bogo-howtos for this board at
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/bdbryant/howtos/hardware/asus-a7a266/.
Good luck,

p.s. - Browse the archives carefully before buying any Athlon m.b. with a VIA
chipset.
