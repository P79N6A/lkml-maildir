you are wrong again. I sent you the numbers earlier today already:
|   PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
|  2332 mingo     25   0  1580  248  196 R 95.1  0.0   0:11.84 loop
|  2335 mingo     39  19  1576  244  196 R  3.1  0.0   0:00.39 loop
3.1% is 3067% more than 95.1%, and the ratio is 1:30.67. You again deny 
above that this is the case, and there's nothing i can do about your 
denial of facts - that is your own private problem.
