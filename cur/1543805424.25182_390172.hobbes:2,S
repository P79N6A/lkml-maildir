I can fix this without changing the flags size for those architectures.
1. Introduce *_le_bit() bit operations which takes void *addr
   (already I have these functions in the scope of
    HAVE_ARCH_EXT2_NON_ATOMIC_BITOPS in my patch)
2. Change flags to __u8 flags[4] or __u8 flags[8] for each architectures.
3. Use *_le_bit() in include/linux/thread_info.h
