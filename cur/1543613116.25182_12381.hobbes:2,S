Well, this driver does only support 32 Ports. everyone more crashes   
definitely. I haven't seen such a broken source in years. I urge you  
to delete the device nodes above 31 to overcome any chance to crash   
again.                                                                
Most interestingly the moxa-driver is better by far than the mxser. It
seems to me the mxser is _really_ old. If you want to help us all,    
please try to contact moxa support and tell them it is high time to   
submit a _new_ mxser.c to the kernel tree, because the old (currently 
used) one is such a mess. They can do better (proven in moxa.c).      
At least a multiboard setup is completely broken. My patch fixes this 
but this does not help the main kernel tree.                          
I cannot submit a patch to marcelo, because I am not the maintainer,  
and we all don't want to fork a new mxser-driver apart from the       
original.                                                             
Oh dear.                                                              
Regards,
