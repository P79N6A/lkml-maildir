Memory sizing for old machines whose BIOSen don't speak E820
got broken in 2.4.0-test13-pre4:

(This snipped is in setup_memory_region() where legacy (e801 or 88)
memory size info is converted to e820-style.)
BIOS call 0x88 returns extended (above 1M) memory size not total, so
the subtraction "- HIGH_MEMORY" is wrong. The effect is that the
kernel believes the machine to have 1MB less RAM than it actually has
-- not fun on an old 486 with limited RAM to start with :-(
I think this patch should be backed out pronto.
