	Can anybody tell me if there are any digital cameras that work
   under Linux, preferably that aren't tied to the PC hardware
   architecture, preferably in the megapixel range?
Check out the support listing at

I personally use an Olympus (which btw has an embedded
Sparc inside :-) on an Ultra10, it speaks over a serial
line.
