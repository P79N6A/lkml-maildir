"mount-table" (fs/namespace.c:mount_hashtable) is consulted only when
path-resolution crosses dentry marked as mount-point (has non-zero
->d_mounted field), which is rare, and this means that number of
elements in mount_hashtable has little effect on the cost of path-name
resolution.
Unless, of course, by "polluted" you mean that output of "cat
/proc/self/mounts" becomes longer.
Nikita.
