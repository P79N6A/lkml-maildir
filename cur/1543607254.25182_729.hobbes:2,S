With strace ls, output of ls is not very usable. So this doesn't match.

With hiding of messages during boot, you won't ever have an idea to _run_
the dmesg!

They can also help to presume problems on the horizon and then seeking for
the cause of them... one might say... ah, wait a minute, now i remember,
during bootup i glanced there, and there was something about DMA errors,
wtf is that? can't it be a problem?

and when they hide them, they will say "it didn't do anything. dunno where
it stopped. to run it with li..what? loot_virboss:zero? excuse me?"

if you want to force one not to see them even if he might want once time,
but dunno how to turn them on...

debug messages don't add complexity. optionality of them does. :P
as someone said here, this is also a psychological issue, the feeling of
common secret knowledge, the feeling of speciality, the cool matrix-like
look which make you look as geek and expert, the mysterious messages which
will actually tell you everything what that thing does, does it matter
that you don't understand it? it looks cool so it is good :P and you said
they won't even read it, so they won't have a feeling of informations
overhead, so they won't hate or fear the computer, just like it that it
is willing to tell them what is going on, if they would ever want to listen...
