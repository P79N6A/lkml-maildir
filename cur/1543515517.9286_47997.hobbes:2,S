If you add "kcalloc" instead of hacking "kmalloc" as I did, drivers
wanting zeroed pages make the conscious decision of calling another
function, with a potentially slower path.
Such a split would also make it easier to enumerate
architecture-dependent paths.  For some architectures may choose the
default -- kmalloc+memset -- and other archs can choose a page-zeroing
idle task, all without affecting kmalloc/kmem_cache_alloc
