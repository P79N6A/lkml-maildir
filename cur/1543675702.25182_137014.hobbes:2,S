I am here experiencing almost same behavior, but I didnt collected enough
data to isolate the problem
few points:
1. It is new acpi code, backported by alan in latest -ac. Previous (2.4)
acpi "works" (err, it's outdated and more but at least no interrupt storm).
I didnt tried running 2.5 on the target machine yet.
2. all other devices working fine. The only visible things are slow mouse
responsiveness and >60k interrupts per second at vmstat output
The box is p4-based fujitsu scenic. More information is available on request.
And I will try 2.5 on it soon.
