Subject: [PATCH] n_tty.c buglet breaks error returns
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The tty SIGIO fix that went into 2.4.19 breaks error returns from the 
underlying driver.  Currently, any errors from the driver causes write_chan
to call schedule() rather than returning the error.
This broke the UML test suite, the fix below makes it work again.
