Well, the reason behind this patch is just adding a little bit of
cleanup code (ie., cleaning the 'lo' object) to the case when the
kernel thread creation fails, regardless of what implementation
loop_set_fd() uses to accomplish this.
In fact, I think the concept it's still usable after applying the
patch you mentioned, since after changing kernel_thread() for
kthread_create(), the only cleanup code added is setting lo->lo_thread
to NULL.
