I have currently no idea whats going on with the cflags. power3 and g5
fails for me with current binutils and hammer branch.
g5 needs the altivec option, because -maltivec -mppc64bridge  will disable
altivec again in as. And arch/ppc/kernel/Makefile adds -mppc64bridge
after the cflags in arch/ppc/Makefile. Maybe the EXTRA_CFLAGS can be
removed from arch/ppc/kernel/Makefile?
plain rc3 with g5 32bit (and power3) .config gives this:
  gcc -m32 -Wp,-MD,usr/.initramfs_data.o.d -nostdinc -iwithprefix include -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude  -Iarch/ppc -D__ASSEMBLY__ -Iarch/ppc -mppc64bridge    -c -o usr/initramfs_data.o usr/initramfs_data.S
cc1: error: invalid option `ppc64bridge'
this comes from aflags-$(CONFIG_PPC64BRIDGE) in arch/ppc/Makefile
