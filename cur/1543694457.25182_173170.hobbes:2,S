Hi,
I've released the 003 version of udev.  It can be found at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-003.tar.gz
udev is a implementation of devfs in userspace using sysfs and
/sbin/hotplug.  It requires a 2.6 kernel to run properly.
There have been a number of major changes since the last release:
	- works properly with the current 2.6 kernel (older versions of
	  udev will not work with the current 2.6 kernel.)
	- persistent database support has been added, but not fully
	  integrated (tdb is database code, very nice stuff.)
	- lots of documentation has been added.
	- spec file has been added for building rpms.
	- install and uninstall support added to Makefile to make it
	  easier to install and test with.
	- hard coded config file paths have been fixed.
	- callout support has been added (allows other programs to be
	  run to determine what to name a device.)
	- cross compile bugs fixed.
	- TODO list expanded for those who wish to help out.
	- lots of other stuff fixed.
The full ChangeLog is below.
The new udev FAQ is included in this release, and can also be found at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug/udev-FAQ
Development of udev is done in a BitKeeper tree available at:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/udev/
If anyone ever wants a snapshot of the current tree, due to not using
BitKeeper, or other reasons, is always available at any time by asking.
thanks,
