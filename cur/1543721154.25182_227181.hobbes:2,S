Hello,
I posted a problem with 2.6.7-rc3 :
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108704073817936&w=2
which I thought was about usb, but I now think it's about partition as I
got:
Jun 12 13:26:25 greg kernel:  sdg: unknown partition table
While under 2.6.7-rc2 I have :
Jun 12 13:40:01 greg kernel:  sdg: sdg1 sdg2 sdg3 sdg4
I have just tried 2.6.7-rc3-mm2 which gave me the same result...
All my SCSI and IDE discs works perfectly, even my 8-1 cards readers
works, only problem is with my apacer Steno 512Mb.
Any hope to have it fixed ?
Thank to CC to me as I am not on this ml :-)
