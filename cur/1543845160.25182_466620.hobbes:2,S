If we can do that with PCI quirks, why the need to hard-code it in the
IDE driver too?
And IRQ zero isn't particularly helpful suggestion -- using an invalid
IRQ number would be better. Like NO_IRQ or IDE_NO_IRQ, which should be
-1.
Don't make me dig out the board where the PCI slots all get IRQ 0 :)
