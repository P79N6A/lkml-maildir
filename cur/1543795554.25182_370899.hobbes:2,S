Nope.  Your system is overheating, and on-board temperature sensors are 
complaining.  Probably you should find whether lm-sensors have drivers for chips 
your motherboard has, and look at sensors output in that case...
Maybe ACPI could report thermal zone as well, try looking at 
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/* tree.
