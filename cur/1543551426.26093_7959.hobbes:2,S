   page_table_lock is supposed to protect normal page table activity (like
   what's done in page fault handler) from swapping out.
   However, grabbing this lock in swap-out code is completely missing!
Audrey, vmlist_access_{un,}lock == unlocking/locking page_table_lock.
You've totally missed this and thus your suggested-patch/analysis
needs to be reevaluated :-)
