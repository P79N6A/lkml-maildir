opensolaris is open source, you can look at their code.
But I don't think you'll find an answer there. My bet is: because
it'd be more difficult for their customers (even if opensolaris
is opensource it was born as propietary OS), because doing it
doesn't buys you performance and customers, there're not
lot of reasons for doing it, etc.
As I understand it, linux is "different". I'd say that the main
"philosophic" (not technical) reason for going 4K is: "because
we have the balls to write a 4k-stack-safe kernel". Quoting Linus:
"I hold open source people to higher standards. They are supposed to be
 the people who do programming because it's an art-form, not because it's
 their job."
