Nah! It is the device drivers responsibility to allocate enough
space. So if a new SCSI disk driver notices 20 disks, and therefore
wants 320 minors, it should allocate the array to be 320 entries.
But indeed as soon as the 8bit restriction on minors is lifted, nobody
will allocate the minors close together anymore, leading to sparsely
used arrays.
