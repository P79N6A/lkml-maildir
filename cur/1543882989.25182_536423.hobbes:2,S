Right. I think.

Well, I think we could always add a pte argument to flush_icache_page...
Then, there might be logic to have a flush_lazy_icache_page when
changing protections, but that operation (currently called
lazy_mmu_prot_update) really doesn't seem like it should be called in
all the other places that it is, flush_icache_page should be used for
that.
But AFAIKS, if we really want correctness, flush_icache_page should go
away and be implemented in flush_dcache_page.

Well flush_icache seems to be intended solely to bring icache in sync
with dcache modifications, but they try to skimp out on most of the
flushes required to handle dcache aliases... but really, I don't think
that is possible to do 100% correctly.
