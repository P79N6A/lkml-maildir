Hi,
I am using two ppp lines in an eql connection, and I would like to monitor
it via snmp, but it can't get the statistics of the interface. Even the
output of ifconfig shows wrong data (compared to the interfaces of the ppp
lines). I would like to see the sum of the packets and bytes sent over
the ppp interfaces in the eql interface. Did I miss something, or this
feature isn't implemented yet?
Thanks.
