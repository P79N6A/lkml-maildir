Ok, the disk does buffering itself (but it has less memory than . But will it 
do read ahead when
there is a request to do something else waiting?
Will it continue to read when it should have moved?
(Note: lets assume that the disk are never out of requests)
When it moves. The arm has to move and the platter will rotate to the right
spot - lets see. You can start reading directly when you are at the right
track. It can be stuff needed later... (ok, latency can be ignored)

Note: the 32 MB/s is for reading two big file sequentially.
(first one then the other)
If I instead do a diff the two files the throughput drops
2.4.0 gave around 15 MB/s
2.4.7 gave only 11 MB/s
2.4.8-pre3 give around 25 MB/s (READA higher than normal)
2.4.9-pre2 gives 11 MB/s
2.4.9-pre4 gives 12 MB/s
My patch against 2.4.8-pre1 gives 28 MB/s
