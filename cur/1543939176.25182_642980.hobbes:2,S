Oh, that is very interesting issue.
tank you good point out.
after deep thinking, I understand my current implementation is fully stupid.
current, worst case is below.
  1. low end
     - many process of used only a bit memory(sh, cp etc..) exist.
     - 1 memory eater process exist(may be, it is fat browser)
       and it watching /dev/mem_notify.
  2. high end
     - many process of used only a bit memory(sh, cp etc..) exist.
     - 1 memory eater process exist(may be, it is DB)
       and it watching /dev/mem_notify.
the point is "only 1 process watch /dev/mem_notify", but not a few processor.
I fix it with pleasure. 
> timeout = info->last_proc_notify + min(mem_notify_users, PROC_WAKEUP_GUARD);
I like this formula.
the rest problem is decide to default value when only 1 process watch /dev/mem_notify.
What do you think it?
and if my low end worst case situation doesn't match yours, 
Could you please explain your usage more?
BTW: 
end up, We will add /proc configuration the future.
but I think it is too early.
sometimes configrable parameter prevent the discussion of nicer default value.
Instead, I hope the default value changed by adjust your usage.
