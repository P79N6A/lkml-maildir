No it does not.
I have nearly the same setup (ASUS P5W-DH-Deluxe, Core2, 2GB RAM, 3
SATA and 2IDE)
And a "dmesg | grep irqpoll does not show up with results.
dmsg | grep 23 comes up with:
wifi0: Atheros 5212: mem=0xeb9f0000, irq=23
And I no longer use IRQPOLL (I dropped it somwhere between 2.6.22.?
and 2.6.23) as Kernel option.
kernel (hd0,0)/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda3 video=nvidiafb:1280x1024-32@85,mtrr,ywrap
All SATA Ports are working (except the the PMP... it "works" but I
would not recomment usign it right now because of these bugs:
