Rate limit: current values, sysadmin knows when something's wrong or
            application knows when something's wrong (depending if you
            block or not when the limit is exceeded).
Caching: approximate values, sysadmin is not notified (unless something
         like ioctl/second is available somewhere), application is not
         notified.
