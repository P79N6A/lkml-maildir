Documentation doesn't a feature make. It seems odd that the kernel
would not know where a filesystem is mounted. The kernel, more than
anything else, ought to be aware of filesystem mount points.
BTW, /var/shm is a bad default. Stuff like this should be right on
the root because /var may be a separate filesystem that gets mounted
after the system already needs shared memory. (it would be even
better to let this filesystem hang loose, active but not part of
the normal tree at all)
