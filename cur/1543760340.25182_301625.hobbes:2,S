Somewhat Greg, it caught me out.  OTOH, once we know that .2 needs .1, 
we'll be ok.  And it does give a quick method for us frogs to define 
if one of them is a regression.  The only thing that should break if 
we leave one out of the squence is the EXTRAVERSION path in the 
Makefile & we can certainly fix that easily enough for testing.
Question?  Is it a given that these, if they don't have warts, will be 
in mainline 2.6.12?
