Not need to go quite that far.  It is not necessary to recompile the
entire kernel nor do you need to boot a kernel to get the source code
for an instruction.
cd linux
rm drivers/net/3c59x.o
make CFLAGS_3c59x.o=-g vmlinux
s=$(sed -ne '/vortex_probe1/s/ .*//p' System.map | tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]')
e=$(echo -e "obase=16\nibase=16\n$s+500" | bc)
objdump -S --start-address=0x$s --stop-address=0x$e vmlinux
That recompiles just 3c59x.o with -g and dumps the first 0x500 bytes of
vortex_probe1, including the source code.
