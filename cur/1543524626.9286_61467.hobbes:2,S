Can you elaborate on this point?  Last time I checked it worked
here.  What size of file are you creating?  Looking through
trunc_tindirect, it operates on block sizes.  It's using an int, so if the
file is incredibly large, there will be a sign problem.

To use lfs you really just need a new glibc that knows about stat64 --
recent versions of most utilities compile themselves to use the 64 bit
loff_t.

Actually you probably want the patch below -- only mark the super block
dirty if the bit wasn't already set.  This is what's done in 2.2, I'm not
sure how I missed this -- probably because my superblock already had the
compat bit set... =)
