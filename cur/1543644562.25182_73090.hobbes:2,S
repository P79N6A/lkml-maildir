On the intel side I'm ready to ask for hardened hardware.
Maybe it's just the high volume but it feels like to use any piece
of intel hardware I half to use arounds for hardware bugs.
A lot of the problems feel like someone was doing a rush, job to meet
some marketing window.
My current favorite is the ICH3 I have my choice.  I can either monitor
Xeon temporatures via the i2c/smbus interface or I can reliably reset
the machine.
The useful point here is no amount of abstract talking about
hardening the hardware is going to reveal issues like these.  Only
testing and debugging.  And keeping both the hardware and the software
simple is an important piece of preventing bugs.

O.k. Then why not just fix the buggy hardware?

Does fixing intel hardware bugs count?

Oh, and don't forget that the hardware specification that drivers are
written to, many times are not generally available greatly reducing 
the pool of capable people who have the opportunity to review the and
debug the drivers.  I would make it a requirement for a hardened
driver that both the code and the hardware documentation be publicly
available so the code can easily be reviewed by as many people as wish
to.

I will agree with that sentiment.
