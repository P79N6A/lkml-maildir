Why? The load image for the new process does not require relocation, so all
that's necessary to spawn a process is to allocate a spaceID, map the
excutable to that ID in the page tables, push one entry into the TLB, set a
couple of hardware registers, and insert it into the readyq. When it get's
control it will prompty fault in its code pages (if not already present),
and execution from there on is normal. This process is essentially identical
to what happens on a conventional, except because there is no aliasing of
addreses (flat unified 64-bit model) you don't have to scrub the cache or
TLB.

Do you know why? Can you point me to the people who did these ports so I can
ask?

In 1) I'm talking about the driver's local state, not the pages it's trying
to fill. That local state will be in the driver's space, and protected from
interference by everybody else.
The pages (I assume) are arguments to the driver, i.e. "Fill *here*", and
the owner of the page will have exposed the page to the driver before or as
part of making the call. Or the call was "Fill some page and return it", and
the driver calls the physmem manager who allocates the page, exposes it to
the driver, and reurns the address to the driver. When the driver is done it
will hand off ownership of the page to the client.  I fully expect that the
present code for this mechanism will have to be mangled, but I suspect that
the kernel already implements some concept of "owner" for a physpage and we
can hook the ownership transfer into our model.
I hope :-)
