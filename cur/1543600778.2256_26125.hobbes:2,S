Are you saying that Linux should implement compability with _new_
features in FreeBSD 4.x, while at the same time frowning at the fact
that Linux introduces a new API?! The mind boggles at the thought.
Please accept, that sometimes, just sometimes, there is a superior way
to do something, and implementing support for that might not be such
a bad idea after all. Whining about this causing "bloat and maintainance
nightmares" (no, not a direct quote, sorry for that) doesn't cut it,
because there are probably more Linux-machines running the software than
any BSD-machines, thus the netlink-code will get _more_ testing than
the legacy API.
