Would I have to run mklost+found on /proc? Would it be a 12k directory
like every other lost+found?
And, would one have to run fsck.proc to get the zombies in there?

Might I suggest a /proc/0/... tree of process information? (task[0] is
the kernel after all.)  It would help reduce the clutter in /proc.  It
would take a minor change to psmisc to prevent it from scanning it as
a regular process assuming the regular process information isn't filled
in. (It'd look something like the NT "System Idle" process which people
may rightly resist.)
