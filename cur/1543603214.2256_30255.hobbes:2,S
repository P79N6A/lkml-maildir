Hello,
I have the following error message when I try to compile the 2.4.9
kernel. Could you help me ?
[root@lxusa linux]# make menuconfig
scripts/Menuconfig: line 11:  1872 Segmentation fault      (core dumped)
cat  <<EOM
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
EOM
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu0: command not found
scripts/Menuconfig: line 19:  1874 Segmentation fault      (core dumped)
cat  <<EOM
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
EOM

Thank in advance for your answer
