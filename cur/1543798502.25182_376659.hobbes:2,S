But not very.
Look at it from the POV of major architectures: there's no way the new
mutex code will be faster than down() and up(), so we're adding a bunch of
new tricky locking code which bloats the kernel and has to be understood
and debugged for no gain.
And I don't buy the debuggability argument really.  It'd be pretty simple
to add debug code to the existing semaphore code to trap non-mutex usages. 
Then go through the few valid non-mutex users and do:
#if debug
	sem->this_is_not_a_mutex = 1;
#endif
