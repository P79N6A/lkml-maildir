Plodding through the release notes for 2.2.12 to 2.2.17 I find 2.2.14
contains
    Dcache Scaling 
        The dcache hash is scaled by memory size.
    Dcache corruption 
        A specific very rare case of dcache corruption has been fixed. 
I'd like to find more detail of the rare corruption so I can see if it
matches what we're experiencing, is it more likely with an SMP machine,
etc.  Is there an archive of patches that go into a particular version
anywhere?
Ralph.
