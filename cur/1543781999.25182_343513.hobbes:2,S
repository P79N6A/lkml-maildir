Hi James, how are you?
Is this the only use _you_ could find for a *radix tree*? ;-)
Since of course sd.c uses it just as an enumeration, according to
you this must be the only use? :-)
It was designed as a general purpose id to pointer translation
service, just as the comment in it says.

James, I'm sure you're well aware that,
   - a request_queue is LU-bound,
   - a SCSI _transport_ (*ANY*) can _only_ address domain devices, but
     _not_ LUs.  LUs are *not* seen on the domain.
See the different associations?  Then why are you posting such emails?
Andrew, please apply this patch.
Thanks,
     Luben
