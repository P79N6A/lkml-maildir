Yes, we know.
You use an old version of mount, and the mount will always fail.
Two solutions:
(i) Do not use CONFIG_BLK_STATS.
(ii) Upgrade mount to a recent version (mount is part of util-linux,
recent is for example 2.11y).
Note that solution (ii) gives you a situation where mount and fdisk
fail sporadically instead of always, maybe not precisely what one
had hoped. Thus, (i) is the preferred solution.
It was really bad that CONFIG_BLK_STATS went into 2.4.20,
but you need not use it.

Two months ago I sent the below Doc patch. It is still needed.
