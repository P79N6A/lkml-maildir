Not to mention, well, *proprietary*.  Consider this: with Linux
swraid, you don't have to worry about your manufacturer discontinuing
your product or going out of business; as long as you can connect your
disks to a CPU using any kind of controller you can recover your
data.  If a proprietary RAID controller croaks, and you can't get
another one of the same brand/model, you might have no more data...
