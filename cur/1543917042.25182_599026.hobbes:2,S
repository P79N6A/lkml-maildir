You're mistaken.  Or more properly, further use of chroot lets you walk 
out.  This really has been said before, and before, and before.
    chroot("subtree");   // enter chroot
    chdir("/");    // now at subtree
    chroot("/tmp");   // now outside of chroot
BSD redefined chroot so that the working directory is set to the new 
root on subsequent uses of chroot; that's how they solved the bug.
