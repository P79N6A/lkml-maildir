	But as russian proverb says, trouble never comes alone. :-) NVIDIA's fresh driver
isn't compatible anymore:
	1) To have compiled it I had to replace global_flush_tlb() call with
__flush_tlb_all() and still guessing was it(?) a correct replacment at all :-)
	2) When loading it emits such messages:
		nvidia: Unknown symbol change_page_attr
		nvidia: Unknown symbol init_mm
	Can it be quick and easy solved?
