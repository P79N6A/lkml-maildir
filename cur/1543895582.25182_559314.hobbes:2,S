If you were right and it turned out that way, the whole GPL would
become so ridiculous that it won't have any of its intended effects.
GPLv17 would contain so many #ifdefs that it'll simply not be readable

As far as the kernel is concerned, I expect the game's played by
simply keeping GPLv2. And I like it that way.
