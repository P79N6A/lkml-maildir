In __ioremap() I added this under if(!PageReserved(page)) {...}:
		if (phys_addr == 0x40e) {
			printk("PAGE %p (pfn=%ld): flags=%lx, count=%d\n",
			       page,
			       page_to_pfn(page),
			       page->flags,
			       atomic_read(&page->_count));
		}
And I get:
[ 1013.864201] PAGE ffff810001000000 (pfn=0): flags=0, count=0
So at least no one is using that page. Still it is not clear why it
doesn't have the reserve flag turned on.
