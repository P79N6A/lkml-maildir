Hi, Andi!

How is this different from what we have for compat_sys_ioctl
in 2.6.10? Or is this an old bug?

Cant we just add them to fs/compat_ioctl.c instead, and be done?

We still need the conversion functions in fs/compat_ioctl.c, I
think. If that is true, for some devices the handler only almost works
if it returns -EINVAL, and maybe its best not to encourage this.
I have another idea: maybe, lets move the unlocked_ioctl handler up so
that it, too, is required to return -NOIOCTLCMD?
I would argue it also may improve ioctl performance by a small margin,
since it is the unlocked_ioctl/compat_ioctl that do the "real" work.
I plan to send, separately, a patch that does this.
Please comment.

Its an old issue, isnt it? And probably better split in a separate
patch?

It seems it is still missing for compat_ioctl. No?
I am sending a patch to fix this separately.
