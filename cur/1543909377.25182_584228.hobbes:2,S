The driver logs that information as it starts; on this sytem:
 ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.2: USB 2.0 started, EHCI 1.00, driver 10 Dec 2004
vs "EHCI 0.95".

Theoretically possible, and I've certainly seen hardware made to do
stranger things than that.

A NEC 0.95 ??  Should be fine with Linux.  Assuming no bugs have
crept in.
