As far as i understand mmap/send, you'll have a copy operation in the
kernel here. mmap shares the kernel and user buffer, but when sending the
packet data is copied to the socket buffer!!??
OK, but I understand that my streaming scenario is not the target
application for sendfile.
Then, I have another question - so that I maybe can implement this myself.
Can the network interface support gather operations - ie. collecting data
several places for a packet ("DMA gather copy" from memory to NIC)?
(Like described in

If so, does the sk_buff use the struct skb_shared_info to point to the
different memory regions, or ...?
