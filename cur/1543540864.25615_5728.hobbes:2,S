Look harder.  It also moves the "detect a break" logic before
			*status &= info->read_status_mask;
Apparently with the getty quintela uses, BRKINT isn't enabled, so SysRq
"doesn't work" for him.  I'm not sure it's a good idea to depend on
userspace enabling BRKINT - in test6-pre5, sysrq_enabled affects serial
SysRq as well.
