Yup.  It seems that your BIOS is being asked to suspend all devices
while there is still disk IO being performed.  And it refuses to
suspend because the disk is still active.
The patch I sent you attempts to put a one-seond delay in the
APM suspend function before calling into the BIOS.  That _should_
improve your suspend success rate, but there's really not much we
can do to prevent disk IO from being started at any time.
