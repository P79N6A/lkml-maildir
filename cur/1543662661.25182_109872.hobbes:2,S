What makes you think the licence is something like an _eternal_ NDA?
Larry, I've used bitkeeper for a few months to pull linus's and rik's trees 
and export them for my own use until about a month ago. I've also tried 
using it in a single user repository for contest (the benchmark).
Last week, feeling tempted to dig into arch, I removed all the files from 
the bitkeeper installation and I did a search-and-unlink of BitKeeper 
directories, just in case.
Do you intend to sue me if I ever submit a patch for cvs/subversion/whatever 
(arch kind of sucks:-) or if I feel like starting my own scm project? (while 
I think this would be ridiculous I'm not trying to bash you here, it's an 
honest question regarding Jamie's comment above)
