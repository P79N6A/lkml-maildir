This confusion, incidentally, is brought to you by the ambiguous use of 
the term "file descriptor."  In classic Unix, the "file descriptor" is the 
integer that open() returns.  It's an improper use of the term 
"descriptor," as this value does not describe but identifies.  But in the 
SCM_RIGHTS context, the term "file descriptor" is used to refer to a 
handle for a file image.  While it's true that a file descriptor goes in 
one end of the pipe and a (generally different) file descriptor comes out 
the other end, what's being passed is a handle for a file image (aka open 
instance).
