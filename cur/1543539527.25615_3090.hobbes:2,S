Jeeze.  That is what was TRIED at first.  It didn't seem to go
over too good.  When that happens, the party that finds the bug
usually gives up and says, fine have it your way, and posts.
Andre posted the problem with minimal detail (minimal
disclosure), and proposed solutions.  He was attacked left right
and center from all sides, from people that seemed to have strong
religious reasons or other CS reasons for not allowing it.  Many
of which have backed down now, or have ran out of arguments and
are now saying "oh, well I don't know the technical specs of IDE,
so I can't really speak for standards..."  They keep rehashing
the fact that root can destroy anything he likes anyways without
really considering that maybe root doesn't WANT to destroy it,
wether or not it is possible.  Few people are considering the
situation where there is NO root user - capabilities system.
These arguments always go like this:
1) Well, we will put code in the kernel to stop haxors from doing
   that.
2) Then joe hacker will write to /dev/mem
1) No, we'll disable /dev/mem
2) Then he'll do direct I/O
1) Then we'll disable direct I/O
2) Then he'll insmod a module that overrides it.
1) Then we'll disable module loading
2) Then he'll compile a new kernel, install it, relilo and reboot
1) No, we'll have disabled "root" and be using capabilities
2) He'll get in via social engineering the admin.
1) We'll kill the admin, burn all belongings, move his family out
   of the country. Then we'll burn the installed OS onto CDROM
   and run from a live filesystem with no random access storage.
2) He'll personally come there, and sneak in, removing the cd,
and activating the hard disk used to make the CDROM to begin
with, and THEN destroy it.
1) Nope, we'll put the computer in cement, inside a 2 foot thick
metal box buried 200 feet underground with 50 locks attached any
one of which explodes if tampered with.
2) He'll bring a diamond drill, and a payloader, and a bomb
squad, some welders...
1) My dad can beat up your dad.
2) No, my Uncle can beat up your dad.
1) My car engine displaces more water than yours.
2) My car costs more money than yours and is more efficient
1) My penis is bigger than yours
2) That's not what your mom tells me
1) Leave my mom out of this and I'll leave this out of your mom.
2) You are an arsehole..
ad infinitum...
After about round 2, the rest is pointless pissing match ending
up in no solution and possibly hurt feelings.
>And this form follows.  There is nothing at all wrong with the courtesy of

In this case, Andre *DID* offer the info without giving details,
and since he is IDE maintainer, effectively he amounts to the
vendor because it was him fixing it.  The fix wasn't
accepted.  Equivalent to "we don't want to hear about it, and
wont do anything about it, go away".  To which he said I QUIT,
here is the exploit, and here is another.
After that, the problem is OUT, and NOW we are seeing people
STILL CLAIMING their claims that it is useless, but with a
twist.  Now they're saying it is useless, but since it does this
and that it is probably a good idea, so I'd like to see it in the
kernel too, so please put it in Andre, even though it is useless
and someone can still get in root and do it anyway, and my Dad
_can_ really beat up your dad.
When a vendor doesn't respond - they leave no alternative but
silence or disclosure.  Disclosure is the proper way IMHO.

The buck starts here, not with distributions.  Fix the kernel,
then notify the distributions, and that way a patch exists.
THEN wait the grace period, and publically give the details.

Which was done by Andre, and met by vigorous opposition.  Such
opposition that it was the sole reason for the rapid public full
disclosure in the first place.  Piss off someone that knows about
an exploit and is trying to help fix it, and risk full immediate
disclosure.  That is the way it goes.

Certainly.  I agree 100%.

Yep.

So you follow my logic as well.  Then you likely also understand
that when the vendor (developers) do not respond, or respond
hostile, then that can end up speeding up disclosure
significantly - for spite, revenge, or merely to prove a point.
>Do you take pleasure in admins being ahead of the packet kiddie
>or the packet kiddie ahead of the admin?
Neither.  You NEVER know what joe hacker allready knows, and has
been using all along.

Unlikely.  I hope *your* system is NOT harmed.  I hope NOBODY has
any harm from this.

No, I agree with that fully.

Well, the first three are ok, but the latter I disagree
with.  Once an exploit is known, then it will have a script from
SOMEWHERE anyways.  If one comes with the script, then it is more
likely to be taken seriously, even if someone does not grok the
exploit explanation.
Really, its the whole "don't post virus source code" thing..  
FULL disclosure is the ONLY way to be secure.

This really is difficult to prove statistically, and can best
only be guessed.  Both sides of the argument that is.
>A code fragment that clearly illustrates the bug is sufficient
>for completely full disclosure.
To illustrate a problem, yes.  To make it completely
demonstrable, one needs code or must work their own out.  It is
really a choice of the person who discovered it - there is no
right or wrong way.
>A fully operable shell script that compiles an embedded program

You assume only script kiddies use the stuff.  *I* download
exploits often to test on my OWN stuff to see if I truely am at
risk.  Knowing only what it is, or does, without code, one may
not have the technical skill to whip up code to test out the
systems that potentially need testing for a particular exploit.
Also, analyzing a particular exploit may show up another possible
one that may have been missed.
Sorry, I'm in the *FULL* disclosure camp, and that includes
source too.  That is just preference though.
