1) Well, you've provided nobody with any information whatsoever
   that could even begin to allow them to attempt to help you.
2) You are assuming that it is in fact not a hardware failure,
   but actually a 2.2.x bug, without actually doing anything to
   really prove it.
3) You have not mentioned replacing Linux on THAT SPECIFIC
   MACHINE with FreeBSD, *OR* Linux.  Have you, and did they
   function superior?
If NT and BSD are working so excellently to you, why do you
bother with Linux considering your preconcieved notions and
assumptions?
If you have a problem, provide the details, and watch the
solution present itself.
If not, then use NT/BSD whatever... nobody will mind a bit.
Linux moves on, and we're all happier for it regardless of what
anyone else experiences - and wether it is just bias, or actual
legitimate problems with the Linux kernel, or a particular
distribution itself.
Just my $0.02.
