Perhaps I misunderstand, but Smack labels don't represent users (i.e.
user identity) in any way, so it seemed like a mismatch to use the _USER
flag there.  Whereas types in SELinux bear some similarity to Smack
labels - simple unstructured names whose meaning is only defined by the
policy rules.
Regardless, it seems like the audit maintainers ought to weigh in on the
matter.
