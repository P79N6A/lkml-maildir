  Hi, all. Version 99.5 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
NOTE: the devfs-patch-v99.x patches are backports to 2.2.x kernels of
the latest devfs-patches (which are for 2.3.x kernels).
This is against 2.2.12. Highlights of this release:
- Ported devfs-patch-v99.4 to kernel 2.2.12
  Thanks to Christian Czezatke <czezatke@xss.co.at>
				Regards,
					Richard....
