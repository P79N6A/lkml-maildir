Is this the same bug that would have caused SCSI timeouts/retries on an
Adaptec 2940 UW with a stock 2.4.3 kernel (Mandrake 8.0/Redhat 7.1)?
I've been trying to install Mandrake 8.0 from a  CD to a HD both
attached to a 2940 UW (Intel 440 FX motherboard), and the install took
hours of mostly zero CD/HD activity time, although it eventually
completed (the install fails to boot, though).
This has been reported to both Mandrake and Redhat:
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29555
I've been trying to find out if there's a fix (if it's aic7xxx 6.1.13
that's great!), but Redhat seem to believe it's a 2.4 kernel PCI bug:
