Touche!
Let's try this then:
Ext3 guarantees that its metadata will be comitted sufficiently 
atomically that after a crash it will be consistent with itself.
In data=journal and data=ordered modes ext3 also guarantees that the metadata will be committed atomically with the data they point to.  However ext3 does not provide user data atomicity guarantees beyond the scope of a single filesystem disk block (usually 4 kilobytes).  If a single write() spans two disk blocks it is possible that a crash partway through the write will result in only one of those blocks appearing in the file after recovery.
