Does that mean that mouse can not talk while we are sending commands
to it? That would help a bit.
Anyway, locking still seems to be needed: 
        while (psmouse->cmdcnt && timeout--) {
                if (psmouse->cmdcnt == 1 && command == PSMOUSE_CMD_RESET_BAT &&
                                timeout > 100000) /* do not run in a endless loop */
                        timeout = 100000; /* 1 sec */
                if (psmouse->cmdcnt == 1 && command == PSMOUSE_CMD_GETID &&
                    psmouse->cmdbuf[1] != 0xab && psmouse->cmdbuf[1] != 0xac) {
                        psmouse->cmdcnt = 0;
                        break;
                }
                spin_unlock_irq(&psmouse_lock);
                udelay(1);
                spin_lock_irq(&psmouse_lock);
        }
racing with
        if (psmouse->cmdcnt) {
                psmouse->cmdbuf[--psmouse->cmdcnt] = data;
                goto out;
        }
now... if each runs on different CPU, it can be possible that
psmouse->cmdcnt is seen as 1 but data are not yet in
psmouse->cmdbuf... Locking seems neccessary here.
