Yes that's a new feature.  Until we switch over to the "real"
console we print the log messages using the firmware console
routines.
This way if an early crash or similar happens, you'll see it
and be able to report it instead of having to report with
"-p" on the command line.
I'll fire up my ultra5 and try to figure out what's wrong
with the atyfb framebuffer driver, that's where it's dying.
