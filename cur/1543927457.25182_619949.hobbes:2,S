btw., in case you feel inclined, i recently did some userspace coding 
and found to my surprise that /proc/self points to the parent task, not 
the thread itself (giving threads no real way to examine themselves). If 
you are hacking in this area, would it be a big trouble to add something 
like /proc/self-task/ or something like that? I had to use a raw gettid 
syscall to figure out the TID to get to /proc/*/tasks/TID/sched 
instrumentation info - which is quite a PITA.
