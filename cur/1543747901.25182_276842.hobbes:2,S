Hi Bart.
I see your 2004-11-01 IDE update:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/1/158
obsoleted the idex=ata66 option, saying that it "should be handled by 
host drivers needing it". As far as I can see, amd74xx does not handle this?
I do need a way to force an 80c cable on this AMD756 (ATA66 max) board, 
since the BIOS doesn't seem to be setting the cable bits correctly.
Regards,
Rene.
