This sort-of-randconfig is still for Unisys ES7000 sub-architecture,
so tweaking it to Thinkpad T41 doesn't get you much of anything that
is useful.  I think you can drop that step.
If you tweak it like this:
115c115
< # CONFIG_X86_PC is not set
---
> CONFIG_X86_PC=y
123c123
< CONFIG_X86_ES7000=y
---
> # CONFIG_X86_ES7000 is not set
and run 'make oldconfig', it will build.
I don't find this particular randconfig (#294) interesting, but
sometimes they can be, so don't stop trying them, please.
