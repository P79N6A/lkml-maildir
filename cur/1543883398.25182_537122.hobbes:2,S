It has to be able to suck in reports from people who don't know much
about how the Linux guys handle bugs, and has to keep the reporters
involved up until a bug can be closed.  IOW it has to be compatible with
integrators, developers, and reporters/testers.  Luckily though, not all
of them need all of that system's features.  ('system' == the right
people with the right tools)
