The new flock64 structure is defined per-architecture. 64bit systems
doesn't need flock64 (even the ones that supports 32bit legacy userspace)
so the flock64 structure should never suffer from the above issue.
The not explicit padding you point out above is just happening all the
time in the 64bit platforms with the default `struct flock`.
