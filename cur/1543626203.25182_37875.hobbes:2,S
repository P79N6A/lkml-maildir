Gimme a break, Manfred.  The patch fixes the new bug. Which was
hardly obvious.  The longstanding (as in years-old) bug was
pointed out to the maintainer.  
It may not even be a bug.  Certainly I don't think it's
worth my time to fiddle with it.  But you're at liberty to.

The kernel calls request_irq() inside cli() in lots of places.
That's the same bug: "if you called cli(), how come you're
allowing kmalloc to clear it?".
In 2.4, this is a design wart.  In 2.5, it will go BUG() if
the page allocator performs I/O.
