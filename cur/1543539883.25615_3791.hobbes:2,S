I have a reproducable way of locking up my whole machine: run less, go to
the end of the file and keep the up arrow pressed down. This will eventual-
ly lock up the whole machine. I allready mailed the writer of less, but I
think it is a kernel problem. (It only happens when scroling up, not when
scrolling down. Also repeatidly pressing up causes no problem, just holding
it down)
I forgot my .config at home, but it hapens with stock redhat 6.2 kernel,
(2.2.14), with 2.2.14 without patches, and with 2.2.16 without patches. I
think 2.2.10 was stable (without PCI built in), but I didn't stress-test
it yet.
Configuration is a pentium 166 with PCI, video-card is an S3 Trio 64 V+
(PCI). The box gets totally locked up, no alt-sysrq, no console switching.
The only way to get out is hitting the reset button.
This doesn't happen on my 486 running 2.2.10.
I suspect it is a timing problem of some kind, but I'm not certain.
For more information, mail me in private, since I'm not on the list (tempo-
rarily redirecting all kernel-traffic to /dev/null due to holidays, quota
and no internet access at home).
