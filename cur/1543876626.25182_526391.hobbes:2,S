We do want to make sure that there isn't anyone relying on these.  Are
you thinking of simple sparsemem vs. extreme vs. sparsemem vmemmap?  Or,
are you thinking of sparsemem vs. discontig?

Amen, brother.  I'd love to see DISCONTIG die, with sufficient testing,
of course.  Andi, do you have any ideas on how to get sparsemem out of
the 'experimental' phase?
I have noticed before that sparsemem should be able to cover the flatmem
case if we make MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS == SECTION_SIZE_BITS and massage from
there.
