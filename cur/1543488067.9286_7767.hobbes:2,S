   there is one more place i found that does sleep_on() with cli(),
   this can lead to lockups under SMP. Are there any unsolved reports
   of lockups for NFS + SMP-2.2.2?
That whole stretch of code is bogus, it should be using bh atomicity
instead.  The thing it is trying to be atomic against are events which
are a result of packet arrival and perhaps timers as well.
