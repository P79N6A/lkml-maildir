Subject: Unnecessary zero initializers bloating .data

I think there are some unnecessary (and not benign) initializers here and
there in the kernel.
I will pick on ll_rw_blk.c first as it seems to be a good example.  Consider
the arrays defined at the top of the file.
Why explicitly initialize those arrays with 0?  It forces them into .data,
bloating .data unnecessarily.  That may be no big deal for desktops, but for
embedded it is.  Removing the initializers shifts them to .bss where they
take up no room in the on-disk kernel image.
I see no reason to use those zero initializers.  The kernel appears to
initialize .bss to zero in head.S. for almost every architecture (i386, arm,
mips, ppc, sh, sparc - don't know what is up with alpha), so it seems safe
to assume that uninitialized data is 0.
Also, ISO C9X draft says:
----------
6.7.8.10 If an object that has automatic storage duration is not initialized
explicitly, its value is indeterminate. If an object that has static storage
duration is not initialized explicitly, then:
- if it has pointer type, it is initialized to a null pointer;
- if it has arithmetic type, it is initialized to (positive or unsigned)
zero;
- if it is an aggregate, every member is initialized (recursively) according
to these rules;
- if it is a union, the first named member is initialized (recursively)
according to these rules.
----------
This simple patch alone cuts the on-disk size of the kernel by over 8k, and
it looks like it is just the beginning of removing bloat from .data:
