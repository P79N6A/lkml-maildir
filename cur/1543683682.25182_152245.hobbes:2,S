This must be the reason behind a simple "Save..." of a little OpenOffice
Writer document taking 3 seconds with no activity on the box, and two
minutes when "make bzImage", or "yes" or anyhting CPU intensive.
On the other hand, OO saves files (which is a CPU-bound process) only
marginally slower under heavy hard disk read activity than on an idle
system. Tested with 2.6.0-test2 and with 2.6.0-test2 with latest
scheduler patch from Ingo (2.6.0-test1-G6).
