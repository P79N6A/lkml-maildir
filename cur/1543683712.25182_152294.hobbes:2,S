If you compile 2.6.0-test2 with HISAX_SEDLBAUER_CS and !HISAX_SEDLBAUER 
the final linking fails with the followingg error:
<--  snip  -->
...
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
...
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x8f0b3f): In function `sedlbauer_config':
: undefined reference to `sedl_init_pcmcia'
...
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
There might be better solutions, but the following patch at least
revents this problem:
