I have a problem with the buffering mechanism of my blockdevice,
namely a ide_scsi DVD-ROM drive. After inserting a DVD and reading
data linearly from the DVD, an excessive amount of buffer memory gets
allocated.
This can easily be reproduced with
	cat /dev/sr0 > /dev/null
Remember, nearly the same task is carried out when playing a DVD.
As a result the system performance goes down. I'm still able to use
my applications, but es every single piece of unused memory is swapped
out, and swapping in costs a certain amount of time.
So, what wents wrong? I tried to find some information on this with
google and geocrawler, but i didn't have a success :(
Kernel: linux-2.4.4
hoping for some tips ...
