	RTFM. man inetd and there you go. kill -1 <pid_of_inetd> makes it
reread the /etc/inetd.conf. Yes, on all Unices. inetd rereads the
configuration when it gets a SIGHUP. Pretty standard convention for
daemons. Ferchrissake, it's plainly written in inetd manpage on every
system I ever dealt with. From Solaris one:
     New services can be activated, and existing services deleted
     or  modified by editing the configuration file, then sending
     inetd a  SIGHUP signal.
	Furrfu... Indeed, killing the thing when it has active children 
(in.telnetd, for one) is going to orphan them. Why doing that? There is
clearly documented way to change the configuration. Trust man(1), man is
your friend...
