and this patches both have a bug that effectively disables all highmem (if present)
when badram patch is activated. I contacted Rick, but never got any answer back.
(in fact I got an auto reply from some Debian bugtracking system, but that's about it).
Corrected 2.4.21 version of the patch is available at
http://linuxhacker.ru/patches/2.4.21-badram.diff
The arch/i386/mm/init.c part:

should obviously get "#else" replaced with "#endif" and original "#endif" should be removed
because otherwise all of the highmem pages are either bad or used right from the initialisation.
(Yes, I have highmem (2G RAM) system with 2 bits bad and I am too lazy to to go to the store to
replace the RAM modules, so I given a patch a try and discovered this problem (which is there
for a long time it seems). I suspect that I am the only one who runs this patch on highmem system,
though ;) )
