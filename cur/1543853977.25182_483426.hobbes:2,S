The fact that the dock starts to beep annoyingly. It has a button that
you should press before undocking, and wait for a green light to light
up before removing the laptop.  If you remove the computer without
doing so, the dock starts beeping, and it doesn't stop (AFAIK, haven't
managed to stand the beeping for more than 30 seconds or so) until you
replug the laptop.
My guess is that there is some wait to trigger an undock event from
software as well, and that it would be nice to send that signal to the
dock before suspending...
