Hi,
I have an old webcam, a Compro PS39U. By windows it's recognized as
vicam and works with the vicam driver. With Linux it didn't work.
lsusb showed that it identifies different than camera's recognized by
the vicam driver. So I added the usb id to vicam.c, and it now
produces images through the driver under Linux too. It's still a
shitty camera though.
I'm submitting the change, maybe someone else has this camera and
want's to use it.
Regards,
Bas
