if you look at the Bluetooth subsystem, it became real devices in the
2.6.18 release. I was using a platform device for the virtual and UART
based adapters with no parent, but I am gonna change this to the virtual
devices once it is upstream. It works beautiful and the /sys/class is
now only a fast entry point to find the devices.
Regards
Marcel
