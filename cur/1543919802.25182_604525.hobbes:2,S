The "--follow" flag will follow renames when doing a log, so a simple
	git log --follow arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c
will do it.
[ Although I actually introduced a bug in that last week, so if it gives 
  empty output for you, add a "--stat" to get a diffstat (or "-p" to get 
  the whole patch) to work around a stupid mistake. That bug is in both 
  1.5.3.3 and 1.5.3.4 - and Junio happens to be away for two weeks, so 
  it's not fixed in any release yet. I have a trivial patch for it if you 
  care, but the "use -p" workaround is usually what you want to do anyway, 
  which is probably why  nobody even noticed it was broken! ]
