I evaluated both v9fs and FUSE for my project (I don't want to link to it 
until it does something actually useful ;) ) ... and it seemed that v9fs 
just wasn't UNIXy enough for my purposes -- the Plan9 way and the UNIX way 
were different enough to make me nervous.  I don't remember the specific 
details (this was a few months ago), but I do remember that v9fs had no 
extended attribute support, which was a showstopper for me.  Also, I 
couldn't find any userspace library for writing 9P servers.
Others may have reached similar conclusions.  Or maybe FUSE is just 
better-marketed. ;)
Either way, I am a happy FUSE user.  I think it offers things v9fs doesn't, 
and I'd like to see it in mainline. :)
