Hello everyone:
I tried to compile 2.2.4 and the process went without a glitch. But
when  I looked into /arch/i386/boot directory I couldn't find bzImage! I
have no problems compiling kernel with Alan Cox's patch, but without it
simply fails. Can someone explain me if I am doing something wrong here?
Currently I have: RH5.2 glibc-2.1 linux-2.2.3-ac4.
Tried to install: linux-2.2.4 with patch-2.2.4
Thanks to all.
Alex
