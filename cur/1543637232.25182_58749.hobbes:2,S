I like this.  The only change I would make is to enable
interrupts in exit.c and entry.S where they are only enabled
under the debug condition now, (mostly I try to avoid
Heisenberg).  I really do like the ability to track down
this problem by just turing on the debug option.

Yeah, its easy when you know what to look for :)
