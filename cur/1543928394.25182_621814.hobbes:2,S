AFAIK that is obsolete anyways. It was done because it was feared it would
be broken, but at least the broken cases I knew about were all fixed
a long time ago. Most likely it could be safely removed.

Modules that cannot be unloaded are still useful. Standard case: Distributions
like to offer an option to not use ipv6 because that is popular workaround
for the common "DNS server eats AAAA queries and causes delays" issue.
Forcing the user to rebuild the kernel for this wouldn't be practical.
If ipv6 wasn't modular that would be hard to do.
