Yes, and that tagging worked just fine.  You can see this too if you
want to check out a tree based on a tag.

Uses git, which will have the same issues as you are facing :)
Please remeber, with a distributed development system like this, going
off of the "date" means _nothing_.  What matters is when that patch and
branch is merged into his tree, and to determine that, you will have to
dig around a bit.
And since you have raw patches, and know what you are looking for, the
solution should be very simple (hint, grep...)
Good luck,
