You sure this is correct? If i compile both the zr36120 and the zoran driver 
i seem to get more than one i2c-old... Same goes for the saa7110
etc etc
The L_I2C/M_I2C trick (same for TUNER and DECODER) was created for
just making sure if either one of those drivers needed it in-kernel,
i2c-old went into the kernel too, and otherwise went in as a modules.
