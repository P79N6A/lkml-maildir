disabling udma is a REALLY bad idea if you're talking about udma33
and your drive and controller both support it.  why?  because udma
is telling you that your cable is too long or broken; disabling udma
means not using CRC's on each transfer, making the corruption invisible.
remember, IDE cables must be 18" or less, and you must have both ends
plugged in (no stub).
the real issue seems to be drives that power up in udma66 by default;
this doesn't work on most hardware, and at least some versions of Linux
aren't smart enough to tune to a supported mode.  besides, no current disk is
too fast for udma33.
