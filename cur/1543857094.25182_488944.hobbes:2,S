As there are many options being discussed here, let me propose one 
more option that can eliminate the need for hotplug lock in 
cpufreq_driver_target() path.
As Gautham clearly explained before, today we have cpufreq calling
cpufreq_driver_target() in each driver to change the CPU frequency
And the driver internally uses set_cpus_allowed to reschedule onto
different affected_cpus and change the frequency. That is the main
reason why we need to disable hotplug in this path.
But, if we make cpufreq more affected_cpus aware and have a per_cpu
target()
call by moving set_cpus_allowed() from driver into cpufreq core and
define
the target function to be atomic/non-sleeping type, then we really don't
need a hotplug lock for the driver any more. Driver can have
get_cpu/put_cpu
pair to disable preemption and then change the frequency.
This means a lot of changes as we need new interface changes to cpufreq
and
rewrite of bunch of drivers. But, this looks to me as the least
complicated solution.
Thanks,
Venki
