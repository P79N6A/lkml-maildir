We have done nothing, and there are no plans to implement any workaround
for this problem.
RFC2385 MD5 hashing support is going in soon, and for the application where
the vulnerability actually matters (BGP sessions between backbone routers)
MD5 clears that problem right up and they're all using MD5 protection already
anyways.
