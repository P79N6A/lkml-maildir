One possible course of action to implement this without eating extra
space in the rb_node would be:
- Add rb_right() and rb_set_right() (plus ditto _left variants) to
  rbtree.h
- Convert all in-kernel users to use these. Quite extensive, as the
  rbtree code search/insert functions are coded in situ and not in
  rbtree.[ch]
- Now we can overload bit 0 of ->rb_right and ->rb_left to indicate
  whether this is a node or thread pointer and modify rbtree.c to tag
  and add the thread links when appropriate.
So we can definitely do this in a compatible fashion. Given that I have
a flight coming up in a few days time, I may give it a got if no one
beats me to it :-)
