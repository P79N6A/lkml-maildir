I don't know if they 'screwed it up'.  There are devices that misbehave
when registers are read from pci config space.  But this was never
guaranteed to be a safe thing to do; it gradualy became clear that
people expected to be able to read random registers and manufacturers
responded accordingly, but I don't think you were ever guaranteed to be
able to peek at bits of config space arbitrarily.
