Yes.
Untill pool is filled and then sleep there.
When someone wants to draw from the pool - awake and fill it again.
I clearly see your point here and I agree that it must be
default method for entropy producing, but if there are 
possibility to speed that up, such techniques should be 
allowed to be used.
It is really faster to fill pool from the kernelspace
without copying/validating it in userspace.
