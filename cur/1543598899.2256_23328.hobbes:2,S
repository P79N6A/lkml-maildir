What about this then:
#define min(x,y) ({typeof(x) __x=(x); typeof(y) __y=(y); (__x < __y) ?
__x : __y})
This is guaranteed to work the same as the old min/max in all cases but
without side effects. You can still force the comparison to be done with
a certain type by casting the arguments first:
#define typed_min(type, x, y) (min((type)(x), (type)(y)))
...although, if the type used for the comparison is so critical you
maybe shouldn't be hiding it in a macro anyway.
