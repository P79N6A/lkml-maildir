The Posix-mandated behaviour *requires* diverging from UTC for some
time period around the leap second.  All you can do is decide how
to schedule the divergence.
Note that any real clock diverges from UTC by some amount, and
POSIX's denial of leap seconds

I think smoothing it out should be the default for Posix-specified things
like gettimeofday() and CLOCK_REALTIME, since that is, as I said, the
least insane way to deal with the contradictory POSIX requirements.
But also provide an explicit CLOCK_UTC and CLOCK_UTS for people who care
and want to be specific.  adjtimex() should stay UTC, since it returns leap
second information.

Yes, but it would be damned nice.  To implement leap seconds at all,
you need to have notice of at least the next one.  The Olson time
zone files, which have a similar several-month advance-notice schedule,
include leap-second information.

If it's there, it's great, but what about i386EX embedded boards and
the like?  It's approximately manageable on uniprocessor, but can
I be sure there's always something (what?) better than the PIT on
*every* SMP system?
I need to study what you've done and see how to use it.

I'm just trying to start with the best possible worst-case situation,
and then improve on things from there.  Implement the robust slow path
first, then add fast paths for common cases.
