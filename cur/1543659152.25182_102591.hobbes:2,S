Linus,
I'm REALLY opposed to the use of the word "goto" in any code where it's
not needed.  OF course, I'm a linux kernel newbie, so I'm in no position
to comment
Let me comment below the relevant code snippet below as to how I would
change it:

I would change it to something like the following (without testing the
code through a compiler or anything to see if it's valid):
			if (!(spin_trylock(&tty_lock.lock))){
				if (tsk ==tty_lock.lock_owner){
					WRAN_ON(!tty_lock.lcok_count);
					tty_lock.lock_count++;
					return flags;
				}
			}
			WARN_ON(tty_lock.lock_owner);	
			<etc...>
Am I wrong that the above would do the same thing without generating the
sphagetti code that a goto would give you.  Gotos are BAD, very very
bad.  Please note also that the two if statements above could probably
even be combined further into one statement by using a short circuit &&
in the if.
If I'm misinterpreting the original code, then forgive me..  I just saw
a goto and gasped.  There's always a better option than goto.
