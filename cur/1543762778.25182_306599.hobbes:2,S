Subject: [PATCH] fix shared key auth in zd1201

Hi,
this is a resend of a patch that Andrew put in -mm, but that I think is
ok and should go into mainline. I did not get any feedback (positive or
negative) about it. Please either apply it or explain why not...
It's currently impossible to associate with a shared-key-only access
point using the zd1201 driver. The attached patch fixes it. The reason
was (probably) a typo in the definitions of the authentification types.
I found that they should be (1,2) instead of (0,1) by looking at the
old linux-wlan-ng driver by Zydas.
