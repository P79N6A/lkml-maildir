	I don't see why you think it's too late. It needs to be initialized
before it's used. Waiting until notify_per_task_watchers() is called
with WATCH_TASK_INIT does this.

	That would work. It would not simplify the control flow of the code.
The branch for WATCH_TASK_INIT in notify_per_task_watchers() is
unavoidable; we need to call the parent task's chain in that case since
we know the child task's is empty.
	It is also counter to one goal of the patches -- reducing the "clutter"
in these paths. Arguably task watchers is the same kind of clutter that
existed before. However, it is a means of factoring such clutter into
fewer instances (ideally one) of the pattern.
