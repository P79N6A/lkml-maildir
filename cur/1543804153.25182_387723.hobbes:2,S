Which is worse: overhead due to cache misses or an oops caused by code 
being called after it was unloaded?
Do you have a better proposal for a way to prevent blocking notifier 
chains from being modified while in use?  Or would you prefer to rewrite 
all the callout routines that currently block, so that all the notifier 
chains can be made atomic and we don't need the blocking notifier API?
