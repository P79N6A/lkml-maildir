Speaking as an "ordinary" end user (there's nothing ordinary about me) I think 
the idea of even/odd releases is silly.  This accomplishes the same goals, 
and is less confusing all told.
Linus's plan will work well for about...  two releases, then people will wise 
up and stop testing the odd releases.  I know that's what I'll probably end 
up doing.
