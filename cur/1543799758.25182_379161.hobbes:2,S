Are you sure it's ok to setup the tx descriptors in that order?
Usually, you need to set them up last to first so that the chip
doesn't see a half-filled-in set of TX descriptors.  Ie. the
core question is if the chip can scan the TX descriptors looking
for valid ones all on it's own after processing existing TX
descriptors, or do you have to explicitly allow the chip look
at the newly added TX descriptor with a register write or similar?
