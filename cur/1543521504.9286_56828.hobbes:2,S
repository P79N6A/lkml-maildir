     Had another crash of SS-10 w quad RTK-625 CPU's and 384MB of RAM
running Apache 1.3.3p3 under Sparc-32 linux 2.2.14 SMP.

     There are some things in common with the last crash, CPU 0 was stuck
at f00c3f10 in both crashes.  CPUs 1, 2, and 3, stuck at f002e3d8 in both
crashes.
     Configuration is same as last two crashes I posted.  The above
sequence of messages just prints over and over again about once a second. 
     In addition to the crashes being less frequent than under 2.2.13, the
pattern is also different.  Under 2.2.13, most of the time all of the
CPU's would be hung on spin_lock() mesages and spin_lock_irqsave() would
show up relatively in infrequently.  Now one CPU always hung on
spin_lock_irqsave with the other three on spin_lock.
