The Kconfig for this reads..
+config FEC_MPC52xx_MDIO
+       bool "MPC52xx FEC MDIO bus driver"
+       depends on FEC_MPC52xx
+       default y
+       ---help---
+         The MPC5200's FEC can connect to the Ethernet either with
+         an external MII PHY chip or 10 Mbps 7-wire interface
+         (Motorola? industry standard).
+         If your board uses an external PHY connected to FEC, enable this.
+         If not sure, enable.
+         If compiled as module, it will be called 'fec_mpc52xx_phy.ko'.
Because this is bool, it'll never be compiled as a module.
Given that fec_mpc52xx_phy.c has a MODULE_LICENSE()
Should this be a tristate perhaps ?
