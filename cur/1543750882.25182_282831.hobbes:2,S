for 2.6.11 we have dozens of scheduler patches queued in -mm that do
half of the work necessary for the rest of -RT. I'll split out more
stuff from -RT once the scheduler queue in -mm gets smaller (i.e. once
it gets merged upstream), but there's a natural limit to the rate of
merging in a given subsystem, if we push things too hard it will
deteriorate.
also, there's the necessary merging of preempt-bkl patch. It makes
little sense to add the more advanced stuff when the BKL is allowed to
generate up to ~200 milliseconds latencies. Hardirq and softirq
threading would be the next step after that point.
