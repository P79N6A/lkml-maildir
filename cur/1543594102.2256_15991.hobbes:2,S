Thanks for the quick response!
I tried most of the netstat options and was unable to see the buffer size.
I do see the Recv-Q and the Send-Q which are usually zero except when the
client stops ack-ing and then the server's Send-Q starts filling up.

On the client:
/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default = 65535
/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max = 65535
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem = 48128	48640	49152
On the server:
/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default = 65535
/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max = 65535
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem = 23552	24064	24576
The "bad" packet that seems to cause all the problems is only 1448
bytes long so I don't think insufficient buffers is the problem.
After the client stops ack-ing I can watch the server's Send-Q slowly
rise 2K, 4K, 6K, but it never comes close to these buffer limits.
Robert.
