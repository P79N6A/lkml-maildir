Hi,
First at all thx for your work!
I have a laptop with linux (debian sid) and the kernel 2.6.18.1. The 
multimadia hotkeys seem to work with a driver / module "acerhk" ( 
http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~tauber/acerhk/
 ). On 
http://www.linux-laptop.net/
 there are lots of computers which are using 
it.
Is it planned to integrate it in the kernel ?
Thx for your attention and sorry for my bad english...(my accent is worse)
Guillaume
