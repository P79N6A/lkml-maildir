Nothing registered on the acpi interrupt in /proc/interrupts?

Depends on the root cause -- try it.  If it works we can replace the current blacklist entry with one keyed off the BIOS date.
If you want Linux/ACPI to work on this board, or proof that the board can't possibly support it, then then file a bug:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/
Category: Power Management
Component: ACPI
Attach the console log and /proc/interrupts of the failure, dmidecode output, and acpidmp output.
> With acpi=ht it works for now, but doesn't acpi=ht imply pci=noacpi?
Booting with acpi=force should be the same as removing the P2B-DS from the dmi blacklist.
acpi=ht will use ACPI for enumerating processors, and then ACPI will exit.
ACPI will not be used to configure interrupts and the interpreter will not
run so you'll get no run-time events.  If this system doesn't have HT and has MPS, then ACPI with acpi=ht does nothing for you that you don't have already.
pci=noacpi is the same as above except the interpreter _will_ run in support of run-time events.
Ie. Acpi=ht will give you "ACPI: Interpreter disabled" and pci=noacpi will not.
