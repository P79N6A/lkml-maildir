|   An old thing from early annals of computer science (I browsed Knuth's
| "The Art" again..) is called   Coroutine.
|
| Gives you "one thread per connection" programming model, but without
| actual multiple scheduling threads in the kernel side.
|
| Simplest coroutine implementations are truly simple.. Pagefull of C.
| Knuth shows it with very few MIX (assembly) instructions.
|
| Throwing in non-blocking socket/filedescriptor access, and in event
| of "EAGAIN", coroutine-yielding to some other coroutine, does complicate
| things, naturally.
|
| Good coder finds balance in between various methods, possibly uses
| both coroutine "userspace threads", and actual kernel threads.
|
| Doing coroutine library all in portable C (by means of setjmp()/longjmp())
| is possible, but not very efficient.  A bit of assembly helps a lot.

Davide Libenzi (epoll) likes and discusses coroutines on one of his
web pages:

(search for /coroutine/)
