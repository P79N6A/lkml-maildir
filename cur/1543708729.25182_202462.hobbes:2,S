I will eyeball it...
Is it the kernel that is shutting down, or the kernel that is being
brought up that has problems?
The back trace from the BUG would be interesting.
As I see it flush_tlb_others is being called when we have shutdown
cpus and the kernel still thinks we have the mm present on foreign
cpus.
So it appears we simply have a case that was not anticipated
by the authors of that code.  So we need to adjust either
the code we are calling or cpu_vm_mask so it does not list
other cpus after we have shut them down.
At least that it what it looks like at first glance.
