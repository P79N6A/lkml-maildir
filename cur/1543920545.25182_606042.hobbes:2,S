Just to add to why sometimes vendors disable PCIe hotplug by not providing
_OSC - sometimes there are problems with the hardware itself, and so
due to schedule and other reasons, vendors will decide to just disable
the support by not providing OSC, since really according to spec we shouldn't
be running the PCIe hot plug driver if OSC doesn't exist or fails.  This
can be anything from "Well, we don't have time to test it" to actual hardware
errata.  At any rate, we don't know the reasons.  I think when we force these
things, you run the danger that things will break on you in some strange
ways.
Just out of curiosity, did you try using ACPI based hotplug for this 
laptop?  Sometimes vendors will let you do that because then they can include
hardware workarounds in the AML.
