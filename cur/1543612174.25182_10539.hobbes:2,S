Hello,
I would like to remove an executable from the file-system while it is 
running and
get all the blocks back immediately, not after the end of the program.
Is this possible ?
 From what I understand, the inode is not released until the program 
ends. Do all the
file-systems behave the same way ?
Thank you for your help.
