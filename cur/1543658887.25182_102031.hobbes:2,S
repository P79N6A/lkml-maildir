There is also a much older matter. In the distant past IBM used the
last cylinder for testing. That means that many FDISK versions and many
BIOSes subtract one from the number of available cylinders.
There are several ways to ask the BIOS for the size of a disk,
and some of these calls may invoke others, and then subtract one.
I have seen disks that had lost three cylinders that way.
