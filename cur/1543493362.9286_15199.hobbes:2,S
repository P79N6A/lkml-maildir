Dear Sirs, Madams,
Thank you very much for your very enthusiastic messages. I 
would like to apologize for this late of mine for I have 
been away for the past several days.
Here is a summary of the replies I have received:
George Bonser <grep@shorelink.com>, Timothy Writer 
<Tim.Writer@ftlsol.com>, Brent Verner <brent@linux1.org>, 
Aaron T Porter <atporter@entropy.muc.muohio.edu> and Rik van 
Riel <riel@nl.linux.org> all have offered to help. 
In fact, they have already started a discussion regarding 
ways to gather Tuning Tips for Linux, including 
	*	Making preliminary identification on fields
		that may need tuning the most (database,
		webserver),
	*	Suggesting the set up of a reference system,
		finding potential hosts to host the project, 
		(including comparing various potential
		host's bandwidth),
	*	Brainstorming on name(s) for the project,
	*	Reviving the linux-perf mailing list,
	*	Inviting heavyweights like Alan Cox,
		Mark Lord and many others to
		contribute the various ways
		to fine-tune Linux,
	*	PR campaign like making an announcement on
		slashdot.org, etc.
Mat Kovach <mkovach@cleveland.lug.net> has generously 
offered to start a mailing list on their newly acquired 
linuxgroups.org domain to discuss ways to optimize Linux and 
various related applications.
Peter Waltenberg <peterw@dascom.com>  has wrote in to 
suggest that a deamon "tuningd" be created to dynamically 
tweaks the system, while Horst von Brand 
<vonbrand@inf.utfsm.cl> thinks one or more HOWTO(s) may do 
the trick.
J.C. (John Clifford) Armbruster <jcarmbruster@earthlink.net> 
and Chuck Lever <cel@monkey.org> have also enthusiastically 
offering their help.
	[Note: If I inevitably have left out your name,
	please accept my apology.
	My linux-kernel feed has been cut-off by the
	majordomo again (apparently because of
	bounced mails), so I have no way to gauge
	exactly how many have responded.
	I include the email addresses of the persons
	who responded in hoping to foster a further
	discussion to work out the kinks and if
	possible, obtain a concensus of what should
	be done next.
	I am also making this reply available to the
	linux-kernel list for people who are interested
	to get contact with each others.]
This discussion of Fine-tuning Linux was brought about by, - 
and ironically thanks to, - Mindcraft's questionable 
"benchmark comparison" of NT vs Linux. 
For years we Linux users already know the fact, that Linux 
is not only more solid and robust than NT, Linux is _FASTER_ 
as well. 
	Not only faster, but many, many *TIMES* faster !!!
One thing that the Mindcraft's "report" has shown us, 
however, is that a TUNE-DOWN Linux machine can be *slower* 
than NT.
If Linux can be TUNE-DOWN to a crawl, as Mindcraft's case 
has shown, Linux can be TUNE-UP too !! The question is thus 
	How many of those tune-up tips and tricks are
	available to the average Joe Blow Linux-user?
Truth is, there are tons of tips and tricks to fine-tune 
Linux. But unfortunately, they are scattered everywhere. 
For the average Joe Blow Linux-user,  finding the correct 
find-tuning tips involve the task of searching high and low 
in the thousands of Linux-related websites, posting and 
re-posting their questions to various mailing lists, 
newsgroups, and to their friends. And since there are more 
and more applications being ported to Linux, and there are 
more and more peripherals that Linux recognizes, the chance 
for finding _really_ useful tips for the myriad combo of 
apps/peripherals/distros may be so minute that many Joe Blow 
Linux-users are running their Linux machines 
under-optimized.
IMHO, the biggest problem most Linux-users are facing, in 
term of getting the correct tune-up tips, is a logistical 
one --- on where and how to find those tips and tricks, and 
the people who offered them in the first place.
Only if there is an effort to gather all of the tips and 
gurus to one place, categorize all the information, and put 
it in an organized fashion for the world to use, and thanks 
to the people I mentioned above, something _is_ happening.
There are several different approaches being suggested 
(Howtos, deamons, OS-app tips, mailing-list and websites as 
clearinghouse for the info) and I think all of the 
approaches are valid in their own right, and they should be 
further exploited.
As I have said in my previous post, I am not an 
"expert"although I've been using Linux since the 0.9x.y 
time. I have my share of tip-search and code-tweaking, and 
still there is something that constantly bugs me --- that my 
Linux machines are not tapping their full potentials. Call 
me a performance freak if you like, but one thing that make 
me stick with Linux all the while was that Windoze 
(including NT) is way too buggy, too bloated, and too 
s-l-o-w.
I will do whatever I can to help out the effort in making 
the Fine-Tuning tips for Linux available to the world, I 
will even share my very limited knowledge if it helps, but I 
know there are others who are much, MUCH better than me out 
there. 
Since Mr. Porter may've found a host with T3 connection, and 
Messrs. Verner, Bonser, van Riel, Waltenberg, Lever, Writer, 
Armbruster, Kovach, von Brand and many others have offered 
enthusiastic ideas, helps and supports, I think my place in 
this endeavor - other than occassionally offer my limited 
understanding of Linux, - may be running a mirror site to 
the project dedicated to Fine-Tuning Linux. I hope in times 
the project will proof to be a boost to Linux Operating 
System, and help the Joe Blow Linux-users of the world in 
making their Linux machines fly as high as they should be.
Before I end this boring message of mine, I do have to 
mention the following:
	The Linux community is *truly* amazing.
	The absolutely positive responses I've received
	from so many enthusiastic people of the Linux
	community is a proof that we not only share a
	common vision, we work _HARD_ to make it 
	into a reality.
Again I wish to convey my most sincere heartfelt thanks to 
all of you.
Most respectfully,
Pete

PS. 	While I am using terms like "optimizing" and
	"fine-tuning", I have to thank the many,
	many dedicated people on the L-K list for
	their excellent success in fine-tuning the
	Linux Kernel, and to people from other
	OpenSource groups who have devoted
	countless precious hours in debugging
	and optimizing their respective OpenSource
	codes.
PPS.	A special mention (since Rik is involved in it)
	is the Stampede Linux. AFAIK, Stampede is an
	optimized-kernel distro for the X86 platform
	which reportedly is 5 - 30% faster
	(depend on who you talk to) than the
	garden-variety Linux. I believe Rik can fill you
	the rest of the Stampede stuff.
