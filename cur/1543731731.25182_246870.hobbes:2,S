Does the kernel scheduler notice when a CPU spends a lot of time doing 
interrupt processing?
For many network configurations you get the best cache affinity, etc. if 
you lock network interrupts to a single CPU.  However, on a box with 
high network load, that could mean that that CPU is spending more time 
processing interrupts than doing Real Work(tm).
Will the scheduler "notice" this, and increasingly schedule processes 
away from the interrupt-heavy CPU?
