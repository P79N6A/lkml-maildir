Those aren't real devices at all; they are merely entries in sysfs which
represent logical communication endpoints in the OHCI controller.  It's  
not meaningful to speak of suspending or resuming them, but the PM core 
tries to do anyway.  You can ignore those messages; they are harmless.

Turn on CONFIG_USB_DEBUG and then post the dmesg log showing what happens
when you plug in your USB stick.
