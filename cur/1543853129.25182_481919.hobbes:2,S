Honestly, I'm forced to go to this mentality more every day as well.  
The AT91RM9200 is available in at least two packages, not all of which 
have the same GPIO mapping (or even available lines!).  And don't get me 
started on PPC...

I think what Paul is saying here is that because your reference 
implementation was "arch-omap" instead of "board-<something>", if I add 
a PLD with some MMIO GPIO lines then I have to hack global OMAP code.  
Maybe we should codify an approach for that now, i.e. add to the 
reference implementation some code that hands off out-of-range GPIO 
lines to a function in the machine descriptor:
+static inline int gpio_direction_input(unsigned gpio)
+	{ if (gpio < OMAP_MAX_ARCH_GPIO) return __gpio_set_direction(gpio, 1);
+	  else if(mdesc->platform_gpio_set_direction) platform_gpio_set_direction(gpio, 1); }
... conveniently neglecting the way you find mdesc.  :)
I do have a question now.  Is there any reason to consider shared GPIO 
lines?  If so, then the request_gpio() would need a flag GPIO_SHARED or 
something.
