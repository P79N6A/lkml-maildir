It comes very close to applying to check_nmi_watchdog as both
of the functions called after endflag is set: printk and kfree 
both have nothing to do with the setting of endflag.   If they
were simpler functions an optimizing compiler could look at
them realizing that.  Since those two functions have nothing
to do with endflag someone else looking at the code remove or
reorder them with a trivial patch and the code could stop working.
GCC keeps getting more powerful optimizations so I am not comfortable
with depending on it simply eliminating dead-store-elimination when the
address of a variable has been taken.
If there is a better idiom to synchronize the cpus which does
not mark the variable volatile I could see switching to that. 
There is a theoretical race there as some cpu might not see endflag
get set and the next function on the stack could set it that same
stack slot to 0.  I can see value in fixing that, if there is a simple
and clear solution.  Currently I am having a failure of imagination.
