   while porting a serial multiport driver to sparc64 i disovered that the
   function get_tty_baud_rate() only returns 50 or 75 Baud
   for 57600 and 115200 which is *aehm* not what i expected.
   Is this something i made wrong when setting up something or
   is it another "Sparc[64] is different" issue ?
There is a bug in the Sparc headerfiles for the baud rate ioctls, the
kernel headers didn't match the userland headers under
/usr/include/bits.  Just fix the CBAUD etc. defines in
/usr/include/bits/termios.h to match the include/asm-sparc/termios.h
values and it should be fine.
