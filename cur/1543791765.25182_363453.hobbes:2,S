Things like make fork lots of short-lived child processes, and some of those 
can be quite memory intensive.  (The gcc 4.0.2 build causes an outright swap 
storm for me about halfway through, doing genattrtab and then again compiling 
the result).
Is there any way for parents to collect their child process's statistics when 
the children exit?  Or by the time the actual swapper exits, do we not care 
anymore?
