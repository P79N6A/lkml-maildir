Here's a newbie question about the merits of gettimeofday()
versus times() for implementing one's own little timers.
I'm writing a load generator to simulate thousands of dialup clients;
it throttles each client in userspace (rather than using a shaper device).
I'm currently using now = times(&dummy) to retrieve the current
tick count.  I do this very frequently to implement my own little
scheduler to simulate slow connections.  If I switch to using
sigtimedwait() and SIGIO to reduce the overhead of calling poll(),
my system call trace will look like this:
   for (;;) {
     sigtimedwait()
     now = times()
     if (this fd isn't still sleeping)
        read(this fd)
     while (after(some fd's wakeuptime, now))
        read(just woken up fd)
   }
So I'm affected by the overhead of times().
If gettimeofday() is going to be specially optimized, maybe
I should switch.
gettimeofday(&tv, 0) would work, but I'd have to munge the
fields of tv together to get a single integer, e.g.
  now = (tv.sec << 10) + (tv.usec >> 10)
Do the recent posts on special entry points mean that this
would be faster than calling times()?
Am I better off using gettimeofday() anyway because of
its higher precision and clearer specification?
