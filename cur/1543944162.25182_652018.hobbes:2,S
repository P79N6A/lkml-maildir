yup, in many cases that's pretty easy to do.  But people dive straight
for the end result, which of course provides the cleanest outcome but
isn't really very real-wordly.
Another thing we could do when these things happen is all gang up on Linus
and ask him to merge the API change into mainline.  Because often the
change can be done in two stages: 1) change the interface then 2) add the code
in the callee which _uses_ that changed interface.  Part 1 is an obviously-safe
do-nothing change and fixes the merge problems.  Part 2 is at a single site
and can be merged in 2.6.x+1.
There are lots of well-known things we can do to simplify Stephen's life. 
But first we have to have the motivation to do that thing.  If linux-next
proves to be useful and developers are seeing good testing and
bug-reporting coming out of it then I expect people will be happy to make
such accommodations.  Let's see if we can get to that stage first.
A fully running and successful linux-next won't change outcomes a lot, I
expect.  It will help to pick up on obvious bugs and build errors and
bisection breakages prior to them hitting mainline.  But we fix those
things by -rc1 or -rc2 anyway.  So it's just a time-shift, causing no great
change in the final 2.6.x.
linux-next will do little to solve our (IMO) largest problem: unfixed
regressions and bugs.  otoh it will free up a lot of my time and
hair-tearing, so I can devote more attention to the bugs.  (where
"attention" usually= "sending irritiating emails")
