No. As you quote below, it does a lock addl which is a serializing
operation.
lfence is the same but doesn't serialize write operations and is
probably more efficient since it is designed for the purpose of
serializing load operations.
mfence is like lfence but also serializes writes.
However I don't have a Pentium 4 so I haven't done any checking or
benchmarks.

I agree and the patch only adds sfence _if_ CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE is
defined (and CONFIG_X86_MMXEXT is also defined).

This isn't changed.
