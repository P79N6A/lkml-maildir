Congrats. WRT the 1st, 3rd, and 5th item you are now ahead of mainline's
stack. :-)

Actually there are also eth1394 and pcilynx to be pulled over. Eth1394
should be quite easy to do for anybody after iso reception is settled in
your stack. Pcilynx could follow depending on developer interest. It's
increasingly rare hardware and the few old machines which have it can be
cheaply upgraded to OHCI (which performs better for SBP-2 anyway).

Consider using libraw1394 right from the start of this porting project.
If there is only one libraw1394 (which works with raw1394 and with
fw-device-cdev), enthusiasts might have an easier time to test your stack.
