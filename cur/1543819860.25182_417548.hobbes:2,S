[PATCH] apm: fix Armada laptops again
Fix the "apm: set display: Interface not engaged" error on Armada laptops
again.

  I think this is fine.  It seems to me that this may be the fault of one or
  both of the APM solutions handling this situation in a non-standard way, but
  since APM is used very little on the Geode, and I have direct access to our
  BIOS folks, if this problem comes up with a customer again, we'll solve it
  from the firmware.
