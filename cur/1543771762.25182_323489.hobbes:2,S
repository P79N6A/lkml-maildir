I'm using upx-ucl-beta v1.91+0.20030910cvs-2 debian package.
Command line:
upx-ucl-beta -9 -f bupxImage-2.6.12-rc6
-rw-r--r--  3 root root 618442 Jun  6 16:14 bupxImage-2.6.12-rc6
-rwxrwxrwx  1 root root 669106 Jun  6 16:14 bzImage-2.6.12-rc6*
50664 bytes savings.
the kernel I have there is 100% modular except that ramdisk is compiled in. 
It was also compiled with -Os (Optimize for size config option) using gcc
3.3.5.
