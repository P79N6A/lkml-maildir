And you won't see one, either.  You cannot change the
semantics of uninterruptible sleep, nor can the OOM
killer change other device driver things.
This means the OOM killer has little choice but to
"hope for the best" and pick another process if the
first process chosen can't exit.
If you think you can fix all drivers to work fine
when tasks suddenly disappear, I guess you might
wnat to create such a patch ...

Rik
