At least on my hardware, the cfs in 2.6.22-git13 runs as smoothly as the 
perfect smoothness of cfs-v13, with two tuning changes:
  sched_stat_granularity_ns = 1000000
  sched_features = 14
The change in "features" made a major improvement.
Having identified the cause of the better smoothness in the older 
version, I'm going to put my efforts into other characterizations. The 
test source will remain on the server, but I'm won't do more with it 
unless someone finds it useful.
