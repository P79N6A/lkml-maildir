Preallocated memory, but yes it makes an assumption that the stack is in
a fit state.

(I'm not sure I understand what you mean by a "GC")
This shows just how impractical it is to catch SIGBUS after malloc
(which is just an mmap with large enough chunks).
Here's a short list of problems:
- Signal handler may be paged out. Solution: mlock
- Jump location variable may be paged out. Solution: mlock
- Object instance cleanup needed, with much care taken about concurrency
issues.
- Hard to judge exactly where the fault occurred. Solution: COW all
pages after malloc, as it can only then happen in that operation. This
brings up:
- Inefficient.
- An absolute bastard to use. Especially if you're threaded
(/impossible)
It's quite ridiculous that anyone can advocate this kind of solution,
really.
