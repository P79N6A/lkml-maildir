I think what I wanted got burried in a small geometry war.

Not the initial problem.
Let me try to state what I originally wanted.
I am currently using edd to get the legacy heads and sectors then using that
and the size of the disk, I deduce the cylinders.  Works great, no problems.
fdisk will let me specify and it works great.  Ok, so I can do this guessing
game just fine.
Now, i have programs that I can't tell it the geometry (which it does use
and requires to be correct.  My guesses using edd are correct).  I was using
/proc/ide/hdX/settings to tell the kernel what geometry I want so the
programs that can only ask the kernel can get it right.
2.6.12-rc2.  Works great.  But what's this?  it's obsolete?  Ok, it's
obsolete, what is the non-obsolete way of SETTING the geometry.  I looked at
ide.c and there's no HDSETGEO.  I considered writing this myself or
unobsolete the /proc interface for my kernels, but if there's a "right" way
of doing this, I'd rather do it.
If the "right" way is via IOCTL, my scripts are written in perl that do the
bulk of the guess work.
I did not want this to be a geometry flame war.  I realize linux doesn't
give a flying whatever about the geometry (only the number of sectors).  The
systems I'm doing this with run OSs other than linux and they do care (i
wish they didn't!)  I wasn't asking this for someone to tell me I didn't
need it.
