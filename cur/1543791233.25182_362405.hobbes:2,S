Hi I've put a server together, and it has a
Marvell Technology Group Ltd. MV88SX6041 4-port SATA II PCI-X Controller 
After a great deal of work I've got it booting with the .25 version of the marvel driver. 
But It's generating many many of these kinds of errors.
 Assertion failed! 0 == (sg_len & ~MV_DMA_BOUNDARY),drivers/scsi/sata_mv.c,mv_fill_sg,line=798
How close is the driver to being reliable enough to use in a single drive
environment? 
is there anything I can do to help debug further?
