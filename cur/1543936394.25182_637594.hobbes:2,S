According to the HW folks - it is exactly as Pierre indicated - in theory it 
should work, 4-bit MMC requires usage of different set of commands as 
compared to 4-bit SD, so it should be just software - although no one has 
tested it yet.
So I guess this is back on Bryan/Cliff to make work....
Thanks for pushing back.
