The fact that the syscall table is R/W can be used to an advantage
for security. Yes!
After all modules are loaded, you (startup) loads a module that
makes the module-loader stuff return -ENOSYS. Then, nobody can
load any new modules. The running kernel is (more) secure.
You just need to make sure that all modules that you will need
are loaded before you do this. Also, you don't need to disable
auto module unloading because, nothing can be unloaded as
well.
