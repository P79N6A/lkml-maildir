Hi all,
we have big Problems with IBM Netfinity Servers with ServerWorks ChipSet 3HE. The machine comes with an IBM ServeRaid Controller 4L and an Raid 0 is build with 4 Harddisks. If a dd is made on the raid (dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda1 bs=1M count=2000; sync) and the sync starts all 4 CPUs are 100% buisy. Till the sync is done, the server is not able to do anything else.
On a SuperMicro 8060 with Chipset ServerWorks 3HE happens the same. 
Any suggestions ?
Tanks
