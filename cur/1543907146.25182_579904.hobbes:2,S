Sure.  This would be an okay way to handle legacy devices that
are connected in inventive ways: add "reg-shift" and/or "big-endian"
properties.  We should make sure this is documented in the
appropriate bindings though, don't just assume it will work.
For non-legacy devices, please just use the "compatible"
property to figure out the endianness etc.; it is a bad idea
to make a "blablabla-big-endian" compatible value, but you can
almost often just use a more specific model name instead; and
typically the device has some other quirks anyway ;-)

Don't treat your ad-hockery ad hoc, that way leads to insanity :-)
It's quite important to use good names for all new properties
you define, so you naturally end up with similar names for
similar purposes.  Of course it isn't a *requirement*, you're
right about that.
