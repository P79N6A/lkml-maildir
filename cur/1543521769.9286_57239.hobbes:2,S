I guess the bigger question is whether it is (past) time to upgrade to
glibc2.  This has been weighing heavily on me for the past several
kernel releases, as I have a libc5/gcc-2.7.2.3 system that has been
working just fine even with the latest development kernels.  The
separation of kernel and userspace includes is a *good* thing, but
some packages naturally seem to ride the fence (such as the pcmcia-cs
utilities).  With libc5, anything that includes <signal.h> is going to
get bitten by the old_uid_t buglet mentioned above.
Since I did not see a posting elsewhere, I should mention that the
same libc5/gcc-2.7.2.3 system had problems with the final stage of
the 2.3.39 kernel build.  Specifically, the `build` command would not
build because old_uid_t and old_gid_t are not defined unless __KERNEL__
is defined: <sys/types.h> problem with libc5.
