It's been a number of months since I build a custom kernel with the libata
incorporated to deal with multiple Promise EIDE controller card's 'DMA
Expiry' errors.
I'd like to re-build basically the same thing with an updated kernel and
updates libata.  Could someone point me into the right direction to achieve
this?
Thanks in advance
Erik.
