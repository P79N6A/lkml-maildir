Roman, Your questions are misguided.
A larger dev_t is infrastructure.
A sand road that is turned into an asphalt road.
Nobody has to use this improved infrastructure.
But many uses are conceivable.
Long ago I reserved 2^40 values for dynamically
assigned anonymous devices. Convenient, a very
small fraction of the available space.
I can imagine that there will be people wanting
to take part of the available space for a universal
hash of disk serial number or partition label or
I don't know what, so that devices are addressable
by content instead of path.
A lot of room can be put to many uses.
