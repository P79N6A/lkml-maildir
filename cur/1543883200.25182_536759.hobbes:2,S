Yes that is the patch with problems.

Ok.
Right now Xen is the only paravirtualization solution that wants to make
page tables read only.
The current Xen methodology is to setup the identity mapping with the
initial page table set to read-only, before calling paging_init().
kernel_physical_mapping_init was modified to skip pages which are
already in the page table.
However in other cases this causes us to fail to setup important bits
like PSE and NX where we want them on the page tables.  So for the
leaf pages we need to continue setting things at least on real hardware.
The current plan was that Jeremy was going to go and modify the
Xen set_pte early in boot, to preserve to mask off _PAGE_RW in
early boot for pages that don't currently have _PAGE_RW set.
So the fix is two parts.
- Part one unconditionally set the page table entries for
  4K and pse pages.
- Fix the Xen set_pte.
Short of making the identity mapping setup paravirt specific 
I don't know what we can do.
