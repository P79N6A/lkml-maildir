This could be done in 2 ways.
1. Make oom_adj itself strict.(based on some other parameter?)
- Adds to confusion whether the current oom_adj is a strict value or the usual 
suggestion. 
- It would disable the oom_adj suggestion which could have been used till now. 
- It is a public interface, and changing that might break some one's script.
2. Add addtional parameter, say  /proc/<pid>/oom_order
- Not easy to use.
- Say I had assigned the oom.victim to a task and it had forked a lot. Now to 
change the value for all the tasks it is easier with cgroups.
- Some optimization that Kame specified earlier would be harder to achieve.
Basically oom-controller implements option 2, using cgroups which can be 
thought of as a modern interface for proc. Also it could be used along with 
other cgroup controllers like the group scheduler. Say you have 2 groups of 
tasks, clubed as entertainment and science, you could use the group scheduler 
to give more CPU bandwidth to science and instruct oom-controller to kill 
entertainment tasks in case of OOM situation.
