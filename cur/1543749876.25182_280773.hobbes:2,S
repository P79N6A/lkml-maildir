What kinds of on-access event driving is there for Linux?  I'm looking
at Dazuko[1] right now, but not sure about what else is out there.  I'm
sure I've seen several; is there anything in the kernel?
These things would be good for ClamAV[2] and for systems similar to the
Zero-install system[3], although 0install uses its own stuff.
