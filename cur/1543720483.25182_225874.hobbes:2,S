  Hi Felipe ....
  Lucky one ...
  I do not even use PCMCIA and don't have the stuff
  compiled in or use the modules ... but the reaction
  to echo -n '3' >/proc/acpi/sleep is weired.
  Somthing like (1) The first time nothing happens
  and (2) On the second run the machine reboots....
  Up until now I've been slowly upgrading my kernel
  from minimal functionality to almost perfect
  now USB, and ALSA has been added to the kernel
  and I still can suspend/resume....
  Now of cause I'm wandering what actually triggers
  the crash ....
  That might take some time ....
  Thanks for the tip
  Sebastian
