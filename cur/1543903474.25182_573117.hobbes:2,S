Sounds great, but it may be advisable to hook this into the partition 
modification routines instead of mkfs/fsck.  Which would mean that the 
partition manager could ask the kernel to instruct its fs subsystem to 
update the backup partition table for each known fs-type that supports such 
a feature.
