Please go back and fix the original issue!
If you are having problems caused by double-probing, the fix is NOT to 
remove one the probes.  The fix is to ensure use of proper resource 
reservation, and in some cases, add co-driver-awareness.
Your entire justification for the patch has not been proven, since you 
demonstrably have not solved the original bug for which your patch was 
intended to solve.
