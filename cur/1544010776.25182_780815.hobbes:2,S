It is there, it is just in the git -M rename diff output rather than
"normal" diff.  See the sections like:
diff --git a/fs/dnotify.c b/fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c
similarity index 100%
rename from fs/dnotify.c
rename to fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c
This type of patch can be applied directly to your git tree and makes
review trivial.....
If people who will put this into a subsystem would prefer the long diff
I'll gladly resend.
I'll agree it isn't required but the other 2 aren't going to apply
without it, and it does clean up fs.  I'd much rather get this early
than in the middle somewhere since others are also looking at changing
this subsystem at the same time....     It can be dropped it others
agree....
