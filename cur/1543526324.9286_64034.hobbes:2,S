Hi!
Why do I get:
eth0: Transmit timed out: status 0050  0000 at 40684057/40684057 command 000ca000.
eth0: Trying to restart the transmitter...
eth0: Transmit timed out: status 0050  0000 at 54261403/54261403 command 000ca000.

with this interface under heavy load?
Even more strange: I have changed the interface for a newer one: a 82558
to a 82559. Now /proc/pci says:
Ethernet controller: Intel 82557 (rev 8)
????
Why 557???
Might this be why it does not work correctly?
I am using it 100Mbps FD
