Hi, Mattew,
thanks for your comments.

Yes, we can do this. But it's kinda early to add the
thermal_cooling_device struct to the acpi_device struct now.
I don't think any other individual drivers know whether they can or how
to throttle the device except processor, fan and lcd currently.
Just like I don't think lcd should be used for ACPI thermal management
before I saw it is listed in _TZD and intel_menlow requires to throttle
it when overheating, why not let the individual drivers implement the
callbacks if there is clearly a request to do this.
And we can add this to the generic acpi_device struct then if this is a
common feature for all ACPI devices.

Well, you're right.
But in order to throttle the lcd, this is reasonable, right?
Thanks,
