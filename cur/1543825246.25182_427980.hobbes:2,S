+	bool "Prove spin-locking correctness"

+	 This feature enables the kernel to prove that all spinlock
+	 locking that occurs in the kernel runtime is mathematically
+	 correct: that under no circumstance could an arbitrary (and
+	 not yet triggered) combination of observed spinlock locking
+	 sequences (on an arbitrary number of CPUs, running an
+	 arbitrary number of tasks and interrupt contexts) cause a
+	 deadlock.
+
+	 In short, this feature enables the kernel to report spinlock
+	 deadlocks before they actually occur.
+
+	 The proof does not depend on how hard and complex a
+	 deadlock scenario would be to trigger: how many
+	 participant CPUs, tasks and irq-contexts would be needed
+	 for it to trigger. The proof also does not depend on
+	 timing: if a race and a resulting deadlock is possible
+	 theoretically (no matter how unlikely the race scenario
+	 is), it will be proven so and will immediately be
+	 reported by the kernel (once the event is observed that
+	 makes the deadlock theoretically possible).
+
+	 If a deadlock is impossible (i.e. the locking rules, as
+	 observed by the kernel, are mathematically correct), the
+	 kernel reports nothing.
+
+	 NOTE: this feature can also be enabled for rwlocks, mutexes
+	 and rwsems - in which case all dependencies between these
+	 different locking variants are observed and mapped too, and
+	 the proof of observed correctness is also maintained for an
+	 arbitrary combination of these separate locking variants.
