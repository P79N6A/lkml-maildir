I'm using 2.4.5-pre5 and before on 2.4.x (without -ac) and don't have such
problem.
boston:root:/tmp> mount -o loop ram /mnt
boston:root:/tmp> umount /mnt
boston:root:/tmp> strace losetup -d /dev/loop0
execve("/sbin/losetup", ["losetup", "-d", "/dev/loop0"], [/* 47 vars */])
= 0
brk(0)                                  = 0x804b408
open("/etc/ld.so.preload", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
Did you umount the loopback device or ensure that nobody is using it?
