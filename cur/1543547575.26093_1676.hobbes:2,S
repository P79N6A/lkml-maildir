In this case you really want to do a user space driver implementation
to avoid the cost of context switches. This is how a lot of people use
the Myrinet (afaik) and there were also some of the guys at CERN who
did a similar driver for the AceNIC at the same time I wrote the first
version of the 'normal' driver.
