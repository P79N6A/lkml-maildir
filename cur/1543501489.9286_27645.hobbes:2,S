	Hehe, there's LOTS of esoteric stuff in the kernel. :)  How big
can your drivers be?  I know personally I'm ALOT happier when stuff is
in the kernel as opposted to when I have to go hunt it down...

	Hmm..  Is modutils under RedHat modified then?  Or does modutils
somehow pull something different than what uname -r reports?  It seems
to me that modprobe/insmod/etc have to have some way of knowing where
the stuff is, hopefully it's just pulling something else, and there isn't
a RedHat-specific version of modutils...

	Well, except that the version of the kernel in /usr/include/linux is
not always the same as the version of the kernel you have running (If you
compile your own).  It used to be a link to /usr/src/linux/include/linux,
but that is no longer the case under glibc2.

	Yikes, but the only other thing I can think of would be like finding
it on your own, or only supporting certain versions of like RedHat w/
specific kernels (Yes, very, very ugly).

	Hrm.  I don't know what to tell you about dealing w/ the kinds of
users you described, however, for myself (And no, I'm not really a kernel
developer or anything), I much prefer to find the driver in the kernel,
and the docs for configing the driver in the Documentation/ directory.
	Now if you've got seperate proggies that are required to work
w/ the thing, perhaps a link from the info in the Documentation/ directory
would suffice.  That at least is how I prefer it. :)  But then, I'm pretty
familiar w/ linux...
