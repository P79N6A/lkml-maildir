I have problems with udev and latest -mm.
2.6.13 boots fine, but 2.6.13-mm1 blocks when starting udev.
System is Mandriva Cooker. As cooker, things are changing fast (initscripts,
udev, etc), but the fact is that with the same setup, plain .13 boots
and -mm1 blocks. Udev is 068 version.
Any idea about what can be the reason ?
TIA
