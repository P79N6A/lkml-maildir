That particular flash drive had terrible througput.
But there are other alternatives.  I use a kingston 4GB 
compactflash card as a disk, and it reads 22MB/s, according to
specs and tests with hdparm.  And it writes 16MB/s.  
Much better than the sorry thing in that test, about the same
read speed as their worst platter-based harddisk.  And of course it still have
the nice seek times of non-rotating media. :-)
