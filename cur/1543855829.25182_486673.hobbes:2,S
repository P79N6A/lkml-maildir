Here's my fix.  Unlike the fix Kay suggested, it causes at worst only
a minor loss of functionality, so that tradeoff seems fair for a late
merge.  I audited all the drivers using the relevant APIs, and I can't
see many (if any!) folk hitting problems from this.

============== CUT HERE
We've had recent reports of some legacy "probe the hardware" style platform
drivers having nasty problems with hotplug support.
The core issue is that those drivers don't fully conform to the driver model.
They assume a role that's the responsibility of infrastructure code:  they
create their own device nodes.  But hotplugging relies on drivers to have split
those roles into different modules, hence the problems.  If the driver creates
nodes for devices that don't exist, the "modprobe $MODALIAS" step of hotplugging
can become an endless loop *when driver load aborts* (it's safe otherwise).
This fix adds a per-device flag saying whether its driver can't be hotplugged,
which is set by APIs used for "probe the hardware" style drivers.  The flag
is used to bypass relevant hotplug logic (setting the $MODALIAS environment
variable) for those problematic drivers.
The minor glitch is that in a few cases those APIs are used by platform code,
instead of by drivers.  Examples include most places where a "pcspkr" device is
created (although a recent un-merged patch fixed that for X86_PC), or the way
platform devices are created for OpenFirmware nodes ... all those cases seem
to kick in before userspace (and hotplug) is active though.
So the net of this patch is removing some nasty failures with legacy drivers,
while retaining hotplug capability for those platform drivers which are well
behaved (the majority).
