This single command line works fine here. Perhaps you have used the same
destination a second time on tunnel "t12".
Check this, because of a bug in "ip", adding of tunnel with the same
destination silenty fails (exit code = 0).
This is why my initscript-ipv6 package checks whether destination address
is already applied on another tunnel.
