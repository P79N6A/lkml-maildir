We have a hack in BK for this, at least I think we do, where we can look at
the time stamps to notice that you haven't modified the files.  We don't 
use it because of NFS screwing up timestamps.  I suppose we could enable
it on a per repository basis so that if you knew you were running NTP or
some other thing to keep your time stamps right, then we could diff as
fast as we can stat.
