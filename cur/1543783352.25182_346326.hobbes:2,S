Why should I check for newer firmware!? I don't understand that point of view. 
The device works without any problems with 2.6.13-ck1 as 2.6.13-rc6-mm1 and 
before kernels. So there is no need to check the firmware imho.
I don't think that it makes any difference if I power up first or plug in 
first. The device is recognized when I power it on, so it would be the same 
when I power it on and connect after that imho.
I will try to get the backtraces from the kernel, this should make debugging 
easier.
