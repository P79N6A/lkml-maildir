Hi Rajat, you can learn more about the OSHP method by reading the PCI
express spec.  It is used to tell an ACPI bios that the OS will be
handling the hotplug events natively.  It may be that your BIOS does
not allow native hotplug for pcie, in which case you need to be using
the acpiphp driver instead of the pciehp driver.  You could just try
modprobing acpiphp and see if this will handle the hotplug events.  A
recent version of lspci (which understands pcie) will tell you as well
if pcie hotplug capability is supported (lspci -vv).
