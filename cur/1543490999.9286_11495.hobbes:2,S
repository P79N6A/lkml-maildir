Indeed.
However, I think it would make sense to make the "plug" not actually be a
request itself, but just a flag. Making it a request was a nice way of
minimally impacting the code, but as we will need to have a per-entity
structure to keep track of the per-request-list lock status for
re-entrancy protection, we might as well just make the plug more obvious,
and make it a real flag. 
That's just an implementation detail, but it would make it more obvious
what the test is.
