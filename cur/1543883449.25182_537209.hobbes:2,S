Hi!
I tried cfs-v7 where Ingo fixed a 'big bug' he found while looking at the 
debug data I provided to him.
Well, its rocking now on both my Amarok machine, the T23, and the T42. 
Absolutely smooth music playback, no matter what. No freezes anymore 
whatsoever.
Even when stress testing with my usual naive user tests, having make-kpkg 
linux_image running, starting tons of apps and solid moving Amarok window 
like mad - that was on my T23.  On my T42 I repeated that Kaffeine test, 
playing a video with it, while moving the window like mad, no complete 
freezes anymore...
Congrats, Ingo! cfs-v7 is rocking now ;-).
Tested on 2.6.21.1 with sws2 2.2.9.13, dynticks and CONFIG_HZ=300 as the 
older kernels I tested with.
That is without X renicing just like I run sd-0.46 as well.
Now it seems that I have *two* schedulers to choose from. ;-) I am 
satisfied with both sd-0.46 and cfs-v7 now.
Actually cfs-v7 feels a bit smoother for me now. Thats nothing concrete at 
the moment, nothing I can get a hold of it.  cfs-v7 just feels a bit 
smoother to me.
Will do some longer term testing with cfs-v7 now.
Regards,
