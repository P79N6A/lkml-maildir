In many Unices, crucial kernel threads run at realtime priority with a
static priority higher than is accessible to user code.
That being said, however, you've got to be a privileged user to set
real time very high priority on a thread, and if you do, you'd better
know what you're doing.  Any SCHED_FIFO thread should run for a time,
then sleep for a time, or it *will* DOS everything else on the
processor.
