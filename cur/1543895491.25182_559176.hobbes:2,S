Or not in the kernel at all.  I've been doing versioning of the types I 
described for years with user space code and I don't remember feeling that 
I compromised in order not to involve the kernel.
Of course, if you want to do it with snapshots and COW, you'll have to ask 
where in the kernel to put that, but that's not a file versioning 
question; it's the larger snapshot question.
