Hum, IMO this should be in the "2.5" list because 
1) It involves changes to the PageDirty scheme if we want to support write
clustering for normal writes, and not only shared writable mappings like
we do now. (basically this changes are in Chris Mason's patch)
2) It involves changes to the filesystem code if we want to support
generic write clustering for fs's which use block_write_full_page.
