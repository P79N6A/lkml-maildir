   Are you willing to consider this a critical bug that deserves to be fixed 
   before 2.4.0?
If the problem only impacts User-mode Linux, it's hard for me to justify
hanging the "critical" label on it.  However I'm willing to look at the
patch, bless it, and send it on to Linus (who as you know sometimes is a
softy about such things.  :-)   
I'm pretty sure that we'd be able to get it into 2.4.x, x > 0 at the
very least, since the patch is highly localized, won't break anything,
and is easy to test for correctness.
