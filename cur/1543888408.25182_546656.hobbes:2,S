Well that is the kind of thing I was hoping to avoid for the reasons of 
complexity.  I think that the actual implementation would be more 
complex than it sounds and possibly require multiple runs down the list 
of moveable tasks which would be bad for overhead.
Basically, I don't think that the problem is serious enough to warrant a 
complex solution.  But I may be wrong about how complex the 
implementation would be.
