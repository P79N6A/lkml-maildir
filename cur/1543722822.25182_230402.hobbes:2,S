We should get our basics right first. We _do_ need quotas!! Without any 
quota system how are we going to avoid a malicious user  from taking 
away all the space to keep other people starving? In EQFS also this can 
happen, but we are giving *controlled flexibility* to the user. He is 
having some stretching power but not beyond a certain limit. And do you 
think users are sincere enough to clean up there files when they are done?

User is the king, he decides what files should be elastic and what not. 
This can always be controlled.
