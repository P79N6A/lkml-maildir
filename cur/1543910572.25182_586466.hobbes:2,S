We cannot reclaim the page as long as the I/O is not complete. If you 
have too many anonymous pages and the rest of memory is dirty then you can 
get into OOM scenarios even without this patch.

Its not that different. Pages are pinned during writeout from reclaim and 
it is not clear when the write will complete. There are no bounds that I 
know in reclaim for the writeback of dirty anonymous pages.
But some throttling function like for dirty pages is likely needed for 
network traffic.
