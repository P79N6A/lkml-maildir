Here it a first shot, twd_i387_to_fxsr is guaranteed to not add any
new bug (since there are only 65536 cases, I wrote a short test program
to check that the results are the same). 
For the other way around, I only corrected the most glaring error: that
the sign never affects the tag. Some obscure corner cases may still be
wrong, but at least now negative zero and positive infinity and NaNs are
handled correctly.  Performance could also be improved by handling
separately the common case of an empty FP stack.
Now the question: is it worth bloating the code to exactly return the tag
values of a 387 (I actually find that the Intel doc is confusing, what 
is the state of the tag word after an fnsave when MMX is in use, 0xaaaa
or 0x0000, not counting the bugs in this area) ? 
My feeling is that the only important information in the tag field is
empty/not empty. Does any code (debuggers, etc...) actually rely on the
tags for anything else ?
Patch relative to 2.4.0-test9.
