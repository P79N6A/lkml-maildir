Both, most use UP exclusively. You know, SMP costs serious money.
Actually very few people can walk over to some colleagues to gain access
to a 16-CPU box.

Then show some creativity, if you must publish statistics on subsystems
having most inexplicable uses of the BKL. Make it a challenge, not an attack.

Good - which lock is next in your noble quest for scalability?

Yes, please. "Linus, let's rip out some random locks which offend my sense
of beauty" tends to piss off people. Linus might even agree, but you don't
