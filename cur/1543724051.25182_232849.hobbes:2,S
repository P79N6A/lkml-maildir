hm.  You get an eGrump for sending two patchs in one email.  Surprisingly
nice numbers though.
How come vm_swappiness gets squared?  That's the mysterious "bias

Please define this new term "application pages"?
Those si_swapinfo() and si_meminfo() calls need to come out of there.
A diff against Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt will be needed sometime,
please.
