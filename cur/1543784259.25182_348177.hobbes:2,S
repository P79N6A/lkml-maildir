great.

Yeah that's right. At least with romfs_get_size(), we can check the
return val to see it ok or not. it might be better if we have
    mapp->size = PAGE_ALIGN(romfs_get_size((struct romfs_super_block *)&_ebss));
    if (mapp->size != -1)
kind of code. what we can do once we detected mismatched magic number
is deferment story, though. ;)
