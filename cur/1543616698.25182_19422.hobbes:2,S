	And at the total opposite of the spectrum you have IrNET, as
it is implemented in kernekl 2.4.X, that pass PPP packets on an IrDA
socket in the kernel without going through the socket API. But that's
the solution only if you don't mind debugging kernel code...
	BTW, I don't understand why the socket architecture would need
to be modified. You just need a user space or a kernel space wrapper.
