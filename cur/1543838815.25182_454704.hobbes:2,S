Such kind of memory management is less efficient than the one 
making decisions based on global shortages and global LRU alogrithm.
The problem here is that doing swap out takes more expensive disk I/O
influencing other users.
So throttling algorithms if wanted should be optional, not mandatory.
Lets postpone it and concentrate on the core.
Thanks,
