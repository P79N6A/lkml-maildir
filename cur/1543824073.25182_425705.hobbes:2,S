OK, i understand this, but buffer-cache is an optional thing, and looks like
really simple (for me), and i cannot understand why cannot use exactly for
buffering the highmem...
On my concentrator the nbd-client uses ~ 3.5GB of ram for PAGE-cache.
The buffer cache why can not use the highmem?
Whats the difference?
Cheers,
