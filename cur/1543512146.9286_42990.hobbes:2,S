Why it's so important ?

And what if I'm not want Unix ? Keep something to be "unix way" just for sake
of keeping it "unix way" looks really stupid to me.

Devfs can do much more then just expanded dev_t ...

On other hand adding devfs breaks MUCH less things.

Hmm. With devfs you can avoid all this. Even if it's not "Unix way".

Correct. And when device is identified by name and not by major/minor number
internally you have no such problem in first place.

Which POSIX standard says how unix-like kernel acts inside ???

You hardly will have more then 65536 devices (dev_t size) and still now
we have size of dev_t as limiting factor...

Unfortunatelly dev_t structure is also not "unix way". Since you can not
use assignment in C for dev_t. And if we are going to go out of "unix way"
anyway then why it should be dev_t definition and not some other thing ?
