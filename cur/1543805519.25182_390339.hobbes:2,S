My test program (below) doesn't use CLONE_VM.  With your patch the stack
data showed up only in the parent process, probably due to copy-on-write,
and the child gets SIGSEGV trying to transfer control to address 0.

I patched arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c to add a boot option "nox86sep"
similar to "nofxsr" and sure enough the test program dies when booting
with that option:
        $ ./test_clone2.ex
        SIGSEGV accessing 0x00000000 from EIP 0x00000000
        cloned; ret = 621
Your fix for this should work fine.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#  define SYSCALL_STR "int $0x80\n\t"
#else
#  define SYSCALL_STR "call 0xffffe400\n\t"
#endif
#define CLONE	120
#define FLAGS	0

unsigned long *child_stack_ptr = &child_stack[2047];
struct sigaction sa;
int ret;
static void handler(int nr, siginfo_t *si, void *vuc)
{
	struct ucontext *uc = (struct ucontext *)vuc;
	struct sigcontext *sc = (struct sigcontext *)&uc->uc_mcontext;
	printf("SIGSEGV accessing 0x%08x from EIP 0x%08x\n",
	       (unsigned long)si->si_addr, sc->eip);
	sa.sa_handler = SIG_DFL;
	sa.sa_flags = 0;
	sigaction(SIGSEGV, &sa, NULL);
}
int main(int argc, char * const argv[])
{
	sa.sa_sigaction = handler;
	sa.sa_flags = SA_SIGINFO;
	sigaction(SIGSEGV, &sa, NULL);
	asm volatile(
		SYSCALL_STR
		: "=a"(ret)
		: "a"(CLONE), "b"(FLAGS), "c"(child_stack_ptr)
		: "memory"
	);
	printf("cloned; ret = %d\n", ret);
	_exit(0);
}
