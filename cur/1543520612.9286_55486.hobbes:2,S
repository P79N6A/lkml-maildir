Hi guys,
I did a few more changes, fixed 1 bug, migrated modules/* into kdb_extra.c
so you don't have to modprobe kdb_something - all the features are nicely
monolithic (why would someone even think about modularizing kdb?).
The latest patch is at:
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/kdb/kdb-2.3.35-pre6.patch.gz
Enjoy,
Tigran.
