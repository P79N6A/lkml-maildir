That's a bit weird as nothing should be different, I've just built
vesafb into my kernel and booted and it works fine.. (with the oops
patch...)
vesafb: framebuffer at 0xe0000000, mapped to 0xe0880000, using 3072k,
total 131072k
vesafb: mode is 1024x768x16, linelength=2048, pages=84
vesafb: protected mode interface info at c000:56cd
vesafb: scrolling: redraw
vesafb: Truecolor: size=0:5:6:5, shift=0:11:5:0

all good here... I'm trying to see if this could be a via only issue,
or something even more tricky....
If you could apply the patch I've attached (just adds some debug...)
it'll narrow it down a small bit where it is failing for me...
Thanks,
Dave.
