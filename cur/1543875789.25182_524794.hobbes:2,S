This was my first idea, too. But then i found this entry in the
Changelog of the synaptics driver:
- In the DeviceOn() function, if opening the device node fails, try to
  auto-detect the correct event device again. This fixes some problems
  which occur after a suspend/resume cycle or after rmmod/insmod-ing
  the psmouse kernel driver.

Okay. This strengthens above statement. And udev is too slow to create
the devices, while the driver already scanned the directory.
