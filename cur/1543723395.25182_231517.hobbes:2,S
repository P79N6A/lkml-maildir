 From the X86-64 patch release notes of Andi Kleen:
Reports that dual Tyan S2885 and S2880 can lock up when multiple IDE 
channels are stressed in parallel. "noapic" or "ideX=serialize" seems to 
work around it. Andre Hedrick thinks it's a generic bug/race in the IDE 
code.
Looks like you have a similar problem on a UP board.
