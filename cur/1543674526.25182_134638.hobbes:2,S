Any messages in dmesg? It sounds like io to the drive stops completely,
and that is why you see mke2fs being stuck in blk_congestion_wait
(mke2fs eats most of the requests, the queue gets marked congested). If
io isn't progressing, then the queue won't have the congestion flag
cleared again.
You need to give a lot more hardware details, see REPORTING-BUGS
