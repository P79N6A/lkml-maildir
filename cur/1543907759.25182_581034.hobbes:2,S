+ * fs/logfs/memtree.c	- Simple In-memory B+Tree
+ *
+ * As should be obvious for Linux kernel code, license is GPLv2
+ *
+ * Copyright (c) 2007 Joern Engel <joern@logfs.org>
+ *
+ *
+ * This could possibly get moved to lib/.
+ *
+ * A relatively simple B+Tree implementation.  I have written it as a learning
+ * excercise to understand how B+Trees work.  Turned out to be useful as well.
+ *
+ * B+Trees can be used similar to Linux radix trees (which don't have anything
+ * in common with textbook radix trees, beware).  Prerequisite for them working
+ * well is that access to a random tree node is much faster than a large number
+ * of operations within each node.
+ *
+ * Disks have fulfilled the prerequite for a long time.  More recently DRAM
+ * has gained similar properties, as memory access times, when measured in cpu
+ * cycles, have increased.  Cacheline sizes have increased as well, which also
+ * helps B+Trees.
+ *
+ * Compared to radix trees, B+Trees are more efficient when dealing with a
+ * sparsely populated address space.  Between 25% and 50% of the memory is
+ * occupied with valid pointers.  When densely populated, radix trees contain
+ * ~98% pointers - hard to beat.  Very sparse radix trees contain only ~2%
+ * pointers.
+ *
+ * This particular implementation stores pointers identified by a long value.
+ * Storing NULL pointers is illegal, lookup will return NULL when no entry
+ * was found.
+ *
+ * Two tricks were used that are not commonly found in textbooks.  First, the
+ * lowest values are to the right, not to the left.  All used slots within a
+ * node are on the left, all unused slots contain NUL values.  Most operations
+ * simply loop once over all slots and terminate on the first NUL.
+ *
+ * Second trick is to special-case the key "0" or NUL.  As seen above, this
+ * value indicates an unused slot, so such a value should not be stored in the
+ * tree itself.  Instead it is stored in the null_ptr field in the btree_head.
+ */

+
+/*
+ * Prerequisite of B+Trees performing well is that node lookup is much slower
+ * than a large number of operations within a node.  That can be true if the
+ * node size is identical to cacheline size.  All that is highly
+ * machine-dependent, just like the #define below is not.
+ *
+ * Patches to do something smarter are welcome.  Just beware that too small
+ * node with less than 8 slots have a bad fan-out and won't perform well
+ * either.
