Preventing the script from reading stdin is pretty severe don't you
think?  Alternatives:
  - Open fd 3, pass /proc/self/fd/3 as the script name.
  - Pass /proc/self/script as the script name and add code to proc
    to support this -- this provides the interpreter with fds 0,1 & 2
    as the only open ones which it may be expecting.
