You have to PTRACE_ATTACH it first (I guess that is useless SYSV heritage)
I'm pretty sure that 2.0 required it too.
I would propose to drop this silly requirement in 2.3, and instead forbid
the really bad uses of /proc/*/mem (e.g. mmaping /proc/self/mem causes
lots of problem in the VM subsystem, unfortunately dosemu depends on it)
