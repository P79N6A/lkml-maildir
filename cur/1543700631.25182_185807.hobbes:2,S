I agree w/ Christoph...  overly defensive programming like this just
creates a new class of programmer errors, doesn't really solve anything.
It's standard Linux kernel style, and making code look like all other
code has benefits in review and debugging.  Finally, the programmer
should be paying attention to what kernel APIs he/she uses, and add
headers accordingly.
