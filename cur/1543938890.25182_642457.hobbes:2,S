Hi, andrew
For the patch bluetooth-rfcomm-tty_close-before-destruct.patch I have to rethinkabout it.
1. The subject is not correct, should be rfcomm-tty-destroy-before-tty_close.
2. Don't know what I was thinking that time, could you replace it with the following better one? Sorry for that.
---
rfcomm dev could be deleted in tty_hangup, so we must not call rfcomm_dev_del again to prevent from destroying rfcomm dev before tty close.
