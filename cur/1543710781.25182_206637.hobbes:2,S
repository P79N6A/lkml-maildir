I'd love to do that too. Unfortunately I'm really busy with my new job,
so things have progressed far more slowly than I'd have liked. I'm also
not sure how to deal with some of the changes that just about completely
rewrite sections.

I spent a long time trying to get the freezer working reliably with the
kind of implementation Pavel uses. The problem I kept running into time
and again was that you can't know dependancies between processes when it
comes to signalling them; process A might happily be frozen, but then
process B can't be frozen becaue it is waiting on something process A
has (eg ls/nfsd). By tracking which processes are in those
'can't-be-frozen-here' sections, I have managed to make the freezer far
more reliable, even under high load. Michael Frank has done some extreme
stress testing and can verify this.
