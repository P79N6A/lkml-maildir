I've thought about that too.  Menuconfig already has magic code to
append ' (NEW)' if it hasn't seen a symbol before.
Your proposed change, however, cannot be easily parsed until we make
'$' optional (and deprecated) in dep_* tags.  The existing Configure
and Menuconfig borrow the /bin/sh parser which, if allowed to see
"$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL", will expand it too early to be of use.
