i is `the left operand'. If foo() returns 0, i becomes 0. 0 is `the value
stored in the left operand'. Thus the value of the assignment is 0. 0 is a
false value, so if(i=foo()) { bar(); } will not call bar. What part of this
are you not getting?

gcc knows that mistyping = for == is a common mistake. It tries to guess when
you have made that mistake, and warns you about it. But the extra parentheses
do not make the code correct when it wasn't before. They are only a hint to
gcc that you don't want to see the warning. The actual meaning of the code is
unchanged.
