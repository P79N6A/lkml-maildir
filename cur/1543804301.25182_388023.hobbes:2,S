Now, putting on my "community hat" - we gave enough notice about the
removal. Few major distro releases happend after that. So, I am not
really going to complain - if it goes away.
But again, its really useful to have raw driver to do simple "dd" tests
to test raw performance for disks (for comparing with filesystems, block
devices etc..). Without that, we need to add option to "dd" for
O_DIRECT.
Thanks,
