Please don't. Write up the kernel modules and what hooks they provide as
source and distribute as such, and then rely on that for your regular,
binary-only, product. Doing otherwise forces people to stay with a broken
kernel because that is the only one that works sanely with your stuff. The
internal interfaces in the kernel change quite rapidly, even during a
stable series.
And please don't post HTML to mailing lists. It is considered extremely
rude by some.
