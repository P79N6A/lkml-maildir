I see loads of these, in a firewall (state matching) and SNAT setup.
When I send mail, I see them quite regularly.  It is quite annoying,
since they get dumped to the active text-mode console, in addition to
being logged.
Looking at the code a while back, quite a few of the netfilter
printk()'s did not have a log-level setting. Was this omitted
intentionally ? (Just checked 2.4.0-test9-pre4, it hasn't changed).
