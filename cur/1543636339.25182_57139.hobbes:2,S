Hi Folks,
As an old dump user (dumpster?) I have to admit that we've
avoided ext3 and Reiserfs because of this issue.  We couldn't
live without the "Tower of Hanoi".
I remember using, many years ago (SunOS 3.4), a patched
dump binary that allowed safe dumps from live UFS filesystems.
I don't remember all the details (it was 16-years ago) but
this dump would compare somehow, files before and after writing
to tape.  If there was a difference it would back out the
dumped file and preserve the consistency of the tape.  I don't
remember if it would go back and try the file again.
I haven't the foggest notion if this would work in these
modern times, I'm just offering it as food for thought.
Regards,
Lew Wolfgang
