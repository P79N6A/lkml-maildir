These are the DEVID right?  IO Port 0xfe and 0xff.  If so, then the kernel
should be identifying those chips already as Cyrix SLC (even if IBM made
them).  If this isn't happening then there's a bug.  Also remember that
some older SLC's didn't have the DEVID's, but still they should be
detected thru the 5/2 flag test.
