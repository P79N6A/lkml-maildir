Subject: [PATCH] cs46xx deadlocks in non-blocking read
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/1/1/57

Without this patch, the cs46xx driver in 2.4-prelease (well, in
-test12, at least) will hang the machine as soon as someone tries to
read from it in non-blocking mode.
The cs_read() function already removes the wait queue on exit, so it's
basically a correctness fix.
I've already sent this to Nils/Thomas but since it hasn't materialized
in prerelease or ac1, and since it's quite small and needed for a
number of things to function correctly, I'm sending it again in the
hopes that it will get applied before 2.4 final.
Cheers
