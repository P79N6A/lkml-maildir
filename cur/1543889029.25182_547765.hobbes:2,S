I've talked to an ATI engineer about VBIOS initialization. The chips
may have different steppings. They flash the right VBIOS that matches
the chip into the ROM on the card.  Given all the various steppings
this is the only sane way to initialize the hardware. I don't believe
generic initialization code that can handle all of the various
steppings exists for any hardware.
