Yes, I know that.  But you had a theory that depended on flush and other 
than the flush at the header/data boundary I don't see one until we are
done and fclose() the file.  So if you were counting on 3 fflush() calls
I don't think that is happening (an ltrace would tell us, tell me if you
want to know for sure and I'll check).

OK.
