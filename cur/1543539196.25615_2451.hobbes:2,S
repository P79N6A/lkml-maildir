   Just to give people some ideas regarding it..
   - VMS as had several defragmenter programs running in parallel
     with live system at least as early as 1986.
   - Doing orderly locking of critical datablocks might solve the issue;
     "just" some supporting IOCTLs so that suitably privileged process
     can do inode/superblock/bitmap-block/whatnot read/modify/write
     operations within the filesystem.
   - Doing those lockings via a fd (e.g. root directory fd of the
     mounted filesystem) would allow file closing (program crash,
     or whatever reason) to clean up afterwards.
