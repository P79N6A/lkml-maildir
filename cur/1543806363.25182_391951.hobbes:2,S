All --
I noticed the w83791d chip is supported in 2.9.2 of lm_sensors (in
.../chips/w83781d.c) but that it isn't supported in the 2.6 kernel
(.../drivers/hw_mon/w83781d.c).
Does anyone know why? From what I can see in the lm_sensor's archive,
the support was added to lm_sensors around may of 2003.
Is there any interest in having support for the w83791d in the kernel driver?
