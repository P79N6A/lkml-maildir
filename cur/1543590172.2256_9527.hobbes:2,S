Hi Anders - 
There is a bunch of code for Linux CANbus/DeviceNet drivers for SST
cards (sstech.on.ca) here:
http://home.att.net/~marksu/dn5136man.html
"This is a Linux driver and library of useful functions and utility
applications for the SST 5136-DN family of CAN bus/DeviceNet interface
boards."
SST makes these cards in various formats, pcmcia, PC104, isa...
Also found something here, not familiar with it though:

Good luck,
-Eric
