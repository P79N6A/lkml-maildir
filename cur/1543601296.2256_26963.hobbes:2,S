keventd is not suitable for RCU at all. It can get starved out by RT
threads and that can result in either memory pressure or performance
degradation depending on how RCU is being used.
I have a patch that uses a per-cpu quiescent state counter. Cost of 
this on schedule() path is one per-cpu counter increment. I will
mail out the patch as soon as I can complete testing Andrea's review
comments on a bigger SMP box.
Most impartantly :-) it doesn't use kernel threads.
Thanks
