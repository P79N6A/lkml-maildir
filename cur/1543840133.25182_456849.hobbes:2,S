What are the advantages at the syscall level (i.e., copy_user, 
format parsing) compared to a 16-entry byte array?
We are passing that uuid into a struct:
struct pfarg_ctx {
        __u8		ctx_smpl_buf_id[16];
        __u32		ctx_flags;
        __s32           ctx_fd;
        __u64           ctx_smpl_buf_size;
        __u64           ctx_reserved3[12];
};
