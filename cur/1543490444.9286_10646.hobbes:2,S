hi,
I'm using kernel 2.2.3 and when I try to smbmount a shared
directory from a win95 machine I get an error message like this:
--
[root@router /mnt]# smbmount //S5/CBO 1 -c router
Password:
SMBFS: need mount version 6
mount error: Invalid argument
Please look at smbmount's manual page for possible reasons
--
could someone explain me why is this happening?
what is with this sixth version of mount?
with kernel 2.0.36 I did not have any problem
I use smbfs 2.0.1-4
thanks in advance,
regards,
Claudiu Bosioc
