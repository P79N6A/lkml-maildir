ok so the obvious meta-question is this: what does it mean that your
test takes longer or shorter. I can see IO "capacity" (trying to avoid
the use bandwidth here) moves from the foreground test to the
background test (and/or other way around)... but if that was starved
previously... it could or could not be the right result.
What do you think the measure of "it's at least not worse" is? Is there
any way to get to that concept? (and then looking at if that got met is
the second step ;( )
