On that note, I'd really like to see better binary availability of cross 
compilers. While it's improved over the last few years mostly due to the 
crossgcc stuff it's still a pain. Ideally, they would be available through 
the distribution package manager even but failing that some dedicated place 
on kernel.org with x86->lots and some of the more widely used other 
combinations would quite definitely be good. Perhaps not really directly 
relevant to this thread as such, but still good.
Andrew maintain{s,ed} a number of them at
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/cross-compilers/
But as you see, most of the stuff there is really old again...
