Well, it wasn't meant to be. I imagine RMS would make the same type of
statement -- Linux is libre, therefore superior. There's a number of
OSes that have advantages of Linux in some area; Solaris can use more
processors; QNX is real-time, smaller and still posix; Windows has
better application support (i.e., more of them); MacOS has better color
and font management. But, Linux is free. Let's say for a moment that
Linux was exactly the same as Solaris, technically. Linux would be
superior because it is licensed under the GPL, and is free; whereas
Solaris would not be.
