Your dmesg log doesn't mention any MP-table. With neither ACPI MADT
nor an MP-table the kernel has no way of knowing about any I/O-APIC.
You do have UP_IOAPIC enabled, so the kernel should look for it.
Please check your BIOS settings, and try with no ACPI at all in the kernel
(just to verify that acpi=off doesn't prevent MP-table parsing).
