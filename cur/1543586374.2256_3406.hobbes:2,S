Hello
I'm using 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, sometimes after cron jobs like slocate process
or checking md5sum on my file system(heavy load disk), i gets errors from
the kernel:
EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,3)): ext2_free_blocks: bit already cleared for
block
80275
EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,3)): ext2_free_blocks: bit already cleared for
block
80275
EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,3)): ext2_free_blocks: bit already cleared for
block
80275
[...]
This problems occurs on THREE machines (with heavy load disks) with
kernel 2.4.2[3] and I dont't  think that is a problems with disks or RAM.
Any idea?
