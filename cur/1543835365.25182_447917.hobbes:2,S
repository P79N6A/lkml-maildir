Yes.  I should have said "the first present CPU" instead of "CPU0".

Yes.
First, the arch-dependent suspend code assumes implicitly that it will be
running on the BSP, so some strange things may happen if it doesn't.
Second, we have to make sure that this function will always leaves the
same CPU online.  It's a bit difficult to explain, but I'll do my best.
Suppose that disable_nonboot_cpus() exits running on CPU1, assuming it's
possible.  Then the system memory state saved in the suspend image will
reflect this situation.  Now the resume code will almost certainly run on the
BSP (say it's CPU0), but when the system memory is restored from the suspend
image the kernel will think it's running on CPU1.
In the last patch I send yesterday I made disable_nonboot_cpus() check if the
first present CPU, first_cpu(cpu_present_map), is online, try to bring it up
if not and migrate itself to it before the loop over all online CPUs is run.
I think that's general enough.
