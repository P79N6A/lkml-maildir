You would normally maintain a pool then because you'd expect an uneven
loading and groups of requests to a given id. The number of scripts
shouldn't matter for a properly designed interpreter - you have a fastcgi
interpreter instance or similar which has the interpreter state ready and
just forks itself to handle the scripts (or does them threaded itself) for
that user.
