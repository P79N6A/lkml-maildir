From net/tipc/bcast.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
int tipc_bcbearer_send(struct sk_buff *buf,
                       struct tipc_bearer *unused1,
                       struct tipc_media_addr *unused2)
{
        static int send_count = 0;
        struct node_map remains;
        struct node_map remains_new;
...
<--  snip  -->
You've just allocated 2*516 Bytes for the two structs from a stack that 
might only be 4 kB altogether.
