I don't see any reason to connect it with the notion of a node.
The main points of contention would appear to be cooperative vs.
forcible (where I believe cooperative is acknowledged as the only
feasible problem), and the potential connections with ZONE_HIGHMEM
wrt. constraints that would artificially introduce to 64-bit kernels.
The fact some systems would want to do whole nodes at a time with
some cpus and io buses in tandem is largely immaterial and doesn't
simplify, complicate, or otherwise affect the VM mechanics.
