atomic.h : standardizing atomic primitives
It mainly adds support for missing 64 bits cmpxchg and 64 bits atomic add
unless. Therefore, principally 64 bits architectures are targeted by these
patches. It also adds the complete list of atomic operations on the atomic_long
type.
These patches apply on 2.6.20-rc4-git3.
