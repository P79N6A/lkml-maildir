OK. Here's the info on my hdds. The older primary uses (according to the bootup
messages) UDMA 2. The newer one which won't use dma under Linux claims to use UDMA 4
at boot up (by boot messages I mean the ones from the bios *not* the kernel).
OK. Here's the output of hdparm -iv for the drives:
6.4Gb PRIMARY - USES UDMA successfully:
[root@periscope mastersj]# hdparm -iv /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  1 (on)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)

 IORDY=yes, tPIO={min:240,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4
10.8Gb SECONDARY WON'T USE UDMA UNDER LINUX (fails with resets and lots of errors):
[root@periscope mastersj]# hdparm -iv /dev/hdb
/dev/hdb:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  1 (on)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 1313/255/63, sectors = 21095424, start = 0
 Model=FUJITSU MPD3108AT, FwRev=DD-03-44, SerialNo=01029114
 Config={ HardSect NotMFM HdSw>15uSec Fixed DTR>10Mbs }
 RawCHS=20928/16/63, TrkSize=0, SectSize=0, ECCbytes=4
 BuffType=0(?), BuffSize=512kB, MaxMultSect=16, MultSect=off
 DblWordIO=no, maxPIO=2(fast), DMA=yes, maxDMA=0(slow)
 CurCHS=1313/255/63, CurSects=-469761727, LBA=yes, LBAsects=21095424
 tDMA={min:120,rec:120}, DMA modes: mword0 mword1 mword2
 IORDY=yes, tPIO={min:120,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4
The SMART STATUS of both devices indicates that they are functioning "perfectly" (or
at least aren't going to fail anytime "soon").
Thanx guys,
                    BIG JM.
