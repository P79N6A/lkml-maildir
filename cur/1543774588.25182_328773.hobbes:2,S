The needless probe cases patch went into -mm already. Also your change
doesn't eliminate the need for noprobe in cases where its not the first
or second interface in order.
The assumption most x86 users will only have two IDE interfaces is also
generally wrong today, although they may fall under the SATA driver on
newer boards.
I don't think this patch should go in - the one real reason for having
it in embedded boxes was saving memory. The right fix for that is
already something Bartlomiej has talked about fixing - the static
allocation of the ide_hwifs array itself.
