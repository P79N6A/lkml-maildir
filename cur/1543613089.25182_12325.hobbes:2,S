   I'm looking for information on knfsd's requirement that a filesystem be
   FS_REQUIRES_DEV in order to export it. Would someone point me in the right
   direction?
   Needing to implement some not-quite-kosher exports,
NFSD puts dev/ino into the filehandles it gives to the
client, it uses this to lookup the inode in question.
