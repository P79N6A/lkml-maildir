Current users already do the serialize the calls into hrtimer themselves 
(stopping and restarting), which can make the locking even simpler.

For example dynamically attaching a timer_base to a clock source (e.g. to 
create a monotonic timer independent of NTP adjustments). Right now as 
soon as any timer_base is active it cannot be deconfigured again due to 
pointers to it from timers, so this would require different locking.
