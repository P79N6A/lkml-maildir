I can't find the definition of pcihpfs_fs_type used in 
pci_hotplug_core.c in register_filesystem(), unregister_filesystem(),
and kern_mount().  This is causing a compilation error.
PS - I don't use this in my kernel, so I can disable it from my
config without penalty.  But seeing as I don't see any posts
about this on LKML, should I try to build kernels with everything
enabled in the future (just to get these small errors stomped out
quickly)?
