If needed, there's already a "system_running" flag used to ignore the 
underlying usermode helper execution if requested prior to the system 
being ready for such an event at boot time, and perhaps this could be 
co-opted or extended for use at suspend/resume time.  Sounds like the 
correct behavior is to leave the exec requests queued until userspace is 
resumed (and I'd assume that device power state notifications are not 
needed, but perhaps hotplug events and/or modprobes of drivers for 
hotpluggable devices and associated features may be generated at resume 
time).  Thanks,
