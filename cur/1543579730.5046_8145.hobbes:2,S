Hi All,
While trying to determine why my SCSI Ultra 160 drives don't work on my Dell 
PowerApp.Web 100 I noticed this section of code:
      /*
       * This is needed to work around a sequencer bug for now.  Regardless
       * of the controller in use, if we have a Quantum drive, we need to
       * limit the speed to 80MByte/sec.  As soon as I get a fixed version
       * of the sequencer, this code will get yanked.
       */
      if(!strncmp(buffer + 8, "QUANTUM", 7) &&
         p->transinfo[tindex].goal_options )
Since this machine has Quantum drives I guess this is my problem.  Does anyone 
know if this code is still actually neccessary?  It seems it's been there a 
while.  It's dissapointing to not get full performance out of the hardware you 
have.
Thanks,
Tom
