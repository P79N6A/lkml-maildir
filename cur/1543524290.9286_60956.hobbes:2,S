i am grateful for what i get.  the egcs project has given my floating
point simulation stuff about 20-30% faster run times as compared to
2.7.2.3.  this helps a lot when a run can last a week or more.

the original topic which spurred this discussion was wanting to yank
-fno-strength-reduce from the kernel build flags.  allowing strength
reduction (which, if i understand correctly, is a dubious optimization
on x86 due to the dearth of registers) would not be wise as long as
the latest gcc release suffers from bugs in the strength reduction
department.  
the other solution to the bug is to just keep using
-fno-strenght-reduce until such time as the current gcc with a fixed
strength reducer becomes available.
