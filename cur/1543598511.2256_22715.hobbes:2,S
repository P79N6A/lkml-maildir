Ehm, isn't the firmware only cleared to zero in the runtime memory or
are you saying that they nuke their flash ram as well? If the flash
ram is safe, you should still be able to boot any kernel and go from
there after you reset the adapter.
Clearing the firmware is still utterly stupid, but thats a firmware
stupidity. It is actually possibly to find the binary firmware image
out in the flash, but it's located at a weird location that makes me
suspect that they have some directory structure which I do not know
about.

Well I thought Linus said we were going to have a required init
ramdisk for 2.5 anyway. But thats of course an unknown amount of time
away.

I disagree, the driver will still work just fine for people who have
the cards in machines such as PCs. I do agree however that it would
probably have been a good idea to leave a note in there stating why it
was removed.
However the reason I barked was because of you suggesting we remove
all firmware or should just have left it in there. If we have a GPL
violation then IMHO it has to be dealt with immediately, then we can
look at the damages afterwards.
