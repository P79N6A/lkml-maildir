OK, how about some hardware scenarios:
I've a scsi array (an LSI 6298) which has no WWN page (0x83) but does have a 
serial number in the VPD page.  However, the VPD serial number is an 
identifier for the array *controller* and thus is the *same* for all the LUNs. 
 For this beast I have to add in the LUN number to the VPD serial number to 
get a unique identifier per device.  Worse, the LSI 6298 is multi path.  Now I 
get a different "unique" identifier depending on path (because different 
controllers give different VPD serial numbers), so if I want to identify it 
uniquely, I have to use some property of the LUN, like partion UUID.
Or, what about an old 8 bit EMC symmetrix.  They have no WWN page and they 
embed both a LUN and a *path* identifier in the VPD serial number.  To get the 
globally unique ID for this one, I have to strip off the path part.

Ah, but that's the scsi-3 spec which (finally) cleaned up this unique name 
business.  However, for SCSI-2 and before, it was an unholy mess, as the two 
examples above illustrate.  I agree that for all modern devices which are 
SCSI-3 SPC compliant, then just asking for the WWN page probably works.  The 
question is what to do about all the legacy hardware out there?
