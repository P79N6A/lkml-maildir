Thanks a lot, works here too (only tried on serial console).
By the way, Ivan, do you have problems with gcc 4 on alpha ?
All kernels I tried between 2.6.11 and 2.6.13 with Debian gcc-4.0.1-2
have a strange bug that does not appear with gcc 3.3 and 3.4
(non-root ssh sessions are immediately closed).
