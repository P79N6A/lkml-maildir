And what on earth makes this better?  I have always thought the socket
interface to be hideously ugly and full of ad-hockery.  Its abstractions
for handle multiple address families by and large don't work, and it
introduces new system calls left, right and center -- sometimes for good
reasons, but please do tell me why I can't open() an AF_UNIX socket, but
have to use a special system call called connect() instead.
