     Indeed.  Here in the state of Oregon (USA) we currently have some
rather draconian computer crime laws which basically state that if you
change a bit on a computer you don't own and the owner didn't specifically
give you permission to change that bit then you just committed a crime.
Fortunately most "crimes" in this category don't get reported; otherwise
we'd all be in jail.  But until places like Oregon get a clue it's not a
good idea to piss off anybody you don't trust.
