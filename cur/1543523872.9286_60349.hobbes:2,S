twice now while 2.3.41-4 was doing fsck's during bootup 
I have received the message
  hda: lost interrupt
I've never seen this before, and this hardware hasn't changed
 (that I know of :-)
After rebooting back to 2.3.40 the problem went away.
 (hadn't seen any mention of this recently so I thought I'd ask)
( I had been running 2.3.41-4 overnight with no problem )
