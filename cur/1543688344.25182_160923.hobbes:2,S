I can easily see that the data might be divided into two separate pages
and between updating those pages, another process would have read the
first page, but not the second page. That would result in a mixed old
and new data. Probably just <old><new> or <new><old> instead of
<new><old><new> what I was worrying about, but still it would be nicer
to rely only on byte atomicity and read/write ordering. :)

There are of multiple writers, but it's fine for them to do locking
between each others.
