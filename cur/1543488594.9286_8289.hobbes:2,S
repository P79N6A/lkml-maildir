No, that's not a fair comparison. Paging/swapping is the only way to
extend virtual memory space without buying more RAM. Is there an
alternative method of increasing VM size without paging, and is it any
faster?
Also, typical programmes don't suffer much performance loss with
paging.
DSM is not the only solution to parallel/distributed computing. DSM
can destroy performance for typical threaded programmes. Typical MPI
programmes will work fairly well on a cluster.
