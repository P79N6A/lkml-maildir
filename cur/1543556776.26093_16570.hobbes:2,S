there was an issue with floppy ioctls and permission checks in block
device ->open routine recently. Just use test12-pre7 or other sufficiently
recent kernel and it will work.
If you _do_ want to know what's going on -- look for the thread where I
reported that floppies can't me mounted readonly, then AV proposed the
fix, then it turned out that Alain Knaff forgot to put his name in the
MAINTAINERS file so we didn't tell him about the fix and it apparently
broke some userspace tools. Later on, it was fixed in a way that makes
everyone happy.

Tigran
