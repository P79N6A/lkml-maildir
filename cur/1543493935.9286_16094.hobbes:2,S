2.2 seems to make better use of the available free memory, but it uses
up more non-swappable memory for internal use.  It depends on the
workload which effect will dominate, but if you really really need
the most possible free physical memory then 2.0 will likely be better.
Note that even on 4MB 2.2 may well be faster since it is so much more
efficient at paging and swapping (I've had reports of 2.2 being 300% or
more faster than 2.0.36 on 4MB boxes).
