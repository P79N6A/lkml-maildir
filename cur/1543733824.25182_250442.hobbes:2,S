Yes, I think this is the way we want to go.  Here are the "rubs" I see:
a.) resolution.  If you don't put a limit on this you will invite timer storms. 
  Currently, by useing 1/HZ resolution, all timer "line up" on ticks and reduce 
the interrupt overhead that would occure if we actually tried to give "exactly" 
what was asked for.  This is a matter of math and can be handled (assuming we 
resist the urge to go shopping :))
b.) For those platforms with repeating timers that can not "hit" our desired 
resolution (i.e. 1/HZ) there is an additional overhead to program the timer each 
interrupt.   In principle we do this in the HRT patch, but there we only do it 
for high resolution timers, which we assume are rather rare.  It is good to have 
a low res timer that is also accurate.  Even better if we can keep the overhead 
low by not having to reprogram a timer each tick.
In the ideal world we would have a hardware repeating timer that is reasonably 
accurate (we might want to correct it every second or so) to generate the low 
res timing interrupts and a high res timer that we can program quickly for high 
resolution interrupts.
