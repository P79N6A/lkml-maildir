Subject: [BUG] 2.6.0-test3 and cciss driver (or blk_queue_hardsect_size)

I'm wondering if anyone else is having problems with 2.6.0-test3 and the
cciss driver, or with the function blk_queue_hardsect_size.  I was able to
successfully boot 2.6.0-test2 in previous weeks, but trying 2.6.0-test3
today gave me:

I haven't seen any traffic today on LKML about problems with cciss or
blk_queue_hardsect_size.  I'll start debugging myself, but if this looks
obvious to someone, let me know.
The system in question is a 4 CPU XEON 1.9 GHz machine w/ 2 GB ram.  Two
drives are attached to the cciss as a mirrored pair (RAID 1).
