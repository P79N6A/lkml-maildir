Well, that's my point.  This kind of stuff works great until you
start to really push it.

Yup.  And that's only the beginning.  I bet the perfmon support would
introduce even more interesting ordering constraints.

Basically, you're proving my point.  Ornaments look like a generic
facility, yet there are global dependencies (ordering, locking, ...)
which require each use to be checked against possibly all existing
ornament users.
