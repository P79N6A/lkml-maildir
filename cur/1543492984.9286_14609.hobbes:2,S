Two kinds of devices, /dev/vcsN and /dev/vcsaN exist for reading the contents
of Linux virtual consoles.  So if you have the ability to mount a writable
media and to mknod, just create /dev/vcsa1 and "cat /dev/vcsa1 > snapshot"
There should be a tool out there to convert the vcsa format to "ANSI"
graphics or a gif/png/whatever file , but I'm not sure of one offhand.
