Maybe the per-device limit is easy to implement, but otherwise it seems
arbitrary to me.  People usually do io on files, not devices.  So
a per-file limit seems better to me.  
The per-device limit is no good for the common case of having only
one device, and also fails with multiple devices when only one is
in use for a while.

I agree to that one, but I don't think the per-device thing will
do much good.  How about some hash function that groups the 
cached files, and limiting each group to 75% or so?  This will
work with one-disk machines too.
