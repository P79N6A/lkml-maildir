Eh? However big the caches are, you can still get misses which will
require multiple (blocking) disk accesses to handle...

Only for cache hits. If you're doing a Mindcraft benchmark or something
with everything in RAM, you're fine - for real world servers, that's not
really an option ;-)
Really, you want/need cache MISSES to be handled without blocking. However
big the caches, short of running EVERYTHING from a ramdisk, these will
still happen!
