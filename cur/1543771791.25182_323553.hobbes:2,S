Well, stictly since these sections are still under CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
in arch/x86_64/Kconfig. Evolving... ?

This has been around for ages.. even in ia64 code. For forking idle threads
we want to do them in clean state so we dont acquire state from threads
from where the cpu_up is being invoked. Hence we want them to start from
keventd() threads. But when system boot is happening, there is no keventd()
yet, hence we need to create them right away.
the other problem we ran into was ACPI code that handles physical cpu hotplug
also queues to keventd(), this becomes permanently blocking when called from
code already running in kevend().

I was actually trying to be consistent :-), rest of the debug code 
was under Dprintk() hence didnt want to use a new style. Not sure
what you need here exactly. Do you want to convert the rest of the code to 
not use Dprintk()? or just leave this with a printk? I dont have a 
particular preference here... i would rather leave it with Dprintk() as the
rest of the debug code.

I can remove.. when iam inside the file, iam used to search for fn;s from 
start of line.. no biggie.. can revert.
