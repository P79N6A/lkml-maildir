Hello,
I'm running devfs v1.22 on this Gentoo system:
Linux soma 2.6.3 #8 Thu Jun 10 00:17:31 EDT 2004 i686 Pentium III 
(Coppermine) GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
...and I just unplugged my USB memory-stick reader.  That apparently caused 
devfsd to go into "D" state (uninterruptible sleep, right?):
root       118  0.0  0.1  1832  924 ?        D    Aug27   0:01 /sbin/devfsd /dev
...and it won't come back.  CPU is idle, but load is:
load average: 52.90, 51.41, 49.48
...and now some weird stuff is happening, for example man doesn't work, and 
ps works but doesn't return.  (top works, vmstat works...)
killall -HUP devfsd doesn't do anything.
Is it possible to fix this without rebooting?
Thanks,
Anthony DiSante
