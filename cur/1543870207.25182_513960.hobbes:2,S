Did you hide all the complexity of the userspace atom decoding inside 
another function? :)
How much code would go away, in case we pick a simple/parallel 
sys_async_exec engine? Atoms decoding, special userspace variable access 
for loops, jumps/cond/... VM engine.

Wouldn't you agree on a simple/parallel execution engine like me and Linus 
are proposing (and threadlets, of course)?
