Don't these two flags invoke two different mechanisms.
  __GFP_NOFAIL can sleep for HZ/50 then retry, rather than return failure.
  __GFP_CRITICAL can steal from the emergency pool rather than fail.
I would favor renaming at least the __GFP_CRITICAL to something
like __GFP_EMERGPOOL, to highlight the relevant distinction.
