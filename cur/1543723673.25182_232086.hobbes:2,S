Hello,
to test the parameters of the sk98lin module I have a script, that stops the 
network, unloads and re-loads the module and starts the network again.
After executing the script dmesg shows this oops:
Badness in remove_proc_entry at fs/proc/generic.c:685
 [<c0107d19>] dump_stack+0x19/0x20
 [<c018c54f>] remove_proc_entry+0xbf/0x110
 [<f8a42fef>] skge_cleanup_module+0x19f/0x1a9 [sk98lin]
 [<c01360a2>] sys_delete_module+0x152/0x190
 [<c0106e57>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb
Fortunality everything still works fine (I'm running the script over the 
network of the syskonnect cards).
This machine has two of those syskonnect cards, on another machine which has 
only one syskonnect card this oops doesn't occur.
Thanks,
	Bernd
