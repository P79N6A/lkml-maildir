It should discard multiple presses of the same key in very rapid
succession, when that is immediately after the first press of that
key.  (After a time has passed, rapid successive presses are due to
auto-repeat, which is ok).
Several laptops seem to send a key down event 3, 5 or very many times
in response to a single press.
