Just to get this out of the way, I assume CONFIG_LBD is turned on?
I think so, otherwise it should not mount.
Also, is below an oops, or an xfs corruption message, or...?  What came
before the call trace.
fsck won't do anything, fsck.xfs is a no-op.
You could run xfs_repair over the fs to see what it finds.
Also please include xfs_info output for the filesystem, and whether you
expect that any clients are writing files > 4G...
And, that stack looks awfully long if it's real, turning on the stack
overflow check in the kernel might be interesting.
