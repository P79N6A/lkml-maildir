This was deliberate becasue sequence number generation could not be
slow for some workloads.  The sequence number attacks that MD4
protects against are tcp hijacking attacks where the attacker is on
the network path ---- if you really want security you'd be using real
crypto for encryption and for integrity protection at the application
layer.

The basic idea here is that you can mix in arbitrary amounts of zero
data without destroying the randomness of the pool.  This is
important, and was an explicit design goal.

Yawn.  Root has access to /dev/mem.  Your point?
