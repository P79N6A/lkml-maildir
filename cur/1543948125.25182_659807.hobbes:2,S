Yeah, sync_file_range has slightly unusual semantics and introduce
the new concept, "writeout", to userspace (does "writeout" include
"in drive cache"? the kernel doesn't think so, but the only way to
make sync_file_range "safe" is if you do consider it writeout).
If it makes it any easier to understand, we can add in
SYNC_FILE_ASYNC, SYNC_FILE_SYNC parts that just deal with
safe/unsafe and sync/async semantics that is part of the normal
POSIX api.
Anyway, the idea of making fsync/fdatasync etc. safe by default is
a good idea IMO, and is a bad bug that we don't do that :(
