Argh, I thought GregKH had sent for_each_pci_dev()
Wearing a brown paper bag, can one of you please "cset -x" this changeset?

   [PATCH] hw_random.c: replace pci_find_device
   As pci_find_device is going away I've replaced it with pci_get_device.
   for_each_pci_dev is a macro wrapper around pci_get_device.
   If someone with this hardware could test it I would appreciate it.
