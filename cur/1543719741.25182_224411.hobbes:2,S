Me too!
uClinux has an SMC9111 driver which I now use, but it would be good if
the base kernel worked (I _think_ that driver's the only reason it
doesn't on this platform).
[Hmmm, uClinux also contains patches to the SMC9194 driver; I wonder if
they should be merged?  Some of the changes seem kind of ugly though
(lots of platform-specific #ifdefs).]
