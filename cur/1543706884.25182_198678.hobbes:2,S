$ echo ide-scsi>/proc/ide/hdX/driver
or
$ echo "ide-scsi:1">/proc/ide/hdX/settings
or
use HDIO_SET_IDE_SCSI ioctl
and you can change driver from ide-{cd,floppy,tape} to ide-scsi in-fly.
You can also use it in reverse direction (ie. from ide-scsi to ide-cd).
What more crap do you need?  There is already one /proc setting too much.
