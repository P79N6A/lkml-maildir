Hi guys,
I have a question related to keyboard and hotkeys.
Does any standart exist for hotkeys and their returned events?
I have 2 keyboards with hotkeys, one on laptop (acerhk operated) and one 
wireless (BlueZ bthid operated) and both returns different codes in xev when 
same keys are pressed
mail
browser
etc.
Maybe these should be standardised in all drivers? Can we start same kind of 
list, where will be all events stored and then translated by all drivers the 
same?
Now users can't use one hotkeys configuration on different keyboards so these 
could be renamed to hellkeys :)
Your opinions?
Michal
