And while at it, please make it much more readable by writing it as
	time_adjust_step = time_adjust;
	if (time_adjust_step) {
		..
which is even less to type (no "!= 0", no extra parenthesis, just a 
";<nl><tab>", and you've saved a whopping three bytes of source code while 
making the end result more readable, and the compiler will generate the 
same thing.
Assignments inside tests should probably be relegated entirely to loop 
constructs, where doing them outside the test changes semantics.
