Hi Alan,
I also had this message twice on a very closed firewall environment :
- Pentium2-400 on QDI motherboard,
- no ide hardware neither driver
- one floppy drive in which the only diskette resides with kernel 2.2.14pre4
- three 3c905 cards loaded as one single module
- ipxd running
- ipchains active, without masquerading, but ip_always_defrag set.
- no framebuffers ; console is purely text.
- not even one listening UDP or TCP socket.
- little network load.
- not anything else.
Hoping this can help you,
Willy Tarreau
