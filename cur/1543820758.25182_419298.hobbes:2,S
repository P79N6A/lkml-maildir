Yes, but this will optimise away the check for known non-NULL.
At the cost of icache footprint.
I think unmeasurable micro-optimisations that go against historic
CPU trends (eg. size for speed) aren't worth wasting too much
sleep over. If it is a 0.0001% speedup today, it'll be a 0.0001%
slowdown tomorrow :)
