Yet being able to access another namespace via directory fd still breaks
that boundary.  I'm not sure if it's a feature or a not.  If it is a
feature, I'd argue that having the fd means you are trusted to play in
that namespace, which implies the right to do things like call mount(2)
in it.

Namespace sharing has been touched on before, but hasn't been discussed
publicly.  My take on it is that in order to have namespace sharing work
in some semantically sane way, we need to be able to identify
owner-namespaces for shared branches of the vfsmount tree.  This implies
making namespaces first-class primitives.  Is this where we want to go
with this?
I only see automounting being the only consumer of such a beast, are
there other possible users?
