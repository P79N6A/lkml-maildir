Yeah, makes sense, that's a bug trap to test if we guessed endianness 
right. Could you try to just comment out the call to traps() in main()?
The rest of the code should be safe. If commenting out fixes the problem, 
could you try to replace
-	char *test = "CONF";
+	static char __attribute__((aligned(8))) test[] = "CONF";
Thanks,
