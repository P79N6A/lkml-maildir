The errata is not PS/2 mouse specific:
it says that the io apic doesn't implement masking interrupts correctly.
Linux uses masking aggressively - disable_irq() is implemented by 
masking the interrupt in the io apic. I'm surprised that this doesn't 
cause frequent problems. Perhaps the problem only occurs if an invalid 
cpu id is written into the target register, as done by Netware?
Is someone around with a ne2k-pci card and a AMD-760MPX based system?
Regarding Jan's problem: I'm not sure if his problems are related to 
this errata. It says that using a PS/2 mouse instead of a serial mouse 
with Novell Netward avoids the hang during shutdown, probably because 
then netware doesn't mask the irq.
