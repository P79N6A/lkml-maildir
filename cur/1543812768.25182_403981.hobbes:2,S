The whole idea is to figure out what socket gets the packet
without going through the IP and TCP stack at all, in the
hardware interrupt handler, using a tiny classifier that's
very fast and can be implemented in hardware.
Please wrap your brain around the idea a little longer than
the 15 or so minutes you have thus far... thanks.

That's complete BS.
