Linux simply uses page->count for this. By using the page->count,
multiple parts of the kernel can pin the same page in memory at
different times and unlock them at different times without any
locking/unlocking conflicts...
page_cache_get(page);  <= increases page->count
<your critical stuff here>
page_cache_drop(page); <= removes your extra count
