Subject: [PATCH 0/6] UML - Six for 2.6.25
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/6/186

These patches are a mixed bag of performance improvements, small bug
fixes, and code cleanup.
They should wait for 2.6.25.
