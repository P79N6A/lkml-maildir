1.  "Nonexistent swap-page" messages and associated symptoms
2.  When booting my machine (with "loadlin"), the following boot message
    appears:

   (No power saving mode is enabled)
   Although I can subsequently access the system, when "reboot" is
   invoked the process goes no further than the line "Please stand by
   while restarting the system..."
   Thereafter, the system "hangs" and the only solution is to do a cold
   boot.
   If I boot Linux with my boot disk, these symptoms do not appear and
   everything appears to work as it should.
   "Loadlin" is installed on my C: drive, which runs Windows 95, and I
   access it via the "Command prompt only" option.
   I am using the SuSE-6.0 distribution, and SuSE Technical Support has told
   me that this is a "known unsolved kernel problem" which is "hardware
   related". 
   By booting the DOS/Windows system using the "step-by-step configuration"
   option, I have established that the problem is related to a line in the
   "autoexec.bat" file, which reads:
                           SET CTSYN=C:\WINDOWS
   This is part of the boot process for the machine's Soundblaster
   "Live! Value" sound card.  Bypassing this line ** seems ** to cure the
   boot message problem but, of course, probably produces another one with
   the sound card.
   I have found a number of "threads" on the subject of the "nonexistent swap-
   page" problem in "DejaNews", but no indication of how it can be resolved.
3. Keywords: "nonexistent swap-page", boot, reboot, loadlin
4. Kernel version:  /proc/version reads: "2.0.36 gcc-driver v egcs-2.91.60
                    1198 1201 (egcs-1.1.1 release) gcc v 2.7.2.3"
5. Output of Oops: none
6. -----
7. Environment
7.1  No ver_linux file found
7.2  Processor: /proc/cpuinfo reads:  cpu: 686 Pentium 2 
7.3  Module information: /proc/module shows nothing (though modules were
     configurd and installed)
7.4  SCSI information: no SCSI device fitted
7.5  See above
   I shall be most grateful if you can tell me:
a)  What is the cause of these problems
b)  Whether they have been resolved in the 2.2.x kernel and, if so, with
    effect from which patch number
c)  If not, what can be done to eliminate them?
I look forward to the pleasure of hearing from you.
With many thanks in advance,
