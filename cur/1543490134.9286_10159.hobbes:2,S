Although many people might cry no!, it certainly is a good idea. I have
seen a bank strugling with a closed "unix"-like proprietery box, only
talking netbeui. To unclose such a box needs at least windows. So any work
for netbeui would certainly not be a waste of time. I'm also thinking
about a lot of os/2 lanman systems that talk netbeui. It unfortanetely is
not a protocol that we can dismiss like a bad joke. I would have hoped
that someone already saw the "light" and that netbeui support already was
there.
