Hi Michael,
The National University of Singapore has an implementation of Mobile IP in
the 2.0.34 Linux kernel. (Released under the GPL License)
More details can be obtained from 
http://mip.ee.nus.edu.sg
 or 
http://skylark.ee.nus.edu.sg
The web site contains links to other Linux Mobile IP implementations too.
(eg Dynamics HUT have an MIP implementation for the 2.2 kernels)
The NUS Mobile IP project is eagerly looking for developers interested in
further improving the source codes that we have released. Do drop me a
note if anyone is interested in participating in the NUS Mobile IP  project.
Many thanks and Hope this helps,
Foo Chun Choong,
The NUS Mobile IP Project,
National University of Singapore
