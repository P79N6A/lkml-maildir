just minutes before starting to pack my barebone to send it to service, 
it seems that I solved the issue with the USB stick by patching the 
ehci-hub.c file.
Actually, the messages in the log file
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.2: port 6 reset error -110
showed that I had a timeout problem (110=ETIMEOUT). I found a call to a 
function "handshake" in ehci-hub.c which set the timeout to 500µs.
Increasing this timeout to 600µs allows the onboard hub to complete the 
reset. The stick is correctly mounted afterwards. (I tried 550, but this 
was still not enough.)
Any chance to have this included in future patches and versions? I guess 
there could be other people around with such a problem. The increase of 
the timeout should not hurt too much, should it?
