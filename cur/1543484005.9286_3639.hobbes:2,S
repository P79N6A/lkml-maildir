1) what if you only want to recieve but dont want to send? (routes are for
   send not recieve, think one way cable modem)
2) Actually, that would be bad (ifconfig,then chains). Luckly ipchains
   allows you to firewall before it's up.
This is really more an issue for Dial on demand links, where the implicit
routing makes things much more complicated.
