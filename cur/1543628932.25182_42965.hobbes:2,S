Right! But is not a configuration file (in /etc/, like the original sources
and RH). So it should be in /usr/lib (or in /usr/include, it is really a C/C++
file, but now we don't use it as a C file).
Anyway, I will no change the location [1]. The file is a nearly a C file, so
no problems with other archs. I see it as the man pages of lilo, and other
arch specific program. They are in /usr/share, readable by all arch,
but not so usefull on other arch.

PS: Do you maintain the RH kernel-utils ?
