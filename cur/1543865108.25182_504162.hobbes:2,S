However, I am not sure how the kernel will handle this. Especially since:
  * if you boot with no initramfs, init= is handled by your script
    (otherwise: kernel)
  * does "init" qualify as a kernel param already? I don't think so,
    since the code indicates to be wanting "init=" at least.
Either way, the word "init" in the above doc is either (1) wrong
or (2) superfluous [unless something strange happens to interpret it later,
which I don't think]
