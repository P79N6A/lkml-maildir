I have a bad feeling about this, so I'll make the following comments
up front before all the reports start rolling in.  It may be a good
idea to document this somewhere.  (Coding style?)
If a header has something like these:
struct my_headers_struct {
	struct task_struct *tsk;
};
void my_function(struct task_struct *tsk);
and gcc warns that "struct task_struct" has not been declared, please
don't think about adding another header.  Just declare the structure
in the header file which needs it like this:
struct task_struct;
and that will prevent the #include maze of 2.4, which resulted in
everything being rebuilt just because one header file was touched.
