That would work unless someone actually cares about 386 or 486 in the
embedded space.  I think at least 486EX is still used as an embedded
platform.
The kernel can obviously provide this service (although it slows down
the #UD handler), but anyone who actually cares about these chips would
not really want them.
At some point, we may want to ask ourselves how long keeping 386 support
(with it's broken WP handling) alive.
