You need an updated driver with 2.5 support:
        
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/index.html
(There is no GPM support yet unfortunately.) Boot without the
psmouse_noext option. Use something like this in your XF86Config file.
        Section "InputDevice"
                Identifier      "TouchPad"
                Driver  "synaptics"
                Option  "Device"        "/dev/input/event3"
                Option  "Protocol"      "event"
                Option  "MinSpeed"      "0.08"
                Option  "MaxSpeed"      "0.10"
                Option  "AccelFactor"   "0.0010"
                Option  "SHMConfig"     "on"
        EndSection
Note that you need to replace the "3" with the correct number for your
hardware setup.
Vojtech. Is it possible to figure out automatically from user space
which eventX device is connected to the touchpad? It's not very user
friendly to have to figure out this number manually, and it's quite
annoying that you get a different number if a USB mouse is connected
to the computer.
