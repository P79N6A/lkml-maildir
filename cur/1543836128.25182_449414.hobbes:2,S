Right.

Yep.

OK, lets step back a bit... sysctl(8) can be used to load other values, or
to change them, etc. Whatever is in sysctl.conf is just /default/ values,
/typically/ set on boot. You could let the initscripts set those, then
fiddle them by hand. If a module is now inserted, you can't just reset the
values to the ones in the file.
Perhaps module-specific values should be set in the configuration for the
module itself (i.e., arguments) or add to modprobe.conf something along
the lines:
  sysctl mymod kernel.mystuff=42
and have modprobe(8) run sysctl(8) as needed after loading the module? 
Sounds more KISSy to me...
