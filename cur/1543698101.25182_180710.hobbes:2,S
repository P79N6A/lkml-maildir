Been sorting some bugs out. Its pretty stable. Although CONFIG_SMT
is still apparently broken. It will probably stay that way due to not
having an SMP P4 to test with and being a bit busy with other things.
I have done some tweaking of the "domains", and found some pretty
impressive performance improvements. The 16-way NUMAQ at OSDL is
running out of steam now (ie. I've got quite a bit of low hanging
fruit), and I've only got a couple more days with it anyway. So I'd
like other architectures especially to try it if interested.
I could assist in building architecture specific scheduling descriptions
if anyone would like to try it on a non traditional SMP / NUMA, however
I think something might be broken with SMT handling. Probably active
migration. I can't be bothered fixing it unless I can find an SMP P4 HT
to test with :P
(dbench is most significantly improved)
System is dev16-000 at OSDL. total/idle ticks are profiler ticks.
