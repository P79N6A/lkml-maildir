The term "block" is ambiguous here.  I assume your use of the word is a
unit of encryption (usually 64 bits).  Otherwise we would have to pass the
entire filesystem to derive the IV, and that would be much too expensive.
Your argument depends on the degree of entropy in the plain text.  IV's
must never be duplicated.  Many disk blocks in a filesystem can and do
contain identical plain text and therefore would hash to identical IVs,
and would thus encrypt to identical ciphertext.  Absolute disk block 
numbers (on the same disk) can never be duplicated.  That's why I chose 
to use them.
