I did a bit of testing on a 256MB laptop with a fairly slow disk, ext3. 
Three iterations of the test took:
2.6.6:		1055.53s user 327.14s system 32% cpu 1:10:06.71 total
2.4.27-pre2:	1042.03s user 307.21s system 32% cpu 1:09:46.00 total
2.6.3:		1053.23s user 326.16s system 27% cpu 1:22:07.24 total
So there's nothing particularly wild there.  It's possible I guess that the
2.6 VM is very sucky but something else made up for it - possibly the
anticipatory scheduler but more likely the Orlov allocator.
You're using reiserfs, yes?
Are you sure the IDE disks are in DMA mode?
