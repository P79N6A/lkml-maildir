Yes.

Not necessarily. It says it_interval is a "reload value", it's used to 
reload the timer to count down to the next expiration.
It's up to the implementation, whether it really counts down this time or 
whether it converts it first into an absolute value.

If the result is relative, why should have a clock set any effect?
IMO the spec makes it quite clear that initial timer and the periodic 
timer are two different types of the timer. The initial timer only 
specifies how the periodic timer is started and the periodic timer itself 
is a "relative time service".
