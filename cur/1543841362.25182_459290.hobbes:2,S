I thought the code was still officially *new*.
As I understood things from what you said, you delegated responsibility for my
patches on to Trond, who hasn't taken them yet.  He has further delegated
review responsibility on to Christoph, so I've been consolidating my patches
to make it easier for Christoph (or whoever) to do so.
So, as I understand the situation, my patches won't go anywhere until
Christoph ACKs them and Trond takes them into his tree.  If this isn't so,
please clarify the situation.
