On ia64 the percpu area is at 0xffffffffffff0000 so that it can be
addressed without tying up another register (all percpu addresses
are small negative offsets from "r0").  When David Mosberger
chose this address he said that gcc 4 would actually make
ue of this, but I haven't checked the generated code to see
whether it really is doing so.
