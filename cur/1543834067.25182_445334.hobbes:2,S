I suspect you had some residual directory corruption from using the
2.6.17 XFS (which is known to have a lurking dir2 corruption issue,
fixed in the latest -stable point release).

2.6.18-rc1 should be fine (contains the corruption fix).  Did you
mkfs and restore?  Or at least get a full repair run?  If you did,
and you still see issues in .18-rc1, please let me know asap.
thanks.
