Why?
ptrace() is a system call
fork() is a system call
write() is a system call
other arch's performance counter interfaces are system calls

There are about half a dozen operations, not 65. I could use 6 system calls,
no problem, but as long as Linus is silent about this I have no reason to
change it speculatively in random directions.
