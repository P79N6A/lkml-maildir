Hello All,
Last week we proposed to add couple of IOCTLs to scan/remove the LDs.
It was suggested on the list that our application go sysfs route instead.
We are taking that route. (Matt Domsh, Christoph, JBG and Brian King - 
thanks for your feedback! It is appreciated.)
Please review our updated proposal. Considering that our application can 
add and remove drives on the fly:
Adding a drive:- For application to use sysfs to scan newly added drive,
it needs to know the HCTL (SCSI address - Host, Channel, Target & Lun)
of the drive. Driver is the only one that knows the mapping between a 
drive and the corresponding HCTL.
Removing a drive:- There is no sane way for the application to map out
drives to /dev/sd<x>. If application has a way of knowing the HCTL of a
deleted drive, then using that HCTL, it can match the corresponding SCSI
device name (/dev/sd<x>) and use sysfs to remove that drive.
To this end, we are requesting to be allowed to add a small IOCTL to the
driver that returns the HCTL for an LD. Our strong case is really the
"Adding
a drive" case. Somebody may suggest that an application can blindly
scan all channels and all targets on a host when it adds one drive. That
would
_not_ be correct thing to do. Application should ideally scan only the
drives that 
it has added.
I am attaching and inlining the patch that implements this logic.
Thank you,
Sreenivas
