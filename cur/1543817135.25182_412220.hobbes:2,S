Excellent.

Well that, to me, is _the_ hard problem to solve for this. But you
sort-of do know, my plan is/was to add a ->steal() hook to the pipe
buffers that would 'unhook' the page so it was in a clean state to be
added to the LRU/page cache again. If stealing failed, just fall back to
copying (or hard error, let the flags decide).

You are more than welcome, I hope to give it a little shot today and see
how it goes.
