As far as the 2.4.X series is concerned, pushing has not helped.  I've
seen spelling fixes and incorrorct changes get accepted from non
maintainers "instantly", while the maintainers changes are not accepted.
Considering how long it took for the last set of driver changes to make
it from -ac into kernel.org, I just assumed that this strategy was
also failing.  Is that really the only way to get updates into Marcelo's
tree?
