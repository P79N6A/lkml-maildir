So in short, kernel people:
- do not want perl in the kernel build
- allow qt to pollute the kernel to have a decent gui config tool
- have to rewrite half perl features in C
- but perl will be needed anyways
instead of
- do all parsing in perl, that is what perl is for and what is mainly done
  in kconfig scripts
- do the config backend in perl, and...
- do the gui in perl-XXX, so you can have perl-GTK, perl-GTK2, perl-QT or 
  perl-Tk, even perl-Xaw (so you get rid of tcl/tk)
I really do not understand...
