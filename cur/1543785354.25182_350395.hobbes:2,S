Those cases are handled by the driver calling pci_restore_state after
calling pci_set_power_state(..., PCI_D0).
The only time need_restore is actually needed is when the device is
first accessed after boot (signified by PCI_UNKNOWN).  When PCI drivers
load, they typically call pci_enable_device before doing anything else.
pci_enable_device calls pci_set_power_state(..., PCI_D0), which exposes
the device to potentially become uninitialized if it had previously
been left in PCI_D3hot.  Any other time pci_set_power_state(..., PCI_D0)
is called, drivers know to call (and can call) pci_restore_state
afterwards.
If not calling pci_restore_bars from pci_set_power_state during normal
transitions from PCI_D3hot was a problem, it would have been a problem
long before the pci_restore_bars patch came along in 2.6.14-rc1. :-)
