(embarrasing! i managed to put two serious bugs into a twoliner, hm.)

nice cleanups, and this now looks more and more like a zoned allocator.
there is one detail that i think still needs fixing: all three zones now
have basically the same bitmap size, which can take up a considerable
amount of memory:
      DMA:         xxx.........................................
      normal mem:  ...xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...................
      highmem:     .........................xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
the more zones we have, the more vastage - currently bitmaps are three
times as big as they need to be.
We do not need the dynamic overhead of an area->offset though, we can just
tweak frea_area[][].map's address in a way that offsets it exactly in such
a way that makes page indices universally correct in the current sense.
And not memset() all of free_area[][].map when initializing :)
