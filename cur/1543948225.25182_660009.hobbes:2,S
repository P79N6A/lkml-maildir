Adding CCs in case some iser users are not on the openfabrics list.
Original message is here:
http://lists.openfabrics.org/pipermail/general/2008-February/047111.html
This quoted commit is a regression for iSER.  Not sure if it causes
problems for the other FMR user, SRP.  It went in after v2.6.24.
Following this mail are two patches.  One to revert the change, and
one to attempt to do Olaf's patch in such a way that it does not
cause problems for other FMR users.
I haven't tested the patches with RDS.  It apparently isn't in the
tree yet.  In fact, there are no users of ib_flush_fmr_pool() in the
tree, which is the only function affected by the second patch.  But
iSER is working again in my scenario.
As a side note, I don't remember seeing this patch on the
openfabrics mailing list.  Perhaps I missed it.  Sometimes these
sorts of interactions can be spotted if proposed changes get wider
attention.
