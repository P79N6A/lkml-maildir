I figured that with 40 wires missing the chipset or drive wouldn't allow
UDMA-66 anyway or that the drive would immediately stop working thus
preventing data curruption.  If this is not the case and the drive can get
messed up then I would agree with defaulting to UDMA-33.  Although I still
think the appropiate speed should be retrievable from the BIOS if not the
chipset itself.  Another option is to allow the user to configure the
default from make menuconfig.
