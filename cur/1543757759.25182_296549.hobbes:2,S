It shouldn't be. If one read writer is active, another should be able to 
come in, regardless of any pending writer trying to access it. At least 
that's always been the rule for the rw-spinlocks _exactly_ for this 
reaseon.
The rwsem code tries to be fairer, maybe it has broken this case in the 
name of fairness. I personally think fairness is overrated, and would 
rather have the rwsem implementation let readers come in. But if we really 
don't want that, then:

We have a notion of "atomic get_user()" calls, which is a lot more 
efficient, and is already used for other cases where we have _real_
deadlocks (inode semaphore for reads into shared memory mappigns).
See "__copy_to_user_inatomic()", and in particular note that it
effectively _is_ legal to do user accesses with the preempt-count elevated 
or interrupts disabled to tell the page fault handler not to delay (then 
you have to check the error return, and if it returned an error you do it 
the slow way - drop all locks and do a non-atomic access).

DavidH - what's the word on nested read-semaphores like this? Are they 
supposed to work (like nested read-spinlocks), or do we need to do the 
things Olof does?
