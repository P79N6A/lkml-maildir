I can't say I like this, sorry.
- It adds another word to the timer_list structure for a very obscure
  application.  And a lot of kernel data structures aggregate timer_lists.
- There are places in the kernel which assume that once a timer is added
  on a CPU, it will stay there.  The timer handler re-arms the timer,
  confident in the knowledge that everything stays on this CPU.
  I recall working on such code a couple of years ago, but I now forget where
  it was.
  It is reasonable to do add_timer() within the CPU_ONLINE handler (for
  example), in the expectation that that timer will fire on this CPU.
  The proposed change permits the administrator to break that assumption.
  We would need to hunt down any code which makes that assumption and
  convert it to add_timer_on().  And we'd need to be very vigilant in the
  future, since people could easily add new code which had the old
  assumption which worked just fine for them in testing.
