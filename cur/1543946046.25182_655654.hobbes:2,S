Peter,
I don't remember any real time tasks running on the system, so I would be
surprised if that is indeed the case. Having said that, rightmost was indeed
NULL, so I need to figure out why it was. The other question is why would a real
time task be found by sched_yield_fair? I think we need to investigate more.
