Hard to get the client to support a feature in an experimental file 
system.  You are more likely to handle this like a system policy than 
something set by the client.  (Especially since an app designed to fill 
disk space could just mark its files as elastic to get around quotas.)

I think that would make a bunch of headaches for the app designer.  
Imaging having a cache directory with an indexed database in a directory 
marked as elastic.  What happens whenone part of the multi-file database 
gets nuked in the middle on operation?  You are going to have to 
handle much more error conditions for weird special cases to deal with 
files wandering away without having the app just halt.  (Most programs I 
have seen just halt when a file they need is not found.)
A better option in this case is to reduce the default size of Mozilla's 
cache or expand the size of the quota for each user to deal with the added 
space requirements.
If you are concerned about disk usage from caches, you can always create 
a script that removes the cache(s) when the user logs out.
