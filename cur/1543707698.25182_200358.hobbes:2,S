Why can't you just do the following to  get to the PCI device?
if (dev->bus_type == &pci_bus_type) {
	struct pci_dev pci_usb_dev = to_pci_dev(dev);
	...
}
If you mean the USB target device itself, can't you walk the
tree until you find a device that is no longer on bus_type
usb to determine your root?

You could stuff that into platform_data on PCI devices on your platforms.

I think we're not quite there yet, but once you have the device
struct, in theory, you can walk up the tree to grab the platform_data
for say the device's parent and do any tweaks based on platform-specific
bus parameters.  With PCI, you could even stuff this into pci_bus->sysdata.
I think having a function pointer table for things like dma mapping
and ioremap on all devices would be a very good thing, but not sure
if the powers that be would allow that in 2.6.
