kupdate and bdflush run filemap_fdatawait() without i_sem.  If kupdate has
moved a page off locked_pages to wait on it, a caller of fsync() just won't
see that page at all, and fsync can return while I/O is still in flight.
Given that this only applies to mmap data in 2.4 it doesn't seem
super-important.  A good way to fix it would be to not call
filemap_fdatawait() *at all* if the caller is kupdate or bdflush - it's
silly.   Could use a PF_foo flag for this?
