I've been working on the BP6 instability issue for some months now.
First I developed `burnP6` to test CPU's and cooling.  But machines
still locked up, and the MS-Windows crowd reported CRC unzipping errors.  
So I developed `burnBX` to test RAM and the controller.  Success!
I can generate RAM errors and occasional lockups.  Needless to say,
RAM errors are extremely serious, and will certainly cause a crash
or lockup if they occur during a kernel instruction fetch.  Since 
the errors are distributed across many addresses, and even in a 
few different bits, I don't think the SDRAM is actually causing it.
Most likely it is a problem with the 3.3V power supply.  Also possible
is a fundamental weakness in the Celeron IO drivers not being designed
for the extra capacitance.  Less likely, it is a problem with the BX 
chip [they've been overclocked to 133 MHz] or mobo trace routing [too 
simple to follow the rules].
An idle system really isn't.  Especially with X active, there will be
screen redraws that will approach `burnBX` in severity of RAM loading.
The power supply may not be able to handle the load transient well,
and the voltage sags too much.  I'm a little unhappy with my 300W PS,
because I've measured transients down to 3.16V, and statistically it's
likely that I get below 3V.  Nonetheless, I'm happy with my BP6 and
it's week+ stable (loaded or not) at 2 * 5.5 * 97 MHz.
I've just released the "stable" :) version of `burnBX`.  It is a very 
intense RAM tester with max bandwidth asm block-move instructions
and an evil data pattern to rapidly provoke errors.  I still use
and recommend Chris Brady's memtest-86 as a general memory tester.
Most importantly, it tests kernel-space RAM, which `burnBX` cannot.
I would invite people with stability problems to run `burnBX`.  I'd
be very surprised (and want to hear about) anybody that can run
`burnBX` for 1+ hour, yet still gets lockups.

The only "flaw" I can see is it uses powersupply 3.3V, instead of 
regulating it from 5V as some Asus boards do.  But that shouldn't
be a problem if a good powersupply is chosen.  I'd use the AMD Athlon
