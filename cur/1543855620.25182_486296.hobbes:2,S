Yeah, it's not so efficient to add a window before knowing it has a free
block, as rb tree insertion is quit expensive. Actually it used to be
this way: only insert a window to the rb tree when there is a free bit
inside of it. However we need to hold the per-fs reservation lock while
scanning the bitmap:( This badly hurt the performance in some case and
the real time folks complained about it. 
So we changed the code to the current way. I think it was not that
inefficient in the case it works across a fully allocated/reserved area,
since bitmap_search_next_usable_block() will skip the fully allocated
area fairly quickly, as it searchs from the beginning of the window till
the last block of the block group (not just the end of the window)

Good to know.

Thanks, I have acked most of them, and will port them to ext3/4 soon.
