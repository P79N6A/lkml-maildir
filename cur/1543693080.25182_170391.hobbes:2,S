Subject: error configuring for ARCH=arm

  as a first attempt in building a cross-compile toolchain
for my ARM-based sharp zaurus, i started with a clean 2.6.0-bk5
source tree and ran:
$ make ARCH=arm xconfig
make[1]: `scripts/fixdep' is up to date.
scripts/kconfig/qconf arch/arm/Kconfig
file net/bluetooth/Kconfig already scanned?
make[1]: *** [xconfig] Error 1
make: *** [xconfig] Error 2
  any thoughts?
