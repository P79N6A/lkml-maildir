I like that solution.  It's not small, but it works always.

That only works if you can find the right kernel source directory!
Today I was inspired by a new part of Red Hat's boot process.  It makes
a file in /boot containing some kernel parameters.
Which leads to an obvious thought.  How about a Makefile fragment in
/boot/config.mk that sets the appropriate CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS etc?  It's in
/boot because it reflects the kernel you're booting...
