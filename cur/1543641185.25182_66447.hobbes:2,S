David,
I just discovered your eMail posting on "GPG/PGP-signatures" of 14
August 2002.  Your eMail indicated that I was BCC'ed in.  I can advise
you I did not receive a copy of this posting.
I have checked the key server and find the key for the ID of this
eMail note to be there.  I did eMAil you back after loading my key to
confirm that I had correctly uploaded my GPG key to the key server. 
My PGP keys have been on the keyserver for some time.  I use PGP on
Windows NT when it is working (Been down since Mid may), and GPG on
Linux.  At some point I will manage to move over to GPG keys on NT.  I
would be happy to upload my other GPG keys to the key server once I am
certain I have uploaded my keys correctly.
Would you be so kind as to confirm I have uploaded my key for the
below noted eMail address ID.  Sorry of the manner I am using for
hiding my eMail address makes things difficult, but at 20- 30 SPAM
eMails a day I had to take action to prevent further abuse of my eMail
addresses.
Regards,
John L. Males

I think that it is great that people GPG/PGP-sign their posts
(and I intend to start doing so myself, as soon as I get proper
connectivity at home, and thus don't have to send all e-mail via a
remote server where I don't want to store my private key), but when
the
public keys are unavailable, hard to obtain, or invalid for one reason
or another, the signing is useless.
I've monitored the use of signatures on the list the last few
months, and have come up with this list of people whose signatures
I've been unable to find (neither available on wwwkeys.pgp.net nor
has a x-pgp or x-gpg header saying where to download the key):
Justin Carlson		C1A06FBE
Florent Chabaud		95C81C3C
Thomas Duffy		38F3C1BC
David Fries		CB1EE8F0
Roger Gammans		88DE0B3E
Austin Gonyou		59853282
Josh Litherland		893D9228
Brandon Low		1F012DC6
John L. Males		99ED3565
Brendan W. McAdams	82306710
Solomon Peachy		2DBBE7D0
Joe Radinger		F957E8F3
Udo A. Steinberg	233B9D29
Gianni Tedesco		8646BE7D
Martin Waitz		DFE80FB2
Derek James Witt	972FE938
Wiktor Wodecki		A1559FE7
Pete de Zwart		984AF710
I've bcc:d all of the above.
For those who who possibly don't know how to upload their public key
to a public server, here's how:
gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net --send-keys <keyid>

As a followup to my own post, I found the public keys for the
following
persons on search.keyserver.net (thanks to Roger Gammans for the
hint!);
Brandon Low
Solomon Peachy
Pete de Zwart
Gianno Tedesco (seems to have a broken mail-client; the signatures on
his posts are BAD, at least according to mutt/gnupg v1.0.7)
Roger Gammans
Finally a recommendation:
add
x-gpg-fingerprint: <fingerprint>
x-gpg-key: <url to your key or a keyserver>
to your mail-headers.

February/2000
***** Please BCC me in on any reply, not CC me.
Two reasons, I am not on the Mailing List,
and second I am suffering BIG time with SPAM
from posting to mailing lists/Newsgroups.
Instructions on real address at bottom.
Thanks in advance. *****
Please BCC me by replacing after the "@" as follows:
TLD =         The last three letters of the word "internet"
Domain name = The first four letters of the word "software",
              followed by the first four letters of the word
              "homeless".
My appologies in advance for the jumbled eMail address
and request to BCC me, but SPAM has become a very serious
problem.  The eMail address in my header information is
not a valid eMail address for me.  I needed to use a valid
domain due to ISP SMTP screen rules.
Please note: You may experience delays in my replies.  I will
             reply.
             This is due to major restoration activity to my riser
             section of the building.
             My internet access will be limited to a couple weekday
             evenings.  Weekend access will be a bit better but
             limited as an indirect consequence of the restoration
             work.
             If for any reason you need a more immediate reply or
             fail to receive a reply, please phone and leave a
             message.  If you do leave a phone message, please note
             that I may not be able to hear the message and/or
             reply until the evening.  This will be due to the
             extensive noise levels of the restoration work
             activity drowning out most other volume levels of
             sound.
             The work starts 22 July 2002.  Based on similar
             experience to other sections of the building I would
             estimate the major noise element of the work to be
             about 4+ weeks for my riser.  There will be secondary
             instances once other ajacent riser sections are done
             that will have a similar impact, but for lessor
             periods of time.
             My appologies in advance, but this is mandated work
             that must be done.[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream][unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream][unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream][unhandled content-type:application/pgp-signature]
