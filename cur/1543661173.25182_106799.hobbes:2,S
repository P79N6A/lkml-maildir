There seem to be quite a lot of mangled links there.  For example,
http://www.osdl.org/projects/dbt2dev/results/8way/LKML2/STP_8way_2.4v2.5.html#table0
links to
http:////www.osdl/org/projects/dbt2dev/results/8way/LKML2/c24.html
and
http://www.osdl.org/projects/dbt2dev/results/8way/LKML2/c24.html
links to
http://www.osdl/org/projects/dbt2dev/results/8way/LKML2/data/c24/296/vmstat.out
and when I fix up the latter:
http://www.osdl.org/projects/dbt2dev/results/8way/LKML2/data/c24/296/vmstat.out
it isn't there :(
However the numbers at
http://www.osdl.org/projects/dbt2dev/results/LKML_dbt2_2.4v2.5_both.html#table0
Seem to be showing increased user time in 2.5, decreased system time.  And
zero pgpgin/pgpgout in 2.5, which seems wrong.
I'd really like to see the vmstat traces.  Judging by the reduced idle time
in 2.5, this change could be due to more successful page replacement
decisions.
