while looking at some more warnings i got with allyesconfig i came across 
this really weird one:
In file included from drivers/cdrom/mcdx.c:78:
drivers/cdrom/mcdx.h:180:2: warning: #warning You have not edited mcdx.h
drivers/cdrom/mcdx.h:181:2: warning: #warning Perhaps irq and i/o settings 
are wrong.
looking into the code :
#ifndef I_WAS_HERE
#ifndef MODULE
#warning You have not edited mcdx.h
#warning Perhaps irq and i/o settings are wrong.
#endif
#endif
and before:
/* *** make the following line uncommented, if you're sure,
 * *** all configuration is done */
/* #define I_WAS_HERE */
huh?
is this file meant to be edited before compile ?
searched the list and came across some patch from adrian bunk:
[Patch] (new version) configure mcdx without editing mcdx.h
at 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=94772887906874&w=2
and 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=94724271712637&w=2
and 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=94699770112439&w=2
has this never been merged ?
regards
roland
