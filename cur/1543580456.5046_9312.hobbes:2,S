It should also be noted that there are several motherboards out there that 
claim to support 1GB or more of RAM which just plain don't, causing problems 
like this because the design is inadequate for the power requirements of that 
many chips (I have, unfortunately, had to work with some of these).  Sometimes 
you can work around it using different types of RAM (buffered vs. unbuffered, 
etc) but even this is iffy and not something I'd rely on for anything too 
important.
