Subject: which signal is sent to freeze process?

My understanding is that Linux kernel sends a signal to freeze processes
during suspend2ram operation. Which signal is used to achieve this?
The problem I am facing is that some of the system calls are failing
with EINTR errno during suspend operation and I want to install a signal
handler for freeze signal with SA_RESTART flag. That should make the
kernel to retry the system calls. Right?
Thanks,
Lomesh
