NVidia doesn't have a monopoly on crappy drivers, news at eleven..
__VMALLOC_RESERVE/VMALLOC_RESERVE is only used either in arch/i386 or
defined to MAXMEM whichs is also not used outside of arch/{i386,x86_64,mips}.
Doesn't exactly sounds like a published interface, heh?  Especially as there's
not sane way to use it outside memory managment code.
