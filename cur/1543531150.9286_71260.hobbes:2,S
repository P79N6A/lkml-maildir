Woops, sent that last email too early. :)

- Memory pressure does not appear to affect the problem.
- Booting "nosmp" seems to make the problem disappear (the problem seems
  to be SMP specific).
- The problem only seems to happen when copying files between drives
  (copying on the same filesystem does not seem to reproduce it).
- The problem does not seem to occur when copying files from one drive
  to another on the same IDE bus.  This may be a coincidence of my setup,
  however -- I only have hda, hdb, and hdc, an hdc contains only 1K block
  EXT2 filesystems.  hda and hdb contain 2K and 4K filesystems.
The problem occurs when copying from /dev/hdc2 (1K EXT2 filesystem) to
/dev/hdb1 (2K EXT2 filesystem).  I haven't been able to reproduce it
copying from hda4 (4K) to hdb2 (2K).  I also haven't been able to
reproduce it copying from hda4 (4K) to hdc2 (1K).  I'm not sure if this
is a result of the direction of the copying or an indication of a
filesystem blocksize dependency.
I just reproduced it copying in the exact opposite direction (/dev/hdb1
to /dev/hdc2) from the original way I reproduced it.  This is from a 2K
to a 1K.  Aha!  I just reproduced it going from /dev/hdb4 (4K) to /dev/hdc2
(1K), so the source blocksize does not seem to matter.  I should see if I
can reformat hdc to have a 4K filesystem, I suppose... Although I'm
getting the feeling the problem might be completely independent of block
size...
So, SMP definitely makes a difference and IDE bus definitely makes a
difference.
