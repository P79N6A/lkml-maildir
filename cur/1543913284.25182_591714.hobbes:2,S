Thanks for CCing me.  I'm also adding the CC of Kristian, author and
other maintainer of the code in question.

drivers/firewire/fw-ohci.c -> fw-ohci.o -> firewire-ohci.o ->
firewire-ohci.ko

The old ohci1394.c used to ignore pci_set_power_state's return value.
In the pre 2.6.19-rc1 commit ea6104c22468239083857fa07425c312b1ecb424, I
added a fail-on-error.  This was toned down to a printk-on-err by pre
2.6.19-rc4 commit 346f5c7ee7fa4ebee0e4c96415a7e59716bfa1d0.
This was because of Benjamin Herrenschmidt's regression report:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/24/13
So, we went into the same trap again with fw-ohci.  I should have
noticed how fw-ohci treats pci_set_power_state when I signed off the
commit which added the suspend/resume methods to fw-ohci --- but somehow
I didn't.

A trivial post -rc1 compatible fix is coming in a minute.
