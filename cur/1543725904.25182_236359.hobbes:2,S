I am not so sure I like this.  I want less printk's, not more.
Maybe we can add a send_event_and_printk() if the demand is high.  That
is fine, but I do not want the default events to cause printks.  Printks
are usually human readable sentences, change often, terribly unstable,
etc.  The events should be more basic and stable.

That is the idea ;-)
