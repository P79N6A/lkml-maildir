Just gave it a test on my laptop and server.  Both are p3.  The
laptop is under heavier mem pressure; the server has just under
a gig with most free/cache/buff.  Laptop is still running 2.6.7
whereas the server is bk as of 2004-10-24.
Buth took about 11 seconds for the private and around 30 seconds
for the shared tests.
So if this is a regression, it predates v2.6.7.
