I implemented it for long mode on x86-64.
It has to be done before the vesafb is initialized too, otherwise
you cannot see the error message.
You could copy the code from arch/x86_64/boot/setup.S 
(starting with /* check for long mode. */) and change it to
check for the CPUID bits you want. x86-64 checks a basic collection
that has been determined to be the base set of x86-64 supporting CPUs.
But it could be less or more.
