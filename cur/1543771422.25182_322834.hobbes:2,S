The other patch avoids sending to offline cpu's, but we read cpu_online_map
and clear self bit in smp_call_function. If a cpu comes online, dont we 
want this cpu to take part in smp_call_function?
if we dont care about this new CPU participating, and if cpu_set() is atomic
(for all NR_CPUS) we dont need to hold call_lock, otherwise we need to hold
this as well.

Will do. I think we could cleanup more of the cpu state before we do safe_halt.
But i think i need to look how much more state can be cleaned out. 
In Ia64, we have a clear SAL handoff state, and essentially the cpu is handed
off as OS got it back to BIOS land. Althoght that might be a hard goal 
i need to look at what states _must_ be cleaned out as next step.
