Subject: slow OOM killing with 2.6.9?

I've got a ppc box with 2GB of ram, running 2.6.9.
If I run a few instances of memory chewing programs, eventually the OOM-killer 
kicks in.  At that point, the machine locks up for about 10 seconds while 
deciding what to kill.
Is this expected behaviour?  Is there any way to speed this up?
Thanks,
Chris
