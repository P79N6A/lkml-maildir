Hmm, but kswapd, which is main worker of page reclaiming, is per-node.
And reclaim is done based on zone.
per-zone/per-node throttling seems to make sense.
I know his environment has 4cpus per node but throttle to 3 was the best
number in his measurement. Then it seems num-per-cpu is excessive.
(At least, ratio(%) is better.)
When zone-reclaiming is improved to be scale well, we'll have to change
this throttle.
BTW, could someone try his patch on x86_64/ppc ? 
I'd like to see how contention is heavy on other machines.
Thanks,
