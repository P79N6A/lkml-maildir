I too have been experiencing this on a gateway for a DSL modem.  The
backtrace is almost exactly the same.  On this machine, the bug results
in an "Aieee:  Killing Interrupt Handler".  I have to manually copy the
oops, and as such I copied only the backtrace, and parts of it may be
incorrect.  I've attached it anyway, just in case it helps someone.
I would really like to see this fixed, and so am willing to help
diagnose and test any patches.
