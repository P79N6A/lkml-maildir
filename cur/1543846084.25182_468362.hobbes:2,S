I think most of these changes are good. However, some comments:
* There are many logically independent parts in this change, so they
  should be in separate patches. For example:
  - Introduce the DRIVER_NAME #define.
  - Add sysfs support.
  - Make procfs support optional.
  - Implement congestion control.
  - Move lots of functions around. (Is it needed at all?)
* You need to add Signed-off-by.
* You should CC Andrew Morton and not Linus. These changes should live
  in -mm for a while before going into the main tree.
* The patch is white space damaged. All lines that should start with a
  single space start with two spaces.
