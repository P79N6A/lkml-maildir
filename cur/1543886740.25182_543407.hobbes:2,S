Actually, when I talked with AMD, they told me that cpus should last
10 years *at their max specced temperature*... which is 95Celsius. So
overclocking is not that evil, according to my info.
(That would mean way more than 10 years if you use your cpu
'normally'.)
But I guess capacitors from cpu power supply will hate you running cpu
at 95C...
