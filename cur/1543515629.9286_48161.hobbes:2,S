Disks are unpredictable when it comes to that, if you want real time
audio editing or video editing for that sake, you either want to go
with a hard real time system (like RTLinux) which can guarantee
service of the devices in question or you want to seriously over power
your system to make it a 99.99% chance it will be able to keep up.
If RTLinux is too limited for your specific hard real time purpose,
maybe it was better to fix that than to try and turn the generic
kernel into an RT one.
