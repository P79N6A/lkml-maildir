Suppose that an entry on any filesystem could be replaced by a symlink
which pointed to a URL, and that an appropriate handler was dispatched
for that URL.  This would allow, for example, config files to point to
a different machine.
Right now we can accomplish this by mounting alternative file systems
and symlinking to them, but only if an appropriate file system has
been written.
