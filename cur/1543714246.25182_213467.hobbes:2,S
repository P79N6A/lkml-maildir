Yeah, I've experemented recently with PAT too.  Not had a chance to look at
the code in any specifics.  But I did notice there appear to be no notes or
warnings on the issues of using PAT based mappings.  Cirtainly there are
some _very_ onerus restrictions which I have personally tested and found to
be true :(.  Perhaps we could get some big fat warning style comments.
Cirtainly the documentation is _very_ specific about this limitation, I
think I saw this being implmented in the code.

Also, I have confirmed that if you have any Intel processors which do not
have the SS (Self Snoop) capability, you cannot have two independent
mappings to a page with different cache attributes.  I have been hit by
this and you get stale data returned from the cache.
