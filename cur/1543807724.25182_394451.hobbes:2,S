I'll do comment.

I'm starting to think that nothing in upstream can be better for all of 
us :)

Exactly! All these patches for A) look weird for me without containers 
itself. A try to make half-solution which is bad.

Have you saw my patches?
This is B) :) This is what we should start with IMHO.
Having a containers and isolation all these talks about A) will be much 
more precise.
