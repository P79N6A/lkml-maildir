It's equally confusing to find out that link(2) doesn't preserve
file properties.
Frankly, I'm less than sure that ability to raise capabilities is
a good thing - being able to drop them is certainly nice, but I doubt
that partial suid-root will be better than full suid-root and it
certainly makes security model even more complex.  And incomplete
understanding of security model is a great recipe for PITA - demonstrated
way too many times already...
Folks, seriously - it might be very tempting to add features in that
area, but more features actually increase overall security.  Just look
at the track record of systems with baroque security models and ask
yourself whether we want to go there.
