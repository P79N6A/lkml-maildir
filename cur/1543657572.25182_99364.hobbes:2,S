Well, yes, but the underlying allocators will also have to take the flag too 
so that all the semantics are correct.

The obvious one is allocations from interrupt routines, which must be 
GFP_ATOMIC (ignoring the issue of whether a driver should be doing a memory 
allocation in an interrupt).  Allocating large pools at driver initialisation 
should probably be GFP_KERNEL as you say.
