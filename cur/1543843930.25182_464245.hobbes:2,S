Then you're using the term so broadly as to lose specific meaning.

Unless one's worried about planetary-scale energy use, I see no point
in multiplying overheads by "every box on the planet".

Unfortunately, cases in which this sort of out-of-band markup would be
sufficient are pretty much those exact same cases where it is not
necessary.  Remember, the complex cases occur when the compiler munges
up control flow and data accessability, so debuginfo cannot or does
not correctly place the probes and their data gathering compatriots.
