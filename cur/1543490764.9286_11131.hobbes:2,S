Ok. It says basically what its always said. With additions for UDMA stuff.

Ok. This tells me its using DMA. It doesn't comment on which MODE of dma
(or udma) it is in. How is this what I wanted? I mean, I was looking for
information on the current UDMA modes that my drives are in. I probably am
mistaking, but the dma in "hdparm -d" is a different monster entirely than
the UDMA I'm speaking about. I thought UDMA (in this context) simply
refered to modes that are brothers for the various PIO modes.
How does "hdparm -d /dev/hda" fit into that?
 # Ignore that error -- triggered by hdparm, so it's really self-inflicted.
 # And totally harmless.
Ok, cool.

Ok, so I guess I'm missing something here. Perhaps my original question
wasn't phrased correctly, or I simply am speaking mush. Let me try again.
"" 
1. Why does hdparm report all my drives in UDMA mode2 when I have it
disabled in BIOS and have CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO disabled? Is it the default
on the drives THEMSELVES? Then what effect does BIOS have on this? None?
2. If the drives are infact in UDMA mode2, why does hdparm -X66 crash my
system. Does that command not say to put the drives in UDMA mode2?
3. How does one disable UDMA but keep DMA enabled? For example, if I just
wanted to use DMA multiword mode 2? According to man, 
   hdparm -X34 /dev/hda
should do it. But if I do that, my system locks up immediately with a
"can't get DMA for /dev/hda" or somesuch. Shouldn't my drive support
mword2 if it supports UDMA mode 2? (btw...

hdc: WDC AC36400L, 6149MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=13328/15/63
According to specs, all my drives support UDMA mode 2).
4. So I gues the question is, why can't I tweak any of the drives? Why
cant I put them in UDMA mode 2 when they say they already are? Why can't I
put them in DMA mode 2 without crashing my system?
