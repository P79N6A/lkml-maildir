Here is the trace
1. file system is made with sbin/mkfs.ext2 -F -b 1024 /dev/hda9 60
and  mounted with -o sync,dirsync
1.  operations FiSC did:
creat(/mnt/sbd0/0001)
write(/mnt/sbd0/0001)
rename(/mnt/sbd0/0001, /mnt/sbd0/0002)
mkdir(/mnt/sbd0/0003)
2.  FiSC "crashed" the test machine  after mkdir returns.  Crashed
disk image can be downloaded at: 
http://fisc.stanford.edu/bug2/crash.img.bz2
e2fsck output is:
e2fsck 1.36 (05-Feb-2005)
/dev/hda9 was not cleanly unmounted, check
forced.
