Subject: [PATCH] [2/2] POWERPC: Lower threshold for DART enablement to 1GB

Hi,
This goes with the previous dma_mask patch -- enable DART at 1GB due to
Airport Extreme cards needing it. Please consider for 2.6.17.
Thanks,
Olof

Turn on the DART already at 1GB. This is needed because of crippled
devices in some systems, i.e. Airport Extreme cards, only supporting
30-bit DMA addresses.
Otherwise, users with between 1 and 2GB of memory will need to manually
enable it with iommu=force, and that's no good.
Some simple performance tests show that there's a slight impact of
enabling DART, but it's in the 1-3% range (kernel build with disk I/O
as well as over NFS).
iommu=off can still be used for those who don't want to deal with the
overhead (and don't need it for any devices).
