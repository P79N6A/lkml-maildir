FWIW, this is how Windows does it now.  As of XP, 'Find files' has an
option, enabled by default, to look inside archives.  If you tell it to
look for a driver in a given directory it will also look inside .cab 
and .zip files.  It's extremely useful, I would imagine someone who uses
XP a lot will come to expect this feature.
Of course, no idea how it's implemented, but users like it.
