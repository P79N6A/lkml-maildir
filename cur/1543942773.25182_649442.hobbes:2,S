My latest version of get_scan_ratio() works differently, with the
percentages always adding up to 100.  However, your patch gave me
the inspiration to (hopefully) find the bug in my version of the
code.

I do not believe my new code has this problem.  Of course, this
is purely due to luck :)

This is probably where the problem is.  Kind of.
I believe that the problem is that we scale nr[l] by the percentage,
instead of scaling the amount we add to zone->nr_scan[l] by the
percentage!

With the fix below (against my latest tree), we always add at least one
to zone->nr_scan[l] and always make that increment count later on!
I am still recovering from my trip home (thanks to the airline companies
I spent 25 hours travelling, from door to door), so I may not get around
to actually testing this today:
