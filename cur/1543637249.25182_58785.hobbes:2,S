Thank you, it is surely incorrect (in the case where the do_munmap does
not cover the whole vma, leaving one or two pieces behind: I think that
must be the case you're remembering).  Would a patch which (if necessary)
reapplies VM_ACCOUNT to the leftover piece(s) be welcome, or would it
just look like an ugly face-saving exercise?

Okay, will do, thanks.  And you will also ignore patches 2/3, 3/3 now,
since David has given a clear vote for more MAP_NORESERVE consistency,
and VM_NORESERVE would be more natural to pass from do_mmap_pgoff to
shmem_file_setup than my VM_SHARED|VM_ACCOUNT abuse.
But I'll still have a consistency problem with MAP_NORESERVE versus
sysctl_overcommit_memory, when the latter is changed (> 1 or <= 1).
The closest I can get to a consistent position is that do_mmap_pgoff
only sets VM_NORESERVE if MAP_NORESERVE and sysctl_overcommit_memory
<= 1 (as you wish), but that thereafter (in mprotect and in mremap,
even when extending the mapping) VM_NORESERVE will be respected (and
propagated when splitting) even while sysctl_overcommit_memory > 1.
Mirroring the vice versa situation, of the reservations made when
MAP_NORESERVE is ignored, and thereafter.
You might prefer more draconian enforcment, but I fear it
could behave strangely.  Does the above sound fair to you?
