Sigh, sacrifice for the common case! :P

I prefer:
   prio_array_t *target = rq->active;
   if (batch_task(p))
     target = rq->expired;
   enqueue_task(p, target);
Because gcc can use things like predicated instructions for it.
But perhaps it is smart enough these days to recognise this?
At least in the past I have seen it start using cmov after doing
such a conversion.
At any rate, I think it looks nicer as well. IMO, of course.
