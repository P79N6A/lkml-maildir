Subject: RE: Proposed patch tty_io.c/8K write split

-> I have previously posted a suggestion to allow line disciplines
-> to avoid the splitting of write() calls into 8K chunks. No 
-> one objected
-> so I am posting the actual patch for comments. The patch is 
-> against 2.2.11.
-> The point of this change is to allow a line discipline I wrote to
-> process complete write() calls without interference from tty_io.c.
-> 
-> The change adds a new TTY flag that suppresses the write split
-> in tty_io.c. If this flag is not set then the behavior is 
-> unchanged. If set
-> then the line discipline write routine is called with the 
-> parameters of the
-> original write (no write split). When a line discipline is 
-> loaded (ldisc
-> open called)
-> then the ldisc can set the flag if necessary. When the ldisc 
-> is unloaded
-> (ldisc close called), then the flag can be restored.
-> 
-> This patch is very minimal and does not change the default 
-> behavior if the
-> new flag is not set. Please post any objections. If none are 
-> raised then
-> I will submit this patch.
