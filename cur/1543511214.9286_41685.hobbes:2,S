Look at it that way: we have a bunch of trees internally (dentry trees).
And we have a couple of mappings (d_covers and d_mounts) that join them
into the namespace. OK. Now, let's define namespace as such pair of
mappings (mutually inverse, indeed). IOW, a binary relation between the
dentries. Notice that almost all work is done within the trees - just a
couple of functions deals with crossing their boundaries. Current
implementation uses a couple of pointers in struct dentry. Now, let's
introduce a cache of triples <namespace ID, dentry-from, dentry-to> and
replace traversing the mountpoint with cache lookup. With a reasonable
hash-function it's not that slower than the current variant (the
difference will be lost in noise from lookup_dentry() internals).

	In *each* instance of proc, you mean.
There is one big problem: what will you do with such devices? What kind of
semantics can you have for them? Introducing them just to close the kludge
with NFS mounting... ;-/ IMHO it's fixing a kludge with worse one...
