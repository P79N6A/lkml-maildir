It could be that, but I suspect something strange, the cd reports itself to be 
about 80', then cdrecord is unable to write past this 80', after cdrecord 
fixates the cd and ejects it I can see that there is still a virgin zone of 
about 5 milimeters at the edge of the disk.
On the other hand I have been able to overburn some cd to gain about half a 
minute when needed, but these were 74 or 80 minutes media.
The most strange thing is the scsi error, "no error":
Input/output error. write_g1: scsi sendcmd: no error
