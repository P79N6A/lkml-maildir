Has anybody bothered to check the current PCI code?
"struct pci_dev" contains the name of the PCI device ("dev->name",
surprise, surprise), and it has been copied there from __initdata
information that is discarded after bootup so that we don't waste run-time
memory on keeping all the PCI names around when they aren't needed (ie
only the devices that were found have the name).
"oldproc" is gone - because the name is there, and it's there to stay.
Exactly because there are so many cases where it's just nice to have the
information available (/proc/iomem, device driver diagnostic messages
etc).
