Yep, just want to highlight to people that your patches (or an
alternative) are needed before the same pv_ops kernel truly can be used
on bare-metal and Xen.

With this, AFLAGS would apply to building when building the
prerequisites of header.o too, which you don't want
The make manual says:
  "when you define a target-specific variable that variable value is
   also in effect for all prerequisites of this target, and all their
   prerequisites"

And with this, it would try and read vmlinux before it is built.
But, hmm, given the fact that the variable is defined when building
prerequisites, you'd think that even in my version AFLAGS would be
evaluated before building vmlinux.
Cheers,
Mark.
