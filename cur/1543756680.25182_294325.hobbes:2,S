Ah well that may be a good way to do it indeed. As I said, I
don't know much about privileges etc.
But I just want to be clear that I'm not trying to stop RT-LSM
going in (if only because I don't care one way or the other
about it).

I'd have to re-read the standard, but it may not be. For example,
a compliant system advertises the minimum and maximum priority
levels available - you may be able to adjust these based on what
the rlimit is set to. On the other hand, yes it may violate the
stanards.
