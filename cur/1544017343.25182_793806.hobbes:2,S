Didnt you come up with the verdict that sched_mc=2 is not a win - or has 
that changed? If we should change the defaults then please send a 
re-tuning patch against the latest code.
Still, the ping delays of multiple seconds are completely unacceptable and 
need to be understood, or these will come back and might bite us in a lot 
less fortunate place. NEWIDLE and WAKE_BALANCE has micro-effects on 
latencies - anything in the user-visible range is highly anomalous at 
these low load levels.
