mISDN has two problems, which are of course interrelated:
a) complete lack of documentation for the in-kernel driver interface
    (equivalent of Documentation/isdn/INTERFACE)
b) still doesn't support all the hardware isdn4linux supports.
As long as those problems aren't solved, the old stuff cannot be removed.
Perhaps merging the current state of mISDN into the -mm tree would help
with this. Perhaps not.

documentation on how to convert to the new CAPI/mISDN world
but tired of asking for it in vain)
