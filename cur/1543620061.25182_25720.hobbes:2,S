[MODEL]=VT8366 (KT266) Athlon NB
[VID]=1106:VIA
[DID]=3099:Host to PCI Bridge
[75:7]=Arbitration Mode         0=REQ-based 1=Frame-based
(75:6)=CPU Latency Timer                read only
(75:5)=(same as above)
(75:4)=(same as above)
[75:3]=(Reserved)
[75:2]=PCI Master Bus Time-Out  000=Disable
[75:1]=001=1x32 PCICLKs         010=2x32 PCICLKs
[75:0]=011=3x32 PCICLKs ...     111=7x32 PCICLKs
Note: other doc I have (for KT266A) says 75.3 is used for PCI Master Bus 
Time-Out too (thus max timeout is 1111 = 15x32 PCICLKs)
[76:7]=I/O Port 22 Enable
[76:6]=(Reserved)
[76:5]=Master Priority Rotation 0x=every PCI master grant
[76:4]=10=after every 2 PCI     11=after every 3 PCI
[76:3]=REQn# to REQ4# Mapping   00=REQ4#    01=REQ0#
[76:2]=10=REQ1#    11=REQ2#
[76:1]=(Reserved)
[76:0]=REQ4# Is High Priority   0=disable   1=enable
KT266A doc says:
76.5-4: Master Priority Rotation: 00 disable
        01 every PCI master grant
        10 every 2 PCI master grant
        11 every 3 PCI master grant
