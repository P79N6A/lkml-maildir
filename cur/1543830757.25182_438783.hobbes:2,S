It is _not_ coming from a working tree at all.
git-tar-tree generates the tar image from a git tree object, and
when it does so, it deliberately sets the mode bits to 0666/0777
so that umask of the people who extract the tarball is honored.
In very early days once we made a mistake of generating the tar
archive with more restrictive permission bits (I think it was
0644 or 0755) which was very impolite way to annoy people with
002 umask.
