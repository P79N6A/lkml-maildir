see my last email. And I think he needed it as an additional syscall
after execve that he could trap and revirtualize with ptrace as usual
and that would return variable addresses of pointer to functions (that
would be revirtualized inside the uml kernel of course), not an ELF
information that should be valid for both UML and host kernel.
