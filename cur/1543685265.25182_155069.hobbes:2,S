I am running 2.6-test2 kernel. Download the perl 5.8.0 (stable.tar.gz).
./Configure --prefix=/mnt/hdc3; make; make install.
It did not happen for me. Hash::Util.3 was installed correctly.
(Of course, I did turn on directory index)
Can you send me more infomation how you build the perl package
and install it? I guess I have to do more gentoo like step to duplicate
it :-)
Thanks
Chris
