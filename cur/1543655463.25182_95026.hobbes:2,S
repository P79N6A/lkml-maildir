   For s390/s390x this is actually quite tricky. The system call number is
   coded in the instruction, e.g. 0x0aa2 is svc 162 or sys_nanosleep. There
   is no register involved that contains the system call number I could
   simply change. I either have to change the instruction (no way) or I
   have to avoid going back to userspace in this case. This would require
   assembler magic in entry.S. Not nice.
Put the magic restart_block syscall at some fixed place in every
user process, change the PC to that.  Or, alternatively, put the
restart_block syscall insn on the stack and point the PC at that.
This isn't rocket science :-)
