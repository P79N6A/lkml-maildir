I suspected that'd be the case.  Some pointer into the archives
would be good, though I'd suspect the basic summary is that it'd
be too much like devfs that way.  Did the same statement apply to
adding some file that wasn't a device special file?  That kind
of solution moves in the "no majors/minors" direction, which I
thought was the general goal.  Leaves a naming policy debate,
but one that ought to be more managable (say, with devlabel).
Though I guess my original reaction still stands then:  I don't
much want to care about major/minor numbers, so why not just leave
them out in favor of whatever better solution is the goal?  Save
everyone the intermediate steps!
