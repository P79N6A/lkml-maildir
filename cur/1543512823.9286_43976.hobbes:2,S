Artur,
A few minor things:

I bet you don't mean that, it still depends on the dynamic
priority. Is there demand for a true "don't schedule me if there's
anybody else runnable at all"? It might be a little tricky to
implement with zero impact to the fast path.

With you patch add_to_runqueue becomes dead code, just remove it?

One set of brackets should be good enough here :)

I think I see what Andrea means here. Scenario: CPU 0 runs process A,
CPU 1 is idle, runqueue has only A. RT process B wakes up, previously
run on CPU 0 and decides switching to CPU 1 is too expensive. Process
A calls sched_yield(). You better reschedule.
We can maintain smp_num_idle_cpus but I doubt it's worth it just for
this particular check. Unless rc5des calls sched_yield ;)

Borislav
