True.  Note too, though, that on a filesystem (which we are, after all,
talking about), if you assume a large linear space you have to create a
file, which means you need to multiply the cost of all random-access
operations with O(log n).

Well, once you multiply with O(log n) for the file indirection (which
B-trees don't need, since they inherently handle blocking and thus can
use block pointers directly) then the asymptotic complexity is the same
as well, and I think the B-trees are the overall winner.
