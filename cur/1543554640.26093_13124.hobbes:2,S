I've recently run into what look like some kernel bugs[1] in the 2.2.17
kernel (on a sparcstation 2 (sun4c) and a javasation (sun4m)).  I've
posted them to the sparclinux mailing list, but I was wondering if there
was somewhere else (e.g., here) that I should send them.
Is there anyone actively maintaining the sparc port?
Thanks,

[1] kernel oops on the javastation triggered by mis-detected floppy drive,
    and memory allocation issues on the sparcstation 2 that result in
    kmem_cache_alloc() failing.
