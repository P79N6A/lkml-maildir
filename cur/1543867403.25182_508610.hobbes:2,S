the syslet_uatom has a constant size right now, and space for a maximum 
of 6 arguments. /If/ the user knows that a specific atom (which for 
example does a sys_close()) takes only 1 argument, it could shrink the 
size of the atom down by 4 arguments.

  that side-note in the header file :-) ]
there should be no new ABI issues: the existing syscall ABI never 
changes, it's only extended. New syslets can rely on new properties of 
new system calls. This is quite parallel to how glibc handles system 
calls.

syslet users would preferably be libraries like glibc - not applications 
- i'm not sure the raw syslet interface should be exposed to 
applications. Thus my current thinking is that syslets ought to be 
per-arch structures - no need to pad them out to 64 bits on 32-bit 
architectures - it's per-arch userspace that makes use of them anyway. 
system call encodings are fundamentally per-arch anyway - every arch 
does various fixups and has its own order of system calls.
but ... i'd not be against having a 'generic syscall layer' though, and 
syslets might be a good starting point for that. But that would 
necessiate a per-arch table of translating syscall numbers into this 
'generic' numbering, at minimum - or a separate sys_async_call_table[].
