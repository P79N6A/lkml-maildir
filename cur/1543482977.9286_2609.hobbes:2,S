It does not work, and I'm trying to fix it among other problems...

Indeed, but not all MMIO space is permanently mapped on PPC (very hard to
fix with some devices and the way some FW spread addresses when
allocating PCI resources), so ioremap has to use the normal mapping
mechanism in some occasions.

Yes, and read[bwl]/write[bwl] also add a barrier instruction after each
access. This may hurt badly, and it is perfectly possible to add barriers
explicitly in newly written drivers.

Indeed, but I'm probably too stupid and I would like to understand what
the following code on the Alpha means (in arch/alpha/kernel/bios32.c,
but there is something similar in Sparc64): 
			pcibios_write_config_dword(bus->number, dev->devfn,
						   off, base);
			new_io_reset(dev, off, orig_base);
			handle = PCI_HANDLE(bus->number) | base;
			dev->base_address[idx] = handle;
Obviously, unless the code is needlessly obfuscated, dev->base_address
will _not_ have the same value as the base register in the PCI
configuration space. Shouldn't it be the same on PreP, where to access the
MMIO at address 0x123456, the physical address is 0xC0123456 since the bridge 
subtracts 0xc0000000 from the address appearing on the CPU pins ? 
Then it's mapped at a different virtual address to avoid conflicts with
the kernel itself but it's another matter (handled by ioremap). 
I've been trying to solve this problem but never got a clear answer. I had 
come to the conclusion that it should be:
  pci_read_config_dword(dev, PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_n, &base)  
  dev->base_address[n]   = base+0xc0000000 (adjusted by pcibios_fixup())  
  address used in driver = ioremap(dev->base_address[n]) 
in this case, lspci -v and lspci -vb do not display the same addresses.
That's what I have right now and I had to make a minor fix to one driver
to get the system running.
What should it be before I send some patches to the PPC maintainers ? 
	Gabriel.
