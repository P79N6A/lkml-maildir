How much is significant? The term doesn't really help much. I will say 
that with one NIC taking 120MB/sec of data to a TB database and copying 
to two other machine (~220MB)  my interrupts got up in in the 5k-12k 
range with essentially CPU0 doing the work, some few percent going to CPU2.
I'm not sure this is a problem in any way, but some serious load is 
needed to trigger sharing, if indeed the NIC was the source of the ints 
on CPU2.
2x Xeon-2.4GHz, HT enabled. "CPU2" from memory, it was the other 
physical CPU, not another sibling. Worked fine, didn't break, don't 
regard it as a problem.
