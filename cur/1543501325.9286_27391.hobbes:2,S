Yo,
I am writing an ip masquerading module for RTSP/RTP (Streaming Media)
connections. The translation and rewriting of the protocol headers
and packets all works great now, and I'm at the point where I can
change my userland testcode to a kernel module.
I've got some questions though...
At the end of my module, after I've setup the masquerading tunnels,
I would like to replace the whole RTSP request that's in skb_p with a
new one. How do I replace that skb. I tried to skb_alloc a new one,
but that resulted in a crash. Also, when I replace the old one with
a new one, do I still have to return the difference in size between
the old and new request?
