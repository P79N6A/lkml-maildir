Yeh, but who in their right mind would do that???

Does it?
I guess filling with zeros isn't what one would expect, but you could
make a case for it being right.
  write(fd, 0, size)
writes 'size' 0s.  Cool.   Ok, bad-cool.

I cannot see why you make a change to fault_in_pages_writeable.  Is it
just for symmetry?
For the rest, it certainly makes sense to return an early -EFAULT if
you cannot fault in the page.
