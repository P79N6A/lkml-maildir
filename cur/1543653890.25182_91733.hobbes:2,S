Ok, thanks.

Indeed.

Not so sure about that, because only the sonypi device init/free
make use of ACPI. After that, I still have to use the 'proprietary'
protocol over the sonypi iports.
It will simplify the code a little, especially when dealing with new
models which could have a third initialisation way (we already handle
2 differents Vaio types). 
But once again, the old code is here to stay, until/if ACPI becomes
mandatory.

Agreed, this is a low priority item, I'll take a look at the
existent ACPI drivers when I'll have a slow weekend...
