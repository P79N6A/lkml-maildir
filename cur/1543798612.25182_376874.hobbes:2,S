Right.
But clone(CLONE_NEWNS) and unshare(CLONE_NEWNS) _don't_ behave like
that: clone(CLONE_NEWNS) unshares ns, and unshare(CLONE_NEWNFS) _also_
unshares ns.
That is the inconsistency: some flags to clone() mean "keep sharing
this thing", and some flags mean "make a new instance of this thing".
It's not your fault that clone() has that inconsistency.  It's because
clone() needs to treat a value of 0 for any bit as the historically
default behaviour.
Like clone(), unshare() will have to change from year to year, as new
flags are added.  It would be good if the default behaviour of 0 bits
to unshare() also did the right thing, so that programs compiled in
2006 still function as expected in 2010.  Hmm, this
forward-compatibility does not look pretty.
