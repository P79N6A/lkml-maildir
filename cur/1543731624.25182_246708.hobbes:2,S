well, isn't that namespace fragmentation by definition?  If you can't go
cat filenameA/metas/permissions > filenameB/metas/permissions
find / -exec cat {}/permissions \; | grep 4777 | wc -l
then aren't you missing the whole point of this exercise which is to 
allow the whole OS to be better integrated into a more unified namespace 
so that data can leap from one tool to another, and one container to 
another, with the greatest of ease?  If cat cannot access the metadata 
without changing the code of cat, then all the elegance goes poof.
It completely baffles me what disabling filenameA/.. does for us.  Why 
add asymmetries?  Ease of implementation is no excuse for such asymmetry.
Tomorrow I am going to send a little essay I wrote this evening on these 
metafiles.
