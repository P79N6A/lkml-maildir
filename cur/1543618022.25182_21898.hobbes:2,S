If your ->writepage() writes pages to disk it just means
that reiserfs will be able to clean its pages faster than
the other filesystems.
This means the VM will not call reiserfs ->writepage() as
often as for the other filesystems, since more of the
pages it finds will already be clean and freeable.
I guess the only way to unbalance the caches is by actually
freeing pages in ->writepage, but I don't see any real reason
why you'd want to do that...

Rik
