I have an "IBM Rapidaccess II" keyboard with a few miscellaneous keys 
in the top and center, with a few more CD-player type controls in the 
upper left.  You don't need an "activation code", just something to 
handle its funny scancodes.  I use hotkeys to manage it.  There's a 
Debian package for it:
