getwd() fails if the issuing user does not have access to the underlying 
mount-point of a particular directory.
Is there any way to acquire the underlying mount-point info 
(i-node/stat) after mounting a new one over it _without unmounting_ the 
new filesystem, or is the i-node information inaccessible until a umount 
occurs?
