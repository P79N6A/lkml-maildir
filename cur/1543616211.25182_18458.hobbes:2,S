Works beautifully with devfs+devfsd :-)
Permissions get saved elsewhere in the namespace (perhaps even to the
underlying /dev) as you chown(2)/chmod(2)/mknod(2), and are restored
when entries are (re)created and/or at startup.
My /dev has persistence behaviour which looks like a FS with backing
store.
