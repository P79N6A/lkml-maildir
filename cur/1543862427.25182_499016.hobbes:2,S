well technically they don't need to be changed at all because they ARE
gpl as long as they're part of the kernel effectively (LGPL has that
"conversion to GPL" clause) ; only when used outside they are actually
lgpl....
also most of the files in question are header files where LGPL actually
makes sense when those same headers are used in userspace...
so how about not changing anything since there is no  need to change..
