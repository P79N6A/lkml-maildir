What's do special about i386?

It should be obvious from name whether function returns int which is a
boolean or int which is a number.

  -Why we wouldn't want it
  -C++ and Java fans will treat bool as a green light to the following
	if (!(flags == true))
  and
	if (!(flags == false))

Please, show compiler flag[s] to enable warning[s] from gcc about
	_Bool foo = 42;
Until you do that the whole activity is moot.

The only chunk that looks OK to me.

Why unsigned char? Why not unsigned int? What would this do wrt
bitfields?

What is it?
