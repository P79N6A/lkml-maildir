I did too.  I know the distributors (including the one I work for) want
it, but its a big change and very much a 2.5 thing.
I would not be against tuning the 2.4 scheduler, though.  But the 
changes to architecture-dependent code mean it may not even work on one
or two architectures (i.e. cris, maybe?) and so I am against the whole
O(1) scheduler and all of that supporting code for 2.4 proper.
