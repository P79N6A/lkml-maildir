Sorry for the late response (I've been away); "required" is perhaps
putting it strongly, because as you say the information is there,
somewhere. However, it would be nice to have, as standardized, that
the third argument to the sa_sigaction handler be castable to a
ucontext_t, as this would make porting signal-handling code between
Linux flavours much easier.
Cheers,
Christophe
