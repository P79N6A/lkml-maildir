Ok, I lost it, and let two weeks pass between -rc releases. My bad.
As a result, -rc4 is a bit bigger than it would/should have been, but 
hopefully it's all good, and we've fixed most regressions. There's some 
arch updates (MIPS, power, sparc64, s390) and an ACPI update, but the 
rest of it is mainly lots of small fixes (mostly to various random 
drivers). With some scheduler and networking noise.
I think the shortlog is _just_ too big to be posted on the kernel mailing 
list, but since it can mostly be described with the one word "boring", 
it's not a huge loss. As usual, just do
	git shortlog v2.6.23-rc3..v2.6.23-rc4
if you have the git trees to get the all the details on extraneous 
semicolons, missed or duplicate include files, kzalloc conversions, new 
PCI ID's etc etc.
