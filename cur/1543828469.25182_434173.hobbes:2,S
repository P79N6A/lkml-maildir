Well, as far as I know the only filesystems today that would need to
do something different are xfs, ocfs2, and reiserfs, and IMHO only the
first two have any kind of justification for doing it.  Part of the
problem is what st_blksize actually means was never well-defined; it
was never in POSIX, and in SuSv3 all that is stated is, "A file
system-specific preferred I/O block size for this object."  This is
why Reiserfs got away with specifying 128 megs (I assume it helped on
some benchmark), and why being ill-defined, using such a large value
might cause some applications (like /bin/cp) to core dump.   
Given that most filesystems use the generic page cache read/write
functions, using PAGE_CACHE_SIZE as the default seems to make a huge
amount of sense.  I really wonder how useful setting st_blksize really
is, actually, at least in the real-world, as opposed to just for
benchmarks.
