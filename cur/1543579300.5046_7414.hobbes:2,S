Hey, it's not the first, some time ago when it began to be reported a
lot of people with various systems asked at the same time about the same
thing :)
I have a dual p200mmx in a Gigabyte 586DX mobo with 96Mb + Voodoo 3
2000pci, Realtek 8139 nic, bt848 tv...
And I usually get a lot of these messages:
[coma@quartz coma]$ cat /proc/interrupts

but my system works ok, mostly, now I have just upgraded a Realtek 8029
(10Mb) because it gets hung to a Realtek 8139 (100Mb) just to found the
mobo has some kind of busmastering problems, but that's another story.
P.D. And as you suggested it runs very hot, about 50ºC at the cpus when
both are at full use.
