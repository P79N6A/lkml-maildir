Hello,
I would like to have my network interfaces configured when plugged on the 
network cable. I know there are some daemons that do this for me (laptop-net, 
ifplugd, whereami), but it would be nice if a simple udev rule take care of 
this to me. However, as I can see with kernel 2.6.16 and udevmonitor (udev 
version 0.091), nonetheless /sys/class/net/eth?/carrier changes when I plug 
the network cable, no uevent is generated. Could this be changed so udev get 
triggered when network cables get plugged? As I am no kernel developper, this 
is only a suggestion, hoping that it would be a simple and pertinent job for 
those ho know the subject.
Thanks in advance,
João.
