At this point, you're not going to get any slack.  If this is what you'd 
done to start with, you might have gotten away with it.  As it stands, 
you appear to be unwilling to comply with the rules, except as a last 
resort when you've been flamed for days.
I think what you need to do right now is do a lot of begging.  I agree 
that in principle, it's only technically necessary to have one of the 
modules taint the kernel.  But it's still "bad" to lie about the module 
license and should only be done after much scrutiny and discussion.
So if everyone who has a stake in this agrees to let you do it, then go 
ahead.  Otherwise, sorry Charley, but you're SOL.
