yeah, it looks a bit suspicious: you create a +1 second timeout out of a 
1 second resolution timesource. I dont yet understand the failure mode 
though that results in that looping and in the 30% CPU time use - do you 
understand it perhaps? (and automount is still functional while this is 
happening, correct?)
