Ok, I can buy that. Not having to initialize explicitly would be nice, but
if so we should make module loading do it automatically too, so that we
don't generate unnecessary differences between module and compiled in (ie
I'd rather avoid the situation that "if you're a module, you need to
explicitly export your inter_module_stuff(), while if you're compiled-in
it will be exported automatically").
