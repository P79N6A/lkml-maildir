You can use that argument to set the CPU limit low too -- since a kernel
with a CPU limit lower than the number of CPUs in the box will just ignore
the additional ones, people who want to get the additional performance
will tune limits that are set lower than they need ;-)

I bet the number of 32-way+ boxes is lost in the noise compared to the
number of 1-, 2- and 4-way boxes sold.  Not that HP trust me with that
kind of sales data ;-)
