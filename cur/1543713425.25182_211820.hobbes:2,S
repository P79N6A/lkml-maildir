I don't like the list idea.  Having the extra cowid (I prefer inode)
indirection costs a few bytes and one lookup, not much.  The list is
way too much overhead to get rid of so little in a few cases.
If you really want to, create a new syscall foldfile() that will
remove the indirection for one file, if possible.  Then userspace can
do the ugly work of scanning for single-linked cowids (or just leave
it).
