Well, actually my patch just waited on the _previous_ transaction to commit
(which can be done anywhere without retrying the operation) and then set
h_sync on the _current_ transaction so that as soon as the current operations
are completed it will also be committed and the blocks released.  One can't
of course arbitrarily call journal_stop() or that breaks the transaction
atomicity.
For 99.9% of cases this should be sufficient and doesn't involve changing
the code everywhere - only in ext3_new_block().  Also, Ted's approach
of retrying the operations "outside" the transaction won't work if there
are nested journal transactions being done - those will hold the transaction
open so doing journal_stop/journal_start doesn't really accomplish anything.
Cheers, Andreas
