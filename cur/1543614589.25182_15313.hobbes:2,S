just a sidenote:
Patches cc'd to linux-kernel instead of just to Alan/Marcelo/Linus are
also far more likely to be 'rediscovered' sometime, bringing up
"why wasn't this merged?" mails when perhaps the time is better for
$maintainer to merge.
I spent post-xmas-lunch going through backlogged l-k mails, and found
a bunch of patches that fix small problems that never got merged.
(These bits ended up in -dj6, and what will be -dj7 btw, and will get
pushed to the relevant people soon.)
Note however, xmas comes but once a year, so someone else can pick
up the silently ignored stuff next time 8-)
Dave.
