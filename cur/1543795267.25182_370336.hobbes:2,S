Subject: [PATCH 0/3] move swiotlb.h header file to common code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/23/549

This patchset does two things:
- creates an asm-generic/swiotlb.h header file and makes x86-64 and
IA64 both use it.
- makes swiotlb use 'enum dma_direction_dir' instead of 'int dir',
which is the right thing to according to the the DMA API, and updates
x86-64 and  ia64 accordingly. The code should be completely
equivalent. Compile tested on x86-64 and IA64.
This is the first step towards having a common IOMMU
infrastructure. Unfortunatly applying any of the patches require the
other two. It was posted to lkml a few days ago and there were no
comments.
Please apply.
Cheers,
Muli
