Do I understand correctly that swsusp requires drivers for primary swap to be 
compiled in kernel? It appears that initrd-based implementation is possible 
(load drivers for resume partition and then attempt to do manual resume via 
"echo x:y > /sys/power/resume") - are there any issues associated with it?
TIA
