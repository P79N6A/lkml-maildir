Pavel, this warning isn't even going to print on any of your systems.
So it's completely different than the straw-man you're proposing (that
I snipped).
Look, if you want to argue that the stars should go away, then sure,
I'm not going to stop you. But panicking over a BIOS misconfiguration
issue? One that can be corrected by the kernel? That's just plain
stupid.
