Subject: [PATCH RT] fix faulting bomb in futex_unlock_pi64

[CC'ing Uli because John forgot to with the original patch]
As John found with futex_unlock_pi (which that patch should apply nicely
to the -rt tree), the code can get screwed up with faulting in at the
cmpxchg in futex_unlock_pi code.
>From John's original email:
----
In looking into why the kernel was returning -EFAULT, I found the
following:
...
retry_locked:
        /*
         * To avoid races, try to do the TID -> 0 atomic transition
         * again. If it succeeds then we can return without waking
         * anyone else up:
         */
        if (!(uval & FUTEX_OWNER_DIED)) {
                pagefault_disable();
                uval = futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic(uaddr,
current->pid, 0);
                pagefault_enable();
        }
        if (unlikely(uval == -EFAULT))
                goto pi_faulted;
...[snip]...
pi_faulted:
        /*
         * We have to r/w  *(int __user *)uaddr, but we can't modify it
         * non-atomically.  Therefore, if get_user below is not
         * enough, we need to handle the fault ourselves, while
         * still holding the mmap_sem.
         */
        if (attempt++) {
                ret = futex_handle_fault((unsigned long)uaddr, fshared,
                                         attempt);
                if (ret)
                        goto out_unlock;
                goto retry_locked;
        }
----
We see that uval is -EFAULT when jumping to pi_faulted. But when it goes
back to retry_locked, the uval is still -EFAULT. Which just happens to
have the FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit set.  So we don't do the
futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic call, and go to the next conditional which
just so happens to be a check of uval for -EFAULT. And guess what? it
still is!!
Way to go John in finding this!!
But, the -rt kernel has pretty much the same code for the
futex_unlock_pi64, and it has the same bug. Hence this email.
This patch is the same fix that John posted, but simply for the
futex_unlock_pi64 that exists in the RT kernel and not the mainline.
