Ah, well, I don't understand why, but that's probably just
me being ignorant. It happens from time to time.

Ok, I can buy that it doesn't fit in with the current protocol
mindset, and that I for one have not demonstrated that it can
be. I remember how upset the IETF got over the original CIPSO
proposal not specifying which label tag value coresponded to
"Top Secret".

But ... I don't have a job. You're being mean. (smiley)
I think that we have a conflict between what works well for
a filesystem (xattrs are really helpful) and what works well
for a network protocol (undefined blobs of goo are atrocious)
in the case of a network file system. From either standpoint
the other is completely unworkable.
It may be the case that for NFS the proposed scheme (delta
LSM naming propriety, which is getting addressed) is the
best we can do. NFS is an old protocol (older than some of
the people reading this) and should be excused some shortcomings.
Thank you.
