You don't need to reboot for most of the above.
1.  inetd will notice any changes to inetd.conf automaticlly.
2.  /etc/host changes will be noticed instantly, ie whenever you
call gethostbyname() or whatever.
We had one linux box that stayed up beyond 400 days, and only went
down a couple of months ago when our building power transformer was
burned up by a water short...

why would you want to run fsck on a running system?  The purpose of
that is to catch errors caused by improper rebooting (such as hitting
the power/reset button rather than a normal shutdown). But yes, you
can umount the partition, fsck it if it makes you feel better, then
remount it without any problem, although I see no reason to do so.
We run to large linux file servers, supporting a couple of hundred
NFS clients, and we have zero file corruption and do not reboot every
week.  We don't even reboot every month...

yes...  but only if the system reboots ungracefully.  just like
linux.  No reason to fsck on a machine that is up and running unless
you have disk drive hardware problems, or controller hardware problems.
And then you are going down anyway to replace parts (unless you use hot-
swap drives).
