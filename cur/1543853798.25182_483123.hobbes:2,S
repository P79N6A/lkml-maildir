Hm, there is garbage in this node data. Moreover, your full logs show
that there was never another node added besides the host node. IOW the
second "Node removed" line shouldn't be there. Very strange.

Could you also test one or even better both of:
 - 2.6.19-rc5 plus
http://me.in-berlin.de/~s5r6/linux1394/updates/2.6.19-rc5/2.6.19-rc5_ieee1394_v204_experimental.patch.bz2
(these are the same FireWire drivers as in -rc5-mm2)
and/ or
 - 2.6.19-rc5-mm2 minus
http://www.it.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.19-rc5/2.6.19-rc5-mm2/broken-out/git-ieee1394.patch
Thanks so far,
