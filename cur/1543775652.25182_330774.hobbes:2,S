Don't ask me how this plays with the dcache.

The opposite of "local" is "remote", i.e. networked filesystems:
	mount foo:/bar /usr/src/bar
/, /usr and /usr/src are stored on a local disk. /usr/src/bar/* is not.
Namespace invariance can be guaranteed for the "/usr/src" part. Not for
anything below unless you control the peer.

ok, I just remembered that any process with an open directory handle
could still fchdir() underneath. I think the leaf node enforcing is
possible but it is indeed a bit more complicated.
(Hmm, it's a bit bizarre but could you mount FUSE on, for example, a
 named pipe and change it into a directory?)

It should be possible to do audits on local filesystems, e.g. by:
	find / /home /var -xdev ....
This can be done as root but sometimes you may want to do this with the
uid/gid of a specific user, for safety or for checking what the user
actually can access or damage. And that won't work as expected when the
user places a FUSE mount on top of his own login directory. But I don't
think leaf node enforcing is required from a security point of view. This
is the only thing I could come up with.
IMHO The namespace argument against FUSE is weak for multiple reasons. The
only variancy I see is when crossing the mount point. And that disappears
once EACCES is returned when non-ptraceable processes try to cross it.
But that's not really acceptable (see previous audit case) unless FUSE
refuses to mount on non-leaf dirs.
