Whoa...not so fast.  That banshee driver is an X server
not Banshee glide...that's Darryl Strauss's work, not
Creative's.   Glide for Voodoo3/Voodoo Banshee isnt done yet,
almost, but not quite.
(Strauss reports that it's "compiled and together execept for
X server interaction"...which isnt necessarily trivial)
There already was a Voodoo Banshee X server (on Darryl Strauss'
page), and it's better and supports more acceleration than
Creative's version.
