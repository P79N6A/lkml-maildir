I look forward to kernel.org getting better again. Is the source for 
diffview.cgi available anywhere on the web so that I can run it locally? 
diffview is the only reason I use the main kernel.org site anymore, 
since it seems to be the best way to view a whole patch at a glance that 
I have found.
