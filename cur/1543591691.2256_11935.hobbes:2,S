exec 3>/dev/ttyS0/ioctl
exec 4<&3
echo "speed" >&3
cat <&4

exec 4<&-
Can you make a counter example where this doesn't look good?

I'd prefer to make what you often call a crapectomy: no IDE timing
change using a partition handle. It's something like to permit that on a
LVM handle, it's stupid...
About tty and vcs split: there the problem is more subtle and it's
related to a missing separation of keyboard and screen.
After to have done this choice (i.e. to have the some behaviour of
serial port) someone has realized that to read from console screen it's
a sensible action (to fetch current content).
This is the typical case where to have /dev/tty1/ioctl does not
substitute to have another device for console screen reading.
Note that it's a *different* device (different permission, etc.).
