Note.  When a signal goes to a process group (or similar) we can't fix
si_pid at the source.  We have to fix it when only a single destination
process is known.  It doesn't mean that fixing it at the source
is hopeless but...

Yes.  I don't think si_pid is valid in that case anyway.  It is the
kernel signals where si_pid is a reliable field that are important.
