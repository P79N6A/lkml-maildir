  Applying patches.
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - In 2.4 and previous kernels, the recommended way to apply patches was
    to use a command line such as ...
    gzip -cd patchXX.gz | patch -p0
    In 2.6, Linus started adding an extra path element to the diffs,
    so using -p1 in the untarred 'to be patched' directory is necessary.
+Release Candidates
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+- In 2.4 and previous kernels, -rc meant "release candidate".
+  In 2.6, -rc means "really churning", so even more testing is desired.
+
  Known gotchas.
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Certain known bugs are being reported over and over. Here are the
  workarounds.
  - Blank screen after decompressing kernel?
    Make sure your .config has
     CONFIG_INPUT=y
     CONFIG_VT=y
