Howdy,
MySQL 5.0.26 had some scalability issues and it solved since 5.0.32
http://ossipedia.ipa.go.jp/capacity/EV0612260303/
(written in Japanese but you may read the graph. We compared
5.0.24 vs 5.0.32)
The following is oprofile data
==> cpu=8-mysql=5.0.32-gcc=3.4/oprofile-eu=2200-op=default-none/opreport-l.txt
<==
CPU: Core Solo / Duo, speed 2666.76 MHz (estimated)
Counted CPU_CLK_UNHALTED events (Unhalted clock cycles) with a unit
mask of 0x00 (Unhalted core cycles) count 100000
samples  %        app name                 symbol name

19636300  7.0207  libpthread-2.3.4.so      pthread_mutex_unlock
18600010  6.6502  mysqld                   rec_get_offsets_func
18121328  6.4790  mysqld                   btr_search_guess_on_hash

MySQL tries to get a mutex but it spends about 16.8% of CPU on 8 core
machine.
I think there are a lot of room to be inproved in MySQL implementation.
