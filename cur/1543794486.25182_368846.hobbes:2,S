if it needs to be loaded with a parameter you will need to build it as a
module.. my saa7134 chip needs card=9.
i am experiencing same problems with saa7134, no video, however i do get

this is a way to (incorrectly according to v4l devs) "fix" it:
drivers/media/video/video-buf.c
change line 1233 to this:
        vma->vm_flags |= VM_DONTEXPAND;
