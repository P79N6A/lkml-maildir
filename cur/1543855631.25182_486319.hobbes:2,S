There are subtle difference in the way two function can be used.  They
are operating in two different environments. absent_pages work when
memory layout is already registered.  The e820_hole_size is the (low
level arch dependent) function that will be used to find out how the
memory lay out is going to be set for the cases when kernel has to
itself decide about the layout.
