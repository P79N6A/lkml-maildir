   nice,1002 lines of code in df.c.. okay, let's have a look into it...
   (currently I think it _could_ be a kernel bug, so I will pass this message
   alon to lkml)
There is no reason why you should read all of df.c, you can use the
GNU Debugger and see what is going on quickly.  Possible places to set
break points might be in [coreutils]/src/df.c:show_dev and/or
[coreutils]/lib/fsusage.c:get_fs_usage.
