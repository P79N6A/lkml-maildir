Hm, are you sure you applied them and are using that kernel?  :)
/sys/class should look something like this:
$ tree /sys/class/
/sys/class/
|-- cpu
|   `-- cpu0
|       |-- device -> ../../../devices/sys/cpu0
|       `-- foo
|-- input
`-- tty
    |-- console0
    |   `-- dev
    |-- ptmx0
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pts0
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pts1
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pts2
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pts3
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pts4
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pts5
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pts6
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pts7
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pty0
    |   `-- dev
    |-- pty1
    |   `-- dev
... and so on...
thanks,
