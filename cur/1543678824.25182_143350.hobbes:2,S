You may be, I am not.

Yeah, yeah. I know, get off it. They are the same.

What are those packages you are talking about? I am not making a
distribution.

So where are all the libc packages for each and every kernel package
in debian?

No, it's how a linux distribution may work ( or should I say a
GNU/Linux distribution).

Yes, that's why it's called the unstable branch. You are talking about a ready
all done distribution. I am not. I am talking about developement. I
don't know what your problem is. If you want the app in your
distribution then change it to the way you want.
Fact is that you need the headers in the kernel, in order to compile
the drivers.
Fact is that I need those same headers for my applications, not some
others somewhere else.
Fact is that this is the kernel list and we are talking about a
developement kernel.
All you are talking about is some user who gets a distribution and
wants to compile his own programs. But they don't use DEVELOPEMENT
kernels. And the don't write low level apps to test the drivers.
Get over it, I am done feeding the trolls.
