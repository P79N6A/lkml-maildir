Fedora takes whatever defaults for readahead the kernel.org kernel has.
The only reasoning being if anyone reported VM bugs, we'd be able
to say to interested upstream developers "we're running the stock VM".
without having to get the user to try and reproduce on unpatched
kernels.

It's not a subject that I'm intimatly familiar with, and when it
comes to decisions like this, I tend to just take whatever the
upstream defaults are.
