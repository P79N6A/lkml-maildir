There are bugs in the core VM and block filesystem code where !uptodate pages
are left in pagetables. Some of these are fixed in -mm.
But they aren't a good reason to invent completely different ways to do things.

It means that Dave's page_mkwrite function will do the block allocation
and everything else continues as it is. Your suggested change to pass in
offset == to is just completely wrong for this.
PG_uptodate being unset should be done via pagecache invalidation or truncation
APIs, which (sometimes... modulo bugs) tear down pagetables first.
