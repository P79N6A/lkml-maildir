        I do not know if this problem is reported already,
    since i read lkml thru web-archive, with accompanying
update delays.
    2.4.8 dies after ~1/2 minute of mpg123 playback,
    with tty switching freeze, and typing out 
    continuously (i`d say infinitely) call trace.
        ac7 acts this way too, but before death
    sound stalls *some* times, i then each time restart
    the proggie which emits it. This pattern survives
    4-5 stalls, after which - final trace dump.
    gcc-2.95.3, sb16 - genuine, vanilla ac7, vanilla 
    2.4.8.
    further information upon request.

cheers,
