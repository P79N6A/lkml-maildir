Hi,
I was just wondering what the status of development is in regard to  
support for the Marvell 88SE6141 (ie. mv61xx) SATA-II controller is?   
This particular controller is included on the Asus P5WD2-E Premium  
motherboard.
I checked the mailing list archives, linux-ata.org, and also grepped  
through drivers/scsi/sata_mv.c in the 2.6.16 source (and the latest  
2.6.17 patches), but I could not find any mention of this particular  
chipset anywhere, so I'm hoping that this isn't a redundant question.
Thanks,
	Gord
