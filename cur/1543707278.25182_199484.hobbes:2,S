OK, thanks.  That would be appreciated, if only because the sched.c and
entry.S changes have caused significant patch-conflict hassles in the past,
and they're pretty ugly.
Plus the little fact that the patch which you sent broke all other
architectures: they call schedule() from assembly code, and schedule()
ain't there any more.
I'll have a play with the patches which you sent, and if they don't break
I'll add them to -mm and I'll kludgily fix ppc64 and ia64 (if needed).  Be
aware that I removed the (large amount of) trailing whitespace which they
added.
