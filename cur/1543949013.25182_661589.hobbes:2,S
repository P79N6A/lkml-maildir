Things have cleared a bit. First, my problem is with printing to console.
Second, the date-time-host header is only appended when using loglevel
KERN_DEBUG. Third, the <n> tag is only appended to the beginning of the printk
printout if the last printout did not end with a '\n'. The whole printk code is
quite confuscated IMO, not the least so call_console_drivers(), so this could be
a feature, however it looks to me like the loglevel tag is for internal use and
my guess is it should never be printed on the console at all.
I'll look into filing a bug report and patch for this. At the moment the best
solution seems to be to search through the log I want to print and cut the
printout after every '\n'. That should take care of most of the "<n>"'s.
