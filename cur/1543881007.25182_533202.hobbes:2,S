Then I'll dare suggest arch/cris - the second and last arch implementing 
this API - has the same problem. Maintainer added to cc:, patch below.

Well, this API seems to have a bigger problem: it is difficult to get to 
SoC/bus-local memory from several child devices. Even if I do implement 
that DMA_MEMORY_INCLUDES_CHILDREN flag, 1) you do not always have the 
desired device as your immediate parent, 2) you have to ref-count it. For 
example, I was trying to use SoC-local SRAM on PXA270 from the 
framebuffer, but fb-devices on PXA are either platform devices, or 
sometimes get other parents. So, looks like another way to get to the SoC 
node is needed...
Thanks

Fix dma_declare_coherent_memory wrong allocation for cris/arch-v32
    
arch/cris/arch-v32 seems to have copy-pasted the bug from arch/i386 fixed 
with an earlier patch - allocate bitmap in bytes, not words.
