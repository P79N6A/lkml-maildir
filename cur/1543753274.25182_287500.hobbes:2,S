Oh, I guess my English must be really bad.
I was talking about seperation of layers, so why do I need
kernelhooks ? 
The seperation of layers makes it possible to actually reuse
functionality and gives the possibility that existing hardwired stuff
can be cleaned up to use the new functionality too. 
If we add another hardwired implementation then we do not have said
benefits.
