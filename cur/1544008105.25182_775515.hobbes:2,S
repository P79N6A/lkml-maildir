Thanks for the pointer.  Yes something like that.

No, the plan is to cache it in the struct file of the topmost
directory.  This should also solve the lseek() issue.
The only concern is that this caching behavior can waste unswappable
kernel memory.  But unless some malicious application actually wants
to exploit this, I don't think it will be a big issue in practice.
