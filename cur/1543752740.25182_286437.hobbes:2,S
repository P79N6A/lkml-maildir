most audio hackers and users are perfectly comfortable with the OSX
compromise - tasks with no special privilege get deterministic access
to the CPU as long as they do not consume excessive cycles.
this begs the question about what happens when the entire class of
SCHED_ISO (to use Con's working name for such a scheduling class)
tasks is eating too much CPU, rather than any one of them, but i'll
leave that to Con :)
