I guess then we should drop ZONE_DMA (its a misnoner anyways since it 
seems to indicate that DMA is only possible in this zone). Instead use
ZONE_ISA_DMA		-> ISA DMA Area (16 MB boundary)
ZONE_32BIT_DMA		-> 32bit DMA area (well 900 MB on x86_64 but somewhere in that area)
			only used for 64 bit platforms with 32 bit devices.
<and maybe define new ones in the future?>
Some arches seem to make ZONE_DMA their default zone instead of 
ZONE_NORMAL if DMA is possible to all of memory. I think in that case we 
should have no ZONE_DMA at all.
