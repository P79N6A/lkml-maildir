	Why have a database of devices?  The user-space daemon is notified
when a device is added/removed, then all it has to do is create/remove (per
user option) the appropriate /dev entry.  You might have a config file that
is read in and stored as a database-like thing for handling permissions of
new devices and what devices should be allowed to be created/deleted 
on-the-fly, but when the system dies, a quick glance at what is in /dev can
probably tell you what all was in your system at the time.  
	Of course, if you don't know what was attached to your system when 
your system crashed, well, me thinks maybe there be other problems afoot. :)
