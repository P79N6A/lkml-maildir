Please do not abuse P2SEGADDR in this fashion. No new code should be
using P2SEGADDR anyways. maple is particularly abusive in this case since
it bounces back and forth between P2SEGADDR and PHYSADDR to try and
ignore the fact cache flushing has to be handled.
You may also wish to consider ioremap/ioremap_nocache().

printk() is pretty useless throughout all of this code, you have a struct
device, use it. dev_info()/dev_err()/etc/etc. with &mdev->dev will also
give you some meaningful indicator of which device in particular is
having issues.

All of these beyond the waitqueue initialization are superfluous, given
that you are kzalloc()'ing mdev in the first place.

This is not an improvement. There are many places throughout this code
where you have a perfectly usable errno value handed back to you that you
simply ignore in favour of a fixed error value. If you have an indicator
of what went wrong, it helps to pass that along in the error case,
especially if you are trying to debug an error.

&&'s at the end of the first line.

I find it rather entertaining that you have no qualms about using
ridiculously long device and driver names even with fancy caps yet can't
bring yourself to insert an _ in your function pointer names.
