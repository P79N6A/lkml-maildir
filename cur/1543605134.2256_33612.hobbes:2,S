Hi,
fuser -n [tcp|udp] no longer works with the Linux kernel 2.4.12.  No
processes are printed, even though ports are clearly being used.  It used
to work fine with 2.4.10, I don't know about 2.4.11.  fuser is version 19,
as found in RH 7.1 (psmisc-19-4).
I know nothing about kernel internals, so I can't pinpoint the exact
change.  However, I debugged fuser with gdb and what I found out is that
fuser expects the st_dev field of /proc/pid/fd/* to be 0 for sockets.  In
2.4.12 st_dev is 4, at least for TCP sockets, so fuser fails to match the
entries.
I don't know if it's fuser that makes invalid assumptions or if it is a
kernel bug.  I guess it's for you guys to decide.
If you reply, please include my e-mail address in Cc, as I'm not on the
kernel list.
Regards,
