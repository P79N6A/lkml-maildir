Actually clearing the memory can be done at full memory bandwidth
which can happen in seconds.  On systems with ECC you need initialize
all of the check bits so some kind of write to memory needs to happen.
In practice a reset does not clear the memory and only a few bits
tend to get flipped.  Unless you can get support from the
BIOS/firmware developers it isn't a practical approach though.

Does a kernel really need 64M?  That number seems insanely large
to me.  8M should be more than sufficient if someone actually
tried to be small.  If you are aiming for a dedicated hardware
solution you don't need even need a kernel in there and the
amount reserved could be reduced to less than a meg.
The size etc becomes a trade off between what is expedient
and maintainable.
