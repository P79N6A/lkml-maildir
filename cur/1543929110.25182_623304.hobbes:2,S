Wouldn't a natural extension of this feature be to mark these hung 
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE tasks with a new thread flag such as TIF_HUNG for the 
purposes of the OOM killer?
Right now, the OOM killer will become a no-op when any candidate task that 
it scans through is found to have the TIF_MEMDIE flag when selecting a 
task to kill.  So any hung task in this state could cause the OOM killer 
to infinitely loop.
If lockdep could set_tsk_thread_flag(g, TIF_HUNG), this could be detected 
in the OOM killer and not only could we prevent the infinite looping but 
we could also clear TIF_MEMDIE and reduce the increased timeslice that the 
OOM killer gives to the tasks it kills.
