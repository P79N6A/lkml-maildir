Subject: [GIT PATCH] 2 small Driver core fixes for 2.6.12-git
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's two patches that fixes some oopses with the USB code due to a
change in the driver core (could also cause problems with other
subsystems, just happened to notice it in the USB code.)  Many thanks to
Stelian Pop for noticing this and figuring out the fix for it.
Please pull from:

or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:

thanks,
