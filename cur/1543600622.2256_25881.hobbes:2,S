That would not work with local mail submissions.  Mail may arrive
via channels other than SMTP, yet use addressing methods according
to Internet standards.
I thank those who made useful suggestions.
I apologize to those who mis-understood my question as a request
to have kernel programmers explain me the mail RFC standards.
I can RTFM the mail RFC standards just fine.
The other folks need to grow up a bit.
Over and out.
