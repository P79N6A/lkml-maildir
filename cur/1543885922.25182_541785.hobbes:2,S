There is a difference between "u64" and "__u64", so don't confuse the
two, they are used for different things.
Same thing for your typedef above, you are confusing the usage of these
types of variables, please do not do that.
In short, if the variable is going to cross the userspace/kernelspace
boundry, use the "__" version, otherwise use the non-"--" version.
And please don't use uint64_t in the kernel, I don't want to see that
long flame-war again, read the archives for why those kinds of types
don't matter for us in the kernel tree.
So please drop all typedefs from your filesystem, you should not be
creating any new ones, that's the incorrect style guidelines.
thanks,
