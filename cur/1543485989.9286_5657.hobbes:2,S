It's not really an ld.so problem.  All the binaries currently running on your 
system will have libc.so and other libraries mmap'd.  If you install a new 
copy of libc.so on top of the old one, without either deleting or moving the 
old library out of the way, the effect will be that these running programs end 
up with a random mixture of pages from the old and new libraries.  This 
internal inconsistency is what leads to the crash.  If you get a crash during 
installation of libc your system can be left in an inconsistent state and 
quite possibly this will mean that no binaries at all will run.
By either deleting or moving libc.so.6 prior to installation you ensure that 
currently-running programs retain an intact copy of the old library; new 
programs will get the new library (also hopefully intact) and everybody is 
happy.
