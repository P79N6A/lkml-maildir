I'd like the the CPU hotremove case just likes the case that CPU isn't
boot. A non-boot CPU hasn't a idle thread. But you may think it's not
worthy doing. Anyway, I will keep the idle thread in a updated patch
like what you said.

Keeping some fields like 'cpu_load' are meanless for a hotadded CPU to
me. Just ignore them?
