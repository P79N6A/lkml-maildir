If setpluid(pid, luid) exists, then this is more easy to handle.

Hmm... from what I understand from the code, when the last resource in
the beancounter is dropped, the beancounter is destroyed. Which to me
means that when there are no tasks in a beancounter it will be
destroyed. (I just tested the code and verified that the beancounter is
destroyed when the task dies).
Please correct me if my understanding is incorrect.
Let me reword the requirement: beancounter/resource group should _not_
be destroyed implicitly. It should be destroyed only when requested by
the user/sysadmin. In other words, we need a create_luid() and
destroy_luid().
