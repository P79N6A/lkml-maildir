Hi-
It seems that the "pSeries reconfig" patch series which Paul sent on
March 17th to Andrew on my behalf was incompletely merged into bk?  It
looks like only the last two of the series are in -bk as of today
(2.6.12-rc1-mm1 has them all).
Subject lines and URLs for the series in question:
[PATCH 1/8] PPC64 preliminary changes to OF fixup functions
       
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/17/41
[PATCH 2/8] PPC64 make OF node fixup code usable at runtime

[PATCH 3/8] PPC64 introduce pSeries_reconfig.[ch]

[PATCH 4/8] PPC64 prom.c: use pSeries reconfig notifier
       
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/17/56
[PATCH 5/8] PPC64 pci_dn.c: use pSeries reconfig notifier
       
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/17/57
[PATCH 6/8] PPC64 pSeries_iommu.c: use pSeries reconfig notifier
       
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/17/54
[PATCH 7/8] PPC64 use pSeries reconfig notifier for cpu DLPAR
       
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/17/44
[PATCH 8/8] PPC64 make cpu hotplug play well with maxcpus and smt-enabled
       
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/17/55
With 2.6.12-rc1-bk1, if CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES and CONFIG_SMP are enabled,
the build errors out:
  CC      arch/ppc64/kernel/pSeries_smp.o
arch/ppc64/kernel/pSeries_smp.c:47:34: asm/pSeries_reconfig.h: No such
file or directory
If people would like something to use in the meantime, below is a
throwaway patch to work around the breakage (not intended for
inclusion).  Disabling CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES should work around it also.
The real fix is to either revert patches 7 and 8, or merge 1-6 :)
