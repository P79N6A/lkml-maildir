i'd love to have a oneliner solution :-)
wrt. signedness: note that in v2 i have made rq_running signed, and most 
calculations (especially those related to nice) are signed values. (On 
64-bit systems this all isnt a big issue - most of the arithmetics 
gymnastics in CFS are done to keep deltas within 32 bits, so that 
divisions and multiplications are sane.)
