ok, good. A series of questions:
- can you reproduce it from the VGA console?
- if yes, does booting with "nmi_watchdog=2 idle=poll" give you a 
  working NMI watchdog? (working NMI watchdog means the NMI counts 
  increase for all cores in /proc/interrupts).
if still 'yes', then try to reproduce the hard hang on the VGA text 
console - do you perhaps get an NMI backtrace printed within 1-2 minutes 
after the hard hang happens? If yes then take a photo of that or write 
it down.
