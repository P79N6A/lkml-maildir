The only problem is that this is a RETARDED precedent. __foo means the 
"internal" version of foo. Within the kernel __foo often means the version
of foo without "the lock".
POSIX defines any type beginning with _ as part of the implementation.
IMHO, no userspace app should *ever* need a type that starts with _ or __.
It's just dumb.  If the width matters, define it as a width specific type.
If it doesn't define it as an int/short/whatever.  The fact that it isn't
obvious what is or is not kernel-only is an entirely separate issue.

As much as uint8_t is a pain in the ass to type, at least it is clear and
obvious and standard, don't you think? :)
