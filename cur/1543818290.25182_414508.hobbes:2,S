Does not look like x86 asm code:
>        p = (char *) memmem(code, SCLEN, "\xff\x14\x85", 3);
call dword ptr [edx-...]
>        pt = (char *) memmem(p+7, SCLEN-(p-code)-7,
>                "\xc7\x44\x24\x18\xda\xff\xff\xff\xe8", 9);
mov dword ptr [esp+0x18], 0xffffffda
Nope, does not look meaningful if taken as x86 asm.
