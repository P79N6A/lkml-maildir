schedule() does prev->sleep_timestamp = jiffies; just before
deactivating prev.
so i guess inactivity is counted towards sleep_avg, too

but it _can_ use the 100ms at a time if it is cpu-bound
what's so bad about recalculating the quantum?

but most of the time, not _one_ process is waken up, but several at once
if it happens that the first who gets to run is cpu-bound,
then all other interactive processes have to wait a long time, even
if they would only need 1ms to finish their work.
scheduling overhead was successfully brought down to a minimum
thanks to the great work of a lot of people.
i think we should use that work to improve latency by reducing
the available timeslice for interactive processes.
if the process is still considered interactive after the time slice had run
out, nothing is lost; it simply gets another one.
but the kernel should get the chance to frequently reschedule
when interactivity is needed.

but it takes too long. 100ms is noticeable

i've read it ;)
