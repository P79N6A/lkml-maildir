With the array there's no need for any switch or branching.  You know 
exactly which function in the array to use in each hook.

There comes a point when trying to reuse existing code is less cost 
effective than starting over.

I think that will be less efficient than the function array.

Something like that.  It involved some tricky locking issues and was 
reasonably complex (which made providing it a good option when compared 
to each client implementing its own version).  Rather than trying to do 
this from scratch I'd advise getting a copy of the most recent PAGG 
patches and using that as a model as a fair bit of effort was spent 
ironing out all the problems involved.  It's not as easy as it sounds.
