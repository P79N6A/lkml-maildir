We shouldn't need this because extended config space should work
here and Linux should use it 
(especially after we added the ugly Barcelona workaround into  that code) 
The only exception would be if the user disables MMCONFIG in CONFIG, but that's
their own fault then.
Ok there might be buggy BIOS around with no or no usable MCFG table, but since
extended config space is not really a critical feature that's not a big issue.
So I don't think we want this special case code at all and should
just rely on MMCONFIG.
