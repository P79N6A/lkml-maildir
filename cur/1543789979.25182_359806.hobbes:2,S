OK...  I tried both debugfs and modules, and the modules approach turned
out to be much more tester-friendly.  With debugfs, one must do a special
build of the kernel to enable debugfs -- which will also include other
test code that might skew results -- and the fact that debugfs does not
yet seem to have a standard mount point makes scripting less effective.
In contrast, the modules approach can be used even on an already running
kernel that you did not plan to test ahead of time.
So modules it is.  Patch submitted separately.
							Thanx, Paul
