How feasible is it to create an mlock(1) utility, that would allow 
priveleged users to execute a daemon such that none of the memory the 
daemon allocates will ever be swapped out?
ntp daemon does mlock(2) internally, for example, but IMHO this is 
really a policy decision that could be moved out of the app.
Unfortunately I am VM-ignorant as always ;-)
