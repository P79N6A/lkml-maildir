the kdump kernel needs to access data on the SPUs on node 1. It might be
possible to change that so we can access the SPUs even if there is only
one node, but it's probably not easy to do.
In the future, we also may have configurations where we need to run with
memoryless nodes on a production environment, so it should really just
work.

What makes you assume that there is one page in the node? AFAICS, it
is a CPU-only node already without any pages.
