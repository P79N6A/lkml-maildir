And it hasn't been removed either. Only the output has been removed; the
data is still collected. Meanwhile I found the bug that leads to wrong
ios_in_flight values on SCSI systems:
The accounting was done on a copy of the request _after_ the request has
been dequeued and the irq_request_lock released. I fixed this by taking
this lock again while calling the accounting function (see the patch
below).
** This patch is relevant regardless where the statistics will finally
be printed. **
One issue is still left: on my non-SCSI machine, the ios_in_flight value
is at -1 when although requests are running. It doesn't get any more
wrong than that it seems, and I'm not sure where that happened. Maybe
something went wrong when initializing this value at boot time? I have a
workaround that corrects negative ios_in_flight values to zero each time
/proc/partitions is read. After further testing I will post it to the
list.
Bye
