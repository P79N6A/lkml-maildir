This may be caused by bug in i83265 pcmcia module which seems not to
have one release_region() call. It reserves region during init and
does not release it when it fails to probe for the hardware.
That driver is loaded in rc.pcmcia script during boot and usually
fails to load because You do not have such hardware (the script probes
for different pcmcia drivers).
During shutdown one of the shutdown scripts greps through
/proc/ioports file which causes an oops (reserverd region name points
to unloaded driver).
Attached patch is my second attempt to fix this bug :-)
Cheers,
Igor
