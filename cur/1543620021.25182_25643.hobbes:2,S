I looked at this point at some time, and I found that it made it a lot
easier to write code to permute memory arbitrarily, as may be required.
  The reason is that you really want to keep an array that's O(N) in the
size of memory to keep track of where things are, and in order to do that,
realistically, you need to have some reasonably large granularity -- 4K
pages are just about right.
Of course, maybe I was just using a dumb algorithm... :)
