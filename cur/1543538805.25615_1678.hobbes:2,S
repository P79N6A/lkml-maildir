Your example misses the point: you're doing "fclose(NULL)".
That has
  (a) nothing to do with the kernel -- the kernel isn't called at all.
  (c) nothing to do with sys_close() or close() in libc -- fclose()
      won't get as far as calling close().
  (b) nothing to do with "closing an unopened file" -- NULL isn't a
      file at all.
However if we fclose() a already closed file your point is illustrated:
  #include <errno.h>
  #include <stdio.h>
  FILE * new;
  int main ()
  {
    new = fopen ("/tmp/a_file", "w");
    if (new) {
      fclose (new);
      fclose (new); /* SEGV here */
    }
    return 0;
  }
Why does this happen?  Because fclose(new) calls free(new).  You're not
allowed to free() the same memory twice, and Glibc's memory allocator
knows this and optimises accordingly.
Why does it work on other unix systems?  Because some malloc/free
implementations let you do things like continue to access the most
recently freed block, free it twice, and realloc it.  Beware, that's far
from reliable everywhere, and it's not supported by the relevant
standards either.  As the implementation says:
    Because freed chunks may be overwritten with link fields, this
    malloc will often die when freed memory is overwritten by user
    programs.  This can be very effective (albeit in an annoying way)
    in helping track down dangling pointers.
By the way, your manual page reference is to close(2) which _will_
return EBADF for an already closed file descriptor.  That's quite
different to fclose(3).
have a nice day,
