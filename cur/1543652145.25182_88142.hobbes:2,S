But why do you expect to be able to mmap shared something you opened RW in
the first place, if the filesystem cannot handle writable m appings?

Ok, it's good to have tests, but it sounds like the test is broken.

Ad shipped, the kernel doesn't allow that.
Notice the pattern here? "As shipped". You have two choices: make 
gratuitous changes to the kernel to make some random test happy, or fix 
the test.
I think you should fix the test. The kernel change buys you _zero_ new 
features.
