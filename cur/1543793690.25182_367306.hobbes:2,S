A few suggestions;
You point to a lot of documents, but never mention the main kernel
README nor Documentation/Changes . I think you should.
The README provides good info on configuring, building and installing
the kernel and other bits that will be useful to new kernel
developers.
Similarly the Documentation/Changes document provides important info
on required versions of tools needed to build and/or use the kernel.
Making new developers aware of this info is important so they can
verify their environment is up-to-date for the kernel version they
work on.
