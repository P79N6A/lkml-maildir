One way to deal with that problem would be to create a very high priority 
queue which is reserved for very light weight tasks, and heavily protected 
against them going cpu hungry.  If a forking task has a run history worthy 
of trial, slip it straight into the high priority queue... and be prepared 
to beat it into submission should it misbehave (short term run_avg ever 
exceeds X, you're outta here buddy, and if this queue is consuming more 
than Y, sorry, we're closed).
Another way would be to factor task age into the priority calculation, with 
age becoming rapidly less important.  Xmms' audio threads are light weight, 
and will quickly be able to sustain their priority.  Others would 
(hopefully) rapidly fall down where they belong.
Just a couple random thoughts, both of which I can see problems with ;-)
