You already got the relevant part of the dmesg log. Slightly more below.
I think the filesystem can be treated both as iso9660 and as udf,
at least that is what I seem to recall CD-BRIDGE means.  Thus,
if the kernel cannot mount it as udf, I think it is a kernel flaw.
Given that kernel flaw, and the fact that mounting as iso9660 works,
mount(8) could work around the kernel problem by guessing iso9660.
But maybe we should first try to fix the kernel.
