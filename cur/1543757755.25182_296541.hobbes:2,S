Let's take a first baby step and make the congestion control
algorithm a single enumeration instead of all of this
tp->foo_cong_ctrl_on, tp->bar_cong_ctrl_on stuff.  Then make
the union to shrink the tcp_sock size, we could even use an
anonymous union to make the patch a lot smaller.
We can't just get rid of all the existing sysctls.  We can
add a new one that just makes the choice as you describe.
We could therefore do something like this:
enum tcp_congctrl_alg tcp_global_congctrl_alg;
And then we use a special sysctl handler for all the individual
sysctl_tcp_bic et al. enablers that does something like:
	if (tcp_global_congctrl_alg == TCP_CONGCTRL_BIC)
		return 1;
	return 0;
and setting just does the necessary assignment to
tcp_global_congctrl_alg.  Well... I hope the sysctl framework
allows something like this :-)  If not, it should not be hard to
add.
