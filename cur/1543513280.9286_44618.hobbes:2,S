For most RS485 hardware, and most radio hardware it basically comes down to
	TIOCMBITSENDING
		modem bits when sending
		udelay start
		udelay end
The end one is a real pain on the 16x50 chips because there is no last bit
exited the fifo IRQ. For the scarab radio modems I jus write an extra byte
to avoid that one.
