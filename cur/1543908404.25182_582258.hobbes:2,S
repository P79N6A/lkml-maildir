If that's what worries you, add a comment next to the definition,
perhaps?
It's there so you can easily locate all the places within dm that
perform these conversions by using a simple search.  Searching for '9'
wouldn't be as easy.  (I don't know about other people, but I find the
code easier to read the way it is.)
BTW When changing one thing across the whole of dm, you may combine
the sub-component patches into a single patch.
