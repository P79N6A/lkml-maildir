I know the standard _allows_ us to crash and burn (well, corrupt
f_pos) when two threads race on an fd, but why would we want to?
Wouldn't it be better to do something at least slightly sane, like add
atomically to f_pos the expected number of number of bytes written,
then do the write, then fix it up (again atomically) if vfs_write
returns an unexpected pos?

Is it?  How?
