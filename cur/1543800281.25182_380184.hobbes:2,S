I'm not getting the point:
Shouldn't "static" versus not "static" already give gcc everything it 
needs for making the decision?
If stuff is cross-module (more exactly: cross-objects) it's not static 
and I doubt there are many (if any) cases of non-static code we want 
inline'd when used inside the file it's in.
