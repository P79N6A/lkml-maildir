Hi Christoph,
I'm sure it was me who suggested putting intel_menlo.c under drivers/misc.
A while back I refused to let any new platform specific drivers under
drivers/acpi, and asked that the ones here already move out.
This is because they happne to use ACPI, but are not actually
part of the ACPI sub-system (any more than ATA is).
Also, I wanted the maintainer roles to be clear -- these
drivers have primary maintainers other than me, and those
guys are in the heroic, but tragic, business of writing
platform-specific drivers for systems with no documentation or vendor support.
drivers/misc/asus-laptop.c
drivers/misc/fujitsu-laptop.c
drivers/misc/msi-laptop.c
drivers/misc/sony-laptop.c
drivers/misc/thinkpad_acpi.c
drivers/misc/sony-laptop.c
intel_menlo.c fits in with this group, the only difference is that
its primary maintainers actually have documentation:-)
is there a better place than drivers/misc for this group?
thanks,
-Len
