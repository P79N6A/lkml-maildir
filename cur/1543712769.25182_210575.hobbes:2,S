You seem to be correct. It looks like the flags member was added to all
i2c structures, but for adapters it was left unused.

Why would an adapter want to accept non-matching clients once we will have
added a clean isolation method?

The flags could be renamed if needed. There's at least one flag that we
already planed to rename (I2C_ADAP_CLASS_SMBUS, because the "SMBUS" part
is a misnomer - a more correct term would be HWMON or SENSORS).

My initial approach was different. I wouldn't have introduced a new
flag. Instead I would have defined a "neutral" class I2C_ADAP_CLASS_ANY
0xFFFF, suitable for chips that can belong to any bus (such as
eeprom.c). This same value could be used for busses that don't care
about which chips are connected to it (i2c-parport comes to mind). No
flag needed.
Finding whether a chip and an adapter match is as easy as checking if
((chip->class & adapter->class) != 0).

This is where your approach looks slightly better than mine. With my
method, backward compatibility isn't provided. However, fixing existing
drivers would be rather easy, and I share Greg KH's view that drivers
living outside the kernel tree get the pain they deserve.
My main point is that if we start defining classes for both chips and
adapters and go on using them, we better consider it a policy and do it
consistently, or it will probably look confusing to newcomers.

I guess you mean "against busses of class I2C_ADAP_CLASS_TV_ANALOG,
amongst which is the MXB saa7146 bus"? Or I just lost you.

I just tested. You can comment it out in the definition of i2c_adapter,
and everything still compiles without a complaint. I guess it means you
get a point.

I would say yes, but I'm not the authority.
