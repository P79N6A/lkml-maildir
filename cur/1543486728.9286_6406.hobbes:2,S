drivers/fc4 aims to be that layer. If you look into vger CVS, there is an
update to drivers/fc4, which adds another FC card and FC-AL topology
support, ie. what will you see in most cases.
If you mean those #ifdef __sparc__ in the code, then don't worry. That's a
workaround for severe deficiency in Linux generic bus layer, and myself and
Martin Mares intend to rewrite that layer so that all those ifdefs will
simply disappear.

fc4 should contain generic fibre channel support and then support for
different protocols, like FCP SCSI, HIPPI, IP over FC, etc., so we should
not limit ourselves to SCSI.
Please take what's in vger (or tell me and I'll send you patch) and tell me
what you miss for your card there and I'll work with you on fixing it.
The layer was just written with knowledge about just two different host
adaptors, but once it will support more devices, I hope it will become more
generic. In fact, it fc.c should be probably split so that it makes clear
what is generic code and what is SCSI specific code.
Cheers,
