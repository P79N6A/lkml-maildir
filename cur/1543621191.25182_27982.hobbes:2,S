> Reverse Mapping VM Patch #12e (Rik van Riel)
Except that Documentation/vm/Changelog.rmap still reports...
rmap 12a:
  - fix the compile warning in buffer.c                   (me)
  - fix divide-by-zero on highmem initialisation  DOH!    (me)
  - remove the pgd quicklist (suspicious ...)             (DaveM, me)
This is confusing to people.  is 12e applied??
