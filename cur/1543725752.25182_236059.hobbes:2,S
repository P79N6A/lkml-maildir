Well, back in v2.4 "hot-stop", most of the patches merged into distro's kernels 
were not "trustable" enough to be merged into v2.4 mainline, and I had no capability 
of reviewing them myself and make a good enough judgment of whether they should be included
or not.
Another point I had against merging some of those patches was that most of them were 
targeted at "enterprise" users and benefit almost only them (eg finer-grained locking, etc). 
To resume, I prefered to be more "conservative". 
Of course, fortunately Andrew is much more capable of doing judgements on
"trustability" of patches and so forth.
Obviously its a good thing to try to keep the differences between distro's kernels
and mainline kernels small, and Andrew is targetting that.
