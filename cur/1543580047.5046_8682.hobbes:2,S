Sorry. Corruption happens since I have this motherboard just before
christmas - something about 2.4.0-test13-pre2. It was not so massive
as today - with 2.4.0-ac10 (before it just died, today it damaged
hdh in addition). I got corruption/lockup with other versions (test13-pre3,
test13-pre7, 2.4.0, 2.4.0-ac3, 2.4.0-ac8, 2.4.0-ac9) too,
but as this one (ac10) does NMI watchdog on UP, I finally found
what's wrong instead of silent death - it is why I finally wrote
this letter - so you can either __sti() or mdelay() in ide_delay_50ms.
So others will not suffer from silent death instead of IDE reset...
Then I can test whether promise recovers from this - I doubt, as it
looks like that some data for /dev/hde landed on /dev/hdh (impossible,
I know...).

For now I said that both disks should use PIO4 and it looks stable...
But there is visible difference in speed between PIO4 and UDMA5 ;-)
I have no idea whether TOSHIBA can do UDMA CRCs, but it works fine
at work, where I connected it to i440BX, and since November I
connect it to VIA694X/686A. Both in UDMA2 mode without troubles.
