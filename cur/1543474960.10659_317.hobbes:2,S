I do not think these problems are reasonable with a major ISP like Demon
Internet, for packets originating at the ISP.
As it happens, the packets also appear to be misrouted (I shouldn't
receive them), and the checksum errors are more than single bit errors
(pick a random number).

Understood.  However, please include a /proc option to turn the messages
on.  There is a genuine problem around, and it's due to something more
significant than bit errors.
