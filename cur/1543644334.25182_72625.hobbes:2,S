I could not duplicate this error in 2.5.38-bk.
However, I did notice some other anomalies during testing.  My testing 
consisted of dd if=/dev/cdrom of=cd.iso under 2.4.18-10 and 2.5.38-bk.  I 
tried both a small mail spool (2 MB) cd and a large document cd (637 MB).  
The small file copied fine under both, but 2.5.38-bk read two fewer 
sectors than 2.4.18-10 (32404 vs. 32406).  On disk, the files created 
were:
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root     668475392 Sep 22 12:01 cd2.iso
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root     668479488 Sep 22 11:51 cd.iso
from the same source cd.
