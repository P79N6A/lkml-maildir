Hi all,
I have a hard time maintaining the i2c subsystem alone. New drivers
and, more importantly, subsystem evolutions are submitted much faster
than I can review and merge them. I am hearing complaints about this.
It has been lasting for a while now and it doesn't seem like the
situation is going to improve. Thus, I think it would be better if
someone was co-maintaining the i2c subsystem with me.
So, if anyone is interested in co-maintaining the i2c subsystem with
me, please let me know. The ideal candidate would come from the
embedded world, as I have absolutely no experience with this myself and
most of the new drivers are for embedded devices, and should have
contributed to the kernel in a significant way already.
Thanks,
