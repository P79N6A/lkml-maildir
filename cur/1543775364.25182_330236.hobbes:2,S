Doesn't x86_64 map the kernel code into a different virtual address
range than the direct mapping of physical memory--and __get_free_pages()
returns a pointer to the direct mapping area rather than to the kernel
text area?  This would prevent the problem, because I assume the entire
direct mapping of physical memory area is set to non-executable.
The problem with i386 occurs because the kernel code and kernel memory
is all mapped to the same virtual address range (at 0xC0000000), so
kernel code, and free pages returned by __get_free_pages(), both reside
in the same large page.
So, if I understand correctly what's going on in x86_64, your fix
wouldn't be applicable to i386.  In x86_64, every large page has a
correct "ref_prot" that is the normal setting for that page... but in
i386, the kernel text area does not--it should ideally be split into
small pages all the time if there are both kernel code & free pages
residing in the same 2M area.
