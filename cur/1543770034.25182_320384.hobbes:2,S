Yes.  I hadn't realized that the only safe-guard in place was 
proc_check_root.  I had made the assumption that follow_link was using 
vfs_follow_link with the readlink info.

So you'd say 'mount /dev/foo /proc/self/fd/4' if 4 was an fd pointing to 
a directory in another namespace?
That does require proc_check_root be removed.  :\

As far as I could tell without doing high-smp benchmarks, it doesn't 
slow anything down.  In this case, we aren't on the fastest path anyway, 
as we are usually
a) walking a path across a mountpoint, requiring the global 
vfsmount_lock anyway.
b) closing a file, which isn't fast either.
You could micro-optimize the pivoting of from one vfsmount to another 
during a walk to only grab the lock once, but there may be no profound 
effect and any gains would be lost in the noise.
