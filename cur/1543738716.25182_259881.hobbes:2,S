You could start by reading Documentation/BUG-HUNTING and 
Documentation/oops-tracing.txt
Also, you could post the Oops to the list so other people can take a look 
at it. Including info on your hardware, kernel version etc is often 
useful. Take a look at 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/lkml/reporting-bugs.html
 for details 
on what it is usually a good idea to provide (also take a look at the 
other documents linked from that page).

PS. That obfuscation of your email address is pretty annoying. Besides, 
once there has been a single reply to you and the list with the edited 
address it's no longer useful to prevent spam, so it's a pretty pointless 
thing to do in the first place.
