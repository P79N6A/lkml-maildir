Subject: Updating include/asm symlink when $ARCH changes

I cross compile arm and mips kernels from the same kernel tree.  When
I build a kernel the first time with a fresh kernel tree, the
include/asm symlink is set properly.  However, when I compile for a
different $ARCH, the include/asm is not changed and the build fails.
Would it be possible for the build system to update the include/asm
symlink when it doesn't correspond to the architecture you're
currently trying to build for?
