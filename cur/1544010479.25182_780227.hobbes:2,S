Since struct fsnotify_event is not exported to userspace information may
be collected in there at event creation time.  I actually have a number
of later patches that do this for information that I want to send for
fanotify.
Information can also be stored in the event->private area if only one
group really cares....   (kinda how I store wd for inotify)
Information which is useful to more than 1 group should be added to
struct fsnotify_event and its up to the individual listeners to export
that to userspace anyway they want to.
So absolutely this is completely extensible.
