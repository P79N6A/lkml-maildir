Well, since there seems to be interest in this (and it's indeed very cheap
programmer time wise :) I will try to add such SMP optimization for the
next 2.2.xaa release.
BTW, unlock_kernel() isn't enough. I think the right implementation is:
	int old_lock_depth = current->lock_depth;
	if (old_lock_depth >= 0) {
		current->lock_depth = -1;
		spin_unlock(&kernel_flag);
	}
	/* copy user */
	if (old_lock_depth >= 0) {
		if (current->lock_depth != -1)
			BUG();
		current->lock_depth = old_lock_depth;
		spin_lock(&kernel_flag);
	}
