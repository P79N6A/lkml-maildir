Well afaics, nfs works around this issue by having fs/nfsctl.o always
as a builtin and abstract the calls through a file system using
read/write. That would be Ben's idea again, i.e. not actually
using a system call.
The only widely used module that I'm aware of ever implementing a system
call was the TUX web accelerator that that used a hack in entry.S
and its own dynamic registration.
