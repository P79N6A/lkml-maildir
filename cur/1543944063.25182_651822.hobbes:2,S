So the real application is trying to yield?  If so, you could try
prodding /proc/sys/kernel/sched_compat_yield.
It shouldn't matter if you yield or not really, that should reduce the
number of non-work spin cycles wasted awaiting preemption as threads
execute in series (the problem), and should improve your performance
numbers, but not beyond single threaded.
If I plugged a yield into the busy wait, I would expect to see a large
behavioral difference due to yield implementation changes, but that
would only be a symptom in this case, no?  Yield should be a noop.
