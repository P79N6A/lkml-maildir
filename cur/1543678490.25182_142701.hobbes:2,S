Hello!
I'm using btc9001ah keyboard and meet the problem
when so-called internet keys can't be emulated by
linux-2.4.21.
I've got this message:
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 256
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 257
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 258
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 259
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 260
This lines were produces when I pressed so-called
FreeKey1-FreeKey5 on my keyboard!
It was caused by the fact that drivers/input/keybdev.c
limits x86_keycodes size by 256 elements!
Would it possible to extend this table in 2 times at least?
Thanks!
Best regards! Nick
