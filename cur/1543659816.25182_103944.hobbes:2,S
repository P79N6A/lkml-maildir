	The IrDA patch that went into 2.4.20 have been on my web page
for over a year, so well tested...

	This clearly point out to problems with the lower layer,
either the serial port or the TTY layer, not the IrDA stack. Verify
that the IrDA link is aligned and that there is no source of noise.
	By any chance, are you running a preemptible or SMP kernel ?

	You need to know if you are using irtty or irport.

	Do :
	> cat /proc/tty/driver/serial
	And send the result to the serial port author/mailing list. If
you see lot's of FE, that's your problem.
	Do an irdadump (with version 15 of irda-tools) while
connecting and send it the the IrDA mailing list.
	Try 2.4.21-pre3.
	With 2.4.20, revert the patch on my page called "Very
important fixes" and try again. If this fix the problem, you need to
try 2.4.21-pre3 with the patch called "Handle invalid QoS parameter"
and set max_tx_window to 1.
	Regards,
	Jean
