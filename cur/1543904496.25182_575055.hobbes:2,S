Yeah, the nonrecursive behaviour is a bugger.  Also I found it helped
to queue operations in userspace and execute periodically rather than
trying to execute on every single notification.  Worked well for
indexing, for virus scanning though you'd want to do some risk
analysis.
It'd be nice to have a filesystem that handled that sort of thing
internally *cough*winfs*cough*.  That was my hope for reiserfs a very
long time ago with its pluggable fs modules feature.
