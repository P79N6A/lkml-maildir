So, basically, if you compile a kernel for a 386, but think that maybe
one day you might need to run it on an Athlon for debugging purposes,
you use 128 byte padding, because it's not too bad on the 386?  Seems
pretty wasteful to me when the obvious, simple, elegant solution is to
allow independent selection of workaround inclusion and optimisation.
Especially since half of the work has already been done.
John.
