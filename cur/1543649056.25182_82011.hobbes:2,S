In the US it is illegal to yell fire in a theater if there is no
fire.  That is there are forms of speech that are clearly bad.

And freely modifiable.  Which sounds like freedom to me to do pretty
much what I want with the a program.
Code available under the BSD license is freely modifiable, but not
necessarily freely available.
Not being able to get the code sounds a lot less free to me.

Given I haven't forced anyone to use GPL'd software I am not forcing anyone
to do anything, unless they want to use my software.  Nor are you
forcing anyone to anything with BitKeeper.  And the kernel is setup so
no one has to use BitKeeper to develop the kernel. 
Using the Linux kernel as a tool to advocate only GPL'd software seems
inappropriate as those are not the aims of the kernel maintainers.  If
RMS wants that he is free to fork the kernel, or write a kernel that
with a license that prohibits people from using software you don't
like.
