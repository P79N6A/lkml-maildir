Hello,
I have a question. I use framebuffer on my 3dfx voodoo3 3000 graphic card
I use framebuffer. When I only boot kernel (not using append) console switch 
from 80x25 to 80x30 and booting penguin si pretty nice, colored and its 
background is black.
When I instruct kernel with append using this in my lilo.conf
image=/boot/vmlinuz
        label=linux
        read-only
        root=/dev/hda3
        append="video=tdfx:1024x768-24@75"
console switch to 128x48 writing
fb: Voodoo3 memory = 16384K
fb: MTRR's turned on
tdfxfb: reserving 1024 bytes for the hwcursor at d1818000
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 128x48
fb0: 3Dfx Voodoo3 frame buffer device
but penguin is black-white and background is white. After booting I can use 
console without problem and it is color. But I like my penguin. Where is 
problem? Is it on my side or problem of driver? This happens when I try to 
use 60 Hz too.
Thanks a lot
Michal
