Of course, but that's also the purpose of -rc. And given its small
footprint, it will be as easy to revert it as to apply it, should any
big problem appear.

The only difference is the time to get it in the right shape. If it
requires 3 versions (6 months), it may be worth "upgrading" the current
scheduler to make users happy. I'm not kidding, I've switched the default
boot to 2.6 on my notebook after trying SD and CFS. It was the first time
I got my system in 2.6 at least as usable as in 2.4. And I know I'm not
the only one.
