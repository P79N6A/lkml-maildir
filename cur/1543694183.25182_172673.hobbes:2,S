Is there a user-space interface planned for this? 
One possibility may be just to hang it off fsync(2) so fsync doesn't return
until until all the buffers it flushed are actually synced to disk. That's its
documented semantics anyways.
There's also the case of files opened with O_SYNC. Would inserting a write
barrier after every write to such a file destroy performance?
