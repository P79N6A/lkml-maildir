Ok, so I am a bit confused here.  We basically have 3 ways to use
cdrecord on linux-2.6 without ide-scsi:
1) cdrecord dev=/dev/hdx
2) cdrecord dev=ATA
3) cdrecord dev=ATAPI
Now, if I run all three and grep for '^Warning', I get:
-----
 $ cdrecord dev=/dev/cdrw -scanbus 2>&1 | grep '^Warning'
Warning: Open by 'devname' is unintentional and not supported.
 $ cdrecord dev=ATA -scanbus 2>&1 | grep '^Warning'
Warning: Using badly designed ATAPI via /dev/hd* interface.
 $ cdrecord dev=ATAPI -scanbus 2>&1 | grep '^Warning'
Warning: Using ATA Packet interface.
Warning: The related Linux kernel interface code seems to be unmaintained.
Warning: There is absolutely NO DMA, operations thus are slow.

Which means:
1) dev=/dev/hdx	- Open by 'devname' is unintentional and not supported.
2) dev=ATA	- Using badly designed ATAPI via /dev/hd* interface.
3) dev=ATAPI	- Using ATA Packet interface.
                  (And some nice things about it not being maintained and
                   slow)
If I check the source for that, I get:
-----
libscg $ grep "Open by 'devname' is unintentional and not supported." *
scsi-linux-sg.c:                        "Warning: Open by 'devname' is unintentional and not supported.\n");
libscg $ grep 'Using badly designed ATAPI via /dev/hd\* interface.' *
scsi-linux-sg.c:                                "Warning: Using badly designed ATAPI via /dev/hd* interface.\n");
libscg $ grep 'Using ATA Packet interface.' *
scsi-linux-ata.c:               error("Warning: Using ATA Packet interface.\n");
libscg #
-----
Which hopefully (without really checking the source) means each are
implemented in these source files:
1) dev=/dev/hdx	- scsi-linux-sg.c
2) dev=ATA	- scsi-linux-sg.c
3) dev=ATAPI	- scsi-linux-ata.c
So if I take note of you comment above about scsi-linux-ata.c (or actually
give a fart about Jorg's warning about unmaintained and slow), should ATA
rather than ATAPI not be the recommended way??
Also, how about having the kernel print a warning when the depreciated
interface (ATAPI??) is used ?
