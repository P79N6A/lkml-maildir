Problem is that some of those devices are not that special. For example,
the on-board 16550 is accessed using readb/writeb in the 8250.c driver.
I don't think we want to add that level of low-level detail to that
driver and instead should just hide it in the platform code. I look
at it from the point of view that the driver should not care about how
the access actually occurs on the bus. It just says, write data foo at
location bar regardless of whether bar is ISA, PCI, on-chip, RapidIO,
etc and that writing of the data is hidden in the implementation of
the accessor API.
