The scheduler is too complex for me. So the confusingly named
"reschedule_idle" is called on wake and if preemption_goodness
tells it to, it can set need_resched, which as Jun Sun, points out, can  belong
to a process that is in the middle of being replaced by a second process.
Ok.  That makes sense and his fix seems reasonable: need
          current->needs_resched =  (prev->needs_resched?1:current->needs_resched);
in __schedule_tail 
Thanks.
BTW: the comments on schedule, that it is simple and nice and that "the goto" is
     interesting are out of date.
