One of the major drawbacks (besides the scalability issues discussed
here) of
select is the missing integration of other kernel generated events. It
would be
really nice if the select replacement could synchronously wait for
signals and
maybe SYSV-IPC. If it could wait for signals the libc implementation
might be able
to wait for pthread conditions, too.
What I want to say is, that I want to be able to wait for just about any
event.
This way single threaded applications would be much easier to write.
This would mean a change to declare_interest so that it can accept
parameters
other than a file descriptor and to the event_descr_t so that it can
report
events other than those related to a file descriptor.
