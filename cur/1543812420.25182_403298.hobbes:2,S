Thanks for continuing to profile this stuff. We've definitely got lots of
profiling to do, so any help is welcome.

Heh, well if you remember from irc I told you that there was more to do -
specifically that I was looking at increasing the memory dedicated to the
hash.

I completely agree that we need to increase the memory dedicated to the
hash, but I fear that vmallocing a 1 megabyte table per domain (effectively
per mount) is going overboard. I will assume that this was a straw man patch
:)

Right. That's one possible approach - I was originally thinking of
allocating a large global lockres hash table allocated at module init time.
This way we don't have to make large allocs for each domain.
Before anything else though, I'd really like to get an idea of how large we
want things. This might very well dictate the severity of the solution.

Yes, this patch seems much easier to swallow ;) Thanks for doing that work.
I have some comments about it below.

Definitely if you get a chance to show how much just the lookup optimization
helps, I'd like to know. I'll also try to gather some numbers.

Indeed. The real time numbers are certainly confusing. I actually saw real
time decrease on most of my tests (usually I hack things to increase the
hash allocation to something like a few pages). I want to do some more
consecutive untars though.
Btw, for what it's worth, here's some single untar numbers I have lying
around. Sync numbers are basicaly the same.
Before the hlist patch:
    real    0m21.279s
    user    0m3.940s
    sys     0m18.884s
With the hlist patch:
    real    0m15.717s
    user    0m3.924s
    sys     0m13.324s

Good idea. As you probably already know, we've never been beyond checking to
see how ext3 handles a given problem :)

Did you notice this during the untar? If not, do you have any reproducible
test case?

This doesn't surprise me - our unlink performance leaves much to be desired
at the moment. How many nodes did you have mounted when you ran that test?
Off the top of my head,the two things which I would guess are hurting delete
the most right now are node messaging and lack of directory read ahead. The
first will be solved by more intelligent use of the DLM so that the network
will only be hit for those nodes that actually care about a given inode --
unlink rename and mount/unmount are the only things left that still use the
slower 'vote' mechanism. Directory readahead is much easier to solve, it's
just that nobody has gotten around to fixing that yet :/ I bet there's more
to figure out with respect to unlink performance.

Hey, we appreciate the help so far - thanks.

We're not trying to hide anything from anyone :) I'm always happy to talk
about design. We've been in bugfix (and more recently, performance fix) mode
for a while now, so there hasn't been much new design yet.

Is the likely() here necessary? It actually surprises me that the check even
helps so much - if you check the way OCFS2 lock names are built, the first
few bytes are very regular - the first char is going to almost always be one
of M, D, or W. Hmm, I guess if you're hitting it 1/3 fewer times...

Also here, lengths of OCFS2 locks are also actually fairly regular, so
perhaps the likely() isn't right?
