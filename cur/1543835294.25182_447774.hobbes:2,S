We don't know. Maybe they check the ThinkPad part number (of which
there are many hundreds but IBM/Lenovo has the full list and can
update the driver whenever a new model comes out); or maybe just
assume you won't install it on the wrong hardware.

Yes. But it's the best we've been able to come up with, after
considerable community effort.
Anyway, this patch is independent of the ThinkPad case; DMI
information is there for drivers to see it, after all, so the kernel
should make it possible. Can I get a Signed-off-by?
