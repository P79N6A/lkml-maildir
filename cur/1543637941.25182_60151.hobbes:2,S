Sorry about that Jens, I should have qualified it with the taskfile io
operations and the other subdrivers added and other tweaks.  I can not
comment on the legacy path as it relates to 2.5, and that was my mistake.
Corrected post:
The original TASKFILE IO transport layer for which 2.5 was to be based
upon is correct and fixed wrt to 2.5 BIO API.  Additional updates include
ide-floppy and ide-tape and a few updates to ide-scsi24.
If it were not for you bring the port forward I would not have considered
it viable.  For that I thank you for your efforts, and again I apologize
for wrongful comments do to my lack of clarity.
Also the group refers to NCITS membership, for which "The 'Hale Landis'",
is its alternate and we work togather as it relates to the paper spec.

  Other than that public point of record, I am
the public rep of LAD-SCG.
Cheers,
