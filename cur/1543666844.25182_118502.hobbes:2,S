the inflating doubling the ato is too slow after you destroyed the ato
info setting it to 4 this is why it takes so long for 2.4 to clock
things properly, at least you should inflate it with the average down.
the <= in the window raise check in recvmsg as well generate window
updates too early, I find better to wait two packets to be read before
sending the window update. Now that I understood better how the logic in
mainline works I'll try to make a better patch (not very soon though
since I'm busy with other stuff and next week I'll be offline most of
the time).
