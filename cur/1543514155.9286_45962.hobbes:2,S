Subject: [patch] NLS for vfat shortnames

Hi,
I have written patches for the NLS translation of short file names in vfat
file system and for Unicode based case conversion. They solve problems
with special characters, e.g. Ä, Ö, ß, í, û.
The patches are to be found under
http://www.bsz.shk.th.schule.de/download/linux/.
I would be pleased much about comments. Please send messages to the topic
directly to me additionally, because I do not read the list every time.
Thanks,
Wolfram
