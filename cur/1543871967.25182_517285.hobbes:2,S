Pretty much.  For most of the other cases I think we are safe referring
to them as resource controls or resource limits.    I know that roughly covers
what cpusets and beancounters and ckrm currently do.
The real trick is that I believe these groupings are designed to be something
you can setup on login and then not be able to switch out of.  Which means
we can't use sessions and process groups as the grouping entities as those 
have different semantics.
