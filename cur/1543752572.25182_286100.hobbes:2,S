Subject: 2.4.28(+?): Strange ARP problem

Hi,
We use Linux extensively here at Sonic.net.  Our web servers have two
NIC's -- a NIC with a public IP address, and a NIC on our SAN (with NetApps).
When we tried to upgrade to 2.4.28, we encountered a problem with NetApp
reachability, which turns out to have been a problem with ARP:  we
were seeing two ARP entries for the NetApp IP's.  One would be correct, and
one would be "incomplete".
Occasionally, a system would glom onto the incomplete entry, and NFS
connectivity would tank.  This doesn't happen with 2.4.27.
We'd like to upgrade to 2.4.29-rc2, but we have much trepidation about doing
so.  I certainly don't want to treat the list as "our own personal help
desk" (as warned about in the FAQ), but was hoping someone could shed some
light on the problem.  I think either myself or one of our guys can write a
patch to fix it, if someone would point us in the right direction.
Thank you,
 -Scott
