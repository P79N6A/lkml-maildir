There is a simple rule of thumb:
If the kernel code is not even ready for testing: don't inlcude it
in external releases.
If it makes sense to test the code and it uses new interfaces then you
need to make the interfaces available to potential users of the interface.
If the interface is going to change then the user should be informed about the
fact, but you yould need the kernel interface include files.
glibc exports own interaces and for this reason needs to supply own include 
files. I see no reason however that glibc should deal with include files that
do not even affect glibc code. This is true for most ioctl()s,
it is definitely true for the SCSI related ioctl()s.
