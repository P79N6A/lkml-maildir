My main point is that I think the early init stuff (i.e.,
serial8250_isa_init_ports()) should go away, so we don't have the
dichotomy of having the compiled-in stuff handled differently than
the run-time enumerated stuff.
It really doesn't matter for ia64, since we discover all the ports
via either PCI enumeration or ACPI.  We don't put anything in
old_serial_port[] at all.  For platforms that can't do that,
there'd still have to be compiled-in tables, but the entries
should be added using the standard register_serial() interface
just like everything else.

We've both posted working code that are at least baby steps toward
a better solution, so I hope we can make some progress.
