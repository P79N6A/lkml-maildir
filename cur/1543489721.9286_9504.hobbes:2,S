This error is very strange -- del_timer() is performed on all entry
points to ide_do_request(). Geert, can you log each add_timer() and
del_timer() performed by the IDE driver, and verify that indeed two
add_timer() were called in a raw? We can also try to force an oops
at that place and look at the stack trace for some hints.
