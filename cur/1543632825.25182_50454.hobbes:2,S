Years of hacking on ELF formats :(

Ignore drivers/usb/host/built-in.o, it is a conglomerate that contains
one object, the script cannot distinguish between that and a normal
object.

R_386_32 is an ELF relocation type for ix86 binaries.  It means that
uhci-hcd.c has code that refers to a function defined as __exit.  The
only such function is uhci_hcd_cleanup but I cannot see where it is
being referenced.  The USB people should be able to track this one
down.
