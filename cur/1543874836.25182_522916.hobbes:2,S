which is why i asked if you had any hints ... if no one else is doing
it, it means no standard exists, which means there's nothing for me to
copy :)
it isnt obvious to me how to leverage the normal platform_device and
resource structures to achieve moving the class out of the driver and
into a boards file ... i'm perfectly happy doing this knowing what the
correct direction to take things ... but i guess this gets us back to
if no one is doing this yet and no one has any proposals, it's on our
shoulders to get it resolved satisfactorily
i might also argue (for fun) that some of the bus drivers arent doing
it correctly ... they should implement support for the specific I2C
implementation and then a different file for the specific
[mother]board would contain the specific details

this is certainly true, but i'd rather have the default behavior be
"allow any I2C device on the bus" than "only allow I2C devices that
dont check the bus type" ...

i dont see why we would complain when it's obviously our fault ;)
it also wouldnt be a real issue as it's an embedded board, so it'd
only have the drivers enabled for devices that are actually hooked up
...
