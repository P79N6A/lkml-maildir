You wish.
Except it wasn't so.
Follow the list, and read the emails that were cc'd to you.
pre2 was fine, pre3 was not.
ac12 was fine, ac13 was not.
pre3 with the pre2 page_launder was fine.
There is no question about it. The patch that caused problems was the one
that was reversed. Please stop confusing the issue.
