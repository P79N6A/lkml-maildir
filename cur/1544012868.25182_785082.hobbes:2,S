Sure, will test, I am also sure that this will work.
Unfortunely mac8211 is broken in regard to led handling.
Since ath5k doesn't do timers, led blinks very often, thus usually I
don't even see it, and moreover sometimes it gets 'inverted' and I
tested and this looks like software issue, just writing numbers to /sys
led interface works but triggers from mac8211, they are inverted.
This issue is masked on my iwl3945 since they use mac led triggers only
as a "suggestion" and blink the leds according to their own traffic
measurement, and timers (and still the code that should blink led at
different rates doesn't work, still led ether blinks or not at constant
rate)
