This patch changes some of the core stuff touched by
64-bit-dev_t-kdev_t.patch (the driver stuff is left alone) to use
explicitly sized types (ie, __u64).  The only really controvertial part of
it is the inclusion of asm/types.h in asm/posix_types.h; since asm/types.h
only (on most archs) defines the standard {u,s}{8,16,32,64} types and
umode_t, I don't think namespace pollution will be much of an issue...
