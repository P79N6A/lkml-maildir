Hi Werner,
The real problem is that the original design ("make config") is no
longer suitable.  The original design dates back to 1991, when there
were only a few configuration options (and only one architecture!),
and when we could assume the users were technically sophisticated.

The dependency structure keeps poking out.
The front end can show all the options (like xconfig) and have an
additional feature to show the dependencies for the unavailable options:
when the user clicks on the option, the front end pops up a window
showing the if-conditions and dep-options for that option.
The front end can also have a toggle to suppress the unavailable
options options (like menuconfig always does).  I personally advocate
that this be the default.

Urgle, that's true.  I mean it has less constraints.
