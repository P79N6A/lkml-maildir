Subject: [PATCH 5/7] ACPI, PCI: PCIe AER _OSC support capabilities called when root bridge added
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

ACPI, PCI: PCIe AER _OSC support capabilities called when root bridge added
The _OSC capability OSC_EXT_PCI_CONFIG_SUPPORT is set when the root
bridge is added with pci_acpi_osc_support(), so we no longer need to do
it in the PCIe AER driver.
