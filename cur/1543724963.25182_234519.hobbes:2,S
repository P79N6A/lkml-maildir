Hi Andrew!
the check_mnt() in do_add_mount() breaks namespaces
in that way, that it forbids mounting single sb 
filesystems (like procfs) to be mounted in different
namespaces ...
I guess this is unintentional, but who knows ...
(this was introduced in 2.6.8-rc1, 2.6.7-bk20 works
as expected) 
something like this (untested) fixes? it ...
