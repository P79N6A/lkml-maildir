You need to go search the archives and read the *extensive* thread
on this from when it was introduced.  Lots of high profile kernel
developers were in on this one.
The idea is really simple:  eliminate the need for HIGHMEM
on common machines.  
And yes, VMSPLIT_2G really means VMSPLIT_2G_OPT,
in the same way as the (added last) VMSPLIT_3G_OPT flag.
Cheers
