Subject: CALL FOR MAINTAINER:  modutils package
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Nobody seems to be maintaining the modutils package.  It has been
pointed out several times now, and nobody has come forward to my
knowledge.  Several people have stated that they have various
patches to the package that fix several problems people have been
having, primarily with dual booting 2.0/2.2, however no official
release has occured.
So, I have taken it upon myself to ask that someone please step
forward and claim maintainership of this package as it is a
critical package, and its neglect is causing no end of trouble
for many people.
I am certainly not capable of maintaining the package, so I'm not
volunteering, however someone should do it.
I *CHALLENGE* someone to do it in fact.  Whoever does it will
obtain the highest level of worship from many adoring fans.
Come on someone!  Take it on, if not for humankind, do it for
the pure chewing satisfaction!
