Problem is:
There are  cool superblock magics  for reiserfs. And for  ext[23]. And
even for good old Minix. Cool.
However,  there  are   also  ugly  file  systems,  such   as  fat  for
example. Fat has been defined as  "something that can be read by a fat
driver", which  can be pretty  much anything. You can't  really detect
whether it is fat. Even Microsoft only guess whether some FS is fat or
not.
And don't  say detect it  via a partition  table.  There are a  lot of
cases where you get absolutely no  or wrong information out of it, and
there are also lots of cases where you plainly have none.
