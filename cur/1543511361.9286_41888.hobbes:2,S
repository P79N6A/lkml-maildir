Subject: IDE + SMP lockups solved (for me: dual P3, promise66, 37GB IBM drives, RAID5)

Like some other people, I also experienced lockups with EIDE drives and SMP.
If I understand the current situation right, there are two IDE+SMP problems right now (Kernel 2.2.12):
(1) lockups with two IDE controllers on the same interrupt
(2) general lockups, even with all controllers (or drives) on different interrupts
Supposedly (2) only happens with two or more disk drives, eventually only if on two different controllers. For (1), obviously, one needs two drives on two controllers, both on the same interrupt (as with promise controllers).
I experienced both problems with 4 EIDE drives, all on promise controllers.
I use Ingo Molnar´s raid patches. But I experienced the problems without the raid patches, too.
An easy method to reproduce (1) seems to be "hdparm -t <first drive> & hdparm -t <second drive>" (at least this reproduces it reliably for me).
I could reproduce (2) by starting the raid5 reconstruction process (mkraid). After a few minutes, the machine reliably was dead (obviously since raid5 reconstruction bangs hard on all drives simultaneously; anyway: reliable bugs are good bugs).
Amazingly, the solution for both problems seems to be Tom Livingston´s patch. I.e. it not only resolves (1) (which can also be resolved by not using two controllers on the same interrupt), but it also solves (2). For me, at least.
Unfortunately, my current kernel is not really representative or clean (I need a number of patches).
It is:
- based on 2.2.13pre14
- patched with Andre Hedricks IDE patch (19990925, for promise UDMA66)
- patched with Ingo Molnar´s raid5 patch
- patched with Andries Brouwer´s large disk patch (for 2.3.14, considered as "probably unusable" by him, but amazingly patches well for 2.2.13pre14, and even works, however needs >>append = "hde=4650,255,63...<< to be added to lilo.conf for the IBM drives)
- patched with Tom Livingstons IDE-SMP ide.c patch
However, as far as I can see, the IDE+SMP lockup problems don´t seem to be specific to this configuration.
Until now, the machine works well. It continuously get´s stressed by a test program, banging on the raid partition formed of the four IBM 37GB drives, with 30 processes read/write concurrently. For many hours now. Still no problem. As it seems, Tom´s patch solves the lockup problems.
More remarks:
Alan:
Tom´s patch might eventually be something for 2.2.13 final. It´s risky, but if ifdef´d for SMP only, it at least doesn´t affect non-SMP people, and it may make SMP users with several drives (or controllers?) very happy.
Or, alternatively: a big fat kernel boot warning if SMP and several drives are detected.
For large drives: Andries´ patch is large, risky, and obviously not for general consumption. Probably another fat ugly boot warning might be useful for people trying to get very large/37GB drives working.
Andre:
I vote to include Tom´s patch into your Unified IDE. It at least makes me (SMP-wise) very happy.
Tom:
the server is still banging on it´s drives, without crashing. Thanks a lot for your miraculous patch!
If anyone else needs the patches required for a bleeding edge configuration similar to mine: mail me and I´ll send them.
