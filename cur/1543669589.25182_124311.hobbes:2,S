Maybe we could replace some cli/sti pairs with spinlocks? If it
takes more time to cli/sti than to run the whole code section
that will be protected by the spinlock, then it might be better
to use that instead and block in the IRQ dispatch code.
But I have no measures, how fast the spinlocks are in the
non-/contention case
Problems: 
   - The total amount of CLI/STI doesn't matter, for spinlocks it
     does (they are not recursive)
   - spinlocks are usally not compiled in
   - Older CPUs may still benefit from cli/sti.
What do you think?
