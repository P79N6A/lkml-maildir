I've taken one pass through your message.  Sounds like you have thought
about this.  My question for you is have you run a business?  Do you
have employees?  How many?
I have no idea where on the spectrum you sit but the thought has occurred 
to me that arguing business models with people who are operating from 
a 100% theoretical position is likely to not reach any agreement in my
lifetime.
