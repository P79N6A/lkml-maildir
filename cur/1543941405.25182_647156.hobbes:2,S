heh... it's pretty obvious indeed. What's msleep_interruptible() is
all about? :-)
"sleep waiting for signals"
so the 'watchdog' thread gets woken up
[ as a result of cpu_callback(action = CPU_DEAD) --> kthread_stop() ]
just to be immediately scheduled out again for as long as the
remaining timeout > 0.
So it should work if we substitute msleep_interruptible() with
schedule_timeout_interruptible().
