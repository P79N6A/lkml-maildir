eek.  We're in the process of hunting down and eliminating exactly this
construct.  There have been cases where the compiler cached the
atomic_read() result in a register, turning the above into an infinite
loop.
Plus we should never add power-burners like that into the kernel anyway. 
That loop should have a cpu_relax() in it.  Which will also fix the
compiler problem described above.
Thirdly, please always add a newline when coding statements like that:
	while (expr())
		;
