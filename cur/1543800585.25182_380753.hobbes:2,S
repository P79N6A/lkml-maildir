I guess I was hoping to try to keep it simple, and just have two
variants, the __ version would require the caller to do the locking.
In cases like eg. allocstall, they should happen infrequently enough
that the extra complexity is probably not worth worrying about.
I don't think I commented about the preempt race though (and requirement
to have preempt off from process context), which obviously can be a
problem as you say (though I think things are currently safe?).

I guess nr_dirty looks OK in the places it can be put under tree_lock.
nr_page_table_pages is OK because ptl should be held to prevent preempt.
pgrotated and pgactivate should be good because of lru_lock.
Thanks for going through these!
