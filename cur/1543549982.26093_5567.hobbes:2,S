Thanks for the feedback, it is appreciated.

I thought about that,  but isn't the shared IP just an IP  alias and not the
primary IP? As far as I know, the machines which share the IP have a primary
IP and put that one in their ARP packets, so my patch should not complain.
That said, adding a flag that lets you disable the duplicate IP detection on
an interface basis wouldn't be a bad idea, I'll look into this.

Are you saying that  some machines would ARP with a  source IP of localhost?
That'd be  pretty broken, wouldn't  it? Or you talking  about a kind  of DOS
that would trigger warnings on all the machines?
(the dupe check could ignore that)

I'll look into this too.
Thanks for your feedback.
