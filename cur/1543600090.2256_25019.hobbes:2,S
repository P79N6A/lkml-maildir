Although this patch is obviously inspired by your patch, there is
a number of small differnces:
 * I do not have the major argument to add_gendisk/del_gendisk that
   you remove again in one of your later patches
 * I don't mess at all with the array of gendisks - that is a 2.5 issue.
 * I move all gendisk handling to drivers/block/genhd.c
 * I do not inline theseslow-path routines :)

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
