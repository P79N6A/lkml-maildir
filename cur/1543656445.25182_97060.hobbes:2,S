It's special enough that while programming under DOS, I had my own special  
routine which just took the BIOS ticker from low memory for a lot of  
things - even to decide if calling the actual time-of-day syscall was  
useful or if I should expect to get the same value back as last time.
That was a *serious* performance improvement. (Of course, DOS syscalls are  
S-L-O-W ...)
These days, the equivalent does call gettimeofday(). It's still probably  
the most-used syscall by far. (Hmm - maybe I can get some numbers for  
that? Must see if I get time today.) And *that* is why optimizing this one  
call makes sense.

Say what? Why wouldn't I be able to use it? Right now, I know of no SMP  
installation that's even in the planning ...

Why desktop? We use the same kind of thing in the server, and it's much  
more important there. Client performance is uninteresting - clients mostly  
wait anyway.

Nope, no interest in those. SMP *might* become interesting, but I don't  
think we'd ever want to care about weird stuff like NUMA ... at least not  
for the next five years or so.
We don't shovel nearly as much data around as the database guys.
