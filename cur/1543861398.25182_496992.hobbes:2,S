I am planning in this fashion:-
gcc-3.4.x (latest in that tree) to build 2.4.34 kernel
gcc-4.1.x (latest in that tree) to build 2.6.20 kernel (once released)
And, all the required utils for these kernels.
There is no other option for me (this is fairly I can call as an
Experimental work, but this effort would add a lots for my work in the
Labs).

This am not so sure (totally new for me), but I shall really try
Lunar...thanks :-)
This time am looking to work with the OpenSuSE10.2 to create my kind
of environment. But, am not sure if there are any big issues. Else, I
may stick to FC6.
Only bottleneck would be the wrapping the utils as you have mentioned earlier.

Very true, but I shall have a look at that, thanks again.

I have good exposure with Debain, especially with my Embedded domain
(ARM Linux). But, somehow I felt like am more comfortable with Fedora
or SuSE to do many other things (hmm, here I lack much of the Embedded
support compared to Debian).
This is my actual initiative; have to crack this problem.
Lastly, one question I didn't understand:-
Someone said in the reply to this thread that we shouldn't have 2
kernels on the same distro? I didn't understand here clearly *Why
Not*?
