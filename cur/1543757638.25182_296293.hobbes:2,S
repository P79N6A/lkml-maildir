But then that makes darcs do stuff the cvs way, and would make darcs exactly 
the opposite of how us darcs users want it, imho. If you're worried about 
darcs needing to open a billion files, nothing stops people from,  say, 
hacking darcs to use a SQL database to store patches in (they just have to 
code it, and I think I saw a SQL module for haskell around somewhere...)
May be I just don't understand the argument of why the CVS file format is 
anything short of insane, backwards, and outdated. We want each chunk of 
information to be both independent and have a clear history (ie, what patches 
does this patch rely on). CVS does not provide this, it is not fine grained 
enough for what darcs needs.
(David Roundy and Co can fill in the technical details of this, I'm not a 
versioning system expert)
In short, we need to move as far away from the CVS way of doing things, 
because ultimately its the wrong way. This is why I am somewhat dismayed when 
I hear of projects who move to SVN from CVS... SVN is just CVS with a few 
flaws fixed, and a few things like atomic commits added. It isn't the next 
step: it is just a small stepping stone between CVS and the next step.
