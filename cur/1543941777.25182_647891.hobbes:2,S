Note: as said in the comments, this is currently only for the
VisioBraille device, but having this in the vanilla kernel will help a
lot to get people testing drivers for other devices, as they will not
have to recompile a patched kernel but just insert test modules
(remember that for blind people it is already not so easy to just _use_
computers...)
