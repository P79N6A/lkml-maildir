Yeah, the typical way is to use spin_lock_nested(lock, nesting_level),
this allows one to annotate these nestings. However, nesting_level must
not be larger than 8, so if your batch is larger than that, we have a
problem.

Not quite, things like copy_pte_range() take 2.

I'm quite sure copy_pte_range() could be used so that it violates that
order.
