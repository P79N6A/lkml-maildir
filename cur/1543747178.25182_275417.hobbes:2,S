longrun-0.9 is hideously out of date, and was never debugged to begin
with.  Given that these days longrun is handled via cpufreq, there
doesn't seem to be much reason for the standalone longrun program.

Bit 3 is correct.

You shouldn't muck with it anyway.  And yes, they are different.  The
thermal extensions are handled via ACPI code, so as long as the ACPI
is handled correctly, it shouldn't matter.

The algorithms are very different, but it's all under-the-hood stuff
implemented in firmware.

C4 support (DSX) is pretty keen.
