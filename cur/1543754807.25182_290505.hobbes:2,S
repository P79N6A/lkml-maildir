We can't do that, look at line 944 of fs/binfmt_elf.c:
         if (current->personality & MMAP_PAGE_ZERO) {
                 /* Why this, you ask???  Well SVr4 maps page 0 as read-only,
                    and some applications "depend" upon this behavior.
                    Since we do not have the power to recompile these, we
                    emulate the SVr4 behavior.  Sigh.  */
                 down_write(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
                 error = do_mmap(NULL, 0, PAGE_SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC,
                                 MAP_FIXED | MAP_PRIVATE, 0);
                 up_write(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
         }
