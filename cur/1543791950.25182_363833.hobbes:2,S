Yes, there is a bit to disable reading performance counters in ring 3.
But I promise you to complain about a patch to add setting it in the context 
switch too :)

I don't believe they need it - the side channel attack is too theoretical for 
their use case.

LSM was actually quite measurable on some systems, the indirect 
calls really hurt on IA64 on some of the network benchmarks.

If they're not hot for some reason (e.g. cache pig in userspace) you're 
talking about 1000+ cycles.

The person talking about theory is you in my opinion with this basically
theoretical attack.

Better to stamp out any such attempts in the roots.
