MontaVista certainly won't recreate the work of Ingo!  That is nice work.
However, preemption points have their limitations, and are difficult to
maintain over time.  Also, preemption points don't address excessive
interrupt off paths (which are significant and already reported as problems
from more than one of our customers).  We are doing general characterization
work now (with an immediate focus on our customer reported responsiveness
problems), and will also do these characterizations on systems with Ingo's
patches; we'll report the results here and on our web pages.   Preliminary
data indicates there is plenty of opportunity for dramatic response
characteristic improvements in Linux, and we believe those opportunities
extend well beyond what is achieveable with carefully placed preemption
points.   Our initial data on this will be forthcoming, and will flow out
over time as we work through a sequence of improvement efforts.

ps: yes all MontaVista product work in kernel space will of course be
released under GPL, just as our compact PCI
backplane networking and powerPC cross development packages have been
released under GPL.
pps: We have no illusions about getting native Linux down the the RTLinux
range of responsiveness, 15-20 microsecond "guaranteed" kinds of levels.
RTLinux is a fine solution for that level of real-time requirement.
