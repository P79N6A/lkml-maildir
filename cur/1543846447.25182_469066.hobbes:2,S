That's a flaw in the whole idea of having pre-defined (by human) separate 
rules catching misc obvious (to us) spam indicators. If you had a filter that 
you just feed with raw data from many sources and that does pattern 
recognition and learns on its own, there (probably) would be no way to go 
around it. At least it wouldn't be easy. In fact i.e. when ANN is used as 
classifier, the rules created after training are hidden and have no obvious 
represantation to us so one would have no idea what to change to get the 
desired filter output.
