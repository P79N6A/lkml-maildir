Linux 2.6 has some problems recognizing my keyboard. I have to disconnect
and reconnect it several times every boot. The keyboards is a Logitech
internet navigator and it worked perfectly with Linux 2.4. The keyboard is
attached to a hub, but it behaves exactly the same if I connect it directly
to the case's plug. This is the output of dmesg about two failures and a
success:
hub 2-1:1.0: new USB device on port 1, assigned address 14
bus usb: add device 2-1.1
bound device '2-1.1' to driver 'usb'
