DVD players based on Sigma Designs EM8500 mpeg4 decoder seems to be
running uClinux. See here for some info:

The Sigma Designs EM8500 is apparently a combined mpeg4 decoder and RISC
processor. I'd assume that they would be required to release source code
on request for their kernel, even if the code is executed on the EM8500
directly, as opposed being controller by a kernel driver running on a
separate processor?
The firmware for the Bravo D1 DVD player can be downloaded as an ISO
image from this page;
