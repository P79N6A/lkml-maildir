I just had the  unfortunate experience in grading my Linux cluster with Red
Hat 6.0
All the machines in my cluster have no keyboards. I had no problems booting
up with Red Hat 5.2
Since I upgraded to Red Hat 6.0 I have not been able to boot any of the
machines that do not have a keyboard
The following displays on screen
LILO boot:
Loading Linux .................................
The screen will display this message forever.
The only way to get the system to reboot is to plug in a keyboard and
reboot.
I imagine that this is an extremely undesirable, since most people with
clustered PCs do not have a keyboard attached to every PC in their cluster
As far as I can tell something is checking for the keyboard in the Red Hat
6.0 during the
Loading Linux.............................
Anyone out there know how to stop it from doing that
Thanks
