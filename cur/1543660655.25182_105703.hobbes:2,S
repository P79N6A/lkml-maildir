The es1371 driver only provides one digital playback channel. So, if one
application uses /dev/dsp, other applications trying to do the same will
block.
Most likely, the web page you're trying to open has some flash animation
on it (even some ad banners use flash) and the flashplayer plugin tries
to open /dev/dsp and blocks, and since mozilla waits for the plugin
to initialize, it blocks, too.
