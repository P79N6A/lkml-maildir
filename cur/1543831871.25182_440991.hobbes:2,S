The problem is with X, it should not be doing a MAP_SHARED
mmap() of the framebuffer device.  It should be using
MAP_PRIVATE instead.
The kernel is trying to provide copy-on-write semantics for
the mapping, which doesn't make any sense for device registers.
That's why the kernel isn't setting the writable or modified
bits in the protection bitmask.
Please fix the X server :)
