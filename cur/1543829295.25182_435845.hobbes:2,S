In my upcoming patches for USB core suspend improvements, one of the 
changes affects this very piece of code.  Instead of looping over all 
child devices in the driver-model sense, it loops over all interfaces in 
the active configuration, which is all we care about right here.

I didn't write that routine, Dave Brownell did.  It has been there for
ages.  The "bogus requests" are attempts by the user to suspend a USB
device (by writing to /sys/devices/.../power/state) without first
suspending all its children and interfaces.
(This can't happen when doing a global suspend because the PM core 
iterates through the entire device tree.  It matters only for "runtime" or 
"selective" suspend.)
The two easiest ways to fix the problem are:
	Change the code to look through the interfaces in the active
	configuration instead of using device_for_each_child;
or
	Revert your "endpoints are devices" patch until my upcoming
	changes are in place.
