You know what pisses me off most about this thread?
RMS's elitest "I wrote all the free software so put my name on it"
attitude.  Sure, he did something great, started a free software movement.
BUT, that does not entitle him to world domination.  Linux is not the only
OS using GNU components.  Most EVERY free OS uses gcc, and quite a few
commercial ones do (ie: BSD/OS).  It is just plain SILLY to see him think
that because we use ls and stuff that are licensed under the GPL, that we
should put GNU in the name of the operating system.
