Makes sense. The patch on top of the latest -mm is below if you want to push
it. It has not been boot tested as building with the latest -mm is broken
at the moment for older powerpcs because of the git-powerpc.patch patch .
That patch assumes that mm_context_t is a struct with a vdso_base which is
not always the case (it's an unsigned long in include/asm-ppc/mmu.h).
