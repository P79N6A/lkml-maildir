I didn't want to do two allocations (one for struct _urb and one for struct urb).

How about 
static inline urb_init(urb)
{
        urb->xx = YY;
        ...
}
urb_alloc() 
{
        urb = kmalloc()
        urb_init(urb);
}
?

Thank you.
I was actually going to ask you guys if you'd be interested in generalizing this _urb_queue() 
stuff that I have for other drivers. Current URB api does not provide any interface for 
queueing/linking/etc of URBs in the _driver_ itself. Things like next, prev, etc are used in 
the HCD. So if driver submits bunch of different URBs (and potentially multiple URBs of the 
same type like hci_usb does) it has to implement its own lists, arrays and stuff. I used to 
use SKBs for URB queues but struct sk_buff is to big for that simple task.
