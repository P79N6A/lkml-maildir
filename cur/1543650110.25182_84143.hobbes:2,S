1) The hard drive is only about 50 years old, so there aren't any files older 
than that at the moment:

2) This thing is unlikely to be a problem in our lifetimes, our 
grandchildren's lifetimes, or our great grandchildren's lifetimes (barring 
unforseen advances in active telomere reconstruction and a regenerative 
interpretation of DNA that somehow looks at it as a blueprint rather than a 
recipe).
3) If any current hardware or software is still in use in the year 2554, it 
will be seriously overdue for an upgrade.
