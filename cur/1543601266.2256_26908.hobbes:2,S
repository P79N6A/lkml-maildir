Yes, in a really fancy VM manager we'd analyze the access patterns to get a 
reliable determination of what is serial access and what is not, and we'd do 
things like retroactively lowering the priority of pages we didn't initially 
know much about but were later able to determine were part of a serial access.
But we can pick the low-hanging fruit by just looking at where the most 
recent access lands.  This relies on the fact that most serial transfers 
procede forward.  If we get it wrong, a few pages end up referenced when they 
should not be, but so what?  Also, if a page ends up unreferenced when it 
should be then it still has a good chance to be rescued.

Right, the condition should be "transfer ends exactly at the lower of the end 
of page or end of file".

I'd say this one isn't a hack, its just a matter of finishing the job.
Sorry I should have done tested this a week ago but I got a little
distracted if you know what I mean.
Seeking around in a file will be handled OK.  We'll tend to drop those 
pages that are fully accessed but not reaccessed soon and retain pages that
are partially accessed.  So long as the aging mechanism doesn't drop the
ball, such pages will just live a little longer in cache, not forever.
What we're missing is a way for the swap cache to 'push back' at the page
cache.  Right now, the little bit of extra pressure I accidently created
by ignoring the subpage transfers is pushing all anonymous pages out of
memory.  That's way too fragile.
