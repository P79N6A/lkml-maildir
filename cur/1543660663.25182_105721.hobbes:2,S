Several people are reporting this.  We seem to have lost a disk request or
such.
First up, please see if changing this:
	static int antic_expire = HZ / 25;
to
	static int antic_expire = 0;
in drivers/block/deadline-iosched.c fixes it up.
If not then please confirm that
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.59/2.5.59-luuk/2.5.59-luuk.gz
still causes the problem.
If so then I'd really appreciate it if you could work through the individual
patches in
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.59/2.5.59-luuk/broken-out/
and find out which one is causing the problem.  The patch application order is
vmlinux-fix.patch
deadline-np-42.patch
deadline-np-43.patch
reiserfs-readpages.patch
ext3-scheduling-storm.patch
auto-unplug.patch
less-unplugging.patch
kirq.patch
kirq-up-fix.patch
ext3-truncate-ordered-pages.patch
vma-file-merge.patch
quota-lockfix.patch
quota-offsem.patch
dont-wait-on-inode.patch
Thanks.
