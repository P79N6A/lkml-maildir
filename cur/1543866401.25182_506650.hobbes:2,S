Once a subsystem has a subsystem tree (git or quilt) I basically never
merge anything which belongs to that tree.  It's always
	originator->mm->subsystemtree->Linus
If the subsystem tree maintainer wants to tell me "I can't be bothered
setting up a git pull for that, please merge it for me" then that's fine.
But unless I'm told that, or unless the maintainer is vacationing or totally
asleep or unless the fix has some sufficiently high obviousness*importance product,
I'll just keep buffering it up.
