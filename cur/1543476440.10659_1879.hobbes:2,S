I've used GCC's long long stuff, and found it acceptable but not great.
I was about to write about how terrible it is, but I just tried some
tests and found the code to be quite acceptable.
There are some optimisations it's not at all good at, but on the whole
it's ok.  I have written time critical code which uses long long for a
few things, where appropriate.  Then again, I did tweak the compiler to
produce better code in the cases triggered by my program.
Just don't expect to divide two long longs efficiently -- the ia32
doesn't have good hardware support for that, which is why it's out of
line.
