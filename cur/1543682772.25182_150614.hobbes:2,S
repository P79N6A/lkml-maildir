So far I've seen several people point to this, and I just now had 
the chance to test the advice.  Here are the results:
image:~# mii-tool -v eth0
eth0: negotiated 100baseTx-FD, link ok
  product info: vendor 00:10:5a, model 0 rev 0
  basic mode:   autonegotiation enabled
  basic status: autonegotiation complete, link ok
  capabilities: 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD
  advertising:  100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD flow-control
  link partner: 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD
That's the default.  OK, the hub thinks it's FD, the adapter 
thinks its FD.  Should be a match.  
Test with a large file transfer: 80 KB/s, about as expected (ie, 
the problem still exists.
Let's assume the hub is smoking something interesting and 
force HD.  (The hub is unmanaged, so I can't force it to do 
anything).
image:~# mii-tool --force=100baseTx-HD eth0         
image:~# mii-tool -v eth0
eth0: 100 Mbit, half duplex, link ok
  product info: vendor 00:10:5a, model 0 rev 0
  basic mode:   100 Mbit, half duplex
  basic status: link ok
  capabilities: 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD
  advertising:  100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD flow-control
OK, adapter forced to half duplex.
Test with a large file transfer -- no change, still about 80 
KB/s.
Let's try to autonegotiate for the same result...
image:~# mii-tool --reset eth0
resetting the transceiver...
image:~# mii-tool --advertise=100baseTx-HD eth0 
restarting autonegotiation...
image:~# mii-tool -v eth0
eth0: negotiated 100baseTx-HD, link ok
  product info: vendor 00:10:5a, model 0 rev 0
  basic mode:   autonegotiation enabled
  basic status: autonegotiation complete, link ok
  capabilities: 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD
  advertising:  100baseTx-HD flow-control
  link partner: 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD
OK, looks fine.  Test... no change.
I predict hardware swaps in my future when I get home.
Just for giggles, I'll try 10baseT.
image:~# mii-tool --reset eth0
resetting the transceiver...
image:~# mii-tool --advertise=10baseT-FD eth0 
restarting autonegotiation...
image:~# mii-tool -v eth0
eth0: negotiated 10baseT-FD, link ok
  product info: vendor 00:10:5a, model 0 rev 0
  basic mode:   autonegotiation enabled
  basic status: autonegotiation complete, link ok
  capabilities: 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD
  advertising:  10baseT-FD flow-control
  link partner: 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD
Low-and-behold, 1.1 MB/s!  
Note that this is supposedly a fast ethernet hub and a fast 
ethernet adapter.  The other hosts on the hub all think so.
I wonder if I'm plugged into a special port or something.  
I'll play with that when I'm near the hardware later on tonight.
Thanks for your help, all of you.  I think I have the answers 
that I wanted -- namely, it's probably not a kernel problem.  
I am unsure if this explains the NFS problem (ie, NFS breaks with 
v3 enabled), but since it works via tcp, I'm not of any mind to 
complain.  If anyone is interested, I can try without tcp but 
with the ethernet controller in better shape and see if I can 
still cause the same symptoms.
