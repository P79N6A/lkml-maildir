Here is preliminary data.  I have compiled the tulip driver in 49-2 as a
module for one machine to provide quick debugging.
Under the following conditions the tulip driver breaks.  Note these are
distinctly different but very related:
 - machine enters a sleep state, interface link state gets set down somehow
 - a human or daemon (dhcp) cycles the link state on the interface
Following either of these two actions, the module must be removed and
reinserted before the link state can be brought up.
This started with 2.3.47, Dave Miller's comment was "You must have a tulip
card" and it works fine in 2.3.46.  I will acquire 2.2 and try it.  I have
two machines with 2.3.47+ and one with 2.3.40.  The 2.3.40 tulip
periodically dies and requires the link state to be cycled.  Once it's
cycled it works again.
The machine that has dhcp on it is a router for the complex that runs a
tunnel over a cable modem to a remote server.  It is a P166, I used to have
an AMD K6 200 in it.
This machine with the module is a PII-300:
(link configured and set up, then set down, then set up again)
# ip a s eth0
18: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1476 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100

    inet 208.179.0.198/28 brd 208.179.0.207 scope host eth0
# ip l s eth0 down
# ip l s eth0 up
SIOCSIFFLAGS: No such device
# rmmod tulip
# modprobe tulip
# /etc/rc.d/rc.eth0
(everything works again, the result is the same with ifconfig and dhcp)

The configs are inherently the same save for the cpu and modules.  The
config file is located at

If there are more questions, certainly feel free to ask me.  I can install a
second tulip card in this machine and allow you to look at it if you wish.
