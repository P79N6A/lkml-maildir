I did and the machine made it through this time ( in 18 hours). The thing 
is that I skipped the LTP and crashme tests because last time, they 
finished in 8 hours succesfully and the machine only locked up after 14 so 
I thought that one of the other tests that were still running were 
responsible. 
In anz case, I don't have access to the box till thursday due to the 
holidays. I will re-run with all tests then.
Cheers,
