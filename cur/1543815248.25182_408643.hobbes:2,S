Hello all again,
this is one more shot about the v2.4.lastest VS v.2.6.lastest problems
that I got while updating. Follows both DMESG's. I'm running a
brand-new Slackware 10.2 distro, with the original kernel and a 2.6
kernel, recent compilation.
When I boot in the 2.4, I need to move the mouse constantly from the
LILO select menu to the login screen of the main console. When I dont
do it, even my mouse get working vertically, or simply dont work. On
2.6 doesnt matter I do, it doesnt work.
Ps.: It's a 5-button PS/2 (IMPS/2) Dr.Hank optical mouse. Do I need
any special config?
Regards,
jake.
