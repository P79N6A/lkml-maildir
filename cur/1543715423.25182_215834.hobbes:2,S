Yes, and I described that it will hang under the pre-Dec 5th BIOS in another 
mail.
I still have images of the buggy BIOS, and the fixed one on my hard drive.
They are also available at 
ftp://ftp.shuttle.com/BIOS/an35_n/
 as
an35s00j.bin (Oct 2003)
an35s00l.bin (Dec 5th 2003)
XT-PIC timer bug still remains in both versions.

workaround.  You can see the removal here:
