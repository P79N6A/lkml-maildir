Hi.
I'm getting lots of this on a computer:
VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for myprog.pl
VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for myprog.pl
VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for myprog.pl
....
VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for kupdate (just saw this once)
myprog is basically making lots of directories, and is not using lots of
memory. Here's the info from 'ps auxw':
USER       PID %CPU %MEM   VSZ  RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root       994 22.6  0.3  2568  364 tty1     R    Feb15 230:40 perl -w myprog.pl
It doesn't seem like I'm out of memory:

The kernel is compiled with the rh-7.0 kgcc (egcs-2.91.66), and I've
patched it to get raid 0.90 and reiserfs 3.5.29.
What's going on? How bad is this?
