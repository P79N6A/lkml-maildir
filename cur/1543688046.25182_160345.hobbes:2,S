Hi,
I feel sorry to annoy you again with my problem, but I can't imagine there is 
no way to know the accurate size of a recept on the serial port.
I'm trying to implement a network driver above this port :
	- I've done a raw read from 0x03f8 but it was not fast enougth (I'm working 
at 115200 bauds) ;
	- I've created a line discipline, but it can't (according to this mailing 
list) give me the real size of what was read.
Does anybody know a way to read from the serial port with speed and accuracy ?
I'm really confused because the serial driver on Windows can do such a thing, 
and, since I've no other way to find the size of PDU (CCSDS segments), I'm 
obliged to rely on the serial port to let me know that size.
Thanks in advance,
