This one let the block driver care about some concept of 'plug' when it 
does not need to do so.

This one looks like some 'queue empty' condition.

Absolutely NOT!!!!
One of them is just uselessly exporting the concept of 'plug' to block
drivers when it is not needed. This is kind of usual 'bad coupling' that
are either result of bad design or some start point of the messing process
that generally occurs with large software.

I can only disagree 100%.
BTW, it's time for me to give up this thread.
