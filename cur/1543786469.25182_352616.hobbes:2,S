Hi,
Here are a number of USB and PCI fixes for 2.6.14-rc2.  There's also a
patch in here to remove me as the I2C maintainer, as Jean is doing such
a good job that I don't need to be listed there anymore.  I'll still be
the conduit for the i2c and hwmon patches into the main kernel tree, but
Jean will be taking care of the full day-to-day duties of it now.
Below is the diffstat of the whole series.
thanks,
greg k-h
