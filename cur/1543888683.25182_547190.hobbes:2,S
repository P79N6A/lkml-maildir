What about modifying the existing fbdev API? You could start with one
fbdev device per CRTC and then add a new IOCTL to control the output
device. I haven't seen anything yet that justifies abandoning the
existing fbdev API.
Note that you could add fbdev API support to the radeon DRM driver.
Preserving the fbdev API doesn't mean that you have to preserve the
old driver code.
