Yeah, it was some Lenovo notebook.  Pavel is more familiar with the
hardware.  Pavel, what was the notebook which didn't save much power
with standard SATA power save but needed port to be completely turned off?

Well, both implement about the same thing.  I prefer software
implementation because it's more generic and ALPE/ASP seems too
aggressive to me.  Here are reasons why sw implementation wasn't merged.
1. It didn't have proper interface with userland.  This was mainly
because of missing ATA sysfs nodes.  I'm not sure whether adding this to
scsi node is a good idea.
2. It was focused on SATA link PS and couldn't cover the Lenovo case.
I think we need something at the block layer.
Thanks.
