Here is how it works at the user-level:
 - There _is_ a clone(), with the original interface.  However,
   this version only works when you create a new address-space.
 - There is clone2(), which adds the extra "size" argument.  This
   one works for all cases.

In my opinion, it would make sense for all platforms to support
clone2(), since it's more in line with the normal UNIX-convention of
specifying stacks as a memory-range (e.g., see stack_t).  So far, the
interest in doing this has been lack-luster (and, IIRC, Linus was
against it in the past, so I haven't spent a lot of effort on it).
