At least 2 AC97 slots must be active in order to capture 2 separate
channels (i.e. Mic1 and Line II). Hence, you will need to enable slots 3
& 4 for _stereo_ audio capture.
Mono capture (1 AC97 slot) of Mic1, Line R & L can be accomplished on
the WM9713 by mixing all the required signals into the Mono mixer and
capturing the mixer output with either the left ADC (slot 3) or the
right ADC (slot 4). The easiest way to set this up is to look at the
audio diagram on page 13 of the datasheet and run alsamixer to change
the mixers. alsactl can then be used to store your mixer settings.
