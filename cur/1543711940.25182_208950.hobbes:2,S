Hi, Alex and Thaly,
I wrote Cyrix/NatSemi MediaGX setup/driver in linux.
I can get ZFx86 CPU datasheet, and look at it, 
it seems similar to MediaGX, I think .
But datasheets is not well informative.  
I'm just start trying the CPUFreq driver 
and setup cpu codes. 
Can you wait and try testing my code?
And can you send me some informations?
I want results of 'lspci -v', dmesg of bootup, 'cat /proc/cpuinfo'.
I need a 'vendor id'  and a 'cpuid' of that cpu which is not on a datasheet.
