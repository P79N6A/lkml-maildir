I would say.. just print a very very nasty warning, wait 20 seconds,
and then pretend it was passed as x86
and then remove in the next release (assuming the code isn't too ugly)
other than that.. just break it now in 2.6.24; people at least remember
.24 as the release that unified, so they expect changes there... they
won't expect them for .25 or later
