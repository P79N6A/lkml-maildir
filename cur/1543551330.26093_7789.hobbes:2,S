I only see the problem on 2.4.0 if speed=4 (rarely seen)  or speed=8 (always) on
both a MATSHITA IDE CD-RW and a Panasonic CD-RW.
Works fine on speed 2, most of the time on speed 4, and 1 out of 3 CD burns
at speed=8.  Andre has a new patch that fixes this stuff, but it is not
in at this point.  You should ask andre@linux-ide.org
