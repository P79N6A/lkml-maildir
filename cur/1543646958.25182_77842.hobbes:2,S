Well, somewhat LSD induced. /dev/raw/rawN has a merit for shared disk.
Databases (Read Oracle) most notably need raw devices for parallell
databases. It would GREATLY benefit from a cluster aware fs with
O_DIRECT support, Sistina added that to their closed source GFS 5.x. 
Working with blockdevices are pure evil in my view anyway, but until a
OSS FS that is cluster aware are a part of a vanilla kernel, I'm afraid
that /dev/raw/rawN are a necessary evil
