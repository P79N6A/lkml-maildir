Apologies for slow (and somewhat unhelpful) reply.
I'm out of town from June 17th - July 8th, and won't have 
a chance to look at this until then. If you want something 
urgently, the patch I posted for -dj should backport pretty
easily, assuming the problem is the same, else I'll look at 
it when I get back.
