Its also used to avoid special cases elsewhere.

ide_default avoids a ton of driver specific special case code outside
of /proc/ide/foo/settings too. It isnt that simple, and I added it
originally to fix hundreds of weird little bugs and races. You also need
it for handling hotplug of devices.
I don't however think it needs to be any brighter than it is now. Driver
ordering isnt important, Linus was pretty emphatic that he a) didn't
care and b) wouldnt take patches to do any kind of rigid ordering when I
asked him (and for hotplug its pretty obvious why)
As far as I can see you either
1. Set up the queues and /proc when you create a hwif
or
2. Provide a generic function for each driver to call that does this
and/or undoes it. Since each driver needs the same code (default
included).
