Hmm, boosting_prio should be MAX_PRIO at that point. boosting_prio should
only be different from MAX_PRIO while a task is trying to lock a mutex - 
i.e. while it is in a *_slowlock() function.
On which kernel have you applied the patch?
I am looking at 2.6.18-rt6 and trying to see if there is a race conditions.
I can't see it that easily (or I would probably have seen it already :-). 
task->boosting_prio is not set when task->pi_lock is not taken. And then 
it is only set to something else than MAX_PRIO if task->pi_blocked_on is 
set.
