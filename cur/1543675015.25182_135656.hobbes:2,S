Well, what exactly do you expect to hear? There are about a million and one
possibilities about your problem. Most of them are hardware-related. Hoping
that you have already made sure that you have no defective RAM, controller,
mainboard or the like (unlikely since you mention two hosts) I would eliminate
additional risk factors like USB (always gives fun) and use the latest kernel.

Stephan
