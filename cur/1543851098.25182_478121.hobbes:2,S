Yes, each host has its own thread.  Ordinarily it would be impolite to
delay recovery this long, but I assume that since the card is wedged
there's nothing else it could be doing anyway.
Just for my own edification, what happens on the dual function (dual
channel) boards?  We have two threads there and two separate I/O
processors.  I assume a PCI error will kill both, do we need to do
something about this?
