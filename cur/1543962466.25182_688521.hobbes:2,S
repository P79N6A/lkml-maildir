The false positive is:
---
WARNING: Use #include <linux/mca.h> instead of <asm/mca.h>
#77: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/cpe_migrate.c:40:
+#include <asm/mca.h>
---
linux/mca.h is a different file than asm-ia64/mca.h, so using
<linux/mca.h> instead of <asm/mca.h> will cause build problems.

I'll use strict_stroul().

Do you mean a lock so that cpe_paddr & cpe_node are updated atomicly?
The hole being the new page is allocated on a different node than the
old page.
