sure - and i'm not arguing that noatime should the kernel-wide default. 
In every single patch i sent it was a .config option (and a boot option 
_and_ a sysctl option that i think you missed) that a user/distro 
enables or disabled. But i think the /tmp argument is not very strong: 
/tmp is fundamentally volatile, and you can grow dependencies on pretty 
much _any_ aspect of the kernel. So the question isnt "is there impact" 
(there is, at least for noatime), the question is "is it still worth 
doing it".

none of my patches did any of that...
anyway, my latest patch doesnt do noatime, it does the "more intelligent 
relatime" approach.
