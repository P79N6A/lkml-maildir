Much simpler. 
Take your favorite conversion and optionally a discussable
conversion. Now describe why mutex/completion/struct work can do 
the same and still reach the same level of safety.
Sth. like extending Documentation/DocBook/kernel-locking.tmpl
which still misses completions and struct work queues,
how all works together, possible nesting and so on.
It all boils down to discussion one conversion of each type.
If one could point me to such discussions in the archives 
I could write sth. up.
