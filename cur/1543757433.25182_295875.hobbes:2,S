Definitely not for this. The request to go to low power mode should come
from the other side - the bus the device lives on.

I don't think input devices themselves should be sending any requests to
the PM system at all, they should just pass the events to the userspace
and have that decide what to do with it.
Maybe a simple event handler like power.c for transforming key events to
power change requests for embedded systems makes sense, but normally
many more variables need to be taken into account, and thus userspace
needs to decide.

Well, plugging in a power cord is a physical user action much like
closing the lid is, much like pressing the power button is, much like
pressing a key is.
I definitely wouldn't want to see input to be a generic trasport layer -
it is not. But I wouldn't be opposed to pass some of the user induced
events through it.
