Subject: [PATCH 2/2] x86_64 irq:  Handle irqs pending in IRR during irq migration.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/2/253

When making the interrupt vectors per cpu I failed to handle a case
during irq migration.  If the same interrupt comes in while we are
servicing the irq but before we migrate it the pending bit in the
local apic IRR register will be set for that irq.
After migrating the irq to another cpu and or vector the data
structures will no longer be setup to handle this pending irq.  Then as
soon as we return from servicing the irq we just migrated we will get
a nasty: "No irq handler for vector" message. 
Since we do not disable irqs for edge triggered interrupts except
in the smallest possible window during migration I cannot avoid
migrating an irq in the unlikely event that it becomes pending.
This is because by the time the irq could no longer become pending
I have already updated all of my data structures.
Therefore this patch introduces an intermediate state that
exists soley on the cpu where we are handling the irq during
migration.  The irq number is changed to negative in the
vector_irq data structure.
Once the migration operation is complete we know we will receive
no more interrupts on this vector so the irq pending state for
this irq will no longer be updated.  If the irq is not pending and
we are in the intermediate state we immediately free the vector,
otherwise in we free the vector in do_IRQ when the pending irq
arrives.
