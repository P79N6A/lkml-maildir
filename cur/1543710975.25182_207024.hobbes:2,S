Your "what are the semantics?" arguments are mysterious to me, Horst.  I
don't know that unionfs is a good idea, but there are trivial solutions
to the problems you suggest.  The fact that a facility can be used to
create untenable situations does not mean that the facility is useless.

Only the topmost layer of a "union stack" should be RW.  If you manage
to write to an underlying FS, it is akin to writing to the block device
underlying a normal FS -- the behavior is undefined.

Given that only the topmost is RW, it Just Works.

The topmost entry wins.

If a directory entry is missing, the next lower layer is consulted.
Delete is implemented with "white-out" directory entries -- a directory
entry in the topmost FS which has special meaning, "return -ENOENT
immediately without consulting FSs underlying me".

The semantics of BSD unionfs are fairly well-defined and useful in at
least some circumstances.
