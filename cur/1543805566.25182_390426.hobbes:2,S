Not at all - /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0f.1/ide1/1.0/media 
tells that in my box. cdrom_id is, AFAICS, a way to find the
capabilities of the drive (ie, look if it's a cdrom or a dvd, etc)
You can get the info even with a fancy output:
root@estel# systool -v -b ide
Bus = "ide"
  Device = "0.0"
  Device path = "/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0f.1/ide0/0.0"
    drivename           = "hda"
    media               = "disk"
    modalias            = "ide:m-disk"
    uevent              = <store method only>
  Device = "1.0"
  Device path = "/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0f.1/ide1/1.0"
    drivename           = "hdc"
    media               = "cdrom"
    modalias            = "ide:m-cdrom"
    uevent              = <store method only>
I guess the cdrom driver could in the future be taught to export
more data (the previus cdrom drive is really a dvd drive...) to 
the sysfs interface to know if it's a dvd so that cdrom_id is 
unnecesary in some cases.

HAL tells you that the sysfs path associated to a device.
root@estel # hal-get-property --udi '/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/block_HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GSA-4163B-K01544H0250' --key 'block.device'
/dev/cd-rw
root@estel #
(yes, that "udi" path sucks)

Although that sucks, IMO the whole point of udev/hal & friends is to
be able to make programs work regardless of what the name of the device
is (or at least, if I had to use a program, I would like that the program
design is good enought that it just ask the system what cd recorders are
connected to the system).
