If you're going to be so picky, at least be accurate !!!
The checksum of the associated short filename is stored in the LFN
records, yes, but it is stored there INDEPENDANT of the LFN that is in
those records. Therefore the LFN and 8.3 filenames themselves ARE
independant of each other - it would be no problem to implement a
rename function that correctly renamed either the LFN or 8.3 filenames
without affecting the other.
Best wishes from Riley.
