I can corroborate this using different drivers (3ware in this case) with 
12 drivers and 4 backplanes per chassis most of our failures have been due 
to disks erroring out on the 3ware rather than actual failed drives. we 
pull the disks, test them and return them to the chassis as spares if 
they're functional. It doesn't happen that often but we have quite a few 
of these things now (~10TB) so it does happen.
