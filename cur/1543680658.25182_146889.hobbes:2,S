I almost forgot. The patch I started with had a bug in it. (This is in case
anybody is using that patch)
+#define USER_PTRS_PER_PMD(x)   ((PARTIAL_PGD && ((x)==USER_PTRS_PER_PGD-1)) ? \
+				(PTRS_PER_PMD-PARTIAL_PMD) : \
+				PTRS_PER_PMD)
I had to change this to:
#define USER_PTRS_PER_PMD(x)   ((PARTIAL_PGD && ((x)==USER_PTRS_PER_PGD-1)) ? \
                PARTIAL_PMD : \
                PTRS_PER_PMD)
before my change, it worked at 1Gig boundarys (ok, i really only tested at 0xc0000000) and
at 1gig + .5Gig boundarys (e.g. 0xe0000000), 0xd0000000 would blow up, and I think 0xe8000000
was leaking some memory somewhere.
Anyway, the math was backwards.

Thank you. The first time through, I was mainly concerned with getting it all to work. This time I'll
make it configurable.
