Yes, that is what I was trying to get at.

True, and I think we have pretty well established that this isn't the
cause of Andrei's problem, but I think we all agree it is *a* bug?
And surely Andrei's data corruption will be of the same flavour in
that test_clear_page_dirty somewhere is now stripping pte dirty bits
where it shouldn't? (because it went away after Peter nooped that
behaviour)

Hmm.. in that case will the pte still be readonly, and thus the write
faulter will have to try again I think?
