Sorry I made a mistake in the report.
I was still booting 2.6.21.1 - very sorry :(
The real situation is worse :(
2.6.22-rc3 (no patches) just hangs on suspend at:
Suspending consoles
console switching works but needs a hard reset to reboot.
2.6.22-rc3-skge (with Rafael's patches)
suspends to disk and powers off
wol doesn't work incidentally
resume resumes to the exact same place that 2.6.22-rc3 hangs at...
ie a non-responsive system saying
Suspending consoles
Note, in both cases I can switch VTs, the caps/numlock lights respond.
