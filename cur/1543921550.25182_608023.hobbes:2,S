~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Continuing with real-life kconfig fun, here's a fourth item that
people need to be aware of.
The construct:
if ARCH_OMAP
	source "drivers/video/omap/Kconfig"
endif
does not prevent kconfig from reading drivers/video/omap/Kconfig.
Instead, it make all config symbols in that file be dependent upon
the ARCH_OMAP symbol.  Adding a config symbol dependency like this
is a common problem that causes config menus not to be displayed as
they should be (not indented or not subordinate as expected).
