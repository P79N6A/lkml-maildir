What I proposed may not work so nicely as is. I remember when we tried
this before, that because __make_request lets go of the q lock, the q
can then be unplugged or it can be unplugged from __make_request if you
hit the unplug threshold so we would not be able to easily allocate a
cloned request from the dm make request callout and set it to the
request that is allocated in make_request. You have to do some surgery
to the make_request function to make this work.
Maybe your preallocted requests that are used from the request_fn is a
better idea.
