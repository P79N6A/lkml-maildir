This is going to be fun after all.
There isn't any way to tell a nohide from a non-nohide mount from the 
expots list.
There are inconsistencies with the contents of /proc/mounts between OS 
versions (perhaps kernel version).
There is no way to tell a nohide mounted filesystem from the output of 
/proc/mounts if it does happen to appear in it.
*sigh*
