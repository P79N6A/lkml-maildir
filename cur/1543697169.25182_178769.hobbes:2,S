Do the NDIS drivers work in 32-bit land? Some kludges do! They were
the real-mode DOS driver interface to MS-DOS. Now there is a kludge
on top of a kludge called NDIS-6. They also used the Pascal calling
convention which screws up 'C' code (you need an assembly wrapper).
They are a waste-of-time. Why would you clone a Microsoft interface
for a non-Microsoft Operating System when you can't allow such
junk to run inside the kernel anyway.
The problem with third-party binary drivers is not the interface
to the kernel. Linux has a public interface, well established
and well known. The problem is that any third-party driver can
completely f**k up the kernel, either by mistake or by design.
So the third-party drivers MUST provide source-code so they
can be fixed or made to behave if (read when) problems are found.
Cheers,
