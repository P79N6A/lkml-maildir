Andrew,
	The call chain to iova_get_pad_size() is like this
alloc_iova()--->__alloc_iova_range()--->iova_get_pad_size().
Inside the alloc_iova() we are rounding the size to __roundup_pow_of_two(size)
iff the caller of alloc_iova() request by setting size_aligned bool. And
in every call to iova_get_pad_size() we check the size_aligned bool before calling
iova_get_pad_size.  Hence I don;t see any issues. If you want I can insert a 
BUG_ON() statement inside the above iova_get_pad_size() function. 
Please do let me know.
thanks,
Anil
