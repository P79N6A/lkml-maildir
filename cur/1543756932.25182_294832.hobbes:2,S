If that's the case, it would make the kernel internals a bit simpler to
only take a "from" and "to" node, instead of those maps.  You'll end up
making multiple syscalls, but that shouldn't be a problem.

Requiring that the process is stopped will somewhat limit the use of
this API outside of the HPC space where so much control can be had over
the processes.  I have the feeling that very few other kinds of
applications will be willing to be stopped for the time that it takes
for a set of migrations to occur.  But, if stopping the process is going
to be a requirement, having more syscalls that take less time each
should be desirable.
