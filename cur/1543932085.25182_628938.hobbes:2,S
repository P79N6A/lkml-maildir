Possible timing differences would be what worry me. 0x80 is well-known for 
its delay purposes, and frankly, I dont believe that one type of machine 
having a problem, which may very well have to be categorized a possibly BIOS 
fixable bug, is enough ground for switching everyone over to a different port
It's enough ground to look at not doing outputs at all AFAIC but that's more 
due to the outb being somewhat cheesy to start with which using a different 
port wouldn't change. But, on the other hand:

The Intel PIIX/PIIX3 datasheet confirms that the data is of no consequence, 
but yes, most documentation talks about 0.
The PIIX/PIIX3 datasheet also says that both reads and writes flow through 
to the ISA bus, while for port 0x80 only writes do, and reads do not.
I do not know how universal that is, but _reading_ port 0xf0 might in fact 
be sensible then? And should even work on a 386/387 pair? (I have a 386/387 
in fact, although I'd need to dig it up).
Versus the out it has the al clobber disadvantage, but givne that we're by 
now seem to be talking about out of line switch() native_io_delays anyways, 
that's not much of a problem anymore...

For the boot code, I gather (which could I suppose then also plug in the 
delay port in the zero page or somewhere for use by the kernel proper? I 
don't know how/if these bits communicate).
But, well, _reading_ port 0xf0 sounds promising across the board and low 
risk replacement _if_ teh PIIX/PIIX3 behaviour is as guaranteed as the port 
0x80 behaviour...
