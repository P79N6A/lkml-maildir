Hi,

I've just updated the sard code for 2.3.36/7.  There's working code on 
	
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs/profiling
but I'm still auditing it for SMP correctness.  The kernel patch adds
detailed disk profiles to /proc/partitions, and the "sard" front-end
prototype user-mode code gives output like:
device     %util   qlen (ios:kB rd  ios:kB wr  ios:kB /sec) avwait (ms)
[23:44:00]
sda       48.01%   0.48   14:14       0:0       14:14      33.5
hda        2.79%   0.09    0:0        1:0        1:0       90.0
giving device IO queue utilisation, average IO queue length, IOs per
second (read and write) and kB/sec transfered, and average IO wait time.
I'll do a proper test on SMP tomorrow and post a final version.
