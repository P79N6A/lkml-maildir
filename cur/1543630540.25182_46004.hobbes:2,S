   A fix is to do the ipv6 initialization before ipv4 initialization.
   The included patch resolved it for me.  Please apply or suggest an
   alternative.
Ordering of object files does not guarentee ordering of initcalls.
The linker can legitimately move things around in the final object
which will change the initcall ordering, the linker will in fact
do this on many platforms for performance purposes.
This bug can only be fixed correctly in 2.5.x which has a
prioritization scheme for initcalls.
