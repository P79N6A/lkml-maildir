True for block ciphers, but stream ciphers like RC4 just XOR a key
stream into the data. It would be interesting to make that as fast as
possible (big registers?), which could be a win if the key stream is
computed asynchronously in some way (and RC4 is pretty fast in that
too).
Don't know if this would be really a win, though. Also the usefulness
of stream ciphers is limited (basically, the only level this works on
is from a TCP connection upwards).
