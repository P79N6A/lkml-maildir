I am not sure I understand you but no, del_timer{,_sync} is not needed.
__run_timer deletes timer from base->tv? list and clears 'pending flag'.
__del_timer_sync sets ->_base = NULL, but it is merely optimization.
It could set ->_base = base, but in that case next del_timer_sync()
call will need spin_lock(base->lock) again.
