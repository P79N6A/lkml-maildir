Hmm. So an atomic bomb is a nice solution to political problems, too?
But back to ndiswrapper: you cannot build anything you want to
distribute based on it. You won't get any help debugging problems with
it from regular kernel hackers. You won't even get help for
non-related problems if that stuff has ever been loaded into the
current kernel image from any kernel hacker.
So it's pretty far away from something you may consider for productive
use, isn't it?
