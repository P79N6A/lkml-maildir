I thought you wanted to address a regression vs 2.6.24?

^^^ add partial/remove partial is likely the cause for 
trouble here. 30% is unacceptably high. The larger allocs will reduce the 
partial handling overhead. That is likely the effect that we see here.

Duh refills at 50%? We could try to just switch to another slab instead of 
reusing the existing one. May also affect the add/remove partial 
situation.
