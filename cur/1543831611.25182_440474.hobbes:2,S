Andrey,
some people are interested by a network full isolation/virtualization 
like you did with the layer 2 isolation and some other people are 
interested by a light network isolation done at the layer 3. This one is 
intended to implement "application container" aka "lightweight container".
In the case of a layer 3 isolation, the network interface is not totally 
isolated and the debate here is to find a way to have something 
intuitive to manage the network devices.
IHMO, all the discussion we had convinced me of the needs to have the 
possibility to choose between a layer 2 or a layer 3 isolation.
If it is ok for you, we can collaborate to merge the two solutions in 
one. I will focus on layer 3 isolation and you on the layer 2.
Regards
