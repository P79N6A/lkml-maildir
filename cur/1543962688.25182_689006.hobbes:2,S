Subject: Kernel Bugzilla: Bug stats
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here some current numbers of bugs by subsystem and overall, in
bugzilla categories.
The number of open/solved bugs varies by subsystem, however, large
number of bugs is not always indication of bad maintenance. Some
factors are: "popularity" of the component and number of users, its
size etc., and also complexity involved, time and effort needed to
identify/solve a problem.
Dynamics of the bug resolution reflects quality and standing of the
module the best.
Are there any subsystems that don't have distinct category in
bugzilla? any missing components?
Are there mailing lists that need to be included as recipients to the bugs?
   Currently, bugs get auto-routed to:
       linux-arm, linux-ide, linux-scsi, cpufreq
   Not in the auto routing:
       linux-netdev, alsa, linux-usb, other lists that would benefit
from direct reporting.
   Owners: please create your list account in bugzilla if you'd like
relevant bugs to be posted to the list.
Note: Over time means since 2002-11-06, when the first bug was filed.
Some categories like Drivers, I/O, File Systems include very broad
range of components and therefore larger number of bugs.

Networking

597 closed over time
===================================
Drivers
505 open
242 were looked at within 2 months
286 closed in 2008
2938 closed over time
(worse ratio (open/looked at/closed this year) are:
  net 114/59/35
  usb 77/21/36
  fb  19/8/7
pci, wireless, input look healthy despite the number of bugs, they
solve more and faster, according to bugzilla).
==================================
SCSI
35 open bugs
14 were looked at within 2 month
37 closed in 2008
271 closed over time
==================================
DVB
47 open bugs
19 were looked at within last 2 months
18 closed in 2008
82 closed over time
==================================
Timers
10 bugs open
7 looked at within last 2 months
9 closed in 2008
98 closed over time
==================================
"Other"
71 open
29 looked at in 2 months
54 closed in 2008
671 closed over time
==================================
Overall:
1349 open bugs, 211 of them are regressions
353 looked at within last month
644 looked at within 2 months
10598 bugs ever opened
   4056 rejected
      2336 unreproducible/insufficient data
      1375 invalid
===================================
Note: "rejected" category skews the picture somewhat. Most of those
indicate invalid report, no actual bug. They still take up developer's
and maintainer's time, but they don't contribute to bad commits,
errors, etc and shouldn't count for stats of the "bugginess" of the
kernel.
