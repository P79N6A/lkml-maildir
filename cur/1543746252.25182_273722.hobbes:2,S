I agree, but it's good to add this for new files.

You are using a specific data structure that is only licensed to be used
in GPL code.  By using it in code that has a non-GPL license (like the
dual license you have) you are violating the license of that code, and
open yourself up to lawsuits by the holder of that code.
There, can I be vague enough?  :)
To be straightforward, either drop the RCU code completely, or change
the license of your code.  
Hm, because of the fact that you are linking in GPL only code into this
code (because of the .h files you are using) how could you ever expect
to use a BSD-like license for this collected work?
Aren't licenses fun...
thanks,
