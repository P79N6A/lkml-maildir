Please calm down. You apparantly already get worked up about one of the 
secondary problems. I didn't say 'sleeper starvation' or 'rounding 
error', these are your words and it's your perception of what I said.
sched_clock() can have a low resolution, which can be a problem for the 
scheduler. This is all this program demonstrates. If and how this problem 
should be solved is a completely different issue, about which I haven't 
said anything yet and since it's not that important right now I'll leave 
it at that for now.
bye, Roman
