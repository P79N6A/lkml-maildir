Hello,
I'm trying to write a tty driver and I'm using
http://lwn.net/images/pdf/LDD3/ch18.pdf
 as a guide. The sample tiny tty
driver includes the following code:
            for (i = 0; i < data_size; ++i) {
                        if (tty->flip.count >= TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE)
                                    tty_flip_buffer_push(tty);
                        tty_insert_flip_char(tty, data[i], TTY_NORMAL);
            }
            tty_flip_buffer_push(tty);
This doesn't compile against Linux 2.6.16 kernel I'm using, because
tty->flip.count doesn't exist anymore.
How should this sample be re-coded?
Thanks,
Jon
