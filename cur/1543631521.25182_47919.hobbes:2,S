Subject: Failure report with tridentfb, CyberBlade Ai1

I've got a laptop with a CyberBlade Ai1 chipset, and I decided to try
the tridentfb because XFree86 4.1.0 does not support this video device
decently.
Unfortunately, the fb driver doesn't do much better. I compiled it
into the kernel, and the kernel started loading under text mode, but
once the framebuffer driver loaded the screen's image turned into a
scrambled picture of the boot screen. I could type blindly to log in
and reboot, but the garbage on the screen was completely constant.
If you'd like more information or access to the machine, please let me
know :). I really want to have a decent video driver on the system.
(utterly OT question because I'm too lazy to make two posts: is anyone
working on agpgart support for the SiS 5591/5592 AGP chipset?)
