I would, if it goes all wrong, just copy all the stuff from NTFS over
network
to your home PC (linux boot floppy, NTFS r/o mount), use a windoze boot
floppy
to create FAT32 partitions, get a FAT32 NT boot sector from somewhere
(or use
the Recovery Console which I find great) and copy it back over network.
This should run without any serious problems.
