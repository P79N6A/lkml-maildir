The CONFIG_4KSTACKS is a more likely suspect than the preemption, actually.
When I read the post from Andrew I remembered some discussion about this 
and reiserfs, and searched my archives for it:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108680778325490&w=2
I would start with turning them both off to have a stable working system.
If after that you feel that your life is too boring and you want to live 
dangerously, you might try with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y. If you really want the 
full adrenaline rush, then go wild with CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL=y too :)
