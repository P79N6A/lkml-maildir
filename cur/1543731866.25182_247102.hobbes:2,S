I wouldn't trust it on a busy system yet -- it submits the command to 
the device without checking if there is a command already outstanding.
The patch could _definitely_ corrupt data or lock your hardware, since 
it bypasses the SCSI mechanism that ensures that only one command is 
executing at a time.
