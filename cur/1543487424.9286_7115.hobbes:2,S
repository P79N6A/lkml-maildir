one thing that automatically prevents editing (or corrupting) patches is
to sign the patch on the sender side. (md5 or PGP?)

i think added redundancy in the protocol also increases reliability. 
Instead of silently corrupting the repository, it will at least have a
chance to detect the conflict. (conflict here is not a 'natural' conflict
between two developers, but a conflict created by some other software
component/bug) [of course, if i understand it correctly, this is purely an
internal matter of the repository, so it's up to you.]
