Same symptom with a slightly different set of steps leading to the
problem.
 - boot / telinit 5 OK
 - su'd to get privileges
 - cat /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_wakeup_latency (showed 0)
 - echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_wakeup_latency
 - set RT priorities as before
 - started scripts to record data
 - system-config-soundcard (newline shown)
At this point, the system is locked up again with no response to any
inputs.
One thing I did notice from the previous test, I had two output files
from preempt_trace showing a couple minor (just over 50 usec each)
wakeup traces.
I have a few ideas to simplify the set up to see if I can get some
useful data out of the system.
