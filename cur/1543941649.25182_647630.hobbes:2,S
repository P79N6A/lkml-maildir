yay! Threw this into my setup. It built fine with the new option 
disabled and enabled as well. Unfortunately it said this:
[   23.509562] Calling initcall 0xc0c49e00: be_sleepy+0x0/0x170()
[   23.515837] PM: no wakelarm-capable RTC
[   23.517562] initcall 0xc0c49e00: be_sleepy+0x0/0x170() returned 0.
(oh, btw., a small typo: s/wakelarm/wakealarm/)
is "wakealarm" something generally available on PC RTCs? I'll try to 
look into the BIOS setup, maybe it's just disabled ...
