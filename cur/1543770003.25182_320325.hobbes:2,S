Hello Dick,

Ok, basically, the trick is that the BIOS knows how to access the
disk, and Linux doesn't because it doesnt use the BIOS ? Or is it
some more subtle (though I doubt) thing in which only a part of the
disk can be accessed by the BIOS.

Hmmm... I didn't know this part, thanks for the details.
So, it seems that I'm stuck with my binary module unless I can find a
way to tell the kernel to use the BIOS to access the disk ;-)))
Cheers,
