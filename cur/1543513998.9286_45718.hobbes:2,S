I understood there was already a flag proposed to indicate half or
full duplex, separate to the above?
 > And perhaps FULL-TO-RX and FULL-TO-TX.
If we're going to combine the two flags, I would suggest that the
following additional states be accounted for:
 e. RX-TO-FULL  - Switchback only allowed from receive mode.
 f. FULL-DUPLEX - Current behaviour, default state.
 g. FULL-TO-RX  - On switching to half duplex, the natural target
                  state would normally be RX, and if a TX startup
                  is required, that can already be achieved.
 h. NO-PORT     - The specified serial port does not exist.
That gives a total of 8 states, so no unused values.

That sounds like part of your particular line discipline, rather than
a generic part of all half duplex protocols?

So there's multiple senders on the other end of the wire? In that
case, each message will need to contain both the sender's and the
recipient's address - have a look at the AX.25 protocol, available
from...
	
http://www.tapr.org/tapr/html/Fax25.html
...which shows how this has been handled for many years in the amateur
radio arena. Alternatively, have a look at the various networking
protocols used within Linux itself - after all, as soon as you have
three or more systems connected to the same wire, you have a network.

That should be part of the RS485 protocol itself, in one of two
formats:
 1. Each packet forms a single message. In this form, the
    message format should provide delimiting facilities of
    some form, either specifying a particular character to
    indicate END-OF-MSG (CR or LF often used), or by using
    an explicit length field near the beginning of each of
    the various message formats (see XMODEM).
 2. Each packet contains a byte stream from a particular
    sender. In this form, there should be a particular bit
    or byte pattern that delimits the individual messages
    AND each message should contain BOTH the sender's and
    the recipient's address.
Again, refer to the sources mentioned above.

Neither do I, but I would assume that they will do a reasonably decent
job if given the opportunity. After all, that's the whole aim of
interrupt driven I/O in the first place.
Best wishes from Riley.
