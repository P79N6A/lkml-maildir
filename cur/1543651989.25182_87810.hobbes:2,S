Subject: [PATCH] fix file system corruption under load

When QA testing XFS 1.2 we observed in-memory corruption under extreme
load (fsx, usemem & bash-shared-mapping) when using block size < pagesizes.
In addition to some bugs inside XFS Russell Cattelan found a problem in
end_buffer_io_async.
The problem is that end_buffer_io_async sets the page uptodate as soon
as there are no more async or locked buffers, which is wrong if only
parts of the page are submitted for I/O (i.e. writes not on the page
boundary, etc..)
