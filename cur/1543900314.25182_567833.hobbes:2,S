The first and third of these are just simple Kconfig updates, and the 
middle one just updates the list of symbols which shouldn't be warned 
about in CONFIG_RELOCATABLE's absolute symbol check.  They're completely 
harmless but may prevent someone from generating an unbuildable .config.

This appears to fix a real bug; the only question is whether x86-64 
needs the same treatment.  I'm not sure if the original bug reporter 
(dave young) has confirmed it fixed his problem.
