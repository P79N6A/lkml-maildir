Greetings all -
May I ask how well the linux kernel supports an HP Colorado (2.5GB/5GB)
IDE/ATAPI tape drive?   I recently exchanged a Sony Superstation for one of
these and I would like to know what I can expect in terms of operation.
Unfortunately I was not able to buy the media at the same time.  I will have
to wait until Friday for that but meanwhile I was curious what others have
experienced with this unit.
Thanks.....
