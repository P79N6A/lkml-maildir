I think you mean "A... select B" is just a flavor of "B... depends on A".  There is one 
minor difference between the two.
If A is a driver and B is a library, then it's more intuitive to update the Kconfig option 
for A then it is to update the Kconfig option for B.  For example, if I want to add a new 
driver C that uses library B, I can just add this:
C
	select B
If I have to use "depends on", then I would have to change the Kconfig option for B like this:
B
	depends on A || C
And every time I create a new driver that depends on library B, I have to update that 
"depends on" line *in addition to* creating the Kconfig line for the new driver.  If 10 
drivers use library B, you'll have this:
B
	depends on A || C || D || E || F || G || H || I || J || K

I know a lot of people don't like 'select', but I prefer it over 'depends on'.
