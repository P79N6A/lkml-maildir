Both 2.6.5 and 2.6.7 will boot using the GENERIC IDE driver.  I haven't 
yet gotten any kernel to not lock up using the VIA driver.
On another note, I can't get ANY network card to work in this machine 
other than with the gentoo LiveCD;  tulip, 3com, RTL, eepro, smc..
The e100 driver even gives me this nonsense: "SIOCSIFFLAGS: Connection 
timed out" when setting the interface up.
The eepro100 driver says it can't initialize the 82557 and check that 
the card is in a bus-master capable slot.  Self test failed.
This is silly.  The same hardware all works with the LiveCD kernel, no 
boot options.
