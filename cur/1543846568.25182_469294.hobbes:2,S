No, this won't work.  Yes, I want signal notification as part of the
event handling.  But there are situations when this is not suitable.
Only if the signal is expected in the same code using the event
handling can you do this.  But this is not always possible.
Especially when the signal handling code is used in other parts of the
code than the event handling.  E.g., signal handling in a library,
event handling in the main code.  You cannot assume that all the code
is completely integrated.
