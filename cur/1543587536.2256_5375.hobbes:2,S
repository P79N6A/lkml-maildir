Sounds like we need a 2.6 fairly soon after a 2.5 rather than going on a 
complete development voyage around the world every 18 months...
Linus,
Can't we have a controlled  development tree branch for 2-3 months just to get 
the ReiserFS/LVM/quota/knfsd integration done _cleanly_ (this has significant 
short-term  benefits NOW), with the brakes on all other changes, and another 
development tree where everyone goes wild with NUMA/Networking et al., where 
the changes from the other get merged???

Any takers to look at re-bending the current LVM fixes, + the reiserFS 
snapshot stuff???.  From what I can gather people will ALWAYS be applying the 
pathes for this to the stock kernel source.
