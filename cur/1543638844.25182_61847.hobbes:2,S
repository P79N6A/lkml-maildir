I've never heard this explanation, but who knows??
I've heard of callback relating to RAS as a method of preventing
just anyone calling into a particlar RAS server.
Using callbacks, the server hangs up and immediately calls the
originator back to a valid, known telephone number.
Also allows the server to be billed for it instead of the caller.

Callback Negotiation with the Callback Control Protocol
The Callback Control Protocol (CBCP) is documented in
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/rfc/cbcp.txt
 .
CBCP negotiates the use of callback where the remote access server,
after authenticating the remote access client, terminates the physical
connection, waits a specified amount of time, and then calls the remote
access client back at either a static or dynamically configured phone
number. Common CBCP options include the phone number being used by the
remote access server to call the remote access client back.
