Which explains why downgrading the kernel solves the problem. (If it were a HAL or KDE/ GNOME problem then shouldn't downgrading the kernel *not* help?) Just thinking aloud ... 
I believe the problem is not that the kernel is providing an error, but 
that it is providing an error which is taken as "DIDN'T WORK THIS TIME, 
BUT TRY AGAIN" rather than a permanent error. Asking every 
media-consious application to be rewritten is perhaps not the best 
solution, either return another error, or return what application expect 
(non-error but no data??)
Changes which break a large number of applications are probably ill-advised.
