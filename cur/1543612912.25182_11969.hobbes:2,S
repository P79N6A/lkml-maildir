I see the same, though I have not tried to chroot.
It happens when I have run mozilla from a NFS mounted fs.
Both client and server is 2.4.16, but I have had this problem with older 
kernels. NFSv3 support is compiled in both kernels.
lsof and fuser reports that no files are in use, but I'm unable to 
unmount the filesystem. Btw. The filesystem is mounted ro. (and exported 
ro). The exported filesystem is a reiser-fs.
I would really be greatfull if this issue was to be resolved.
Thanks in advance
