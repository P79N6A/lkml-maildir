That wait_for_cmd_done() and similar functions in other drivers are called
let's say 3 times in interrupt handler or spinlocked routine and 20 times in
non-interrupts disabled nor spinlocked functions.
Spinlocked reqions are usually protected by spin_lock_irqsave().
So the code reads
	if (!spin_is_locked(sl))
		conditional_schedule();
This doesn't make the whole problem go away, but could make the situation a
little bit better for most of the time?
