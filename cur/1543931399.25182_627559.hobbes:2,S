The device is supported by b43.
The PCI ID is in the SSB PCI bridge code
static const struct pci_device_id b43_pci_bridge_tbl[] = {
        { PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, 0x4301) },
        { PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, 0x4307) },
        { PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, 0x4311) },
        { PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, 0x4312) },
        { PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, 0x4318) },
        { PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, 0x4319) },
        { PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, 0x4320) },
        { PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, 0x4321) },
        { PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, 0x4324) },
        { PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, 0x4325) },
        { PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, 0x4328) },
        { 0, },
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(pci, b43_pci_bridge_tbl);
