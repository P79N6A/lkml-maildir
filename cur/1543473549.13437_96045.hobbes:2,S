The "rdtsc" thing _is_ needed even for UP systems.
Look at the code generated for do_gettimeofday() some time - it's a
worthwhile optimization to do statically. 
(And if you wonder why I care about gettimeofday(), just look at the
system call distribution for a lot of programs, including most X
programs). 
As I mentioned in my email, it may be a valid thing to expand the choices
a bit (ie add a choice between i486 and i586), but the static "rdtsc"
thing definitely stays.
