Possible hardware problems?  Have you run memtest there?
Was 4KSTACKS enabled in those kernels (I think so)? - XFS
has one known problem with that option when running low on
space (patch fixing that is being tested atm) and I think
the reiserfs folks had some 4k stack issues as well at one
point, so that might be another explanation.
cheers.
