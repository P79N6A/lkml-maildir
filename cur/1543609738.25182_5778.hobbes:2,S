 Hmm, I must have written it not clearly enough.  Floppies are only used
because alternatives are rarely available and not because they are the
best invention ever.  If you had an alternative widely available, you
wouldn't care if it accepted old floppies, would you?
 Heck, I have a 5.25" floppy drive in one of my systems at home, yet I
don't complain no other system I have access to now accepts such media... 
I know no one who does.  Even though a few years ago this was the mostly
used removable medium.
