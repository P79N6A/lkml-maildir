I agree 100% with this.  I don't think <kernel>+<early userspace> will 
ever be smaller than the current kernel, but I have invested quite a bit 
of effort into it for exactly the reasons done above.
klibc binaries might not be what one usually tends to run, but during 
klibc development I could still use standard gdb, strace, and just plain 
"run it off the command line" debugging techniques from a full-blown 
environment.  When that doesn't work (like testing dynamic klibc), 
chroot will usually do the trick.  The compile-test-debug cycle is so 
much faster than for a kernel boot that it's just plain amazing.
