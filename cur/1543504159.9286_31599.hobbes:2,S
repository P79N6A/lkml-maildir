Hi all,
        I have ran into a wierd problem with 2.2.7. Here's the description:
When trying to generate traffic from a spoofed source address to a destination
on the same network it goes through. If the address is one hop further it does
not. tcpdump reports that the packets are being send. In real life they aren't.
Note: I am trying to test equipment/software and I need a spoofed source
address (this is not an attempt to kill somebody ;-)
Machibe:
Linux dexter 2.2.7 #24 Fri Jul 2 16:29:33 BST 1999 alpha unknown
kernel config:
        firewalling - enabled
        forwarding - enabled
        qos provisions - compiled in but not enabled
libraries are glibc - 2.0.7
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/ethX/rp_filter is 0 for the interface in question,
default is also 0, other ifaces are 1
Machine is: alpha LX 533
Network interfaces are: 2 x Tulip and 1 x 1GB Hamachi. The interface to which
the packets are to be forwarded is the hamachi
Any help shall be appreciated. I found one ref to a similar problem in the
list archive but there was no actual answer for it there. 
In btw: I asked a couple of people to try it on libc-5 systems with 2.2.7 80x86
and it worked.
