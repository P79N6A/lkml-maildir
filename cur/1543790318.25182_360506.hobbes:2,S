Yes, but I didn't expect that it would do that.  Why?  Because I asked
it for free space in the current directory and not at the mountpoint.
Since it's not _expecting_ subfilesystems to exist, it's
understandable that it did not perform well.

Of course it can be fixed.  Just always let it do
statfs(path_supplied_by_user).  If there are no subfses the results
will be the same.  If there _are_ subfses the results will be more
meaningful, not less.

Being a heuristic doesn't prevent it from being used.  And if you have
one subfilesystem with zero free space, and one with lots, you _will_
get burned if statfs() happens to report the zero space for every path
within the mount.

How will they give more confusing results?  Please ellaborate.
