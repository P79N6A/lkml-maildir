Do you have any benchmarks with this code running in TPM and non-TPM
mode vs. normal operation?
Also, your coding style has some issues (spaces instead of tabs), {} for
one line if statements, etc.  Please fix them up.
Also DO NOT USE PROC!  Please use the proper kernel interfaces if you
wish to dump loads of statistics to userspace (your own filesystem,
sysfs, debugfs (hint, hint, hint...)
Also, there are a lot more virtual fs in the kernel than you are
checking against in your "don't care about these files" test.  You need
to have a comprehensive list if you want to get it correct.
thanks,
