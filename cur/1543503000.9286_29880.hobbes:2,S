I believe the problem is that the BIOS really really wants to have
that last meg of memory reserved for itself, and it gets cranky when
the kernel overwrites what it's put there.

It sort of worked when I tried it a while ago. But it was certainly
better than no sound at all.
Unless IBM's changed the specs recently, the TP600 has a CS423[67]
sound chip in it -- it's definitely not a real soundblaster.
