What happened to the "if built as a module..." text?

Please provide help text for these options.

Why not EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()?  Based on the content of these drivers, I'd
feel better if they all were that way, but that's just me :)
Actually, why even have this function at all?  It's not needed, just
export the suspend, resume, and remove functions, and you are set.
Also, don't say that other drivers really support the other pci devices,
when they do not.  The MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() stuff needs to be in the
driver that actually supports that hardware.  Otherwise all of the
hotplug functionality will not work properly.

Um, why even have such a function?

EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() (same goes for all of these exported symbols...)

Please use better names for these functions.  That's very cryptic for a
global symbol.

No "tpm"?

Try putting "tpm" first here, for these functions, so the namespace is sane.
