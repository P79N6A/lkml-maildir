   I'd like to write the resource allocation helpers myself, but if you
want to work on the devlist/pci_ids thingy, you will be greatly welcome.

   The problem is whether we want to generate pci_ids.h automatically or not.
   One possible approach is to let pci_ids.h contain only device names really
used in kernel drivers and keep all known devices just in devlist.h and
use numeric ID's for them. This prevents us from including a zillion of
useless #define's in all PCI drivers and it also doesn't require extending
pci.ids by adding kernel specific names.
				Have a nice fortnight
