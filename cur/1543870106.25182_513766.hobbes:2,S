I've considered running NTP to synchronize the clocks, but I'm afraid it 
wouldn't help, for several reasons:
1) The 40.5 MHz clock used to timestamp datagrams at the source is 
located on a PCI board. I have read access to a 32-bit counter that is 
incremented every cycle (somewhat like the TSC on x86).
2) Source and receiver are inside a VPN, and do not have access to the 
Internet. I don't think I can keep NTP happy if it can't talk to any NTP 
servers.
(I'm not snipping the rest of the message in case someone is willing
to comment.)
