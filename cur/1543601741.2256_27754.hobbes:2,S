Interesting, I just experimented with it, bringing down the buffers to 
200ms (low as they'll go) and pre-buffer % to 0, does seem to have an 
effect, but it doesn't "fix" the problem for me... Should I just conclude 
that the tolerance for this is higher on some boards/chips than on 
others, and that once THIS problem is fixed, it'll go away and I can 
happily use my volume control again?
