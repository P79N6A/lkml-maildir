First, this isn't gconfig-specific.  xconfig or menuconfig should
have the same behavior.  At least I see it in xconfig also.

All 3 of the KALLSYMS kconfig symbols are under the kconfig menu
prompt:  "Configure standard kernel features (for small systems)",
which is not enabled in ps3_defconfig AFAICT (unless Geoff's is
modified from that I can see/test in linux-next).  All that you
need to do is enable that config symbol (called CONFIG_EMBEDDED)
and then you can modify the KALLSYMS config symbols.
HTH.
