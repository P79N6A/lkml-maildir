OK, this is consistent with the debugfs output - the inode was overwritten
with zeros.  However, I'm not sure how this would lead to EIO.  In my tree
(2.4.2) for ext2_unlink() we get EIO if ext2_delete_entry() has a problem
with ext2_check_dir_entry(), but that would have put another message into
the logs.  The other EIO (de->inode != inode->i_ino) happens before this
message is printed, so it isn't possible either.

Maybe you really _are_ having I/O errors?  That would explain the zero'd
inode table and the I/O error messages.
