Note that the kernel patch got dropped due to other concerns (the
non-real-time siginfo part of the patch made the task structure a lot
larger, something I hadn't initially realized but rth set me straight on
that. So the final 2.3.12 won't have it after all, and people should look
into which parts (if any) of this really _has_ to be in the kernel.
