Serves you right then :) Seriously, while the principles are there, I'm sure
there are more than a few bugs still to be shaken out of the NTFS write code;
that's why it's marked as experimental. Can you try 2.2.6? It has some updates.
I'll have a look at your oops and see what I can do, but I'm not exactly a
master hacker :(
There's a mailing list for the ntfs driver if you're interested in helping

To avoid the unclean reboot in this situation, unmount all your other partitions
by hand (+ remount the root ro)..
