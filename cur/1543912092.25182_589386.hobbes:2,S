Yeah, early_param is modelled on module_param which does more than the
naive substring match of __setup.  There's a warning in the header IIRC.
The original intention wass that everything would move to
module_param-style parameters.  However __setup is still useful for
trivial core stuff.

Indeed, it'd be nice to see this made uniform.
But this patch is fine.
Cheers,
