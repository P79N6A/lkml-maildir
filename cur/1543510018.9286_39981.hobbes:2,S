What is your compiler? There have been posts, confirmed by the EGCS/PGC
crew, that PGCC 2.95 can't correctly compile pieces of the Xwindows
system. If your using PGCC 2.95 then try running an Xwindows
built with EGCS (like the Redhat 6.0 I use). Because other than the
distribution, my system is almost identical to yours (FIC MB and K6 CPU).
