Subject: Re: [PATCH] KernelJanitor: Convert remaining error returns to return -E Linux 2.5.68

It was intended to do exactly what the KernelJanitor TODO and kj.pl script 
pointed out, but aparently there's more to it than that. (BTW it just says 
"sed s/return EWHATEVER/return -EWHATEVER/") Discouraging people with foul 
language isn't the best way to get more developers, this is only my first 
try.
