Hi,
The attached file updates Linux 2.5.3 generic HDLC, please apply.
The patch includes:
- new SIOCDEVICE ioctl for setting all protocol and hardware parameters
  of (HDLC) network devices, instead of using PRIVATE netdev ioctls
  (details in hdlc.h and respective hdlc_*.c and/or N2 + C101 drivers)
- the HDLC code is now split into hdlc_generic.c, hdlc_fr.c,
  hdlc_cisco.c etc. files,
- all protocol parameters (timeouts etc.) are (should/aim) now configurable
  via SIOCDEVICE ioctl,
- other updates and bugfixes,
- farsync update from Bob Dunlop,
- dscc4 update from Francois Romieu.
There is binary and source incompatibility with 2.4 version
- users require new sethdlc utility.
Thank you.
