As I send in my response Eric Biederman,

	Then you've started a new thread of discussion, because
device_shutdown is defined in drivers/base/power.c as:
void device_shutdown(void)
{  
        device_suspend(4, SUSPEND_POWER_DOWN);
}
	Perhaps device_suspend ought to be renamed device_power_down.
	However, I'm not trying to quash what you want to discuss.
I'd be interested in hearing about clarifications and perhaps
extensions of the struct device_driver methods, which I think is what
you're getting at, perhaps here or on linux-hotplug.  It's just that,
for this thread, I'm trying to focus on my patch that eliminates the
software suspend on reboot (pros and cons, alternatives to it, etc.).
