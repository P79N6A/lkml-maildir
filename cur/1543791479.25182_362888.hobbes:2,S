I can strip out the timer stuff.... without the frequency stuff the patch
is  an interface that allows userspace and other kernel code to adjust the
color and brightness of leds.
Then Richard can implement his triggers code, which uses the exported
in-kernel api for controlling leds.  That triggers code can do whatever,
including blink the led on a frequency.  (And the discussion of the
triggers stuff can continue unrelated to this basic led framework).
Now that I think about it more, the frequency stuff should really be
ripped out of the led code and put somewhere else (like either userspace
or some other triggers code).

I believe it is already solved this using my patch ignoring the frequency....
