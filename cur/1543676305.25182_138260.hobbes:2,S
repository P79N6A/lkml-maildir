Subject: [BK PATCH] More PCI fixes for 2.5.70
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
Here's some more PCI changes against the latest 2.5.70 bk tree.  They contain
the following:
	- fix up the fusion driver due to errors from my last round of
	  pci patches.
	- remove last direct accesses of the pci_devices variable.
Now the pci_devices variable is not exported for drivers to touch
directly.  Only the pci core and arch specific pci code should access
this variable.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/pci-2.5
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
