The patch worked great, my system came up beautifully. Len, it was so well done, and it was fast, too - thanks! I forgot to increase this parameter, but still collected a full trace with some extra IO-APIC snapshots. For now, I am attaching a serial console trace, and later will provide you full dmesg.

Yes, the IRQ schema you described was used on the ES7000 previously on 2.6. For example, the way interrupts looked with the old interrupt code (with irq_balance off, and my tweak for the IDE):
  0:    1566205          0          0          0         IO-APIC-edge  timer

  2:          0          0          0          0               XT-PIC  cascade

With your patch, it looks like this:

There were other strange schemas that I've used before in 2.4, mostly due to ongoing inconsistencies in the BIOS and ACPI. Those were eventually cleaned up and now I guess a general convention can be applied, even though BIOS-clean IRQ schema still looks pretty exotic, as you noticed... With this patch, it looks like everything's taken care off.
Let me know if you need particular debug done with this patch. I'll send you a dmesg you've requested with increased CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT shortly (as soon as the system becomes available today).
Thanks,
