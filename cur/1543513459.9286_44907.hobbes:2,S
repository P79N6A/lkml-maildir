I've been browsing through the mail archives and see talk of the DTC
3181 card but none of the newer 3191 card that comes with the Umax 2400S
(their latest scanner that's supported by SANE). Anyone know anything
about this scsi card and if any of the current drivers will work with
it?
Thanks,
Gerard
