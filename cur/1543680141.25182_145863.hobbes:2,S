You still seem to be having trouble with the idea that the sound servicing 
thread is a realtime process, and thus fundamentally different from other 
kinds of processes.  Could you please explain why you disagree with this?

Partly true, in that users should be able to supply the hint in some way, they 
desire.  However in this case - Zinf - the point is moot, because Zinf is 
trying hard to give the hint, but it fails because of above-mentioned 
braindamage.

The current scheduler, complete with Con's tweaks, is working very well for me 
in combination with "nice -something".  The remaining issue there is pure 
policy.  In that regard, I'm trying to find the most appropriate way of 
fixing up user space so that Zinf's SetPriority actually achieves its 
intended effect.  Running all logins at some setable non-negative default 
priority is the best idea I've seen so far in that regard, and soon my system 
will be doing just that.  I'll let you know if anything explodes ;-)
If there's a remaining fundamental flaw in the kernel scheduler, it would be 
the lower-priority process starvation question, which holds the promise of 
plenty of future lkml navel gaz^W^Wdiscussion indeed.

Daniel
