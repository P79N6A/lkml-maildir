It all depends on what you want to measure.
If you want to measure "how well will this work for me", then you need
a tool that generates a load that has similar characteristics to the
load that you are likely to impose on the system.
If that is large single threaded sequential reads or sequential
writes, then bonnie is a pretty good tool.  However, this isn't a very
typical load for me.
I have been using bonnie and dbench which can be found at
   
ftp://samba.org/pub/tridge/dbench/
I have heard that iozone is pretty good too, though I haven't tried it
yet:

If you are looking at software raid5 in 2.4, you might like to look at
    
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/wiki/?LinuxRaidTest
which has a number of neat graphs and links to some patches that make
raid5 in 2.4 much faster.
You might also like to look at Gary Murakami's page at
  
http://www.research.att.com/~gjm/linux/ide-i75raid.html
particularly if you are thinking IDE raid.
Hope this helps.
