My experience too, but I'm just an average end-user (sort of), not an
extra-paranoid admin of a critical machine. New features _do_ bring
risks. Are they being controlled enough by staging stuff through -mm? Or is
it now the distribution's job to to final stability triage?
It looks like Andrew Morton is playing the role Alan Cox had during part of
2.5: Checking/filtering/testing "not quite ready" stuff, when he was
supposed to be like Marcelo Tossati: Keeper of the stable series, don't let
anything too risky get even near it.
Perhaps the philosophy changed while I was away from LKML, that's why I'm
asking.

I welcome them, and surely hacking new stuff is fun. But 2.6 is not a
hacking series, it is supposed to (become) rock stable (soon?).

Expertise of the kernel hackers, hat off to them. Incredible bunch. But
there _were_ a number of "brown paper bag" releases too...
