I'm not a kernel expert, but that doesn't look right.  vm_offset was
in bytes, vm_pgoff is in pages (note the change in name).  So, where
vm_offset was an rvalue, you need to now say vm_pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT,
and where vm_offset was an lvalue, you need to verify that the code
was treating the rvalue as page-aligned and then say rvalue >>
PAGE_SHIFT.  If the code wasn't treating the old rvalue as
page-aligned, you're in trouble.
Does remap_page_range() still take bytes, or should it now be pages?
Looks like it's still bytes. . .
