Greg, this changeset should get ripped out and thrown away. Its wrong.
Its an API breakage and it is going to catch a lot of people. People
said at the kernel summit the sysfs had serious problems because of the
structure it exposes and you said you could use symlinks and the like to
work around it, or fix the code.
How about proving it or doing the work to make it possible rather than
continuing to break everything repeatedly.
