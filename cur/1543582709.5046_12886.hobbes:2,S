What is the platform ( x86, Sparc, alpha or ?)?  On sparc look in the
bootprom (ls /proc/openprom) that works regardless of kernel SMP status.
On Intel I think your out of luck, at least with the commonly available
hardware/software.  In theory there could be a bios-peeking structure in
/proc much like openprom that could give you hints...

Subject:  Detecting SMP
Hello. Is there a way, when running a non-SMP kernel, to detect or
otherwise tell (software only; the machine is 2400 miles away) if the
system has SMP capibilties? Would /proc/cpuinfo show two CPUs if the
kernel is non-SMP?  Thanks!
(btw, the kernel in question is a stock RH6.2 kernel 2.2.14-5, and yes, I
know I should update it anyways and that a SMP kernel will run on a UP
system)
