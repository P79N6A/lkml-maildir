Did you rebuild pcmcia after rebuilding the kernel?  In my experience
you have to, since the pcmcia drivers need to know about APM etc.  As
you may know, the pcmcia drivers are not part of the standard kernel;
you have to retrieve and build them separately.
I'm successfully running 2.0.36 and 2.2.2 with APM and PCMCIA on an IBM
ThinkPad 600.
