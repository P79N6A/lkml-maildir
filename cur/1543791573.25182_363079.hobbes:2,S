No. It's _not_ suddenly useful.
It might be something you _want_, but that's a totally different issue.
My point is that regardless of what you _want_, defragmentation is 
_useless_. It's useless simply because for big areas it is so expensive as 
to be impractical.
Put another way: you may _want_ the moon to be made of cheese, but a moon 
made out of cheese is _useless_ because it is impractical.
The only way to support big areas is to have special zones for them.
(Then, we may be able to use the special zones for small things too, but 
under special rules, like "only used for anonymous mappings" where we 
can just always remove them by paging them out. But it would still be a 
special area meant for big pages, just temporarily "on loan").
