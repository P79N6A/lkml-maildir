It is emitted with KERN_WARNING severity and is not necessary seen on
the console. Check you dmesg.

The kernel does not really distinguish between different hardware
manufacturers. It tries to recognize Synaptics, Logitech and Genius, but
it relies on mouse responses to various PS/2 protocol probes. Anything
that responds to IntelliMouse (imps) protocol probes but does not respond
to ImtelliMouse Explorer (exps) probes gets labelled as "Generic Wheel
Mouse".
