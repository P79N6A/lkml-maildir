You are preaching to the choir. When doing government things
we can't resort to logic, only "rules!" Here's an example
of why; We decide to use the latest kernel which, BTW, we are
not allowed to decide that ourselves, we would have to obtain
a consensus from lots of "interested" people, including the
people who move equipment into place (will a later kernel
weigh more? ..They need to know). The process of selecting
a new kernel could take a year. Then, it needs to be
re-certified, which could cause a few million dollars (I am
not kidding...there are people who, working out of their
YMCA rooms, charge the government $600 / hour for such
code-reviews, etc).
That's why we almost always try for a "permissive" change.
In this case, after verifying that the USB works on a
later kernel (it does), I need to find out what changes
were made to make it work and I need to incorporate those
changes into the older driver.
Adding insult to injury, I find that the driver was not
changed much, but the memory allocation scheme for bounce
buffers. To review this stuff takes a lot of nights and
weekends because nobody will give me a hint of the changes
made to make USB work. It's not in any "Changes"
documentation, but somebody knows --and they aren't
telling!
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
