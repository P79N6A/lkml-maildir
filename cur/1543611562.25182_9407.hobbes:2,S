Well, this is a stable kernel, and the patch does adversely
affect overall throughput.
There are two changes to the elevator in that patch.  One
is a modest speedup for all workloads which, frankly, I'm
inclined to drop.   The other is the part which gives the
improved responsiveness.
Being a cautious chap, I think I'll submit that patch, with
the default setting to "off", so there is no change to default
kernel behaviour.   Then people can run `elvtune -b' to enable it.
