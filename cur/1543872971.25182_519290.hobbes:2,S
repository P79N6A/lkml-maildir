Is that a PATA cd-drive?  If so, then you must have hooked it up
to the JMicron IDE controller.  That driver is just plain buggy.
I gave up on it for my own P5B-VM.  The libata version works better
than the drivers/ide, but I gave up on it and got a SATA DVD/RW drive.
Off topic:  do your USB ports power off when the system shuts down?
Mine don't -- the +5V continues on them.. I'd love a tip on how to
turn them off completely at shutdown.
Cheers
