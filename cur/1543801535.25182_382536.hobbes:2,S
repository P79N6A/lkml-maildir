Subject: [RFC] why all the patches get messed up here!!!

hi all,
May I ask why all kernel patches just get in here in the list?
I mean to say that isn't it better to have another list only for this
purpose and let this mailing list be a discussion forum. I login here
to see different issues. its a wonderful resource.
I understand that alot of code is discussed here but in case of PATCH
I think it would be better to have a separate archive.
No offence just wanted to ask
Regards
Nauman
