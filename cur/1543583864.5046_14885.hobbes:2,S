hmmm. I had the same things from vanilla 2.4.2 on my laptop but luckily it
wiped out non essential stuff. I migrated back to 2.2.18.
I assumed it must be something stupid that I am doing but I have yet to
find it.
details - ext2fs main partition went awol. Had to manual fsck with much of
the above happening and lost+found filled up with stuff. anything else on
request. Still hoping its something stupid my end but doesn't appear to be
DMA stuf... I don't know.
have fun,
