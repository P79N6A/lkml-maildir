	The socket buffers are not guaranteed to indicate a particular number of
bytes in a sense that it meaningful to the application. In fact, on Linux,
they don't mean application bytes.
	In any event, we aren't talking about any particular implementation, we are
talking about a standard. So what Linux does or doesn't do in response to
memory pressure isn't relevant. What's relevant is what the standard
actually guarantees and what the semantics of the protocols themselves are.
	UDP is not reliable. Packets can be dropped, mangled, and lost. Nothing in
POSIX prohibits an implementation from dropping a packet right before you
call 'recvmsg'.
