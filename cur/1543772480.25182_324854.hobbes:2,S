No. If you leave preemption off but irqs on, which is what is done here,
you get good, deterministic IRQ latencies but nothing for task-latencies -
actually slightly (unmeassureable I agree) worse due to the extra step
you have to go from the physical interrupt to the task-switch is
completed.

For me it is the _same_ thing. Equally bad. If preemption is off I don't
care if irqs are off.

Certainly not. I was pressing for priority inheritance forinstance. That
thing does certainly not make it fast, but it makes use of locks 
deterministic.

My idea was to split them:
 local_ are disallowed in PREEMPT_RT to catch code been made !PREEMPT_RT
suddenly destroying RT.
 raw_local_ is used all over in PREEMPT_RT core code.
 hard_local_ is the same as raw_local unless you configure for low IRQ
latencies (the original patch). Then it marks the soft-irq state.
Do you follow my idea:
I can persue low task latencies. You can persue low irq latencies and we
don't clash due to conflicting naming convensions.
