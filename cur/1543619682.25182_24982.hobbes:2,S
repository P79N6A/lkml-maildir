There is nothing easier to fix then this. You just have to grep for it, 
or just remove the declaration and wait
to be hit by this during the compilation. And most interrestingly this 
is *easier* then sending a patch!
A patch for this particular problem tend't to
1. Touch many things (however in a trivial way!)
2. Have spurious conflicts in terms of synchronization with the overall 
developement tree of the maintainer
in question.
Now dear linus tell me a better way to deal with *this* kind of problem 
then using CVS for example
where not a single man has the overall controll.
Yes my opinnin is indeed that in reality our problem is that Linus just 
doesn't want to give up
some kind of controll - no more no less.
