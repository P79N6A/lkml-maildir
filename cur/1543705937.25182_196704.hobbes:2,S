Does it? I would assume this to limit NFS_ACL_SUPPORT to y or n
depending on the value of NFSD_ACL. If should be y, m or n depending on
the value of NFSD.

That's much more elegant than my "handwired" version. But I prefer
select: NFSD_ACL and NFS_ACL are in different patches; with select, the
patches don't conflict with each other.
