Hi all.
I can't for the life of me figure out how one of my suspend2 users could
get this on a 2.6.9 kernel:
> Software Suspend 2.1.4: Initiating a software suspend cycle.
> ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [ALKA] BIOS reported IRQ 0, using IRQ 20
> ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [ALKB] BIOS reported IRQ 0, using IRQ 21
> ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [ALKC] BIOS reported IRQ 0, using IRQ 22
> ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [ALKD] BIOS reported IRQ 0, using IRQ 23
> APIC error on CPU0: 00(00)
> ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:0f.0[A] -> GSI 20 (level, low) -> IRQ 177
> ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:11.5[C] -> GSI 22 (level, low) -> IRQ 193
> Please include the following information in bug reports:

I know it's really no error (according to the code), but I can't even
see how the function gets called in the first place:
find -type f | xargs grep smp_error_interrupt
./arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:asmlinkage void smp_error_interrupt(void)
./arch/x86_64/kernel/apic.c:asmlinkage void smp_error_interrupt(void)
./arch/x86_64/kernel/entry.S:   apicinterrupt ERROR_APIC_VECTOR,smp_error_interrupt
Regards,
Nigel
