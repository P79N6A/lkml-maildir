Hello,
while solving a different issue, my colleague Libor Pechacek found a
problem with handling mmapped sparse files. If you mmap the hole insidea
sparse file and write to it, the data gets silently lost if there is not
enough space left on the underlying device.
I found a thread which touched this topic in December 2001 (sic!). I'd
like to quote an email by Andrea Arcangeli:

)
However, this is still not fixed - I am attaching a simple test case,
run it like:
$ make
$ # become root
# make check
IMO we should go with the SIGBUS solution, but I want to discuss it here
before making a patch.
