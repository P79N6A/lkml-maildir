So is that another vote in support of explicitly supporting multiple concurrent
freeze requests, letting them all succeed, and only thawing after the last one
has requested its thaw?  (It's not enough just to check SB_UNFROZEN - also need
to track whether any other outstanding requests to avoid risk of it getting
unfrozen while something independent believes it still to be frozen.)
