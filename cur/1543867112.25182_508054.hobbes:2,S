MVIAC3_2 doesn't enable X86_GOOD_APIC, try M686 (Pentium-Pro) - but that won't enable MMX and SSE (via -march=c3-2).
These CPUs support SSE2 too... there should probably be an option for C7 that passes 686/mmx/sse/sse2 to gcc. (The c3-2 option could even cause gcc to alter code for the C3-2 that's not necessary for the C7, but I've not checked what else gcc does with -march=c3-2).
Also, for the C7 you'll want CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK_* (Hardware Crypto Devices, Support for VIA PadLock ACE) and HW_RANDOM_VIA (VIA HW Random Number Generator support).
