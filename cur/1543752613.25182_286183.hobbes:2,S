But why the "stackable" requirement?  Why not just use the LSM interface
and be done with it?
Or do you want to combine this LSM with SELinux or any other LSM
(root-plug, seclvl, etc.)?  If so, that's asking for trouble (see the
stackable LSM problems that have been posted multiple times here, and on
the linux-security-modules mailing list.)
