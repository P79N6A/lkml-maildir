Alan,
mea culpa on this one - my problem appears to be with the only other
patch I was running - I believed I was also running it on ac3, but it
now appears that I was thinking of another box.
The other patch was corey minyard's "allow signal handler to not call
handler" patch that I was interested in seeing its impact on a
userspace project of mine. It kills gdm (at least with ac4.. maybe
others?)
thanks,
-Pat
