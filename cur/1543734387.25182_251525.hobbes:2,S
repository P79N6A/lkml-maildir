Only minimally, and providing the co-operation is easy the rest comes
out fine. We don't often get ide-disk and ide-cd people arguing over

There are lots of cards where you might need more than the basic
example. You need to know your own state clearly, you often can't
retrieve that from the card. You may also need to know the previous user
has left it in a sane state. That might lead you to say
	lock
		oldowner->release()
	blah
	unlock (&release_func)
so that the previous caller is told it is losing the lock and can
for example wait for its commands to complete.
