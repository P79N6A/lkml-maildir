If the directory the task is in has been deleted then what is its path
relative to the namespace ? This isn't theoretical because if your
security profiles work on the basis of this path but do not prevent the
deletion of the current directory or some node above it (or doing
mkdir/chdir/rmdir sequences) an app may be able to subvert it by doing
this deliberately.
