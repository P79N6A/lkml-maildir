Guys,
does anybody use interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&wqhead, jiffies); under 2.4.6 ?
It seems that after this call sleeping process is never rescheduled again.
Am I doing something wrong in my driver?

Knowing that wait queue was reorganized in 2.4 I declared queue head as:
static DECLARE_WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD(wqhead);
and then in ioctl routine
