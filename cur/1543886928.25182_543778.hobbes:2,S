While it is definitely a good idea, since it would reduce the
freeze_time, it also raises some concerns, atleast from cpu-hotplug
perspective. 
Having been through the whole global lock_cpu_hotplug()
and the per-subsystem cpu-hotplug-lock mess, I have observed one other
thing about these locks. Not only might they result in deadlocks, but
they also make code maintainability more difficult.
For eg, a function foo() which does 
for_each_online_cpu() {
	/* do something */
}
needs hotplug protection. Thus any call chain leading to foo(), needs to
have be wrapped with some sort of a cpu-hotplug-mutex. This is what made it
more difficult to maintain, since we had to audit everytime someone
creates a new call chain leading to foo().
With the "freeze-limited-kernel-threads" scheme, we would still need
to perform this audit, since we now have to freeze only those kernel
threads which *may* end up calling foo().
So at the moment, I have some doubts if this scheme would help us solve
the maintainabilty problem which the locks had created. It defintely
needs some more thinking.
That said,  I agree that coarse-grained protection, though is effective
may not be flexible and my not yield the expected performance.
Eg: Waiting for kernel threads to freeze, which have nothing to do with 
cpu-hotplug only mean more latency for the cpu-hotplug operation.
