Subject: [PATCH][RFC][0/4] InfiniBand userspace verbs implementation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here is an initial implementation of InfiniBand userspace verbs.  I
plan to commit this code to the OpenIB repository shortly, and submit
it for inclusion during the 2.6.13 cycle, so I am posting it early for
comments.
This code, in conjunction with the libibverbs and libmthca userspace
libraries available from the subversion trees at
    
https://openib.org/svn/gen2/branches/roland-uverbs/src/userspace/libibverbs
    
https://openib.org/svn/gen2/branches/roland-uverbs/src/userspace/libmthca
enables userspace processes to access InfiniBand HCAs directly.
For those not familiar with the InfiniBand architecture, this
so-called "userspace verbs" support allows userspace to post data path
commands directly to the HCA.  Resource allocation and other control
path operations still go through the kernel driver.
Please take a look at this code if you have a chance.  I would
appreciate high-level criticism of the design and implementation as
well as nitpicky complaints about coding style and typos.
In particular, the memory pinning code in in uverbs_mem.c could stand
a looking over.  In addition, a sanity check of the write()-based
scheme for passing commands into the kernel in uverbs_main.c and
uverbs_cmd.c is probably worthwhile.
Thanks,
  Roland
