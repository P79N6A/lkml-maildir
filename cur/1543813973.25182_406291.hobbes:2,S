Alright, I was just trying to make it clear that there are minor problems
with hotplug and some aspects of ACPI, PCMCIA, PNP, etc.  Some of the
exceptions (e.g. multiple PnP IDs) are more common than others (e.g. ACPI
_CID methods for non-acpi devices).  Also, some aren't difficult to work
around with things like the script that parses the "id" attribute.  I'm
interested in seeing how future solutions might attempt to implement these
features, even the corner cases.  I agree, though, that having a simplistic
default like the modalias approach has an important "real world" advantage.
Thanks,
Adam
