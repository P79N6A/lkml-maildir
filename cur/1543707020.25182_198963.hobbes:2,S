I have a register on my hardware that I write to to increment a counter....
..all I want to do is make sure that only one "task" writes at a time, 
thus to not corrupt the value......
=EXAMPLE
Task A
- Write new Value to hardware
- Increment Hardware counter
- DONE
Task B
- Write new Value to hardware
- Increment Hardware counter
- DONE
..This will most likely not occur in a inthandler, but may....
...I have to make sure that Task A is "done" before "Task B" or any others
can do their writing....
...any opinion of what I should use....
