Actually, I didn't break aperture.c by moving iommu_setup because I
moved iommu_hole_init after __setup.  This change also enabled me to
move back the calgary specific bootarg parsing (like you asked for in
the original version of the path).  
Also, in the reworked version of iommu-abstraction on
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/x86_64/quilt/patches
 has a bug.  When
iommu_setup was kept in it's original form, the "+__setup("iommu=",
iommu_setup);" wasn't removed, which gives 2 calls to the same function.
I'll send updated versions of the patches here shortly which will apply
cleanly inplace to that tree.

Sorry, I'll be happy to do it next time :)
Thanks,
