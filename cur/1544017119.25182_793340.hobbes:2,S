This thread is very interesting.
As far as I know, embedded guys strong want to lowmem notification mecanism.
At least, I and my mem_notify receive multiple contact from embedded
and JavaVM developer.
 (include sun javavm engineer)
In ideal, I think linux MM should care this requirement directly.
LSM and driver notifier is easy breakable because these component
deeply depend on MM.
(eg, I developed /dev/mem_notify patch last year. but this patch don't
work on 2.6.28 because
split-lru patch series totally changed MM reclaim processing.)
Unfortunately, we don't have any consensus of memory notification requirement.
various people have various requirement. so, if I can discuss it and
we get consensus, I'm glad.
