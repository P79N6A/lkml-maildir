I had to set the threaded softirqs to real time priorities with the hi 
thread at 24,
the timer thread at 23, net_rx at 22, etc.    I wanted their priorities 
  just below the IRQ threads.
  The problem was the timer thread.  Other real time threads got in its 
way and held off timers.
And I had to make a note if any higher priority apps depended on timers 
that the timer
thread had to be boosted in priority to match that real time threads 
priority.   It's like
the softirqd's timer thread needs priority inheritance.
