I'm getting the (now-common) sound-slot-? and sound-service-?-? messages
in my /var/adm/messages. Is there a place where I can look up the
appropriate mappings? Is there a central repository where I can look up
the appropriate aliases for a soundblaster, tropez and etc? In what
sourcefile are the services and slots listed or kept in? None?
In a related note, I once saw a conf.modules model that had multiple
aliases - for example,
 block-major-8  sd_mod ppa
which is exactly what I'd desire - since I need both to be loaded. Does
this work now (2.2.9?) I'm sure it didn't in 2.2.2.
