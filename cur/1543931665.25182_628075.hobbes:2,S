The reasoning behind the change was the first page encountered on the list
by the caller would have a matching migratetype. I failed to take into
account the physical ordering of pages returned. I'm setting up to run some
performance benchmarks of the candidate fix merged into the -mm tree to see
if the search shows up or not. I'm testing against 2.6.25-rc5 but it'll
take a few hours to complete.
