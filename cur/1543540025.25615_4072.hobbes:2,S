A number of people have suggested to me that using one of the automated
bug-tracking systems would be nice. 
I don't like using them myself, but some people do. Whoever would be the
maintainer (and hey, Ted has been around since pretty much the beginning
of Linux, so I'd certainly be inclined to trust him) would make his own
choice on _how_ he does it. A web-interface sounds like a good idea. It
boils down to how much work/help it is, and personal taste of the
developer in question.
