Not Alessandro but,
CC sets the CC makefile variable.  When the kernel build system goes to 
compile something, it doesn't call on gcc directly, but rather what the 
variable CC is set to.  By setting it to your gcc 3.3 compiler, it will use 
that instead.

note the case sensitivity, which tends to be somewhat of a pain for new *nix 
users.
