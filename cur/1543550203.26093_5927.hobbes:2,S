Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Background:
incoming/ was mounted via nfs.  An ISO on that directory was mounted via
loopback to incoming/en.  Then on the nfs server various things happened
that broke the nfs mount to incoming; specifically, incoming/iso was
created on the server (so that from the client's view there is the
server-side incoming/iso dir, and that directory is also the loopback 
mount point for a file on the same nfs mount.  Now when trying to unmount
the incoming dir, it says busy, since an iso was mounted from that dir.
Trying to unmount the iso was unsuccessful, presumably since that file
doesn't exist.  Now it just dies peacefully:
# umount /mrtwig/incoming/iso
umount: /mrtwig/incoming/7.0-i386-disc1.iso: block devices not permitted
on fs
but during the first unmount, the kernel was a bit more upset:
# ls -l incoming incoming/iso
/usr/bin/ls: incoming: Permission denied
/usr/bin/ls: incoming/iso: Permission denied
# umount incoming/iso
kernel BUG at /usr/src/linux/include/linux/nfs_fs.h:164!
