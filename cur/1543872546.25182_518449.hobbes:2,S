looks good to me.

what's the practical effect of this - when moving the last CPU offline 
from a node you got jobs migrated to really alien nodes? Thus i think we 
should queue this up for v2.6.21 too, correct? It's a NOP on systems 
that do not set up cpusets, so it's low-risk.
btw., unrelated to your patch, there's this bit right after the code 
above:
        /* No more Mr. Nice Guy. */
        if (dest_cpu == NR_CPUS) {
                rq = task_rq_lock(p, &flags);
                cpus_setall(p->cpus_allowed);
                dest_cpu = any_online_cpu(p->cpus_allowed);
out of consistency, shouldnt the cpus_setall() rather be:
		p->cpus_allowed = cpu_possible_map;
? It shouldnt make any real difference but it looks more consistent.
