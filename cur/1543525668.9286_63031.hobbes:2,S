Hi all,
Yes, another autofs 4 release.  No major changes, but there is a real bugfix
for people who use local symlinks; autofs-4.0.0pre2 onwards simply deleted any
symlinks immediately after creating them.
Background: autofs-4 is the next major release of autofs.  Its main new feature
is the ability to support "tree mounts", best known as "Solaris-style /net
automounting" (though the mechanism is very general).  Autofs 4 is backwards
and forwards compatible with autofs 3, but to use the new features you need a
kernel patch for 2.2.x kernels and 2.3.x (x < 41); autofs 4 is standard in
2.3.41 onwards.
News:
autofs-4.0.0-pre6: Since autofs-4.0.0-pre5:
-------------------------------------------
* Fix to auto.net to deal with mount options in the showmount output
* Don't delete symlinks after just creating them
autofs-4.0.0-pre5: Since autofs-4.0.0-pre4:
-------------------------------------------
* Updated header files to match kernel; fixes some
  protocol version confusion.
