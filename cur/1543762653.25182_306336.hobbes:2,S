I can confirm, I gave it a try and had to reboot ;)
You are right that the problem is only in the SMB_RECV_END and
SMB_RECV_REQUEST cases. I had missed that point in the patch I proposed.

Yes, after reading the whole thing again, it seems to be the correct
thing to do, providing that "should never" is a reference to an internal
state and not something from the outside. I don't know myself, but you
seem to do. Maybe someone from the samba team could confirm?
BTW, it looks to me like Urban Widmark, the author of this module and
supposedly the maintainer of it as well, has vanished some times ago.
Last seen 2004-06-21, and no working e-mail address (both failes for
me). Shouldn't we mark smbfs as unmaintained in MAINTAINERS, or have
someone else take over? Any volunteer?
Thanks,
