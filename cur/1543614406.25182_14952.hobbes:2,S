Yes, I know, and it's not only connected to X forwording, but also
(this is the majority of filed bugs) with ssh's exit behaviour
when any processes where started in background. However -- I've
got this problem with the running, interactive session. If I make
the server to send more than maybe 200 byte or so, the session
will hang, with both sides sitting in select, and data on the
server's Send-Q...

Well, my understanding is that, if there's data in any of the queues,
these bytes should be delivered. In this case, data is *not* sent
over the wire. Is this a kernel bug? ...or is data only transmitted
if we're in position to also set the PUSH bit?

Mine does:-( And this is quite annoying, because I'm to present
some software on the box in question in some days. But, with
no ssh on a (so far) headless box, I'll face some trouble...
