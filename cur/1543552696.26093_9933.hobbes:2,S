Hi Heinz,
it looks like the LVM snapshotting in 2.4 doesn't allow you
to create snapshots from anything else than the _first_ LV
in the VG...
I have run both the following command lines (after lvremoving
snap1, of course) and both of them give as a result that the
LV /dev/test_vg/swap ends up being the snapshotted filesystem ;(
# lvcreate -s -L100 -nsnap1 /dev/test_vg/test
# lvcreate -s -L100 -nsnap1 /dev/test_vg/swap
# cat /proc/lvm
LVM driver version 0.8final  (15/02/2000)
	<snip VG/PV info>
    LVs: [AWDL  ] swap            122880 /30       1x open
         [AWDL  ] test            204800 /50       1x open
         [ARDL  ] snap1           122880 /30       close
It looks like somewhere in either the utilities or the
kernel, the argument of which LV to snapshot gets mangled...
Oh, I'm using version 0.8final of the LVM utities.
regards,
Rik
