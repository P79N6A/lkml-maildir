It is used, I got some reports last year (but this card is only sold in
Portugal and is expensiv so far I know and so not so much people
using this card and linux).
Here 2 reasons why such thinks don't matter today:
1. 99% compile the ISDN stuff as module (and some parts are only work as
   modules)
2. In 2.4 the exit function is removed at compile time, if not compiled as
   modul.
I preparing lot of bugfixes for ISDN and 2.6, but testing needs much time and
many things are broken not only at compile time.
