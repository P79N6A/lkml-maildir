   Better fix is to verify len >=2 before half-word alignment
   test at the beginning of csum_partial.  I am not enough of
   an x86 coder to hack this up reliably. :-)
Further inspection shows that PII/PPRO csum_partial variant requires
even more surgery and is even more outside my realm of x86 asm
capability :-)
