I'm not 100% familiar with the exclusive vs. non exclusive wait thingy
but wake_up_page() does __wake_up_bit() which calls __wake_up() with
nr_exclusive set to 1. Doesn't that mean that only one waiter will be
woken up ?
If that's the case, then we lose because we'll have clear PG_waiters but
only wake up one of them.
Waking them all would fix it but at the risk of causing other
problems... Maybe PG_waiters need to actually be a counter but if that
is the case, then it complicates things even more.
Any smart idea ?
Ben.
