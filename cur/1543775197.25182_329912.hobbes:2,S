Hi,
I have a question about sysfs interface.
If you open a sysfs file created by a module, then remove it (rmmoding 
the module that create this sysfs file), then try to read the opened 
file, you often get strange result (segdefault or oppps).
I attach a small program to test it : open your sysfs file with it 
`wait_read /sysfs/file', rmmod the module, and press enter.
I was wondering if it is to user of sysfs to prevent that (with mutex, 
...) or it is a sysfs bug ?
If it is the first case, I fear that lot's of modules are broken.
Regards,
Matthieu
