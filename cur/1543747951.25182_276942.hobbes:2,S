It came in via the below patch.  I guess we need to find a different way to
fix this problem.

#   [PATCH] Close race with preempt and modular pm_idle callbacks
#   
#   The following patch from Shaohua Li fixes a race with preempt enabled when
#   a module containing a pm_idle callback is unloaded.  Cached values in local
#   variables need to be protected as RCU critical sections so that the
#   synchronize_kernel() call in the unload path waits for all processors.
#   There original bugzilla entry can be found at
#   
#   Shaohua, i had to make a small change (variable declaration after code in
#   code block) so that it compiles with geriatric compilers such as the ones
#   Andrew is attached to ;)
