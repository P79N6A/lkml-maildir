Subject: [PATCH] flush_work_sync vs. flush_scheduled_work Re: [PATCH] PHYLIB: IRQ event workqueue handling fixes

After reading this and earlier threads about phylib's way of using
workqueue I think such a lighter and safer wrt. locking alternative
for flush_scheduled_work should be useful, but maybe it's only my
imagination.
So, let's ask Oleg Nesterov, whose solutions are here only
copy-cut-pasted & possibly abused by myslef.

Subject: flush_work_sync as an alternative for flush_scheduled_work
Similar to cancel_work_sync() but will only busy wait & block
(without cancel).
