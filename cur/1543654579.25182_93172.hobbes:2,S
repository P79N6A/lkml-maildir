Performs the following code when io_apic is enabled.
tmp = 0x1f;
pci_write_config_byte (dev, 0x58, tmp);
Which happens to be a bad idea(tm) on my Tyan Tiger 230T (Via 691+686 chipset) because it will cause
one of the upper IRQ lines (>15) to trigger about 10M times / minute. In this case it's the ide
controller, but is seen on other devices too.
Things sortof work w/o the quirk.
What is going on here ? :)

Pretending to use the quirk....
leeloo:~# pcitweak -w 0:7:0 -b 0x58 0x1f
And just a few seconds later...
leeloo:~# cat /proc/interrupts
