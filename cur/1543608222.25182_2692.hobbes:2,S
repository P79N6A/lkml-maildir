RTFM of the maillists, Andi.
Someone promised me to fix this in right way, but disappeared.
Generally packet sockets MUST NOT tap on output packets. No differences
of socket of another protocols. UDP does not tap output right?
What the hell packet socket should do this?
Snapping on output is feature which must be regulated by a separate option.
And to be honest I see no tragedy, if this option will not exist for sockets
bound to specific protocols.
