Sam,
The problem is that we had our software working correctly with Linux 2.6.7
and when we started to get a flood of support requests from our customers, I
just pulled down the sources from kernel.org to see what might be the
differences and when you start seeing huge 12.8 Megs of differences between
2.6.5 from kernel.org and SuSE's 2.6.5 kernel, you start to wonder if the
problem is with your software.
The fact is that we discovered belatedly that the whole problem
was nothing but a broken build link to the correct sources makes my point
that a) there are no standards for shipping sources for out-of-kernel modules
to be able to build b) massive variations from the vanilla kernels causes
developers to have to keep doing #ifdef SUSE or #ifdef REDHAT or #ifdef DEBIAN
and #if (SUSE && LINUX-2.6.5) && !(REDHAT && LINUX 2.6.5) and so on....is a
cause for massive amounts of grief.
I apologize for not having the forsight to figure out that KBUILD was the
problem.
best regards
Dev Mazumdar
