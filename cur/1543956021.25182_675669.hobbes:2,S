I think that this is likely not a good approach for whatever you're 
attempting to do (and you would likely get better responses if you 
described what exactly that is). By the time libata or even the SCSI 
layer gets a write request, that is pretty well removed from the 
original file operation. They may be quite highly separated in time due 
to write buffering for one thing.
