Last time I believe I was the only one who asked whether to put it into
drivers/ieee1394 instead of another directory.  Of course I acknowledge
that everytime a new review round is started, people do reconsider.
Especially since we had a gap of a few months since the last LKML review.

I'm impartial to that.  Using same names might ease the transition from
the userspace side, as far as there is userland which relies on module
names.
A certain drawback of same names would be that geeks cannot install both
stacks at once during the transition period.  Therefore, checking
whether eventual problems are in fact regressions involves a module
unload/ configure/ build/ install/ reload cycle, instead of just module
unload/ reload.  This especially means we can only get help from testers
who are able to build kernels.
Other opinions?
