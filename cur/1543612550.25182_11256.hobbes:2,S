Greetings everyone,
	I've found out that NTFS and FAT are not affected
adversely by the atime update patch by Andrew Morton.
(atime resolution in NTFS is 1 hour and in FAT, well, 
1 day!). I'd be thankful if anyone could point out
which filesystems, if any, are _adversely_ affected by this.
	Thanks.
