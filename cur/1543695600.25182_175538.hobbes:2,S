Yeah that sounds right. This is due to elv-select.patch. Its
quite a rats nest in there though :(
What should be happening is blk_alloc_queue should register
the queue kobject, and blk_init_queue should allocate the
the elevator kobject (which should be registered in the process).
add_disk should just be taking a reference on the queue, and
add a symlink in sysfs to the real queue (I think). I have a
patch to do this, but it is a bit ugly because I don't know
where in sysfs to put the queue object.
Anyway, if this isn't going to be done before 2.6.0, I guess
Andrew you should drop by elv-select patches for now. That
doesn't fix anything, but it hides some of the problems.
