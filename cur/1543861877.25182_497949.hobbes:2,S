Whatever happened with Pekka's revoke submissions?  Did you lose
interest after
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/penberg/patches/revoke/2.6.19-rc1/revoke-2.6.19-rc1,
or was it decided that the approach was unworkable?
Now, what slim needs isn't "revoke all files for this inode",
but "revoke this task's write access to this fd".  So two functions
which could be useful are
	int fd_revoke_write(struct task_struct *tsk, int fd)
	int fd_revoke_write_iter(struct task_struct *tsk,
			(int *)need_revoke(struct task_struct *tsk, int fd))
Anyway I'll get going on rebasing Pekka's latest patch (pending
his reply) and providing the above two functions on top of that.
