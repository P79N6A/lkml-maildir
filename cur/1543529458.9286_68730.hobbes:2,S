You mean the entire block, right?  I'm not sure about blu3's problem, but
mine is only triggered if:
1) the cdrom is in the machine at boot
2) Yenta is compiled in (or just wait, it'll hit yenta_init and others I
assume later and do the same thing)
3) A mouse event occures and /dev/psaux is opened.
My keyboard is returned (with keys pending) when /dev/psaux is closed.  As
he stated, removing the card doesn't return mouse/kb.  In my case, it
doesn't matter if there's a card installed or not.
I'll try booting with init=/bin/sh (cdrom installed) and run gpm to see if
the same thing happens.
