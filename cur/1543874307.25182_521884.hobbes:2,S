Hi Alexey,
	I like the patch, but I wonder if passing the lengths for the symbol
and module name is overkill?  There are KSYM_NAME_LEN and
MODULE_NAME_LEN constants, after all, and we could just have the callers
use buffers of sufficient size.  Simplifies the code and reduces
confusion if someone passes a small buffer and it gets surprisingly
truncated...
Thanks!
Rusty.
