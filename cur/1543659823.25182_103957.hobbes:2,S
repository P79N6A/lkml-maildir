Hi all.
I've a question (maybe a stupid question!) about I/O access on ISA card...
I'm writing a real-time module/driver for an ISA card that simply put some
data to a 16 bit DAC... what I can't explain
myself is why the number of cpu cycle for outb and/or writeb is not
constant... if linux kernel is not preempive
why this variability ? maybe interrupt ? I think no cause things doesn't
change even if I add a cli() before the write.
Is there a way to reduce this variability ?
Thanks in advance and excuse my english!
