Subject: ia32 binfmt problem with x86-64

The 32 bit emulation for x86-64 has the following in 
arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32_binfmt.c:
#define elf_read_implies_exec(ex, have_pt_gnu_stack)	  \
  (!(have_pt_gnu_stack))
I guess it should be same definition as in include/asm-i386/elf.h and 
include/asm-x86_64/elf.h instead:
#define elf_read_implies_exec(ex, executable_stack) \
  (executable_stack != EXSTACK_DISABLE_X)
From the usage in fs/binfmt_elf.c it looks like the semantics of that 
macro changed slightly but was not fixed in all places (ia64 seems to 
have a similar problem from the looks of it).
The current behavior leads to 32 bit executables not setting the 
READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality when they are marked as requiring an 
executable stack (64 bit executables do however).
