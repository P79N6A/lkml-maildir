Very much understand :) Thanks for the testing!

Its a little after the fact (since things have already gone awry), but
it does show the multiplier is way out of bound.
I suspect the following patch will resolve it. The update callback
hasn't kept up with the changes from Roman, and is a bit useless anyway.
If the TSC is changing frequency, its unstable and we don't want to use
it, so lets just mark it as such and move along.
I'll work on a patch to cleanup the update_callback code, but if this
resolves the issue, it should be the safe short term fix for 2.6.18.
thanks again!
