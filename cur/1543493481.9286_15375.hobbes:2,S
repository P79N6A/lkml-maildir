Hello,
Are there some Means to guarantee a deterministic behaviour for a
soft-real time process ( response time ~ 32 ms) in Linux 2.2.x ?
( scheduler config, driver, ...) . Of "Coors" even with a loaded system
( i.e : typical App's like sound board, web server,mail server,...)
Any Idea or pointers would be greatly appreciated ?
TIA,
Patrick
