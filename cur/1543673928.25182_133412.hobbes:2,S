Chas, please update your tree now before sending me more
patches.  There were a few rejects when I tried to apply
this one (which I fixed up myself), for example in the
net/atm/lec.c diffs there is a conflict because the C99
struct initializer transformation had been done already by
a previous patch you've sent me recently.
If we want to continue to process patches at such a high rate
as we do now, you really need to keep your tree sync'd properly
when generating diffs.
