There's also 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/21/47;
 the included patch break 
my nVidia devices and probably all PCIX devices, so it's not right, but 
something has to be done to fix ATI. My guess is a quirk to say that 
pci_intx doesn't work on certain devices and should just be skipped, but 
I'm not sure if it's just in combination with MSI or not.
