IMHO, the glib developers are clueless, and the GNOME crew even more
so.  I remember when the gtk file selection dialog stopped displaying
files with "bad" names, unless I set some wacky undocumented
environment variable first.

I use utf-8 exclusively for my filenames (the few that are not 7-bit
ascii).  Forcing others who use the system to do the same would cause
them a lot of trouble, as they must transfer files to and from Windows
machines that use anything but utf-8.  The result is that some
filenames are in utf-8, some iso-8859-1, and some euc-kr.  As long as
these stay in each users' home directory, it all works quite well,
though.
