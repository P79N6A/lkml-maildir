Of course it is complexity! The size of patch is irrelevant. The issue is
that we've added another setting, yet another variable to the capabilities
subsystem. And it is an unneccessary variable.

If you are impatient for filesystem capabilities support (as am I), the
same effect can be achieved by using the libcap library from within
privileged programs. Using this method, or proper filesystem capabilities
when they become available, you get per-program control rather than
per-system
