Oops. We *do* have a race here. Scenario:
processes A and B share the files_struct.
process A calls sys_select() (which leads to do_select())
Big lock grabbed.
When wait table had grown to 4K we are looking at the next file.
Doing fcheck().
Calling file->poll().
Calling poll_wait() (i.e. __pollwait()).
Noticing that table is full.
Calling __get_free_page().
Sleeping.
Process B calls sys_close().
File in question is excluded from the files_struct.
f_count hits zero.
we block somewhere in __fput().
Process A wakes up.
And installs the pointer to the doomed struct file into the table.
Process A sleeps.
Process B wakes up and does its thing.
Process A now has a nice dangling pointer.
Notice that it doesn't require SMP at all - we can get into that mess on
UP box. I think that replacing fcheck() with fget() is the right thing
here. If you have no objections I'm including that into SMP-patch, OK?
