You're right, I had not thought about something like POSIX timers plus
sigfd().

Superblocks will be different, but their "fake" functionality can be
shared. A few parameters like file system name, file system magic number,
root name, ... will be able to do the trick :
fakefs_t fakefs_create(chat const *root, char const *name, unsigned long magic);
struct inode *fakefs_new_inode(fakefs_t fkfs);
void fakefs_close(fakefs_t fkfs);
