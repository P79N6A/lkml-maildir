	Details, please. In almost all cases when find(1) is applied to
really large trees it involves mode conditions (either -perm or -t), i.e.
lstat(2). What cases you are optimizing? And how are you doing it, BTW?

Or ls -l ;-)

Yes. I'ld still like to understand _what_ are you doing before commenting
on that. Are you sure that inode reads really dominate here? I would
expect large and nasty directory fiddling (quadratic by size) to take
quite some time...
BTW, lookup() is protected by lock on the parent, so that might be the
reason for contention.
