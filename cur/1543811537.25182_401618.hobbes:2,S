Is it the same files every time you mount/umount the image?
I think I've spotted an issue.
Both ifind() and find_inode() will call the test function on inodes
that still have I_LOCK|I_NEW set.  This means everything that the
test function needs _must_ be set in the set function (which is called
while the inode_lock is still held).
This could cause issues for inodes of 1 (only i_ino is getting set
right now).
However since you're seeing issues for inodes != 1, it could indicate
code elsewhere that isn't checking for I_LOCK|I_NEW.
Anyway, can you give the following patch a try?

======================================
Fill out inode contents in cramfs_iget5_set() instead of get_cramfs_inode() to
prevent issues if cramfs_iget5_test() is called with I_LOCK|I_NEW still set.
