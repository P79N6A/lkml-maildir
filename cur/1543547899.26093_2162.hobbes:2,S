Daniel,
very nice monologue, thanks. It would be great to know Linus' opinion. I
mean, I knew Linus' opinion of some years' ago but perhaps it changed? He
is a living being and not some set of rules written in stone so perhaps
current stability/highquality of kdb suggests to Linus that it may be
(just maybe) acceptable into official tree?
(hence I cc'd Linus, please forgive me (Linus) if you don't want to hear
about kdb again)
Regards,
Tigran
