Andi & Andrew,
The "x86_64-switch-smp-bootup-over-to-new-cpu-hotplug-state.patch" in
2.6.12-rc2-mm3 appears to have broken the NMI watchdog. Specifically:

This is wrong because in general the number of actual CPUs is _less_
than the number of configured CPUs (== NR_CPUS). Hence the code will
now check the NMI counts of non-existent CPUs, complain that they are
stuck, and disable the NMI watchdog. Actually the disablement is broken
in this case, but that's a different issue.
The error is easily reproducible by booting an SMP kernel on a UP box.
