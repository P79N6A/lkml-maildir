ARCH_HAS_foo are feature symbols, just like CONFIG_X86_F00F_BUG, so 
those are fine. They're just cross-architecture, but perform the same 
task: feature dis/enabling.  For the serial example, you'd just need to 
make sure the net effect of the code is the same, both before and after 
an x86 config.in cleanup.
