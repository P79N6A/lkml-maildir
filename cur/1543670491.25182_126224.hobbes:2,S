I know it _should_ to live in a nice and easy world. Unfortunately real life is
different. The simple question is: you have tons of low-level drivers for all
kinds of storage media, but you have comparably few filesystems. To me this
sound like the preferred place for this type of behaviour can be fs, because
all drivers inherit the feature if it lives in fs.

It should not predict failures, it should possibly only say: "ok, driver told
me the block I just wanted to write has an error, so lets try a different one
and mark this block in my personal bad-block list as unusable. This does not
sound all-too complex. There is a free-block-list anyway...

RAID-1 obviously ;-)

From the fs point of view it makes no difference living on disk or tape or a
tesa-strip.
