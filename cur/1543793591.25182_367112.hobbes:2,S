Ok, so we have fork code to dole out pid ranges per vserver, I see where
the app doesn't need to request a pid on startup.  But what about restart?
Surely the app still needs to be restarted with the same pid - just that
now we are more trusting that the pid remains available bc of the pid
ranges?

Note that while the patch is large, so far its main purpose is to introduce
a clean concept rather than hack the vpid idea in.  The latter has beem done
before, and only requires intercepting the points where pids go from user
to kernel.  This leaves the question of which pid is which more ambiguous.
