Hi,
Just had 2.3.99-pre1 lock up on me. The scenario was mounting an SMBFS
filesystem. As soon as the mount command went in the VNC session I was
using locked solid.
Thinking VNC had crashed on me again I tried to telnet back into the box
and couldn't. It was pingable and I got a connected message from telnet
but no response after that.
I rebooted the machine and repeated the mount command - it locked up
again in an identical fashion.
Sadly I have no logging info due to not configuring it correctly. I'm
going to patch to pre2 now and see if it happens again.
Martin
