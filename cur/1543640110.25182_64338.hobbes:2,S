Leave it alone for now.  I'm one driver away from per-disk gendisks
(i2o is the last remaining) and as soon as I'm done with it there will
be a lot of changes in that area.  I.e. tonight.
BTW, disk_name() and get_gendisk() will disappear from the export
list, being replaced by partition_name() (taken out of md.c, exported
and sans the "cache" - it doesn't give any benefits anymore).
