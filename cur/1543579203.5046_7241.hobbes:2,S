But it works on all ATA disks? Does it work for SCSI as well?
I think it would be cool if you'd make it available (on linux-ide.org?),
so that people install servers (and anybody who _cares_) could test their
hardware/driver combination before starting using the box.
Now we have memtest86, cpuburn (what more). It would be nice to have a
good (if not complete) test set to run on each new linux box. It's not
nice to use the box for a month and then go "f..., this box has faulty
memory!" or ..."faulty disk!". Yes, that's what's happened to all of us.
It's much nicer to get a warranty replacement, when you don't have any
data on the disk.
