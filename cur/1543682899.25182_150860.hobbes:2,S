Right, gkrellm does report some disk usage now, but it is far from
accurate. It registers barely any of the disk activity. Starting
Firebird or Opera may occasionally register one spike on the
graph. Mostly, the disk activity is not reported. 
This seems to be a gkrellm bug since vmstat reports disk usage more
accurately, although I haven't really looked closely at the output..
