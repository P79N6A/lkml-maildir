hi,
I found that those 3-argumented macros min/max in linux/kernel.h wont
only break my modules, but others as well, e.g. I tried to compile
2.4.9 with IPSec (Freeswan). It gives me:
  : make[1]: Leaving directory `/data/root/linux-2.4.9'
  : utils/errcheck out.kbuild
  : 
  : ***ERRORS DETECTED in out.kbuild (examine file for details):
  : radij.c:274: parse error before `__x'
  : make[4]: *** [radij.o] Error 1
"__x". does that ring a bell? let's please have min/max macros with
two arguments only as god wanted them to have and get rid of the
three-eyed zyclops, who only exists in greek mythology. for my part,
I will #undef min, #undef max anyway.
