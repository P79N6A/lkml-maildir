Actually, VMS doesn't do this, precisely because it is so hard to get
right.  VMS has both paged and non-paged pools for dynamically
allocated kernel memory, but the kernel code itself is non-pageable.  
The big problem with such pageable memory isn't really device driver
deadlocks --- the easy rule which makes that work is simply never to
use paged pool from a driver which might be involved in swapping. :)
Even more tricky is the handling of kernel locking --- you cannot
access any paged memory with a spinlock held unless you have pinned
the pages in core beforehand.
