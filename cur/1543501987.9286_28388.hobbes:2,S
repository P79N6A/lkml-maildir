Why the .dep files?
Why not the Documentation/ directory?
I guess these questions just about prove that Albert is right
in that there's no well-defined way to print the whole thing.
You have shown us a method of dumping the thing to the printer,
not a structure in which to order the thing for printing.

If the sections are fully independant, then almost by definition
it's not a compound document.
We're talking about compound documents here, leading us away
from the topic by asserting that you consider the kernel to
be a compound document is (IMHO) not proper netiquette.
OTOH, I do agree that people are getting used to having a
document consist of multiple files -- home pages have helped
user education in at least this aspect. Then again, why not
help the user by making compound documents available in both
ways?
