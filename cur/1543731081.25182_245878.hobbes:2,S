These features are available in patch-o-matic-ng. They're not in mainline
because the netfilter team only pushes well tested and non-intrusive changes.
But there are lots of people using features from patch-o-matic in production.
You can get those here :
    
ftp://ftp.netfilter.org/pub/patch-o-matic-ng/
Please also take a look at the mailing list archives since it's an area
which is currently moving :
