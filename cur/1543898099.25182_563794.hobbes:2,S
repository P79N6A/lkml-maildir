AFAIK, the driver authors are not working anymore with CinergyT2. The
last patch we have on development tree from Holger is dated as Dec, 3
2004. Since them, only internal kernel API changes and a few sparse
fixes from other contributors were applied.
Also, none of the current DVB maintainers seem to have any hardware for
testing.
Cheers,
Mauro
