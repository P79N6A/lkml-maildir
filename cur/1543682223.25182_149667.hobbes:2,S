Hi.
In 2.4, I ended up fusing the freezer and shrinking memory together. The
essence is:
freeze all other processes
while need to free memory
    unfreeze processes
    shrink memory until think we have enough
    freeze processes
Regards,
Nigel

You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless,
Christ died for the ungodly.
