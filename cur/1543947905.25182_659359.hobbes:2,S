Its not a ranking inconsistency issues the function grab locks of the
same lock classes triggering the warning.  The first lock grabbed is for
the constant reserved areas that is never accessed after early boot.
Technically you could do without grabbing the locks for the "from"
structure its copying reserved areas from.
But dropping the from locks to me looks wrong, even though it would be ok.
The affected code only runs in early boot as its setting up the DMAR
engines.
