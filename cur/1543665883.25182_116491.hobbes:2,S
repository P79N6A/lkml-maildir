Subject: [PATCH] ~/kernel/sys.c (2.5.64) (trivial)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/3/11/235

Apologies in advance if this is so trivial as to be non-patch-worthy.
Was poking around and noticed a possible improvement to kernekl/sys.c.
This change results in marginally better output using gcc 3.2 on x86.
As a test I constructed look-alike functions and a small driver.  There
appeared to be a ~40% speedup on the "true" branch and ~5% slowdown on the
"false" branch.  No effort was made to account for overhead when figuring
the percentages.
Unfortunately I don't know enough to say which side of the branch is more
commonly taken.
