This works for me on 2.6.7 as well.  However, I would get EBUSY back
if processes were hung doing nfs operations to the downed server.
The processes would get unstuck and get EIO, but the umount would
still fail.  Doing a 2nd umount -f with no processes waiting for
the server would succeed.  This patch retries force umounts in
the kernel an extra time after giving them time to wake up and
get out of the kernel.  It doesn't seem quite right to fail
a bunch of nfs operations and leave the file system mounted.
