Ok, your solution seems fine to me. In fact, with the old backend we
don't have guarantees that current hardware state can be read in
general; it just happened to be true for used hardware.
I just would propose to change the prototype of
int (*set_status)(struct backlight_device *, int brightness, int power,
int fb_blank);
to 
int (*set_status)(struct backlight_device *, struct backlight_status *);
This will allow adding new factors without changing the prototype
(thus without breaking old drivers which will simply ignore new added
factors).
I'm also not sure what should return
int (*get_status)(struct backlight_device *);
the brightness or the power status? Maybe it should be:
int (*get_status)(struct backlight_device *, struct backlight_status *);
