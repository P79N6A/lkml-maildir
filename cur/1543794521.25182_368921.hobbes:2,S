Appologies for the delay in responding to comments, but I have been en

As Paul suggested in his follow up to your mail, to even attempt a
"guarantee" that you won't still run out of memory, your subsystem does
need an upper bound on how much memory it could possibly need.  If there is
NO upper limit, then the possibility of exhausting your critical pool is
very real.

Your idea is certainly an interesting approach to solving the problem.  I'm
not sure it quite does what I'm looking for, but I'll have to think about
your idea some more to be sure.  One problem is that networking doesn't
have a specific "task" associated with it, where we could set a
memory_allocation_threshold.
Thanks!
