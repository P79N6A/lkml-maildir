That doesn't have anything to do with coherency as far as I can see.
It's just about the order in which a CPU (speculatively) performs the 
loads
(which isn't necessarily the same as the order in which it executes the
corresponding instructions, even).

Yeah, pretty safe.  I just don't like undocumented assumptions :-)
