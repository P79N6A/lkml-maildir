No worries. I should have mentioned earlier that the hid update
is best synchronized with the bcm5974 update, since the latter
is the only driver that will pick the mouse interface up after
the hid update. The bcm5974 patch was sent on October 23, but
I have not received any feedback to it yet.
Cheers,
