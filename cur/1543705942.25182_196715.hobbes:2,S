Thsrs is no way to tell gcc that an inline asm doesn't return. The only
way to do it would be to add something like a "for (;;);" (that gcc will
actually generate real code for) inside the BUG() macro, but I'd hate to 
do that.
Better to just initialize the variable to a default value and avoid the 
warning for now.
