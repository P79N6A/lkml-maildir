Oh, I got confused by the different emails:
   Documentation/auxdisplay/cfag12864bfb
does not exist. I meant
   Documentation/auxdisplay/cfag12864b
Also, in this patch:
    [PATCH] [119/2many] MAINTAINERS - CFAG12864B LCD DRIVER
You could add the same line:
   Documentation/auxdisplay/cfag12864b
As it is related to the same stuff: cfag12864b is the driver that
makes the LCD work along with ks0108; and cfag12864bfb is a
framebuffer to work with the LCD from userspace. I named it
"cfag12864b" because that is the name of the LCD, so people will not
get confused with the "fb".
As Documentation/auxdisplay/cfag12864b describes both at the same
time, it is OK to add them in both entries.
Sorry for the mistake.
