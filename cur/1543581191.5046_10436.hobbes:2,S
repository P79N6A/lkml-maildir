caching bmap() blocks was a recent addition around 2.3.20, and i suggested
some time ago to cache pagecache blocks via explicit entries in struct
page. That would be one solution - but it creates overhead.
but there isnt anything wrong with having the bhs around to cache blocks -
think of it as a 'cached and recycled IO buffer entry, with the block
information cached'.
frankly, my quick (and limited) hack to abuse bhs to cache blocks just
cannot be a reason to replace bhs ...
