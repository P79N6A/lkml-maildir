Which exact hardware is that, look for the skge line in the kernel log (dmesg)?
I am not a hardware wizard, but I wrote that comment. My guess is that it shows
up when the hardware decides to clock in some data that isn't really a packet
(line noise, etc). Both skge and sk98lin just clear the error and keep going.
Does it happen a lot or just once?
