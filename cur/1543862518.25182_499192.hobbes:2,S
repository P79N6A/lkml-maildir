Ok

Well, of course. But looking at the thread provided by Jan, it seems the 
kernel might not be in any fit state to service the (userspace) hotplug 
infrastructure when it makes the calls (Ie can't create pipes yet).
The kernel wouldn't call /init (or /sbin/init) before it was fully ready 
to handle userspace processes, so why should it feel able to call the 
hotplug userspace?
