	In case of using task queues for deferred processing 
	in an interrupt handler (isr), A task statically defined as type 
	tq_struct is usually used to queue for dpc by the call to queue_task().
	Meanwhile, if another interrupt occurs, the same
 	task can obviously be NOT queued again as long as the previously 
	queued task is not scheduled. Otherwise the scheduler will 
	go in an infinite loop. How do you guarantee in an isr that 
	the previously queued task is already scheduled ?
	And obviously, allocating memory for a tq_struct in an isr 
	is not recommended.
	Or should I maintain a list of tq_struct structures initially 
	allocated , 
	and pick up an unused one everytime an interrupt occurs.?
	How is deferred processing(bottom halves) using task queues
	usually implemented.?
	I cannot use bottom halves as I intend the driver to be a 
	dynamically loadable.
