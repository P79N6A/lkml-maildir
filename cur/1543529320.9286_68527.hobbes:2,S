Hello, I am part of a group endeavoring to add encryption to the Linux
network code.  If you are wondering why we are not using an existing
encryption method, this for a design class in school. The topic was given
to us by the professor.  
This encryption takes place in a modified hard_start_xmit.  In our
modified function the data field is encrypted and then the original
hard_start_xmit is called.  We have it working with a simple XOR
encryption, but this is kind of silly.
We have run into a problem when the useful encryption routines increase
the size of the data field in the sk_buff beyond the maximum allowed
packet size. (BTW, what does sk stand for?)  There are two methods we can
think of to handle this:
	a) Limit the size of any sk_buffs created.
	b) Split the sk_buffs up.
We don't know which method would be the best choice or even where to start
looking.  How can we limit the sk_buff size?  Any help would be
appreciated.  Also, any tips on splitting the sk_buffs up would be
helpful.
It will not be necessary to respond directly if you don't want to.  We
will watch

thanx for your time...
