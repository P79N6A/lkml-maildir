i believe it was the inb's dereference.
i dont have the oops around anymore, since serial logging is not working
;-) Had to write it down from screen.

will reproduce and write down the full oops - it was an illegal
dereference on 0xfffffff8 (-8 offset of a NULL pointer) or something like
that.
my serial setup is:
        append="console=ttyS1,115200 console=tty0"
old serial driver:
 Serial driver version 5.05c (2001-07-08) with MANY_PORTS SHARE_IRQ 
 SERIAL_PCI enabled
 ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
 ttyS01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
i'm pretty sure it hung when i echoed to ttyS1 - not 100% sure though.
