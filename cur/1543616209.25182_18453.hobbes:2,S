Yes.  It can also fix problematic areas which my testing
didn't cover.
Incidentally, there's the SMP problem.  Suppose we
have the code:
	lock_kernel();
	for (lots) {
		do(something sucky);
		if (current->need_resched)
			schedule();
	}
	unlock_kernel();
This works fine on UP, but not on SMP.  The scenario:
- CPU A runs this loop.
- CPU B is spinning on the lock.
- Interrupt occurs, kernel elects to run RT task on CPU B.
  CPU A doesn't have need_resched set, and just keeps 
  on going.  CPU B is stuck spinning on the lock.
This is only an issue for the low-latency patch - all the
other approaches still have sufficiently bad worse-case that
this scenario isn't worth worrying about.
I toyed with creating spin_lock_while_polling_resched(),
but ended up changing the scheduler to set need_resched
against _all_ CPUs if an RT task is being woken (yes, yuk).
