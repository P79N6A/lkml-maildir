Not necessarily. You can use 0 at the source level, but the compiler has
to convert it to the actual NULL pointer bit pattern, whatever it may
be.
In C++, NULL is typically defined to 0 (with no void* cast) by most
compilers because 0 (and only 0) can be implicitly converted to to null
pointer of any ponter type without a cast. 
GCC introduced the __null extension so that NULL still works correctly
in C++ when passed to a varargs function on 64-bit platforms.
(This just works in C because C makes NULL ((void*)0) is thus is the
right size. In C++, the 0 ends up being an int instead of a pointer when
passed to a varargs function, and things tend to blow up when they read
the garbage high bits. Of course, nobody else does this, so you still
have to use (void*)NULL to be portable.)
