It varies from 0 to some thousands,
depending on the policy supplied by the administrator and/or the policy appended by "learning mode".

TOMOYO Linux keeps the policy in CD-R's manner.
Thus, once an entry is written, it's pointer is valid forever.
TOMOYO Linux's simplicity (singly-linked list with no read_lock) comes from
this "keep the policy in CD-R's manner".
Yes, it is a kind of memory leak, but is controllable.
The kernel no longer requires memory after entering into "enforcing mode".
So, attackers can't do DoS attack after entering into "enforcing mode".
