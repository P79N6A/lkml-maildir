Also, at least in theory, open() can begin loading pages the moment it
completes (if the system is sufficiently idle). Calling madvise() "at
some later point" would allow a window during which the kernel could
already be loading the wrong pages, before it is *then* told "oh btw, I
really want *these* pages." As an example (assuming open() doesn't do this
already) I would be pleasantly surprised if open(O_RDONLY | O_SEQUENTIAL)
began loading at least the first page in the file the moment open() was
successful. Then, when we get control back to actually do a read() (we
may have been interrupted during open()) the page is already there.
