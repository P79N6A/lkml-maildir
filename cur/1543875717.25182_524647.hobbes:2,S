The previous case was clearer.  This isn't a please do some work
for me function, where we expect occasional failure and we need
to return an error code when there are different types.
There is only one time of failure here, that we don't support MSI
on this device.

Exactly.  Which just reading through is non-obvious.
if (supported())
   fail();
Where if we said
if (!supported())
   fail();
The code would be clearer.

But the callers all ignore so it still isn't useful, and I'm not 
at all certain it makes any sense for it to be useful.
