On the one system I have tried this kernel on, it hangs solid
just after successful DHCP negotiation (userland) on Debian-Sarge.
System is using SMP kernel on SMP board with a single P3-750 CPU.
Reconfiguring the kernel to exclude the net-filter stuff fixes it for me.
The 2.6.8-rc4 kernel was the previous version on the same machine,
and did not have this problem.
I'm kinda under deadline right now for something else,
so I haven't taken time to chase it any further.
Cheers
