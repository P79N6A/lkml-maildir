Argh, hoist by my own petard!  That is not the only problem - we also need
to represent 64K empty records for the index blocks.  These issues need to
be dealt with in order to go past 64K blocks, and then we have so many
entries per block we probably want to rethink the leaf format anyway.  OK,
just to handle the 64K case, what is wrong with treating 0 as 64K?
