  I would certainly return the board ASAP. The chances are that you have
a defective example rather than a bad design, but you might want to be
prepared for a brand switch if the next one doesn't work. But see below...

  I wouldn't say that even in jest. I sometimes question the competence
of those reviews, and often the relevance, but I think they're honest.
Possible causes:
  Power supply. BIOS option setting. Memory (memtest doesn't use the cpu
specific stuff to get the high data rate, at least my old copy).
Board I use:
  Abit KK266. With the Athlon optimization and 2.4.9ac14+patch. Runs
solid with 1GB RAM, high memory enabled, 1.4GHz CPU speed. And is stable
for 10% (146MHz FSB) o/c as well, so I think it's really stable.
