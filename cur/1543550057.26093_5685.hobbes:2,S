Subject: 2.4.0-test9-pre7 oops (Unable to handle kernel paging request)

I tried booting 2.4.0-test9-pre7 today on my work machine for the first time,
and it hung up when one of my user programs was started.  The process
"receiver_d" uses sockets and shared memory and has worked without problems
for years with many kernel versions up through 2.4.0-test9-pre5.
I did manage to get this program running after several attempts, so the oops
doesn't occur every time.  Here is a snippet from /var/log/messages:

I won't be at my work email until Monday, but can be reached at
elenstev@mesatop.com if anyone wants to cc any further questions.
Thanks,
