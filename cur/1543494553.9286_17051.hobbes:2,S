Ahh, I had forgotten that case. Although Andrea was certainly right about
the unnecessary test for PageCache - as long as we have any reference to
the page (and we just created a new one when we looked it up) the
PageCacheness can't change (anybody else trying to write to the page would
have COW'ed at that point).
