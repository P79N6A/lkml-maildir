debian has mounted the sysfs
/etc/rcS.d/S02mountkernfs.sh:
#
	# Mount sysfs on /sys
	#
	# Only mount sysfs if it is supported (kernel >= 2.6)
	if grep -E -qs "sysfs\$" /proc/filesystems
	then
		domount sysfs "" /sys sysfs -onodev,noexec,nosuid
	fi
	# Mount /var/run and /var/lock as tmpfs if enabled
	if [ yes = "$RAMRUN" ] ; then
		RUN_OPT=
		[ "${RUN_SIZE:=$TMPFS_SIZE}" ] && RUN_OPT=",size=$RUN_SIZE"
		domount tmpfs "" /var/run varrun -omode=0755,nosuid$RUN_OPT
		touch /var/run/.ramfs
	fi
	if [ yes = "$RAMLOCK" ] ; then
		LOCK_OPT=
		[ "${LOCK_SIZE:=$TMPFS_SIZE}" ] && LOCK_OPT=",size=$LOCK_SIZE"
		domount tmpfs "" /var/lock varlock -omode=1777,nodev,noexec,nosuid$LOCK_OPT
		touch /var/lock/.ramfs
