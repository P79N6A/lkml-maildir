Well, actually, he first wanted XFS style resource forks, and I talked
him into this.
We have to innovate in FS design.  For too long FS semantics design has
stagnated.

Yuck.  That is an ugly hack. Inheritance is worth doing for reasons other
than this.

I am not going to avoid innovating in the kernel just so that there is
more functionality for your FS to implement in user space.  
Just because /etc/passwd is not performance critical does not mean that
other applications aren't performance bound.
As for the general tone of your email, let me just say that I differ
from other FS designers in that I actually think that the features
application developers ask for are normally motivated by real needs, and 
that while I may distill their needs a little for them, I do believe in
listening to them.
Besides, the feature is going to be neat....:-)
