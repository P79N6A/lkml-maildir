One scenario which could cause this is if the application is writing a
large amount of data to a file and is repeatedly *overwriting* that data. 
And the application is repeatedly adding new blocks to, and fsyncing a
separate file.
strace might tell us that, if the traces are skilfully captured and studied.
You should try data=writeback.  Given that the app is using fsync() for its
own data integrity purposes anyway, you don't need data=ordered.
It's strange though.  databases often preallocate the file space, so a
regular write won't add new blocks to the file and won't allocate any new
metadata.  In this situation, an fsync() will only force a commit once per
second, when the inode mtime changes.
