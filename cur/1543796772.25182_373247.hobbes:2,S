Subject: [RFC][PATCH 000/002]  Add timestamp to process event connector message
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/6/3

	This series of patches adds a timestamp field to the events sent
via the process event connector. The timestamp allows listeners to
accurately account the duration(s) between a process' events and offers
strong means with which to determine the order of events while also
avoiding the addition of per-task data.
Series:
getnstimestamp.patch
proc-events-timestamp.patch
	The first patch adds a new generic function, getnstimestamp(),
which gets an SMP-safe high-resolution monotonic timestamp.
	The second patch adds a timestamp field to the events sent via
the process event connector and fills the field using the new timestamp
function. It alters the size and layout of the event structure and hence
would break compatibility if not incorporated with the first release of
process events connector in a mainline kernel.
Cheers,
