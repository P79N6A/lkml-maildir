It might be in the existing gcc for all I know, but there is no explicit
guarantee to that effect.  Remember that inline assembly is really
nothing but the guts of gcc exposed to the programmer, and that the gcc
people are very blunt about not wanting to muck with the former to suit
the latter.  This means that there are a lot of things that may
accidentally work in one version of gcc which breaks in another.
There are two documented ways to tell gcc that you're mucking with
memory, and those are "m" constraints ("m" read, "=m" write, "+m"
read/write) and "memory" clobbers; the latter which affects all memory.
