It sure is a std drive, Peter, although many of the later ones that were set 
up as 1.2 megger's by the pc crowd who have access to a 500 kilobaud 
controller, could have the 360 rpm spindle jumper'd back to 300 rpm, and when 
fed with a 250 kilobaud controller (WD177x/277x/279x family, which includes 
the Fujitsu MB8877), they are perfect 720k devices and are spec'ed that way 
by the makers.  Many of the older full height Tandon 100-4's could also step 
quite a few tracks closer to the spindle & I ran them as 765k drives by using 
84 tracks.  I even have a chinon that will make 86 tracks most of the time.
These were all quite common in the middle '80's.  Before your time I suspect.
