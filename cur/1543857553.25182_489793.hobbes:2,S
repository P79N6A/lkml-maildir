I think so, definitely; without proxy_pda you need to make it asm
volatile+mem clobber, which completely eliminates all optimisation
opportunities; in general the proxy_pda allows gcc to CSE and reorder
pda accesses.  I guess in this case the memory writes inhibited the
overall CSE of current, so its just making do by CSEing the address.

Might work.  But doesn't this make the pointed-at proxy_pda volatile,
not the proxy_pda pointer itself?  Should it be something like (volatile
__T * volatile)?
