Actually I have to disagree strongly on this one, bad API docs are
worth than no docs since it is often misleading. That said, stub API
docs might be a good idea.
I am not sure I as a code hacker would want to do all the docs, it
might be an interesting project for people who care a lot about it, to
make this their pet project. I can see the people who write code often
being reluctant to actually writing the documentation themselves, but
it is generally quite easy to fool them into explaining their code if
you ask them ;-)
