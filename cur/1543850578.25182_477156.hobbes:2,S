Can someone make sure Adam gets my email please?  His server rejects
messages from my domain:
  adam@yggdrasil.com
    SMTP error from remote mail server after MAIL FROM:<rmk+adam=yggdrasil.com@arm.linux.org.uk> SIZE=3022:
    host yggdrasil.com [61.49.148.168]: 553 5.1.8 <rmk+adam=yggdrasil.com@arm.linux.org.uk>... Domain of sender address rmk+adam=yggdrasil.com@arm.linux.org.uk does not exist
(the error is obviously utter rubbish.)
Thanks.
