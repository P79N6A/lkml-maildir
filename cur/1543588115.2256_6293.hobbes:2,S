The only reason for using file descriptors is that we can (AFAICS)
avoid any magic operations or new kinds of files. Honest-to-$DEITY
read() and write() on real pipes seems to be enough to implement
contention case for simple semaphores.
I see your point re sequential allocation of descriptors, but I'm not
sure that it's that serious - we need that stuff only for multi-threaded
programs and in that case we can't rely on sequentially allocated
descriptors anyway - stuff from different threads gets mixed together.
I certainly agree that introducing ioctl() in _any_ API is a shootable
offense. However, I wonder whether we really need any kernel changes
at all.
