   Has something changed? Last I looked, the whole lmbench timing harness
   was based on using the FPU.
Oops, that's entirely possible...
But things are usually layed out like this:
	capture_start_time();
	context_switch_N_times();
	capture_end_time();
So the FPU hit is only before/after the runs, not during each and
every iteration.
Franks a lot,
