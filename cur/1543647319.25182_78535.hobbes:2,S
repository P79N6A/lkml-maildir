Subject: Why NFS server does not pass lock requests via VFS lock() op?

Could anyone remind me of why NFS kernel would not pass byte range lock
requests to the underlying filsystem at the server side?
I think another person at IBM (Brian?) submitted a patch for this but such
patch never got included in the distribution.
I think a patch to pass lock requests to the underlying filesystem does not
affect single node NFS servers and it enables us to
support clustered Linux-based NAS heads over distributed file systems.
