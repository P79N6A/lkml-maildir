Who should get down? It seems no serious kernel developer cares enough
to get to it. It's just a desktop feature you know - no big iron - 
uninteresting.

Swap prefetch and those mystic _costs_. But nobody
hasn't communicated loud and clear what those costs are. I imagine
it must be really hard to fight to something you don't even exists.
Or prove that you are better than somebody you have never seen or heard of.
Please somebody qualified, take the time, dig that code, and show us 
those costs.
With details. So Con can make the code even better and included in 
mainline or
drop altogether if it's really bad and move on to other endeavours.
With best,
Lenar
