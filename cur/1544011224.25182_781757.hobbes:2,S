Don't give up yet :-)
As v4l isn't the only kernel subsystem wrongly using cdev (Hans showed that sg 
also suffered from race conditions), people seem not to understand cdev 
properly. Maybe you should start by explaining what cdev has been designed to 
handle and how to use it in device drivers (such as sg or v4l) instead of 
telling us what not to do.
