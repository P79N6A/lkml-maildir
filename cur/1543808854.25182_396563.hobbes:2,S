Jorg,
thanks for your answer.
I fail to understand how it is connected to my proposal. Maybe we
misunderstood each other.
I assume that you refer to the sformat/fmt.c implementation (sformat
3.5) being reproduced in cdrecord/scsi_scan.c (latest cdrtools).
Could you please elaborate on:
- what does the sformat scanbus code has to do with my proposal, whose
changes would mostly be located in the libscg modules, not in the
cdrecord module
- why 'it' doesn't clearly work on Linux. cdrecord clearly creates
this os specific to b,t,l mapping (e.g. in scsi-linux-ata.c,
scsi-wnt.c etc..). Why this mapping cannot be publicised in a
parseable format?
Jerome, still looking for a compromise.
