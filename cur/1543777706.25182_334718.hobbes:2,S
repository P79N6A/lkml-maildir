Hi Ingo,
(I searched the list for rt realtime x86_64 x86-64 before posting this, so I 
hope it's not a duplicate).
I've noticed -31 compiles without notable error or warning on x86-64, so I 
thought maybe it was a valid time to file a bug report about it not working.
The machine currently runs 2.6.12 but when booting with PREEMPT_RT mode on the 
same machine I get:
init[1]: segfault at ffffffff8010e9c4 rip ffffffff8010e9c4 rsp 
00007fffffe28018
[...]
Which repeats indefinitely (presumably the kernel tries repeatedly to spawn 
it). I've booted without quiet and a broken root= and the kernel doesn't seem 
to complain about ANYTHING, so this must be a bug.
Any ideas?

Alistair.
