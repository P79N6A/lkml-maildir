Looks like some form of underflow to me...
Note that ( (2^32 -1) / 100 ) / 100 = 429,496.7295 and that's not much
larger than the value quoted...
Before anybody asks, take a 32-bit unsigned field and put -1 in it,
and you get 2^32-1 which you then divide by HZ=100 and then by 100 to
get percent...
Best wishes from Riley.
