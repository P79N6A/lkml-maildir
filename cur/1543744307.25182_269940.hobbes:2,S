Hi,
I am interested in the way memory management is implemented on x86,
specially the low level part.
I search: where physical address are computed when a new Frame new to
be allocated but I can't find out. (alogithm to find out the next
frame free?? other the next frame to reuse??)
Please, can somebody  familiar with the code point me to very prescise
function, or give me some hint.
Thanks in advance,
Sylvain
