Suggestion: Chop your CCs. I sus pect Linus gave up on this topic a long time
ago, as (most likely) have the majority of the others.

No, they're not (taught to write Japanese in Romaji, that is).

Well, it rather depends on the person... try setting your locale to
ja_JP.eucJP, and you might be surprised by the applications that give you
Japanese messages. Certainly, some Japanese people prefer messages in
English, but that can hardly be generalized across the entire userbase.

My only answer is, you have only had the opportunity to meet people from
overseas who have some English ability... really, your argument is on the same
level as "I've got lots of foreign friends who all like <whatever>, so all
foreigners must like <whatever>."

PS: I'm against translating kernel messages, but for technical reasons (simple
== good) rather than some wild idea that everybody else in the world can
understand English.
