Oh well I don't use any PCMCIA stuff, I've only tested the 
"new init scheme breaks aha152x.c" patch on my system also
with two 1505 scsi cards.
Before this patch (now in 2.3.23) aha152x was usable only
as module.
I've also noticed that difference from 2.2.x version are
minimal and maybe is better to have only one 152x source
for 2.2 and 2.3 kernel.
I think there is no problem to fix this "unresolved symbol"
but as you can see I've CC all aha152x related mails also to
the MAINTAINER Juergen Fisher that never reply.
thanks,
luca
