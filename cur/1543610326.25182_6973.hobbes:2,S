cristian: same problem here. posted some time ago on linux-kernel and
some days ago on linux-scsi. no solution so far...
my config, in a very few words:
- tyan SMP motherboard + 2xAthlon
- adaptec aic7xxx (2 onboard 1 PCI - tried with all of them, same
  result)
- IBM HDD - mines are the 36 GB model - 
http://www.storage.ibm.com/hdd/ultra/ul36lzx.htm
 
it seems yours are the 18 GB model - 
http://www.storage.ibm.com/hdd/ultra/ul18es.htm
  
(more details in the postings on linux-kernel, linux-scsi)
is adaptec+ibm a "dangerous" combination??
what is strange is that the "freezing" behaviour appears randomly, even
though it seems to be connected to "heavy" accesses to the HDD.
please let me know if you have found a solution for this problem,
thanks!
bye now!
