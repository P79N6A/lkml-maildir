Nothing protects. On UP system it is impossible, if open is correctly
written and does not sleep before incrementing count. On SMP - oops.

It will not help. After MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT dropped use count to zero,
module can be unloaded while pc on one cpu is still inside it.
The answer is: modules cannot be unloaded on an SMP system at all,
if you do not want to crash.
