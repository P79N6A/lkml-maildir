Because of this possible event sequence: user space -> kernel -> SAL ->
PAL -> physical mode -> MCA/INIT.  When MCA/INIT is delivered in
physical mode, the contents of all registers are undefined.  PAL can
use r13 for its own work, as long as r13 is restored before returning
to the kernel.  MCA/INIT breaks the assumption that r13 is always valid.
