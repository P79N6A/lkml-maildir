I'm using the ZT bios with ABIT KT7A and I have not encountered any OOPSes or
anything with Athlon/Duron optimized kernels. I've been using the -ac kernels
since 2.4.0, upgrading regularly. I'm running a 1200 MHz TBird.  I'm reluctant
to try later BIOSes because #1: Mine works as it is now, and #2: I'm afraid of
'increased memory stability' changes that would decrease performance or raise
CPU temperature (as one BIOS changelog had mentioned).

The ZT bios has bit 7 of offset 0x55 set, too.
This is an unmodified 2.4.8-ac7.
