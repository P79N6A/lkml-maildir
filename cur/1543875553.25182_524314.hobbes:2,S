Variables to take into account:
* the drive (NCQ performance wildly varies)
* the IO scheduler
* the filesystem (if not measuring direct to blkdev)
* application workload (or in your case, benchmark tool)
	* in particular, the threaded-ness of the apps
For the overwhelming majority of combinations, NCQ should not /hurt/ 
performance.
For the majority of combinations, NCQ helps (though it may not be often 
that you use more than 4-8 tags).
In some cases, NCQ firmware may be broken.  There is a Maxtor firmware 
id, and some Hitachi ids that people are leaning towards recommending be 
added to the libata 'horkage' list.
