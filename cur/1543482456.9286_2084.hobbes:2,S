OK, well while I was getting together all the details to post a bug
report I discovered that the DMA setting in /etc/conf.modules was wrong.
How embarassing...  I don't know why it used to work, but I'm not

Note that mine is the ESS688, good old-fashioned jumper settings, not
1688, so your problem is probably entirely different.
