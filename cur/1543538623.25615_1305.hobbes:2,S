Hi Andries,
Have you followed the "GLOBS" model to reduce the addressing size issue?
If I understand this, there will be logical sectors of '512-byte' that
will define a GLOB == N*(512-byte) as the physical sector.  I think this
is best described as a 'multiwrite wrapper'.  There are sector and
subsector mapping......
It burns a few brain cells to follow this concept but it has a derivative
in AV-Streams.
Cheers,
