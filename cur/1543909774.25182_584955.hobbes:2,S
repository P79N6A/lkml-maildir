Only if min_free_kbytes is really the mininum number of free pages and not 
the mininum number of clean pages as I suggested.
All deadlocks? There are numerous ones that can come about for different 
reasons. Which ones are we talking about?

Right.

In the general case this is true even for an MPI job because the MPI job 
needs to have executable code and libraries in memory. At mininum these 
are reclaimable.

It is workable. If you crank the min_clean_pages (this is essentially 
what it is) up to 20% then you basically reserve 20% of your memory for 
executable pages and page cache pages. And in an emergency these can be 
reclaimed to resolve any OOM issues. Note that my patch only accesses 
these reserves when we would otherwise OOM. This is rare.

But that is an issue that is better handled in the network stack.
