The rationale behind giving high priority processes a large timeslice is
two-fold:
(1) if they are interactive, then they won't actually use it all (this
is the point you are making). But,
(2) Having a large timeslice ensures that they have a high probability
of having available timeslice when they _do_ need it.
So, yes, interactive processes can get by with a small timeslice,
because that is by-definition all they need.  But they do need to run
often (i.e., as I think you have mentioned in your last email,
interactive processes are "run often for short periods"), so the large
timeslice ensures that they are never expired.
A counterargument might be that the large timeslice is a detriment to
other high priority processes.  But the thinking is that, by definition,
interactive processes won't use all of the timeslice.  And thus will not
hog the CPU.  If they do, the interactivity estimator will quickly bring
them down.
That is the rationale in the current scheduler, anyhow.  Nick's current
work is interesting, and a bit different.

I don't think this is a good idea.  I see your intention, but we have
priorities for a reason.
