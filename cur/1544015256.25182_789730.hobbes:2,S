Here's how we can solve the double setkey problem.  We can make
a new cryptd_alloc_ablkcipher interface that returns a cryptd
ablkcipher object.  Since it's cryptd specific we can then access
its underlying blkcipher object, which can be shared between the
cryptd object and the user of the cryptd object.  This way you
only need to do setkey on the cryptd object and it'll get set
on the underlying blkcipher automatically.
Cheers,
