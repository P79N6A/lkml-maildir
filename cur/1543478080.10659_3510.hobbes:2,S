Been using pre-7 then pre-8 for several days now.
From where I sit, with almost all swap used and under sporadicly heavy
paging activity, pre-7 and pre-8 both seem to have a quite noticeably
better interactive keyboard response.
Since this is such a qualitative report, and especially on operating on 
the margin, it can be highly variable; I can't really distinguish between
pre-7 and pre-8 on the basis of feel.  But both seem like a substantial
improvement over pre-6 (which worked better for me than previous
versions).
