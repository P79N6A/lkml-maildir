Hi Michael,
I initiated this discussion in The Linux Foundation Summit@Google Campus
last week from the viewpoint of requirements by Japanese vendors/users.
As for a file to store message descriptions, I perfectly agree with your
analysis and we also noticed some (+) and (-) you pointed out in the
meeting last week. Our conclusion was to have a file outside of the
kernel source codes to lessen developers burdens and to encourage better
documentations of descriptions (as Andrew mentioned in his initial message).
