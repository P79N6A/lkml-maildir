wow, it seems to have taken 24 megabytes.
You may get nicer performance out of that little machine by decreasing
/proc/sys/vm/swappiness.  I have the feeling that the current default of
60% is about right for 256M machines, but too small for larger machines,
too large for smaller machines.   I use 85% on a 1G desktop machine.
