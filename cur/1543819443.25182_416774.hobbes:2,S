Subject: [PATCH] PCI quirk: VIA IRQ fixup should only run for VIA southbridges
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Alan Cox pointed out that the VIA 'IRQ fixup' was erroneously running
on my system which has no VIA southbridge (but I do have a VIA IEEE
1394 device).
This should address that.  I also changed "Via IRQ" to "VIA IRQ"
(initially I read Via as a capitalized via (by way/means of).
