Hi,
Attached file is the Super Page patch for 2.4.18.
It activates the super page feature of Alpha processor.
(It was known as the page granularity hint support patch, but
the super page is lucid for the people. I added TLB flush to the
two years old patch to avoid the Alpha architectual problem.)
When activated, the kernel will run upto 5 times faster
on a large matrix transpose benchmark.(it also attached for convinient)
I am testing with randomly malloc/free test program for a whole day,
and it seems quite stable. But I don't have any SMP machine,
then I have not tested on SMP.
I also have the IA32 port, and I will merge it when it seems to be stable enough.
I am not in the kernel list, then please cc to me for any comment to this mail.
Regards,
