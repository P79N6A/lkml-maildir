Yeah, neither form is bullet proof, even the original one will break down
when io_event size is not in power of 2.  The good news is that no where
near in sight that these two data structures size will change.
To make it a real bullet proof, it should be something like the following:
#define AIO_EVENTS_OFFSET       ((sizeof(struct aio_ring) +             \
                                  sizeof(struct io_event) - 1 ) /       \
                                  sizeof(struct io_event))
