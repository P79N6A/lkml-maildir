Yep. Debian-unstable has procps-3.1.5 now, which won't emit
this message with 2.4.xx and 2.5.xx kernels. Your system is
still inconsistant though, so rebooting would be a good idea.
(processes may appear to have been started in the future and
run for negative time)
The recent 2.5.xx kernels should be able to handle huge
uptimes better; you'll need the procps-3.1.6 release for
the most recent 2.5.xx kernels though.
