Hmm, so I didn't see this in the logs (a result of the above):
rpc.mountd[752]: segfault at 000000004b87ad6e rip 00000000080503e9 rsp 00000000ffffd684 error 4
nfsd: last server has exited
nfsd: unexporting all filesystems
rpc.mountd[3959]: segfault at 000000004b87ad6e rip 00000000080503e9 rsp 00000000ffffd494 error 4
nfsd: last server has exited
nfsd: unexporting all filesystems
rpc.mountd[3996]: segfault at 000000004b87ad6e rip 00000000080503e9 rsp 00000000ffffd494 error 4
nfsd: last server has exited
nfsd: unexporting all filesystems
rpciod: active tasks at shutdown?!
RPC: error 5 connecting to server localhost
RPC: failed to contact portmap (errno -5).
Is this a bug in mountd, then?  If so, sorry for the noise.
