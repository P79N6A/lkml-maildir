Often nowadays they'll not have 'kernel-headers' but instead 
'glibc-kernheaders' which is littered with '#ifdef __KERNEL__ #error' to 
prevent people from doing that.
If you don't have the corresponding source and configuration, you cannot
build a module with any reasonable chance of success -- at least for my
definition of 'reasonable' in the context of shipping drivers to the Great
Unwashed.

Build for Alpha and tell me that again :)
