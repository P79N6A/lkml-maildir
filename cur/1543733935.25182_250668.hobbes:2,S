Well, basically we have the same resolution as we do today. Right now
you specify the time in jiffies which has different resolutions
depending on configuration, so I'm not sure I see the problem. I mean, I
guess someone could be off put when they ask for a 1 ns expiration time
and it returns in 1 ms, but I thought timers followed sleep() semantics,
so it shouldn't be that much of an issue.

Even in this case, inaccurate hardware timers can only cause a single
tick jitter. The current problem we're seeing is that the timer
inaccuracy accumulates, so if we're 1% off, a sleep(600) returns 6
seconds late. Using the time source instead of jiffies for expiration
would avoid the accumulation, so we'd be at most a single tick late. 
Or is the problem more subtle?
