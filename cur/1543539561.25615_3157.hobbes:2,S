Can someone point be to some documentation on the asm capabilities in
gcc.  In particular I find this in asm/hw_irq.h:
#define BUILD_COMMON_IRQ() \
asmlinkage void call_do_IRQ(void); \
__asm__( \
	"\n" __ALIGN_STR"\n" \
	"common_interrupt:\n\t" \
	SAVE_ALL \
	"pushl $ret_from_intr\n\t" \
	SYMBOL_NAME_STR(call_do_IRQ)":\n\t" \
	"jmp "SYMBOL_NAME_STR(do_IRQ));
The first line looks like a function proto type.  It is unclear how it
is related to the rest of the macro.  This macro generates a bit of code
that is not a function in any way.  It has an entry label
"common_interrupt" and ends with a jmp.  What I really want to know is
how to refer to a C variable inside of such a construct.  The gcc
documentation talks about how to do it in more standard asm.  I would
like, for example to add to the above macro, for example:
    "incl foo.bar"            where bar is a member of structure foo.
I know this could be done as:  "incl foo+xxx"  where xxx is the offset
of bar in foo, but I would like the compiler to figure this for me so as
to follow structure changes.

P.S. I know why this code is the way it is.  What I am trying to
understand is how to add references to C data structures, not to
understand the what or why of this particular code fragment.
