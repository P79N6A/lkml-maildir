Every time this is brought up in comp.arch, it is widely shot down by
people who seem to know a lot about this kind of thing.  The points
they generally make are:
* Faults in chips generally involve things like shorts from power to
  ground, or miss-alignment over large areas.  These kind of problems
  will cause the entire chip to be unreliable, especially over the
  long term life of the chip.  It just isn't worth your reputation to
  release chips that fail after a few months/years.
* Without doing some major redesigning of the chips, it isn't easy
  (read cheap) to disable a portion of a chip after it is has been
  made and completely tested.  So, shipping working 486DX's as 486SX's 
  isn't profitable, and if you are going to redesign the chip, why not 
  redesign it with out the FPU?
* Major cost savings can be had by reducing the chip size, which
  removing the FPU would do.  Major cost savings can also be had by
  reducing the amount of time it takes to test a chip to make sure it
  completely works.  Removing the FPU does this also.
There may have been a few 486SX's that were carefully modified 486DX's
for prototype purposes, but it is unlikely that any of them made it out
Intel, and if they did, they went to a very small set of key vendors.
Hardware is different than software.  It is often very easy to disable 
large portions of your software and ship of nearly identical bits to
customers for radically different prices.  You can sometimes find
examples of this in hardware too, but probably not in things like
single chips like CPUs are.
