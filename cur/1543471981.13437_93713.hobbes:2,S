I got the following errors accessing my home directory over NFS from a
Solaris 2.5 NFS server.  The file in question (a shared library I wrote)
was rebuilt on another machine I think (a Linux 2.0.35 client to the same
server) so the status of the file (on the server) had changed out from
under the client (shouldn't be a problem).
The file was being accessed by the dynamic linker only, and NOT built on
the machine in question.
This is not the first report of this problem, see also:
