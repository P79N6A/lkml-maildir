I made changes other than just merging the three together (the
syspend/resume change and the bitfield parts in leds.h) so putting you
as signed off by/authorship would not have been "correct" and I credited
you in the commit message instead. I wanted to get the missing patches
queued ASAP so I went with the way that does fit in the rules as you'd
not have been happy if a modified patch was attributed to you. I'll put
you as author and a signoff if you confirm thats acceptable.
Cheers,
Richard
