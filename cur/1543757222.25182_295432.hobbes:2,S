There have been a handful of reports - there's surely a race in there.
Unfortunately I've yet to see a report from which we can identify the
offending line in the very large journal_commit_transaction() function.
The best way to do that is to ensure that the kernel was built with
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO, note the offending EIP value, then do
# gdb vmlinux
(gdb) l *0xc0<whatever>
