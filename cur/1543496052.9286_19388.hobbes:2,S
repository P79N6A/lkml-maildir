You are completly right about this. This is a completly untested fix alone
against 2.2.9 (my buffer code fixed this too but only incidentally, and
that's why I didn't thought too much about your words above until now).

I wonder if this patch is helping us at all here?  As I haven't seen any
ext2 messages at all on any of the machines here, I can't compare, but
perhaps people experiencing the problems could add this to their list of
things to try as well. :)
