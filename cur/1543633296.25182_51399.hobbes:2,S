It could be used by out of kernel tree code. (Note I don't know any code 
that does...)

NTFS defines its own vmalloc_nofs (fs/ntfs/malloc.h) so if you intend to 
add a generic vmalloc_nofs, please remove the ntfs one (or ntfs will break)...
btw. the ntfs definition is:
static inline void *vmalloc_nofs(unsigned long size)
{
         if (likely(size >> PAGE_SHIFT < num_physpages)
                 return __vmalloc(size, GFP_NOFS | __GFP_HIGHMEM, PAGE_KERNEL);
         return NULL;
}
Best regards,
         Anton
