Yes, re-reading the parent post it seems that's what required for ACPI.
Doing a pass with IRQ ON for regular devices, then IRQ OFF, then IRQ on
again for sysdevs and then again with IRQ off. Man, that's getting messy...
Well, I understand that ACPI is using semaphore and a GFP_KERNEL, but what
is the problem with MTRR? I understand that they should be set with IRQ
off but I highly doibt that enabling IRQ at the end is a requirement.
I think what is described in the commnet is rather a "normal flow of events".
