Correct, yes. Peter's procedure should work with the current
implementation, but it's safer to use the documented approach,
particularly if the solution is distributed to other people.
I currently don't have any plans for changing the pivot_root
implementation, but I wouldn't be surprised if something comes
up at some point in 2.5, since the overall boot architecture
needs a bit of work.
