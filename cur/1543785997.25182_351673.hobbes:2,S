Dear sir,
I have the same question recently & found a solution on the following url.
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0508.3/0397.html
& trace to this mailing list.
I had added a 255.255.255.255 route to a specific interface(eth0).
But seems no luck.
The broadcast package still go out via default gateway(eth1).
(detail "route -n" will be attached on the tail of this mail.)
Does anyone have any idea about it?
Should I enable something on my kernel?
ThanX in advance.
