Pardon me because I haven't made it all the way through this discussion 
yet, so I don't know if this has been suggested or dismissed. But I'm 
curious - rather than 'stealth upgrade' by way of mount options, why not 
just enable the functionality either via tune2fs or mkfs.ext3?
New distribution versions could ship installers that enable it, because users 
aren't really going to switch from a new distribution they just install to 
an older version (same story on the kernel).
Users that want the functionality today can have it by asking for it with 
tune2fs, they just have to bypass the warning that tells them they're not 
going to be able to boot kernels before 2.6.xx
