Andi, Jon, Muli,
I'm trying to build with the latest IOMMU patches for x86_64, so, I've
pulled down 2.6.17, and the 2.6.18-rc3 patches... But, that's obviously
lagging behind a bit.
Is there a source tree that you guys work from?
(I'm hoping that there's a better mechanism than keeping track of
patches as they are submitted here).
Leo Duran.

Agreed wrt the fs_enet and fec_8xx; the swiotlb stuff I dimly recall I
had a reason for. I'll take a look in bit to verify akpm's fix works.
