Take this with a grain of salt. It's true that it hasn't passed DVT. But it's
also true that f/w which *has* passed DVT has eaten your data as well.
Almost precisely by definition, if the system you embed this firmware in is
*not* one that has gone thru Qlogic DVT, you should in fact be putting the
warning on yourself.

It's not just a question of having firmware updated into flash- which, btw,
companies like Veritas have shied away from getting custoemrs to do because
you *do* have a small but finite amount of risk updating flash. It's also code
that as yet has to be written for qlogicfc (e.g.) that would pull it *out* of
flash so it can be pushed into SRAM (which is what the BIOS code on other
platforms do).
