Thanks, but I'm not looking for a working unionfs, rather for design
ideas for doing these sort of 'layered' filesystems _properly_, not
with hacks like system call table modification (like the above
solution).
Al, can you please give some guidance?  Have you any code for a
unionfs design, or only ideas, or was this just myth?
