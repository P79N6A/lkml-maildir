hm, i dont really like this solution - it just works around the problem by 
'speeding up' the system. If we have a _real_ slow system, there's no such 
way for us to speed it up.
Thomas, what do you think - would you expect this lockup to happen on 
really slow systems? If yes, is there a way we could avoid it from 
happening - by driving some sort of 'mandatory interval', that is doubled 
in size every time we detect such a bad hrtimer loop?
