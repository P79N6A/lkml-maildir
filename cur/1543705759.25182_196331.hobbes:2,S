Still doesn't boot on my nForce 2 system, hangs while probing PDC RAID card. 
Confirmed from 2.6.2-rc3-mm1 that it was likely related to ACPI changes, but 
reverting bk-acpi.patch makes no difference.
I'd like to test mainline, but I'm using gcc 3.4 snapshot, so I'll try later 
today with 2.6.2 + linus.patch.
