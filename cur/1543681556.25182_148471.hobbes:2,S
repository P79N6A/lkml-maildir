It looks like sysfs is creating a dir in class/tty by the name of
usb/acm/0 for my acm modem:
:; ls -AF /sys/class/tty
total 0
   0 console/
   0 ptmx/
   0 tty/
   0 tty0/
[ tty1 to tty63 elided ]
   0 ttyS0/
   0 ttyS1/
   0 ttyS2/
   0 ttyS3/
   0 usb/acm/0/
A [TAB] in bash will autocomplete /sys/class/tty/usb/acm/0.
W/ devfs the modem is at /dev/usb/acm/0, so it may be a sysfs
vs. devfs conflict.  (Box is gentoo; devfs is required for the 
init scripts to work.)
I think I'm at bk current, but may be off by a couple of csets.
