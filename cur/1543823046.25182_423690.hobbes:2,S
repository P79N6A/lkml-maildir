There would be no difference if the priority boost is done lower. The if and 
else blocks both end up equating to the same amount of priority boost, with 
the former having a ceiling on it, so yes it is the intent. You'll see that 
the amount of sleep required to jump from lowest priority to MAX_SLEEP_AVG - 
DEF_TIMESLICE is INTERACTIVE_SLEEP.
