Hi,
I got the appended OOPS on my system (i486, 48MB, 170 MB Swap, Linux
2.2.0, glibc 2.0.111, gcc 2.7.2.3) while I've put just a bit stress on 
my system (running three make processes and XEmacs at the same time).
A few seconds after the OOPS the system rebooted :-(.  The only
patches applied to the kernel are the current ISDN CVS sources.
