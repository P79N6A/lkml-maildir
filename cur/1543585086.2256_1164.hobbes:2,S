I've been running this (or close: my version tries 8 frames, then jumps
immediately to 1, without trying 4 and 2 in between if the kmalloc
fails) since it was changed.  Without such a patch, my CDDA read speed
drops to 25% the original rate.  You also have the fix that started the
thread!
Jens (cdrom maintainer) said he was working on a more elegant solution,
but to me, such a simple fix as yours should go in the kernel in the
meantime.  Jens?
