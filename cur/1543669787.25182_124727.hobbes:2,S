Interesting idea. AFAICS, this involves either changing the code of /sbin/init 
to set its affinity to a default cpu mask (provided by a kernel boot flag, I 
presume), or using taskset-like functionality and then hoping that all current 
shells etc. die before the programs I care about start.
Would it not be better to simply have the kernel use the boot flag directly as 
the default CPU mask setting?
[ I can see the argument that "if you need such control, you should set up your 
distro to deal with it", but that is a level of tweaking I would like to avoid 
for my customers ]
Thanks, Shaheed
