"idx" field is a group number userspace binds to, "val" is a private
identificator which is used as you like.

If cn_netlink_send() returns zero this means message was queued into
userspace socket. In case of error negative value is returned.

connector uses netlink_has_listeners(), but it can produce false
positives, in this case netlink_broadcast() will say the final word.
If message has been added into socket's queue netlink_broadcast(), which
is used in connector, returns zero, and it's return value is propagated
back to original caller of cn_netlink_send().
Message from userspace is always delivered, and in this case appropriate
callback is called.
