Hi!
I'm working on suspend-to-disk [mis]feature for linux. Before I
suspend machine, I need to stop all processes (to make sure they are
not holding any locks). I renamed SIGUNUSED for purpose. I just wonder
if SIGUNUSED is really unused these days...

PS: I really can not use SIGSTOP be cause
	1) I do not want parents to be notified
	2) I must distinguish between 'stopped' and 'stopped because
of suspend' process - I only want to wake up the later after resume
:-).
PPS: I have first version of suspend-er, that is design-bug-free!
