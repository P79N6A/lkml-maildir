That certainly is incomplete, at least the insmod messages should be
there if mencoder triggeres the crash.  A serial console log would be
helpful.  You can also try to reverse only parts of the patch, only the
changes in bttv-driver.c and/or in bttv-risc.c and see what happens.
Which format+size you are capturing with mencoder?
