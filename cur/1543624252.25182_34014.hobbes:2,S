I ended up deleting the name of the person who asked...
/dev/cua0....4 devices have been obsolete for some time.
One is supposed to open a serial device as:
    if((fd = open(modem, O_RDWR|O_NDELAY, 0)) == FAIL)
        ERRORS;
    if((flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL, 0)) == FAIL)
        ERRORS;
    flags &= ~O_NDELAY;
    if(fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags) == FAIL)
        ERRORS;
This allows one to set whatever terminal parameters are necessary
for the modem line, typically "raw", no interpretation, no
echo, and hardware flow-control.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
