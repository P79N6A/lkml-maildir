hp->hotplug_offset was used to allow pdc_host_init() to work for both
1st and 2nd generation chips. However, more tests were needed to
properly handle other aspects of 2nd generation chips, so hp->flags
and PDC_FLAG_GEN_II were introduced. Now hp->hotplug_offset is redundant
since its value is derivable from hp->flags & PDC_FLAG_GEN_II.

OK, I'll replace the ?: with an if-statement.
