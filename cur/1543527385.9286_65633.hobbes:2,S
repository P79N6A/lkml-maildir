Nope.  Well, not entirely.  That is a serious enough problem, but easily
fixed without much dispute.  My sticking point is in making the kernel do what
should be done in user space.  Text->Binary->process->Text is just a really
bad thing in my book.

There is a BIG difference between the kernel returning a u32 to userspace
as the four bytes that make up the u32 (which can be done in ~1 insn) and
converting that u32 to a text format ("%08x") (which takes many more than
~1 insn.)  Add to that the processing the userspace application is going to
perform to turn that text back into a u32 to perform real work on it.
Multiply all that by the number of times that happens over the course of
a day and it'll add up to a whole lot of cpu time that could have been
better spent doing "real work."

Gee, millions of computers all over the world waste, say, 35% of their
processing capability constantly translating from text to binary and vice
versa because YOU want to read procfs files directly.  How rude of me to
suggest otherwise. <smirk>
Let me point out the loop-hole here... YOU are already running a command
to process the procfs data -- 'cat' or something similar.  The fact that
you use the same command to read any file is only slightly important.  The
fact that the command is merely moving procfs data from one fd to another
is not important -- altho' the obvious optimization would be to create a
path for instructing the kernel (ala procfs) to dump the procfs data directly
to the destination fd, but that's an NT-ism :-)  The fact that the kernel
is performing the textual generation and formating IS important.
By placing the human interfacing in the kernel, you are making the assumption
that humans will be the _only_ thing interested in the output.  If this were
true, then a large number of applications could be removed from distributions
as redundant and replaced by 'cat'.  If there is a single instance where a
non-human application acts on, or otherwise processes the information made
available from the kernel via procfs other than simple reformating (moving
whitespace, translocating columns, etc.) then this assumption is no longer
valid.

Then you would present no obstacles to a procfs for process data and a
kernfs for kernel information?

I'm sorry for the confusion... "thing" is in user space.  A buffer overflow
in user space can (read: always ends up) resulting in something or someone
attaining root privs.  At which point, any file system permissions that
may exist no longer have any bearing.  This is a moot point anyway as you'd
have access to the same information via procfs or sysctl() -- plus, with
root access, you can mount procfs where you can see it :-(
(Yes, you can mount '/proc' more than once.)

I'll try...
Let's say you are going to be running a program that cannot be trusted with
access to the entire system.  (Maybe I should say _won't_ be trusted.)  SO,
it's started from a chroot()ed environment.  This environment will obviously
NOT have any part of procfs anywhere near it.  When this program starts,
it tries to find out how many processors there are in this machine to know
how many threads to create.  Under Linux, that's not possible without access
to procfs.  The program gives up and assumes at least one processor.  It then
tries to find an open port in a specific range.  It cannot use any type of
"netstat" logic as that information is in procfs (net/tcp) so the apps only
choice is to start trying each port in sequence.
Short of mounting procfs inside the program's environment, there are alot
of things it cannot figure out without a lot of work (i.e. bruteforce
detection.)  That includes some of the sysconf() information.
Is that good enough?

Umm, there's no need to do any of that... the kernel knows EXACTLY how many
processors there are -- that number doesn't change in a running system.
There's just no way to get at that number without counting cpuinfo stuff
or rooting through /dev/kmem.  (I'm going to continue to bitch about this
until it's fixed.)

Actually, panzer tanks corner pretty well from what I've seen :-)  But that's
not important...
The point is, if I want to be able to run 'ps', then I get all this other
junk riding along with it.  I can cut some of it out by disabling sysctl,
but that doesn't do much.  Additionally, if I want to be able to administer
syncookies or the like, I need procfs enabled...
I'm not saying do away with procfs -- that's just as bad as altering the
format of meminfo, for example.  I simply want a means to access and control
things via a programatic, non-human, binary interface.  There needs to be
ways of accessing things other than via text in /proc.  You can leave the
file system accessed textual crud if you like (and YOU do) but kindly
split that off of procfs so being able to see the process tree doesn't
drag along with it a bunch of other stuff you might not want.
Actually, spliting procfs into two parts isn't such a bad idea.  It would
be far less mess than converting everything (or anything for that matter)
to a binary format instead of the text format(s).  (I'll revisit this later.)

You can control when you get information via printk too, but who cares?

It doesn't have to be "weird ioctls and sysctls".  You can read binary data
from procfs just like you can from anywhere else.  The sysctl() stuff is
merely a suggestion to avoid forcing programs to parse text -- they can
use a sysctl (or read a binary file) to get something in a native format.

That may be, but I see way too much of it.  I don't know which is worse,
lex code (read: wu-ftpd) or sendmail rulesets.

Actually, that'd be scank() :-)  And it would of course panic() and/or oops
on error <grin>

There's a big difference between the printf() path to the screen and the
read() from procfs to the printf().  The printf() output is pure byte
copying -- there's no translations to anything from anything.  The read()
from procfs returns text which netstat then converts to binary before
printf()ing them to the screen.  One could optimize some of this but
parts of the information from procfs has to be converted to binary before
it can be processed -- ip address information for example.

My problem is with the str->bin->str.  Have you ever used babelfish?  I
rest my case.

You're already using a tool... it just so happens to be the same tool
in every case.
>The zillions of programs you want to interpose are unnecessary. By
Not at all.  These programs already exist.  When people want to see the
route table, do they 'cat /proc/net/rt_cache'?  No, they use 'route' or
'netstat -r'.  When people want to see the list of network connections,
do they 'cat /proc/net/tcp'?  No, they use 'netstat -t'.  When people want
to see memory utilization, do they 'cat /proc/meminfo'?  No, they run 'free'.
When people want to see the mounted file systems, do they 'cat /proc/mounts'?
No, the simply run 'mount'.
The information YOU so love to access via 'cat' the majority of people access
via the programs designed for the respective information.  In fact, alot of
them are using system management tools (linuxconf, etc.) and don't even
know about the procfs files.  We are not the average user -- I would venture
to say no one on l-k is.

To you, me, and the rest of the kernel toadies, maybe.  But to the rest of
the planet (you know, the people who cannot parse text or use a multi-button
mouse?), it's giberish.

This is merely a self-reinforcing paradox.  People write less and less
efficient (optimal) code because they know processors keep getting faster.
Likewise, processors keep getting faster because the code keeps getting
worse.  There's no motivation to generate good code anymore.

Umm, how is that any different from a binary data structure?  NONE.  If you
change the format, the previous parser breaks.  Experience has shown binary
structures are far less prone to tinkering.

You want a nuclear power facility unmaned?  You really are nuts.

Unfortunately, efficient doesn't always mean fast.  I know, the buz words
are hard to qualify with modern processors. (what's fast on one isn't
necessarily fast on another, etc.)
>doing something TWICE, rather tha SLOW? Bear in mind that doing it
On principle, yes, doing something slowly once is prefered to doing it
twice fast. (see below)

Yes, I know this too.  Modern processors have a great deal of magic in
them making "efficient" a pencil and paper principle.  (Damn that real
world!)

Ah, quantum computing... efficient and inefficient _at the same time_.

(of course it's speed also defies logic -- it pipelines very well it would

Yeh.  I'm the only one using them.  Take the change to meminfo some years
ago.  It was trivial to tool 'free' to deal with it, how you'd need to get
several million people to replace their 'free'.  Once a format is entrenched,
it's very difficult to change. (the format for /proc/net/dev changed awhile
back too, and it confused the hell out of people -- didn't crash anything
though.)

Ok, the counters are not displayed... and it fails to list aliases (at least

SOME X servers will fail to start as they look in /proc to detect the PCI

<grin> the kernel will not care nor should init.  So, the machine should

Ok.  I'll have to go look at the descriptor handling... if dup() goes
down the open() path, then no problem.  Otherwise, procfs might need to
check a use count before freeing the buffer. (or we can just leak memory :-))
