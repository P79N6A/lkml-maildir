Well, I certainly _can_ tell you that 2.3.8 was unbelievably faster than
2.2.10 in the benchmarks that I'm running.  It's not that I'm memory starved
(1 GB), just _really_ heavy on filesystem activity.  Although from what I see
so far (hoping 2.3.9final fixes this) we really hit a brick wall at a certain
point, and filesystem performance drops right back to where it was with
2.2.10, if not lower.  But that's way past a hundred users banging the heck
out of the filesystem, so I don't know how often that case is tested...
