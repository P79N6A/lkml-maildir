That would have been true >10 years ago, when Alan introduced it.
Nowadays, the BKL is just another type of lock, albeit with very unique
properties. The two main ones being:
        - it can be taken recursively.
        - you can call schedule() while holding it.
                Note however, that upon yielding, the process
                automatically gives up the lock, then retakes it when it
                is rescheduled

Sigh... Removing the BKL is not a trivial thing to do. You have make
absolutely sure that you understand the thread data dependencies that
are protected by that lock. That is why we do it gradually.
