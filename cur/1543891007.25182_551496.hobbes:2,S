A couple of things:
- use a switch statement in toshiba_deliver_button_event(), would look a
bit cleaner.
- make the magic number #defines
- not sure if it's possible, but you should disable the workqueue
altogether if nothing has the input device opened.
Hopefully we'll find a way to receive an interrupt, or some kind of
event when the keys are pressed in the future, and completely avoid the
polling. In the meantime, it should be minimised.
Cheers
