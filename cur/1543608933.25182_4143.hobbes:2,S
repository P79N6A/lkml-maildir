My kernel crashes when I try run a program in gdb. The error output is
below. I run kernel 2.4.13-ac5. Is attachments allowed to this list? I
could attach the binary.
The drive is a one year old IBM drive, and everything else is working
perfectly, eg. I have compiled and installed several programs without
trouble.
Please CC me any replies, because I'm not subscribed to the list.
