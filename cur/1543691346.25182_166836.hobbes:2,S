If you'll use __get_free_pages(0) 160 times, you should be able to use
vmap() in 2.[456].x.
I must say that I do not understand why it checks for 
size > (max_mapnr << PAGE_SHIFT) in 2.4.x, or for count > num_physpages
in 2.6.x (as there is nothing wrong with mapping same page several
thousand times, or is it bad? with 32MB host you have plenty of
unused VA space in the kernel...), but it should not hurt you as you
need distinct physical pages.
On other side, maybe that using SG even for driver operations is not
that complicated. Do not forget that on bigmem boxes you have only
128MB area for vmalloc/vmap/ioremap, so you can quickly find that
there is not 640KB continuous area available.
