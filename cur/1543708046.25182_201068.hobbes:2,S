Hey guys,
i have a problem using the docking station of my Thinkpad A31p.
If it is unplugged (with or without ac), USB is working fine, but if i 
plug the system into the docking station, USB doesn't work.
As i remember, it has worked until Kernel 2.6.2-rc3, maybe a ACPI 
problem? I am using an ACPI-DSDT from acpi.sf.net!
With Windoze USB is working fine!
Please help!
