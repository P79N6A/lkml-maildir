The proper time to walk the /proc filesystem and cache such info, is, of
course, in the ->sp_post_addmount() LSM hook.  Check @mnt and @mountpoint_nd to
see if it's /proc, and if so, go snarf all the info you need to make your tests
fast..
Not sure if you'd need to redo your cache in sp_post_remount(), for the odd case
where /proc gets remounted....
