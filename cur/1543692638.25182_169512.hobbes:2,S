Subject: [2.6.0-test6] Scratchy sound with via82xx (VT8233)

Starting with 2.6.0-test6 the sound is (often) not OK. For example,
I let KDE play a sound when email arrives. Often I only hear scratchy
noise, but sometimes sound is OK.
The lcpci output for this device is:
00:11.5 Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8233 AC97 Audio Controller (rev 10)
        Subsystem: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd.: Unknown device 3800
        Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 10
        I/O ports at d000 [size=256]
        Capabilities: [c0] Power Management version 2
I saw the note about dxs_support, but I have the driver built-in. How do I set
dxs_support from the /proc/cmdline?
