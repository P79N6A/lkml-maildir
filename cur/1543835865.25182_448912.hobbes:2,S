Subject: [PATCH 2/33] i386: define __pa_symbol
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

On x86_64 we have to be careful with calculating the physical
address of kernel symbols.  Both because of compiler odditities
and because the symbols live in a different range of the virtual
address space.
Having a defintition of __pa_symbol that works on both x86_64 and
i386 simplifies writing code that works for both x86_64 and
i386 that has these kinds of dependencies.
So this patch adds the trivial i386 __pa_symbol definition.
