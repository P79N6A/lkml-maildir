I would like to note an objection to using ifconfig to carry all of this.
For example I do not use or even have ifconfig on any of my systems as I
only use/need/want Alexey's ip utility to perform all of those tasks. 
I would rather have an independant utility that could set and check the
settings of all of these variables for whatever classes of networking
connections existed. This would provide a cleaner split between the
protocol configuration (IPv4, IPv6, IPX, ...) and the device (V.##,
10/100, 4/16/100, etc) parameters. 
Such a split should make for a cleaner configuration structure WRT virtual
devices as well which for the most part deal with the protocol config and
do not need much device config. 
FWIW: Alexey's ip has replaced both ifconfig and route on my systems.
Something that could now replace having several different card config
utils around with one binary would be fantastic.

Thanks! I will volunteer to test/break/etc as my coding skills verge
beyond ludicrous.
