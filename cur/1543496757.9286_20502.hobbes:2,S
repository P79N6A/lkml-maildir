Sorry, I've been doing SMP for about 12 years, and it isn't this simple.
Grabs "one of the trees".  What happens if they are sharing open files or
two processors try to share the tree?  Linux doesn't have decent shared sync
objects, how do they implement r/w locks, do they provide them in the file
system, or does Irix have its own unique ones?  The log file (journal is
SINGLE threaded [it has to be on a journalling file system]).  There's a lot
of issues with mapping a **REAL** SMP file system to Linux.  Linux needs a
lot of SMP work to support these types of technologies with some decent
scaling and an expanded set of sync primitive.   I've got $100.00 that says
it will be **SLOWER** than ext2, and the scaling will be dismal.  Care to
take the bet?

Let's see if their lawyers are really going to let them give away their IP
with no strings attached.  This will be interesting.
