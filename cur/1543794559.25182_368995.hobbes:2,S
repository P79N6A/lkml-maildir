Hi,
 Is the character device HbaApiNode missing in
2.6.9-22.ELsmp ?
 Any way to get this ioctl with command
EXT_CC_GET_DATA working in absence of that or is there
any other way to get the Controller Error Count and 
Link Failures for monitoring the Fibre Channel ?
 Please suggest.
  Br, 
    Dipankar.
