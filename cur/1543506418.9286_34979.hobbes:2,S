Interesting. Now, you can either try linux-input patches from
vojtech@ucw.cz (and hope he got it right), or you can debug it yourself:
Aha. Let's talk about 2.3.X. You need to check detect_auxiliary_port
routine. Did it say "Detected PS/2 Mouse Port at startup"? If not,
just force detect_aux...() to return 1 and complain loudly that
detect_aux...() does not work.
