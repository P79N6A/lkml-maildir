About system call latency ... anyone tried the Linux Trace Toolkit?
This will give you exactly how much time is spent in any system
call and what the kernel does during that system call. Total system
overhead is below 1.5% for non-fs intensive systems. This effectively
closes the gprof loop-hoole and reports micro-second accurate system
call / trap / irq information and much more ... Take a look for yourself
