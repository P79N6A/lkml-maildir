Good catch!
I've fixed this slightly differently.  Also, the kmalloc size
in the case where it does straddle a page isn't enough either.
[CRYPTO] blkcipher: Fix handling of kmalloc page straddling
The function blkcipher_get_spot tries to return a buffer of
the specified length that does not straddle a page.  It has
an off-by-one bug so it may advance a page unnecessarily.
What's worse, one of its callers doesn't provide a buffer
that's sufficiently long for this operation.
This patch fixes both problems.  Thanks to Bob Gilligan for
diagnosing this problem and providing a fix.
