Hmm, strange. Actually 7c64ade53a6f977d73f16243865c42ceae999aea fixed
a similiar bug, see here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11908
Your patch with 2.6.28, does:
 grep NMI /proc/interrupts
returns exactly 1 NMI per core or some more?

External and static variables should be gaaranteed to be initialized
