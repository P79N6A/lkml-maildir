This is somewhat difficult as this patch touches files that are the
responsibility of three different maintainers.  Is it possible to
split the patch into three, one for each maintainer (possibly by
keeping both old and new interfaces around for a little while)?
If not, then you need to get an Acked-by and an agreement that this
change can go via the powerpc.git tree from Roland Dreier and Jeff
Garzik.
Paul.
