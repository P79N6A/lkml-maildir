It's been broken a long time, I'm running 2.2.12 on a box with 4 tulip
cards. three DC21041 and on DS21140
If I position the cards in the box I get
slot-1 DS21140 eth0 pcidevice-8
slot-2 DC21140 eth1 pcidevice-9
slot-3 DC21140 eth2 pcidevice-10
slot-4 DC21140 eth3 pcidevice-11
I move the DS21140 to slot 2 I get
slot-1 DC21140 eth0 pcidevice-8
slot-2 DS21140 eth3 pcidevice-11
slot-3 DC21140 eth1 pcidevice-9
slot-4 DC21140 eth2 pcidevice-10
I would assume that pci-devices are allocated oddly, first nic gets first
pci-device, then the bus is scanned for same type of devices and they get
next pci-devices, etc...
As the the nicnames are allocated against the pci-devicelist, which is
allready wrong, the names are wrong also.
