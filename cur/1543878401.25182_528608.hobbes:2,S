Something is odd, very odd indeed. But surprise-surprise, it does not
seem to be something merely SD-releated.
In short, the question is - can we always believe statistics being
provided by "top" (i.e. the way it's being collected by the kernel)?
The tests are below. Somewhere in the middle are thoughts on how HZ
and an interval of cpu usage by a given task may be connected to such
a behaviour.
The system: Pentiium 3 Coppermine 750 MHz (iThinkPad T21), 256 RAM.
I tested 3 configurations:
(1)  2.6.13-15 (default in SuSE 10)
(2)  2.6.19
(3)  2.6.21-rc5 + sd-0.39
TEST: just a tenp.c, i.e. without Mike's "steal" (either as xx.c or as
a part of modified fairtest.c) thingy, but
tenp    -- a tenp.c with a single running copy;
tenp2  -- a tenp.c with 2 (1 additionally forked) running copies
tenp15 - 15 copies (only for SD)

I repeated 7 times each of the tests (tenp and tenp2). All are ok.
Now an interesting part starts.

See a difference between [ 2.1 ] and [ 2.2 ] ?  [ 2.2 ] (which is ok)
has happened 3 out of 10 times.
Now for tenp2

Again, [ 2.3 ] took place only 3 times.
Some observations:
/1/  for the "ok" ( [ 2.2 ] and [ 2.3 ] ) cases, the "will run" and
"will sleep" times from tenp's calibration output look /higher/ than
on average :
e.g.
Each fork will run for 5863 usecs and sleep for 52767 usecs
v.s. something in between
Each fork will run for 2392 usecs and sleep for 21528 usecs
Each fork will run for 3880 usecs and sleep for 34920 usecs
for the most part of cases (when tenp's cpu% ~0.3).
/2/  HZ = 250 for 2.6.19 and I think it was still 1000 for 2.6.13
(arghh.. forgot to check and would like to avoid a reboot in this
already late hour... but I believe it was still the time of 1000 by
default).
=============
(*)
HZ == 250 ==> timer_tick is once in 4 ms. So - "will run for" < 4 ms -
may come well unaccounted? :o)
The funny thing is (at least in theory) - if a task is using CPU in
portions < 1/HZ s. and specially shifted against timer interrupts ->
scheduler_tick() - its time_slice isn't decreasing at all (very
theoretically) or just more or less slower (with another load a moment
when the task is running should drift wrt moments of timer interrupts
and hit them from time to time -> get accounted).
=============
(3)  2.6.21-rc5 + sd-0.39
Here the results are similar to (2).

strange.
I doesn't happen for tenp15 (each always consumes ~6%). I repeated
about 10 times.
Well, it's a late hour, so maybe I'm missing something... but it does
look to be HZ and "will run" time interval related issue. Like
described in (*). Or maybe we both observe similar situations but have
different reasons behind them.
