I took a quick look through, and am quite impressed.  I have not yet
had a chance to go through it carefully (much less read the read of
the thread), but wanted to say "thank you!!!" for doing the measurements.
I am sure that there will be some, umm, "controversy" over the benchmark
and measurement methodology, but getting some agreement on what to
measure and how to measure it will be very valuable.
My guess is that there will end up being more than one benchmark, given
the large variety of RT apps out there, but who knows?
						Thanx, Paul
