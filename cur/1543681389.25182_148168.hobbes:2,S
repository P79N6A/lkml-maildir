This is getting silly.  The timer stuff has been an ongoing bug factory and
now it is colluding with the do_div() saga.
Can we just get the things working, without mangling every architecture
again?

AFAICT, we can just rework posix-timers.c to use the standard do_div() and
be done with it, can we not?  ie: no div_long_long_rem(), no
div_ll_X_l_rem().  Just do_div().
Please use `static inline', not `extern inline', btw.
