I'm re-building with HRT on now, but I just noticed another side effect of 
2.6.18.  I have an led sniffer plugged into the pl2302 usb<->serial 
adaptor laying where I can see it, and all leds are red, as if the 
interface has not been inited properly.  And I don't see it being 
initialized in the dmesg.  I thought the default was to build it.  Yup, 
pl2303.ko is present in the /lib/modules trees all across the board.
Any ideas on this one folks?
