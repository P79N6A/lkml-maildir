Hi Burton,

Mmm..
My hardware config consists in an Acer 272Xv with sis chipset 650 (I read it 
in 2.4.21 and previous dmesg).
I think that config file is OK because when 2.6 starts, I can see something 
about "SIS961 chipset MUTIOL", and in the .config file I've set 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SIS5513=y that I always used for previous kernels.
