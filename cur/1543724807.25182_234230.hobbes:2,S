I'd rather not change the config space again ... that's clearly wrong.
Or is there some policy about what sorts of BIOS bugs we should assume?
Instead, how about:  (a) longer timeout, 5 seconds to match OHCI's
absurdly long default there; (b) change that "handoff failed" message
to add "continuing anyway"; and (c) return 0 as you do, which I'm
expecting is the key part of that patch.
That'll evidently work for Will, as well as correctly functioning hardware
with EHCI-aware BIOS (the Dell boxes and the AMI BIOS box I tested) also
the classic EHCI-unaware BIOS setups.
