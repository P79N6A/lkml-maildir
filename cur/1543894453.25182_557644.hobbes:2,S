Thanks I went ahead and put a separate snapshot up on SourceForge:
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/xscaleiop/md-accel-2.6.22-rc4-20070614.patch
[ It's actually based on current git but should apply cleanly to 2.6.22-rc4. ]
If you are so inclined the most up-to-date version is available via git.
git pull git://lost.foo-projects.org/~dwillia2/git/iop md-accel-linus
It should perform identically to vanilla 2.6.22-rc4 MD.
