That just divides up the problem, but doesn't solve it.  The simplest would
be to print a badness and somehow get out of the flush.  Then anyone who is
triggering the corner case (us, in this case) can just solve it ourselves.
It's not pretty.
In short, it's dubious that ANYONE call flush_scheduled_work() on a
workqueue that they don't own.
