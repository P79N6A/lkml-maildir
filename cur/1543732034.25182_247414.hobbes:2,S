You are right about not allowing schedule from callbacks. The callbacks
are called from softirq context.
Without your current code, it is difficult to say how to do this but here are
some guesses - 
1. You could mark the freed up structure deleted on update, do
   put_namspace() and do only the freeing in the rcu callback.
   dentries do this.
2. If not performance critical, you could use a workqueue to
   do the actual freeing including put_namespace(). Just wake up
   from the rcu callback.
These may or may not be applicable to your case. More details will
help.
Thanks
