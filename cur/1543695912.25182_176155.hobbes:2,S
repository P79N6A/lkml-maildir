Well, major 13 is for all input devices not for mousedev alone. You have input 
built-in which means there is no reason for kernel to try autoload driver for 
char-13 as it is already available.
You may add explicit per-minor autoloading to input.c, see

no. Loading on demand simply is not supported.
If you are using hotplug, both should be loaded by hotplug. IMHO it is also 
the right way to go.

which is of course already available in hotplug, sorry for confusion.

char-major-13 is 'input'. Period. It is not mousedev or whatever. For this 
reason it must implement its own autoloading if desired. Cf. misc driver.
Hid will never be autoloaded (without manual configuration) on access to 
mousedev because they are independent. Mousedev provides use interface to any 
mouse, not just USB mouse handled by HID. Mousedev has no way to know what 
hardware is connected until driver for it has registered with input layer. So 
hid should be loaded when mouse is detected (i.e. by hotplug) or manually if 
you always know you have USB mouse. Building it in kernel is the easiest way 
to ensure it is always available.
