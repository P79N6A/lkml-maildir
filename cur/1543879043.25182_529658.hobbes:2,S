Sometimes, the best is to redo the undo of the dwarf based stack
unwinder.
But as you said, that _huge_ number of buffers might be the issue, I'm
looking through the codepaths from __blkdev_put on downwards, I suspect
we hold a single lock somewhere,...
So hold on with patching the unwinder back in (unless of course you
fancy doing so :-)
