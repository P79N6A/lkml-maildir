This patch looks rather tab damaged.
I think it's problematic in that it can hold the semaphore for an
unbounded amount of time.
I'd suggest dropping and acquiring the semaphore each time through the
loop, but then you get into a situation where a second process can
cause the returned results to no longer be coherent. Since we'd no
longer have a way to get single results, this'd be bad.
