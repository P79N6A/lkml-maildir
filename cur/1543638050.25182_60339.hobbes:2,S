Ugh. there's a few things you can do
 - I often actually do a "bk undo -axxx" and then just re-do the parts I 
   want to re-do.
   NOTE! This only works if you haven't already had people pull from your 
   repository (or you'll need to ask them to do the "bk undo" as well).
 - You can reverse the cset, which means that it's still there, but there 
   is also a cset that says "undo that other cset". I prefer to not pull 
   those kinds of undo's, but they do happen, and I occasionally do them
   myself. I try to avoid it, but it's very useful for debugging ("does 
   that problem go away if I undo just that one cset?"), and sometimes 
   it _is_ the sanest way to go.
   So do "bk cset -xA.BBB"
 - in this case, maybe just adding a new cset is the proper thing. 
   Especially as reversing the cset doesn't actually get you where you
   want anyway, since you'd still have to do the "unsigned short" -> "u16"  
   translation as yet another cset.
I only get upset if the tree looks _really_ cluttered, in which case I may 
ask you to re-do it (that's happened once with the reiserfs tree).
