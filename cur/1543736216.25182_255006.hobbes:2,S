We talked about this in Ottawa a few months ago, and I think this is the
right approach. Note though, that I think it needs to be more complete:
- There needs to be restore_state() to be symmetic.
- There needs to be the proper failure recovery
  If save_state() or suspend() fails, every device that has had their
  state saved needs to be restored.
- It needs to be called for all power management requests.
- The PCI implementation should call pci_save_state() in it, instead of in
  ->suspend().
It would be great if you could add these things. Otherwise, I'll add it to
my TODO list..
Thanks,
