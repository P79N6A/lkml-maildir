By the way, the DAC capable Symbios chips donnot support scatter entry
that crosses a 4GB boundary by *design*. In fact they seem to be
internally 32 bit addressing based with some additionnal logic for DAC to
be possible, but they don't look like true 64 bit engine.
And since these devices have had some ISA ancestors, they also have some
16 MB limit in some place. This applies to the max length that can be
DAMed by scatter entry. And since everything has bugs, some errata
applying to some early chip versions have some relationship with scatter
entry crossing a 16 MB or 32 MB boundary...
As a result, for Symbios devices, I want to ask upper layers not to
provide low-level drivers with scatter entries that cross a 16 MB boundary
and obviously not larger than 16 MB but it is a consequence. If Linux does
not allow this, they I can do nothing clean to fix the issue.
Btw, a 16 MB boundary limitation would have no significant impact on
performance and would have the goodness of avoiding some hardware bugs not
only on a few Symbios devices in my opinion. As we know, numerous modern
cores still have rests of the ISA epoch in their guts. So, in my opinion,
the 16 MB boundary limitation should be the default on systems where
reliability is the primary goal.

This shouldn't have been missed, in my opinion. :)
