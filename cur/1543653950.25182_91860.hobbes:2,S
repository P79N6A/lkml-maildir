Then it must be davem, Andi and I :) Stephen is just merging what we
already have.

_t32 == 32 bit version, its not the size. eg
asm-ia64/ia32.h:		typedef unsigned short	__kernel_ipc_pid_t32;
asm-mips64/posix_types.h:	typedef int		__kernel_ipc_pid_t32;
asm-parisc/posix_types.h:	typedef unsigned short	__kernel_ipc_pid_t32;
asm-ppc64/ppc32.h:		typedef unsigned short	__kernel_ipc_pid_t32;
asm-sparc64/posix_types.h:	typedef unsigned short	__kernel_ipc_pid_t32;
asm-x86_64/ia32.h:		typedef unsigned short	__kernel_ipc_pid_t32;
Or do you mean we should use typedef u16 __kernel_ipc_pid_t32? Yeah,
I can understand that.
