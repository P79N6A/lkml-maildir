Complete agreement, but it seems like there's a third option here.
We're talking about nothing more complicated than a table lookup here.
Having a `udevinfo` invocation would indeed be overkill (and slower
than just stating the entire /dev hierarchy, I'm sure), but
Greg's/Jon's point that udev is the original authoritative source of
the data remains.
A simple solution would be for udev to just maintain a list in a flat
file (e.g., /dev/.mappings) that could be read (very quickly) by ps
upon startup. This could be yet another strategy somewhere in your
list of heroic efforts to derive a /dev/ node :-).
Having anyone other than udev try to maintain that mappings cache file
is doomed to failure, as you already noted.
