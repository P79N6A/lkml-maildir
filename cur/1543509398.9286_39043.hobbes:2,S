I recommend that modules built into kernel use modname.parmname.  Use
the same syntax when loaded as a separate module but change insmod so
  insmod modname parm1=val1 parm2=val2
is tried "as is" first then retried as
  insmod modname modname.parm1=val1 modname.parm2=val2
if the parameter names do not exist in the module.  It would require
2.3.18-ac users to upgrade to a new modutils but that is nothing new.
Parameter files would be unchanged and both code and parm files would
be backwards compatible.
Shall I upgrade insmod to automatically insert a modname prefix on
parameters if the raw parameter name does not exist?
