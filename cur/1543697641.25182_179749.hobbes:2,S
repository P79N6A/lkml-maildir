Sorry, but unfortunately your guess is wrong (would have been too easy). A
few days ago i reported about the Tecra S1 problems on the acpi-devel list
as well, maybe you missed my post, which can be found in the archives here:
  
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=3511931&forum_id=6102
Included was a link to the disassembled dsdt, which can be found here:
  
http://www.kju.de/data/dsdt.dsl
As you can see, the _STA-Methods of both BAT0 and BAT1 do proper return
calls. I'm sorry, but i'm do not have any knowledge about acpi or dsdts to
debug this myself. The DSDT has some other errors as well.
It is somewhat strange, that toshiba as one of the core members of ACPI
seems to be unable to provide sane DSDTs for years now. Something is real
wrong with this company.
Regards
Michael
