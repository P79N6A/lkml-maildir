Umm, why do you need this at all?  The caller is either file IO --- in
which case you just do the map_user_kiobuf and pass that to the kiovec
IO routine --- or it is kernel-originated IO, in which case you create a
kiobuf of your own and just stuff it full of references to the kernel
pages you want to read or write.  
The low-level IO function should never, ever have to care about what
address space the kiobuf is coming from.  That's the whole point of
kiobufs.
