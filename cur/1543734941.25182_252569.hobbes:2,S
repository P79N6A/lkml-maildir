Typically, such a board would use a standard PCI interface chip
like those made by PLX. This would be connected to a FPGA plus
whatever else was needed to perform the needed functions.
If you attempt to make your own PCI interface using a FPGA,
you are going to devote a lot of time to that, alone. You
probably won't even get to your coprocessor until graduation.

The support is for whatever driver you provide. For instance,
the Analogic's Sky Computer Division produces array processors
with their own CPUs. The Sky-code runs in those processors.
It doesn't (can't) affect the Intel processor kernel code in
the host.

You could certainly make a Java engine run on your coprocessor
board or use Intel code, whatever is better at that instant.
This is done with a library that you provide.

Things that go on the PCI bus use drivers (modules) for interface.
The kernel doesn't directly determine what functions are handled
by kernel code and what ones are handled by your PCI interface
coprocessor. Your (or the standard) runtime libraries do this.
