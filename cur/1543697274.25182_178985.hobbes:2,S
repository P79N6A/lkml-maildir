Oops, two more major changes I forgot to mention:
	- udev.permissions can now handle wild cards.  So the following
	  line would apply for all ttyUSB devices:
	  	ttyUSB*:::0666
	- I've added two external programs to the udev tarball, under
	  the extras/ directory.  They are the scsi-id program from Pat
	  Mansfield, and the multipath program from Christophe Varoqui.
	  Both of them can work as CALLOUT programs.  I don't think they
	  currently build properly within the tree, by linking against
	  klibc, but patches to their Makefiles to fix this would be
	  gladly accepted :)
Thanks a lot to both Pat and Christophe for letting me include their
programs in the main udev release, I appreciate it.  And if there's any
other small programs that people want me to bundle within udev, please
let me know.
thanks,
