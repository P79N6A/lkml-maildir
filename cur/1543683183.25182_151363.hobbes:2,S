   But you cannot make this kind of decisions universal.
   Some kind of compromise should be found between arch-mantainers and 
subsystem-mantainers.
   Or beat GCC developer hard so they finally will produce good
optimizing compiler ;-)
   Or ask all kernel developpers to work one hour per week on GCC 
optimization - I bet GCC will outperform everything else in industry in 
  less that one year ;-)))
   To remind: source of the problem is not inlines, problem is the 
compiler, which cannot read our minds yet and generate code we were 
expected it to generate.
P.S. Offtopic. As I see it Linux & Linus have made the decision of 
optimization. Linux after all is capitalismus creation: who has more 
money do control everything. Server market has more money - they do more 
work on kernel and they systems are not that far from developers' 
workstations - so Linux gets more and more server/workstation oriented. 
This will fit desktop market too - if your computer was made to run 
WinXP AKA exp(bloat) - it will be capable to run any OS. Linus repeating 
'small is beatiful' sounds more and more like crude joke...
As for embedded market - it is already in deep fork and far far away 
from vanilla kernels... Vanilla really not that relevant to real world...
