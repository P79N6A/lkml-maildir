fping is not designed for flood pinging, and is normally being suid
root. If I want to keep current policy and make it more secure, I need
to give it enough permissions. But it checks euid() and fails. Which
is bug in my eyes. Unfortunately X behaves just the same.

Well, it is probably ok to consider just first note (constant
overhead). I'll modify addnote (done now) to force caps note the
first.

kmalloc is probably not too big problem (Jeremy tells me there are
other places like that), but it is ugly. I need constant ammount of
work better :-).
If elf capabilities are definitely 2.3ish (I do not see -- it is
really trivial patch), may I ask for having 2.3.0 soon?
