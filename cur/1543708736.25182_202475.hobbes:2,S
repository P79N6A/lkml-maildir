Hi,
I want to give the loaded system metrics(loadavg, io details etc) as the input to
the simulator program so that it is able to calculate the priority for any new job
that will be submitted.
Then knowing the execution time of that job in a no-load system, I am able to
compute the latency encountered becoz of the load on the system.
How can I reuse the sched.c code to do this?
Thank you
Regards
Sonika
