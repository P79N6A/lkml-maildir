Thanks,
This is the patch that deals with the format issue and removed the
return check of elf_dump_thread_status.
I think it's hard to drop the tasklist_lock  while we allocate the
memory unless we totally reorganize the elf_core_dump related functions
and data structures.

hm, OK, no worse than what we had there before :(
That GFP_ATOMIC allocation of one 824-byte-on-x86 structure for each
thread looks really, really nasty.  It could easily chew up 100% of the
page
reserves and fail.  I wonder if it is safe to drop the tasklist_lock
while we 
allocate the memory?
You're still testing for a zero return from elf_dump_thread_status().  I
think that with your changes, that is no longer possible, is it?
Please edit in 80-col xterms.  You'll find that a layout such as the
below
becomes more agreeable.
+		list_for_each(t, &thread_list) {
+			struct elf_thread_status *tmp;
+			int sz;
+
+			tmp = list_entry(t, struct elf_thread_status,
list);
+			sz = elf_dump_thread_status(signr, tmp);
