Subject: [PATCH 56/58] [GFS2] Fix page_mkwrite truncation race path
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Steven Whitehouse <swhiteho@redhat.com>
There was a bug in the truncation/invalidation race path for
->page_mkwrite for gfs2. It ought to return 0 so that the effect is the
same as if the page was truncated at any of the other points at which
the page_lock is dropped. This will result in the restart of the whole
page fault path. If it was due to a real truncation (as opposed to an
invalidate because we let a glock go) then the ->fault path will pick
that up when it gets called again.
