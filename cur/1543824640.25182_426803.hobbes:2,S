You explained some things last round, but there were still some
questions left open. The main question was regarding "additional
protection".
I'd be happy to change to code into something that you would feel
comfortable with, I just like to understand why. Having a
per-architecture data area in struct kimage is by far the simplest way
IMO.

That's one good thing at least I guess. =)

Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that. I took some time to split the
patches in the most logical way I could think of. The reason behind
not separating the segment code and the page_table_a code was that
they both touched more or less the same lines.
Let's figure out _what_ you want to merge, then let us decide in what
order to merge it. If we end up with more than 0 things to do then I'd
be happy to help out implementing them one by one.

Right. And I get offended by the strong works which is bad.
I think we both should try to stay cool, otherwise this will go nowhere.

And by global structure you mean the dynamically allocated struct
kimage? If you find that abusive then I think that _not_ using an
already existing structure is abusive. =)
I just want to keep things as simple as possible.
Thanks for your comments!
