So, makes sense. And the child process that follow will use now the new fd's.

So, it is not a requirement currently but it is useful to have the script not 
dependent on the current pivot_root implementation.

Sure will put in a script that does it. I had left it in /linuxrc as I thought 
that's what initrd.txt suggested one to do. But other information in the 
initrd.txt mentions otherwise, hence the query here.
I am assuming umount and thereby blockdev after pivot_script and before "chroot 
. init ..." don't make sense as files(dev/console among others) are\might still 
be in use.
Best Regards
Amit
