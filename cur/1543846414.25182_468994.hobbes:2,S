So, after testing two more days I can say the following:
I mirrored the partitions from the 300gb drive to a 6gb one.
The error does not occur on the small disk, neither when directly
connected to the motherboard's ide channel, nor when used through the
pci card (which was my hope). And although SMART says everything is ok,
it seems to me as if the harddrive is broken somehow. Great.
Thanks for all your help!
