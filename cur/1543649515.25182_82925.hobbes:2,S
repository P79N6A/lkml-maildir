Are you sure that it's really CS4231?
If it's a higher model, such as cs4232, cs4235 or cs4236, FM OPL3 is
already supported (although additional codes to opl3 module are
necessary for PC9800).

The MPU401 hack looks odd.
I'd propose to split a PC9800 specific driver up, rather than
including bunch of ifdefs...
