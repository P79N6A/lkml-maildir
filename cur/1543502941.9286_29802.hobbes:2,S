You are aware that RedHat issued a 2.2.5-22 kernel over a month ago?
According to RedHat's errata page, this was to fix as vulnerability in
the kernel, but I can state that the -22 kernel is far more stable on
my systems than the -15 kernel was...

That's probably a good idea anyway - there's quite a few bugs fixed
between 2.2.5 and 2.2.10 so you're probably better off jumping
straight to the latter...

They usually are...
