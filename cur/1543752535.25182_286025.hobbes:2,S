If it can help, I'm writing this on a 2.6.10-bk14 kernel. So it's just
the final bits going into 2.6.11-rc1 that pushed the bug on. At
least on my machine.
Can't find any incremental bk14->rc1 to finalize that statement, though.
Ok kernels, from 2.6.10, that I've compiled and run now is: -bk7, -bk11,
-bk13 and -bk14.
