Hi,

Im seeing bootup crashes every now and then on a ppc64 box too. A few
other things Ive noticed:
- nr_running looks to be wrong. On an idle machine just after booting:
00:07:20 up 14 min,  3 users,  load average: 8.00, 7.67, 4.95
Its a 4 core 8 thread machine, so perhaps we are counting idle threads.
- The printk had me confused, we are really mapping cpu2 onto cpu1s runqueue.
Patch below.
- I tried the HT scheduler with NUMA enabled. Same machine, 4 core 8
threads, each NUMA node has 2 cores, 4 threads. Its easy to end up in a sub
optimal state:
 Cpu0 :   0.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice, 100.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu1 :   0.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice, 100.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu2 : 100.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice,   0.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu3 : 100.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice,   0.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu4 : 100.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice,   0.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu5 :   0.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice, 100.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu6 : 100.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice,   0.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu7 :   0.7% user,   0.7% system,   0.0% nice,  98.6% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
cpu0/1 are an SMT pair, cpu 0-3 are a NUMA node. As you can see cpu0/1
is free and cpu2/3 is busy on both threads. So far we have noticed
nr_cpus_node should probably be nr_runqueues_node now, otherwise the 
inter node balancing code could make bad decisions. However in this case
the imbalance is within the node, so Im not sure why cpu0/1 runqueue
hasnt stolen a task from cpu2/3.
