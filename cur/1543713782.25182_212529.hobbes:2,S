you need to use an initrd if you want mount-by-label to work for your
root filesystem.
on a RHL or Fedora system (and I suspect other distros too but I don't
know for sure) just doing a "make install" in the kernel source will
make one for you and put the kernel you just build into the grub config
etc etc etc.
