Yes, I know, and if you could send me a ref I'd like to add it to
credits. BTW, is what I see in autoconf.h a complete list of
possible kernel options or only those related to the current selection?
I count 600 odd plain options in autoconf.h, and 1400 or 1500 grepping
the kernel sources. The difference is considerable. I threw away the
_MODULE variants in both cases.
