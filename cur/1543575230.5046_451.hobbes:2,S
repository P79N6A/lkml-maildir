Hi Jens,
I have tested your latest stuff (cd-2) with the CD that was
causing problems before.  The problems still occur.
The CD plays fine, but I get the following errors in
my /var/log/messages:
Dec  8 06:05:29 agate kernel: hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { 
DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
Dec  8 06:05:29 agate kernel: hdc: packet command error: error=0x50
Dec  8 06:05:29 agate kernel: ATAPI device hdc:
Dec  8 06:05:29 agate kernel:   Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
Dec  8 06:05:29 agate kernel:   Invalid field in command packet -- 
(asc=0x24, ascq=0x00)
Dec  8 06:05:29 agate kernel:   The failed "Play Audio MSF" packet 
command was:
Dec  8 06:05:29 agate kernel:   "47 00 00 00 02 00 3f 24 ff 00 00 00 "
Dec  8 06:05:29 agate kernel:   Error in command packet byte 8 bit 0
Dec  8 06:05:29 agate kernel: Play from track 1 to 9
Dec  8 06:05:29 agate kernel: lba 0 to lba 286050
Here's a pointer to the CD that is causing trouble.  Perhaps
you could buy a copy and sort this out.  It's a great CD!

Thanks,
