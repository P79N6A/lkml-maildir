Subject: Mouse input corrupted under X 3.3.3.1 with kernel 2.2.12

I tried to run kernel 2.2.12 on a system with X 3.3.3.1 and the Creative
Banshee server installed. Under 2.2.12, mouse behavior was erratic in that
as I move the mouse left or right, the pointer would move in random
directions. Also, the fvwm2 menus would appear as if a mouse button was
being pressed, when in fact I wasn't pressing anything.
As near as I can tell, this seems to be caused by upgrading to 2.2.12.
When I boot with 2.2.11-ac3 everything works perfectly. I'd really rather
use 2.2.12 so I can apply the ide.2.2.12.patch to gain support for my
Promise Ultra66 controller, and also have the fix for some CD-ROM access
problems.
System config is as follows:
- Tyan 1846s motherboard with PII/400 and 128MB
- 3dfx Banshee with 16MB
- Logitech MouseMan running off ttyS0
- Debian 2.1 / XFree86 3.3.3.1 + Creative Labs Banshee server
- 2.2.12 + ide.2.2.12.patch corrupts mouse input to X
- 2.2.11-ac3 works as expected
Any pointers would be greatly appreciated. I can try to provide more
information as needed.
Thanks,
Alec
