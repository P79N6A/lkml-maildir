hm, OK, that sucks.
But the deadlock still exists with Rusty's patches, doesn't it?  We
still have a single kernel thread per CPU processing all the unrelated
work_on_cpu() callers.  All we've done is to decouple work_on_cpu()
from the keventd queue.
If correct, we'd need to create a gaggle of kernel threads on each call
to work_on_cpu(), which doesn't sound nice.
A more efficient but trickier approach would be to create kernel
threads within flush_work(), with which to run the CPU-specific
worklet.  We only need to do that in the case where the CPU's keventd
thread was off doing something and might deadlock, which will be rare. 
If the keventd was just parked waiting for something to do then we can
safely feed it the to-be-flushed work item for immediate processing.
It'd be saner to just say "don't call work_on_cpu() while holding locks" :(
I bet there's some lockdep infrastructre which we could peek into to
add the assertion check...
