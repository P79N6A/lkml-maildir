Have there been problems with the API during the past 5 months, except 
that several kernel trees are using some parts of the API? (We are 
actually speaking about two APIs of the ieee1394 framework.)
Which problems are solved by this patch? Do they outweigh the problems 
it creates? The latter have been discussed. Dismissing them as Other 
People's Problems does not nullify them.
Where is the agreed-upon, published plan for removal of features in 
ieee1394?
