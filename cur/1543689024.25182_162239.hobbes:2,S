But I am neutral about this.  One thing that BUG_ON() gives is that the
if has an unlikely() in it, so it at least guarantees some improved
semantics.
Another bit is that we have historically avoided conditional code (i.e.,
cruft like smp_if() etc. that you see elsewhere) like this.  Maybe
renaming this "might_sleep_on()" at least brings it more in line with
BUG_ON(), and avoids looking like the gross constructs I fear.

Great.

Even better.
