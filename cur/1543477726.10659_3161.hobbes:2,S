Speaking of which, I put on my fool's cap once more and realized I still
have a problem with the deprecated major-4 pty changes mentioned in
Documentation/Changes.  Problem is, it is discussed in the middle of a
paragraph that begins and ends with the topic of optional Unix98 pty
stuff.  That is very confusing to us teflon-jackets, who will think
they are somehow related.
So I suggest the minor editorial change in the following patch against
Changes.
