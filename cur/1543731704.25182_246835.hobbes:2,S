I'm a bit squeamish about that given that mmlist_lock and tasklist_lock
are both problematic and yet another global structure to fiddle with in
the process creation and destruction path threatens similar trouble.
Also, what guarantee is there that the notification events come
sufficiently slowly for a single task to process, particularly when that
task may not have a whole cpu's resources to marshal to the task?
Queueing them sounds less than ideal due to resource consumption, and
if notifications are dropped most of the efficiency gains are lost. So
I question that a bit.
I have a vague notion that userspace should intelligently schedule
inquiries so requests are made at a rate the app can process and so
that the app doesn't consume excessive amounts of cpu. In such an
arrangement screen refresh events don't trigger a full scan of the
tasklist, but rather only an incremental partial rescan of it, whose
work is limited for the above cpu bandwidth concerns.

I'm expecting very very long lifetimes for legacy kernel versions and
userspace predating the merge of nproc, so it's not entirely irrelevant,
though backports aren't exactly something I relish.

task_mem() is generally prominent when the processes have large numbers
of vmas, and also due to acquisition of ->mmap_sem.
