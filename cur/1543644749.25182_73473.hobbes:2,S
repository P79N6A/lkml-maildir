Monday afternoon (my time) I grabbed the current BK tree and have been
using it since then. The problem has been reduced. I thought it was
fixed, but just as I sent this message, I tried my little test again,
and in one of the three runs I had a 21 second stall. I waited a few
minutes between tests.
Is your patch meant for the latest BK tree? Or something older?
