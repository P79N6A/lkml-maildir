Subject: 2.4.20: CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC and CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC won't allow me to connect with my ADSL

I just installed an ECS K7VTA3 5.0 and ADSL. I was using an
ASUS A7S333 and cable modem.
With a kernel compiled with CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC and
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC adsl-start will timeout. adsl-connect also
fails.
There's a " WARNING: unexpected IO-APIC, please mail to
linux-smp@vger.kernel.org" in dmesg.
With a kernel compiled without CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC and
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC I can succesfully establish a connection.
My APIC disabled .config is available at
http://www.fredlwm.hpg.com.br/.config-2.4.20-NOAPIC
My APIC disabled dmesg available at
http://www.fredlwm.hpg.com.br/dmesg-2.4.20-NOAPIC
My APIC enabled dmesg is available at
