In lk 2.5 we are hoping that driverfs will give us an
"information bridge" between scsi pseudo devices
and other driver subsystems such as ide, usb and iee1394.
Mike Sullivan's persistent naming patch (that I mentioned
in my previous post on this thread) adds driverfs capability
into the scsi subsystem. Driverfs capability is already
in the ide and usb subsystems.
procfs, driverfs and devfs ...
