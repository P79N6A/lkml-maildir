Kernel 2.5.17
Should the compiler be blamed or the code?
gcc 2.96 compiles it. 3.1 won't.
Before people yell at me to use the recommended compiler, I would like to say
that it really wouldn't solve the problem. Compilers move forward, the code 
has to comply. Therefore I'm excersing my right to ignore all warnings about 
my compiler and use it. If this is a bug in the compiler, I'd agree and 
switch back to 2.96. Otherwise I'd suggest the code be changed.
Comments or advice?
