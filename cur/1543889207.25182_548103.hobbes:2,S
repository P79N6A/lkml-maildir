Because then you get a slew of fun issues with dropping the final reference
to vfsmount vs. lookup on another place.  What hold do you have on that
superblock and when do you switch from "oh, called ->enter() on the same
inode again, return vfsmount over the same superblock" to "need to
initialize that damn superblock, all mounts are gone"?

So what kind of exclusion do you have for ->enter()?  None?
