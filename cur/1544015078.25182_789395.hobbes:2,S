If they send it from distro kernels the automated oops sender could
just fetch the debuginfo rpm and decode it down to a line.
My old automatic user segfault uploader I did originally
for the core pipe code did that too.

Ok you're saying we should pay the 4.1% by default for this?
If you want that you can apply the appended patch.
Not sure if it's really a good idea though. 4.1% is a lot.

Disable inlining of functions called once by default
This makes oopses easier to read because it's clearer in which
function the problem is.
Disadvantage: costs ~4.1% of text size (measured with allyesconfig
on gcc 4.1 on x86-64)
