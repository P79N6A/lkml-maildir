I've built it up after a make mrproper. Sadly, it takes
real    41m36.167s
user    37m46.830s
sys     3m0.150s,
according to time.
Anyway, it works now. Thanks.
I just didn't think something could be wrong with the configuration, since
I didn't change anything, I just did a make oldconfig after the patching
from pre3 to pre4 and it didn't work.
I did some configuration tweaking after that, but always a make dep ; make
clean before compiling.
Thanks,
