I'm the current maintainer of e2compr.  I continue to work on it, but I've
announced my desire that someone else take on `maintainer' title, as for
quite some time I've been busy with other things.

Nope.  The change to Linux' write mechanism in early 2.3 (namely having
writes go through writepage instead of having ext2_file_write create disk
buffers) means that there's no longer a convenient place to do the
compression (in the most common case, where we wish to compress more than
a page full at a time).  Probably the fix is to organise for multiple pages
to be written at once.  It just requires that someone spend a chunk of time
getting familiar with how pages usually get written out, and the locking
issues and so on.  Stephen, since you're already familiar with both the mm
system and ext2, can you comment on that plan?
Thanks,
pjm.
