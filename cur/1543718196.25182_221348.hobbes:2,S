There it is hidden in arch/arm/mm/ioremap.c
look at the L_ flags there and how L_PTE_CACHEABLE is missing there by default.
PS: This can be found easily with grep. Try this little Bash script to grep recursively 
      through the kernel and answer your questions more quickly:
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
        PROGNAME=`basename $0`
        echo -e "$PROGNAME - find a string in a tree of *.c and *.h files"
        echo -e "Usage:\t$PROGNAME <start dir> <what>\n"
        exit 1
fi
DIR=$1
shift
exec find "${DIR}" -type f -name '*.[ch]' -print0 |xargs -0 grep -A8 "$@"
