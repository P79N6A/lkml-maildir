Just as an anecdote - I built a variant of container_of to protect against
cases where NULL can creep in:
#define test_container_of(ptr, type, member) ({               \
        const typeof( ((type *)0)->member ) *__p = (ptr);     \
        __p ? container_of(__p, type, member) : NULL;})
It calls the real container_of only if 'ptr' is not NULL.
