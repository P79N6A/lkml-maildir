Hi Linus,
is there any reason why this patch (from John Reiser) didn't make it into
your tree?

I think it's a good idea to have a defined state on process startup, if you
want to debug things by comparing two runs of a program.
It might also prevent information leak between programs.
This might not be the most important issue, but on the other hand, we can
spend this 3 CPU cycles (on modern CPUs) to clear 6 more registers ...
