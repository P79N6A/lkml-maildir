If this is an SMP system, then you could just be getting random results,
depending upon which CPU is attempting the poweroff.
I have a newish patch in Andrew's tree now to fix SMP poweroff
(has been broken forever), reproduced here below in case you missed it.
* * *
We need to disable all CPUs other than the boot CPU (usually 0)
before attempting to power-off modern SMP machines.
This fixes the hang-on-poweroff issue on my MythTV SMP box,
and also on Thomas Gleixner's new toybox.
