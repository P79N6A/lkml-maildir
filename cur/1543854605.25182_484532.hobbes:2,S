Linus,
We've solved a few bugs at some drivers.
Please pull 'master' from:
        git://git.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mchehab/v4l-dvb.git master
It contains the following:
Some DVBS boards are miss-identified. Those two patches fixes it:
   - Fix tuning on older budget DVBS cards.
   - Budget: diseqc_method module parameter for cards with subsystem-id 13c2:1003
A var is not initialized at DVB core frontend zigzag:
   - Fix uninitialised variable in dvb_frontend_swzigzag
Spin unlock missing:
   - Add missing spin_unlock to saa6588 decoder driver
Lack of proper releasing the module:
   - Fix: Slot 0 not NULL on disconnecting SN9C10x PC Camera
Cheers,
Mauro.
