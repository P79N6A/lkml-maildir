Correct, makes it easier for other modules to request the SSC peripheral
and get access to the registers and irq.
The AT73C213 sound driver was submitted to the alsa-dev list.

I disagree, by using the model above the user does not have to know the
bit field offsets as they will need with the defines in
include/asm-arm/arch-at91/at91_ssc.h.
Just an example from sound/soc/at91/at91-ssc.c
rcmr =	  (( ssc_p->rcmr_period		<< 24) & AT91_SSC_PERIOD)
			| (( 1				<< 16) & AT91_SSC_STTDLY)
			| (( AT91_SSC_START_FALLING_RF	     ) & AT91_SSC_START)
			| (( AT91_SSC_CK_RISING		     ) & AT91_SSC_CKI)
			| (( AT91_SSC_CKO_NONE		     ) & AT91_SSC_CKO)
			| (( AT91_SSC_CKS_DIV		     ) & AT91_SSC_CKS);
Would with the header style for atmel-ssc be:
rcmr = SSC_BF(RCMR_PERIOD, ssc_p->rcmr_period)
		| SSC_BF(RCMR_STTDLY, 1)
		| SSC_BF(RCMR_START, 4)
		| SSC_BF(RCMR_CKI, 1)
		| SSC_BF(RCMR_CKO, 0)
		| SSC_BF(RCMR_CKS, 0);
I find the latter more readable and compact, the user also does not need
to know the offset of the different bit-fields.
I agree that describing names for the different bit-fields is nice.
Similar to the way the AVR32 standalone headers are built up.
