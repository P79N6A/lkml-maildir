Good point. Some versions of cp handle holes, but you can't expect to
change the network protocols to handle them.
However, not all is lost. If you had an expanding filesystem (i.e. a
filesystem that could ask for more space from the block device
driver), then you could remove the need for holes.
Anyway, like I said, it wasn't my idea. I'm just passing it on ;-)
