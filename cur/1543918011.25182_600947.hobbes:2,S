Looks like it's caused by enabling vmerge (which tends to be on for the
common PPC defconfigs). If I disable it, things look OK.
Perhaps the Marvell controller doesn't like requests larger than 64K,
or wrapping some boundary. Do you have access to erratas/docs?
I have verified it on a powermac now as well (had a quick scare that it
might have been some problem with the PA Semi IOMMU, but no).
