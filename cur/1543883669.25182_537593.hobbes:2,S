After complete 2 day usage, i still can't reproduce previous problems. And 
even can manage to burn a dvd with k3b with one console compiles kernel, 
other checkouts svn repos, amarok plays music, virtualbox boots another 
distro and with 3 tab opened firefox setup :). And i must say system was 
still usable at that time the only thing happened was a little firefox 
slowdown but its really negligable cause with mainline firefox/whole system 
really unusable if i fire a guest in virtualbox.
And lastly boot time still around ~20 sec. which is expected
