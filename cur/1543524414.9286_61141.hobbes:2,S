FWIW, even in the SCSI-1 spec, 10-byte reads were mandatory for CDROM and
WORM devices, and 6-byte reads were optional.  (It is that way in the
SCSI-2 spec, and I think in the MMC specs as well.)
The way we handle this in FreeBSD is to specify a minimum command size in
the function that builds read and write CCBs.  The function will then
select the smallest read/write command size that will satisfy the minimum
command size, and that will also hold the block number and transfer size.
In the CD driver, we just set the minimum command size to 10, since CDROM
and WORM drives don't have to support 6 byte reads.  (The minimum command
size is set to 6 in the disk driver, unless the drive is quirked
otherwise, since 6 byte reads are still mandatory for disks.)
