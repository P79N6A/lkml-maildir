Hello,
The following program:
main()
{
    for(;;)
        sleep(1);
}
should use very little CPU time. When it is first started, it doesn't
show anything being used. However, run this over a weekend! It will
show up in `top` as consuming 100% of the CPU time after a few days.
The machine seems as lively as ever so it's likely not using any
significant CPU time. It's probably some reporting/accounting problem.
I have tried this now on two 2.4.1 machines. Both are Pentium III,
600 MHz (coppermine), SMP.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
