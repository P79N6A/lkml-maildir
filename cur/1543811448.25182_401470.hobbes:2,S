The possibility to keep INPUT=m makes a big sense in that it keeps the
interfaces to the rest of the kernel clean. No direct linking, no
callbacks into inner functions from elsewhere, etc. Nicely isolated.
Even with ACPI, the part that will use input will usually be modular,
too.
The only big user of INPUT, which can't be modular at the time is
CONFIG_VT. And this, I believe, is a bug.
