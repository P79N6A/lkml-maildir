 Hello,
   with respect to commit e9e2cdb412412326c4827fc78ba27f410d837e6e 
 and the thread at [1] I just wanted to let you all know that
 the problem is still present :)
 I tried several combo of options, but only acpi=off or acpi=ht
 will let the PC boot.
 I'm trying to debug it.. any help/pointers are appreciated. I dont't
 have a deep knowledge of the subsystems involved.
