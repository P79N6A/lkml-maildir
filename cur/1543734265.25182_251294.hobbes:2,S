Jon,
   Alan did have a valid point about the current size of DRM driver.
   Would it not be possible to separate parts that assist 3d acceleration -
like DRM ioctls to submit textures etc and the code to validate the 
command stream submitted from userspace ? This should cut down the size
considerably.
                               best
