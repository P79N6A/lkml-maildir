: 2.5.68 and later have depreciated devpts support in devfs.  Thus
: you have to enable:
: 
:  CONFIG_DEVPTS_FS=y
: 
: and mount it during boot.  Easy way is just to add to fstab:
: 
: ------------------
: none	/dev/pts	devpts	defaults	0 0
: ------------------
Sure enough that was it.  Darn it.  I must have missed that change entirely.
I was compiling in devpts but still figured it was mutually exclusive with
devfs (which I am using).
Thanks
