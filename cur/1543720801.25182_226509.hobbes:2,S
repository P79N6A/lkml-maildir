I have a machine running with an ICH6R Intel chipset.
I've been watching the LKML for info on my ICH6R
chipset's AHCI mode support. It has been a month since
the last SATA status report so I figured I'd write to
ask: Does anyone know when the preliminary AHCI driver
will be integrated into libata mainline? If so I
assume it will be a patch against the 2.6.x kernel?
Also, are there plans to release a version of iswraid 
for ICH6R against 2.6.x?
