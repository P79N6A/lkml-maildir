Here are the contest results for 2.5.43-mm1:

Whatever it was that was making it take longer in 2.5.42-mm3 has made it go 
back to that of 2.5.43 vanilla. Note this is slower than 2.5.42 which is 
slower than 2.4.19.

The context switching has gone mad here and done heaps more work at the 
expense of kernel compilation time. No cpu time appears to have been wasted 
though.
