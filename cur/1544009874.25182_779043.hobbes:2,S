Subject: [PATCH][v2] fork_init: fix division by zero
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/10/205

The following patch fixes divide-by-zero error for the
cases of really big PAGE_SIZEs (e.g. 256KB on ppc44x).
Support for big page sizes on 44x is not present in the
current kernel yet, but coming soon.
Also this patch fixes the comment for the max_threads
settings, as this didn't match the things actually done
in the code.
