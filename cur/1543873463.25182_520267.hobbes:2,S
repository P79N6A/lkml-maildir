Yes, I think that's what he meant.

I don't like the idead of changing the driver API for PCI device setup.
But if it's necessary to solve this class of problem, I think it's ok.

Please update Documentation/pci.txt to reflect the API changes too.

Agreed. ISTR this has been discussed before but don't recall
the exact context. I'll try to find the previous thread.
When I started the parisc port on 2.4 kernels, the policy was to
leave all interrupts enabled even if no interrupt handler was registered.
This is useful for debugging misconfigured IRQ routing.
Did the policy already change or is this a proposal to change the policy?
thanks,
