Hi to all,
a simple question the answer to witch I didn't find in CodingStyle.
Look for a code snip:
	err = foo(arg_a, arg_b, arg_c,
		arg_d);
the second line contains 'd' arg aligned with tabs only
but it could be rewritten with more elegant style (by adding
a few spaces) like this
	err = foo(arg_a, arg_b, arg_c,
		  arg_d);
so which one is preferred for the kernel?
