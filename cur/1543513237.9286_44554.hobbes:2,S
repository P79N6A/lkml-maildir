Hello!

In no curcumstances. "ifconfig" and "route" are classic tools,
which cannot be deprecated.

We behave exactly as all 4.4BSD based systems behave.
Seems, under identification "all" you mean sunos, right? 8)
At least, I do not know about another OSes but sunos-5.x and linux-2.0,
where colon aliases were used seriously.
Linux is not the first OS making transition from 4.2BSD view
to 4.4 one, so that the problem is not new. F.e. Digital Unix had 4.2BSD
looking ifconfig showing only the first address for years 8)8)
I'd prefer that "ifconfig" preserved its 4.2BSD look, but not
emulated silly sunos behaviour in details. It is exactly the thing
which current net-tools do.
Certainly you will fail to describe qdiscs etc. using 4.2BSD terms.
