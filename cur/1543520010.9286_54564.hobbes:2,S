Subject: kernel v2.0.38 boot conflict between IDE, SCSI and 3Com network card.

Hi,
    I'm running linux 2.0.38 with libc5.4.46 and egcs v1.0.3 as the compiler.
Here are some problems I'm having with this kernel version.
Hardware:
        333mhz Dell optiplex GX1
        2940U2W AIC7895
        Western Digital 9.1G SCSI disk
        Quantum Fireball 1.2G IDE disk
        3Com 3c59x  ethernet card.
Problem:
   1). I've compiled kernel v2.0.38 for a minimal system and a system
       that has alot of options selected. 
   2). I'm booting a UMSDOS filesystem off the IDE drive and trying to
       mount the SCSI disk and am running into problems.
       a).If the SCSI kernel config options "are not" compiled
       into the kernel, but Zip100 module support is compiled for the
       2.0.38 kernel, the system will boot ok and I can use my 3COM network
       card to ping the world. The 3Com network driver is "insmod'" as a 
       module. See listing (A) below.
       b). If SCSI kernel config options "are" compiled
       into the kernel, and ZIP100 module support is compiled for the
       2.0.38 kernel, the system "will not" boot and will just hang
       after recognizing the SCSI adapter card but willl not finish
       or display the " XXX instructions downloaded" for Narrow channel B
       although Wide Channel A instructions were downloaded. The SCSI disk
       WDE 9.1G will not be found and the 3Com network driver isn't loaded.
       See listing (B) below.
       c).  If SCSI kernel config options "are" compiled
       into the kernel, and ZIP100 module support is compiled for the
       2.0.38 kernel, the system "will" boot and recognize the SCSI disk
       IF AND ONLY IF the 3Com network support "isn't" compiled into the
       kernel. However, since the 3c59x.o 3Com network module from a
       previous compile exists (even with symbol versioning) it will get
       loaded into the kernel via modprobe without problem. But, the
        only thing I can do with this is to telnet/ftp/ping my local
        subnet and can't get to the outside world although IP forwarding
        was compiled into the kernel and all the other various protocols to.
        See listing (C) below.
CONCLUSION:
     1). Both channels share the same interrupt #11 and the 3Com card also
         gets interrupt 11. In /proc/interrupts there is "aic7xxx aic7xxx eth0"
         on this interrupt with the IDE drive on interrupt 15 and Crystal
         sound support with MIDI on interrupt 9.
     2). Disabling kernel built in 3Com support when SCSI disk capabilities
         are selected will allow the SCSI adapter and disk to be recognized
         fully and mounted. With 3Com support, the system will hang during
         system boot.
     3). These configurations were only done for kernel v2.0.38 when UMSDOS
         boots off an IDE drive trying to detect and mount a SCSI vs. UMSDOS
         booting off a SCSI and trying to mount an IDE. NOTE: I have
         UMSDOS kernel v2.2.1 booting off the SCSI and mounting this IDE
         drive without problems. The selection of the Interrupts 11 for
         the network and SCSI adaptor are the same as above with the IDE
         on interrupt 15. I just haven't tried to put kernel v2.0.38 on
         the SCSI to boot and mount the IDE.
     4). A problem I had earlier this year when I had kernel 2.0.34 and
         was booting the IDE drive and trying to detect the SCSI adapter
	 and disk, and which exhibited similar boot problems, occurred under the
         following condition. When the computer booted and autoexec.bat
         loaded the vlm/nvlm novell drivers along with the DOS based
         3Com network drivers, followed by the linux v2.0.34 OS by
         loadlin v1.6a, it would hang in the same spot. This I suppose
         was due to the linux kernel fighting with the MSDOS based
         network drivers for the network card interrupts whils't it
         was trying to detect the SCSI disk, although the kernel load
         sequence hadn't tried to sync and modprobe the 3c59x.o kernel
         module yet. Hence the SCSI adaptor interrupts for the kernel where
         fighting for the DOS based network driver interrupts. The solution
         here was to not load any DOS based 3Com network drivers nor
         any vlm/nvlm novell drivers and the system booted ok off the
         IDE disk. However, in my current situation, I'm not loading
         any DOS or novell drivers.
QUESTION:
        Any suggestions? i can send you my config file in for the 
        cases above.
