Yeah, -- the idea is to identify which changes are relevant
using some other criteria, not "git tree placement" or something
like that -- example is to use directory as you suggested (plus
relevant includes).

Yeah -- like git-diff-tree -M, I used it before (for this libata stuff
as well), and even wrote a tiny shell wrapper around patch(1) to
apply git-diff-tree -M -generated patch - first pass is to handle
renames in shell, and second pass is to apply the patch itself... ;)
Thanks.
