Hello
On a busy server (dual Xeon with 4GB ram) running plain 2.6.11.11 form
kernel.org (distribution is Fedora Core 2) I got the following error:
Jun  4 11:40:55 apollo kernel: Assertion failure in journal_commit_transaction() at fs/jbd/commit.c:768: "jh->b_next_transaction == ((void *)0)"
Jun  4 11:40:55 apollo kernel: ------------[ cut here ]------------
Jun  4 11:40:55 apollo kernel: kernel BUG at fs/jbd/commit.c:768!
Jun  4 11:40:55 apollo kernel: invalid operand: 0000 [#1]
Jun  4 11:45:07 apollo syslogd 1.4.1: restart.
The system bootet automatically, from the ipmi motherboard logs I can see
that the hardware watchdog has reset the system at 11:42:55.
It's using an ext3 on top of a software raid10 (three raid1 combined with
raid0 over 6 SCSI disks). None of the software raids needed to rebuild after
the crash.
Any idea why the kernel stopped? The system has been running stable for a
year now.
If I forgot any information please ask so I can provide them.
Thanks,
Holger
