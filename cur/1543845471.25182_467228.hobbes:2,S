They are always interchangeable.  fget_light() is simply an optimised,
messier-to-use version.

I suppose so.  Or just stick the declaration into kernel.h.
I had a patch go past the other day which had a hand-rolled
fast-but-not-very-good pseudo random number generator in it.  I couldn't
remember where I'd seen one, and now I can't remember what patch it was
that needed it.  Sigh.
Anyway, a standalone patch which adds that function into lib/whatever.c
would be nice.
