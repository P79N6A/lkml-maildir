there's a good paper related to this published in the OSDI '99
proceedings. see:
Chang, F., Gibson, G., "Automatic I/O Hint Generation through Speculative
Execution," Proceedings of the Third Symposium on Operating Systems Design
and Implementation, pp. 1-14, February 1999.
the authors used speculative execution during I/O waits to predict future
read requests instead of the method you described.  their conclusion was
that were good gains from speculative execution, but the technique
requires significant O/S complexity.
