Thanks for your fast reply.
As I do not have access to my work machine from home I could only answer today, 
and try what I might, I am not able to reproduce the mentioned behaviour any more.
The first thing I tried last Wednesday was to pull out an unused Adaptec 
AHA-2940U SCSI controller which happened to be in the machine for testing 
purposes only.
This "fixed" the network cards as well and now reinserting the SCSI adapter does 
not break them again, neither can I reproduce the "nobody cared" message. 
Unfortunately I also overwrote the saved dmesg from a boot where the network 
cards *did* break.
So the only thing I have is a dmesg (which I cannot reproduce) where irqpoll 
seems to have fixed the problem, and apart form the missing "nobody cares" plus 
the backtrace, it differs from the current one in the order the hardware is 
detected.
I'll be more cautious to save useful information if said behaviour raises its 
ugly head again, but for now, thanks and sorry for the noise.
