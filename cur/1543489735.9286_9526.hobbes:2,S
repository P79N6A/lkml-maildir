Hi, heres the jargon:-
PCI_IDE: unknown IDE controller on PCI bus 00 device 58, VID=10b9,
DID=5229
PCI_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PCI_IDE: simplex device:  DMA disabled
ide0: PCI_IDE Bus-Master DMA disabled (BIOS)
PCI_IDE: simplex device:  DMA disabled
ide1: PCI_IDE Bus-Master DMA disabled (BIOS)
hda: ST33210A, ATA DISK drive
hdb: WDC AC35100L, ATA DISK drive
hdd: FX240S, ATAPI CDROM drive
Board = micom TX pro plus i think (not sure :/)
both drives are UDMA and windows recognises' them as such.
bios = award 1997
this is with all the chipset's compiled in (i reported this last year, but
never got back around to checking it afraid :/)
The bios say's it support upto UDMA2
any ideas?
