This was about the fifth time when i experienced the following:
all of a sudden, my keyboard and mouse (both together, at exactly the same
time), stop responding, ie i can't type or move the mouse around. As the
keyboard stop responding, i also can't use the Magic-key. All other things
go on, process continue to run, i can see everything, but the only thing i
can do is to press the reset button. (It seems that if had an other
machine i could log in via network and shut it down.) Last time i had this
problem about 10 seconds after starting X, but i also met this whitout X
(while running for example mc).
It might hw related, but i have no idea how could i go for sure (please
don't tell me to try it under win :))
I'm running 2.4.1, the mainboard is an Abit VP6, with PS/2 keyboard and
mouse.
