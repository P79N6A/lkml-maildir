My bad.
I habitually apply the "send-to-self" patch, since some of the 
network testing that I do is easiest if I load up the all of the 
adapters in the same box. (If you're not familiar with this patch ... 
its great, and I wish it was integratedd into mainline. It allows
one to drive network traffic through the physical devices, even
if they are in the same box.  Without it, the network stack is
too clever, and won't allow you to do this.)

Yes, in retrospect, this would have been the simplest solution.

Sigh. Silly me. Haste makes waste.
