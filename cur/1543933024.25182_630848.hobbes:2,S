Fujita said "need" which confused me.  I already said it should be handed
down as an optimization; I was curious what I had broken :)

Absolutely.  In fact, I think the sg_ring header would be made safer if it
had the "dma_num" in it as well: it's more explicit and less surprising to
the caller than mangling sg->num.
How are these two patches then?
===
Introduce sg_ring: a ring of scatterlist arrays.
This patch introduces 'struct sg_ring', a layer on top of scatterlist
arrays.  It meshes nicely with routines which expect a simple array of
'struct scatterlist' because it is easy to break down the ring into
its constituent arrays.
The sg_ring header also encodes the maximum number of entries, useful
for routines which populate an sg.  We need never hand around a number
of elements any more.

dma_map_sg_ring() helper
Obvious counterpart to dma_map_sg.  Note that this is arch-independent
code; sg_rings are backwards compatible with simple sg arrays.
