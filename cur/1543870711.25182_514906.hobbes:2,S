We tested them.  They only alleviate the problem slightly in
good situations, but things still fall apart badly with less
friendly workloads.

Your attitude is exactly why the VM keeps falling apart over
and over again.
Fixing "a testcase" in the VM tends to introduce problems for
other test cases, ad infinitum. There's a reason we end up
fixing the same bugs over and over again.
I have been looking through a few hundred VM related bugzillas
and have found the same bugs persist over many different
versions of Linux, sometimes temporarily fixed, but they seem
to always come back eventually...

I will test my changes before I send them to you, but I cannot
promise you that you'll have the computers or software needed
to reproduce the problems.  I doubt I'll have full time access
to such systems myself, either.
32GB is pretty much the minimum size to reproduce some of these
problems. Some workloads may need larger systems to easily trigger
them.
