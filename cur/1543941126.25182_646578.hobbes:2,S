Ok, I've pulled this. It conflicted with some NFS changes, but I did what 
appeared to be the obvious conflict resolution, and it all at least 
compiles and it looked sane to me. But I don't have NFS enabled normally, 
and I certainly don't have a good way to test with my laptop while in 
Melbourne, so Trond/Matthew, can you please double- and triple-check my 
merge?
