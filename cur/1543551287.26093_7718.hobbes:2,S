I much prefered the dirty fault version.
What does "quite noticeable" mean? Does it mean that you can see page
faults (no big deal), or does it mean that you can actually measure the
performance degradation objectively?
Also, this version doesn't seem to fix the bug.

Both of the above paths can cause the dirty bit to be dropped again, as
far as I can see.
In fact, you seem to have _added_ those drops in this patch. What's up?
I'm not going to apply a patch that I don't see will even fix the problem
at this point.
I _will_ apply the "exception on dirty" version, if you remove the SMP
special case (ie you do it unconditionally). At least that one I believe
really fixes the problem.
