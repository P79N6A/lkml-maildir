Why would it do something stupid like that?
All I know is, I buy my 1.44 floppies unformatted (as they're cheaper
that way), and use the following command to format them:
	mke2fs /dev/fd0		<= What DOS calls A:
	mke2fs /dev/fd1		<= What DOS calls B:
	mke2fs /dev/fd2		<= What DOS calls G:
	mke2fs /dev/sda4	<= What DOS calls H:
All work quite happily...
Best wishes from Riley.
