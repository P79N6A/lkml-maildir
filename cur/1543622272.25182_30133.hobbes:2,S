Before I truley reply to this statement above, would you like to recant it?

Here I question the taking of a patch 12 which altered the behavior of the
subsystem baseclock to setting up PIO timings for the executing command
block operations.  I then looked over the patch again and saw you had not
taken it yet.
In that private email, I clearly stated I made a mistake in reading what
was accepted into 2.5.5.  The fact is you had not accepted it yet.
However I expect you will take it.  Given that very few people in the
world have most of the hardware that was effected by that change, and even
less have the NDA documents on the rules, please accept the change.

If this line has be crossed it is because you have moved and altered that
which is defined as truth.  You by now are having other people question
your position on issues, and I will leave it at that ...
