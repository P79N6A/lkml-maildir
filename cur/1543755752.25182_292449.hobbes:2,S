Sorry, I should have cc'ed you directly but I thought you would
never miss a subject containing $(random scm tool) :)

As Peter said, once every 6 hours is fine. Or even more often, what
the heck, as I said in a previous post I don't think an incremental
export is that much costly. It could be done at the same time as
the -bkX patches...

Why not if there is some interest. As far as I am concerned, I 
have the impression that most kernel BK trees in bkbits.net are
just temporary trees 'Linus please pull from here' type. I don't
know if it's useful for somebody else to track those down.

Speaking from the out-BK point of view, what would really be nice
is better granularity in the CVS export (a 1-1 changeset to CVS commit
mapping). I know this involves playing with CVS branches and could
be a bit tricky but should be doable.
