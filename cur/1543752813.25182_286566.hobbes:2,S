It strange that the instruction set does not contain some simple 64bit
store or load and the FPU state seems to be complex to manage...sigh.
Looked at  arch/i386/lib/mmx.c. It avoids the mmx ops in an interrupt
context but the rest of the prep for mmx only saves the fpu state if its
in use. So that code would only be used rarely. The mmx 64 bit
instructions seem to be quite fast according to the manual. Double the
cycles than the 32 bit instructions on Pentium M (somewhat higher on Pentium 4).
One could simply do a movq.
