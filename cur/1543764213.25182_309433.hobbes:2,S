Have fun!
Ok, here is the first testcase.  It was a real bug, even though never
submitted to Linus:
#define ASM_MACRO	\
	op;		\
#ifdef FOO		\
	op;		\
#else			\
	op;		\
#endif			\
	op;		\
	op;
The thing occurred in some entry.S or head.S, don't remember exactly
which one.  Gcc people might tell you unfriendly things about using
the _C_ preprocessor for _ASM_ code, but that's just how the kernel
code is written.
With gcc 2.95, the old preprocessor errored out on the correct line
and we had a look at the code.  With 3.x, preprocessor chewed things
and starting from "#ifdef", everything was interpreted as a comment
and ignored.
Code never worked and the real bug was papered over by more ugliness,
but stayed that way for a year until someone (me) tried to compile it
with 2.95.
