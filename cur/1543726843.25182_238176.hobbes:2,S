So what does alt-sysrq-t show you about those processes?
How do you reproduce these hangs?  I'm guesssing that
And does 2.6.8-rc (without the MM patch) acts the same.

Odd.  BIOS settings maybe?

The S2R issue is caused by delivering bogus PCI
device power states to PCI drivers.  See if the patch
in 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2886
helps at all.  (It might be better to map STANDBY
to D0 state, so long as nobody's actually checking
PCI config space there to see if D1 or D2 works.)
If you don't actually have code trying to suspend
USB devices, don't enable it.  Until some other
issues in the PM core get resolved (notably its
eagerness to self-deadlock) that's purely for use
by developers.
