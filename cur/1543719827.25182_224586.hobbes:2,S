Yes, I'm quite familiar with what a swapped-out mozilla does to my laptop ;)
The point I was making (apparently poorly) was that if mozilla is swapping in,
*that window* is hosed, but if the WM or the X server is swapping in,
*everything* is hosed.
And I *have* had times when I've left for an extended period while Mozilla
is downloading a Knoppix .iso or similar beastly large thing, and it managed
to keep Mozilla pages hot because it was busy doing a download, and the WM
pages got swapped out because the WM wasn't actually doing anything...
Yes, it's a rare state of affairs, but it *has* happened...
