Subject: PCI IRQ conflict causing X-Windows bug?

Hi, this is in both versions 2.0 and 2.1/2.2.  Recently,if X windows is
loaded immediately on startup it locks up.  Sometimes if I do an SAK
with alt-sysreq-k it recovers and I am able to log in, but I can't
switch back and forth between text mode and graphics mode.
Further, today I noticed that I could move the mouse in X only if I
pressed a key, although the keystrokes went nowhere that I could see. 
That stopped (I think) when I turned off gpm on boot.
Anyway, I noticed that both my video card and Realtek 8029 are list as
having IRQ 12 by both linux and by the motherboard BIOS before boot.  If
I disablemy USB controller, then both are found at IRQ 9.  That is
rather spooky.
? #1
So, does anybody have any idea what might be causing my problem?
? #2
I'm going to assume its related to the irq 'conflict'.  Can I just make
a module and chance the irq, or will that just make the driver look for
the card in the wrong place without actually changing the irq conflict?
Thanks,
-BenRI
