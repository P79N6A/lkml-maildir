IMHO the check is broken:
+               if (((tun->owner != -1 &&
+                     current->euid != tun->owner) ||
+                    (tun->group != -1 &&
+                     current->egid != tun->group)) &&
+                    !capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
                        return -EPERM;
It should be something like:
+               if (!((tun->owner == tun->owner) ||
+                     (tun->group == tun->group) ||
+                     capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN)))
                        return -EPERM;
Please verify and forward to the maintainers if my guess appears to be correct.
