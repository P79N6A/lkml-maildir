Hello:
I have a Sony VAIO PCG-N505VE laptop. It usually gets very hot when I do compiling or something very complex. ACPI says it's at 65 degrees. I have opened it and it has a very little fan near the cpu but it NEVER gets on. I have tested with latests acpi.
under /proc/acpi/fan  there is not any file.
What can I do in order to be useful for the ACPI project to make this work?
Thanks!
