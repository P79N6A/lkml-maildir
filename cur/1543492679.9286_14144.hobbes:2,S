Subject: strange lockups w/2.2.5

I have a PII w/LX chipset, 2 ide hard drives, and an AHA7880 scsi
controller, red hat 5.1 + some updates, and the system was stable
under 2.0.34 but under 2.2.5 it randomly freezes.
Originally I thought this was due to the ne2000 or the SMP mode but I
switched to a tulip and a single-processor kernel and I still get the
lockup; it can happen in either console mode or X, it doesn't even
require a load to happen.
Syslog doesn't have any messages - how can I diagnose this problem?
Thanks,
Mark
