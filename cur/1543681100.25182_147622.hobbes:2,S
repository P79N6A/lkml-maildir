Well....
* you will usually have more reads than writes
* reads are more dependent than writes, on the whole
* writes are larger due to delays and merging
All this is obviously workload dependent, but it seems like the 60% 
common case, at least...
Basically when I hear people talking about lots of writes, that seems to 
be downplaying the fact that seeing 20 writes and 2 reads on a queue 
does not take into account the userspace applications currently 
blocking, waiting to do another read.
