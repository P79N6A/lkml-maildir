Hi,
I will check with the BIOS engineers to see what they have to say... I will 
get back to you very quickly :).  Basically I want to see if they are infact 
putting the tables somewhere > 1GB on a machine where so much RAM is 
available.
If my understanding is correct, their algorithm trie sto put it at the 
highest available RAM.  So say on a machine with 4GB RAM I think we should 
expect to find the MP and ACPI tables close to 4GB.
In any event let me confirm this.
If this is so, I have a fix for this (at least I think so :)
Best Wishes,
Lyle
