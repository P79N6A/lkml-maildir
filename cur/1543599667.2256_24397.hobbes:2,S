First, verify that /dev/null is a character device, major=1, minor=3.
`file /dev/null`.
It may have gotten changed to some real file because of some errors.
In maintenance mode do:
/sbin/mount -n -o remount /dev/hda1 # Mount r/w, no write to /etc/mtab
/bin/rm /dev/null             # Delete it
/bin/mknod /dev/null c 1 3    # Make a new one
/bin/chmod 777 /dev/null      # Accessible by everyone in all modes
/bin/chown root.sys /dev/null # Standard ownership
/sbin/umount /dev/hda1        # Now unmount it
/sbin/mount /proc /proc -t proc # You can mount it if you want
/sbin/e2fsck -f /dev/hda1     # Fix the disk
... After you fix the errors ...
`exec /sbin/init auto`  (or exit if from a startup script)

    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
