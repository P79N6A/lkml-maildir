There was a big discussion about this back in 2002, in which Linus 
wasn't overly enthused about disabling the decode during probing due to 
risk of causing problems with some devices:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2002/12/19/145
In this particular case (64-bit BAR) we might be able to avoid the 
problem by changing the order in which we probe the two halves of the 
address, i.e. change the top half to 0xffffffff before messing with the 
bottom half and then change it back last. That way, we end up mapping it 
way to the top of 64-bit address space, which hopefully is less likely 
to conflict..
