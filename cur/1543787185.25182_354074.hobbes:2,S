Note, this is a property of the debugging session, not a property of
the debuggee.  The debuggee can not say "no possible debugger will ever
be interested in this signal"; it doesn't make sense.

Yes, I entirely understand what you're saying.  I feel like you're not
reading my responses.  GDB _already has a list of signals it does not
care about_.  If ptrace permitted, it could tell the kernel not to
context switch to deliver those signals.  In advance!  That's a
debugger-driven solution to your problem.
I'm not arguing out of theory here.  I've implemented this mechanism
before in other contexts, for instance to prevent the remote protocol
overhead for ignored signals when using gdb with gdbserver.
