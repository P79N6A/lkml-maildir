Not sure what exactly happened here. Was running fsx on ext3 over 2 disk raid0,
and running a yum update. Box locked up solid after a few minutes..

The unwinder getting stuck meant I lost the top of the trace though.
(I have backporting the .19 fixes to .18 on my todo unless someone
 beats me to it and they end up in -stable).
Will try to reproduce with a serial console hooked up.
