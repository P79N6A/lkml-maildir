Well I just saw the opposite ;-) ... A patch I had submitted a few weeks 
ago for Intel 830MP agp support has been intgrated in 2.5.1-pre3, but is 
still not in the 2.4 branch... Several users have reported success with 
this patch, so unless somebody shows storng opposition, I would suggest 
to merge it...
