I haven't been following this discussion that much, but
just FYI: I have seen these messages with both 2.2.0pre kernels
and 2.1.126 (SMC Ultra and 3com Vortex). Go figure. I don't have
any aclue 'bout these since my network connection is hosed anyway, 
tons of errors even with recent net-tools and just lately I had 
cable problem suggestions in the logs.. Pretty insane environment. :)
Some ISPs just suck so royally that it's hard to believe.
