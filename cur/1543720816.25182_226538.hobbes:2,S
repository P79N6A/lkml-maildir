I've experienced this problem too, do you find that the device works almost
perfectly if the data is tranferred in smaller blocks?

I tried to find out some information from iRiver before bug reporting this, I
didn't know whether the bug was specifically with my device. However, I found
the tech support department to be fairly atrocious. 
Now that I know it's not something that's device centred I may try taking a look
at the bug (although I'm not experienced at all in this area of the kernel).
