I don't care so much. The answer should have been a hint that
just some minutes ago, we had a thread on this list about
Solid State Flash disks... it could be interesting to
spend some brain cells in that area - just for an example
...and there are so many.

Propably he doesn't know yet what he wants?

Asking people with more experience what's needed is in my point
of view also a reasonably academic process to make progress in the
right direction. IMHO that's one of the main reasons why
open projects work.
