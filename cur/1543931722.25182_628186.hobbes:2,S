+.LP
+The following ptrace commands provide access to the hardware's last
+branch recording. They may not be available on all architectures.
+.LP
+Last branch recording stores an execution trace of the traced
+process. For every (conditional) control flow change, the source and
+destination address are stored. On some architectures, control flow
+changes inside the kernel are recorded, as well. On later
+architectures, these are automatically filtered out.
+.LP
+The buffer (called Branch Trace Store) can be configured to be either
+circular, or to send a signal to the traced task when it is about to
+overflow. Not all methods may be available on all architectures.
+.LP
+The buffer can be accessed in two ways matching the above
+configurations: either as an array of BTS records from newest
+record to older records, one record at a time; or all records at once,
+from oldest to newest.
+.LP
+The former is mostly used for circular buffers to capture a tail of
+the execution trace (e.g. for debugging); the latter is mostly used to
+collect a continuous trace (e.g. for profiling) where the user drains
+the hardware buffer into a larger private buffer or into a file.
+.LP
+In addition to branches, timestamps (in jiffies) may optionally be
+recorded when the traced process arrives and departs,
+respectively. This information can be used to obtain a qualitative
+execution order, if more than one process is traced.
+.LP
+A BTS record is defined as:
+.LP
+.nf
+enum ptrace_bts_qualifier {
+	PTRACE_BTS_INVALID = 0,
+	PTRACE_BTS_BRANCH,
+	PTRACE_BTS_TASK_ARRIVES,
+	PTRACE_BTS_TASK_DEPARTS
+};
+.sp
+struct ptrace_bts_record {
+	enum ptrace_bts_qualifier qualifier;
+	union {
+		/* PTRACE_BTS_BRANCH */
+		struct {
+			void *from_ip;
+			void *to_ip;
+		} lbr;
+		/* PTRACE_BTS_TASK_ARRIVES or
+		   PTRACE_BTS_TASK_DEPARTS */
+		unsigned long timestamp;
+	} variant;
+};
+.fi
+.LP
+For configuring last branch recording and for querying its status, the
+following struct is used:
+.LP
+.nf
+struct ptrace_bts_config {
+	unsigned long size;
+	unsigned long flags;
+};
+.fi
+.LP

+BTS buffer in bytes.

+.BR PTRACE_BTS_O_SCHED

+.TP
+.BR PTRACE_BTS_O_CUT_SIZE
+Reduce the requested buffer size if it is bigger than the available
+buffer size.
+.RE

+.BR PTRACE_BTS_CONFIG
+Configure last branch recording. \fIaddr\fP points to a
+\fIptrace_bts_config\fP structure (see above).
+(\fIdata\fP is ignored.)
+.TP
+.BR PTRACE_BTS_STATUS
+Writes the actual configuration into a \fIptrace_bts_config\fP
+structure pointed to by \fIaddr\fP. The caller is responsible for
+allocating memory at \fIaddr\fP to hold a \fIptrace_bts_config\fP
+structure.
+(\fIdata\fP is ignored.)
+.TP
+.BR PTRACE_BTS_SIZE
+Returns the number of BTS records available for draining. For a
+circular buffer, this number is meaningless.
+(\fIaddr\fP and \fIdata\fP are ignored.)
+.TP
+.BR PTRACE_BTS_GET
+Reads a single BTS record at index \fIdata\fP into \fIaddr\fP. The
+caller is responsible for allocating memory at \fIaddr\fP to hold one
+\fIptrace_bts_record\fP structure.
+The bigger the index, the older the record; the latest record can
+always be found at index 0.
+.TP
+.BR PTRACE_BTS_CLEAR
+Clears the BTS buffer. This command can be used after a manual
+draining using PTRACE_BTS_GET commands.
+(\fIaddr\fP and \fIdata\fP are ignored.)
+.TP
+.BR PTRACE_BTS_DRAIN
+Reads all available BTS records into the buffer pointed to by
+\fIaddr\fP and clears the buffer. Records are read from oldest to
+newest. Returns the number of BTS records drained. The caller
+is responsible for allocating enough memory to hold an array of
+PTRACE_BTS_SIZE \fIptrace_bts_record\fP structures.
+(\fIdata\fP is ignored.)
