Why can't you have two of them?  Say I'm writing a module to utilize
branch recording to be able to debug a process in reverse (of course
that doesn't really need sched hooks; let's pretend it does).  Why can't
I debug a process that uses kvm?
More importantly, now the two subsystems have to know about each other
so they don't step on each other's toes.

If we make the hooks non-kvm-specific, I'd just add an hlist there.

Even if I eradicate all mention of kvm from the patch, it's still kvm
specific.  kvm at least is sensitive to the exact point where we switch
in (it wants interrupts enabled) and it expects certain parameters to
the callbacks.  If $new_abuser needs other conditions or parameters,
which is quite likely IMO as it will most likely have to do with
hardware, then we will need to update the hooks anyway.
Removing 'kvm' from the patch is easy; but I don't like to pretend to
generality where there ain't.
