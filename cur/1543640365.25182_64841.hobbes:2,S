Some OpenSSH installs must use /dev/random (either an earlier version
than what Oliver quoted or the distribution changed it) because I have
seen headless/diskless machines where they block on ssh session key
generation indefinitely.  I wrote my netdev-random to solve this...
We have seen similar stuff on embedded devices at MontaVista.
