The only one that matters is the one Windows expects.  Which is the
same as what DOS uses.  Which is the geometry from the "legacy INT13"
BIOS interface.

True, multiple disks pose a problem.  But for some applications (e.g.,
mine), the only disk that matters is the boot device.  And although it
is theoretically "impossible" to determine the Linux disk name for the
boot device, somehow this has not prevented millions of installations
of Linux boot loaders.
The vast majority of systems do not have very many drives.  So it is
possible to take a pretty good guess about how they are named.
Also, a fully modern EDD BIOS *will* let you perform this mapping
reliably by giving you PCI bus and device numbers.  The EDD module
exposes this information, provided your BIOS makes it available...
Unfortunately, few do (yet).

I agree that such guessing is better left to userspace.  But I
disagree about applications using HDIO_GETGEO.  By writing to
/proc/ide/hda/settings, I can alter the values returned by HDIO_GETGEO
for IDE devices.  This is exactly what I want to do: Set the geometry
which ALL applications use.
For non-IDE devices, HDIO_GETGEO already returns useful geometry (in
my experience).  So it is a perfectly fine way for applications to
determine the disk geometry.

This is completely useless for my application, which is to install an
OS for the first time.

But I *am* partitioning an empty disk, and I want to use Linux (see
http://unattended.sourceforge.net/
).
And I do.  See:
