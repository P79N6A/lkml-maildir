It seems that you have reached the limit (1MB - 16B) of the kernel size
on i386 that can be currently handled by its internal bootloader.
I don't know if it is possible for lilo/loadlin to handle larger kernels.
The reason is that kernel size is 16bit intereger counting 16 byte chunks.
It is possible to modify it, however it could introduce many problems
with backward compatibility and needs somebody to rewrite bootloaders.
