Fair enough, though I definitely lean towards some use of sysfs / device 
model for AN-style events specifically.  The media change events are 
generated by the device, not the transport, and we should definitely 
have an object in the device model that represents the device (if we 
don't already).
I could see transport-based events being delivered to a different 
endpoint, because transport events differ from device events.
