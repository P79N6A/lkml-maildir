Hello,
I am running RedHat 9 with 2.4.20-8  kernel ;
Now , I have a questo about hotplug:
I have hotplug-2002_04_01-17 installed (rpm);
Now , I read the readme of this rpm ;
in their "installing"  section , clause 5 , it says:
# cp etc/rc.d/init.d/hotplug /etc/rc.d/init.d/hotplug
# cd /etc/rc.d/init.d
# chkconfig --add hotplug
I checked on my machine and there is no "hotplug" file in that folder.
Nevertheless, hotplugin works (because when I plug a USB camera
I can see in the kernel log (/var/log/messages)  messages which start with
/etc/hotplug/usb.agent
I also looked at the kernel code (method "call_polcy" in usb.c )
and it doesn't seems to me that the hotplug in /etc/init.d is needed .
can anybody make some clarifications ?
sting
