I'm not absolutely sure.  I read once that `volatile' accesses and I/O
function calls are the visible side-effects of a C program, which must
be preserved, and the compiler is free to optimise the rest as it
likes.  I think it's a C standard issue.

Look on the bright side.  If you're right, a UP barrier won't change the
code anyway as it's only an instruction ordering barrier, not bus level :-)
