Indeed, your mention of it in that thread.. a year ago?.. is what got  
this notion sitting in the back of my head.  I didn't like it at  
first, but it grew on me.

As for efficiency and overhead, I hope to get some time with the team  
that work on the Giant Database Software Whose Name We Shall Not  
Speak.  That'll give us some non-trival loads to profile.

Yeah, no doubt.  I'm wildly open to discussion here.  (and yeah, me  
either, but I don't care much about the name.  I got tired of  
qualifying overloaded uses of 'stack' or 'thread', that's all :)).

I think we'll also want to flesh out the submission and completion  
interface so that we don't find ourselves frustrated with it in  
another 5 years.  What's there now is just scaffolding to support the  
interesting kernel-internal part.  No doubt the kevent thread will  
come into play here.
