Hi all,
I have an application on x86-64 that will require me sharing two memory
segments upwards of 10+ GB each among several processes. Would it be better
performance-wise to mmap in two files from a tmpfs filesystem, or, create two
large ramdisks (/dev/ram0 & /dev/ram1) and mmap those in?
I'm not concerned about swap, but rather just trying to avoid as much kernel
overhead as possible while accessing gobs of memory.
Thanks,
  -Byron
