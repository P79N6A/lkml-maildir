So it sounds like the most serious problem, the hang,
is not reproducible without the reset of the -mm tree.

Miles,
Please apply the latest acpi patch directly on top of Linus' tree.
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/test/2.6.21/acpi-test-20070126-2.6.21-rc5.diff.gz
If Andrew and I are in sync, you should get the same issues above as above -- no hang,
but still problems 1-4.
Then revert that patch and edit it to delete all changes to ec.c
and apply it again.  ie. keep drivers/acpi/ec.c from Linus's tree and re-test.
If the symptoms 1-4 go away, then we've isolated the regression to the changes to ec.c.
Also, it might be helpful to open up a bug report here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
and attach to it the output from acpidump
thanks,
-Len
