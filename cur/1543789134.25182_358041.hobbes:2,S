ouch! This very much looks like a hardware induced latency, because the 
codepath from those two __schedule points is extremely short and there 
is no loop there. Have you tested this particular box before too? If 
not, can you reproduce this latency with older versions of -rt too on 
the same box, or is this completely new? Occasionally there are boxes 
that show clear signs of hardware latencies - there's little the kernel 
can do about those.
Wild shot in the dark: are there any power-saving modes enabled on the 
box? Another shot in the dark: can you trigger these latencies if the 
networking card is ifconfig down-ed? I.e. perhaps it's related to DMA 
done by the networking device. Playing with BIOS settings / DMA/PCI 
priorities might help reduce DMA related latencies ...
