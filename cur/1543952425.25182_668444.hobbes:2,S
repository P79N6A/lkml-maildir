OK. I see. So, it would have to be some malicious application running together
with the server (i.e. on the same CPU). I do see now why you said it would be
very very hard to make this happen.
Still, it would be nice to introduce SO_REUSEPORT socket options so secure
servers (who happen to be clients as well) can re-use ports when necessary.
Another option would be to check if port re-use is happening inside same
application and allow it. That may make half of the folks happy, so I am not
sure if I like it as much as I like SO_REUSEPORT option.
Thanks,
Neb
