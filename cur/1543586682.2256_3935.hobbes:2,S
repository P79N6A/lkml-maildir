Without the changes listed in this thread, 2.4.3 crashed vmware 2.0.3 
Linux. It did not OOPS the kernel, it caused vmware to go down in
flames....  Changing the code per the previous mail fixed it and
my VM now works fine.  THANKS!
Is this list non-causal?  The answer was posted to the list as I
was getting ready to build 2.4.3 on my VM, before I found the 
problem or even had to ask the question!
Cheers,
