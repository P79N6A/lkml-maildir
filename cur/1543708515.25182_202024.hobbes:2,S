If the hardware is similar, a single driver is OK.
If the hardware is not similar, the preference is for separate drivers.
Shared code in a third module, a "library module", is an acceptable 
solution.  modprobe automatically loads dependent modules, so users 
running "modprobe driver1" or "modprobe driver2" would automatically 
load the shared library module.
