3.2+ would be better than 3.1+
Remember that 3.2 would have been named 3.1.2 if there wasn't the C++
ABI change, and I don't remember any big Linux distribution actually 
using gcc 3.1 as default compiler.
And since gcc 3.2 was released one and a half years before kernel 2.6.0, 
I doubt there's any distribution both supporting kernel 2.6 and not 
shipping any gcc >= 3.2 .
