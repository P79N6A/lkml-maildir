Subject: [2.6 patch] don't allow users to set CONFIG_BROKEN=y
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Do not allow people to create configurations with CONFIG_BROKEN=y.
The sole reason for CONFIG_BROKEN=y would be if you are working on 
fixing a broken driver, but in this case editing the Kconfig file is 
trivial.
Never ever should a user enable CONFIG_BROKEN.
