This cannot be fixed easily and there would be little gain but great
risks. For example, I have a device where reading partition tables can
take up to two seconds. Other devices could be broken and modprobe would
never return. This would effectively freeze the system when it happens in
boot scripts.

This assumption is wrong, even with a completely static /dev.
Common example:
modprobe usb-storage / ppa / whatever
Now, for any reason the kernel is unable to read the partition table.
The script tries to access /dev/sda1 => boom
In fact, udev is even an improvement here. Instead of checking the device
node repeatedly you simply wait for udev to call you. When it does you can
be sure that the device node exists and is valid.

Why not? This is the best way to achieve true and reliable hotplug
support.
