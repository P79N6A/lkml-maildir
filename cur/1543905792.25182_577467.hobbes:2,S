"Wait a bit" could be a very long time.  Who is working on building this
new libata sysfs support now?  If the answer is "no one", which I think it 
may be, do you want to hold up a feature that actually helps many people
for possibly 6 months or more just because we have to go through scsi
right now for our sysfs interface?  on top of that, the last mail I 
got from James on this subject indicated that if we kept our granularity
large with the power savings levels, SCSI can actually take advantage of
this as well.  Sure, we may have to tweak things around later, but isn't
this what we do routinely?  Holding up valuable features from the kernel 
because things aren't perfect yet seems really broken. 
As far as your complaints about broken hardware go, keep in mind that
the patch set does provide a method of adding these disks to a blacklist,
so I don't see that as a problem.  And, the default for this feature is
"off", and user space would have to explicitly enable it.
