Look, now you still don't have a PCI interrupt, but magically the ISA
interrupts _do_ show up.

Strange. The ISA interrupts should show up regardless of whether a CardBus
or 16-bit PCMCIA card is inserted. 
I wonder if it matters which card you had at bootup? Ie boot up with the
16-bit card, and then switch to the 32-bit one..
