I thought one of the advantages here was that a userspace program could give 
hints about whether the scheduler should optimize it for latency or for 
throughput, without having to be root.
XFree86 and Konqueror Xterm and Kmail could all say "latency in me is end-user 
visible, so I care more about latency than throughput".  And stuff like the 
nightly cron job that exists just to screw up my desktop because I AM awake 
at 4 am a noticeable percentage of the time...  Anyway, it cares about 
throughput and not at all about latency.  Same with just about any invocation 
of gcc, so they'd never set the flags.
If Bash really wanted to get fancy, it could set the flag depending on whether 
the process on the other end of its input PTY had the flag or not, but let's 
worry about that later... :)

Uh-huh.
So with SCHED_SOFTRR, if the system gets heavily loaded enough later on then 
the SOFTRR tasks can get demoted and start skipping.  So we're back to having 
a system where cron had better not start up while you're mixing sound because 
it might put you over the edge.
I fail to see how this is an improvement on Con's "carpet bomb the problem 
with heuristics out the wazoo" approach?  (I like heuristcs.  They're like 
Duct Tape.  I like Duct Tape.)
