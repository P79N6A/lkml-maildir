Subject: kernel behaviour at media-changed

Yesterday after 1 hour (or so) of non disk activity my mounted Iomega Zip
250 turned into a power-safe state. A few hours later I typed "umout
/zip". Mount complained with "/zip: device is busy". But I overread
this... 
After replaceing the Zip (yes! normally the Zip is locked, but the
zip-drive forgot this during power-safe...) I tryed to mount the new Zip,
wich gave me something like: "/dev/sda1 already mounted or /zip busy"
Yet I noticed that umount had not umounted correctly... But the zip's ext2
was corrupted already ;-(!
My question: What about throwing all cache-data away and auto-umount,
             in the case the kernel gets a media-change at device-xy and
             this device-xy is mounted??
Best wishes
Rene
