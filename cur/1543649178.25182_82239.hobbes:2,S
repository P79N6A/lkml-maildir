	Adrian,
	Thanks very much for the report. I personally uses modules,
and I would prefer the ability to compile both modules, so that people
can try both without having to recompile their kernel.
	I think a much better patch (and simpler in the long term)
would be to just rename 'toshoboe_init' to 'donauboe_init' (plus the
few other offending function). This is a case where the name doesn't
really matter.
	What do you think ?
	Jean
