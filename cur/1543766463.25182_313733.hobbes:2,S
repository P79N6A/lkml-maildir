Thanks fo your response, 
I use NOR flash . I am testing the system using LTP test case . Flash
Image is not prepared by me . I simply mount jffs2 on to a mount point
and test for jffs2 . But the behaviour is seen that if I give mount
point as /tmp and not any other directory I get abnormal behaviour like:
1.following log seen
[root@Linux tmp]$ waiting for chip to be ready timed out in word write
Write error in obliterating obsoleted node at 0x0011c570: -5
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address

pgd = c3d08000

Internal error: Oops: 807 [#1].........................................
3.)  mount after this I  get 
root@Linux /]$ mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock0 /tmp
jffs2_scan_eraseblock(): Magic bitmask 0x1985 not found at 0x002a82a0:

Please, post your warning. Post them better to the MTD list.
Before posting please explore carefully the

 Web site.
Which flash do you use? How did you prepare your JFFS2 image?
