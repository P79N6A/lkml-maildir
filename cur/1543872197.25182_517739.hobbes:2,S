In general, don't even *try* to use radeonfb for suspend/resume.
I don't think it has ever worked, except on some very rare laptops 
(largely PPC Macs) where people had enough information to set up the 
PLL's.
I don't think the other framebuffer drivers are much better.
You're better off using the VGA console, and lettign X re-initialize the 
graphics device. That generally at least has a reasonably good chance of 
working.
Re-initializing graphics modes really is very hard. You can try with the 
BIOS video hack (I forget the kernel command line to turn it on), but we 
really do end up depending on X doing it better.
Some day we may have modesetting support in the kernel for some graphics 
hw, right now it's pretty damn spotty.
