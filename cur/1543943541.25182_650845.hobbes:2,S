Where was it previously always BCD ?
The code flow is taken 1:1 from the original x8664 code. Just the
BCD_TO_BIN code has been made conditional for i386, which is not
chanining the logic at all, because RTC_ALWAYS_BCD is always true on
x8664.
While your change does not do any harm due to BCD_TO_BIN(0) = 0, it
is just not fixing anything.
Thanks,
