You can only open files >= 2GB if you pass the O_LARGEFILE flag
to open(2). Otherwise open() will simply fail. As legacy apps do
not set O_LARGEFILE, there is no problem.
If you do open a file >= 2GB with O_LARGEFILE but then use stat()
instead of stat64(), the results are probably not defined. And
the kernel may choose to exec /usr/local/bin/nethack at that point.
