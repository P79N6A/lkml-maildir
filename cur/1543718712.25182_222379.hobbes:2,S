Subject: [PATCH] ppc64: Fix possible race with set_pte on a present PTE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

(RESENT)
There is a subtle race which can cause set_pte to be called on ppc64 on
a PTE that is already present (that normally doesn't happen for us) and
which itself, in the proper race condition, can trigger a duplicate hash
entry to be added to the hash table (very bad).
This fixes it by making sure we trigger the actual flush of the batch
whenever set_pte is called on a present PTE, before putting the new PTE
in.
