I admit, I might have missed the latest version of your patch, but in what I 
have seen, some functionality have been missing comparing to my patch                 
(do you have a possibility to compile a kernel especially for NexGen, 
Transmeta or UMC?), and it also changes user experience, which obviously 
should not happen in the stable branch. However, it might be a good idea to 
work on your patch for v 2.7.
Anyway, if you would like, I can separate CPU support part of the patch from 
the other parts...
