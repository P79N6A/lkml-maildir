i can't believe that the stable series of kernels used for desktop
workstations and production servers would be as pathological.  sure,
device driver work etc. can lead to potential destructiveness... but
developers understand that risk.
how hard can it be to provide a small area of memory that is
hardware-protected from the kernel to allow safe interactive debugging or
oops processing?  how does the RTLinux kernel protect itself from the
standard Linux kernel?
