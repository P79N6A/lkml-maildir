Here's what pcmcia (the kernel one) says when booting 2.3.31.
Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.4
  kernel build: 2.3.31 #1 Thu Dec 9 08:52:31 EST 1999
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [apm]
Intel PCIC probe:
  Omega Micro 82C092G PCI-to-PCMCIA at bus 0 slot 3, port 0x3e0, 2 sockets
    host opts [0]: none
    host opts [1]: none
    ISA irqs (scanned) = 3,4,5,7 polling interval = 1000 ms
lspci:
00:03.0 PCMCIA bridge: Omega Micro Inc. 82C092G (rev 02)
        Flags: slow devsel, IRQ 9
        I/O ports at 03e0 [size=4]
When booting (I put pcmcia in kernel to keep from having fsck's later)
2.3.99pre2 (this happened in 2.3.50 as well I believe), I see something
like:
Intel PCIC probe:
  <I forget what it says> ISA-to-PCMCIA ...  port 0x3e0
I looked, theres no mention of omega anywhere in drivers/pcmcia
