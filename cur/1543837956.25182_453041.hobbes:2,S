Ahhh, but there are two allocators in play here.
The first one allocates the memory for receiving packets.
This can be one pool, as long as it is isolated from
other things in the system it is fine.
The second allocator allocates more memory for socket
buffers.  The memory critical sockets should get their
memory from a mempool, once normal socket memory
allocations start failing.
This means our allocation differentiation only needs
to happen at the socket stage.
Or am I overlooking something?
