It shouldn't find /dev/hde ... /dev/hdj (there's some problem with the
detection mechanism), as these are I2O devices, and thus it's
/dev/i2o/hd?. You have to stop the discovery process by adding 
hde=noprobe hdf=noprobe hdg=noprobe hdh=noprobe hdi=noprobe hdj=noprobe
to the lilo append variable.
BTW, I'm using 2.4.20-pre10-ac1 and it runs rock solid (despite some
1-10s stalls that seem to be controller related).
