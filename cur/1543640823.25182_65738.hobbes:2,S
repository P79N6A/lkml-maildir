 Please look at my reply to Ben LeHaise which has the cycles for
 alloc_skb() and __kfree_skb(). You don't have to guess that.

That was initial results which had more than the posted patch. We are
still working on getting numbers.

Are you basing this 0.35% degradation on your profile. According to
Dave's SPECweb99 results there is a 2.97% improvement in simultaneous
