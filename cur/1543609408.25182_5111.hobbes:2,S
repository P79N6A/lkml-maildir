   I'm just guessing: the scheduler isn't yet functional when
   spawn_ksoftirqd is called.
The scheduler is fully functional, this isn't what is going wrong.
Look at my other email from last night.  At this point in the booting
process, what would we possibly switch to if ksoftirqd is in running
state constantly?  No other kernel thread is of a higher priority if
the only things running are the idle threads and ksoftird.  This is
basically what I think is happening on sparc32.
Right?
Franks a lot,
