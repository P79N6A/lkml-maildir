Hm, that doesn't work right now.  Both:
  git fetch rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/chrisw/linux-2.6.12.y.git tag v2.6.12.1
or
  git fetch tag rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/chrisw/linux-2.6.12.y.git v2.6.12.1
die.  Or am I just trying to take a point you were making about not
pulling all tags (which I can live with, just was not aware it was this
way, and I agree that it does offer up a lot of possiblities of me using
local tags in the future), and taking it literally?
thanks,
