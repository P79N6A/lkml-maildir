Yup, did both on all drivers/hid/*.c and drivers/usb/input/hid*.c
recompiled and reloaded all modules (hid.ko, usbhid.ko and joydev.ko)
But it's pathetic the fact that ubuntu's kernel have an option
USB_DEBUG and on Makefile is says "if USB_DEBUG; aditional_opt=
-DDEBUG" but inside the files all DEBUG flags are hardcoded undefined.
Also, to turn on KERN_DEBUG messages I saw on kernel hacking webpages:
$ echo 15 15 15 15 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
$ echo 8 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
I did it and monitored mesasges and syslog and both shows the same
data... I guess that dump after mouse detection is DEBUG_DATA in
place.
