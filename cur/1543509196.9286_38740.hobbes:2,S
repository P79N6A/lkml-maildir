How does windows find these infos? Normally it doesn't even look for it. I
have yet to see a Windows fresh install that does _not_ come up in
640x480x16.
Is there someone working on "Monitor PnP" (DDC?) or something?, that would
probably be the way to go. Steal infos from Windows is not bad, but not
everybody has Windows.

Yes. What would be very nice would be a cddb-like hwdb for hardware tuning,
which could be duplicated on a distribution and used for installation. When
the user then changes his settings and inputs new ones, he is asked if he
wants to upload those new settings.
Just for video, sound, monitor, printer settings. All those settings that
are hard, if not impossible, to auto detect, because you don't know what
the user wants.
Nice idea. Anyone? :)
