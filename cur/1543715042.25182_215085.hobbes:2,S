Sorry that was not what I meant. I meant that the 2.4.26 irq routing or
I don't know what might experience difficulties due to the presence of
a PCI bridge on this board, and potentially this one particularly. I once
encountered such a problem in a desktop machine which would only see 3 out
of the 4 ports on an adaptec quad board, depending on the PCI slot it was
fit in ! It turned out to be a problem with region alignment or something
like this which was not correctly forwarded through the bridge (bios bug
or so at initialization).

OK, same here.

I remember something like this not long ago. It was what ethtool reported, but
the card was running either gigabit or a forced 100FDX without auto-neg on the
other side, I don't remember. Can you try a simple 4-pairs cable between two
ports on the quad to check what media is negociated ?
Also, can you cat /proc/interrupts with and without io/apic, and try without
ACPI as Zwane suggested ?
Cheers,
Willy
