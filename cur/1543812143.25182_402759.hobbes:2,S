I'd prefer adding that wait queue in the iommu code, it's where it
belongs. Didn't we agree on just a global waitqueue? The the interface
for block/net/whatever-consume would just be something like:
        iommu_wait();
which would return when we have enough space, hopefully. A subsystem
specific waitqueue would have the handy side of supplying a callback on
the wake up, which would be a nicer design. But isn't the enough
wait_for_resources() call sufficient for this?
