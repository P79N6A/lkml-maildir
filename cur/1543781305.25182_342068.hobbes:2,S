Yes. You should see 
	Bisecting: xxx revisions left to test after this
and the "xxx" should hopefully decrease by half during each round. And t 
the end of it, you should get
	<sha1> is first bad commit
followed by the actual patch that caused the problem.

You'd have to use the raw commit names, since these things don't have any 
symbolic names. You can get that by just doing
	cat .git/HEAD
which will give you a 40-character hex string (representing the 160-bit 
SHA1 of the top commit). Not very readable, but it's unique, and if you 
report that hex string to other git users, they can trivially recreate the 
tree you have.

If you remember/save the good/bad commit ID's, you can restart the whole
process and just feed the correct state for the ID's:
	git bisect start
	git bisect bad v2.6.13-rc5
	git bisect good v2.6.13-rc4
	.. here bisect will start narrowing things down ..
	git bisect bad <sha1 of known bad>
	git bisect good <sha1 of known good>
	..
ie you can always feed an arbitrary number of known good/bad points by
naming them by their SHA1 ID (or their symbolic name, as in the
v2.6.13-rcX releases).
