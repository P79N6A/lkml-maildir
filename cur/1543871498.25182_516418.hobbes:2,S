1 sane ABI instead of 4 parallel ones? It's the same difference as the 
difference between 300 system calls and 1200 system calls. Alot more 
focus, alot more integration, alot less pain. Every time i change a 
detail in Linux i have to update (and think about) 1 virtualization 
aspect - not 4 (or more).
