Would moving export_iget into fs/inode.c & exporting it from there be a 
reasonable way to go?  At least ext2 & ext3 both have this need (prevent 
nfs access to special inodes) so putting the bulk of what they need for 
get_dentry (i.e. export_iget) somewhere common seems like a decent 
option to me.
