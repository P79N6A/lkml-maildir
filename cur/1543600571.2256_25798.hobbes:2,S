For reference, I am using 2.4.9-ac9 + ext3-0.9.9 + dir_speedup +
kpreempt with no problem.  I have my root mounted as ext3, type ordered,
with a local journal.
I don't have any data points on performance gains, but I would be happy
to provide any if you specify what.  Everything feels good.
I see no reason not to merge this into Alan's tree.  At least
ext3-0.9.9, but the directory speedup seems reasonable enough too.
