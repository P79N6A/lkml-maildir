	So when I say that the daemon would start killing processes
when it gets a message from the kernel that 90% of VM is in use,
it can't run because that 10% of VM that isn't in use doesn't exist?
	Color me confused. The daemon runs BEFORE an OOM, but in NEAR
OOM conditions - ie. only 10% of VM left, or 5M of VM, or whatever the
user set the limit to be.
	The killing STARTS at 10% of VM remaining. Kind of like when
filesystems reach the root-only reserve point (an old BSDism, I know...)
and only root can create new files...
