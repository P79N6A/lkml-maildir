Subject: GPL violation by CorAccess?

Hello
I have seen a device by CorAccess which apparently uses Linux and didn't find
anything that would suggest it complies to GPL, though I had access to the
complete shipping package. Does anyone know about known cause of violation by
this company or should I investigate further?
