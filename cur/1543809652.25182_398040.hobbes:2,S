Well, another approach would be to create a new context which has
visibility over the other container as well as the ability to send
signals to it.

I don't like this term "single global pid space".  Two containers might
be able to see all processes on the system, one might have a flat
mapping to all PIDs < 64k (or pid_max), one with the XID,PID encoded
bitwise.  They are both global pid spaces, but there is no "single" one,
unless that is all you compile in.
