A long time ago I took some work Paul Mundt did and used to build a
working driver for the Sega Dreamcast Visual Memory Unit flash memory.
I am now trying to revive that for 2.6 kernels.
In the past the flash was simply described as MTD_OTHER - but I see from:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/13/151
that type was axed as it was thought unused (not unreasonable - my &
Paul's driver resided in the Dreamcast Linux CVS, not anywhere near
mainline).
I am loathe to just post a patch adding it back, so does it make any
difference if I use another type (I really have no idea of what the
physical type used in the Dreamcast is, though possibly someone here
might?)
