I'd agree.  O_DIRECT means data will go direct to backing store, so if
RAM *is* the backing store as in the tmpfs case, then I see why
O_DIRECT should fail for it...
I often use tmpfs when I want to test new setups - it's easy to get
rid of again and it's fast during testing. Why shouldn't I be able to
test apps that use O_DIRECT this way?
