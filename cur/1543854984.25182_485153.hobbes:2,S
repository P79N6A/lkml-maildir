Send patches inline. Or if you and only have access to a MUA which
reformats inline text but have an urgent patch, send as attachment in
7bit ASCII encoding, typed as text/plain or text/x-patch.
All the patches you sent were encoded in base64 and typed as
application/octet-stream, thus totally useless on a mailinglist.
