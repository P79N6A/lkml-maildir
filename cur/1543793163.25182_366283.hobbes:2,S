Subject: drivers/video/nvidia/ compile error with PPC_OF=y, FB_OF=n

I got the following compile error in 2.6.14-mm2 that seems to come from 
Linus' tree:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC [M]  drivers/video/nvidia/nv_of.o
drivers/video/nvidia/nv_of.c:33: error: redefinition of 'nvidia_probe_of_connector'
drivers/video/nvidia/nv_proto.h:51: error: previous definition of 'nvidia_probe_of_connector' was here
make[3]: *** [drivers/video/nvidia/nv_of.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
The problem is that nv_proto.h thinks nv_of.o is only built with 
CONFIG_FB_OF=y, but it's actually built when CONFIG_PPC_OF=y.
