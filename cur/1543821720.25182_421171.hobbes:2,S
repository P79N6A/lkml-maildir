Hello people.
I am trying to take data timestamp from an icmp sk_buff, the icmphdr don´t 
have this information.  I feel that timestamp information could be in data 
sk_buff. How take this information?? Is it wrong?
struct tstamp{
      __u32 times[3];
} ;
{
    struct tstamp *tstamp;
    tstamp = (struct tstamp *)(skb->data + skb->hh.iph->ihl * 4 + 
sizeof(struct icmphdr));
}
If it is ok, why can´t i take the data timestamp?
THANKS  for any help.
