I have a copy -- they sent one to me readily back when it was new --
but it's not open source, so I can't share it.
It's not a huge program; the whole thing is 5000 lines of C.
It uses the rtsignal method of readiness notification.
IMHO anyone writing a similar user-space server these days should start 
with a clean encapsulation of the readiness notification code, e.g. 
http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/doc/Poller.html
 .
The performance would be similar, the code would be
a lot cleaner, and it'd be a heck of a lot more portable.

Point taken.  One of my friends uses khttpd in production, too.
Somebody needs to come up with a nice GPL'd userspace replacement
for khttpd.  (Or does one already exist?  I haven't been following things
too closely...)
