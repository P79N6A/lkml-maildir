Because there are two distinct and separate models of port mapping/usage:
1) A bunch of separate IO address spaces (PIO).  The "mapping" is 
currently done in ata_pci_init_native_mode() and ata_pci_init_legacy_mode()
2) One single linear address space (MMIO).  The mapping is done in the 
low-level driver.
#1 is in the library because the logic is duplicated _precisely_, across 
multiple host controllers, according to a hardware specification.
Thus, if the mapping is done in the library core, so should the unmapping.
