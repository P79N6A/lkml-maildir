Hello;
I have compiled the results for tiobench with Anticipatory Scheduler for
before and after the addition of the readahead-revert-lazy-readahead patch
in the 2.6.1-mm4 kernel.   I have found our SCSI systems showed up to 50%
improvement in Sequential Reads on ext2.  (2-CPU/MegaRAID/RAID0/5disks and
4-CPU/AACRAID/RAID0/5disks).  Here are the plots:

Oddly, random reads also show slight improvement:

Our 2CPU/MegaRAID particularly has been underperforming in the past, but
now is much more comparable to 'deadline'.  Here are plots of the current
-mm and mailine kernels:
