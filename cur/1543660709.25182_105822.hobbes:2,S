I am well aware of the documentation in Documentation/kbuild and know
that kbuild is flexible enough to support customized CFLAGS. I didn't
argue that.

I can't follow your hostility in this matter; I didn't "come crying"
to you when things broke in the past and I'm not crying now. Last time
I checked, voicing concerns was a legitimate thing to do.
The "broken and short-term solutions" are needed with any kernel that
doesn't provide the module building support introduced with Linux 2.5,
which will likely be the majority of kernels in use for quite a while,
still.
