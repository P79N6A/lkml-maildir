GIT 0.99.8f is available as usual at:
    RPMs and tarball: www.kernel.org:/pub/software/scm/git/
    Debs and tarball: www.kernel.org:/pub/software/scm/git/debian/
Sorry, I said 0.99.8e was going to be the last 0.99.8
maintenance release, but it turns out that there was a flurry of
updates to git-daemon and rev-list (which matters to gitweb)
yesterday.  So here it is.
Now, this _is_ going to be the last 0.99.8 maintenance release,
I promise ;-).
