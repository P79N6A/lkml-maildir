hi *
as mentioned with 2.0.36 -- the colors in the make menuconfig stuff are
almost unreadable. the backfround color of the items are dark blue and only
are readable when the selection bar is on top.
It also happened with 2.0.36; 2.0.35 didn't have this behaviour. 
anyone who has an idea why this happens ?
(in the mean time, I'll put 2.0.35 back on the source tree and recheck that
it is working OK)
