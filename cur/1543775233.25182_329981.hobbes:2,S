Uh, yeah.  I thought we already discussed this in the last flamewar
about merging Reiser4.  You can patch tar/cp/backup programs if you want
to go the file-as-dir route, or you can try to patch all the other
programs if you want to go the xattr route and you really want to edit
you extended attributes using $EDITOR (which I'll admit not everyone
wants to do).

Only filesystems that support the capability, or if you have an
appropriate filename munging system (see below) or some other system to
emulate the capability.

Scores, no.  But Tetris still may have resource data that logically
belongs to it.  Like icons, internationalization data, UI data
(say a Glade file), etc.  It's all part of the same package; it would be
nice (IMHO) if it was grouped together in the filesystem.
I don't think MacOS X stores scores in the app file, but they have a lot
of other stuff in there -- stuff that I mentioned in the previous
paragraph.

If there's no binary data attached to /home or /etc (i.e. it only has
directory contents), then nothing happens (other than an error
message).  That's like asking what happens if I do
"cat nonexistent.file".  If there's no data there to work with, then
nothing happens.

What happens when you copy a file from NTFS that has multiple streams?
Or a file that has extended attributes onto a filesystem that doesn't
support xattr?

If you really want to, you can do some filename munging.  The contents
of the /usr/games/tetris/ directory could be put in /usr/games/...tetris,
or something like that.

It's really, really ugly. ;-)
It's possible to just put all my files all in a single directory.  But
sorting things into different directories makes things look much nicer.

Files would have two "forks" (can't think of any better terminology
right now).  A data fork, and a directory fork.
--- Begin useless analogy ---
Sort of like a real folder in meatspace.  I can talk about what I've
written on the folder (because I can write stuff on real physical
folders), or I can talk about what's inside the folder.
Or if I have a document, I can talk about the document itself, or the
random post-its, notes, and paperclips that I have attached to it.
---- End useless analogy ----
Right now, most Linux filesystems have xattrs and acls (stored as
xattrs).  Maybe in the future, the Samba people will get support for
multiple streams.  If I want to copy my NTFS file to ext3 and preserve
the multiple streams, then ext3 will need to support multiple streams
now.  Now we have two strange things inside.  Why not just unify the
interface using something like file-as-dir, or metafs that was proposed
in this thread, or openat, or something like that?

Not rewritten; patched.  And not all programs.  Actually, most programs
would work just fine.  The Namesys people can tell you how many programs
didn't work properly when they tried out the metas directory, and how
much patching was required to get them to work properly again.  (Not
counting tar/cp/backup programs.  Everyone already knows about the
problems there.)

xattr is being added to most filesystems in Linux.  It doesn't work
everywhere, in all operating systems.  Programs will have to be patched
to work with it.  Does that mean that xattr is a bad idea?

How do you handle it now when everyone wants different information on a
song?
I don't really see what the problem is here.
Note: I'm not saying that keeping everyone's pet metadata with shared
files is a good idea.  This is your example.  The local library doesn't
allow me to make random annotations to their books, but I can do
whatever I want with my own books.

If I email a picture that I took to a friend, I don't send them the
whole 6 megapixel picture in RAW format.  I convert to JPEG and scale it
down.  If I email a music file that has the lyrics translated into
swahili, I can strip that bit out.  Nobody's forcing you to keep
everything.

You do whatever you want to do with your data.  If you want to keep the
pet iguana's metadata, go ahead.

So what do you do right now when you want to do something like that?
File-as-dir (or the other proposals) won't prevent you from doing that.
It just allows you more options.
