Additionnally to CODA (that I really should look into some day ...),
there is:
   - userfs: real (slow, but allows easy code prototyping) user-space
             filesystems
   - FIST: (portable) stackable filesystem, however in kernel mode.
   - podfuk (haven't looked into this one yet)
   - the perl interface InterMezzo uses (
http://www.InterMezzo.org
 or
     something like this)
