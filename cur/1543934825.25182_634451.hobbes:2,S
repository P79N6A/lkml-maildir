Isn't it a timing problem?
I mean, I guess that codying style fixes are OK if there is a good coordination
with the maintainer and patches are sent with the right timing in
order to not cause
problems in the process.
Do you agree?
May be, similar as you suggested, next time people should ask on the list
and fixing the codying style issues on the files suggested by the relevant
maintainers?
