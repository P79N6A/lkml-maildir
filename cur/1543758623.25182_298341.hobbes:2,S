Well, I show you the updated source code and strace output and if you still 
don't believe me, ask me for a login to our system ;)
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        char *dir;
        struct stat *buf;
        int err;
        dir = argv[1];
        buf = malloc(sizeof(struct stat));
        errno = 0;
        err = stat(dir, buf);
        if ( err ) {
                fprintf(stderr, "err = %i\n", err);
                fprintf(stderr, "stat for %s failed \n", dir);
                fprintf(stderr, "ernno: %i (%s)\n", errno, strerror(errno));
        } else
                fprintf(stderr, "stat() works fine.\n");
        return (0);
}

See above.

You certainly know much better than me, but I think strace shows that its 
calling stat64.

I have to admit that knfsd-mount moints are not affected, but on the other 
hand, I really cant't see anything in the ethereal captures. If someone 
should be interested, I have uploaded them:
