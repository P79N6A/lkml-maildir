Yes, and ... ?  Initialization and assignment are entirely different
animals in C++.  Anyone who doesn't know that isn't ready to _read_
C++ code, much less write it.

Exaggeration.  Tsk.

That's a feature, not a bug.  C++'s object model is limited to
features that have efficient implementation and which penalize only
those who use them.

You are mistaken.  Standard C++ features allow just such
transmogrification.  I should know -- it's a key part of the
implementation of (what might become) Perl 6.  Example:
    Base *target = new Derived1;
    // begin transmogrification
    void *p = dynamic_cast<void *>(target);
    target->~Base();
    target = new (p) Derived2;
    // end transmogrification
Tadaa, all done.  Only requirement is that the new class be no larger
than the old one -- same as C.  :-)

C++ is a tool, not a sculpture.  Read "The Design and Evolution of C++"
if you don't like this.  Stroustrup is eloquent and, I believe, right.
