I searched around for printk references and am guessing that this is the
method by which a piece of code prints errors to the terminal in which it is
running (total guess here, sorry if it is totally off base).  If that is the
case, it is something (PPP's slhc_toss (see next paragraph)???) which is
running in every tty, as it prints out on every tty.
OK, so from what you are telling me ( I do not write code, so another total
guess here), if I look at the following, I will assume that it is a problem
with the slhc_toss function, which is related to the modem, which is on the
USB.  Since it only appears to give this message when I am transferring data,
this makes me think that this is somewhat correct.  So I hope that I was
close?  Thanks for the reply.
