NO.  Don't remove the functionality that is required.  Fix your
userspace applications to behave correctly.  If _you_ require your
userspace applications to not clear counters, then fix the application.
The counters are not gospel.  The modules are not omnipresent.
Time and again, people beg and plead the kernel developers to change
the kernel to suit their personal biases and applications.  Historically
they have been vehemently against it.  Of what purpose does breaking EVERY
application out there by performing this kernel mod have?
As Matti Aarnio points out, this is nearly beaten to death.  Since none
of the 'Big Boys' have commented, my guess is that this is a moot argument,
and no changes to the kernel will take place.
