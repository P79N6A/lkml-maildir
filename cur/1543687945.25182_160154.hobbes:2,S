Alternatively, you could leave the platform model as is (it's only
for really dumb devices).  On PPC, we have an OCP (on chip peripheral)
model that is mostly integrated into the device model now.  OCP is
just another bus/driver type and so PM works in the normal fashion.
There's a driver API around it as well so we can cleanly share drivers
across various SoC implementations with different base address,
IRQ mappings, etc.  It might be more useful to extende this across
the architectures that need it.
