Fair enough. Given the similarity between the gcc initializer syntax
and the C labelled statement syntax, I don't think the Perl script
would look simple if I had to write it. But many people are better
Perl coders than I.

I agree that the macro approach is ugly, it just seems wiser to think
these things through before we have lots of designated initializers in
the kernel, rather than after, and it wasn't clear from your messages
that you had considered this issue.

Yup, generally I'm in favour of the patch.
