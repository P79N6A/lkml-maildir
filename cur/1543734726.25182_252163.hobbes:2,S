Upon upgrading to the latest bk release, the speakers on my PowerBook
have become little more than whispering devices.
Is there a way we can make that new Dynamic Range Compression code both
(1) keep the speakers from blowing out (the purpose of the code IIRC),
and (2) let me actually hear the music?
