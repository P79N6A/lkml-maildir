Behind a barrier is not on a medium customarily used for software
interchange, which 3a requires.

On a CD is a preferred form for making modifications to it. You are assuming
"it" means one particular copy of the source code when in fact "it" means
the source code.

It makes no difference who imposes the restriction. Read section 7
carefully. If *anything* imposes restrictions on the recipient's exercise of
their GPL rights, you can't distribute.

Because you have no way to get that software to run on my desktop, just as
you have no way to get that software to run on your Tivo.

This is pretty clear that no copy is special. In any event, this is a grant
of license, not a guarantee of ability. (Read the context.)

No, read section 7. The GPL does not just prevent you from imposing further
restrictions, it also prohibits you from distrbuting if *anything* imposes
such restrictions. Otherwise, you could get around the GPL just by having
someone else impose restrictions.

You are now directly contradicting yourself. We agreed that if anything
prevented your recipients from exercising your GPL rights, that means you
cannot distribute. How you are saying so long as you don't stop them, you
can distribute. In fact, the former view is correct and the latter is wrong,
as GPL section 7 makes clear.
If the right/ability to modify a particular copy is a GPL right, then you
cannot distribute on CDROM.

You are confusing a grant of license with an assurance of ability. Section 2
is a grant of permission.
If we were to read "may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion
of it" the way you suggest, that would mean that you must be able to modify
every single copy of the program that is distributed to you. This would make
distribution on CDROM a GPL violation, which you agree it isn't. So this
must be a grant of permission, rather than an assurance of ability.

I am, and you are.
