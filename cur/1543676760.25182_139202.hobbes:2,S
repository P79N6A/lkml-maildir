"broken" is a very polite way to describe that driver.  Starting with the
idea of mkdir in virtual filesystem (procfs or otherwise) creating and
populating a diretory (unmodifiable, BTW) and rmdir - removing it, even
though it's non-empty (and can't be emptied, due to above).
Guys, that's _sick_.  And that's aside of the shitload of races all over
that code (no locking whatsoever).  And kmalloc(..., GFP_KERNEL) with
interrupts disabled.  And shutting the hardware down before unregistering
netdev (yes, you check that it's down; nothing guarantees that it will
stay down while you do ->hw_exit() and friends).  And so on, and so on...
IOW, driver needs a serious rewrite, starting with its API.
