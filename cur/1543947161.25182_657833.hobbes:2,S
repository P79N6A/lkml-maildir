I got quite a few positive responses from end-users about CPU isolation extensions that I posted awhile ago.
For people who are interested in using latest CPU isolation stuff on top of the stable 2.6.24.y tree I created 
a separate GIT tree that is available at
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/maxk/cpuisol-2.6.24.y.git
It's currently based on the 2.6.24.2 released by the stable team. I'll be pulling latest stable updates into
it as they become available.
