I agree.

parisc seems to, but sparc uses its own open coded spinlock for bitops, and
the array of regular spinlocks for atomic ops. OTOH, consolidating them
might give more scalable code *and* a smaller cacheline footprint?

AFAIK no architecture does anything special, so maybe a generic converter
would be best, until one comes along that does. (the only thing of note
really is that half of the atomics use volatile types and half don't, is
that a problem?).
