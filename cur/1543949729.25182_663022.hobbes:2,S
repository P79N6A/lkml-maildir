If we apply this, can it be broken down into several smaller patches?
I am in the midst of a large overhaul of the tuning subsystem, and if
this all gets applied at once, it will wreck havoc on my pending
changesets.
Other than that, I'm fine with this change if that's what we're doing
across the rest of the kernel...  Would just be easier to deal with if
it could be further broken down by subdirectory.
