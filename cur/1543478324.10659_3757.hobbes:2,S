OK.
To avoid this, one could reserve the directory slot originally
used to open the file until the file is closed. Subsequent calls
to open can return the original inode number, no matter what the
current on-disk value is.

The NFS solution is better, and it keeps the same inode number.
It also reduces the time during which a crash would leave lost
clusters in the FAT.
I note that Linux does not currently support the dirty flag:
Field               Offset     Length
Physical Drive Number  36         1
Current Head           37         1    <--- now a dirty flag
Signature              38         1
ID                     39         4
Volume Label           43        11
System ID              54         8
The low order bit is a dirty flag, used to indicate that autochk
should run chkdsk against the volume at boot time.
The second lowest bit is a flag indicating that a surface scan
should also be run.
(this is NT 4... I believe Win9x uses the other 6 bits to choose
what FAT is active)
