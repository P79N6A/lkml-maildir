I tested this further and it turned out that the Linus tree is also
affected. So I ran git-bisect, after I found out that version
2.6.21.6 was not affected by this bug.
This is the result:
gentoox2 linux # git bisect bad
1c710c896eb461895d3c399e15bb5f20b39c9073 is first bad commit
commit 1c710c896eb461895d3c399e15bb5f20b39c9073

    utimensat implementation
    Implement utimensat(2) which is an extension to futimesat(2) in that it
    a) supports nano-second resolution for the timestamps
    b) allows to selectively ignore the atime/mtime value
    c) allows to selectively use the current time for either atime or mtime
    d) supports changing the atime/mtime of a symlink itself along the lines
       of the BSD lutimes(3) functions
    For this change the internally used do_utimes() functions was changed to
    accept a timespec time value and an additional flags parameter.
    Additionally the sys_utime function was changed to match compat_sys_utime
    which already use do_utimes instead of duplicating the work.
    Also, the completely missing futimensat() functionality is added.  We have
    such a function in glibc but we have to resort to using /proc/self/fd/* which
    not everybody likes (chroot etc).
    Test application (the syscall number will need per-arch editing):
