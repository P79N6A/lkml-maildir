Hi Adrian,
That would open precedence on "exceptions" - one could argue that
different classes of updates can't do much harm either.
The maintenance process should concentrate on problems which can affect
installations running legacy v2.4.
Another point in favour of restricting updates on the v2.4 tree are
external patches. There are a bunch of them being cultivated by the
community. For them, the less changes in mainline, the better.
