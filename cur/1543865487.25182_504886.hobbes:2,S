Maybe I misunderstood what you meant, above. I have an alterative fix
where a temporary page is allocated if the write enncounters a non
uptodate page. The usercopy then goes into that page, and from there
into the target page after we have opened the prepare_write().
My *first* idea to fix this was to do the atomic copy into a non-uptodate
page and then calling a zero-length commit_write if it failed. I pretty
carefully constructed all these good arguments as to why each case works
properly, but in the end it just didn't fly because it broke lots of
filesystems.

I've thought. Quite a lot. I have 2 other approaches that don't require
mmap_sem, and 1 which is actually possible to implement without breaking
filesystems.

Both pages? I don't get it.
You set the don't-reclaim vma flag, then run get_user, which takes a
page fault and potentially has to allocate N pages for pagetables,
pagecache readahead, buffers and fs private data and pagecache radix
tree nodes for all of the pages read in.

I'm not convinced.
