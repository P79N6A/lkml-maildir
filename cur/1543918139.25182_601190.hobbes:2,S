Good, fine by me; but forces me to confess, with abject shame,
that I still haven't sent you some shmem/tmpfs fixes/cleanups
(currently intermingled with some other stuff in my tree, I'm
still disentangling).  Nothing so bad as to mess up a bisection,
but my loop-over-tmpfs tests hang without passing gfp_mask down
and down to add_to_swap_cache; and a few other bits.  I'll get
back on to it.
