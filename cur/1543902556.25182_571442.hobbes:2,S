Its actually more a problem on the RX path. VLAN acceleration
works (at least with some drivers) by enabling HW header striping
and using the VLAN ID for an immediate lookup in the VLAN devices
configured on that device. So if the VLAN is not configured on the
real device but something like macvlan, it will get the packet
without a header and without any indication that this was a VLAN
packet. This is also what causes the tcpdump problem.
On the TX path, it could simply use the CB, but this is actually
also wrong (for both macvlan and real devices) since qdiscs have
ownership of the skb in between, and at least netem *does* modify
the CB, breaking VLAN.

Optimizations for macvlan are not too important, I agree. But for
tcpdump I consider it a bug.

That would also be fine. But considering that the TX path is
problematic too, a clean solution for all of this would be
to store the VLAN id in the skb. And we do have some holes
to plug currently :)
