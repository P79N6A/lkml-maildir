Agreed.
For my own userland projects, I'm starting to feel the need for network 
AIO, since it is more natural:  the hardware operations themselves are 
asynchronous.

That's an interesting thought.

We're talking about CISC here!  ;-) ;-)
[note: I'm the type of person who would stuff the kernel + glibc onto an 
FPGA, if I could]
I would love to see Intel, AMD, VIA (others?) compete by adding selected 
transforms/checksums/hashs to their chips, though this method.  Just 
provide a method to enumerate what transforms are supported on <this> 
chip...
