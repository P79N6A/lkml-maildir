Ok thanks for all the help.
One final note before i end this (since there still seems to be some 
misunderstanding) is that the reply comes back successful for the first 
of the 2 redundant transaction IDs.  Its not a retransmit.  ID 101 gets 
sent from the linux box and receives a response successfully.  It then 
sends another reqeust with ID 101 _after_ it received the response for 
101.  That is my issue and that is what is breaking the communication 
thru the firewall.  It should be using a new ID after a successful dns 
transaction but it is not.
I understand this has deviated from the topic of the linux kernel so we 
can consider this thread dead.
thanks everybody for all their input and help.
