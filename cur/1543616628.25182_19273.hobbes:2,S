Subject: [NFS] some strangeness (at least) with linux-2.4.17-NFS_ALL patch

Hi Trond et al.,
after applying $subject and resolving the rej with 2.4.18-pre1, 
I found the following strangeness in my SuSE 7.3 based NFS diskless setup:
Trying to start openuniverse for the first time (ever), it complaint about
a missing config file. SuSE installed it's data at /usr/share/openuniverse 
with the config file conf/ou.conf symlinked to ../../../../etc/ou.conf (=> 
/etc/ou.conf), which was missing within my diskless setup.
The problem is, ls on the client side complains about an I/O error, when 
listing the conf/ dir.
After removing this symlink (within the server), ls is OK within
the client. Trying to copy servers /etc/ou.conf file to
/usr/share/openuniverse within the client, cp complains about to many levels 
of symlinks?!? (/usr is shared)
May be I missed/confused some patches. I could send you a plain
copy of the interresting modules, if you like. 
Somehow, the dir entry on the client survived the rm from the server.
Compiling/KDE 2.2.2 Desktop is working fine so far.
Any ideas?
Cheers,
Hans-Peter
