As noted already, I don't know much of CIFS and SAMBA.
But are you saying that it is sensible and consistent that
"a process can open a file read-write, and can't place a 
read lease, but can place a write lease"?

                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is precisely the point of the problem.  Stephen

Cheers,
Michael
