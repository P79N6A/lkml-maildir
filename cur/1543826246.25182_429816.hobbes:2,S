ok this is a real driver deadlock:
The ns83820 driver enabled interrupts (by unlocking the misc_lock with
_irq) while still holding the rx_info.lock, which is required to be irq
safe since it's used in the ISR like this:
                writel(1, dev->base + IER);
                spin_unlock_irq(&dev->misc_lock);
                kick_rx(ndev);
                spin_unlock_irq(&dev->rx_info.lock);
This is can cause a deadlock if an irq was pending at the first
spin_unlock_irq already, or if one would hit during kick_rx(). 
Simply remove the first _irq solves this
