I just want a statement from a (E)IDE guy why there is no
"eide-[add|remove]-single-device blah blah" proc-interface
(I meen device re-probing not if-reprobing).
This could make the life of notebook users (with removable disk/floppy/cdrom)
much easier...
Does nobody else miss this cool SCSI feature under IDE ?
Isn't Linux-SCSI better because of this ? ;-}
