Actually, you're probably right about (2), but (3)?
From the gcc manual:
<quote>
Similarly, you can't expect a sequence of volatile asm instructions to
remain perfectly consecutive. If you want consecutive output, use a
single asm. Also GCC will perform some optimizations across a volatile
asm instruction, GCC does not "forget everything" when it encounters a
volatile asm instruction the way some other compilers do.

I'm reading "Similarly, you can't expect a sequence of volatile asm
instructions to remain perfectly consecutive" to mean they're talking
about something like:
asm volatile(...);
asm volatile(...);
asm volatile(...);
But "If you want consecutive output, use a single asm" probably means:
asm volatile(... multiple instructions here ...);
would actually ensure the code written in there would not be
interspersed ... at least that's how I read it.
[ BTW "Also GCC will perform some optimizations across a volatile
asm instruction ..." is exactly the kind of optimizations we must
allow the compiler to do, but that's not related to point at hand. ]

Yup, of course.
