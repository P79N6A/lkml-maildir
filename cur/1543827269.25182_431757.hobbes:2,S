And once again this has *nothing* to do with inode allocation, or
dynamic allocation of inode tables.  Your "performance issue" has to
do with a difference in blocksizes.  If you ext2/3 to pass your silly
test, then upgrade to the latest e2fsprogs and install the following
/etc/mke2fs.conf:
[defaults]
	base_features = sparse_super,filetype,resize_inode,dir_index
	blocksize = 4096
	inode_ratio = 8192
[fs_types]
	small = {
		blocksize = 4096
		inode_ratio = 8192
	}
	floppy = {
		blocksize = 4096
		inode_ratio = 8192
	}
Happy now?
