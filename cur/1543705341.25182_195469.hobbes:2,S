I think this is fine. It keeps backwards compatibility with
people's old scripts and still it allows arbitrary scancodes.

Well, I think it's a bad idea to have the userspace tool know about the
e0 thing at all. It should be just opaque numbers to it.
I agree that the above code choosing between 0x80 and 0x100 is not very
nice, but it has two reasons:
	0) e0+(00..7f) is the most common code for extra keys in set2,
	   while (80..df) is the most common code for extra keys in set3
	
	1) it will work in old setkeycodes - although the values you'll
           have to specify with set3 are rather nonsensical, you still
	   will be able to set extra keys on a set3 keyboard.
	2) the scancode tables are much more compact.
I don't have a problem with swapping the set3 table, if setkeycodes
works reasonably now for scancodes above 128.
