Well, my idea was for process to &~ PF_NOFREEZE on itself.
We are currently (kernel/power/process.c) using &p->sighand->siglock
for some accesses, and no locking for others. There were some attempts
to fix this, but they led to problems, and we are not hitting any
problems... part of reason is that we hot-unplug non-boot cpus before
freezing processes, so we are running UP at that point.
