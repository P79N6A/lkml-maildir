Note that then we should move the panic to the irq routing part (ie
MPBIOS_trigger() and MPBIOS_polarity friends). Although right now we have
just a printk() there, and I think I'd prefer it that way. Maybe just make
it bigger letters..

No, I meant our internal numbers for the bus: the MP_BUS_ISA etc numberng
scheme. Let's make _that_ numbering scheme say that "0" is just unknown,
and let's initialize unknown buses to zero (right now we initialize the
_first_ unknown bus to -1, but all other unknown buses are 0, which is
really the same thing as MP_BUS_ISA).
