This could be handled by a function that transforms the value read from
the counter into an incrementing value. I.e.
u64 get_rev_timerval(void) {
	return  1<< 55 - readq(TIMER_PORT);
}

There is no reason to update time_source_at_base unless adjustments need
to be done or a danger exists of the counter wrapping around (16 bit
counter?)

These are the raw routines. Higher level function could translate a delta
into the appropriate adjustments.

They are related because the maximum shift for a 64 bit value without
loosing bits is 64 - number of significant bits. This basically insures
maximum precision when scaling the counter.

Right. I just thought of the standard case HZ=1000.

Nope. time_source_last is the global. l is just a copy of
time_source_last.

One could do this but we want to have a tickless system. The tick is only
necessary if the time needs to be adjusted.
But you are right there is the need for timer event scheduling that is
not included yet. This should be a method of the time source.
