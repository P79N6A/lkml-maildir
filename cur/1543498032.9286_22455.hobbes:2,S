I was wondering if that were the reason, but was procrastinating
looking up the relevant docs.

Yes.  Very seldom.  Only 3 times so far for me.
I also have since noticed that I get occasional missed events (both
key press and mouse clicks).  I tend to write such things off as not
having pressed the key/button hard enough -- and indeed the kbd is a
very cheap one (only 105-key one I could find that day) -- but the
mouse is doing it a bit as well.  Still very seldom, say on the order
of once per hour of a good mix of coding/compiling/debugging, reading
mail/news and surfing.  Load was high each time it happened (compiling
an RPM of gimp-1.1.6; only took 5 times to get it right, if this time
is indeed right. [SIGH])
