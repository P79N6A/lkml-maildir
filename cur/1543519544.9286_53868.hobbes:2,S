I was actually on the client machine trying to mount the dir on the server and 
watching the server log fill up with the SYN flood messages, so I can verify 
that no spoofing was occuring - it was all me.

I'd believe that.  Likely, these problems will go away when we make our next 
distribution release and everyone at the Lab upgrades to the 2.2.x kernel - we 
still have over a year before the Tevatron goes into collider mode and we have 
real data streaming in.  Heck, maybe we'll have 3.0.x by then.
Cheers,
Dan
