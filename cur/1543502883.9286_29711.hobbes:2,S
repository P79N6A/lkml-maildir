If two filehandles are the same, then that point to the same file 
(bag o bits).  If two filehandles are different then they may or
may not point to the same file.  The current Linux nfs server returns
different filehandles for the same hard linked file if it is opened
from different directories.  This is because the parent directory is
part of the filehandle.

P.S. This is for clarification and NOT for discussion.  We all would like
     this to be different!
