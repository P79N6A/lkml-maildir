No, the problem is that "git diff" is apparently broken by a recent 
optimization. The diff is simply broken.
The tar-ball and the git archive itself is fine, but yes, the diff from 
2.6.23 to 2.6.24-rc6 is bad. It's the "trim_common_tail()" optimization 
that has caused way too much pain.
Sorry about that, I'll fix it up asap.
