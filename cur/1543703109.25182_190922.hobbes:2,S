I have a Belkin Omniview SE 4, a four port KVM, with keyboard and
mouse provided to a Linux box via USB.
Under 2.4.23, the device works well. The keyboard and mouse are
detected.
Under 2.6.0 (Debian build), the keyboard is not recognized.
I have verified that hid and usbkbd are loaded, and if I plug a USB
keyboard directly into the machine, the keyboard is recognized
properly.
/proc/bus/usb is empty -- with 2.4, I would have gone there to verify
that the device was seen. Is there any data I can pull from 2.6 which
might help diagnose this?
Is /proc/bus/input/handlers the proper analog?
