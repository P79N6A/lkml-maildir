fake major is easy, it allows you to register ubd device on two majors.
This is useful e.g. for installing distros inside of UML.
Distro installers are tend to look for IDE disk on major 3, for example.
Then if you boot with ubd=3, installer will find the disk ;)
Actually the patch consits of two parts, as there might be more than one
ubd device, we need to name them differently.
Actually I just see that if one enables fake major stuff, the sysfs will still
be upset, as names for both UBD_MAJOR and fake_major would be the same.
So perhaps fillowing patch should be used.
