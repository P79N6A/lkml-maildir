Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong...
 From my understanding, inline has asolutely nothing to do with 
assembly.  When a function is declared as inline, you're basically 
telling the compiler that anytime it runs into this function being 
called, to replace that call with the body of the function (to eliminate 
the overhead of making the function call).  It's great for small, little 
operations that are done extremely often.
