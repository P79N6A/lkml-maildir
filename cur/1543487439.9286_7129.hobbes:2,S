 sorry to be such a clueless listclogger, but could someone explain what
this means for me? What signals are being discussed? and are their really
6 signals that consistently bring down the system (are they supposed to?)
or JUST dump core? why so many?
and last question, 
why is there ambiguity within the kernel and glibc about these strange
signals?
