All right, so far so good.

This, however, is not good. Not good at all. If sysrq is not working, that 
means the interrupts are disabled or the bus is completely wedged. The 
driver never disables interrupts, and the ioctl() function is not called 
with the interrupts disabled, so that's not a possible cause. Furthermore, 
the ioctl() function does something very mundane (reading a few 
registers), which definitely shouldn't cause lock ups.
I'm sorry, I don't have any good news for you... I really don't think the 
problem is in the driver.
Just for the kicks, can you strace mii-diag when it locks up, to see on 
which ioctl() call it locks up? I don't think that will help much, but...

I get the IRQ7 one as well, it's not something to be overly concerned 
with.

Could very well be broken, unfortunately.

Do you have any other cardbus cards to test if they work with this laptop?
Thanks,
