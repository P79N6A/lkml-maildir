That's a shame, because the rest of the world is having a party round
my house on Tuesday Feb 29, so its a pity you won't be able to come.
This is the relevant page from the UK governments Time Metrology unit:
http://www.npl.co.uk/npl/ctm/faq_index.html#2000_a_leap_year
If you don't believe the UK govt scientists, here are the US navy pages
about it:

Here is the (correct) output of "cal 2 2000" on my redhat boxes:
