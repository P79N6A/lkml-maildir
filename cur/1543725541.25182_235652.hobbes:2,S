I am confused. CONFIG_NET_RADIO is set when you select "Wireless LAN 
drivers". But building of drivers/net/wireless depends on 
CONFIG_NET_WIRELESS, but not a single Kconfig defines this value (it is 
defined in some defconfigs though). So the wireless LAN drivers are 
never built.
What am I missing???
