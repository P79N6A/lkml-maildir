There's a common misconception that the swap space one needs is
exactly proportional to the amount of RAM one has, and this looks like
a classic example of that...
Can I state FROM EXPERIENCE that the so-called rule that swap space
should be 1.5 times RAM size is BOGUS!!! Some systems need much more,
others run happily on much less...
My experience has been that the following apply...
 1. All systems should have at least 4M of swap space, as Linux is (or
    at least appears to be) less stable otherwise.
 2. Where a system has multiple hard drives, Linux appears to be more
    stable with a swap area on each drive than having some drives with
    no swap area on them.
 3. The sum of RAM and swap space should be at least 32M on a system
    that is not running X, and at least 64M on a system that is
    running X.
 4. Too much swap space is not a problem, but too little swap space
    really hurts.
 5. If the system in question regularly runs with more than 67% of its
    swap space used, more swap space should be allocated.
Personally, I just allocate one 124M swap partition on each drive
installed, always as a primary partition, and leave it at that. I've
never had problems as a result of that policy, and with modern 2G+
drives, the loss of 124M of data area per drive isn't even noticed.

I've never needed to do that, but can understand its use.

True, but irrelevant - whether the space is unused because it hasn't
been partitioned, or unused because no use is being made of the
partition, it's still being wasted at that time.
