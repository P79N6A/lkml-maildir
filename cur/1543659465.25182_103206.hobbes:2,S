True - it has to be only done once per CPU bring-up.
To investigate all the corners of this issue: is it possible now, tomorrow,
on in the future to mix Intel processors on the same machine? Isn't it
enough really to collect the APIC version of boot CPU and just use it for
the rest? Or do we have to leave the opportunity for such occasion in the
code?
