Hi,
using the latest git checkout of the xf86 intel driver
(f1e9ca4e4fb3ddb083252aea79c67c5e5e71f29c),
xorg 1.5.3 and kernel 2.6.28 git head
(3d14bdad40315b54470cb7812293d14c8af2bf7d), both from
10/January, the inteldrmfb module correctly initializes the display to
its native mode (1440x900),
Lenovo X300, but X fails to start with the following error:
(WW) xf86AcquireGART: AGPIOC_ACQUIRE failed (Device or resource busy)
(EE) GARTInit: AGPIOC_INFO failed (Invalid argument)
(WW) intel(0): /dev/agpgart is either not available, or no memory is available
for allocation.  Using pre-allocated memory only.

The complete log and dmesg is attached.
Relevant xorg.conf entry:
Section "Device"
       Identifier      "Configured Video Device"
       Option "RenderAccel" "on"
       Option "XvMCSurface" "7"
       Option "XvMC" "on"
       Option "Legacy3D" "off"
EndSection
How can I fix this? As I said, the hardware is a Lenovo X300, GM965
graphics. Is this a kernel or xorg driver bug?
Thanks,
Jan
ps: Kernel Mode Setting severly lacks documentation...
