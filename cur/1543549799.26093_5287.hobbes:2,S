I saw CONFIG_KDB_FRAMEPTR being used in the LKCD patch for 2.4.0-test7
(arch/i386/kernel/vmdump.c). If I am correct then it is used there to find
out if the kernel is being compiled with frame pointer (inorder to get the
correct offset of the return address). I think CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER should
be used instead.

Sushil.
