Mind you that there a already many packages to allow audio over network :
- nas ( Network Audio System ) 
ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/audio/nas/nas-1.2p5.tar.gz
- rplay          
http://rplay.doit.org/
- AF      
http://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/digital/AF/AF3R1.tar.Z
- Xaudio   (not finished) 
ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/audio/Xaudio
- probably some others too.
Most of them can be used as good local audio API too, at least nas allows multiple
simultanous clients.
