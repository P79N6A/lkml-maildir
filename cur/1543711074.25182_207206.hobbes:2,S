Best would be to try and have userspace do it for you.
If you really need to do it in the kernel on the fly, you'll need to either
1) save and restore the floating point context yourself
2) use fixed point calculations
As an optimization for 2, you could pre-calculate some lookup tables and 
interpolate.
