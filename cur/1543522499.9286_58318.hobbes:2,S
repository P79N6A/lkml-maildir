I'll start off by saying that I never would have thought that such an
offhand discussion on my part would make itself to the level of
unfortunate time-wasting on the kernel list, I'll apologize and state that
I'm not planning on continuing this thread (much), sufficed to say in

It was quite clear, hence my request for a citation, if possible. I think
someone else has already provided one to RFCs.

Is is my imagination or is ip_forward on, on redhat 6.1 dist by default? I
can't remember.

Uhm, this wouldn't be an issue of security through obscurity, that's a
little hard with FS/Open Source.  '/sbin/ipchains -L' is hardly a secret,
nor is 'less net/core/firewall.c'. Sorry, this is just a cheap shot.

"As long as..." that's the crux, eh. My original message indicated that in
my situation I have to bring up the external interface to get it's IP,
then build my ruleset.

To tell you the truth, I'm going to defer to the immanent (eminent?)
experts on this list and try to avoid saying what should and shouldn't go
into the kernel.
My original comment was something along the lines of, "that perhaps the
truly paranoid might want to do something like that..." I don't remember
suggesting petitioning the powers-that-be to make this change anywhere
except possibly on my own system.

You're doing a good job of not arguing about pointless.
I'm gonna just drop it.

On reflection, it seems that perhaps anything except default forward =
DENY might be a little silly (paranoid?), but then again, you can always
work around this by, as you put it, ordering your initscripts properly in
userspace and a couple of ipchains commands.

My whole point from the beginning is that it's hard to build your firewall
ruleset and load them before bringing up an interface on a DHCP system
(I've setup a handful of home cable/adsl firewall systems, granted perhaps
this is uncommon) without first bringing up an interface to get today's IP
number. At no time did I suggest packets were magically appearing out
of thin air. You're beating this dead horse and it's getting smelly.

Valid point. Less systems if only default forwarding is DENY, correct?

I'm just gonna ignore this. I'd like to strike previous questions about
suggesting anyone do anything, particularly you Mike.

I've got nothing but boxes like this. None of them are laptops (somebody
can send me a nice one if they like, I'd like to get a FreeS/WAN
roadwarrior setup going ;-) Anyway, I'm not gonna pretend I know the
*average* setup, my sample size is too small.

One man's potato is another man's potato. Rare to you,
common to me. But I digress...
Anyway, I can't be bothered to go on responding to your message, you're
the one who forwarded this to the list, and I'm willing to guess that
everyone'd be just as happy if I dropped this packet^H^H message on the
floor right here.
