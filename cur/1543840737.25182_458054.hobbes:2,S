Ah, I didn't realize that it was already in git. It does take
care of create_workqueue callers, however I don't see why this
is needed - 
+ break;
+
+ case CPU_DOWN_PREPARE:
+ 	mutex_lock(&workqueue_mutex);
+ 	break;
+
+ case CPU_DOWN_FAILED:
+ 	mutex_unlock(&workqueue_mutex);
	break;
This seems like some implicit code locking to me. Why is it not
sufficient to hold the lock in the CPU_DEAD code while walking
the workqueues ?
Thanks
