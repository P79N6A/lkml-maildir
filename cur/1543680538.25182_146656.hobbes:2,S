It's not that anyone hates them, it's that
pass 1: the semantics (0 == empty cpu set) needed preserving
pass 2: remove code instead of changing redundant stuff
NFI YTF gcc doesn't optimize out the whole shebang.
At any rate, if we're pounding APM BIOS calls or apm_power_off()
like wild monkeys there's something far more disturbing going wrong
than 64B of code gcc couldn't optimize (it's probably due to some
jump target being aligned to death or some such nonsense).
