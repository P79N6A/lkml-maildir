I think this is a problem that hit Coda at some point. We used to have a
linked list that linked all the inodes together. However not long after
the RCU changes, I noticed that this linked list occasionally got
corrupted. I didn't want to dig too deep into all the dcache related
changes where I thought the problem came from, nobody else seemed to be
complaining and the linked list wasn't really necessary so I worked
around the problem by removing the linked list strucure.
But I think you found the actual cause and this patch looks good to me,
it probably should get merged.
