2.4.10-pre3 and later fail to boot on my Compaq XL box. It claims that PCI 
isn't supported. This board doesn't use the PCI BIOS because the entry 
point is in high memory.
'cvs up -r v2_4_10-pre2 arch/i386/boot/pci-pc.c' fixes it.
A happy boot with the old pci-pc.c:
PCI: BIOS32 entry (0xc00fa000) in high memory, cannot use.
PCI: Using configuration type 2
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
An unhappy boot with the new one:
PCI: BIOS32 entry (0xc00fa000) in high memory, cannot use.
PCI: System does not support PCI
An unhappy boot with the new one and 'pci=conf2':
PCI: Using configuration type 2
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
