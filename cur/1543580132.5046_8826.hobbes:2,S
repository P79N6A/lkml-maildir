Andrey posted a patch last week, which obviously fixes the 82559 problems.
It's in Linus' latest 2.4.1-pre release too. I have an 82559 and with the
patch there've been no issues here yet - so things are looking good so far.
I suggest that instead of having 3 drivers (eepro100, e100, freebsd), people
should just work together, look at the goodies of each driver and merge them
into one perfect driver.
