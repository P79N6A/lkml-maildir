I don't see that as much of a problem. The mess arises from some simple
lacks in the objects in kernel and the methods required to co-ordinate.
Lots of drivers are written by a lot of people in the kernel and they
work just fine. The ext3 authors don't spend their lives co-ordinating
with SCSI driver authors, they just get the API right.
