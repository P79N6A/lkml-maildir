This can lead to holes anyway, because not all ways of logging into a 
system use the shell from /etc/passwd.  For example, xdm usually runs
.Xsession, and at least with older RedHat installations it was possible
to use "X -query victim" and get a window manager with an Emacs in
the menus and the rest is easy.
