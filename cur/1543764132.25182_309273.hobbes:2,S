It also includes Kconfig.orig & Makefile.orig &
m528xsim.h.orig .
You should use
   diff -X dontdiff
where dontdiff is a filename to exclude the listed files,
where dontdiff includes *.orig .
There is a fairly up-to-date dontdiff file available at
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/doc/dontdiff-osdl
A diffstat summary would (hereby requested in the future)
would let us see which files are modified and how much
they are modified:

  drivers/i2c/busses/Kconfig.orig       |  489

linux_dev/include/asm-m68knommu/m528xsim.h:
some spaces in this expression (& elsewhere) would make it
easier to read:
+#define MCF5282_I2C_I2ADR_ADDR(x) 
(((x)&0x7F)<<0x01)
Oh, it's not even used.... don't need it then.
And this one is not used:
+#define MCF5282_I2C_I2FDR_IC(x)                         (((x)&0x3F))
Lots of the bit-level definitions aren't used and usually aren't
added unless used.
Comment (7) doesn't match name (hm, and it's not used):
+/* Interrupt Control Register 7 */
+#define MCF5282_INTC0_ICR17     (volatile u8 *) (MCF_IPSBAR + 0x0C51)
These are not used -- but if they were, we generally like to
have macro expressions wrapped in parentheses:
+#define MCF5282_QSPI_QMR        MCF_IPSBAR + 0x0340
+#define MCF5282_QSPI_QDLYR      MCF_IPSBAR + 0x0344
+#define MCF5282_QSPI_QWR        MCF_IPSBAR + 0x0348
+#define MCF5282_QSPI_QIR        MCF_IPSBAR + 0x034C
+#define MCF5282_QSPI_QAR        MCF_IPSBAR + 0x0350
+#define MCF5282_QSPI_QDR        MCF_IPSBAR + 0x0354
+#define MCF5282_QSPI_QCR        MCF_IPSBAR + 0x0354
i2c-mcf5282.h:
Please limit line lengths to 80 characters in source files:  e.g.:
+static int mcf5282_i2c_start(const char read_write, const u16 
target_address, const enum I2C_START_TYPE i2c_start);
What is this one for?
+void dumpReg(char *, u16 addr, u8 data);
I'm looking over the primary .c file separately now.
