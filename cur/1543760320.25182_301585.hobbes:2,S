Exactly. Don't kill all lines with .id though, only the i2c_client id
was dropped, and there are plenty of other ids in the media/video
drivers.

Not necessarily wrong. It is possible that the same diode temperature is
read from the W83627HF chip by both the ACPI subsystem and by the
w83627hf driver. But if this is the case, I would be worried by
concurrent I/O accesses to the chip, which could possibly cause trouble.
