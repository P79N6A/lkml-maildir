Well, to my belief the irq_all() stuff is overkill as Alan points out.  
However, Alan also implies that during the init stage we should be holding 
the card lock and using that to disable interrupts.  I disagree with that 
since we may already have other entry points looking at our card and we 
don't want the card lock held until after it has been initted and is ready 
for real use. So, I would leave it just like the patch to fix up the sti 
usage left it.
