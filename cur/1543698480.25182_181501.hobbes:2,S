I think you just need your application to encrypt data where needed.
Or to read/write to an encrypted file-system which always encrypts.
You really don't want policy inside the kernel.
Let's say you decided to ignore me and do it anyway. The file-systems
are a bunch of inodes. Every time you want to read or write one, something
has to decide if it's encrypted and, if it is, how to encrypt or
decrypt it. Even the length of the required read or write becomes
dependent upon the type of encryption being used. Surely you don't
want to use an algorithm where a N-byte string gets encoded into a
N-byte string because to do so gives away the length, from which
one can derive other aspects, resulting in discovering the true content.
So, you need variable-length inodes --- what a mess. The result
would be one of the slowest file-systems you could devise.
Encrypted file-systems, where you encrypt everything that goes
on the media work. Making something that could be either/or,
while possible, is not likely going to be very satisfying.
