It is not an new ABI, its an extension as per the way it was documented
to work.

The problem is the "bad" ABI has existed in that form since somewhere
around 2.6.15 and it is therefore too late to drop things from it or
rearrange it. The ABI described additions being allowed so we're taking
advantage of that to gain something which should have really been there
originally. Short term there is some complexity with some limits but
they're going away so there is no problem.
The whole point of the naming was so at a glance you can tell which LEDs
are which and whilst the device name isn't important in the things
you're considering, in general it does make sense, particularly if we
see LEDs attached to removable hardware for example.
The alternative is we throw the whole thing away and go to random
numbers for the different LEDs and attributes. To work out which LED is
which you then have to read up to 3 files per LED before you can even
decide whether its the one you want. I don't like that idea...
Cheers,
