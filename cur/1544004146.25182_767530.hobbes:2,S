OK, I'm so not getting this patch..
if normal newly idle balancing fails that means the other runqueue has
only a single task on it (or some other really stubborn stuff), so then
you go move that one task that is already running, from one cpu to
another.
_why_?
The only answer I can come up with is that you prefer one cpu's
idle-ness over another - which makes sense, as you try to get whole
packages idle.
But I'm not seeing where that package logic is hidden..
