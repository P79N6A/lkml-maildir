Hi,
I'm not sure if this has already been covered, but I'm seeing something
I'm not convinced is quite right from 2.4.0-test5.
I have a uniprocessor machine here which is reporting a load average
of 1.6 while running a single copy of diff on two kernel trees, one
of which is located over NFS.
As I say, I'm seeing a load average of 1.6, which in itself may be
reasonable (since rpciod is having to do some work).  However, what
I don't understand is why I've got about 50% CPU idle time.
Surely if I'm running at a load avg > 1, I should be seeing close to
0% CPU idle?
Looking for enlightenment... (and I don't mean the window manager) ;)
