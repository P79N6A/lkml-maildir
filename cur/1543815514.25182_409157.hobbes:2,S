Subject: [PATCH 2/2] add flush_kernel_dcache_page() API
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We have a problem in a lot of emulated storage in that it takes a page
from get_user_pages() and does something like
kmap_atomic(page)
modify page
kunmap_atomic(page)
However, nothing has flushed the kernel cache view of the page before
the kunmap.  We need a lightweight API to do this, so this new API
would specifically be for flushing the kernel cache view of a user
page which the kernel has modified.  The driver would need to add
flush_kernel_dcache_page(page) before the final kunmap.
