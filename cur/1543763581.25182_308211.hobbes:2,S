Ken initially observed with older kernels(2.4 kernel with Ingo's sched), it was 
happening with few hundred processes. 2.6 is not that bad and it improved
with recent fixes. It is not very important. We want to raise the flag
and see if we can comeup with a decent solution.
We changed nr_running from "unsigned long" to "unsigned int". So on 64-bit
architectures, our change to fastpath is not a big deal.

Coming up with that number(how much to exceed) will be a big task. It depends
on number of cpus and how fast they traverse the runqueue,...
