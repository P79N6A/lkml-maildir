IRQ sharing is an excellent example, not a counter-example,
of why it is necessary to disable devices and free IRQs
on suspend, and acquire them again on resume.
eg. if a device is suspended, but the hardware still causes
an interrupt on a shared IRQ, another device can
suffer a screaming IRQ failure.
Documentation/power/pci.txt has as much as we know about
how to address this -- but I'm certainly open to suggestions
on how to be less invasive to the drivers while having some
chance of being robust.
thanks,
