I thought there was a switch somewhere to override the command executed 
on the other machine?  You could try pulling from the machine outside 
the firewall via ssh, and changing the command from git-upload-pack to 
another ssh command to connect to kernel.org and invoke git-upload-pack 
there.  That should bounce the connection off the one machine you can 
ssh to outside the firewall.
