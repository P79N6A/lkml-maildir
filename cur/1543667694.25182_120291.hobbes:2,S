Hi to All,
	I have recently found in a drawer a somewhat old NIC which linux 
identifies as a 'Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. 
RTL-8029(AS)'.
Here are my questions :
1. Does Linux already support this NIC ?
2. Is there documentation available for me to write this driver ?
3. For wich kernel shall I write it (2.4 or 2.5/2.6) ?
Any insight appreciated.
Joe
