Subject: [patch 04/16] vfs: fix permission checking in sys_utimensat

2.6.25-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.
------------------
From: Miklos Szeredi <mszeredi@suse.cz>
commit: 02c6be615f1fcd37ac5ed93a3ad6692ad8991cd9 upstream
If utimensat() is called with both times set to UTIME_NOW or one of them to
UTIME_NOW and the other to UTIME_OMIT, then it will update the file time
without any permission checking.
I don't think this can be used for anything other than a local DoS, but could
be quite bewildering at that (e.g.  "Why was that large source tree rebuilt
when I didn't modify anything???")
This affects all kernels from 2.6.22, when the utimensat() syscall was
introduced.
Fix by doing the same permission checking as for the "times == NULL" case.
Thanks to Michael Kerrisk, whose utimensat-non-conformances-and-fixes.patch in
-mm also fixes this (and breaks other stuff), only he didn't realize the
security implications of this bug.
