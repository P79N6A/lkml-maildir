So capabilities then just seems like a hack.  You can write a trusted
user space suid gateway program that consults a database, builds you a
temporary file system with links and permissions to an otherwise hidden
shared tree and puts you safely in that "temporary  tree". If I understand
what this does.
As for Al, he may be a great programmer, but it's his polemical 
writing style I appreciate most.
