And the problem with such a "solution" is
mv /usr/bin/emacs /usr/bin/old-emacs
Do this with an ordinary fs, and the /metas/usr/bin/emacs/icon
won't move with it.  Now metas might might not be an ordinary fs,
so perhaps the move happens automatically there, but if so
it will be unexpected.

Having to go up to root and then down a similar but different path to 
reach a
file's metadata seems very counterintuitive to me.  And you have to 
update all
tools to do this automatically, or it'll be hopeless to actually use.
