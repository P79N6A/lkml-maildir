Isn't the de-facto standard that:
kill -<sig> -1
... should send the signal to everyone but the one executing the call?
For years, the "quick way" to shut down a Unix system was:
kill -TERM -1
sync
kill -KILL -1
sync
umount -a
... hit power switch...
Eliminating the ability to shut down a system in a few seconds is
gonna make a lot of persons unhappy --especially if one has to run
the RH kiddie scripts that take forever...... 
Cheers,
