It seems to me that test8-vm3 handles this fine.   in test9 upon loading X i was
already using swap and down to 10MB ...  here i have netscape loaded and some other
stuff along with gaim and i've got 36MB free still.   I'm not so sure you can chalk
this up totally to X ....  test9 is a VERY VERY poor kernel compared to test8-vm3
