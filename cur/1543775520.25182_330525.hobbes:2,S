The driver (whatever that is), if it was written for a 64-bit
platform, can write a 64-bit word in one operation and it's
transparent. If the driver was written for a 32-bit environment,
it will still work because there is compatibility with PCI 2.x
FYI, this machine has a PCI-X bus. I have some 32-bit cards
plugged into it (SCSI controller, etc.). They work. I also
have a 64-bit card plugged into it (fiber-optic data link).
It also works, but at 133 MHz. Software never talks to it
in 'long longs' so the increased data-width isn't being used.
Warning!  Many 5-volt cards may not work on the PCI-X bus.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
