It works flawlessly on all hubs you tested, iff other ports are unused.
Unfortunately it needs to work on all hubs, even if all ports are used.

udev can do all it wants if it is running with sufficient priviledge level.
That doesn't change the need for a safe default. The system must run
safely even if udev has gone south or is not installed.

Data loss. Possibly even on other devices and not reproducible.

Maybe we should generate a specific "over power budget" event.
Sympathy is well and good, but partial here. Any option will screw one
group. In this case we go with the standard.
