Lots of solutions from David ...
The Sony is a bad example, once you know how to install from
the bootable cd, you realise that the *Linux* pcmcia drivers are not
involved.  The hardware sets it up as a regular ide cd drive. (On RH
after the first boot from the hard drive the pcmcia drivers are used)
The problem with the Sony is that it is not at a standard io port, so
ide2 fails to be found.  The answer on the Sony is to append the 
correct ioports on the kernel boot line, then the install goes along
as normal.
Now, if all bootable pcmcia cd-roms were treated this way life would
be a little bit easier.
Mike
Now for real fun try to do a network install over pcmcia with a network
card with an unsupported driver :-)
