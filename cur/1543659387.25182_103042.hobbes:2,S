Do "char sym_name[CONSTANT];". What's so hard to understand about that?

Actually, the gcc thing and the C99 thing are significantly different, and  
neither is a sub- or superset of the other. In fact, gcc's C99-conformance  
page (
http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html
) still lists VLAs as "broken".
See here for at least some explanation:

For the GNU extension, maybe.
