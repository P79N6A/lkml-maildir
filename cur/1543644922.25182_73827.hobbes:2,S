You had, ofcourse right, it was in my syslog. But the keystroke that
make my computer freeze isn't there. This is the last line:
kernel: atkbd.c: Received 1d flags 00
But I find this line several places, so it's obviously not the one
causing the crash. Altough, when passing i8042_direct to the kernel,
everything works just as expected. My keyboard is a Logitech Cordless
Desktop. The keyboard and mouse shares the same receiver, which both is
connected via ps/2.
