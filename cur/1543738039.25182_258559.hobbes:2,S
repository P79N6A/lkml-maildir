The real way to do this is to put it in a Kconfig file.  
something like:
config HOLES_IN_ZONE
	bool
	depends on VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP
right below where 'config VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP' is defined.  That way, if any
other architectures need it, they alter their Kconfig files instead of
headers.  Also, it leaves the possibility of having an arch-independent
Kconfig file for memory-related options which I'd like to do in the
future.
