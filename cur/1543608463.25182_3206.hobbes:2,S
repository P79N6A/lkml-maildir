You mean you bios doesn't allow you to choose whether you have a PNP OS or 
not?!? That would be very unusual (unless you have a Dell...). Linux is not 
a PNP OS and hence problems like yours often get fixed by setting in the 
BIOS that you are not using a PNP OS. Windows still works fine with PNP OS 
= NO btw. - On my P4 I had to set PNP OS = NO otherwise I couldn't get my 
sound card to work...
