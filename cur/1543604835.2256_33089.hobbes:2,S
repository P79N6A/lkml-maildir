Most of the time, you either have the IO overhead (and whether you use
read or mmap won't matter all that much, because you're IO limited), or
the thing is cached.
For gcc, it's cached 99% of the time, because most of the IO ends up being
header files (this is, of course, assuming that you're compiling a big
project, but if you're not, the big overhead is in loading _gcc_, not in
the pages it reads).

No no. Read my thing again. On swap-out, you just move the thing to the
swap cache.
Sure, that removes it from the regular cache, and that's possibly a
performance problem. But

No. Why would you "read" shared libraries? read is read, mmap is mmap. If
you want mmap, use mmap. Don't mess it up with MAP_COPY, which is not mmap
at all.
