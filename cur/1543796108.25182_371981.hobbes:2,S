Ben,
Do you have these patches maintained on a website somewhere too.  I'd be
willing to test these patches out, without testing all of -mm (my x86_64
box needs to be pretty stable). I have the confidence of using your
patches without breaking too much ;-)
I'll apply the ones you posted to LKML, but I would like to also know
where any updates are.
Thanks,
-- Steve
