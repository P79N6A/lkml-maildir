Read the OSS sound drivers, people have put a lot of time into coding
and debugging those open(2) routines :)

Well, if you already probe elsewhere, one could easily EXPORT_SYMBOL
such information from the main driver, so you would need to only check a
variable.
But I agree in principle with you about probing and PNP, just saying we
need to look at the big picture too, what other SC1200 modules are in
the system and what info/capabilities they provide.
