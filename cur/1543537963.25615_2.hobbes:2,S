This is not really related to linux kernel development. But to answer it
requires certain expertise on Linux knowledge. Please allow me to ask
here. My problem is as following. I deinstalled win2k by brutforcely
removed windows directory. There are many files left on my C: root
directory. I made a copy of them and delete files except those ones
essential to MSDOS/win98. Now I cannot boot into win98.
Fortunately I installed dual boot. I can boot into Linux still. Works
fine. This suggests Partition table is ok. When I try to use Lilo, it says
that /dev/hda1 boot sector damaged. 
My question is: is there any tools under Linux that can automatically
repair such kinda of disk failure and recover the windows98 system
(someone needs it to send email coz I got a motorola soft modem). I know I
can do it by "dd" and partition table correction. Just wonder if there is
such a cool software that does the job already. 
Please send your answer to my email addr. I procmailed this email list...
Thanks a lot!

P.S. any bios function call C library available for Linux? That way, I
might just write code myself to do it? Or do I have to start from assembly
code? :-\
