Hello, Linus,
This message starts set of 8 patches against your current BK tree to
include reiser4.
Changes to the core code are fairly small and trivial: mostly function
exports, plus one patch to share ->journal_info pointer with Ext3.
All patches are available at 
http://namesys.com/snapshots/2002.10.31/,
they can be applied in any order.
Utilities, including mkfs.reiser4 are available at
http://namesys.com/snapshots/2002.10.31/reiser4progs-0.1.0.tar.gz
Nikita.
