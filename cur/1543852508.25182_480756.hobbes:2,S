Probably your drives are renamed.
Before you had (wild guess, look at your boot log messages):
- ata bus -> hdc,hdd
- sata -> sda (if you really have any sata bus...)
Now all hdX become sdX, and PATA is detected _before_ SATA, so you names
probaly became:
- ata via libata -> sda (HD), sr0 (CDROM)
- sata -> sdb.
So boot with root=/dev/sda. And don't forget to update lilo/grub config.
And /dev/cdrom links if udev doesn't.
Hope this helps.
PD: It would be very nice if libata had some parameter like 'sata_before_pata=1'
or the like...
