  drivers/acpi/sleep/proc.c: In function `acpi_system_write_sleep':
  drivers/acpi/sleep/proc.c:72: error: void value not ignored as it
  ought to be
  make[3]: *** [drivers/acpi/sleep/proc.o] Error 1
  make[2]: *** [drivers/acpi/sleep] Error 2
  make[1]: *** [drivers/acpi] Error 2
  make: *** [drivers] Error 2
Is there an incremental patch from -pm1 to -pm2?
