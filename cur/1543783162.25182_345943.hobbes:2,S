Did anything critical change from -rc7 to 2.6.13?
I had -rc7 running on three machines for:
> 1 week 
> 3 days
> 2 days
Respectively...
I upgraded to 2.6.13 this morning and only in less than 6 hours the machine locked up, I am not home at the moment so I cannot verify what happened; but nobody was doing anything when the crash occurred.
I will mention that in 2.6.12 the box would lock (and another as well) if you put a 400GB Seagate HDD on a Promise ATA/133 controller; however, 2.6.13-rc7 seemed to have the fix and I have not experienced any problems with it.  However, was some cold reverted back to an earlier version from -rc7 -> 2.6.13, or?
Any comments?
Thanks.
