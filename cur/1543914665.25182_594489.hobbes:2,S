Hi Alexander,
Attached patch adds const modifiers to a few struct nls_table's
member pointers in include/linux/nls.h and adds a lot
of const's in fs/nls/*.c files.
Resulting changes as visible by size:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
 113612  481216    2368  597196   91ccc nls.org/built-in.o
 593548    3296     288  597132   91c8c nls/built-in.o
Apparently compiler managed to optimize code a bit better
because of const-ness.
No other changes are made.
Patch is compile-tested with .config with all in-tree filesystems
selected.
Please send it Linuswards.
