Alan,
Thanks for running these numbers as well. I don't think you have to
bother with it more. My main concern was a performance regression,
increasing the overhead of running blktrace. So while we (well, you :-))
could run more tests, I'd say the above is Good Enough for me. Mathieu,
you can add my Acked-by: Jens Axboe <jens.axboe@oracle.com> to the
blktrace part of your marker series.
I do wonder about that performance _increase_ with blktrace enabled. I
remember that we have seen and discussed something like this before,
it's still a puzzle to me...
