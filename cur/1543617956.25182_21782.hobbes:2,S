Why don't we all follow the MSCommit method of VM? We simply allocate 99% 
of physical RAM for cache and other non-userspace purposes, and whenever an 
application needs memory, pop up a message:
         printk("Your system is out of virtual memory. Linux is increasing 
your virtual memory size. During this time, memory allocation requests may 
fail.\n");
Then spend a few minutes doing hard disk I/O, while exposing bugs in 
programs that don't check to make sure that malloc succeeded.
