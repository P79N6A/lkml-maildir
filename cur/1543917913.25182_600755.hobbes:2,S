Given that e.g. ICH8 only has 3 HPET timers that seems doubtful
except for the special case of single-socket non hyper threaded dual core.
You'll probably do a lot of broadcasting and IPI'ing still.
Also you'll likely make user space unhappy which often requires 
at least one free HPET timer for /dev/rtc. Ok I suppose that 
could be replaced with a hrtimer.
