How about a LIFO list for each processor where preempted (count != 0) tasks
go?
When a preemption occurs the current goes to the LIFO.
When a process has run whole of its time slot - it can be moved to an usedup
queue. (No point in keeping it on the generic run queue, but remember
it when giving out new ticks, could also be on a per CPU basis).
Now select what to do next..
The first on the LIFO can be moved in as "current" before checking the rest
of the run queue...
Pros:
+ The LIFO will be sorted with highest prio on top - no need to search 'em all
+ a process that starts a time slot on one CPU stays the whole slot.
Cons:
- A process might get stuck waiting for the processor in the FIFO while the
  other CPU is idle (but that was the point, wasn't it...)
