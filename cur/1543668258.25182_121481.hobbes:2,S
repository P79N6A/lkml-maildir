Well, yes and no. I looked at the code, and decided that the memleak fix 
was hottibly bogus.
Look at how the allocations are done inside the loop: they are INSIDE A 
LOOP.
Look at what happens with the memory leak fix if the loop fails after
having done <n> iterations: it will only unregister the last (failing)
iteration, but it will then free stuff that the earlier (successful)
iterations still depend on.

I assume it's for *BSD.

Only if _you_ are willing to sync the DRM tree. 
Since I'm only doing the DRM syncs occasionally, I want to keep 
unnecessary differences between the kernel and DRM to a minimum. Which 
means that I do remove gunk that I find stupid and ugly (I've removed 
#ifdef's in the code before), but not stuff that looks like reasonable 
compatibility stuff.

Ehh.. I _did_ go through the other lines, and was actually involved with 
one of the more spread-out changes (ie suggesting the fixed locking 
context thing). As far as I can tell the patch is good. I'd still like 
more eyes on the result, but the eyes should look a bit more closely..
