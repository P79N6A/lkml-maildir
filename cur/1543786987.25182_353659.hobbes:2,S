The purpose of MSI is to bypass the IO APIC.
I'm not aware of any dependency on IO APIC in HW.
I suspect the dependency in the Kconfig is historical
because of how the x86 source code is structured:
config X86_LOCAL_APIC
        bool
        depends on X86_UP_APIC || ((X86_VISWS || SMP) && !X86_VOYAGER)
        default y
essentially, LOCAL_APIC gets enabled if "UP_APIC or SMP".
I've no clue why folks thought it was better to ignore
the IO APIC on UP kernels.
I'm pretty sure one only needs a local APIC support.
Local APIC responds to 0xfee00000 range of addresses and
directs the interrupt to a CPU.

UP vs SMP is orthogonal to MSI support wrt HW.
I suppose this is another historical artifact of
APICs being used with SMP x86 boxes first.
