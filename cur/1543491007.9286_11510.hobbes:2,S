You know, he was talking about the distributions and not the kernel
itself.  People tend to refer to RedHat's or other's distributions as
"Linux"* when in fact "Linux"* refers only to the kernel.  Stallman only
wants the growing number of RedHat users and Debian users and SuSE users
etc. to realize the fact that there is a lot more to a distribution than
just the kernel, and that large, important parts of most distributions is
GNU.  So calling a Slackware CD "Linux" is technically incorrect (not that
that will stop anybody from doing it).
[By the way, feel free to delete everything from your system that says
"GNU" when you do --version, if you don't like it.]
