Resending the mail, since i have not received a copy of that...
Sorry if ypu are receiving duplicate copies.
Hi All,
Sorry for disturbing the list again.
I am using RTL8139C in our target board which is based on MIPS
IDT32334 processor.
The version of 8139too.c that i am using is 1.0.1 where as I am
using a embedded linux which is based on Linux Kernel
2.4.5-pre1.
When the packet is transmitted out, it is coming out as all
0's(captured using sniffer). I dumped the whole packet in
rtl8139_start_xmit (). The packet is a valid ARP packet.
My doubt is whether this 8139too.c is tested with MIPS 
processors?
Because in one of the article i found that the supported
processors are ARM, i386 etc.
Can any body throw some light on this?
with best regards,
Nanda
