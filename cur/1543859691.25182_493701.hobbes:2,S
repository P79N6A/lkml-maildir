Jens, elapsed time for `mke2fs /dev/hdc5' with the anticipatory scheduler
(at least) has gone from nine seconds to sixty as a result of the recent
block merge.
This is the enty enth time that block code has been slammed into mainline
without having had exposure to -mm testers or even to me personally, and it
it the second time (at least) that obvious regressions have occurred as a
result.  I have a New Year's resolution for you ;)
