Hi,
currently (2.6.16-rc1 and possible -rcX), the Kconfig help text for autofs4 
reads as follows:
    The automounter is a tool to automatically mount remote file
    systems on demand. This implementation is partially kernel-based to
    reduce overhead in the already-mounted case; this is unlike the BSD
    automounter (amd), which is a pure user space daemon.
But obviously I can use autofs4 with local filesystems,
that is, CDROM, too.
