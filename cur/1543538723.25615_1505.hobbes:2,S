No.  phys_to_virt(8192) != trampoline_base, at least in the general case.
It really looks like the code in smpboot.c is out of date to me.

This doesn't seem to happen in practice.  If it does, we probably want to
panic() anyway - we now have a random CPU executing random code but not
behaving as expected.
