Ah OK, it's not even the mailer, it's me. I read the message and did not
notice the attachment, just the inline patch. Then I forwarded it to my
work address and lost the attachment. You know the rest ...

Good advice. Or manually edit the directory name in the diff to
explicitly show what it refers to. Eg:
--- linux-2.6.16-sched7/kernel/sched.c	2006-03-27 06:11:01.000000000 +0200
+++ linux-2.6.16/kernel/sched.c	2006-03-30 10:50:46.000000000 +0200
Anyway, thanks for your reply, I'll re-apply it and recompile.
