Subject: Help me to hack on the task_struct

When hacking with my module code: 
I do not get reasonable results when using the "current"  macro to access 
parts of the task structure.
Things seem to diverge past a thing called rlim in the task_struct..
There are supposedly RLIM_NLIMITS of these rlims.
So I looked through that wonderful cross reference at sourceforge
to discover these defined in resource.h:
#define RLIMIT_CPU      0               /* CPU time in ms */
#define RLIMIT_FSIZE    1               /* Maximum filesize */
#define RLIMIT_DATA     2               /* max data size */
#define RLIMIT_STACK    3               /* max stack size */
#define RLIMIT_CORE     4               /* max core file size */
#define RLIMIT_RSS      5               /* max resident set size */
#define RLIMIT_NPROC    6               /* max number of processes */
#define RLIMIT_NOFILE   7               /* max number of open files */
#define RLIMIT_MEMLOCK  8               /* max locked-in-memory address space 
*/
#define RLIMIT_AS       9               /* address space limit */
#define RLIMIT_LOCKS    10              /* maximum file locks held */
#define RLIM_NLIMITS    11
Questions:
Why do resource limits happen to count sequencially?
And can I expect the task structure in sched.h to conform to the compiled
kernel?
With my SUSE 8.1 linux. I am using 2.4.19 in my headers and 2.4.19GB in the
runnitg kernel. (Insmod bitches a little)
Any clues are appreciated.
