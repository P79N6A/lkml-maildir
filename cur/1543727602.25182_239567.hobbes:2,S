Ok, it was a "too hot hotfix". Your solution is better (but see below).

Good.

copy_page sometimes changes struct task_struct, does copy, changes it
back. That makes it bad choice for copying task_structs,
unfortunately. Do you want me to retransmit the patch?

If i386 got it wrong, it is possible that other architectures get it
wrong, too. Fixing i386 is good, but we should not risk continuing
machine with valid image on disk.
I guess "device_power_up / local_irq_restore" should be replaced with
BUG() or while(1)?
