By the way, FYI:  The Chelsio T3 device support is split into 2 driver
modules: the Ethernet driver and the RDMA driver.  The Ethernet driver
lives in drivers/net/cxgb3 while the RDMA driver lives in
drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb3.  The Ethernet driver can be used
stand-alone as a 10GbE high-performance NIC driver.  The RDMA driver has
a config-time dependency on the Ethernet driver.
The 2nd version of the Ethernet driver was posted yesterday.  See:
