I'll hopefull commit these patches this weekend, I'm at a conference
currently so not really able to do a lot of work.  If you need to make
more progress until than just apply the hunk that introduces sched_flags
before doing your patch.

There is no difference in impact between marking a function non-static
and adding a trivial wrapper around it, only that the latter creates
more bloat.  So I don't think there's a good argument against this.
