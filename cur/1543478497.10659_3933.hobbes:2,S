How about always allocate one cluster for FAT files, even if they are
zero length?  A waste, but not a big one.  
If msdos or some such created a zero-length FAT-file - allocate the
cluster when the attempt is made to get the inode number.
This won't work with a read-only mounted filesystem shared with msdos
though.  Linus idea with a counter may be useful in that case, just
restrict the range so where it won't overlap with real inode numbers.
