Yeah yeah yeah.  What I meant was "you don't have to use ide-scsi."  However,
after reading the notes for the latest cdrecord, it does use ide-scsi.  In
theory, it doesn't _have_ to as you can send packet commands directly to
CD-ROM devices (ide disks and floppies, saddly cannot -- how the f*** am
I supposed to format a floppy?)
There are specific notes about the HP 7100 drives not working corectly due
to bad command translations.  That was supposed to have been fixed years
ago.
