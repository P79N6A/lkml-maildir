Investment Offer From Joseph Otisa
Compliments of the season, my name is Mr. Joseph Otisa, the branch manager of AllstatesTrust Bank of Nigeria plc Lagos State Branch.  
I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank (Mr.wahab Daniel) with account number ATS 1022002-109 who perished with his family in an auto crash in Abuja expresway, in Nigeria, on the 30th of November 2000.
Since the demise of Mr. Daniel, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of usd6.23m, six million, two hundred and thirty thousand united states dollars] has been with our bank here for a very long time, which has accumulated some interest. on this note I decided to seek for you, your name shall be used as the next of kin, as no one has come up to put claim as the next of kin to this funds and the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than five years, becuase after five years the money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bill..
I am convinced in my mind that your name could be used as the next of kin to this claim. The request of the foreigner as a next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as the next of kin to a foreigner.
I have agreed to share this money with you in the mutual understanding of 70%/30%.you keep 30% while I keep 70%, thereafter I will visit your country, for disbursement as I am almost due for retirement. Therefore to endeavour the immediate transfer of this funds to your account, you have to apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the deceased indicating by sending an application and location where the money will be remitted.
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as the whole required arrangement as been perfected for the transfer.
I want to make you this offer, ( joeoti7@swissinfo.org ) this is my private email address do not hesitate to reply me through this email address if you are interested.
Kind regards.
