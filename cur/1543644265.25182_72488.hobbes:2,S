I noticed that the pgrp-related behaviour of some programs changed.
Some programs hang, some programs loop. The hang occurs when they
are stopped by SIGTTOU. The infinite loop occurs when they catch SIGTTOU
(and the same signal is sent immediately again when they leave the
signal routine).
Have not yet investigated details.
