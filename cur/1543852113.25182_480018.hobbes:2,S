I think I may have planted the idea that you could get i_blkbits from
sb->s_blocksize_bits, but I was wrong.  Consider a block device.  It's
blocksize is not related to the superblock of its containing filesystem.

They were never really related.  Some filesystems treated them as if
they were, but the vfs always used i_blkbits for the block size.
i_blksize was only really used for returning stat->blksize.

It would probably be best to just set stat->blksize to the negotiated
buffer size.
