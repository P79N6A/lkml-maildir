Which is obviously not the right way to go. I guess we agree in that.

Sorry, misunderstanding: I did not touch rsize/wsize. What I do is to lower fs
action by not letting knfsd walk through the subtrees of a mounted fs. This
leads to less allocs/frees by the fs layer which tend to fail and let knfs fail
afterwards.

This is one important part for sure.
