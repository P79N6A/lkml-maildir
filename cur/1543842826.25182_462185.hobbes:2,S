Hi folks,
aparently the 2.6.17.8 kernel or rather the lm_sensors package which is
part of this kernel does not recognize the on-board chips of this 
motherboard correctly. sensors-detect seems to find some chips, but
likely not the correct one as it seems. The corresponding entry in /proc
remains empty, though.
Is there any plan/idea how to support this motherboard?
Is there something I could provide/test to get it supported?
Thanks,
	Thomas
