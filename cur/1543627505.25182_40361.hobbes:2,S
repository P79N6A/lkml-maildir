You can get the same effect going via user space just fine, and the
performance of IDE is well below the point that should make a difference
since PCI bandwidth is likely to be your bottleneck.
mmap the capture buffers into a user application (eg video4linux api), then
write the files using the O_DIRECT option or a raw device (see rawctl and
friends)
