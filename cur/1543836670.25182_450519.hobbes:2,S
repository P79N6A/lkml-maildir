at least as a optional mode of operation yes.
I'm sure someone will want/need the existing 'update atime immediatly', and 
there are people who don't care about atime at all (and use noatime), but there 
is a large middle ground between them where atime is helpful, but doesn't need 
the real-time update or crash protection.
