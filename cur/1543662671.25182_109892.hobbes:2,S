True.

I am an Adelaide local and I could organise it, however I am also
organising "educationaLinux 2004" (the Australian annual educational
Linux conference thing). I could direct both but I don't want to spread
myself too thinly.

That's a point. However there seems to be so much one could talk about,
discuss and learn about the Linux kernel that you could easily spend the
whole _week_ on it alone.

Or we could carefully pitch the "Mini Conference" to people who were
technical people who understand kernel code [i.e. make it a really,
really technical thing] and the conference at a slightly lesser, but
still technical, level.
