I added it, but it doesn't appear to have helped. Setting X to use the
fbdev driver works as expected, but isn't as purty once loaded :-(
Here's the relevant section of XF86Config:
Section "Device"
        Identifier  "Videocard0"
        Driver      "neomagic"
        VendorName  "Videocard vendor"
        BoardName   "NeoMagic MagicMedia 256AV (laptop/notebook)"
        VideoRam    2560
        Option      "OverlayMem" "829440"
        Option      "UseFBDev" "1"
        Option      "externDisp" ""
        Option      "internDisp" ""
EndSection
However, the following now appears in XFree86.0.log:
