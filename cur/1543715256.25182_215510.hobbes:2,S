Yes, that is their major discovery.  You need to guess the ports
and source/destination addresses as well, which is why I don't
consider this such a serious issue personally.
It is mitigated if timestamps are enabled, because that becomes
another number you have to guess.
It is mitigated also by randomized ephemeral port selection, which
OpenBSD implements and we could easily implement as well.
I'm very happy that OpenBSD checked in a fix for this a week or so
ago and took some of the thunder out of this bogusly hyped announcement.
