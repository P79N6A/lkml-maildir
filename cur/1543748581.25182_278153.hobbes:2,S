[RFC]  Has there been previously any thought of adding priority
inheriting wait queues. With the IRQs that run as threads, have hooks in
the code that allows a driver or socket layer to attach a thread to a
wait queue, and when a RT priority task waits on the queue, a function
is call to increase (if needed) the priority of the attached thread. I
know that this would take some work, and would make the normal kernel
and RT diverge more, but it would really help to solve the problem of a
high priority process waiting for an interrupt that can be starved by
other high priority processes.
Just a thought.
