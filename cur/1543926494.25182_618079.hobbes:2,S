Hi Lucy,
sorry but i don't have the other usb-to-serial models to test them too, i guess
you're in the position to do that :) Well, from what i've unterstood from
reading the code, you can still do the keyspan_send_setup() call since the
switch-case-statement is not handling the 19s series so while this call won't have any
influence on them, it'll still init the others properly, no? Anyway, you can send me your
fix for testing.
Thanks.
