Ohhh, interesting.
So the original patch has:
#define BAD_ADDR(x) ((unsigned long)(x) >= TASK_SIZE)
For some reason(?) it got changed to the clearly buggy:
#define BAD_ADDR(x) ((unsigned long)(x) >= PAGE_MASK)
Jiri's patch undoes that second buggy define, which is very
different from the original that was sent in by you and Ernie.
