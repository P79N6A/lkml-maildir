Yeah, I did that a while ago, but I don't want to give my acked-by or
signed-off for this code.  While I can not find anything specfically
wrong with it, it seems a bit "odd", but that might just be because I
really don't understand what they are doing here, or why.
And no, I really don't want to understand it either at the moment due to
being busy with other things :)
thanks,
