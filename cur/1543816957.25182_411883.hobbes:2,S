Hi. Does anyone now, what has happend. Since kernel 2.6.14 I experience
problems with kernel:
1) I have tvtuner (SAA7134). When switching channels, sound disappear
for a while and then appear (I think that problem is in trying to found
stereo), using 2.6.12 it's OK
2) My IR (on tvtuner) work worse (have delay,before it begin to react
on keypress)
All my suspicions are on i2c
