Okay, so in fact you don't know.
And that's my point in this thread.
I won't fight for the freezer for what it's worth, but let's do things in the
_right_ _order_.  For example, let's make sure that by making the $subject
change we won't introduce (too many) regressions and fix the frameworks
that don't get it right.
Using the problems with FUSE as an argument for making this change immediately
doesn't seem to be right to me.

Yes, but that's another issue.
