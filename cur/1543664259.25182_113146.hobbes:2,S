The work I did here was inconclusive but _suggested_ (non-rigorously)
that FNV was merely more expensive with little benefit for the most
straightforward hash function replacement strategy.
More intelligent mixing strategies for parent + child names etc. may
reveal some use for it yet, but I have zero results in that area.
There is much room for experimentation AFAICT.
