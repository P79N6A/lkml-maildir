This is inconsistent with your earlier comment "for anything else
crypto related it just doesn't cut the corner". So are you retracting
that statement?

I'm fairly confident that a user on the system can't tamper with my
mouse movements and keyboard presses. As for other interrupt sources
(such as network, disc and so on) which may be vulnerable to
"tampering" (i.e. injection or monitoring of timing data), that's why
we have the concept of "entropy". Think of it as a measure of trust.

This is a completely flawed argument. The more entropy inputs there
are, the harder it is for an attacker to predict or control all of
them.

This doesn't make sense. If, as you say, something is better against
cryptographic attacks, then the overall security of the system is
better. A trivially obvious example is TCP.

The flaw is in your argument, which isn't logical, and uses
hand-waving in place of coherent step-by-step analysis of how
/dev/random is somehow harmful to security. Use of a few choice words
in uppercase isn't convincing. Furthermore, you talk about a risk to
system security, but you don't even clearly define what you mean be
that.
