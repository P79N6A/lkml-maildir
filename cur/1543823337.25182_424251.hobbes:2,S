Pardon; my wording was overly harsh, but I still want to point out  
that assuming an unresponsive MAINTAINERS entry indicates that the  
person doesn't care is totally wrong.  Given the volume of email a  
lot of these people receive, it's very easy for it to go unnoticed or  
be trapped by a spam filter.  Publishing to the LKML is virtually  
always OK; even if you have a security problem, the average  
turnaround for "critical" security fixes like theoretical local root  
exploits is around 24 hours or so.  We went through about 8 stable  
"releases" over the course of a little more than a week because of  
several fairly urgent security fixes during that time.

As I said above, even the LKML is probably ok if you think you've  
found an actual explot.  If you really feel nervous about exposing  
it, I believe there's a security@kernel.org email where you can send  
such information which will even tenatively agree to a coordinated  
disclosure if you can prove that it's an urgent security problem.
Cheers,
