hm, i like it, and added it to my queue (probably .24 material though), 
but note that it increases .text and .data overhead:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  41028   37794    2168   80990   13c5e sched.o.before
  41349   37826    2168   81343   13dbf sched.o.after
is that expected?
