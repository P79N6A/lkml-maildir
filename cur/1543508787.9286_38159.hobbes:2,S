Bad idea. 
Several things that change the names have been tried before, Prefix dots
for hidden for example; they just don't work well. And as for putting
the archive bit in the name, a filename should not change just because
you touch it!
When you get down to it the S and H bits are a _lot_ like group ids in
concept; how would you describe the S bit ? ... "A flag that marks the
files that are special to the system" ... or perhaps "A field that marks
the _group_ of files that are special to the system"

It's used as a Unicode seperator with VFAT.

The point is this is the method used by Windows and it's a small enough
subset of the possible methods to represent in this way. If you've got
a file that has a strange shortname then it wasn't created by windows
so even for windows it's shortname is probably irrelevent. But I don't
really like the idea of putting the shortname in the gid anyway.

Yes I suggested this in a message with the subject "Your backup is broken"
but while it's great for backups it's a royal pain to use plus you end up
again with files that change name when you write to them. And as for 
symlinks; don't go there.

'vfat_set/get_short_name()' is a reasonable interface for saving
shortnames that don't match a simple algorithm (eg number 1 or number
0 in my list)

This is part of the problem; having the backup do a remount, or worse
having the user remember to do it is very ugly indeed. If it can't be
done (somebody is left logged in) your backup is ****ed. Much better
to have a program that scans the disk for unusual files and records
their oddness (SYSbits, ~87 shortname etc).
