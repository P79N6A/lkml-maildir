When you OOM, it's (typically) the case where it's a single process that's
going crazy and being a huge memory hog.  Killing other processes ahead
of it won't typically mean very much, as you'll have to kill more until
you finally get to the spiraling-out-of-control memory hog.
If the case isn't this clear-cut, though, I think killing by pid
(highest->lowest) may be a decent hueristic since the most important
processes (init, loggers, etc) tend to be long-running ones started
early so they maintain pid's < 100.
