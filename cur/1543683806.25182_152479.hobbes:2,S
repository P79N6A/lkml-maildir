Oh, plz...
Then why are we all calling current kernel 2.4.22 instead of 2.4.21.90 ?
(thing that I would prefer...) ?
OK, the full name would be gcc-3.3.1-prerelease-of-20030720.
But the version comes from the gcc people, the distro did not choose it.
It is clear if it is the 3.4 or the 3.3.1 branch.
If gcc people has decided to deprecate a feature, live with it and
correct the kernel source. Same happened with multiline string literals.
This is no strange compiler, it is just the next gcc you will see.
