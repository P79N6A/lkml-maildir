Yes, it still violates the standard, intend was to not do so.
And to stick to the 8/9 bytes.
The X has the same meaning as your suggestion below, starting with LNX,
it should be visible that it is an out of spec, linux only hid.

Don't know what is better, the first solution looks nicer...
Just tell me the final suggestion and I redo the patch.

PS: What is your general impression of the patches, will you add the
next series to acpi-test?
Shall I wait for some other patch(es) and then rebase, this one touches
nearly every file in /drivers/acpi/*.c and could end up in some merge
work for me or others.
