	The only GOOD time to bounce is at SMTP reception
	into VGER, not latter.  It doesn't have facilities
	to do all what Majordomo taboo filters do now.
	(Just because I have been lazy and haven't done
	 any such content filters for vger.)
	With ECN on, emailed bounce messages won't (necessarily)
	make it to the sender at all.
	Majordomo's filter bounces the message to be approved
	by list owner -- who usually uses the 'D' key to my
	knowledge.
