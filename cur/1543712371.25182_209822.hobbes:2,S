    Hi all :)
    I have a printer connected thru my parallel port, supported in
the kernel by parport+parport_pc+lp:
kernel: parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778), irq 7 [PCSPP,TRISTATE]
kernel: parport0: Printer, Lexmark International Lexmark Optra E312
kernel: lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven).
kernel: lp0: console ready
    It works ok, BTW... The problem is that, when the printer is
switched of and I try to print something, the print command just
blocks, no error, no messages, nothing. I use a shell function to
print, which sends a control command to the printer and after that
sends the file I want to print. It stops (forever) at the reset
command, something like "echo -n '\eE' > /dev/printer".
    Why this operation doesn't fail? IMHO, it should fail with
ENODEV, because parport can work (the parallel port is there...), but
lp shouldn't (the printer is switched off...).
    BTW, I would swear I have the parallel port configured as EPP+ECP
with DMA3 and irq 7 :??? Why is it detected as PCSPP?
    Any help? Thanks in advance :)
