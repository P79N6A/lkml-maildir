Absolutely agreed.  Nobody likes maintaining hundreds of
patches for multiple versions of a distribution, especially
not the companies that pay the salary of the programmers
tied up doing that kind of work ;)
There are sound economic reasons why Linux companies should
merge their stuff back into the upstream kernel;  or better 
yet, develop the functionality in the upstream kernel before
merging it into the distribution tree (eg. NPTL, selinux
enhancements, O(1) scheduler).
Maintaining a patch for one version of the distribution, in
order to get a feature to customers sooner, is perfectly
doable and may make economic sense.
Maintaining an out-of-tree patch forever because you didn't
get around to merging it into the upstream kernel doesn't.
It is nothing but a waste of effort, doing the same work
over and over again for every version of the product, instead
of doing the work once and then focussing your engineers on
implementing new functionality.
Yes, this is a hint at certain embedded developers.  You
know who you are and chances are you also know what you would
like to develop if you no longer had to spend your time porting
the same old patches from one version of the product to the next.
