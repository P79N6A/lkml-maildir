Hi Greg,
you may want to add:
"Linux Kernel Development, 2nd ed." by Robert Love [Novell Press]
and
"Linux Device Drivers, 3rd ed." by J. Corbet, A. Rubini and G. Kroah-Hartman [O'Reilly]
IMHO the first one is a must-have for beginners who want to have an
overall picture of the kernel and LDD is very helpful when you start doing
some real work :)
