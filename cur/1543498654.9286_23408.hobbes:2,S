Hello,
For some reason, SOMETHING (for the lack of a better word) seems to be
changing the permissions and ownership of certain files under /dev on my
system.
The affected devices include audio, radio, floppy, joystick and a few
others (midi*, audio*, radio*, js*, fd[01]*, vcs[24], vcsa[24], hdc,
console, dsp*, fb*).
As far as I understand the whole permissions thing, no process run by a
normal user should be able to changes the permissions of these files, and
yet the changes still occur.
A few examples (where "fullung" is my username):
crw-------   1 fullung  sys       14,   3 Jun 10 05:34 dsp
crw-------   1 fullung  root      29,   0 Jun 10 05:38 fb0
brw-------   1 fullung  disk      22,   0 Jun 10 05:34 hdc
crw-------   1 fullung  root      81,  64 Jun 10 05:41 radio0
crw-------   1 fullung  sys       14,   1 Jun 10 05:34 sequencer
The permission and ownership changes occur at random times when I am
using the system. I'm not running any setuid binaries of any sort.
I do use X most of time (and I log in with xdm).
The reason this presents a problem is that, after I log out, these devices
are rendered unaccessible to other users until I log in as root and repair
the "damage" with MAKEDEV and mknod.
I'm running Red Hat 6.0 (fully errata'd) with kernel 2.2.9. The redhat.com
Knowledge Base doesn't seem to have any references to similiar problems.
Any help and/or suggestions would be appreciated.
Regards,
Albert
