depmod/modinfo/insmod/modprobe already know it. And quite honnestly,
I don't know about any other program which really needs to process
those files once installed. Well, maybe ksymoops, but I'd have to
check, as I don't recall having ever been annoyed with this.

I'm not that sure. At most it might want to uncompress them to gain some
space, but someone who uses compressed modules for later use in an initrd
is probably missing something.
