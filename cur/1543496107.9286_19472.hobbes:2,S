Actually, a pretty good quick and easy spam blocker is to throw everything
that does not contain your e-mail address in To: or CC: in a "Possible Spam?"
folder.  Make sure that this is your last filter after any filters to sort
mailing lists.  Essentially this will throw anything that was BCC'd to you
into that folder.  Spammer's usually will send you stuff BCC'd so they won't
give away their email lists.
