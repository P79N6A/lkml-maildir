Interesting you mention it. A week ago I started a thread exactly for
that reason; I implemented GIMPs tilemanagement using mmap but
unfortunately the performance sucks even more than GIMPs "clever" 
swapping. That having said it has at least one more severe disadvantage:
The maximum amount of mmapable memory is far less than the maximum
filesize with large file support.
