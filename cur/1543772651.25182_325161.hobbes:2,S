Hmm. Does not quite work here:
scsi0: Starting DV
scsi0 : Adaptec AIC79XX PCI-X SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 1.3.11
        <Adaptec 29320 Ultra320 SCSI adapter>
        aic7902: Ultra320 Wide Channel A, SCSI Id=7, PCI 33 or 66Mhz,
512 SCBs
In DV Thread
scsi0: Beginning Domain Validation
scsi0:A:0:0: Performing DV
scsi0:2223: Going from state 0 to state 1
scsi0:A:0:0: Sending INQ
scsi0: Timeout while doing DV command 12.
And from there all hell breaks loose.
It looks as if it simply refuses to send any commands ...
Investigating.
Cheers,
Hannes
