I've merged the simple bits of this by hand with my serial CVS.  As I
said in a previous mail here, I'm not taking on the maintainence of the
existing serial.c driver.  Therefore, these comments apply to the
new serial driver, not the existing drivers.

Not applied.
These two I'd rather waited until we've got the driver merged into 2.5,
at which point I'd rather have a patch against the new driver.

I don't actually printk() the serial ports that have been discovered at
boot time in the new serial CVS.  If people scream enough, I could be
persuaded.  I'm currently of the opinion that they're noise, and if
we're really interested in them, we've got a userspace tool to do it
for us: setserial -bg /dev/ttyS*

Only the MULTISERIAL support applied - 2.4 has the PCI class definitions,
so when the new driver is merged, we already have the definitions.
