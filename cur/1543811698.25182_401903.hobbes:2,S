Unfortunately, I can't seem to find a way to force it to use hpet. Passing 
'notsc' and 'nopmtimer' I end up using PIT/TSC based timekeeping. TSC is 
already known to have problems with dual core. But I will sit with it for a 
while to see if it fairs better than the pm timer.
Bill, What timer do you use, and do these lost ticks persist after sata_nv 
interrupts stop?
