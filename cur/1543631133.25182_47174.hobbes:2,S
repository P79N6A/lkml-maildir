Hi,
I tried to enable the vertical retrace interrupt of my
AGP card by setting the value of a related register.
The document about this register mentions that" The
fields in this register control whether the respective
status bits are enabled to drive the system interrupt
pin. Even if enabled here, the interrupt line is not
driven unless enabled in the PCI configuration space."
Can we enable interrupt in PCI configuration space? If
we can, how to enable it? By the way, I am not in this
maillist. Could you please send a copy to me when you
give your suggestion.
Thanks in advance,
jing
