I don't care what folks did for ages, I care what I think is best to do
_now_ with linux, and I don't see why one should go with RTOS when much
simpler and more reliable and _more_performant_ solutions exists when
switching to linux, even for the printers.

Those are sort of problems where metal-hard may be simpler to deal with,
if there's a skip they'll record a second time, and you can just use
measurement and proabability there, without providing any guarantee.
Perhaps you can't handle valid criticism cause you have a conflict of
interest.
