Thought about that and querying power state before doing shutdown 
sequence but things get somewhat ugly because shutdown sequence is 
driven from sd->shutdown().  We'll have to snoop both sync and shutdown 
commands and check whether the system is shutting down.  Also, I felt 
very uneasy about faking successful completion to SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE.
I dunno.  It's already too late for 2.6.21.  I was hoping we could get 
distros to update shutdown utilities in not-too-distant future but I 
have no experience with that.  Is that just a wishful thinking?
