should i compile all 'offending' modules into the kernel?

sorry, i should have been clearer. i am actually changing the link
depending on whether the it8212 controller is enabled in the bios. if
enabled, cdrom is /dev/hdh (dvd is /dev/hdg). if not enabled, cdrom/dvd is
/dev/hdc and hdd. the links are correct, and like i mentioned in the
initial post, i can mount data cds/dvds with no issues whether the
controller is enabled or not. it almost sounds like it thinks the cd and
dvd drives are hard drives and treating them as such. is there perhaps some
additional parameter that should be passed to the kernel on boot, perhaps
with ide-cdrom or similar??
thanks again for responding.
