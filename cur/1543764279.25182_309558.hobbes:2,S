yeah, that shouldnt be a problem. Technically we set cpus_allowed up 
under the tasklist lock just to be non-preemptible and to copy the 
parent's _current_ affinity to the child. But sched_fork() is called 
just before and if the parent got its affinity changed between the two 
calls, so what? I'd move all of this code into sched_fork().

sure, that was the plan all along with sched_fork() anyway. (i think the 
initial versions had the flag)

sure, fine by me.
