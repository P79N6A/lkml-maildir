In 2.2 you can increase the per-socket buffers via sysctl. Check out 
/proc/sys/net/core/[rw]mem_{default,max}. The kernel will never use
a window larger than 1/2 of the total available memory for the socket,
hence the 32k default window. It will however use all the available
memory for the queue when sending.
The number following wscale in tcpdump is the power of two by which 
the window will be multiplied. So the real window is 
    2 ^ wscale * window
with wscale and window as seen by tcpdump.
With the 2.2 defaults I can get up to 45k/s over a 600+ ping time 
connection. By increasing the memory limits on _both_ the sender 
and the receiver I've been able to get over 200k/s over the same link.
