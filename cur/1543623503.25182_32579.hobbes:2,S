I think you're right.  To prevent the mistake from
happening again, I'd suggest you add a comment to your
patch for init_idle(), explaining that it can't be __init 
because it is called by cpu_idle, which is called
by rest_init(), which ...
I wonder if an automated __init consistency checker 
would be helpful.
