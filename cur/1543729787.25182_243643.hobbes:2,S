If you let me gloat for a little bit, ub makes this discussion moot
because it has no helper thread. But getting back to usb-storage,
here's the actual bug:
 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=130326
As you can see, it's muddled considerably. The original report
has no useful information, but if you look into an obscure but hefty
attachement, you see this:

This is what made me suspect that it's the diry memory writeout problem.
It's just like how it was on 2.4 before Alan added PF_MEMALLOC.
