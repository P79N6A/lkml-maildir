Subject: [PATCH 22 of 39] IB/ipath - fix lost interrupts on HT-400
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/29/391

Do an extra check to see if in-memory tail changed while processing
packets, and if so, going back through the loop again (but only once
per call to ipath_kreceive()).   In practice, this seems to be enough
to guarantee that if we crossed the clearing of an interrupt at start of
ipath_intr with a scheduled tail register update, that we'll process the
"extra" packet that lost the interrupt because we cleared it just as it
was about to arrive.
