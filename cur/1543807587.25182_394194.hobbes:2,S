As I say, it's a problem which needs fixing elsewhere.  What if
the process was called:
\nSystem Halted\n
(which will fit in the kernel's process name.)  Or maybe some escape
sequence which reprograms your terminal.
As I say, this is a problem which needs solving by other means.  Maybe
flush_old_exec() should be a little more careful about what it copies,
changing non-alphanumeric characters to '?' ?
