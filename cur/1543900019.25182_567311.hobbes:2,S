We have run mm kernels for month now without the need of a fallback. I 
purpose of ZONE_MOVABLE was to guarantee that higher order pages could be 
reclaimed and thus make the scheme reliable?
The experience so far shows that the approach works reliably. If there are 
issues then they need to be fixed. Putting in workarounds in other places 
such as in fsblock may just be hiding problems if there are any.
