How does can any of this even work?
Say I have N disks, mirrored, or maybe with parity. I'm trying
to have a reliable system. I change a file. The write goes out
to my disks, and power is lost. Some number M, such that 0<M<N,
of the disks are written before the power loss. The rest of the
disks don't complete the write. Maybe worse, this is more than
one sector, and some disks have partial writes.
Doesn't RAID need a journal or the phase-tree algorithm?
How does one tell what data is old and what data is new?
