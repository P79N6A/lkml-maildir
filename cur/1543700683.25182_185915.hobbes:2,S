Hey guys,
Some good news, I found the original libc-222 sources lying around,
looks like the real deal.  The user owning the files in the archive is
hlu so looks to be untouched, latest modification dates in the archive
are from late June 1992.  You can find it at:
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~stan/linux/libc-222.taz
(In case anyone has forgotten .taz is .tgz file)
Enjoy,
Stan Bubrouski
