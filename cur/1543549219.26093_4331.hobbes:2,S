Thank you Keith!
I simply deleted "__exit" from below in my
/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/rtc.c file
static void __exit rtc_exit (void)
{
        /* interrupts and maybe timer disabled at this point by
rtc_release */
        /* FIXME: Maybe??? */
        if (rtc_status & RTC_TIMER_ON) {
                spin_lock_irq (&rtc_lock);      <============
                rtc_status &= ~RTC_TIMER_ON;
                del_timer(&rtc_irq_timer);
                spin_unlock_irq (&rtc_lock);    <============
                printk(KERN_WARNING "rtc_exit(), and timer still
running.\n");
        }
I was afraid to compile as a module because Configuration Help in
xconfig for RTC  (real time clock) says:
If you run Linux on a multiprocessor machine and said Y to
"Symmetric Multi Processing" above, you should say Y here to read
and set the RTC in an SMP compatible fashion.
This says to me that in order to use RTC for SMP you must *not* build it
as a module.  So I opted to edit the file.
It seems to me that the only reason 2.4.0 had compiled before was
because I had RTC checked "no" before, I noticed this in my
configuration file that I load with xconfig and changed it to yes, hence
the problem showing up.
I wonder why I could compile an SMP kernel without RTC!?!  Maybe there
is a default overide that builds RTC in when SMP is checked yes.  Or
maybe it didn't really build an SMP kernel without RTC, I don't know.
Anyway, thanks again for your help.
Best Regards,
Armand
