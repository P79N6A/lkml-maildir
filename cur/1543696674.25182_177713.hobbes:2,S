Because each platform may wish to use different values
for these things as they are part of the user visible ABI.
For example, on Sparc we choose values which matched up closely
to what SunOS uses in order to make the compatability layer
for SunOS binaries easier to implement.
It just so happens that the bits are layed out on Sparc such
that we could only fit so many baud rate encodings, we didn't
have enough left to define one for B4000000.
You will notice that in the entire 2.6.x tree, ir-usb.c is the
only piece of code which makes reference to this value.
