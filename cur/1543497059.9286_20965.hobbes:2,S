But that's the beauty of Linux!  You get to choose what you want in the
kernel and recompile to your tastes.  You can even choose whether you want
modules or not, if you have RAM limitations also.  I don't think this is a
particularly good reason to limit what can go in the kernel.  You can make
the argument that distributions should not include it in the default kernel
image they provide, but you wouldn't be using a standard distribution in the
type of system you are talking about anyway.
I fail to see the logic here.
