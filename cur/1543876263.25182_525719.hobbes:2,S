Umm.. WHy not make the device tree look like this:
	    -- "clocksource" -- +-- HPET
				|
				+-- TSC
				|
				+-- i8259
				|
				+-- lapic timer
				|
				.. whatever else
and use the "struct device" that we *have* for this? The whole "struct 
device" is literally designed to do this, and to be embedded into whatever 
bigger structures you have that describes higher-level behaviour. Ie you'd 
put a "struct device" inside the "struct clocksource".
That thingalready *has* the suspend/resume hooks, and it will mean that 
people will see the clocks in the device tree rather than have a new 
notion.
