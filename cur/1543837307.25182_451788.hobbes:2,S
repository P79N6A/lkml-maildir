Maybe that bitmap code should go to kernel/power/bitmaps.c or
something?

All your other functions use bm_XXX, this is XXX_bm. Well, you are
mixing it rather freely..

It seems like this will not really introduce O(n^2) behaviour, since
you are starting from last position each time?
You have my ACK here, but maybe it should go _after_ 4/5 and 5/5?
Those are simple cleanups, this has break-something-potential and
should rest in -mm for a while.
