It might be an idea, however, to increase this bonus to
the number of processors in the system. That way we can
enjoy a little more throughput on an smp system without
the penalty of unresponsiveness.
A few other things have changed since 2.1.x too, maybe
the patch makes sense on up systems too, but I doubt
that the value should be as large as Andrea puts it...
Andrea, have you tested your patch on a loaded UP system
and tested the interactive feel of the system under X?
regards,
Rik
