when comparing radeon_tcl.c with r200_tcl.c I noticed:
in radeon_tcl.c:
#define CLOSE_ELTS()  RADEON_NEWPRIM( rmesa )
in r200_tcl.c:
#define CLOSE_ELTS()                            \
do {                                            \
   if (0) R200_NEWPRIM( rmesa );                \
}                                               \
while (0)
Does the lockup occur when disabling hw-tcl?
best regards,
Andreas
