Subject: [patch 04/85] devices cgroup: allow mkfifo
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Serge E. Hallyn <serue@us.ibm.com>
commit 0b82ac37b889ec881b645860da3775118effb3ca upstream.
The devcgroup_inode_permission() hook in the devices whitelist cgroup has
always bypassed access checks on fifos.  But the mknod hook did not.  The
devices whitelist is only about block and char devices, and fifos can't
even be added to the whitelist, so fifos can't be created at all except by
tasks which have 'a' in their whitelist (meaning they have access to all
devices).
Fix the behavior by bypassing access checks to mkfifo.
