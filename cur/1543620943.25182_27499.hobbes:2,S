With current kernels the maximum block size of a file system you can mount
is the page size of the architecture. Generally people limit to 4K to avoid
file systems that only work with some machines.
Going to a block size bigger than page size causes all sorts of fun with 
allocation failures if there are not two pages free adjacent to one another
when allocating, and isn't really worth the cost.
