This is the sampling vs. counting distinction again, and it sounds
like these counters were designed for counting but not sampling.  If
Ingo and Thomas extend their infrastructure to provide good support
for counting as well as sampling, then you should hopefully be able to
use them for counting, at least.
On POWER6 we have a somewhat similar situation with two out of the six
available counters.  These two counters are fixed function (they
always count cycles and instructions completed) and don't generate
interrupts.  Furthermore, they are only 32 bits wide.  So I definitely
agree we need support for counters that don't interrupt.
