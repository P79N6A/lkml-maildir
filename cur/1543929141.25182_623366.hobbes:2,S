I did measure some anomalies with the AMD K6+ (or something like  
that), in which %gs was faster than %fs.  It was pretty much  
inexplicable, but also unique - all other processors I tested (which  
was a range from Pentium MMX to current) had identical performance.

Some processors do perform slightly better with null selector loads  
than GDT/LDT ones, but it wasn't really noticeable for modern  
processors.  The Intel architecture guy I asked about this said that  
it might be worth doing, but it would likely be swamped by a GDT  
cache miss.  I looked at rearranging the kernel's GDT to pack all the  
kernel entry/exit entries into as few cachelines as possible, but it  
was surprisingly fiddley.

Well, overall it should be fairly easy to make the two arches use  
their own segment registers with a simple #define.  But things like  
ptrace and vm86 were tricky, though I guess the latter isn't an issue  
for 64-bit.
I originally chose %gs for the kernel, partly in the hope that  
compiler support for TLS would be helpful in the kernel, though that  
doesn't seem like a good idea in retrospect.  %gs for the sake of  
consistency would be reasonable, and wouldn't have a measurable  
downside.
