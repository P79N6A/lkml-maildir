The mail subject most likely is wrong, since the IRQ message above
doesn't suggest a BIOS issue at all,
since the message is most likely a result of calling snd_cs4281_free()
in failure path, which disables this IRQ again.

I believe that it's a simple hardware mismatch failure in the main probe
function of this driver, nothing else.

The best way to find out is to edit snd_cs4281_probe() and add snd_printk()s
at all error paths to find the one which actually fails.
