I was concerned about a race of cpu_quiet for the dead cpu (last cpu in 
a group) with a concurrent cpu_quiet for another cpu in another cpu 
group. A stale bit in either rcu_state.outstanding or 
rcu_groups[].outstanding would lock up the rcu subsystem. I've thought 
about it again and I agree with you - there is no race.
I agree with most of your other points - the patch is a proof of 
concept, it definitively needs a big cleanup before is should be 
considered for merging [+ a system that needs it]
