The affinity of the process is reset to the default and it is migrated
to another cpu, for better or worse.  The kernel assumes the admin
know what he/she is doing.

Yeah.  But I don't think this is an issue to be solved in the kernel.
Applications that are this sensitive to cpu hotplugging need to
arrange to be notified before the hotplug occurs, which I think would
be best done with dbus or some other IPC.
