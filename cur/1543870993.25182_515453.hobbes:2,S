XP-2800 Athlon on a biostar board whose model number I've forgotten. 1 GB 
of dual channel 400 mhz ram running at 333 because this athlon falls over 
at 400mhz fsb settings.  480GB of drives in 3 pieces.
Running a jaton 3dForce 6200-256 video card with nvidia driver, which does 
the opengl stuff better than the ati 9200se I took out a week ago, but 
this nvidia card is several times harder on the cpu when tvtime is 
running than the ati was.  There are other cards in this box, 1394, nic, 
usb expander, but that is the main list of power burners.
Its dmesg clock is just short of 2100. and:
Calibrating delay using timer specific routine.. 4177.82 BogoMIPS 
(lpj=2088910)
In comparison to an XP-1400 I had before, this is nowhere near 2x faster.
