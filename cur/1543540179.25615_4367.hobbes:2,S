/proc/mounts is a bad location, I think; for one thing, the number of
actual mount at least used to be :) fairly limited.  Also, /proc/mounts
is impossible to parse cleanly -- if you have mount points with spaces
or 
\n or some such you can really wreck havoc (we need a standard escaping
algorithm for /proc, or insert null terminators.)
