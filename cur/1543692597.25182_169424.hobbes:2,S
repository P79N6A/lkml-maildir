I added the list because this is another problem that need fixiong inside the 
kernel.

Cdrecord and pther programs too includes <sys/param.h>
If you change HZ in the kernel include files and recompile your problems
suffer from the same sort of inconsistencies that have been the reason for
my initial mail.
If Linux likes to support changes to HZ, then it needs to support POSIX
interfaces. On Solaris, sys/param.h looks this way:
#define        HZ              ((clock_t)_sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK))
You may even change HZ on a running Solaris system.... the only programs that
are affected may be the ones that have timeouts while the change has been done.
The problem is that the timeouts in the SCSI interface are based on HZ rather
than being abstract from kernel internals.
