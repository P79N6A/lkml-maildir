Fortunately it is not a problem for foo.S code - yet.  External symbol
references only need module version pre-processing when the code is in
a module.  AFAIK no *.S code is compiled into a module, all *.S code is
built into vmlinux, this is why I did not use this argument myself.
OTOH if any *.S code is compiled into a module then all symbols it
refers to must be EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS().
