Is support for HSM (Hierarchical-Storage-Management) in the Linux Kernel
planned?
Like support for transparent file-pointers, that could start a
HSM-file-retrieval-program to get a file from whereever and insert it, where
the transparent file-pointer was.
and the whole feature set.
How could this functionality be achieved???
