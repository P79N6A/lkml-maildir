AFAIU Daniel's patch still leaves the possibility to use the '-' syntax,
doesn't it?
(The program 'cat' is of the kind which always reads from stdin if no
file name is given, or if '-' is given instead of a file name.  So,
'cat' allows Andy to start it and then type something in for cat to
process in either case, while checkpatch supports this only with '-' as
argument.  OTOH it's easier to get checkpatch to print a usage note than
it is with cat.  There you have to type no less than 'cat --help', or at
least with GNU cat.)
