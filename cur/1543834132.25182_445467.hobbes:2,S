Your program seems highly sensitive to any changes, e.g. with the
following code, results with and without the commented lines are
different.  (I changed i to 5555555 because my cpu is slower than
yours and changed main() to call it 10 times.)  This on an AMD
Turion64 1.6GHz running an i386 kernel with stock arch_stack_align()
and randomize_va_space == 1.
void fn()
{
        double x = 0.0, y = 0.0;
        long i = 5555555;
//      static int printed = 0;
//
//      if (!printed) {
//              printed++;
//              printf("&x = %p, &y = %p\n", &x, &y);
//      }
        elapsed(1);
        while (i--)
                fn2(&x,&y);
        printf("%4lu ", elapsed(0));
}
$ ./tst.ex
&x = 0xbfb32d90, &y = 0xbfb32d98
  10    6   10   10    6   10    7   10   10   10   10   10   10   10   10   10   10   10   10   10 msec
$ ./tst.ex
   7   10    6    6    6    6   10   10    6    6    6   10   10    6    6    6    6   10    6    6 msec
BTW when compiled with gcc 4.1.1 using -O3 it just prints all zeros,
so I had to use 3.3.3.
