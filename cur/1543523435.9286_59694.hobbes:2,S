Only if the index is generated algorithmically.

There is a point. If your 16 bit values have only around 8 bits of
entropy, then running them through such an array is a fast and (with
good values in the array) effective method of generating outputs
whose size matches the entropy.
(Methinks you could do as well or better with several smaller arrays,
but that is not germane here.)

A good reference for the practice is RFC 1750.
