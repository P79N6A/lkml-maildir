Subject: Old ipw2200 code in 2.6.13-git3 and 2.6.13-mm1

The most recent IPW2200 release is 1.0.6.  Now we have:
          #define IPW2200_VERSION "1.0.0"
in 2.6.13-git2.  Here, the version of firmware is set to the last release:
          ipw2200.c:#define IPW_FW_MAJOR_VERSION 2
          ipw2200.c:#define IPW_FW_MINOR_VERSION 2
The most recent firmware release is 2.3.
When I attempt to bring up the ipw2200 network connection to a
wireless hub with WPA2 encrypted connection, I get the following
error:
WEXT auth param 7 value 0x1 - ioctl[SIOCSIWAUTH]: Operation not supported
ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Operation not supported
ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Operation not supported
ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Operation not supported
ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Operation not supported
WEXT auth param 4 value 0x0 - ioctl[SIOCSIWAUTH]: Operation not supported
WEXT auth param 5 value 0x1 - ioctl[SIOCSIWAUTH]: Operation not supported
Can we please get the latest IPW2200 code into the development kernels soon?
Many thanks,
       Miles
