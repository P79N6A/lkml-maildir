I have a machine running 2.2.3 with the following IP addresses assigned:
  eth0   204.180.47.99 netmask 255.255.255.224
  eth0:0 209.43.25.195 netmask 255.255.255.0
I would like to be able to "hide" the eth0:0 interface. By that I mean I
don't want it to be used as the source address for any outgoing packets
except when a another machine deliberately initiates a connection to it.
Specifically, I don't want it used as the default source address when sending
to another host in the 209.43.25.* netblock. If possible I don't want it to
be listened to when a socket binds to INADDR_ANY, but this isn't as important
as the first part.
I hope to find a kernel flag, perhaps in /proc/net, that would mark the alias
nondefaultable, but I couldn't find one. Did I overlook it?
