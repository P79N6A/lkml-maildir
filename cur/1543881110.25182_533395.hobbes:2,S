Actually, that's not as simple.
For the usb stick or cdrom you need physical access to the machine.
And once you have that you basically have full control over the system
anyway.
But with block filesystems, the user would still need access to the
device (currently kernel doesn't even check this I think).
So it may make sense to mark all block based filesystems safe, and
defer permission checking to user access on the block device.
But the safe flag is still needed for filesystems, which don't have
such an additional access checking, such as network filesystems.
