Yes

Do we really want modules for all kind of exotic hardware only used by one
company in the kernel tree? In this case we are the only user of this module
since we make the HW ourself and doesn't resell it. So it's my headache if
any API or similar is changed.

Sure. Any suggestions welcome.

also... when are you going to get this module merged?
(exporting things without the module going into kernel.org shouldn't be
done imo... it makes it harder to change internals and causes overhead
for all kernel users)
