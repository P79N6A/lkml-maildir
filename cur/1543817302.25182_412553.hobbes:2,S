Hmm. That expression is _really_ hard to figure out.
It would be more logical to make it
	depends on USB_STORAGE && (BLK_DEV_IDE=y || BLK_DEV_IDE=USB_STORAGE)
or, even more preferably, split up the rules as two separate dependencies:
	depends on USB_STORAGE
	depends on BLK_DEV_IDE=y || BLK_DEV_IDE=USB_STORAGE
(where that second thing really _should_ be expressible as
	depends on BLK_DEV_IDE >= USB_STORAGE
but the kconfig language doesn't support that syntax..)
