I found that when doing free to the buffer after the vmsplice and
befaore the splice syscall, the page is really moved without any
memcpy, this means the flow of my application should be:
- malloc aligned buffer
- fill the buffer with the desired data
- vmsplice
- free the buffer
- call splice.
but I still don't get I improvements, and when profing the kernel I
see _clear_user_page() too often, I guess this function called to
clean the new buffers allocated by the user, for securty and privacy
reasons, but the overhead of this operation is expensive.
is there any way to prevent the kernel from cleaning new allocated buffers?
