I don't think many people have run e2fsck on such a large filesystem
before when there are lots of problems.  It is entirely possible that
you need so much memory for such a large filesystem.  I would suggest
creating a larger swap file temporarily (on some other partition) so
that e2fsck can complete.
It _may_ be that e2fsck could reduce memory consumption somewhere (or
enable a "use less memory but run slowly" heuristic, but that isn't
very likely, or if it was it would be very slow.
Regarding the "use fsck.ext3" response - ignore it, it is incorrect.
There is no difference at all between fsck.ext2, fsck.ext3, e2fsck.
Cheers, Andreas
