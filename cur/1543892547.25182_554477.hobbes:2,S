I'll fix the necessary patch for x86_64, in that case.

Exactly. I was only mentioning that the smp_call_function*
of x86{_64} were safe anyway (but the smp_processor_id()
that would've preceded it need not have been, of course).

Indeed -- this was doubly problematic because the un-safeness
was because of smp_processor_id() as well as the (eventual)
access of cpu_online_map (via smp_call_function() ->
num_online_cpus()) ... thanks for letting me know about this.
