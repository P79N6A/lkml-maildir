Subject: [PATCH]  Block layer bug handling partial bvec
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Previously I submitted a patch for "blk: request botched" on floppy
write.  While the patch did make the floppy work, Jens mentioned 
that an underlying error still existed.   This spurred me on to look a 
little deeper and finally i found the root cause.   
There is a bug in "ll_rw_blk.c" handling partial bvec submissions.
For whatever reason the floppy driver was triggering it more than
other users.  Note that with the attached patch, my previous 
floppy_ patch is no longer needed.
Cheers,
Sean
