At least HP-UX and IRIX had this for a long time.
BTW, how about enhancing the patch to allow a similar behaviour as
other unixen, i.e. being able to attach a priority to these SCHED_IDLE
processes?
Under IRIX (for example) SCHED_OTHER processes run at a priority thats about
in the _middle_ of the SCHED_FIFO priority range, i.e. you can have
SCHED_FIFO processes with lower priority than normal tasks.
It's also fully POSIX compliant, btw ;)
