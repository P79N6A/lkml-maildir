Linus, All,
	As promised, here is a minor cleanup that removes the usage of
CONFIG_X86_TSC in get_cycles(), replacing it with a runtime conditional
of if(cpu_has_tsc).
Andi: I've already posted this a few times without complaint, but since
you didn't like my playing with get_cycles() last time, let me know if
have any issues with this.
thanks
