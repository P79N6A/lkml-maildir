The help output from it is pretty much all there is.
You might have better luck asking on linuxppc-dev@ozlabs.org though
(adding as Cc).
There's also an old writeup at
http://mbligh.org/linuxdocs/Kernel/DebuggingPPC64
 for the very basics
of digging through a crash. Some of it is likely out of date by now.
