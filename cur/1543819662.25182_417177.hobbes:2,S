Erich, please stop top posting! I've asked you several times now.

Since you are a hardware vendor, you probably have access to various
hardware analyzers that you can hook up. It seems to be easily
reproducible for you with ext2, why don't you see if you bus traffic
corresponds to what you expect with 4096 xfer size?
Again, I don't think I can help you with this. We have larger
max_sectors drivers out there and experience no problems. I'm fairly
confident that this is a bug in your driver/hardware that you need to
work out.
