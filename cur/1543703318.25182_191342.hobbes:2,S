Hi Jari,
Could you give me more information about this back-door, and generally
speaking how it would be exploited?  I want to be sure that I am affected
by this problem.
Also, in the loop-AES.README, this is mentioned:
"Device backed loop device can be used with journaling file systems as
device backed loops guarantee that writes reach disk platters in
order required by journaling file system (write caching must be disabled
on the disk drive, of course)"
Are you talking about the "hdparm -W" flag for IDE drives?  Would I need
to disable write caching when using non-journaling file systems?
thanks,
Jim Faulkner
