That is certainly a Fedora bug if they update a kernel package that
requires userland configs to be updated and then don't update those
configs.  This seems to be a common pattern with Fedora, the kernel
packages change way faster than the userland tools and they are fast and
loose about not updating userland.  To be perfectly honest I switched to
Debian partially for this reason.
Do they really claim this is not a bug?
