Personally I'm still missing two things:
1) A command to let me see what this Linus guy have applied compared to
my tree - without touching anything in my tree. bk changes -R
2) A dry-run of a fetch+pull. I can do that if I really study the man
pages I know. But "git pull --dry-run" would be more convinient.
Other than that I will say that I'm pleased with the funtionality that
I use - that's maybe 10% of the possibilities...
