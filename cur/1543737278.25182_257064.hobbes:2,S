Subject: [2.6.8.1/x86] Kernel doesn't see the serial port of an ISA modem

The ISAPNP scans PnP cards and finds the ISA modem.  And then 8250
reports about the only two serial ports found, which live in the
motherboard.  And there is no the modem's ttyS2, no its IRQ.  Under
2.4.x kernels all the things work fine.  So, where am I wrong?
