   Hey, this is not a patch, and I was using Thunderbird's msg editor -- 
which isn;t really good to tabs. :-)

   We could use memzero() but memset() should boil down to it anyway.

   Not really, we don't need to waste time initiazlizing it on reads -- 
I hope you understand that it will require real code to write all those 
zeros?). Besides, only {0} should be enough as other entries should be 
implitly zeroed).

   These bytes can be anything actually as a device should just ignore them.

   I do. :-)

   It should do the Right Thing WRT the byte reordering (which is a lack 
thereof ;-) while your code had to muck with it explicitly. And of 
course it's shorter -- because of that.

  I thought we should care about general user satisfaction, not just 
Alan's... :-)

   I'm not actually very enthusiastic in getting blamed for the 
breakage, given the Alan's example. ;-)
