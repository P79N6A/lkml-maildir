I didn't mean to say that the condition was not critical, i meant that the 
interrupt generated is used for notification purposes, and in its current 
state the interrupt handler only provides information rather than taking 
measures due to the condition. The condition in this case is handled 
automatically by the hardware and we just receive notification via an 
interrupt getting triggered. However i have taken your suggestion and 
moved the vector.
