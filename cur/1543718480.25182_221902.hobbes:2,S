    It is, really, because it you look at the headers of messages
coming from the LKML, they have a X-Mailing-List header you can use
for filtering, so there is no need to add a string in the subject. If
you look at common subjects in this list, you can see some of them
are pretty large, so prepending '[LKML]:' will be bloat.
    You can use procmail to do that filtering based upon the
X-Mailing-List header, but you can also use your Mail User Agent to
do more or less the same. I see you use KMail, and I don't know if
you can use it to filter messages, but you can do with mutt or elmo
(AFAIK) without procmail.
    IMHO, adding a string to the subject (I assume that you were
talking about adding the string to the subject and not to the message
body) is not needed and will impose visual clutter. If you cannot (or
don't want to) use procmail, try to do the filtering with your MUA if
it is powerful enough.
