Ah, you probably got me wrong. The patch doesn't work, because of the
sysfs_remove_group() stuff. That's why there is no Signed-off-by:...
What _could_ happen with this patch applied: some code fails on
CPU_UP_PREPARE and then all notifiers get called with CPU_UP_CANCELLED.
That would cause the call of topology_remove_dev(sys_dev) and therefore
sysfs_remove_group(&sys_dev->kobj, &topology_attr_group) which will crash,
because sysfs_create_group() wasn't even called.
To fix this one has to remember if sysfs_create_group() succeeded or was
even called. That would be a per-cpu array. Now, I think it's just
overkill to introduce a per-cpu array for error-checking.
IMHO it would make sense to change sysfs_remove_group() so it will survive
if being asked to remove groups that don't exist.
