Its not just this, look at all the CONFIG_IPV6 related #ifdefs in the core
tcp/ip v4 code, the point is that this is a (currently) needed limitation to be
able to ship a kernel that can be used by both ipv6 users and people that
doesn't (yet) need ipv6.
Simply removing the ifdefs in the headers will not help, leaving it in the
kernel will bloat general purpose kernels, so can we live with this limitation
till we sort out the IPV6/IPV4 entanglement in a good way? I.e. lets leave ipv6
as a special case, perhaps just adding a big fat warning in relevant Kconfigs.
