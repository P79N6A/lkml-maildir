It really shouldn't matter - at that point we have the page locked, and
we know the page has buffers, so the page cannot go away from under us:
we can delay the "increment page count" simply because we know somebody
else (the buffers) hold on to the page.
Which is not to say that I disagree with the patch itself: it tends to
be good practice to not depend on quite-so-subtle locking rules. It just
really shouldn't make any difference to the problem.
