Hello All,
I did not get any answer from Matt and was sure that it was of no interest.
This was my mistake, sorry for not sending it earlier to more people.
I will be very happy to discuss any aspect of the paper and we do suggest
ways we think can improve the /dev/random security (a very simple issue for
example is implementing quotas on the consumption of random numbers)
Thanks,
Zvi

Who said anything about demanding? he wanted to discuss the paper. He
received no response (AFAIK). Please don't read more into it.

For security related information, it is sometimes best not to tell the
whole world about it immediately (although you should definitely tell
the whole world about it eventually). It should've probably been
posted to lkml when mpm didn't respond, I agree. I'll take the blame
for not suggesting that to Zvi.
Cheers,
Muli
