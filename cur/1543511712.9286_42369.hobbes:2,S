Hello,
a new version of PPSkit is available. I'll simply recomment everyone
using a 0.7 version to upgrade, and I'll add the NEWS and the LSM file
below.
Enjoy,
Ulrich
+ Implemented ``PPS_ECHOASSERT'' and ``PPS_ECHOCLEAR'' via UART's RTS
  bit (documented in README).  Fixed bug for ``CLEAR'' events
  (actually ``ASSERT'' events had been captured before).
+ Added and updated future plans in ``TODO''.
+ Updated ``enable_pps.c'' for draft conformance.  Added option to set
  PPS offset (``-oXY'').  Added option to enable event echo (``-EX'').
+ PPS API consolidation (draft "03" dated 1999-02-11): Added some
  comments to ``timepps.h''.  Tightened permission checking in serial
  driver for maximum conformance to the specification.
+ Added dynamic jitter threshold (``PPS_POPCORN'') and an extra error
  condition for bad pulses in ``hardpps()'' (Taken from
  nanokernel-19990829).
+ Added little optimizations in ``kernel/time.c'' that may reduce
  extra jitter under heavy load.  Warning message about
  ``update_wall_time: ticks is >1'' suppressed unless debugging (I had
  seen values up to 5).
+ Updated patch for ntp-4.0.97.  Updated NTP sample configuration
  file.  Updated README with some details about the PPS activation.
+ Merged patch for Linux-2.2.12: Some extra blanks removed in
  ``arch/ppc/kernel/time.c'' (untested).  ``kernel/time.c'' needs
  ``linux/config.h'' now (well, it always did).  Heavily tested the
  code for i386 architecture (386SX and Pentium).  Corrected spelling
  in ``kernel-time.txt''.
