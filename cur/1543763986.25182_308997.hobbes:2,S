That's what I had originally, actually called firmware_ihex.ko, since
the IHEX format parser is not in any way keyspan specific and there are
several usb-serial converters that seem to use the same IHEX->.h trick
which could trivially be modified to use this loader.
But the compiled parser fairly small (< 2KB) and adding it to the
existing module didn't effectively add any size to the firmware_class
module since things are rounded to a page boundary anyways.
