It handles the bus/chipset layer above what the MCE code monitors. Its the
other half of the code. And yes both are important. Its difficult to claim
a highly available and reliable system when it doesnt detect and log errors
for analysis.
I've fixed a couple of bugs, when 2.2.18pre4 is out can you try it and get
another trap out of it. It should this time log it nicely and panic cleanly
not oops.
