It doesn't appear to be this simple in reality. Chris has reports that 
indeed enabling ACPI avoids the needs for quirks, but Gentoo have 
reports that quirks are *only* required in ACPI mode. Sergio is of the 
opinion that quirks are not required in IO-APIC setups, but Stian has 
shown that quirks are required on legacy interrupts even with a working 
IO-APIC setup.
Len Brown has some notes to add:
