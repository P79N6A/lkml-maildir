I added this to deal with the case where you're sending an IPI to 
another VCPU which isn't currently running on a real cpu.  In this case 
you could end up spinning while the other VCPU is waiting for a real CPU 
to run on.  (Basically the same problem that spinlocks have in a virtual 
environment.)
However, this is at best a partial solution to the problem, and I never 
benchmarked if it really makes a difference.  Since any other virtual 
environment would have the same problem, its best if we can solve it 
generically.  (Of course a synchronous single-target cross-cpu call is a 
simple cross-cpu rpc, which could be implemented very efficiently in the 
host/hypervisor by simply doing a vcpu context switch...)
