See above.
Basically, the algorithm is:
	invalidate_cpu_mask = 0;
	.. for each page swapped out ..
		pte = ptep_get_and_clear(ptep);
		save_pte_and_mm(pte_page(pte));
		mask = mm->cpu_vm_mask;
		if (page_count(pmd_page) > 1)
			mask = ~0UL;
		invalidate_cpu_mask |= mask;
and then at the end you just do
	flush_tlb_cpus(invalidate_cpu_mask);
	for_each_page_saved() {
		free_page(page);
	}
(yeah, yeah, add cache coherency etc).
