It should be ok - if kfree() has problems with a NULL pointer that is a
bug in kfree. Basically, I'd like the kernel kmalloc/kfree to look as much
as possible as the user ones (apart, obviously, from the kernel-forced
stuff like the memory allocation attribute). And malloc/free allow NULL
pointers - it would be a nasty surprise to people who are used to that if
the kmalloc/kfree thing behaved differently.
