Hello David,
I haven't been able to try your patch yet. However, two nice people from
the zenega-user forum ("hemonu" and "scythe") tried the patch. It fixed
the garbled screen problem for them.
If that's not good enough for you or if you need additional information,
I can try it myself.
Thanks for your prompt reply!
Michael
