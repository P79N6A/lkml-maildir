I've got the same box, and I've given up on the firewire side of
things and I just use the USB port now.  But it's just my backup box,
so I don't really use it too much.

Check anyway... I think I posted recently about my luck in getting the
USB side working with 2.6.12+ once I updated the firmware on the
chipset, which was a pain.

Yeah, from what I've been reading, the Prolific chipset sucked even
for Windows users, at least until the latest firmware.  Goto these
pages:

The second one is a forum which had some useful info.

You need to go by chipset, not by enclosure.  I poked on my system,
but there's nothing obvious about how to get the firmware level in the
output of 'lsusb'.  Sorry.

It works with USB, I don't know about firewire since I've just chucked
that for now.  Which is why I got the dual input setup, USB/Firewire.
Haven't tried the firewire on a Windows box either since the upgrade,
might one of these days, but I'm in no rush.
