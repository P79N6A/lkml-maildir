Hi,
  Can anyone tell me if there is anyway one can control the replacement of
a cache-line from kernel space. To give an example, lets say I have a
memory adress and a size_t and I want to make sure that amount of data is
not flushed from L1 after it is brought in for a given period of time. Is
there any way we can do this for i386 ?
Thanks,
Koushik
