  Correct, after sending in patches to people who didn't bother to ack
them (except Alan), I got the message and stopped bothering people.  Since
I've been writing software for a living longer than there's been a Linux,
I always provide a description of the bug with a test if needed. 
Somewhere around 2.1 I let it ride, and I haven't even followed lkml until
about six months ago.

  People who would like to see better performance in *this* stable kernel,
not 2.6 in two years (look at the jump from stable 2.2 to whatever you
think is stable in 2.4 and tell me your estimate).
  I won't bring it up again, I'd love to think Rik, Alan and Ingo will
keep working on performance patches for 2.4, but I wouldn't bet on it.

  I have no idea if this is related to the fix posted recently WRT PL/IP,
after I commented that I was looking at the code to see why it changed
someone asked if 19-pre2 didn't work. I admit I only looked to see if the
change which broke it was reverted, but it looks as if some work has been
done in -pre2, might be worth a try. I'm going to build pre2-ac2 and mjc
for some laptop benchmarks, I'll turn on ZIP support and try my old unit
(the original protocol). I'll try to report back on that in the next day
or so.
  If I brought my laplink cable with me I might give PL/IP a try this
week, otherwise I'll bring it next week, the weekend is being better spent
on ECAC hockey playoffs ;-)
