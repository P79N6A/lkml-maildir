Ok so I can compile with a.out support. End of problem, that makes the
patch useful and "spec compliant", although the spec compliance is
irrelevant anyway. The spec doesn't determine what Linux is it's a
useful reference for normality. Special cases are special cases and you
harm the system by seeking to stop stuff that works purely for pieces of
paper.
