IMHO this is a "when we need it" patch.  Baby steps...

Probably want a get_cpu_ptr() & put_cpu_ptr() using get_cpu() and put_cpu()
(and this would become __get_cpu_ptr()).
And probably move them all to linux/percpu.h.

Hmm... It'd be nice to remove these three from the header so that the
interface is clear (which may mean exposing some slab.c internals so
you can access them in mm/percpu_data.c).

A space between the "if" and the "(" is traditional.
Cheers,
