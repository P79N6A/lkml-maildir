As I understand the BogoMIPS value is used for some fine grained
delays. How does then the system survive a big change in the processor
speed when :
 - user changes FSB on the fly ( possible with newer mainboards,
   I never tried it though )
 - CPU goes to lower clock due to power management
 - user (de)activates TURBO on older x86 computers
?
