Forgive me if I am being dense, but I still don't see how that works.  
The current code:
   return (strncmp(pdev->name, drv->name, BUS_ID_SIZE) == 0);
will only return 1 if pdev->name and drv->name are _identical_ for the 
first 20 bytes.  Which "floppy" and "floppy0" are not.
Could it be that all current platform devices are initially named
as "<name>" and the instance number is only appended after matching
has been done?
Later,
Kenn
