Hmm, it was my understanding that all PC BIOSes DO zero out memory,
although this is not necessarily a requirement of the hardware.  The
reason I say this is because one of the features of the Linux BIOS
project is to allow crashdump analysis after a reboot, by pulling
the dump from the RAM after a reboot.  You apparently are not able
to do this with normal PC BIOSes because they clear the RAM after
a reset.
That said, I'm not sure what the requirements of different kinds of
RAM chips are for initialization, so there may not be a REQUIREMENT
to clear the memory, but rather it is part of the nebulous "PC spec".
Cheers, Andreas
