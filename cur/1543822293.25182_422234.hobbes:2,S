Well, I am making it NUMA aware as the first identified user of such
a routine does want to make node specific allocations.  I haven't thought
about the 'large' allocations.
Any thoughts about also including free_memory_early() routines?  It
seems like a good idea.  However,  I'm somewhat afraid of these gaining
widespread use and the potential mis-use.  Using free in the same routine
as the alloc (such as in error paths) is generally ok.  But, trying to
do a free at a later time requires the attention of the coder.  Just don't
want people to think these wrappers will be a substitute for that analysis.
