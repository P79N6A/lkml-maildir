Marcelo, This particular vulnerability is not present in 2.6 base. As I
mentioned in that bugzilla, 2.6 base increased IO_BITMAP_BITS  to 65536
and the kernel initializes this bitmap pointer during boot appropriately.
But in general the specified limit is wrong and needs to be fixed.
Appended patch will fix the tss limit. Andrew, please apply. Thanks.
