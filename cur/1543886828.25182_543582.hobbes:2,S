I agree that we should keep the "platform" default,
as it went in 2 releases ago (nearly 6 months) without
any reported failures until this one -- and it fixed
a longstanding issue documented on many machines.
We should debug Qi's failure like any other.
We are actually in better shape on this one than others
because we already know something that works around it.
Qi,
Please open a bug report here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
in the Power-Off category.  There are some other open
poweroff bugs and maybe we'll find a common thread.
Please attach the output from acpidump and
dmesg -s64000.
thanks,
-Len
