    The help option for the loopback device lists util-linux as
    being on 
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux/util/
 but it is
    in 
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/
Right.
	(latest: util-linux-2.9i.tar.gz)
It is also in 
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/utils/util-linux/
	(latest: util-linux-2.9l.tar.gz)
[At first there was a break-in and the server was moved to a different
machine. Then ftp.win.tue.nl became one the ftp.nl.kernel.org machines
and that defined a content for /pub/linux. So the things that used to
be only at ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux (like the kernel archive) are now
at ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local.]
