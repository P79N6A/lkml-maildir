I'm afraid that this patch set doesn't do cpusets very well.
It builds and boots and mounts the cpuset file system ok.
But trying to write the 'mems' file hangs the system hard.
I had to test it against 2.6.21-rc7-mm2, because I can't boot
2.6.21-rc7-mm1, due to the 'bad_page' problem that I noted in an
earlier post this evening on lkml.
These container patches seemed to apply ok against 2.6.21-rc7-mm2,
and built and booted ok.  I built with an sn2_defconfig configuration,
having the following CONTAINER and CPUSET settings:
    CONFIG_CONTAINERS=y
    CONFIG_CONTAINER_DEBUG=y
    CONFIG_CPUSETS=y
    CONFIG_CONTAINER_CPUACCT=y
    CONFIG_PROC_PID_CPUSET=y
    # CONFIG_ACPI_CONTAINER is not set
I could mount the cpuset file system on /dev/cpuset just fine.
Then I invoked the following commands:
    # cd /dev/cpuset
    # mkdir foo
    # cd foo
    # echo 0-3 > cpus
    # echo 0-1 > mems
At that point, the system hangs.  Reproduced three times, on two boots.
I never get a shell prompt back from that second echo.  I have to hit
Reset.  The three different hangs were done with the following three
different values:
	echo 0-3 > mems
	echo 0-1 > mems
	echo 1 > mems
On that last one, "echo 1 > mems", I did not do the echo to cpus first.
The test system had 8 cpus, numbered 0-7, and 4 mems, numbered 0-3.
