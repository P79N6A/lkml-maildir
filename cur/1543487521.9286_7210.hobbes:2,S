Ackkk!
Full duplex mode never has collisions.
You were likely trying to use full duplex mode on a CSMA/CD Ethernet.
Full duplex can only be used on host-to-host and host-to-switch links, and
only when both endpoints are configured or negotiate full duplex.
Full duplex can never be used when there is a repeater (aka hub) in the
network.  Spank yourself if you configured FDX in that case.
