No problem, I can add the code to free the pool element if
the curr_count ever goes greater than (min_count + 2 * grow_count)
then bring the curr_count to min_count + grow_count by freeing 
some pool objects.
A patch which will apply to this current patch will follow soon.
Thanks Jeff for making your case stronger :)
