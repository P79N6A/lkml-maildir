BINGO!
Do I get to keep the $100000 prize now? :-P
One day you wake up and think by yourself "surely hardware manufacturers
have screwed us enough by now, it cannot happen again" - only for it to *do*
happen again some moments later only...

Does that mean that detection for this card is now fully automatic and
correct? I'm asking since this is what we should really try to achieve:
99% of people are John Does, and 97% of those would assume Linux support
for this card to be "nonexistent"/"broken" ("thiz Leenux SUCKERZ!"),
and a measly remaining 3% would know how to configure this stuff manually
properly.

(that's the guy that has yet another mis-detected "close but entirely
different" TV card sitting and waiting for its bttv fix soon)
