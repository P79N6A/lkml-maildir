Mid 1993. Yeah, it was a while ago. It's the only one I haven't kept
current with.

Do they still have that stupid busy-waiting stuff? The machines loaded
even when you don't actually compute.

When you're doing visualisation you really want to have the entire
dataset in VM at one time. For several applications access is
esentially random.

The issue is keeping it all in VM at once. mmap() does this
beautifully without the need for lots of swap space. I've gone down
the storage manager path, but that's really awkward and slows things
down for everything. You end up implementing the MMU in software. And
even worse, you're copying data around all the time.

I have my own too, but despite it's obvious superiority, people prefer
to use FITS ;-)

If there was a MAP_BE flag for mmap(), then I wouldn't care. Or a
MAP_USER flag (where I'd read in the data myself and byte swap, but on
swap the page is discarded).
