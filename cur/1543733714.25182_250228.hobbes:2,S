do you mean the irq and softirq threading patches? Unfortunately, while
they were rather clean the generic bits were also quite substantially
broken semantically on SMP so while i carried them for a while in the
voluntary-preempt patch i had to drop and redo them all from scratch.
Scott Wood then sent ppc bits which might be based on the other code. 
Anyway, it seems everyone wants roughly the same thing, it only has to
actually happen now ;-) Once we have kernel/hardirq.c then the
irq-threading patches become nicely local and maintainable.
