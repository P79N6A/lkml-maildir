I'm trying to run a linus bk tree on my FC3 system, but I get a lot of
Selinux warnings with minilogd,
Are there some selinux patches that haven't made their way into Linus's
tree but are in the FC kernel?
I don't mind running without Selinux but I like to keep my .config as
close to the FC one as possible..
Dave.
