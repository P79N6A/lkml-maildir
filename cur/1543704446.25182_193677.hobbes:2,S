I'll try to keep it at "One at a Time".
I muddy the waters enough as it is.

email from "Wed Jan 21" says:
"FTQ stands for Flow Through Queue and they are used to connect different
state machines. It turns out that it should also be unnecessary to reset
the FTQs as they get reset during GRC reset. While the FTQ reset itself
is harmless, we recently discovered that it created a race condition
with ASF firmware...."
I don't know more than that. "should also" probably isn't as
conclusive as you would like and it's now third hand.
But you probably know who to ask at Broadcom...
