well, we automatically fall back to lower level zones, check out
__get_pages():
        do {
                page = rmqueue(zone, order);
                if (page)
                        return page;
        } while (zone-- != zones) ;
So we are falling back from ZONE_HIGHMEM to ZONE_NORMAL to ZONE_DMA.

it should be rather fast. But if higher-order zones are completely
allocated then we are under heavy memory pressure anyway. But it should
work already.
