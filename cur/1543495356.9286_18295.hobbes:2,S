That should not happen. I was quite specifically told when I asked about
this a few years back that bzImage should be able to handle kernels up to
16MB in size. >scratches his head<

Weird. My uncompressed kernel image after compiling the sources is > 1MB
in size and when I use bzImage, it is compressed down to 620k.

In theory you should be able to - that's what the bootsect.s stuff is
compiled into the start of the kernel image is for. I believe you could
use dd if=vmlinux of=/dev/fd0, and try booting.
Is the bzImage compression working properly? 
Cheers,
