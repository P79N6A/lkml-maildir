Look at drivers/char/pc_keyb.c
That's where the 2.4.x initialization takes place it seems.
It's pretty generic, but it looks like some of the commands are similar 
in initialize_kbd() - constants are in include/linux/pc_keyb.h
Pretty much all PC hardware has a i8042-like controller, so I think that 
file is the generic PC keyboard startup for i8042-like devices.
Looks like 2.6.x abstracted this a little farther through the serio 
layer, so at initialization, the system tries to assign a particular 
driver to the serio ports it finds (there are drivers for AT, i8042 (and 
variants), etc..)
