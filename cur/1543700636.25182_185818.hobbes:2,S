| This is gcc 2.2.2 for Linux. It is on banjo.concert.net under
| /pub/Linux/GCC. Gcc 2.3 will support Linux, according to RMS. The FSF
| has all the files Linux needs.
Note that this is back when gcc and libc were distributed together, both
by H J Lu.  The file list in the announcement includes:
| 1. 2.2.2db.tar.Z (cpp, libg.a and libc_p.a)
| 2. 2.2.2lib.tar.Z (cc1, cc1plus)
| 3. 2.2.2misc.tar.Z (header files, drivers, libs, doc, ....)
| 4. shlib-2.2.2.tar.Z (making the shared libs for gcc 2.2.2)
| 5. libc-2.2.2.tar.Z (source code for the libs)
| 6. gcc-2.2.2.tar.Z (patches for compiling gcc 2.2.2)
| 7. 0.96bp2inc.tar.Z (the kernel header files for 0.96b patch level 2)
The last file seems to be a modified version of the 0.96bp2 header files
needed in order to work with the new gcc release (searching for that filename
turns up a message discussing it a little)  So I'm guessing that the
July 25, 1992 errno.h in the linux tree is a merge from this code.
Now, does anyone have a copy of "0.96bp2inc.tar.Z" lying around?
