It is not immediately clear what might be causing this, 2.6.23-rc3 didn't 
get any USB nor HID updates at all compared to 2.6.23-rc2.
Could you please enable USB and HID debugging to see whether we can see 
anything spurious in the logs at the time the keyboard gets stuck?
Bisecting this might be a bit painful if it is not reproducible in 
predictable timeframes :(
