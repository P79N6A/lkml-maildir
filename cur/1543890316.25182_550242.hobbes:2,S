Really it would need to extend all action-match items with new  
"named_" equivalents, and most callbacks would need to be extended to  
pass in an object name, if available.  On the other hand, with such  
support implemented then the AppArmor policy compilation tools could  
be transformed into a simple SELinux policy generator.  I estimate  
that the number of new lines of kernel code for such a modified  
SELinux would be 100x less than the kernel code in AppArmor.
