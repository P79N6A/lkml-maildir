I can confirm this as well.
DEVICE:
Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 01)
SYMPTOMS:
      1. No sound.
      2. kernel: azx_get_response timeout 
          messages in system log
      3. Doing modprobe -r snd_hda_intel and then modprobe snd_hda_intel
          produces "general protection fault: 0000 [1] SMP" message.
I think I have seen another thread on this.
