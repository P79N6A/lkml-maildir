Yes,
  Acked-by: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>
It is at best a half-hearted attempt at implementing memory mapping of
the device.
Will pass it on upstream?
While your at it, I'm sure I've sent this patch to Andrew twice, and
it seems to have been silently ignored... Maybe you will have better
luck (if it looks OK to you)??
Thanks,

---------------------------------
Fix match of pci_ids in umem driver.
the pci device list for umem was not using PCI_DEVICE, so the
subvendor/subdevice fields were not set to ANY, so matching
didn't work properly.
Change to use PCI_DEVICE.
