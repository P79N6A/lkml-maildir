Okay.  No doubt Rafael will correct me if I get something wrong.
Greg's tree still contains the original, wrong version of 
pm-make-wakeup-flags-available-whenever-config_pm-is-set.patch.  It 
should be reverted.  In its place should be substituted this series of 
patches (URLs for 0/3 ... 3/3):
	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120561808422302&w=2
	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120561808522316&w=2

There is likely to be a conflict in applying the 2/3 patch, because its 
first hunk touches a region of code also affected by work Rafael has 
been doing.  The important aspect of that hunk is that it moves the 
should_wakeup flag definition outside the region protected by "#ifdef 
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP".
