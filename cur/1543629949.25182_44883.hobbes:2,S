Well, it isn't bad, but what's the point in multiple
set_xxxxxx(char *dst, char *src) functions?
Maybe it makes more sense to have a generic macro
which copies string into char[N] buffer, avoiding overflow.
Actually, there is similar code in your mail:

A macro:
#define STRNCPY(dst,src) \
	do { \
		/* todo: put clever check that dst is char[] here */ \
		strncpy((dst), (src), sizeof(dst)-1); \
		dst[sizeof(dst)-1] = '\0'; \
	} while(0)
