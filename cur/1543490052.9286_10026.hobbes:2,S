Who knows why Windows does this :( I don't see any sense in it.

Well, as I wrote in my original message, if I use BIOS access for the PCI
card, it can be seen, that the I/O information is destroyed too.
There was one way, I could keep the IRQ information. I needed to disable
'interrupt steering' in Windows. However, it didn't restore the I/O
information and there were certain problems in Windows itself (although I
can't remember exactly - it's related to the PnP support of Windows, but
not only), so I decided to stick with the default behaviour.
I hoped, that there might be a way to trigger the BIOS to rewrite the
information about I/O and IRQ.

This would be great.

Yes, but actually I tried to circumvent rebooting, because it's faster.

Unfortunately this is not possible.
