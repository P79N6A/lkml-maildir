You limit your system here - it is possible that userspace should send
some command when kernel agent requires some negotiation.
And even for them it is possible to require ARP request and/or ICMP
processing.

As I stated above it is not enough.
And even if you will cover all kernel-only network allocations, which are
used for your selected datapath, problem still there - admin is unable
to connect although it can be critical connection too.

Feel free to implement any receiving policy inside _separated_ allocator
to meet your needs, but if allocator depends on main system's memory
conditions it is always possible that it will fail to make forward
progress.

You do not know in advance which sockets must be separated (since only
in the simplest situation it is the same as in NBD and is
kernelspace-only),
you can not solve problem with ARP/ICMP/route changes and other control
messages, netfilter, IPsec and compression which still can happen in your 
setup, 
if something goes wrong and receiving will require additional
allocation from network datapath, system is dead,
this strict conditions does not allow flexible control over possible
connections and does not allow to create additional connections.
As far as I understood, it is ok to solve the problem in the exact your
case without all or most of the above issues in the setup, but in
general some other mechanism should be used, which will not suffer or
will allow to control above issues.

Just for clarification: network tree allocator gets 512kb and then
increases cache size when it is required. Default value can be changed
of course.
