Please look at my pseudo-code carefully.  It uses dnotify to
test-and-set the bit; there isn't a "notify" event.
In other words, I'm making dnotify simpler by getting rid of the
signal, so it becomes exactly the same as Ingo's syscall:
        while (sys_mark_dir_clean(dirfd) == 0) {
            do_readdir(dirfd);
        }
        /* use results */
becomes:
        while (fcntl(dirfd, F_NOTIFY,
               DN_CREATE|DN_RENAME|DN_DELETE|DN_NOSIGNAL) != 0) {
            do_readdir(dirfd);
        }
        /* use results */
In my scheme, we still have O_CLEAN.  (Have I said that's a great idea
enough times yet?)
The reason I prefer to add DN_NOSIGNAL to dnotify instead of a new
syscall should be obvious: it's a simple change, equally fast, and
dnotify is a _lot_ more versatile.
For Samba, dnotify lets you be more selective for various cache types,
and poll() can do multiple tests in a single syscall - good for path
walk algorithms (although I've shown in another email how the tests
can be elided completely).
The combination of O_CLEAN with dnotify is useful for many other
applications.  I don't want to complicate this explanation by
describing them.  The dnotify change by itself is also good.
In short, it's a good thing, with no bad sides.
