This is, AFAICT, overkill (the UP compilation fix appreciated though).
When a new CPU comes up, there is a semaphore which is held through
the notifier, so you can't have two CPUs come up at once.
Therefore, the new migration thread is either started on a completely
active cpu (ie. there's a migration thread on that CPU to use), or
it's already on the new cpu, in which case set_cpus_allowed is a noop.
What am I missing?
Rusty.
