Yes. This error is already fixed in 2.4.3-ac4, as I already wrote. Use newer
kernel or compile IPX as module. I believe that it is fixed in 2.4.4-pre2 
too. Patch I sent fixed compilation with disabled CONFIG_SYSCTL. As
I use zerocopy patches from Alan tree, I cannot create tested patch
for Linus tree (and I try to avoid creation of untested patches)...
