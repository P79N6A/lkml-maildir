gcc -version is fine. A compile will cause the problem.
It should be noted that whilst a ./configure cycle is *guaranteed* to initiate 
the MCE, the MCE can occur on other (seemingly random) occasions.
This of course smacks of hardware failure, but not only are the components new 
I have also swapped them all (excluding graphics card.) And, don't forget, 
simple dual 'SMP' mode works fine too.
