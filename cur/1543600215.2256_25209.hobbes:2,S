I am seeing zombies as well. This coincided with me installing SuSE 7.2 on 
my Athlon so I thought it to be user space...
I have only really noticed this with cron processes. A random example, ps 
ax says:
9862 ? Z 0:00 [cron <defunct>]
Looking at ppid we find the parent process /usr/sbin/cron which is in S state.
Seems to be harmless though, as the zombies just disappear after a little 
while so I never bothered reporting to anyone.
Just my 2p.
