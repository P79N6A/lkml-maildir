Okay, I just went back and looked at it... this particular checkin had
*zero* code impact (code not yet turned on), as did any of the checkins
immediately surrounding it.
Since your other email points to
f216cc3748a3a22c2b99390fddcdafa0583791a2, which is a *much* later
checkin, and which seems to actually have something to do with power
states, that the above is a red herring?
