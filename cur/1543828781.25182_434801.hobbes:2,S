are you referring to the replacement patch for 20/20 ?
The one that said RFC ??
heh - youre right, tho  :-}  I retract that patch.
Forgive the over-wound (and in retrospect, kinda stunned) newbie !
I'll spend some time making the Doc more coherent, and into an actual patch.
I guess I was hoping for some comments before doing this..
Whats a good name for this file?  (for purposes of focusing the tone and 
content)
     Doc/sysfs/gpio-interface ?  Doc/hwmon/gpio-sysfs-interface ?
thanks !
