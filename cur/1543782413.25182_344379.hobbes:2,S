Well, it allows for frequency adjustments, tick adjustments, and offset
adjustments in a single call or just the singleshot (adjtime)
adjustment. However it does not give multiple scaling factors for
different intervals, so you are correct there.

Well, I guess a component of the adjustment would end at a specified
time, that's true.

No, sorry, you are correct there, I was confusing things. 
It may work, and I had considered a similar idea when developing my
solution, but it seemed far too ugly and complicated. But that could
have just been my fault. :)
