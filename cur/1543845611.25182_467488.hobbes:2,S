You deleted part of my message where I show exactly that:
a common function, which handles 80% of usage cases.
You are trying to cover all possible cases with this monstrosity:
extern char *__dev_addr6_fmt(char* buf, const unsigned char *addr);
#define DEV_ADDR6_FMT "%s" /* expands to: "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF" */
#define DEV_ADDR6_BUF char __dev_addr6_buf[sizeof("FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF")]
#define DEV_ADDR6(addr) __dev_addr6_fmt(__dev_addr6_buf,(const unsigned char*)addr)
#define DEV_ADDR6_BUF_2 char __dev_addr6_buf_2[sizeof("FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF")]
#define DEV_ADDR6_2(addr) __dev_addr6_fmt(__dev_addr6_buf_2,(const unsigned char*)addr)
#define DEV_ADDR6_BUF_3 char __dev_addr6_buf_3[sizeof("FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF")]
#define DEV_ADDR6_3(addr) __dev_addr6_fmt(__dev_addr6_buf_3,(const unsigned char*)addr)
#define DEV_ADDR6_BUF_4 char __dev_addr6_buf_4[sizeof("FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF")]
#define DEV_ADDR6_4(addr) __dev_addr6_fmt(__dev_addr6_buf_4,(const unsigned char*)addr)
Usage:
DEV_ADDR6_BUF;
...
printk(", h/w address " DEV_ADDR6_FMT "\n", DEV_ADDR6(dev->dev_addr));
Why don't you use a parameter for DEV_ADDR6{_BUF}? DEV_ADDR6_BUF(var_name).
DEV_ADDR6(var_name, addr). That would be less cryptic.
In my case, it's just
print_mac(", h/w address ", dev->dev_addr, "\n");
Actually, I think it makes sense to have both: yours for complicated
cases (printk with lots of other %something) and mine for simple ones
(no local variable, smaller code).

Maybe. Doesn't look obvious, but if it is in standards...
