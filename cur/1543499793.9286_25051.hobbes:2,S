Subject: [2.2.10] AHA2940U2W + HP35480A DDS = trouble

Hello Doug and all linux-kernel subscribers.
After a few days of troubleshooting I have finally come to the
conclusion that something is wrong with the aic7xxx v5.1.17 drivers
included in 2.2.10.
Here's my hardware setup:
- AHA-2940U2W with all termination turned on from the BIOS
- HP35480A DDS tape drive (HP SureStore 5000i)
- connected with a 50pin cable with an active terminator at the other
end of it
The DDS tape drive, cable and terminator work perfectly with an
AHA1542CF controller on another machine. The above setup works perfectly
with Windows 98 and Colorado Backup (shipped with the DDS drive). I
tried verifying the media of a 450MB Seagate ST3550N drive with
AHA-2940U2W BIOS verification tool and it worked (found the bad blocks I
knew of and remapped them).
"mt status", "mt erase", "tar cvf /dev/nst0" all just hang for about 4
hours without producing any output or SCSI errors in the kernel log.
After the 4 hours have passed, there is a single SCSI SCB timeout
message and in the case of tar, an error about write size not being the
tape block size. mt does not produce any output after the timeout is
logged, tar outputs the normal status lines for the first few small
files and a write error message.
A few system information bits:

I first tried using the controller with 2.2.5 but as it failed with the
same symptoms, I upgraded to 2.2.10 with no luck.
I think the Adaptec BIOS version is 2.01, but i'm not 100% sure on that
as I'd have to reboot to see it and it's not possible for me to do so at
the moment.
Any help/advice is welcome.
