Never submitted AFAIK, but regardless...
There is a central problem of multiple 802.11 stacks that I very much 
want to avoid.  linux-wlan-ng, HostAP, madwifi, and one or two others.
I had hoped that HostAP would be submitted, and that could form the 
basis of a common 802.11 stack, but I haven't heard anything about that 
in many weeks.
