Hi,
  yes, I have one GB and SMP kernel. It's interresting that I don't
remember this bug with kernels around 2.4.23 or .24 - just a guess. If
someone would be interrwested, and can check when did it appear for the
first time. Otherwise, will be happy to get your patch. I think the
printk() lines could print out more debug info. For example the contents of
some variables which were passed to preceeding functions ... ;)
