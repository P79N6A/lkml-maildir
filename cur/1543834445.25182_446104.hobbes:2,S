You're right, and I probably went about it wrong.  I had no intention of
putting Christoph in the spot, but I figured this would bring attention
to MM missing from maintainers list.  I was just going to add the
linux-mm list without a maintainer, but I thought that alone wouldn't
still get a maintainer.
OK, is there an actual maintainer for the mm code?  Andrew Morton might
be the best person to ask this to.  Perhaps if someone would like the
job and that person is capable, we can choose an official maintainer for
the mm part of the kernel.

P.S. I once referred to anyone working in MM as a sadomasochist, and
that was because to work in the world of memory management, one must
really enjoy pain. So I can see if no one actually would want the title
of the MM maintainer. Would just the linux-mm be good enough for now?
