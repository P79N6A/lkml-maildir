For 2.4 there's the ipssend command, I doubt that IBM has ported it to
2.6, but whatever made it not work may be fixed, I haven't tried it in
some months, do try it yourself.
If this is useful info, please post back here the results. I have about
30 machines using this hardware, but none on which I can try a 2.6
kernel any more.
