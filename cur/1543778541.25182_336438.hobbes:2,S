Subject: [PATCH] Add text for dealing with "dot releases" to README
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The emergence of so-called "dot releases" that are non-incremental
patches against a base kernel requires different handling of patches
(revert previous patches before applying the newest one). This patch
adds a paragrach to $TOPDIR/README explaining how to do deal with
dot release patches.
The patch is against 2.6.12.3. A possibly too quick glance at
MAINTAINERS didn't show one for README.

+ - If you are upgrading between releases using the stable series patches
+   (for example, patch-2.6.xx.y), note that these "dot-releases" are
+   not incremental and must be applied to the 2.6.xx base tree. For
+   example, if your base kernel is 2.6.12 and you want to apply the
+   2.6.12.3 patch, you do not and indeed must not first apply the
+   2.6.12.1 and 2.6.12.2 patches. Similarly, if you are running kernel
+   version 2.6.12.2 and want to jump to 2.6.12.3, you must first
+   reverse the 2.6.12.2 patch (that is, patch -R) _before_ applying 
+   the 2.6.12.3 patch.

  - Make sure you have no stale .o files and dependencies lying around:
