Hi Greg, Maxim,
2.6.0-test3-mm3 works fine until APM suspend when the USB controller stops
delivering interrupts. (I'll report further when I have USB working again)
However, in 2.6.0-test4, and 2.6.0-test4-mm1, my USB mouse works but the
bluetooth dongle fails. dmesg logs the following
hub 1-0:0: debounce: port 1: delay 100ms stable 4 status 0x101
hub 1-0:0: new USB device on port 1, assigned address 3
PM: Adding info for usb:1-1
PM: Adding info for usb:1-1:0
hci_usb: probe of 1-1:1 failed with error -5
PM: Adding info for usb:1-1:1
hci_usb: probe of 1-1:2 failed with error -5
PM: Adding info for usb:1-1:2
hci_usb_isoc_rx_submit: hci0 isoc rx submit failed urb c4d6c014 err -22
I've done a bit of printk debugging and found that:
error -5 is -EIO, which is returned because the following test in hci_usb.c
triggers:
        if (intf->altsetting[0].desc.bNumEndpoints < 3)
		return -EIO;
during the first probe bNumEndpoints is 2, during the second it equals 0.
The bluetooth dongle is a bluetake bt009.
I can test patches if required.
Charlie
