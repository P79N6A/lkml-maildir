Looks like you're trying to compile an ancient 2.4 kernel with gcc-3.4
or newer. That has zero chance of working.
Since that looks like a RH 2.4.20 kernel, you should probably use
gcc-3.2.3 to compile it. Alternatively you can use gcc-3.4 with the
current 2.4.31 kernel.
Some 2.6-based distributions do have problems running 2.4 kernels:
FC3 needs some minor tweaks (replace udev and module-init-tools with
dev and modutils from FC2) but FC4 is a lost cause due to NPTL.
