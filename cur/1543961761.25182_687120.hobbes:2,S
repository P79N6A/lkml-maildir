The question that remains is what does this mean for users?
How does a user, who wants to enable this 'sound' driver,
learn that they must enable the v4l subsystem in order to
do so?
This is typically why select constructs are used, to not bother the
user with such messy details.
But like we see in this case, it can cause serious implementation
problems if not used properly. :(
