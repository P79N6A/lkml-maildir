Nasty... But adding a big lock around all traversals of the mm->mmap will
hurt like hell. Let's see... The problem is in swap_out_mm(), right? And
it looks for the first suitable page. OK, it looks like we can get a
deadlock only if we call try_to_free_pages() with ->mmap_sem grabbed and
__GFP_WAIT in flags. Umhm... Called only from __get_free_pages() which
sets PF_MEMALLOC... OK, I'll try to look at it.
