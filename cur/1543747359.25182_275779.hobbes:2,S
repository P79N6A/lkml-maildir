Umm. I don't think you even read what I wrote.

Yes. And when we move a definition from linux/foo.h to user/foo.h, we include
them from linux/foo.h..

..which prevents userland breakage during the transition (and is generally what
you want in the kernel anyway).

It's my opinion that it will eventually be deemed beneficial to
separate out everything that has a legitimate reason to be used by
userspace. But I'm not suggesting getting there in one go, what I'm
suggesting is how to get there incrementally. To rehash:
1. create include/user and friends
2. when we run across a troublesome ABI definition:
     create include/user/foo.h and move the definition there
     make sure include/linux/foo.h includes it
     userspace and kernel compile as before
     send a patch
3. repeat step 2 as often as useful
4. add new user ABI always to include/user/
5. if at some point we find that all of userspace builds from
   include/user/ without reference to include/linux/, declare
   include/user the canonical ABI
6. drop #define __KERNEL__, etc..
7. drop any superfluous include/linux -> include/user includes (there
   shouldn't be many)
