The case is nothing really different from having a hole in your file.
There are two pieces to implementing this.  First you create separate
page cache  entries for the cow file and it's original, so the
laziness of mmapped file writes will not bite you..  Second you make
aops -> writepage trigger the actual copy of the file, and have it
return -ENOSPC if you can't do the copy.
If cow links became sufficiently common you might want to dig into
the VFS and make it possible to do the copy when a write-fault occurs.
At which point you could share the page cache until you do a copy.
