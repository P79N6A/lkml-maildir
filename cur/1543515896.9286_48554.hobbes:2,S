Oops!  You're right.  I had thought that the proc filesystem data
structures were only defined if CONFIG_PROC_FS is set, but inspection
of include/linux/proc_fs.h releaved that that is not the case, so
this code should compile in all circumstances.  For the convenience
of any other readers (and Linus?), I have attached the trivial patch
against 2.3.27 below.
