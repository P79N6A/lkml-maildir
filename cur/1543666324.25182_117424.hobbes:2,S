Hi all,
I've pushed my current set of ext3 diffs (against Marcelo's current
tree) to
http://people.redhat.com/sct/patches/ext3-2.4/dev-20030314/
This includes:
00-merged/			diffs recently merged into 2.4
10-core-fixes-other/		misc fixes/tweaks from akpm, adilger
11-core-fixes-sct/		misc fixes/tweaks from sct
20-tytso-updates/		Ted's recent updates
21-updates-sct/			recent sct diffs pending upstream merge
40-iflush-sct/			experimental inode-flush code
50-debug/			archive of debug patches
99-deferred/			stuff being kept around for future consideration
plus
all-patches.tar.gz		tarball of the above
combo-patch-10to21.patch.gz	combo patch of the 10--21 dirs above
The tytso-updates includes all of Ted's recent changes, separated out as
incrementals against the first htree+orlov changes he posted a while
back, so that we can keep track of diffs.  It includes his back-port of
akpm's orlov changes, plus the recent htree and noatime fixes.  Oh, and
it has the requested "+htree+orlov" ext3 version string added.
The combo patch should be equivalent to Ted's latest set of htree+orlov
diffs (except containing a few extra fixes that I'll start pushing
upstream next week), but broken out in a way that makes it easier to
track the individual change history.  It has had only minimal testing so
far.
Cheers,
 Stephen
