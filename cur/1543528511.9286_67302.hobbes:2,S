Subject: CIPE and 2.3.49 (success I believe) (Heads up Russel of Netfilter, Alan  Cox, Dave Miller, Olaf Titz)

I have fixed the problems in CIPE.  It seems the porting was indeed
straightforward and I believe I have completed it.  Below is a section
of code containing a fix by Russell.  You will note I forced it to use
the old code instead of the new code.  Seems there is either a problem
in the method of replacement or in the kernel.  As this section is, it
works perfectly, as far as I can tell in 20 minutes of testing.  Sorry
about the length of this code segment.  Final patches will be sent to
those requesting them and Olaf Titz.
Russell, Alan, David:  I give this to you to help me check and see if
the code Russell sent me is an accurate replacement and/or if there is a
bug in skb_copy_expand, as Russell told me this was supposed to do just
what the CIPE code does.  Please do look into it.  Thank you so much.
