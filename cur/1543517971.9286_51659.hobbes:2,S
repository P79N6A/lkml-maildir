To preserve binary compatibility, you have to account for things like
structure layout and size changes.  One way to do that is to hide structures
behind a pointer, IOW replace structures with a pointer to an opaque
structure.  Access to such strucures is then provided through functions which
can't be inlined without exposing the layout, precisely what you were trying
to avoid.

How do you know?  Have you seen the source code?  Isn't it possible that the
ABI is a contributing factor (to lacklustre performace)?  Okay, that still
doesn't mean that it's impossible to design an ABI that doesn't have a
performance impact.  So, show us your design.
