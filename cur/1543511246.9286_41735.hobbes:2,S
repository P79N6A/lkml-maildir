I thought that most of them would steal some space in
System RAM, re-route memory reads to that memory-range,
and then mark that range as 'used'.
If this is incorrect, how do they work?

On a low memory system, I think I can live with a few
nanosecond delay at shutdown time in favour of a few
pages of extra RAM :-)
