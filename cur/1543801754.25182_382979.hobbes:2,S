Ok, so this is probably a stupid question and it may have been already
discussed but.....
Isn't possible that GCC would/will add an extension (a useful one) similar
to the visibility thing that c++ got in GCC 4.x? It somewhat weird
that we need to mark things static, instead of the contrary (marking
as global the things you want to make global, would be much nicer since
the functions made global would be the "API")
