You need to use HJ Lu's latest-and-greatest knfsd utilities to setup the
export.  You are interested in the rpc.mountd option '--no-nfs-version 3'.
For reasons unknown, the base mountd code advertises NFS v3 services when
they are not actually implemented.
I ran into this problem originally when trying to export a mount to my
ancient DECStation R3000.  My solution was to comment out the offending
code, but HJ was kind enough to turn the bug report into a configurable
feature.
