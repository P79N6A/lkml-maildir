It is partly done!

Wrong, XF68_FBDev has accleration for the NCR77C32BLT which I added
and I know Geert is working on ATY acceleration.

This is wrong, what needs to be done is to make the FBDev server
acceleration aware for all the other cards. In fact I think it
shouldn't be all that hard to merge the SVGA acceleration modules into
the FBDev server - all it takes is someone with the interest, hardware
and time to do it.
FBDev is designed to do things the right way, ie. use acceleration
when it is available (in user space of course!) or just run
non-accelerated when no acceleration is available. It is very similar
to the concept of the SVGA server I'd say except for letting the
kernel deal with mode-switching.
