No kidding. I've got a unusual setup where I've got 3 forms of internet
connections in a single box (one is radio, one is diald on demand, and one
is a half-duplex (RX) cable modem). I make extensive use of the new ip
command, CBQ, and ip's NAT tables.
I've had to resort to problematic hackery to get rid of the darn default
route on the ISDN interface..
My setup is compilcated enough, and it really sucks having to sleep till
the ppp0 interface is up and then delete the route.
