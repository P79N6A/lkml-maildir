I'm perfectly happy with something like "via-agp.c", if it heads off 
potential future trouble. I just don't like the "agpgart_be" thing, it's 
unreadable in the first place, too long in the second, and having a prefix 
(as opposed to a postfix) makes filename completion suck in the third 
place.
Something like "via-agp.c" doesn't have any of those problems, and while
the "agp" is slightly redundant in the directory structure, it's at least
not ugly.
