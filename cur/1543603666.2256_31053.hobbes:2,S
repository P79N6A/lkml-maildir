The issue is that right now we're going to _check_ for OOM each time
kswapd_balance_pgdat is not able to make all zones have enough free
pages: That is way too fragile (I submitted the patch to Linus saying that
it was just a previa, and he included it anyway.. :))
        do {
                need_more_balance = 0;
                pgdat = pgdat_list;
                do
                        need_more_balance |= kswapd_balance_pgdat(pgdat);
                while ((pgdat = pgdat->node_next));
                if (need_more_balance && out_of_memory()) {
                        oom_kill();
                }
        } while (need_more_balance);
Note that a full kswapd_balance_pgdat() is going to scan only a small
portion of the lists. I'm pretty sure we have to guarantee kswapd scanned
at least all lists (maybe scanned all lists twice), before checking for
OOM.
I guess I'll not be able to write a patch to give us that behaviour
_today_, but I'll do so Monday if nobody else does.
