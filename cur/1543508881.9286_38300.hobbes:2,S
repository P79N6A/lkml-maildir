Configure scripts tend to break when moving from SMP to UP kernels.
This has been discussed several times.
Solution:
cd /usr/src/linux
cp .config .config.backup
make mrproper
cp .config.backup .config
make oldconfig
make dep
etc
Don't forget to compile the modules.
Also if you only have one processor (even if you have a SMP motherboard)
you shouldn't be running a SMP kernel (only because of permormance issues)
