There may be only one dirty page in the whole system and it may be the
one backed by FUSE. Now yes, if it was not backed by FUSE, I would be in
trouble -- but the OOM killer would get me out. It will *NOT* get me out
with fuse, because it thinks the page will be cleaned, which it won't.
Thus by limiting the numeber of pages, you decrease the probability that
the deadlock will happen. You may even get to reasonably small numbers.
But you can't get to 0. The deadlock will still be there, it will just
be unlikely.
