Why not something like this?
1. In Kconfig
config FB_SBUSLIB
tristate
default n
Then all the sbus drivers will have this:
select FB_SBUSLIB
and atyfb will have this
select FB_SBUSLIB if SPARC64 && COMPAT
2. In Makefile
obj-$(CONFIG_FB_SBUSLIB)  += sbuslib.o
3. In sbuslib.h
#ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT
int sbusfb_compat_ioctl(...);
#else
#define sbusfb_compat_ioctl NULL;
#endif
This way, we can also eliminate all the #ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT in all the
cg* drivers and atyfb.
