Yes, I noticed only a couple of hotplug drivers seem to be using MSI,
and no one is using multiple vector support.  My motivation is
twofold.  First, because my device can generate interrupts for
different reasons, and I'm noticing that doing the MMIO read to the
cause register is taking a lot of time, so I'm wondering whether
avoiding this by having separate MSI-X messages will be a win.
Second, for the fun of trying it :)

First patch coming up now :)
