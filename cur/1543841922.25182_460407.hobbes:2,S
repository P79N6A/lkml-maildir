The problems tend to happen when the thread leader exits while one of the 
sub-threads is being traced, and the tracer thread ends up being 
re-parented to be the child of the traced thread (or something like that - 
I forget the exact details).
There was also some problem with the tracer doing an exit() without 
detaching, or something. 
We may have fixed most of the problems since - Oleg has certainly been 
cleaning up some of this, and it's possible that the problems we had are 
ok now. 
Even back when it was broken, _normal_ use never showed the problem (ie no 
well-behaved ptrace use would cause anything bad to happen). But the 
breakage was a local DoS attack, where you could either force an oops or a 
unkillable process, I forget which.
There was an exploit for at least one of the exploits, so maybe somebody 
could test that exploit together with the one-line revert.
That said, it sounds like both of the people who ever noticed this are 
reasonably happy with their work-arounds, so I'm hoping we can simply 
decide not to care, and just keep doing the simpler "you can't ptrace your 
own thread group" thing. That rule simply avoids a lot of special cases.
