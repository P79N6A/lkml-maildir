yeah, i like this one. If the problem is "too long locked section", then
the most natural solution is to "break up the lock", not to "boost the 
priority of the lock-holding task" (which is what the proposed patch 
does).
[ Also note that "sprinkle the code with preempt_disable()" kind of
  solutions, besides hurting interactivity, are also a pain to resolve 
  in something like PREEMPT_RT. (unlike say a spinlock, 
  preempt_disable() is quite opaque in what data structure it protects, 
  etc., making it hard to convert it to a preemptible primitive) ]

agreed.
What we could also add is a /reverse/ mechanism to the scheduler: a task 
could query whether it has just a small amount of time left in its 
timeslice, and could in that case voluntarily drop its current lock and 
yield, and thus give up its current timeslice and wait for a new, full 
timeslice, instead of being forcibly preempted due to lack of timeslices 
with a possibly critical lock still held.
But the suggested solution here, to "prolong the running of this task 
just a little bit longer" only starts a perpetual arms race between 
users of such a facility and other kernel subsystems. (besides not being 
adequate anyway, there can always be /so/ long lock-hold times that the 
scheduler would have no other option but to preempt the task)
