Hello,
I have had this laptop reliably running Linux 2.0.36 for sometime now.
As soon as I booted 2.2.14, after loading apmd it come up with a message
like the following:
spurious APIC interrupt on CPU#0, unexpected interrupt.
and then it completely crashed rock solid.
So, I suddenly remembered I had SMP support on, so I recompiled, and
rebooted. Everything seemed to be fine, except pcmcia didn't work
properly. I recompiled pcmcia-modules (I thought I did this earlier,
but may have forgotten to re-install), and everything seemed pretty
much OK.
However, now, when I reboot 2.2.14, the computer locks up after
loading pcmcia (the exact spot changes), with no indication of what
went wrong.
So now, I am going to completely recompile the kernel and modules from
scratch (the clock gained 6 hours on one reboot, it is possible this
might have messed up my previous build - I doubt it though).
If that doesn't work, I will try to go back down to 2.0.36, not sure
about this yet though (I need to get PCMCIA support going, too, and
the latest gcc compiler I have installed doesn't seem to work with
Linux 2.0.36).
Any ideas?
Thanks in advance.
