Shawn, I'd suggest you tell the said sales guy that IF he can get you
the FULL specs TOGETHER WITH permission to freely distribute them, AND
"a friend of yours who knows how to read such specs" confirms that
they are indeed FULL specs, then you'll consider buying some of the
cards, but if not, you're not interested...
Best wishes from Riley.
