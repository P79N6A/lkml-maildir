Okay, that makes sense. However, this can still work with minimal change
to the 2D module if the next revision passes in the version information
to the kernel module. It doesn't solve the 4.0 to 4.1 transition, but it
still puts the module on a (better?) track. For the 4.0/4.1 modules,
that would have to be a compile time decision or option in the
/etc/modules.conf (options radeon version=x.y.z). Actually, having an
override in the modules.conf would be pretty handy in general.
Also, if you don't want to make changes to the 2D code, the modules.conf
scenario still makes it feasible all around.
