In your case, apparently the (static) routing info  changes every now 
and then, and you see the redirects getting flushed. In another case, 
the "redirect" may become invalidated, and if the kernel would have
put the redirect into the routing table, the system would not
recover, and keep on sending packets to the wrong router.
