Verified.  2.6.11-rc3-bk2 does indeed build, and the result is chugging 
through my big compile script.  It seems to be working fine, although ye olde 
display glitch is still there:
binutils-2.14/ld/testsuite/ld-sparc/tlssunbin64.rd
binutils-2.14/ld/testsuite/lde/ld-/ld-sld-spd-spa-sparsparcparc/arc/trc/tlc/tls/tlsstlssulssunssunbsunbiunbinnbin6bin64in64.n64.s64.s4.s.ss

binutils-2.14/ld/testsuite/ld-sparc/tlssunbin64.td
But that's a purely cosmetic bug.
Thanks,
Rob
