The page table trickery is actually the more invasive approach.  I believe
for 32 bit kernels the real problem is giving up the identity mapping of
low memory.  Short of the moving the kernel to end of the address space
where vmalloc and the fixmaps are now I don't think there is a reasonable chunk
of the address space we can use.
