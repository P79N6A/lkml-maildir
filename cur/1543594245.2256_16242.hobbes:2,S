Hi,
Wait a minute...
Spinlocks on a embedded system? Is it _really_ SMP?
What kind of performance problem do you have?
My guess, since you are mentioning spin locks, is that you are
having a latency problem - RT process does not execute/start
quickly enough?
If that is the case you should look at Andrew Mortons low latency
patches.
