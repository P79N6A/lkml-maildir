But in head.S we set the NE flag in CR0 for all 486 or better
processors, so the MSDOS compatibility mode is not used, and we don't
need to care about this race.

Looked at your patch...  I was also thinking about something similar.
You treat exception 16 and IRQ13 the same - is this really correct?
Asynchronous IRQ13 might break things.  But this would be visible only
on a real 80386+80387 - does someone still have such hardware? ;)
