SInce the kernel works, I never thought these were severe problems. :-)
I doubt that -W will ever be useful for a release kernel; there's just too
much noise. For a verification build, however, it's extremely useful.
The next step is to look into the 900+ "comparison between signed and unsigned
quantities." Most of them are probably harmless but if a negative signed
quantity is ever compared to an  unsigned quantity you've got problems.
