Nope. I was wary of compiler warnings. I'll try removing this first
assignment. However, the variable is necessary for another
notify_watchers() call later in the function. I introduced it because I
didn't think wrapping the function call like this:
WARN_ON(notify_watchers(WATCH_TASK_FREE, tsk) & NOTIFY_STOP_MASK);
would be very readable.

Seems like a good idea. I'll make the necessary changes.
