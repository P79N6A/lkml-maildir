Hi David
                   Thanks for the reply. I am sorry that I misspelled the
line(__asm__(....)). It is from the get_current() function in
asm-i386/current.h. But I am not clear what is the whole meaning of that
line(__asm__(..)) in get_current(). I am doing a project in Linux related to
VFS. From VFS. this function is called to get the base of the file system. I
am not getting how this function will gave the base of the file system.
get_current() is called from lookup_dentry function.
             base=dget(current->fs->root)
 
Thanks in advance
                         by
                           Blesson
