Warning! This might be a stupid question.
Is it safe to modify the read() entry of a driver's file_operations struct
in order to modify the behaviour of the driver depending upon some context,
say a particular hardware mode.  Or is the only way to do this safely to
test the current mode in read() adding overhead to the function.
Ta,
