P4 2.4HT with 1GB of ram - could be me, but things seem to start a
tad quicker.  If I however push it with two 'make -j12' compiles that
normally works fine, it goes for about 10-15mins, and then OOM killer
kills X, evo, galeon, etc.
Must note that for most of the time free memory stays in the region of
450-650mb and then suddenly things goes for the worse.  Also, after this
there is only about 80MB used ...  If I then start X, etc again, same
thing after 10-15 mins - the box thus never died, just suddenly all free
memory was taken.
If you need any stats, etc, let me know.
BTW, kernel is 2.5.74-bk7.
