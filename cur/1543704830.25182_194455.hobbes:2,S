Hi, 
the 2.6 behaviour of the root-path option seems to have changed: in 2.4
it was possible to do this in the DHCP configuration:
	option root-path "192.168.1.1:/path/to/root";
to specify an NFS server other than the TFTP boot server where the
kernel comes from; in 2.6 the code in ipconfig.c which parses this
option for the IP address has been removed. 
Was this done on purpuse or by accident? What's the "correct" way to
specify the address? 
Robert
