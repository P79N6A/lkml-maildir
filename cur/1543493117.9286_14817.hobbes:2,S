Ok, did that in a machine where the Cyclom-Y board is assigned the proper
address (i.e., the address type it has requested):
- Before:
                pcibios_read_config_dword(cyy_bus, cyy_dev_fn,
                                  PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_2,
                                  (unsigned int *) &cy_pci_addr2);
- After:
                pcibios_read_config_dword(cyy_bus, cyy_dev_fn,
                                  PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_2,
                                  (unsigned int *) &cy_pci_addr2);
printk("got 0x%lx ; ", cy_pci_addr2);
cy_pci_addr_tmp = cy_pci_addr2;
cy_pci_addr2 |= 0x01;
                pcibios_write_config_dword(cyy_bus, cyy_dev_fn,
                                  PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_2,
                                  cy_pci_addr2);
printk("wrote 0x%lx ; ", cy_pci_addr2);
                pcibios_read_config_dword(cyy_bus, cyy_dev_fn,
                                  PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_2,
                                  (unsigned int *) &cy_pci_addr2);
printk("got 0x%lx\n", cy_pci_addr2);
cy_pci_addr2 = 0xffffffff;
                pcibios_write_config_dword(cyy_bus, cyy_dev_fn,
                                  PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_2,
                                  cy_pci_addr2);
printk("wrote 0x%lx ; ", cy_pci_addr2);
                pcibios_read_config_dword(cyy_bus, cyy_dev_fn,
                                  PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_2,
                                  (unsigned int *) &cy_pci_addr2);
printk("got 0x%lx\n", cy_pci_addr2);
                pcibios_write_config_dword(cyy_bus, cyy_dev_fn,
                                  PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_2,
                                  cy_pci_addr_tmp);
                pcibios_read_config_dword(cyy_bus, cyy_dev_fn,
                                  PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_2,
                                  (unsigned int *) &cy_pci_addr2);
Results:
Cyclades driver 2.1.2.1 1999/04/08 16:17:18
        built Apr 16 1999 14:52:03
got 0xe0310000 ; wrote 0xe0310001 ; got 0xe0310000
wrote 0xffffffff ; got 0xffffc000
Cyclom-Y/PCI #1: 0x2e88000-0x2e8bfff, IRQ15, 16 channels starting from 
port 0.
That has shown that, at least by using the Linux kernel PCI interface
commands (pcibios_read/write_config), I'm not able to change that bit.
Furthermore, it has shown that I can't write to the last 14 bits [13-0] of
the base address register.
Again, this was done in a machine where the Cyclom-Y board is assigned the
proper address (i.e., the address type it has requested). Do you think
that this test would yell a different result if run on the "deffective"
system ??
