I would have thought you'd have a Linux guest, and a hard-RT guest
both running on a nanokernel. But for the purposes of this discussion
it probably isn't a huge difference.

You could probably have some sort of RT graphics drawing facility,
but I think X11 wouldn't be it :P

Run RT programs in your RT kernel, and GP programs in your Linux
kernel. The only time one will have to cross into the other domain
is when they want to communicate with one another.

That may be a complex problem, but it really doesn't get any simpler
when doing it with a single kernel: all those subsystems still have
to be contended with.
But it's getting a little hand-wavy, I think someone would have to
really be at death's door before trusting Linux (even with PREEMPT_RT)
and XFS to give hard RT IO guarantees any time in the next 5 or 10
years.
What I would do, I would write a block driver in the nanokernel, and
write host drivers for both the Linux and the RT kernel. The nanokernel
would give priority to RT kernel requests. Now its up to the RT kernel
to provide guarantees. Job done. (Well OK, that's very handwavy too,
but I think it is a solution that might actually be attainable, unlike
Linux XFS :)).

Well yeah, the RT kernel is going to have to implement all features
that it needs to provide. I just happen to be of the (naive) opinion
that adding functionality to a hard-RT kernel would be far easier
than adding hard-RT to the Linux kernel.
And not just from the technical "can it be done" sense, but you'll
probably end up fighting the non-RT kernel devs every step of the
way. So even if you had the perfect patchset there, it would probably
take years to merge it all, if ever.
[snip, making the Linux kernel hard-rt]
Yeah it is probably possible given enough time and effort, I grant
you that.

If your RT kernel has a TCP/IP stack, then I guess the call chain is
socket(2) ;)

Well, you would do the RT work in the RT kernel, then communicate
the results to the Linux kernel.

It isn't clear to me yet. I'm sure you can make your interrupt
latencies look good, as with your scheduling latencies. But when
you talk about doing _real_ work, that will require an order of
magnitude more changes than the PREEMPT_RT patch to make Linux
hard-RT. And everyone will need to know about it, from device
driver writers and CPU arch code up.

But just what is a non-deterministic operation in Linux? It is
hard to know.
Suppose the PREEMPT_RT patch gets merged tomorrow. OK, now what
if *you* needed a realtime TCP/IP socket. Where will you begin?

Sorry, not much better... But don't waste too much time on me, and
thanks, I appreciate the time you've given me so far.
I wouldn't consider a non response (or a late response) to mean that
a point has been conceeded, or that I've won any kind of argument :-)
Best,
Nick
