Uh, untarring is the operation that needs to be non-root. So just have
a build user or some other non-root user do the untarring and building
(which is recommended by most anyways, IIRC). Then, as root (or via
sudo) make modules_install install.

Again, you pretty clearly can *compile* a kernel as boot. root is only
needed for install (and this is the division of tasks that I use and
recommend to others).
Thanks,
