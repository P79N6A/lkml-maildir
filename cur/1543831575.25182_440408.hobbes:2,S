A company called Isilon does this on a cluster.  They claim (IIRC) a one 
hour rebuild time for a failure.  AFAIK they rebuild into cluster free 
space, so they are not bound by the spare's bandwidth; they can utilize 
all cluster resources for a rebuild.
(You don't need spare disks, just spare free space; so you don't have 
idle disk heads)
In terms of complexity, I imagine one needs a reverse mapping (extent -> 
(inode, offset)); given that, one can very easily rebuild failed disks, 
and more features are easy to implement, like evacuation of a drive, or 
rebalancing data across all drives when new disks are added.
The same ideas can be applied to a non-clustered filesystem, of course.
