The lowest numbered pid, not currently in use, can be readily obtained
when a task exits. The task exit is currently the slowest thing to do
because of the wait-for-status requirement. Adding a variable and
a comparison at process exit would get the number for free.
A hard-coded number of 300 is an eye-opener.
