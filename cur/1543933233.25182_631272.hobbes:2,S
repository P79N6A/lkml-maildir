 I have a rt2500pci card on an 64 bit system (Ubuntu) AMD X2 processor and i'm
trying latest vanilla kernels i've used a 2.6.24-rc5 kernel without mayor issues
(except that i have to issue a sudo iwconfig wlan0 rate 54M because it allways
connect at 1Mbit and it is dog slow) but now with v2.6.24-rc6-83-g5b825ed i
have my dmesg spammed with:
