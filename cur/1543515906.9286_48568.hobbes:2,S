Subject: linux-2.3.27/drivers/net/net_init.c uses undefined ARPHRD_IEEE802_TR symbol, plus a suggestion to trim net_init.c

	The 2.3.27 token ring initialization code in drivers/net/net_init.c
now references the undefined symbol symbol ARPHRD_IEEE802_TR.  It used
to reference ARPHRD_IEEE802.  I am not sure if this really is supposed
to be a different value or not.
	By the way, in the local kernel tree here, I have moved the
code in drivers/net/net_init.c that is bracketted in "ifdef CONFIG_FC",
"ifdef CONFIG_HIPPI" and "ifconfig CONFIG_TR" to net/802/{fc,tr,hippi}.c,
which are all loadable modules.  This eliminates some ifdefs and moves
more code from the kernel proper into loadable modules (which most people
do not load).  I would encourage this change to be adopted in the mainline
kenrel releases, and I would be happy to submit a patch to implement it
if that would be more convenient.
