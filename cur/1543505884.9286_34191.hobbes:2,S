Sorry I do not get your point here, you are saying that if one wants
to use __writel() then he/she will have to handle byte swapping on big
endian architectures manually? That means if I say write a Gigabit
Ethernet driver and I want to optimize it maximally then I am going to
use __writel() on the x86 and Alphas because those are the machines I
have access to. Now someone wants to use the driver to Linux/PPC and
suddenly all hell breaks lose because __writel() doesn't byteswap so
this person will have to modify the driver in order to make it run at
all.

Yes this will work, but it is going to make it impossible to use
__writel() for traditional PCI access as I described above unless I
define my own versions of writel in the driver to do
#define __l_writel(x,y)   __writel(cpu_to_le32(x),y)

If you read some of my previous postings then you'd remember that I
was arguing for a native byte order in the first place, you were the
one who brought the explicit big endian version into the discussion.
