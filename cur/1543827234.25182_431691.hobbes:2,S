Thanks. memtest86 passes 6 times without errors. Serial console didn't 
show up anything (it just reboots). 
Anyway, I finally suspect the debian libmpeg binary is at fault. I 
manually build it from src and statically linked to the `bkmark' 
program. It seems cured the random reboots problem. It runs 
successfully for 4 times. However, the fifth time it ended up in a `D' 
state. The only system call it uses is libc file IO and some signal 
passing. Any comment on the cause?
