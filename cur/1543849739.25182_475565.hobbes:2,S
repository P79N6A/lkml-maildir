Subject: [patch] Makefile: cancel implicit rules on included and top makefiles.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/22/62

 `make -d help | grep Makefile` shows patterns, where make tries to rebuild
 included and top makefiles.
 Do not let make to do so, by canceling implicit rules on this files.
 This must apply for all kinds of top makefiles's targets: *config, *build.
