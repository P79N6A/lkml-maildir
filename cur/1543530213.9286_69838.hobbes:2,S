In the interest of portability, I don't know if this is correct (I
may be wrong, though...). While I've never worked on a system where
the suggested macros wouldn't work, maybe there are machines out
there (1's complement rather than 2's complement, or sign/magnitude)
where these macros will give plain wrong answers. I'm not sure there's
any portable way to write a macro that covers all possible cases.
Maybe that's why they haven't been provided already...

P.S. as an example, if you're rusty on number representations:
	bit pattern	2's comp	1's comp	sign/mag
	===========	========	========	========
	10000000	-128		-127		-0
        10000001	-127		-126		-1
	...
	11111110	-2		-1		-126
	11111111	-1		-0		-127
