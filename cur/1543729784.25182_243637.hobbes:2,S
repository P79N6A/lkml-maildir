In some ways, whether we are doing a "crash dump" reboot or a "normal"
kexec reboot is determined by the command line parameters that are
passed to the kexec loaded kernel. If we do not restrict the memory
size and do not add the keyword "dump" in the command line, it will do 
a normal kexec reboot. The dump file will not show up in the second kernel.

A way to disable kexec reboot from panic code is indeed needed. I will
add the necessary code to do this.

Will work on the necessary changes so we can use your patchset.
