The change:
+#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
+#define __INIT		.section	".text","ax"
+#define __INITDATA	.section	".data","aw"
+#else
 #define __INIT		.section	".init.text","ax"
-#define __FINIT		.previous
 #define __INITDATA	.section	".init.data","aw"
+#endif
+#define __FINIT		.previous
breaks ARM, since the ARM startup code moves from the start of the image
to somewhere in the middle of the kernel image.  (That's trivially fixable.)
Besides that, this change is also wrong because not all assembly marked
__INIT needs to be moved into the standard .text segment when hotplug CPU
is enabled.  Ditto for __INITDATA.
One is left wondering why the original patch proposers didn't:
1. Invent __CPUINIT and __CPUINITDATA, to be consistent with __init vs
   __cpuinit.
2. copy other architecture maintainers.
Shall I invent __CPUINIT to mark data to always be thrown away, or are
the x86 folk going to withdraw this patch and do it properly?
