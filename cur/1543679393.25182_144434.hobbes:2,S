Subject: [PATCH SET - 2/3] linux-2.5.73_lost-tick-speedstep-fix_A1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	This patch is a modification of the lost-tick-speedstep-fix patch in
2.5.73-mm2.
The patch tries to resolve issues caused by running the TSC based lost
tick compensation code on CPUs that change frequency (speedstep, etc). 
Should the CPU be in slow mode when calibrate_tsc() executes, the kernel
will assume we have so many cycles per tick.  Later when the cpu speeds
up, the kernel will start noting that too many cycles have past since
the last interrupt.  Since this can occasionally happen, the lost tick
compensation code then tries to fix this by incrementing jiffies. Thus
every tick we end up incrementing jiffies many times, causing timers to
expire too quickly and time to rush ahead.
This patch detects when there has been 100 consecutive interrupts where
we had to compensate for lost ticks.  If this occurs, we spit out a
warning and fall back to using the PIT as a time source.
I've tested this on my speedstep enabled laptop with success, and others
laptop users seeing this problem have reported it works for them.  Also
to ensure we don't fall back to the slower PIT too quickly, I tested the
code on a system I have that looses ~30 ticks about every second and it
can still manage to use the TSC as a good time source.  
This solves most of the "time doubling" problems seen on laptops.
Additionally this revision has been modified to use the cleanups made in
rename-timer_A1.
Please consider for inclusion in your tree.
thanks
