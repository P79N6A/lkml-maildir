Then please try to inform yourself in order to understand that you are wrong.
libscg abstracts from a kernel specific transport and allows to write OS 
independent applications that rely in generic SCSI transport.
For this reason, it is bejond the scope of the Linux kernel team to decide on 
this abstraction layer. The Linux kernel team just need to take the current
libscg interface as given as _this_  _is_ the way to do best abstraction.
The Linux kernel team has the freedom to boycott portable user space SCSI 
applications or to support them.
