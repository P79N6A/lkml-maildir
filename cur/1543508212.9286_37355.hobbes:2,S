Guys, thanks for all the replies.  I am the original poster in this thread.
Interesting discussion.
Just so everyone understands my problem:
0. This problem is only present on Linux mounted vfat partitions.
1. I am using amanda 2.4.1p1 under Linux (GNUTAR) on *all* nodes.
2. All win9[58] partitions are mounted *read-only* on *all* clients.
3. My setup has worked very well for me for over two years.
4. All kernels prior to and including 2.2.10 gave me no problems.
5. Incrementals now always back up the entire partition with kernels 2.2.1[12].
6. Nothing else, including GNUTAR, has changed.
So the question is, what changed in VFAT support from 2.2.10->2.2.11?
Is there some magic switch I can use to revert to legacy behavior?
Normally I don't come here begging for help, but this time I am stuck.
Rolling back to 2.2.10 does not help me or other amanda users long term.
Suggestions on what I should try?  mount -o noatime didn't seem to help.
I really do appreciate everyone's advice.  Thanks all.
