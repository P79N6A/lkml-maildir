  Actually the thing (DAC960-PL, one ibm 10k rpm drive) just booted up and
worked like a charm. Indeed it`s not a hardcore setup, yet i`m happy
anyway :-)
  Although i`ll keep running 2.4 until alsa isapnp breakage will get fixed up.
  Anyhow thank you for the finally working driver which finally enabled me
to check bloody 2.5 at home :-)
