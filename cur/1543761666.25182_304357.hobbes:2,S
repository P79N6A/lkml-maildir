Running your program here I see even worse values than that on 2.6.11-mm4 
and it's also interresting to see that for a lot of continuous runs the 
values reported drop steadily and eventually settle around ~1100, but if I 
insert a  sleep 1  between runs, then I see a steady ~1000 reported.
This is all with HZ = 1000
