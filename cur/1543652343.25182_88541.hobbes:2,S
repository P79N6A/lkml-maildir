Subject: [RFC] i386/unistd.h incomprehensible comment?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The following comment needs to be updated since it seems to be out of
date (fork is not actually declared here) and hard to read.
Don't know the history of this, or what is correct comment would be, but
this seems wrong.
------------------------------------------------------------
in include/asm-i386/unistd.h
#ifdef __KERNEL_SYSCALLS__
/*
 * we need this inline - forking from kernel space will result
 * in NO COPY ON WRITE (!!!), until an execve is executed. This
 * is no problem, but for the stack. This is handled by not letting
 * main() use the stack at all after fork(). Thus, no function
 * calls - which means inline code for fork too, as otherwise we
 * would use the stack upon exit from 'fork()'.
 *
 * Actually only pause and fork are needed inline, so that there
 * won't be any messing with the stack from main(), but we define
 * some others too.
