To be precise, this applies *kprobes*-based probes only.  In
acceptance of this fragility, systemtap includes constructs (aliases,
version-dependent conditionals) to make it reasonably easy to adapt to
different kernel versions.

Yes.

That latter point has been repeatedly overstated.  Markers provides a
fixed set of values.  kprobes/dwarf provides access to any statements
and any values (including locals) that a compiler did not altogether
elide.  While the latter set is by its nature variable, it will be
much bigger than anything a reasonable set of markers will ever
expose.

Right, not as a whole, but it *could* be an alternative way to hook
into system call type events.

Thank you.  Our team is already in contact to help.
