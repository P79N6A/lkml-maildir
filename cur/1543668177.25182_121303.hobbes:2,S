I like uniformity.
Either all eth cards should have their address in dmesg, or none.
Almost all do.
And: ifconfig does not give the card types.
So presently one needs both boot messages and ifconfig.
And: in some situations the system does not boot because of
eth numbering mixup, and one never gets the opportunity to
ask ifconfig.
