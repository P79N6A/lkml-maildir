glibc presents the glibc ABI to its client applications, and
uclibc presents the uclibc ABI to its clients.  If they choose to
process things a bit before communicating with their clients that
is their business.  But that is certainly not a problem for the
kernel developer's to worry about.
The means by which the various C libs present their own ABI to
their clients is also their private business.  If the kernel
developers can provide a clean ABI to user space that is not
mingled with kernel internals, you can be sure the various C lib
developers will be overjoyed to use that for kernel communication
and will gladly address any needed ABI translation.
