If it still fails with the latest BIOS (11.0)
http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/server/se7501br2/
Please be encouraged to file a bug at bugzilla.kernel.org
Component: ACPI
Owner: linux-acpi@unix-os.sc.intel.com
If you can drop in the good/bad dmesg, lspci, and /proc/interrupts,
That would be great.
Thanks,

Ps. If it is an ACPI interrupt config problem, it should boot also with
pci=noacpi
