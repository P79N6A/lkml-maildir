Btw, looks like the whole idea is broken.  Consider a block of
known-plaintext.  The known plaintext happens to be at the beginning
of the block and has more entropy than the blocksize of your block
cypher.  Bang, you're dead.
Your whole approach depends on the fact, that any known plaintext in
the device is either not at the beginning of the block or has very
little entropy.  1k of zeroes already has too much entropy if you use
any form of huffman, so without RLE you're not frequently dead, but
practically always.
Does the idea still sound sane to you?
