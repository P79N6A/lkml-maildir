Machine had .5GB total, not surehow much was really used.

Okay, I started galeon (no opera here :-(), evolution, xpdf,
oowriter. Well, it is not going to be too much "apples-to-apples"
since swsusp1 cheats and discards caches (etc). Machine has 1GB memory
total, before suspend attempt 800MB were in use. Suspend took 20
seconds, after resume (and some swap-in) 250MB was in use.

I'm not sure if I want to do full page-cache saving (and without that,
half-of-memory limit does not bite too badly). "Everything is swapped
out" problem is actually not limited to swsusp, updatedb overnight
tends to have the same effect. Perhaps more generic solution is
needed...
cat `cat /proc/[0-9]*/maps | grep / | sed 's:.* /:/:' | sort -u` > /dev/null
does solve part of the problem. (Another problem is how to actually
measure improvements in this area).
