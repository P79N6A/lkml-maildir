Hi,
thanks for finding bugs in this patch. Although this path will likely
never happen, this is good to have it bug-free.

Particularly in vtbl.c there is no good reason. Leftover of itsy-bitsy
units. I'll make ubi_scan_add_to_list static, as well as
ubi_scan_add_used(). And I'll rename them to something shorter. They are
only useful in scan.c.
And it is fine to use list_add_tail() directly in vtbl.c. Will be fixed.

In scan.c it is useful because _all_ callers have to allocate it. vtbl.c
is the only place which does not need it. I'll fix this.

What is wrong with the semantics, please be more specific.
I'll fix this shortly.
