Subject: [patch 36/38] CKRM e18: Classification Engine Configuration Support cleanup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Make the configuration interface more accurately reflect the relationship between RBCE and CRBCE. Only the following 4 configurations are allowed:
  | CONFIG_RBCE | CONFIG_CRBCE |
--+-------------+--------------|
1 |      m      |       m      |
2 |      y      |       n      |
3 |      n      |       y      |
4 |      n      |       n      |
