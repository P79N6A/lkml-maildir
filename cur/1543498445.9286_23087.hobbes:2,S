As promised, the failure from a 2.2.10-pre-3 build for an SMP rawhide
system (follows).  The same configuration sans SMP builds fine.  Looking
at the SMP patches that Richard Henderson has put out, it looks like
some elements of those patches are in here, but others aren't, causing
the compilation failures.  If I have time (heh, yeah...) I'll try to
piece together what's going on and see if I can fix it up.  Anyway...the
compilation errors:
...
