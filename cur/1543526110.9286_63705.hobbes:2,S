Hi Ted, thanks for the reply...

This never happened before I upgraded to MySQL 3.22.30 and Apache 1.3.11
several days ago... hmm.
It seems to be a sudden thing. In fact yesterday I found 3 mysqld's each
eating 25% of the CPU, and I had 80MB swap usage. I waited 10 minutes and
they were still going -- I killed them and MySQL continued to function fine.
I'll try 3.22.32...
Thanks again
Simon Garner
