Would anyone like to give me a helping hand in implementing the
getpeereid() syscall for Linux?  See the following page for the
documentation of the OpenBSD implementation:
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=getpeereid&sektion=2&apropos=0&manpath=OpenBSD
+Current
I think I could work out the kernel data structures to gather the
relevant data from, however, I won't get all the locking stuff right.
OTOH, is there any chance that the addition of such a syscall would be
accepted?
Thanks to /proc, it is possible to implement the user ID part of the
syscall in userland, at least for TCP sockets, but this isn't enough.
(I've got a such an implementation which seems to work quite well,
just in case you are interested.)
