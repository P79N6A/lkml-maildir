I'm applying this patch with some minor cleanups of my own.
I went and then checked around for atm_find_dev() users to
make sure they held the atm_dev_lock, and I discovered several pieces
of "hidden treasure".
Firstly, have a look at net/atm/common.c:atm_ioctl() and how it
accesses userspace while holding atm_dev_lock.  That is just the
tip of the iceberg.
ATM sorely needs a maintainer.  Any of the kernel janitors want to
learn how ATM works? :-))))
