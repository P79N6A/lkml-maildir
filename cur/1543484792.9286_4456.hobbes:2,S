FINALLY someone understood what I ment... everyione was trying to tell me
stuff like cp /var/log/dmesg SOMEPATH/file or dmesg > file
But what I really ment is that how do I recover the messages from the
beginning of the booting kernel which are lost because of the big quantity
of kernel messages driver messages & stuff if I use a big monolitic kernel
in a fully loaded hardware with plenty of different hardware that needs
initializations, drivers => messages... + if you have a frame buffer card
compiled into the kernel you'll loose from the buffer the data that was
written on the screen in text mode before the fb driver switches to the
emulated (graphic actually) text mode...
Yes that was my ideea too, modifying the dmesg buffer in the kernel and
maybe dmesg needs to be patched also to read all that dmesg data... :)
Unfortunately I am not a kernel hacker so I expect you to do all this
explained above, I just pointed this out. It depends on you if you think
that it should be fixed or it is left to drop... ;)
	I love you guys, all! Keep up the good job at this WONDERFULL OS!
PS: total success on a iP MMX 233 UP, 96mb ram, SCSI NCR53C825 + ide hdd
& CDROM, Digi PC/64Xe / 16 ports - linux 2.2.1
Yess finally I managed to initialize and put to work my big old
Digiboard. Thanks to many of you out there.
