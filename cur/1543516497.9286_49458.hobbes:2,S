Perhaps this is not the place to ask this question. But I'm at a loss for
what else could be the problem other than the kernel and/or the compiler.
At the end of this message you'll see the actual bug report that has been
filed with the PHP developers. I'm just looking for someone to point me in
the right direction. What is particularly frustrating about this problem
is that it should, by all accounts, WORK!
The meat of it is.. PHP 3.0.12 w/ the OpenLink drivers (--openlink) causes
a segfault under 2.2.x kernels. The OpenLink drivers themselves, work
fine. I.E. I'm able to build C applications that utilize them on the
platform without a problem.
PHP 3.0.12 works with --openlink on 2.0.x kernels (RH 5.2). I'm using them
in a production setting with great success.
So.. why would they work on 2.0 but not 2.2 kernels? Am I just insane?
Thoughts? Pointers? I'm all ears...
