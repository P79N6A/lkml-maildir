I sent this .. 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/2/299
last month which shrinks task struct by 480 bytes when lockdep
is enabled. Ingo acked it, but then it fell on the floor.
Here it is again..

Shrink the held_lock struct by using bitfields.
This shrinks task_struct on lockdep enabled kernels by 480 bytes.
