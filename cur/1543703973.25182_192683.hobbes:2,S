In message <20040120225219.GA19190@elf.ucw.cz> you write:

1) fill_suspend_header never fails, perhaps make it return void.
2) If fill_suspend_header could fail, you should indicate why it won't
   fail here, and
3) BUG_ON(complex condition expression) is much less clear than:
	if (complex condition expression)
		BUG();
Cheers,
Rusty.
