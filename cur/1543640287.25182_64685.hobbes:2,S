you are right, i misread the System.map - cpu_gdt_table is aligned
properly:
  c02a39e0 D cpu_gdt_table
so it must be something else that prevents booting on those boxes. Does 
the boot BIOS code perhaps assume a certain GDT layout? A certain size? 
Does it overwrite certain GDT entries perhaps?

yes. Fortunately this makes no difference, the LDT and the default DS/CS
are in a single cacheline still.
