Well, BIOSes tend to do strange stuff if you enter sleep state with
APIC enabled, and APIC is harder to understand than plain old
PIT. Leave APIC enabled, try to reboot it dies, etc.
PIT may be slightly slower, but not having to debug APIC problems
outweights that.
Anyway I was wrong, I do have it enabled on my main system. Ok, it
seems to work, so I'll probably leave it alone.
