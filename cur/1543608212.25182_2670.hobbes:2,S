Hi,
My cached has been decremented a few too many times on 2.4.14-pre6.  Right
now it's listing cached as "7516", but it was at 4GB not very long ago...
I know that Rik has posted a patch against 2.4.13-ac, but I don't know if
it's meant for 2.4.14-pre6 also...
I've seen another report of the same thing against 2.4.13 and 2.4.13-ac.
Here are the two kernels that I have seen this on (because I haven't tried
any inbetween):
vmlinuz-2.4.13freeswan-1.91+ac5+preempt+netdev_random+vm_freeswap
vmlinuz-2.4.14-pre6+preempt+netdev_random+ext3_0.9.14-2414p5
I'm running the bottom one now with seven hours uptime...
Mike
