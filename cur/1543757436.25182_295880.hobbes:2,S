GPL it is then :)
There are bunch of kprobes/jprobe modules 
Packet tracer module:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/16/179
I have few modules for adding dump_stack()
and collect few stats in various places (mostly
for debugging things). If you really want to see them
I can post.
The routine is used for resolving symbol to address, 
so that we can insert probe point, like ..
+	for (i = 0, nt = nettrace_objs; i < MAX_NETTRACE_ROUTINE; i++, nt++) {
+		nt = &nettrace_objs[i];
+		nt->jp.kp.addr = (kprobe_opcode_t *)
+		    kallsyms_lookup_name(nt->funcname);
+		if (nt->jp.kp.addr) {
+			printk("plant jprobe at %s (%p), handler addr %p\n",
+			       nt->funcname, nt->jp.kp.addr, nt->jp.entry);
+			register_jprobe(&nt->jp);
+		} else {
+			printk("couldn't find %s to plant jprobe\n",
+			       nt->funcname);
+		}
+	}
Thanks,
