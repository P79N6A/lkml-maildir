I don't think so.  pci_scan_bus_parented() happened earlier, here:
[   22.875359] ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI0] (0000:00)
and pcibios_init() is a subsys_initcall() that happens before the PNP
system driver registers via fs_initcall() (I had this order wrong in a
previous email).

There are clearly problems with PNP.  I'm trying to help improve the
situation.

That already happens.

The PNP resource fits entirely inside the PCI bus resource, so the PNP
insertion will only fail if the sound driver has already been loaded.
It seems like we're talking past each other.  Would anybody else like
to step in and help explain this to me?  Maybe a fresh viewpoint will
help me find a clue.
