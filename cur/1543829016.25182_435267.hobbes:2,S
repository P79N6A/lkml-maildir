Good point.  I probably stated that concern too narrowly.  Probably
what I should say is: What is the pre-condition for calling
destroy_context() ?  Is it that init_new_context() must have
succeeded?  Or is it merely that mm.context has been zeroed
out?
Here's destroy context on sparc64:
void destroy_context(struct mm_struct *mm)
{
        unsigned long flags, i;
        for (i = 0; i < MM_NUM_TSBS; i++)
                tsb_destroy_one(&mm->context.tsb_block[i]);
        spin_lock_irqsave(&ctx_alloc_lock, flags);
        if (CTX_VALID(mm->context)) {
                unsigned long nr = CTX_NRBITS(mm->context);
                mmu_context_bmap[nr>>6] &= ~(1UL << (nr & 63));
        }
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ctx_alloc_lock, flags);
}
It seems to assume that mm->context is valid before doing a check.
Since I don't have a sparc64 box, I can't check to see if this
actually breaks things or not.
