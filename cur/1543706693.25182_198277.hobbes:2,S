Yes, so ext3&co. should be equipped with charset options just the other so
it can be fixed by the user or in some cases the mount tools. 
Is there a place to store character set information in these file systems?

Some apps simply don't think non-ascii is relevant. Xmms is one, although
is doesn't crash at least. My guess was that it was a font problem since it
looks like XMMS uses some special fonts. Even new apps (like gedit have 
character set problems. These apps have to be fixed since they don't work
properly anywhere outside the US. But that is a pure userspace problem, not 
a kernel one.
