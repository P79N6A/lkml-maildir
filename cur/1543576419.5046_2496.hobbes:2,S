Hello Everybody
I am trying to mount a filesystem on Linux 2.4.0-test10 kernel using the
mount() function.
When I call this function the system just hangs up.  I have to restart
linux by switching off and on.
Can somebody tell me why mount call just hangs?  Is there anyway to take a
dump when
the call is being executed.
I tried looking for description about mount but couldnt find anything
helpful.  I will really appreciate
if someone can share his/her experience regarding the same.
Thanks and Regards
Swapneel
