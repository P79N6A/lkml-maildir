Please keep the generic boilerplate in a [PATCH 0/6] message, and have a
descriptive body before each individual message that describes it, not
the entire patch series.
Also, perfmon.c is a big source file.  It might help reviewers if it got
split into several source files that had different logical functions.

Why submit dead code?

This looks grotty.  Can't you add the necessary arch support, instead of
an i386-specific hack with a misleading comment?  The block should at
least be "#ifndef __ia64__" to match the comment.

Same "yeugh" response.

This should be in a separate source file, whose compilation is
conditional on CONFIG_IA64_PERFMON_COMPAT.

What's this intended to catch?

I've seen this style of goto usage in the code a few times, and it's
bizarre.  Why are you jumping backwards to the error exit?  There's
nothing wrong with using a goto to exit, it's just more usual to have a
single section at the end of the function that has both the error and
normal exit paths.
In fact, I see that sometimes you use a backwards goto in the middle to
exit, sometimes there's a single hunk at the end with forwards gotos,
and sometimes routines just return wherever they feel like it.  Please
pick one style and stick with it throughout.
