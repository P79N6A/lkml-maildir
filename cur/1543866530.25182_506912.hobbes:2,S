Subject: [PATCH] security/keys: correct handling of key->serial collisions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/9/205

The randomized key->serial choice algorithm introduced in 2.6.18  
exposed some bugs in the handling of collisions in the rbtree of  
allocated key->serials.  Collisions then resulted in eventual kernel  
oopses (due to rbtree corruption) once cleanup was attempted.  This  
patch corrects the collision handling to behave correctly.   
Additionally, the (admittedly unlikely) scenario in which there are  
no more key->serials available results in a return of -ENOMEM rather  
than an oops.

The collision resolution procedure works like the old one was  
intended to -- if you get a collision on your random serial  
selection, try the next serial (wrapping at 2^31) until you either  
(a) find a hole or (b) wrap completely around the keyspace.  Since  
the keyspace is 2^31, collisions are fairly rare -- however, with  
certain workloads, they happen with some frequency.  Samba in  
particular is a common culprit among those of us that ran across this  
bug due to its need to masquerade as many users (and therefore create  
lots of session keyrings and the like).
This patch could/should be applied to 2.6.18 and 2.6.19 as well.
