Yeah, I thought that was just too damn ugly to make it out of my
ethernet port.  Oh well, let's try it anyway.

Looks OK to me.
Here's the latest.  It includes the block_write_full_page()
chunk (minus the access-bh-after-submit_bh bug which was in
the original).
So we have three chunks:
generic_file_write(): truncate the blocks when prepare_write()
fails.  This is for ENOSPC on write-to-end-of-file.
block_write_full_page(): submit the blocks which we managed
to map.  To prevent exposure of old data.
__block_prepare_write(): zero out and dirty the blocks which
we managed to instantiate.  This is to prevent exposure of
stale data on ENOSPC during write() to mid-file.
Question: is the block_write_full_page() change correct?  We
mark the page not-up-to-date, but end_buffer_io_async() is
going to mark it uptodate anyway.
And what should we do with BH_New?
