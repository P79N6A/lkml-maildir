With a unified x86 architecture, the decision to compile with 32 or
64-bit mode isn't really different from SMP vs UP, PAE vs non-PAE and so
on.  It's just a config option with global effects.  Over time, the
number of config options with are really 32 or 64-bit specific will
probably pretty small.

The architecture is now x86, with a further 32 or 64-bit parameter.  We
already have config options for setting the sub-architecture.
