Overnight, 2.5.50-mm1 took a big stinky shit:
        EXT3-fs error (device sd(8,1)): ext3_readdir: bad entry in directory #243371: rec_len % 4 != 0 - offset=1688, inode=243681, rec_len=109, name_len=27
        Aborting journal on device sd(8,1).
        ext3_abort called.
        EXT3-fs abort (device sd(8,1)): ext3_journal_start: Detected aborted journal
        Remounting filesystem read-only
        EXT3-fs error (device sd(8,1)) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
        EXT3-fs error (device sd(8,1)): ext3_readdir: bad entry in directory #243371: rec_len % 4 != 0 - offset=1688, inode=243681, rec_len=109, name_len=27
        EXT3-fs error (device sd(8,1)) in ext3_setattr: Journal has aborted
        EXT3-fs error (device sd(8,1)) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
        EXT3-fs error (device sd(8,1)) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
Nothing particularly interesting was going on (mostly idle X desktop). 
I woke up and noticed the fs was mounted ro.  The above was in dmesg.
Rebooted and ext3 replayed the journal and said a manual check was
needed due to I/O error on the journal.  Ran fsck manually, it found a
whole bunch of orphan inodes including some scary errors like "inode
part of corrupt orphan inode list" or similar.
Rebooted again to force another fsck to be sure, and sure enough it
found more problems.  Ugh.  I started thinking bad hard drive.
Back up in X, and the same dmesg error occurred again.  Repeat above.
Now I am in 2.4 and all seems well.  So perhaps not hard drive?
IBM U2W drive on a 2940U2W if it matters.  UP kernel.
