This device shouldn't be suspended. AFAIK it should have auto_suspend
disabled
by default.
Try adding this device to drivers/usb/core/quirks.c with
USB_QUIRK_NO_AUTOSUSPEND flag set. Something like:
diff --git a/drivers/usb/core/quirks.c b/drivers/usb/core/quirks.c
index d42c561..729eb4b 100644
--- a/drivers/usb/core/quirks.c
+++ b/drivers/usb/core/quirks.c
@@ -45,6 +45,9 @@ static const struct usb_device_id usb_quirk_list[] = {
        /* SKYMEDI USB_DRIVE */
        { USB_DEVICE(0x1516, 0x8628), .driver_info = USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME
},
 
+       /* Your device */
