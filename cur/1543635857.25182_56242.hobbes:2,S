Frequently asked, but all I find is complex ways to work around the bug
rather than any patches. I do have the source routing settings in place,
virtually all packets sent to an IP not on the NIC are loggged and
droppped, so I won't have a problem with spoofing. I did turn off the
firewall on a machine to check the problem, in practice all the packets
with incorrect MAC addresses would be dropped.
I fear someone with less draconian firewalls might accept an internal IP
address on an external NIC, however. I get about 800 log entries a month
on some machines, and they're behind a boundary router.
I thought I was missing something, clearly this is a known problem.
