That's a nice catch! The problem still exists in the current -mm with
tasks marking themselves PF_NOFREEZE and then calling try_to_freeze_tasks().

Yup! That's really nasty.

In the patch 2/8, I am maintaining a global system_freeze_event_mask.
The reads and writes to this mask are serialized by freezer_mutex.
But the mutex is held only in the freeze_processes() and
thaw_processes() path.
So the check in refrigerator() which is not in the freeze_processes()/
thaw_processes() path might need some more thought. Will cook up
something.

Ok, no subtle reasons for freezer_exempt()ing after set_current_state().
So no problems changing the order. But (just curious), is there any specific
problem with this particular order ?

Thanks for the review.
