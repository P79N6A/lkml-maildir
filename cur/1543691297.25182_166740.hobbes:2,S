Are you sure the above is not a bug or a failure with the array (Justin)?

The following looks like 2.6.x output, since 2.4.x does not have REPORT
LUN support.

My guess is that something is totally screwed up with the arrays REPORT
LUN results.
Does it work OK if you turn off CONFIG_SCSI_REPORT_LUNS?
Did you check with the vendor about the problem?
You could also try modifying the arrays to report as SCSI 2, and then the
REPORT LUNS will not be sent.
If you could dump the result of sending a REPORT LUN to the device, that
would be useful. You could use the sg interface on a system (modify one of
the sg utils programs, like sg_inq.c) that found the LUNs OK, or hack the
kernel to dump the REPORT LUN output, or get a trace.
Also with CONFIG_SCSI_LOGGING enabled (hope I have this right), turn on
scsi scan logging by booting with:
	scsi_mod.scsi_logging_level=0x000001c0
	
And post the output. The extra logging probably won't help, given that the
REPORT LUN output looks corrupted.
