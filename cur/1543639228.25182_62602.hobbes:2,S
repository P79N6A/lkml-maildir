... from another run, with a printk in apic.c re: mapping the IO-APICs
turned on:
mapped IOAPIC to ffffd000 (fe800000)
mapped IOAPIC to ffffc000 (fe801000)
mapped IOAPIC to ffffb000 (fe840000)
mapped IOAPIC to ffffa000 (fe841000)
mapped IOAPIC to ffff9000 (fe880000)
mapped IOAPIC to ffff8000 (fe881000)
mapped IOAPIC to ffff7000 (fe8c0000)
mapped IOAPIC to ffff6000 (fe8c1000)
Cheers,
