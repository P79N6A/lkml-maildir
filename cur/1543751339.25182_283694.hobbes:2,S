Hello,
Have a look at /proc/sys/net/conf/XXX/arp_filter :
arp_filter - BOOLEAN
        1 - Allows you to have multiple network interfaces on the same
        subnet, and have the ARPs for each interface be answered
        based on whether or not the kernel would route a packet from
        the ARP'd IP out that interface (therefore you must use source
        based routing for this to work). In other words it allows control
        of which cards (usually 1) will respond to an arp request.
        0 - (default) The kernel can respond to arp requests with addresses
        from other interfaces. This may seem wrong but it usually makes
        sense, because it increases the chance of successful communication.
        IP addresses are owned by the complete host on Linux, not by
        particular interfaces. Only for more complex setups like load-
        balancing, does this behaviour cause problems.
Regards,
Paul
