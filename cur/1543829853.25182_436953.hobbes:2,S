Thanks

Not sure what you mean... My original intention with fcache was to use
it as a research project into what perfect block layout would do to the
boot process, since that seems to be a hot topic for some people.
Personally, the machines I do boot frequently are often bigger beasts
for testing purposes and they spend minutes getting to grub anyways. I
mostly use suspend/resume to keep my on times fast.
But it is interesting, and perhaps some parts of fcache will find its
way into distrobutions sometime (either directly, or parts of fcache
being reused for a slightly different approach).
