Oi, and a damn good thing I didn't too.
Mea culpa. I'm a dumbass. :(
The problem turned out to be this:
Box A gets its IP address and other routing information from DHCP, via the cable
modem
Box B gets its IP address and other routing information from DHCP, via the cable
modem
See where this is going?
Yup, all traffic between the two boxes was going via the cable modem and the
upstream gateway. The cable modem has an upload limit of roughly 40k/sec, so...
there it is.
Adding the appropriate routing information to each box to tell it that the other
was local resulted in an immediate jump in FTP  transfer rates to 1000k/sec,
which I think is the max speed on a 10mbs line. 
Doh!
I'll just slink off into this corner over here and be quiet for a while.
Thanks to "ManMower" who caught the problem, and to everybody else who responded.
