With respect, we have not been fine. We see problems fairly regularly
with no large page/hotplug issues with higher order allocations. 
Drivers, CIFS, kernel stacks, etc, etc etc.
The larger memory gets, the worse the problem is, just because the 
statistics make it less likely to free up multiple contiguous pages.
