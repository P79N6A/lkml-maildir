That's caught by the solution proposed.

This can't be caught at compile time.

?? I don't follow this at all. Typeof is deterministic, since the
gcc computer program is deterministic. Typeof MUST return the type of 
the expression to which it applies.  All expressions in C have 
precisely computed types -I guess  what you are saying is that that
the type of an expression may be context dependent, which I can easily
imagine in a random computer language, but seriously doubt for C.
C really does type calculations via narrowing :-o! Oh yeah!
Show me an instance of an expression that two differnt types depending
on context. I am prepared to be surprised, but dubious.
(umm ... what type is the "5" in "(short)5" ?? Why, signed integer, I
believe. It's truncated to short, modulo a language lawyer's second
opinion).

Nice integers.

signed integer value.

well, 10 is a signed integer constant. AFAIK you'd have to write "10u"
to get an unsigned integer constant. And yes, the latter would be
caught by my solution.

I see no bug.
There would be a bug if 10u were used and user_land_value were negative,
since then the result of min would be 10u (and this bug would be flagged
by my solution).  But as things are, the result is user_land_value.
I just checked.

Are you SURE you can find the bugs! :-)
