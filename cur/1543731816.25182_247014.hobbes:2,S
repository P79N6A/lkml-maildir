 The spec doesn't preclude a configuration where the master i8259A is
wired both to an I/O APIC input and to local APIC inputs.  If this is the
case, it's a sole discretion of the system manufacturer to choose which
route for the "virtual wire" is used.
 I don't insist on doing exact LVT restoration as at this stage it
shouldn't really matter and the firmware should reinitialize the APIC
subsystem completely anyway.  I just wanted to be sure you are aware of
the issue.
