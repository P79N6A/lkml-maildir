In other instances, It can actually also kill some innocent tasks unless the 
administrator tunes oom_adj, say something like kvm which would have a huge 
memory accounted, but might be from a different node altogether. Killing a 
single vm is killing all of the processes in that OS ;)  Don't you think this 
has to be fixed^Wimproved?

So you are against specifying order when it is a cpuset-constrained oom. Here 
is a revised version of the patch which adds oom.cpuset_constraint, when set 
to 1 would disable the ordering imposed by this controller for cpuset 
constrained ooms! Will this work for you?

Cgroup based OOM killer controller
Signed-off-by: Nikanth Karthikesan <knikanth@suse.de>

This is a container group based approach to override the oom killer selection 
without losing all the benefits of the current oom killer heuristics and 
oom_adj interface.
It adds a tunable oom.victim to the oom cgroup. The oom killer will kill the 
process using the usual badness value but only within the cgroup with the 
maximum value for oom.victim before killing any process from a cgroup with a 
lesser oom.victim number. Oom killing could be disabled by setting 
oom.victim=0.
Difference from oom_adj:
This controller allows users to specify "strict order" for oom kills. While 
oom_adj just works as a hint for the kernel, OOM Killer Controller gives users 
full control to decide the order in which processes should be killed. It is 
very hard to specify oom-kill order for several applications using just 
oom_adj because one needs to adjust oom_adj of various task based on oom_score 
of several tasks which keeps changing.
CPUSET constrained OOM:
Also the tunable oom.cpuset_constrained when enabled, would disable the 
ordering imposed by this controller for cpuset constrained OOMs.

+OOM Killer controller
+--- ------ ----------
+
+The OOM killer kills the process based on a set of heuristics such that only
+minimum amount of work done will be lost, a large amount of memory would be
+recovered and minimum no of processes are killed.
+
+The user can adjust the score used to select the processes to be killed using
+/proc/<pid>/oom_adj. Giving it a high score will increase the likelihood of 
+this process being killed by the oom-killer.  Valid values are in the range 
+-16 to +15, plus the special value -17, which disables oom-killing altogether
+for that process.
+
+But it is very difficult to suggest an order among tasks to be killed during
+Out Of Memory situation. The OOM Killer controller aids in doing that.
+
+USAGE
+-----
+
+Mount the oom controller by passing 'oom' when mounting cgroups. Echo
+a value in oom.victim file to change the order. The oom killer would kill
+all the processes in a cgroup with a higher oom.victim value before killing a
+process in a cgroup with lower oom.victim value. Among those tasks with same
+oom.victim value, the usual badness heuristics would be applied. The 
+/proc/<pid>/oom_adj still helps adjusting the oom killer score. Also having
+oom.victim = 0 would disable oom killing for the tasks in that cgroup.
+
+Note: If this is used without proper consideration, innocent processes may
+get killed unnecesarily.
+
+CPUSET constrained OOM:
+Setting oom.cpuset_constraint=1 would disable the ordering during a cpuset
+constrained oom. Setting oom.cpuset_constraint=0 would not distinguish
+between a cpuset constrained oom and system wide oom.
