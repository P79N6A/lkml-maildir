Hi 
I have a doubt relate to sk_buff in LINUX.
Doubt is :
When data is recived from the Ethernet adapter, it has to be give 
to IP is the sk_buff format.
The data received is already in a buffer. Now my question is,
Can i create a sk_buff with size ZERO and then attach the buffer
with the data to it ( update the length field ). 
I want to avoid data copying from one buffer to another in the receive flow, 
for better performance.
Is there any other method.
Thanks in advance
