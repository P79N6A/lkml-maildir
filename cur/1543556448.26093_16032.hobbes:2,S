Great! Hopefully we can get some winmodem support under linux when
even you have winmodem. [I actually have two of them; one sneaked in
in toshiba laptop [supported as answering machine with open-source
software], second sneaked in philips velo [not supported but complete
docs available]].
What kind winmodem do you have? Anyways, now we need someone to write
v.34 stack :-(. There's v.32bis stack opensource for Irix [see links
from linmodems.org], if 14k4 connectivity is enough porting that might
be the way to go.
