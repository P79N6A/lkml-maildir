What happens when you try to unmount filesystem?
If it doesn't let you to umount it, it's dentry leak.
If it unmounts, but writes 'Busy inode after unmount', it's inode leak.
If it unmounts and the number of inodes drops after umount, it's because
	pruning dcache works badly.
If it unmounts and the number of inodes stays the same, it's leak in
	socket inodes.
