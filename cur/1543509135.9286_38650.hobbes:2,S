     To the guy that asked about Linux on a 4/690, it works on a 4/670 which is
the same system board, just smaller chassis without all the drive bays of a
690; however, the same spin_lock bug in 2.2.x that affects SS-10 also affected
the 4/670 so it wasn't stable, but that only applies if you have multiple
CPU's.  If it's a single CPU box it will probably be fine.
     Also, 2.0.x is broken on 4/6xx platform if there is more than one CPU
module, for some reason it will hang for a long time trying to initialize the
CPU's on the 2nd module.  It seems the CPU's in the first module fine, so going
back to a 2.0.x kernel is not a workaround if you have 4 CPU's on an 4/6xx.
