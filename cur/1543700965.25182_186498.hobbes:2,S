They show up a lot in benchmarks which makes the something
to worry about.  Even if real world applications don't show
the same behavior.  Of course it is stupid to tune machines
to the benchmarks but...

For anyone taking you up on this I'd like to suggest two possible
directions.
1) Increasing PAGE_SIZE in the kernel.
2) Creating zones for the different colors.  Zones were not
   implemented last time, this was tried.
Both of those should be minimal impact to the complexity
of the current kernel. 
I don't know where we will wind up but the performance variation's
caused by cache conflicts in today's applications are real, and easily
measurable.  Giving the growing increase in performance difference
between CPUs and memory Amdahl's Law shows this will only grow
so I think this is worth looking at.
