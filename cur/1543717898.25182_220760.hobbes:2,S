1352 bytes coule be remarkably close to the TCP MSS . . .
perhaps there is some interaction with ppp where there is an overrun / lost 
packet and the TCP window is mistakenly advanced?
i.e.
  - 1500 byte MTU
  - less 28 bytes for PPP header (1472 bytes)
  - less 20 bytes for IP header (1452 bytes)
  - less 20 bytes for TCP header (1432 bytes)
if, however, the MRU is actually negotiated to be 1420 rather than 1500 . . .
when you issue the "bk pull", it may be interesting to see the output from:
         tcpdump -i ppp0 -n | grep mss
cheers,
lincoln.
