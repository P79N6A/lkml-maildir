This is actually not quite good enough. Zones are not guaranteed
to have adjacent mem_map[]'s even with CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM=n. It may
make sense to prevent merging from spanning zones, but frankly the
overhead of the pfn_to_page()/page_to_pfn() is negligible in comparison
to the data movement and (when applicable) virtual windowing, where in
the merging code cpu overhead is a greater concern, particularly for
devices that don't require manual data movement.
