Been there, done that.  Both my toybox and Firmware Linux projects do this.  
In FWL it's line 115 of this file:

It's essentially the logic of the command line "which" utility applied to 
argv[0].  If argv[0] has a relative or absolute path, then it's vs cwd (this 
has to happen when you first run the program, before you cd).  If argv[0] has 
no path then look at $PATH.
