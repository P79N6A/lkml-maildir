I agree, I think that's useful and needed.  It's possible to get the
fixes committed to an effective branch in bk and pull that back into
mainline.  So at each new release the last release hotfix branch would
stop.  But does that solve a different problem?  I don't think it'll
increase people testing intended-stable versions.
thanks,
