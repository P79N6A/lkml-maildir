Thoughts in no particular order:
 - set large page size based on file size or mapped section size
 - set LPS based on a capability on the program
 - set LPS based on a flag of some nature on the file
 - set LPS based on the number of processes mapping the file
I mention these because it would be nice to get better behaviour from
programs which aren't optimized for Linux and may never be.
