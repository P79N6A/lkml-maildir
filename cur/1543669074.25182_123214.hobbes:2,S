There's no helper daemon, nor I plan to make one. Notice that mtrr
stuff is shared between S3 (== suspend to ram) and swsusp. Both S3 and
swsusp can be used to do some pretty important stuff (machine
overheats or battery critically low -> suspend somewhere), so I do not
think userland daemon is good idea.
It can be dependend on CONFIG_PM; if you still think that's too much
bloat, it could be dependend on CONFIG_SLEEP which could be only
compiled when S3 or swsusp is selected (but I feel that would be
overdesign).
