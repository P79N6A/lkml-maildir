I'd probably just leave it alone.  Those are things that are virtually
never touched, and are quite unlikely to have any bugs in them.
But, if you do decide to change them, it might also be a nice idea to
consolidate some of the ones that are duplicated across architectures.
They could probably even go into the existing
include/asm-generic/pgtable.h.  Please use full, proper CodingStyle if
you do decide to split them across several lines.
