Well, sure, but I can't tell what the software interrupt numbers are
from here. And all of those are above FIRST_DEVICE_VECTOR AFAICT.

This is translation to software interrupt number; I don't see what the
issue is. do_IRQ() calls this on a raw vector which is the index of the
interrupt gate in the IDT, and I guaranteed that it would be the raw IDT
indexthe case elsewhere in the patch (and this is different from the
vanilla Pee Cee case, and even marked with a #ifdef).

Those aren't reachable anyway. Any given IO-APIC can only reach
devices within its own node. The only possible issue is the priority
class bounded-depth queueing issue (max of 2 or 3 pending) which I've
decided to ignore until something closer to working materializes.

What on earth? The whole patch _should_ be a no-op on vanilla Pee Cees
(modulo breakage; there is of course minimal testing going on, and doing
it in a way with a much better guarantee of not touching Pee Cee code
_at all_ is going to be needed for 2.5 mergeable stuff). The whole
1:1-ness breaking is handled by wrapping things with no-ops like the
above and then introducing the sudden semantics change, which is (as it
should be) #ifdef'd on NUMA-Q, although the #ifdef's etc. etc. probably
belong elsewhere for anything remotely mergeable.

This is the bit about the interrupt gates pushing the vector instead
of the software interrupt number, and then doing the vector -> software
interrupt number translation in do_IRQ() (which qualifies it with the
essential numa_node_id(), provided in the irq_of_vector() function).

Well, the issue is still being debugged. I'm asking for help, in my own
sick, twisted way. =)
