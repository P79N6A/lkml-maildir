I have Mesa 6.5.2 it seems (slackware-12.0 standard):
OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI G400 20061030 AGP 2x x86/MMX+/3DNow!+/SSE
OpenGL version string: 1.2 Mesa 6.5.2
The bit of the problem sketched above -- the gears just sitting there in the 
upper left corner of the screen and not moving alongside their window is 
fully reproduceable. The bit below ... :

... isn't. This seems to (again) have been a race of sorts that I hit by 
accident since I haven't reproduced yet. Had the same type of "racyness" 
trouble with keyboard behaviour in this version of X earlier.

For me, everything standard slackware-12.0 (X.org 1.3.0) and kernel 2.6.22 DRM.

I've noticed before the Matrox driver seems to get little attention/testing 
so maybe that's just it. A G550 is ofcourse in graphics-time a Model T by 
now. I'm rather decidedly not a graphics person so I don't care a lot but 
every time I try to do something fashionable (run Google Earth for example) 
I notice things are horribly, horribly broken.
X bugs I do not find very interesting (there's just too many) and the kernel 
bugs are requiring more time to reproduce than I have available. If the BUGs 
as posted aren't enough for a diagnosis, please consider the report withdrawn.
Rene.
