just a notice here: 
I had to install udev-70 to fix the "blocked udev" problem, then
noticed the  missing /dev/input/mice problem because neither gpm nor X
would start.
So I recompiled with this feature as a module ( mousedev ) and
rebooted to find udev started to create the node. ( I didn't reverse
any patches.)
Thanks.
