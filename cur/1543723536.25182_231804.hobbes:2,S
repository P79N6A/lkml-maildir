Did you execute `depmod -a` after putting your modules into the
default  directories and their information into /etc/modules.conf ?
Example:
/etc/modules.conf
alias char-major-177  module-a		# First to load
alias char-major-177  module-b		# Second to load
alias char-major-177  off		# All done
# cp module-a.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char
# cp module-b.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char
# depmod -a
The first time anybody tries to access a device with the major
number of 177, its modules will be loaded in the correct order
by modprobe.
Cheers,
