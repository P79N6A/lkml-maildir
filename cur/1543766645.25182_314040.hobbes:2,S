Device may be broken, btw, and return that value always.
How to notify about such condition?

That will require too many changes to say: 
"hey, tomorrow we will have new generic w1/i2c/superio set".
I believe it can be done, it is definitely a good idea, 
but let's fix existing bugs before changing the whole tree.

If we still have a bugs there, I do not think it is good idea 
to move things ahead.
I repeat, I agree that unufied class hierarchy for sensors devices
is a very good idea, but it can not be implemented in a couple of days,
so I would pospone it until others bugs are fixed.

Why do you think caller is in process context?
Control thread was created to process that work, which can not be done
in interrupt context, i.e. some command from unknown context
is deffered to control thread execution, which process it in a safe
context. Using connector for exaple you may send command REMOVE_*,
which will be received in BH context and just set the flag, which 
will be seen by control thread.

There are w1 devices that do not respond to search command
[actually there are devices that understand only one command at all], 
ok, they are broken, but it does not matter.

No, connector is just an example.
Classes hierarchy for all sensor devices is good idea, 
but not too easy to be implemeted.
I stronly agree with it and would like to port w1 to it.
Connector could be used to control that classes - just an example.

No need to remove bus master device, it can be there with zero refcnt,
so when it will call w1_remove_master_device() it wouldn't block.

There are devices that can not be found using w1 search commands,
there are devices that only understand one command,
I agree they are broken, but they still can be easily supported
by w1 subsystem.

Always.
With long line it is very common to lose w1 slaves - that is why it was
TTL 
attribute created - it's purpose is to integrate such events.
With device like iButton it _IS_ thy _only_ behaviour - slave object
exists only couple of seconds.

Yep.
As I said in previous e-mail - I do want to remove objects in any time, 
so it has it's own locking schema, but I also do want to use sysfs
objects, so there is another locking schema - in the place they are
touch each other there is a problem and I will fix it,
probably  by moving object freeing into ->remove() callback.
