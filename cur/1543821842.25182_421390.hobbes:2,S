That would be the case. But it is only shared between tasks where 
all the name spaces are the same.

Don't follow you here.
Basically the goal is to have a minimum number of nsproxies in the system without
having to maintain a global hash table. So instead you assume that name space
changes are infrequent. In the common case of clone without a name space change
you just share the nsproxy of the parent. If there is a name space change of
any kind you get a new one.
This won't get the absolute minimum number of nsproxies, but should be reasonably
good without too much effort.
