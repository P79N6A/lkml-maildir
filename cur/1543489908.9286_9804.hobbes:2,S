Hi there.
 > Read Changes.txt in /usr/src/linux/Documentation.
Referring to that file, where on earth are some of the updates
mentioned? Here's the relevant list from the 2.2.3 source tree...
  Kernel modules	 2.1.121           ; insmod -V
  Gnu C 		 2.7.2.3           ; gcc --version
  Binutils		 2.8.1.0.23        ; ld -v
  Linux libc5 C Library	 5.4.46            ; ls -l /lib/libc.so.*
  Linux libc6 C Library  2.0.7pre6         ; ls -l /lib/libc.so.*
  Dynamic Linker (ld.so) 1.9.9             ; ldd --version or ldd -v
  Linux C++ Library	 2.7.2.8           ; ls -l /usr/lib/libg++.so.*
  Procps		 1.2.9             ; ps --version
  Procinfo               15                ; procinfo -v
  Psmisc		 17		   ; pstree -V
  Net-tools              1.49              ; hostname -V
  Loadlin                1.6a
  Sh-utils               1.16              ; basename --v
  Autofs                 3.1.1             ; automount --version
  NFS                    2.2beta40         ; showmount --version
  Bash                   1.14.7            ; bash -version
  Ncpfs                  2.2.0             ; ncpmount -v
  Pcmcia-cs              3.0.7             ; cardmgr -V
  PPP                    2.3.5             ; pppd -v
  Util-linux             2.9g              ; chsh -v
Of these, I note the following oddities:
 1. NFS is specified as needing 2.2beta40 but the latest available
    appears to be 2.2beta37 ???
 2. Util-linux is specified as needing 2.9g or later but the latest
    appears to be 2.9 (without the g) ???
Perhaps somebody can clarify this for me as I have to admit to being
puzzled by those two, although all the other applicable ones have now
been upgraded to at least the versions specified...
Best wishes from Riley.
