As another anecdotal point, the number of oomkill/page alloc failure
related bugs that get filed against Fedora these days you can count
on one hand.  Before we switched over to 4K stacks, we were
getting regular reports from users having quite sane workloads on
capable machines getting jobs killed left and right.
Now the only cases we're seeing is usually loonies trying to
put silly amounts of RAM in 32bit systems, and the occasional
bug which turns out to be a slab leak or something similar.
(There's one oddball right now where someone sees his 5GB
 x86-64 run out of DMA zone, but that might 'go away' when
 we push out a kernel with the DMA32 zone).
