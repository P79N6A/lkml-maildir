I've been compiling my 2.1.x and later kernels with egcs snapshots (lately
gcc-2.95 snapshots) for something like a year and a half now. The problems
that surfaced where mostly fixed promptly. The current need for
-fno-strict-aliasing is bound to stay for a while, but the Makefiles for
the current 2.3.x take care of that automatically.
