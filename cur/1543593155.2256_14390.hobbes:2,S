good spotting, though, it's the inner test that's wrong, and surrounding
logic.  If the link partner is not advertising anything at all, mii_reg5
will be zero.  But, if we are forcing media type, mii_reg5 might be zero
and we don't care, so people get a misinformative message.  Not the core
problem (working on it) but a bug nonetheless.
