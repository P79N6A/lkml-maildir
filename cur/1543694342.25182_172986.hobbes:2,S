The version I am using *has* support for the 9200, but only recognizes
a PCI id of 5960, and my card has 5964. Thus I added the PCI id and
the card is eventually recognized as a 9200. Details are in the first
message I sent to the list.
Anyway, I now have to leave. I will try to dedicate some time to this
again tomorrow morning. I will try the rsync access.
