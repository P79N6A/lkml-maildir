I only know about comx drivers, developed by Gergely Madarasz
<gorgo@caesar.elte.hu>.
In fact, I've been working on my-own FR implementation for some time.
Currently it's usable with SDL N2 card (this is a "dumb" ISA HDLC board,
which can do flags/checksums/etc in hardware, at 4Mbps+ speeds).
It's possible to use ANSI or CCITT LMI now, and a port can be DTE
or DCE ( = FR network) side. I've also implemented IARP (InARP) handling
- the card would answer IARP queries from remote (but not generate requests
itself - every PVC here is a separate pvcXX network device). I plan to make
my implementation available within days, when all obvious problems are fixed.
However, I'm not sure how to do some things:
- Inverse ARP (RFC2390). This is an extension to standard ARP. It uses
  operation code 8 and 9, instead of standard 1 and 2. IARP is used for
  letting the other side know our IP (or, say, IPv6 etc) address, when the
  DLCI (hardware) address is available (from LMI messages).
  Should I move IARP handling to /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/arp.c (which seems
  natural for me), or should it stay in FR layer code?
- Should I allow a dynamic configuration of remote IP address(es) (via IARP
  queries)? Or it would be better not to send any IARP requests, and
  always configuring both our and remote IPs?
- I assume 'hard_header' routine should be used for filling (skb_push etc)
  frame headers, and 'xmit' should just send unmodified frames to the
  hardware device. Is that right?
