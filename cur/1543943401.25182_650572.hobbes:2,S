I'm fine with that, it's one of those things we'll do automatically when
we have some sort of disk profile system setup. Devices without seek
penalties should not use AS or CFQ.
Asking for a non-existing elevator is not an issue, but it may trigger
both printks and a switch to another elevator. So if you ask for
"deadline" and it's modular, you'll get cfq again if it's the default.
Your patch looks bad though, you forget to exit the old elevator. And
you don't check the return value of elevator_init().
All in all, your patch definitely needs more work before it can be
included.
