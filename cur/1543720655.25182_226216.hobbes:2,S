iBCS ceased when I decided that "enough" vendors were targetting
Linux as a Tier-1 platform and what was left was legacy proprietry
stuff that either worked or would be painful to fix. iBCS then
became linux-abi which ported to newer kernels and added UnixWare
support. I guess there just isn't enough SYSV stuff left to
keep any momentum behind linux-abi anymore either...
SCO stated a long time ago that they saw nothing in linux-abi
to worry them.
Which is kind of interesting because iBCS started life pretty
much as a way for Eric Youngdale to test his ELF loader code,
which subsequently moved into the main kernel.
(iBCS CVS is still available on 
http://sf.net/projects/ibcs
even if nothing else is. It doesn't go back quite to the
start - I think my initial import was 1993...)
