Hello All,
Really thankful for your inputs!

I stopped the program on both amd64 machine and ia64 machine and
grepped the values from /proc/<>/status and found the following.
<----Linux IPF----------->
VmSize:   126304 kB
VmLck:         0 kB
VmRSS:      6352 kB
VmData:    19696 kB
VmStk:        16 kB
VmExe:     97760 kB
VmLib:      3152 kB
<------------------------>
<------AMD64------------->
VmSize:   100432 kB
VmLck:         0 kB
VmRSS:      2828 kB
VmData:    24428 kB
VmStk:       264 kB
VmExe:     62848 kB
VmLib:      3048 kB
<----------------------->
Seems like most of core size(VmSize) on ipf (126MB) is coming from the
code size(VmExe) i.e 97MB. While the code size is just 62MB on amd64.
Looks like IA-64 wastes a lot of VM due to big instruction sizes, so
big instruction sizes will improve performance ? compared small
instruction sizes? , but fetching big instructions surely takes time
compared to small, this may be the reason why amd64 is the fasttest
64-bit process ?
Thanks a lot!
