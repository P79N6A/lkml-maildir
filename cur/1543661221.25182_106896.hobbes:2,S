Touchy matter.
Having two possible endianness options _will_ cause problems and hours
of lost work, since 50% of all users will get it wrong at least once.
And fixing bugs between keyboard and chair is not a fun job. :)
On the other hand, most filesystem data will be read more than once,
so performance does matter, at least a little.

It is not a bug, it is a tradeoff. Do you want to waste time accessing
the filesystem or fixing so-called bugs and educating the users?
