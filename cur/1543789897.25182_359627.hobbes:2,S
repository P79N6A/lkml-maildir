Subject: [BUG][2.6.13.4] Memoryleak - idr_layer_cache slab - inotify?

Hi all,
I noticed this a while back when gam_server (new fam replacement)
started playing up and the idr_layer_cache slab used up 300Mb of RAM.
To reproduce:
Run gnome and make sure it is using gam_server for fam.
In one console do:
while true ;do sleep 0.1 ; killall -w gam_server; done
In another try slabtop and see the idr_layer_cache slab climb, eating
memory (abit slowly).
( Gnome restarts gam_server after each kill for you and gets it doing
stuff )
I looked though the source and inotify does use the idr_layer_cache slab
and gam_server also uses inotify.
Thank for your time, shall I use bugzilla.kernel or is this ok? More
info needed?
Stefan
