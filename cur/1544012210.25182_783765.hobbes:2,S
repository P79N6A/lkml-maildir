Subject: [PATCH v2] tracing/ftrace: don't trace on early stage of a secondary cpu boot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Impact: fix a crash/hard-reboot while enabling cpu on runtime
On some archs, the boot of a secondary cpu can have an early fragile state.
On x86-64, the pda is not initialized on the first stage of a cpu boot but
it is needed to get the cpu number and the current task pointer. These datas
are needed during tracing. As they were dereferenced at this stage, we got a
crash while turning on a cpu on runtime while tracing.
Some other archs like ia64 can have such kind of issue too.
Changes on v2:
We drop the previous solution of a per-arch called function to guess the current state
of a cpu. That could make slow the tracing.
This patch just drop the -pg flag on arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c where
live the low level cpu boot functions, and on start_secondary() and a helper
function used at this stage.
