update: these were older numbers, here are the stats redone with the 
latest patch:
     text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    23366    4001      24   27391    6aff kernel/sched.o.vanilla
    23671    4548      24   28243    6e53 kernel/sched.o.sd.v40
    23349    2705      24   26078    65de kernel/sched.o.cfs
so CFS is now a win both for text and for data size :)
