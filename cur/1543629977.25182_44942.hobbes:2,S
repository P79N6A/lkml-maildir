But parisc has it's own implementation of pci_alloc_consistent(), so
you're ok on that platform.  And it looks like only 2 scsi drivers use
the 53c700.c code, lasi700.c and NCR_D700.c.  The NCR driver looks to
need pci, and the lasi700 driver doesn't look like it will even compile
on i386.
No wait, the NCR driver needs Microchannel, is that true?
I would like to push back and ask why you are calling a pci_* function
from a driver that does not need pci.  Yes, I know it's a nice, generic
function, but that hasn't stopped people from rewriting that same
function a number of times in different forms in different places in the
tree :)
In a perfect world, we should probably create a function like:
	void *alloc_consistent (int flags, size_t size, dma_addr_t *dma_handle);
to solve everyone's needs, but I'm not volunteering to do that :)
I'll go move the file and send the changeset to Linus.
thanks,
