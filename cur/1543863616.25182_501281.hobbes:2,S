There must be something I'm missing with that point. The faster
the turnaround of pagecache pages, the *less* efficiently the
pagecache is working (assuming a rapid turnaround means a high
rate of pages brought into, then reclaimed from pagecache).
I can't argue that a smaller pagecache will be subject to a
higher turnaround given the same workload, but I don't know why
that would be a good thing.
