hello
i am using an acer scanwit scanner which comes with the acard AEC6712D 
scsi controller.
i am also using the acard driver in 2.4.7 (also tried 2.4.13). ejecting 
the scanner seems to work (no data sent),
but scanning and previewing seems to cause problems.
it seems to be the driver that is causing the problems. when it 
eventually times out,
i get:
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 0, scsi0, channel 0, id 0, 
lun 0 Write (10) 00 82 00 00 01 00 1d e2 00
working=1 last_cmd=0  quhdu=1a quendu=1a  r 0= a r 1=2c r 2=cf r 3=2a r 
4= 0 r 5=82 r 6= 0 r 7= 0 r 8= 1 r 9= 0 r a=1d r b=e2 r c= 0 r d= 0 r e= 
0 r f= 0 r10=3a r11=20 r12= 0 r13= 0 r14= 2 r15=20 r16=80 r1c= 0 r1f=35 
in_snd= 0  r20= 1 r22= 8 r3a=2b
 r3b=20
 que cdb=  2a   0  82   0   0   1   0  1d  e2   0  last_lenu= 1de2
i have gotten some suggestions such as
removing
      if (dev->ata_cdbu[0] == READ_CAPACITY) {
        if (workrequ->request_bufflen > 8) {
                workrequ->request_bufflen = 0x08;
        }
      }
from the driver code, but this just causes the target id (as seen above to be: 0) to be the last command
so the command it got before was 0xff
as seen from
if ((j & 0x40) != 0)
		{
		     if (dev->last_cmd == 0xff)
		     {
			dev->last_cmd = target_id;
		     }
		     dev->last_cmd |= 0x40;
		}
any ideas on what the problem might be? when was the lastest bug update on atp870u.c?
thanx,
