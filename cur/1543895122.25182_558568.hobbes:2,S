It's just cleanup to get rid of things like this:
 #define PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20246	0x4d33
 #define PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20262	0x4d38
-#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20263	0x0D38
+#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20263	0x0d38
 #define PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20268	0x4d68
But still not necessary, if you think, it's useless -- but why don't have whole
document formatted in one way. However this patch needs a -fix if ACKed due to
bad regexp used (omitted '*' changes only the first uppercase letter found). If
NACKed, this doesn't matter.

Hell yes :/, every second time I post something, somebody is missing in the CC
list, grr.
