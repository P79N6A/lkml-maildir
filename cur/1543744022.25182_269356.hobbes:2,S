I seem to recall that doing so would deadlock your machine.
activate_task is called with the given cpu's runqueue locked.  printk
eventually calls release_console_sem, which will wake_up_interruptible,
which will eventually call try_to_wake_up which grabs the same lock.
I don't think I've ever seen printk work while task_rq_lock'ed.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, this is the best I was able to figure
out before giving up.
