James and Stephen agree with your LSM qualms.  I suppose we could add
cgroups next to the lsm hooks.  I suspect Paul Menage would complain
about that (Paul?), and I do think it's silly as they are security
questions, not group tracking questions, but if it's what people want
I can send out a new patch next week.

In an earlier version I asked whether you had any experience with usual
# rules per container.  Do you have an idea?  Right now the whitelist is
a straight list we search through linearly.  If # rules is generally
tiny then I'm inclined to keep it that way...
