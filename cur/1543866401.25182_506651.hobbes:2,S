Milton,
Thank you for your comments.  Carl will reply to certain parts of your 
posting where he's more knowledgeable than I.  See my replies below.

Yes, we do handle overlays.  (Note: I'm looking into a bug right now in 
our overlay support.)

Discussions on this topic in the past have resulted in the current 
implementation precisely because we're able to record the samples as 
fileoffsets, just as the userspace tools expect.   I haven't had time to 
check out how much this would impact the userspace tools, but my gut 
feel is that it would be quite significant.  If we were developing this 
module with a matching newly-created userspace tool, I would be more 
inclined to agree that this makes sense.  But you give no rationale for 
your proposal that justifies the change.  The current implementation 
works, it has no impact on normal, non-profiling behavior,  and the 
overhead during profiling is not noticeable.

Yes, there is a window here where an overlay could occur before we 
finish processing a group of samples that were actually taken from a 
different overlay.  The obvious way to prevent that is for the kernel 
(or SPUFS) to be notified of the overlay and let OProfile know that we 
need to drain (perhaps discard would be best) our sample trace buffer.  
As you indicate above, your proposal faces the same issue, but would 
just decrease the number of bogus samples.  I contend that the relative 
number of bogus samples will be quite low in either case.  Ideally, we 
should have a mechanism to eliminate them completely so as to avoid 
confusion the user's part when they're looking at a report.  Even a few 
bogus samples in the wrong place can be troubling.  Such a mechanism 
will be a good future enhancement.
