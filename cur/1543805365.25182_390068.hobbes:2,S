It's even more work for the person doing it. Maintaining the hotfixes
from 2.4.29 already takes me some time (not much more for 4 versions
than for one, what takes the most time is merging the patches, compiling
and releasing).

I can propose a deal to you. You send me a pointer to the patches that
need to be applied to 2.4.28 to make it as secure as 2.4.29, and I can
include 2.4.28 in my hotfix tree, so that you'll get regular updates
for free. I already have what is needed starting from 2.4.29, you just
have to point the 2.4.28-specific patches. It would time consuming for
me to review them all, but if someone like you has some interest in it,
it should be a win-win for both of us.
Simply send me the bkbits.net URLs, I should be able to do the rest.
Regards,
Willy
