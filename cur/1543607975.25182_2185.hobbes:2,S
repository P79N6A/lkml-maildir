For my .02, I completely disagree with you.  I'll explain in a minute.

This has to be a strength, to be honest.  I'd take this further by
proposing something else.

To be honest, I think that any x.y.z kernel is "unstable."  As we move
into a situation with an even larger installed base, I think you're
going to see a third tier become more evident: a) unstable, b) stable,
c) vendor supported.  Quite frankly, if I'm making recommendations to
customers and clients for a linux installation, I typically recommend
for them to go with a vendor supplied kernel and manage it through the
vendor.
So, while I don't appreciate "massive" VM changes in the middle of my
own testing and development :-), I always treat every new kernel
iteration as potentially "unstable" and operate on the "if it ain't
broke, don't fix it" principle on my daily use boxes (unless something
in a Linus or AC changelog looks too tempting ;-)
One can hope that the number of people reading this list plus those
keeping up with most kernel releases know what they're doing, and are a
far smaller number than those people running vendor supplied kernels and
installations.  If this isn't true today, I hope it is true at some
point in the future.
Just my opinion,
