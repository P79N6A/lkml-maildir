There's a very important difference.  PG_dirty correctness is needed,
because the _number_ of dirty pages needs to be accounted.  But there
is no such requirement for AS_CMTIME, nobody cares _how_many_ pages
have been modified since the last msync() call.  All we need to know
is _if_ the file has been modified or not.
Thanks,
