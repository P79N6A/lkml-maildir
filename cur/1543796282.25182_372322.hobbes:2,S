I can throw this in and test it for sure.  I'll run the backups every
day for a while to speed up the testing also.
Could someone please tell me exactly which patches I should include in
the kernel I will boot tomorrow?  I haven't played with -rc for ages, so
I'm no longer sure which kernel I should start with (2.6.14 or
2.6.14.3?).  Are the MPT-fusion performance fix patches in -rc4, or if
not will they still apply?
Thanks,
-ryan
