Thank you Haavard.
I have a bigger patch for all the support for STN display (tested with
mono STN display). It is based on the work from Jan Altenberg.
This bigger patch includes your modifications.
I send it right now. As a separate message.
Haavard, can you check if the compute_hozval()
function is ok on avr32 (I have reviewed with the at32ap7000 and hope 
that it is ok) ?
Regards,
