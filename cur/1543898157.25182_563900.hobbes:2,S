I can't find anything in the specification of posix_fallocate
(
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/posix_fallocate.html
)
that tells what should happen to allocate blocks on error.
But common sense would be to not leak disk space on failure of this
syscall, and this definitively should not be left up to the filesystem,
either we always leak it or always free it, and I'd strongly favour
the latter variant.

This is the xfs unwritten extent behaviour.  But anyway, the important bit
is uninitialized blocks should never ever leak to userspace, so there is
not need for the flag.
