Well, assuming that nfsd assuming the label of a remote client is
a good idea ...
    newtask = taskstructdup(current);
    newtask->security = security_of_client;
    security_act_as(newtask);
    ... do interesting things ...
    security_act_as_self(); /* security_act_as(NULL); ? */
    cleanup_newtask(...)
... would be the basic flow. For what it's worth, and the whole
issue is being debated with gusto elsewhere, there are enough
problems with nfsd using this approach that it may not be worth
holding anything up for.
