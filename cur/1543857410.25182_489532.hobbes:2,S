My understanding is that get_vm_area_node etc. can't be called in
interrupt context because vmlist_lock is obtained with read_lock /
write_lock. I am wondering if it makes sense to use read_lock_bh /
write_lock_bh so that get_vm_area_node can be called in soft interrupt
context. All the code executed when holding vmlist_lock is walking
through the list, so it shouldn't change the behavior. If it does make
sense, BUG_ON(in_interrupt()) can be changed to BUG_ON(in_irq()).
