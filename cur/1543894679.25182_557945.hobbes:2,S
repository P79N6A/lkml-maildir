One more detail: Is better put this modules listed in lsmod as "built-in"?
One doubt, in my lsmod I see sd_mod, cdrom, intel_agp, sg, pcmci_core, 
agppart, snd_page_alloc, and some others, but they didn't listed in 
.config file
E.g.
#cat config_2.6.21.1.txt | grep -i sd_mod
Result is empty!
Best regards,
Renato
