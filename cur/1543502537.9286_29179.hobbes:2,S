I recommend not going below 2 or 3%. For large filesystems I think
that 5% is indeed a bit much.
I have a filesystem with -m 1. (I think that... ) I know what I'm
doing. That filesystem fills up to whatever I need, and then gets
completely whacked again. It is NOT slowly filling up and then
hoovering around the "almost full" range, like many filesystems do.

It will be default soon. Calculate the average filesize for your
intended usage. Multiply by four for a safe margin.
The guys looking for oil will for example store at most a few thousand
300Mb files on a 300Gb partition. Add in a few ten-thousands small
files, and that'll be all. But maybe you're going to store millions of
small (< 1k) files, In that case, the 1k blocksize is not a bad idea,
and the many inodes config isn't too bad either.....
In conclusion, it pays to do the math on such VERY large filesystems.
