The previous problem is theoretically unrelated.  It arose via a separate 
mechanism which can't be used at the same as the one you're seeing now in 
the logs.
So this either looks like a problem which has gone unnoticed and was 
inadvertently fixed at some point, or is unique to the 2.6.20 stable 
series.
