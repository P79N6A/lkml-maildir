You're right in the common case - cache thrashing is definitely dominant
(though in K42 we've tried to be very careful to design code and data so
the last acquisition is almost always on the same processor).  The problem
arises is the process ever gets interrupted after spin_lock.  Then
performance falls of a cliff because everyone backs up for the lock.
That's what I had meant by in practice it works better.  From my experience
the OS likes to interrupt you in the place you least want :-).  I certainly
could point to lots of preemption numbers (which motivated the comment),
and though I'm sure there's the other, I don't know where offhand.
In some specific places it's probably all right to go with a spin lock, for
the logging/tracing code (which started this thread) that will be used
generically throughout the kernel by many callers, lockless is the way to
go.
