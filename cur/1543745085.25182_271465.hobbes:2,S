No, I think reserving a number is still necessary: there seems to be
only a very small space for dynamically registered misc devices (max
15), so that's not any better than reserving a static one.
I just don't yet see the big picture WRT device number allocation.
So what I'm interested in, is if I get a reserved minor number for the
misc (major=10) device, will I be kicked in the butt (by Linus or
anybody else) like for the /proc approach?
Thanks
