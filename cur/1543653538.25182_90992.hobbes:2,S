Since you're functionally using it, and it's not a protected use (Satire,
etc, though some would argue that the nvidia drivers are a mockery...), I
would tend to think Fair Use wouldn't apply in this case. Are there any IP
Lawyers in the house?
The only analogy i can think of is a remix of songs, and several people
have gotten into wonderfully large lawsuits over that.

This basically all falls upon the shoulders of whoever wrote the spinlock
code on whatever platform you're compiling for...
At this point, I think it's safe to say that the days of the legally
unencumbered binary-only module (read: binary-only modules you aren't
liable to get sued for) are numbered. Personally, I'm a little
saddened at the loss of openness, but won't miss weird binary-only
problems.
