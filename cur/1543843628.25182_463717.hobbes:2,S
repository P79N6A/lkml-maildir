I think you missing user-space post processing which should be also 
considered part of the problem since the capabilities of post-processing 
will be limited by the "tracepoints" available.  Tracepoints and 
post-processing are also the problems which need to be address first 
between the other established tracing projects before going forward with 
in-kernel solutions.

This seem like a good idea to dissect the problem since it seem like 
other important issues relevant to general tracing are being ignore 
simply because of a dislike of the way LTTng has chosen to implement trace.
