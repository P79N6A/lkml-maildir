On a 2.0.36 kernel the above-referenced mb
shows:
dragonwind:/proc# cat cpuinfo
processor	: 0
cpu		: ?86
model		: 386 SX/DX
vendor_id	: GenuineIntel
At the least, java breaks because of the '?' char.
Is the problem is due to the older 2.0.36 kernel,
or would the problem also present itself on a newer 2.2.x kernel?
