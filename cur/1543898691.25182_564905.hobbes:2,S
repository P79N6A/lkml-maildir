Good catch, that would have caused me some headache. So I need to add a
current->active_mm==mm check if mm_users==1.

We don't clear any of the bits in cpu_vm_mask. I though about it for a
while and got tangled in race conditions. The cpu_vm_mask optimization
works for short-lived processes which always executed on the same cpu.

We do not have to worry about speculative execution because s390 uses
special instruction to do user access (mvcs, mvcp and mvcos) and the
kernel has its own address space. The compiler doesn't know about these
instruction and cannot "accidentally" access a user space address over
the user page table when it shouldn't.

No, I don't think so. s390 is quite unique with the restriction that you
may not do a set_pte_at .. flush_tlb_xxx while a pte might get accessed
by a different cpu.

Yes, indeed the tlb flush fix and the 1K/2K page tables are my reasons
for all these patches.
