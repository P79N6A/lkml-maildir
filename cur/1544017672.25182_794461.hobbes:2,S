Do you mean to say that 'ls' could not submit another request until
the previous sync request completes, but its idle window gets disabled
as it takes way too long to complete during heavy load? But when there
are requests in the driver, wont the idling be disabled anyway? Or did
you mean to increase slice_sync?
