No, yet again the _app_ design you propose is the bottleneck.

The software designer can improve the design and architecture of the
system so that the system does not suck.  Yea, even to the point that
it rocks.
A java guy contributed to this thread a while ago, going "Well, say
you want to take advantage of 128 processors.  You'll want to have 128
threads right there".  Err, not if you want good performance and not
if your task doesn't suit that level of parallelism.  This is, to
paraphrase Alan Cox "My programming sucks, fix the language. Err...
my programming still sucks, fix the kernel"
You need to do the design by looking at nature of the task, rather
than enforcing a preconcieved C-S paradigm (threads, or <insert
buzzword here>) on it.  Look at how your task is structured.  In the
above, the six tasks you have listed are not possible in parallel.
For instance, frame output can't happen until the other tasks have all
completed.  You can't do the ray-trace for the illumination until you
know what the texture's like (bumpy, soft, clear, reflective etc)
otherwise your illumination will be wrong.  You can't map a texture
until you know what the thing you're mapping onto is structured like,
so you can't do the texture until the first three tasks are
completed. etc etc
As such, all the time you spend cloning off and synchronising those
threads is pure waste.  You might as well chuck those cycles into the
bin.  That's not the sort of performance compromise the high-perf guys 
I know would want to live with.
Secondly, the threads in your example would spend most of their lives
blocked, waiting for the other threads to finish, which would not lead
to the long runqueues you postulate.
Now, what you _could_ probably do, is divide the image up into regions
or objects and do bits of the first four tasks you mentioned in
parallel over those regions, then do the illumination in one step
(this _could_ be seperated into parallell tasks, but you'd need to be
pretty sure this was a win) when they've all completed (because
otherwise you'd have problems with the boundaries of the regions), and
output the frame.  These divisions would most likely be seperate
_processes_ rather than threads, so they can run on different
machines.  This gets rid of cache/processor affinity issues, and
ensures that your boxes all have about load avg 1 (ie optimal work).
I belive this is similar to what some "rendering farms" do.
There is _no_ benefit to just blindly forking off loads of threads,
other than to spend most of your time synchronising them, scheduling
them etc.  You'll totally trash your cache (even _if_ your task is
massively parallel), and whatever scheduler design you choose, you may
as well prompt the user for what task to schedule next for all the
difference it'll make compared to a decent app design.
Poor design leads to poor performance.  Always has, always will.
