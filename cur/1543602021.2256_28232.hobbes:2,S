As an experiment stick
	unsigned long flags;
	save_flags(flags);
	cli();
	printh("Not dead yet\n");
	/* HC ...
	..
	printk("Writel returned\n");
	readl(&ohci->regs->cmdstatus);
	printk("Write definitely occurred now\n");
	restore_flags(flags);
	printk("Ok with IRQ on\n");
Into that piece of code.
That will tell you if for example it is an IRQ storm of some kind.
