The balance in _my_ world seems just fine.  I don't let any of those
system maintenance things run while I'm using the system, and it doesn't
bother me if my working set has to be reconstructed after heavy-weight
maintenance things are allowed to run.  I'm not seeing anything I
wouldn't expect to see when running a job the size of updatedb.
