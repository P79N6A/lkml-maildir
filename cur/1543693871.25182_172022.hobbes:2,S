   Hm.
   Any real world application for which POSIX is not enough?
   Any real world application which can benefit /enourmosly/ from this?
   State, please, problem first - do not put the requirements ahead of 
problem.
   Since as of event system I would say POSIX (and Linux in particular) 
far ahead of permanently inconsistent Win32.
   [ Win32 is a very bad example, since you have there a "spawn one more 
thread" solution/workaround for any problem. Try to read MSDN by yourself. ]
P.S. <kidding> Probably Java is what you are looking for? (java.* after 
all some kind of kernel for Java, and jvm is some kind of cpu ;-))))
