Hi,
I have a project to implement some functions in TCP.
First, I wanna calculate the one-way delay by time_stamp
in TCP Acks; ie, rcv_tsval & rvc_tsecr in tcp_input.c. But 
I am not quite sure in which functions, ex. tcp_rcv_established, 
the two values (rcv_tsval & rvc_tsecr) are what I want.
Second, I want to use ECN as an indicator and add some 
conditions. But I really cannot figure out what is going on 
in tcp_input.c. Could anyone give me some hints please?
Thanks.
