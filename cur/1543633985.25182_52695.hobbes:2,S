I know they are fine (I looked over them) and I saw Linus took them, but
2.5.22 is not yet out and I did not see any reason to rush to new bits
to Alan for 2.4 when we could wait a bit and make sure 2.5 proves them
fine...
My approach thus far with 2.5 -> 2.4 O(1) backports has been one of
caution and it has worked fine thus far.  I figure, what is the rush?
