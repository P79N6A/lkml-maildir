Your pausing problem have little to do with the pausing fix, the problem
for you is the read latency, you're not triggering the race condition
fixed by the pausing fix so it can't make differences. One of the
foundamental obstacles to the read latency is the size of the I/O queue,
factor that is workarounded by the read-latency patch that basically
bypasses the size of the queue hiding the problem and in turn can't fix
the write latency with O_SYNC and the read latency during true read aio etc...
