Damn, false lines, this where numbers from 2.5.52-bk2+sysenter-patch.
But now the right and interesting lines:
2.5.53:
igor3:~# ./a.out
166.283549 cycles
278.461609 cycles
2.5.53-bk5:
igor3:~# ./a.out
150.895348 cycles
279.441955 cycles
The question is: are the numbers correct?
(I don't know if the TSC thing is actually right)
And why have int 80 also gotten faster?
Is this a valid testprogramm to find out how long a system call takes?
igor3:~# cat sysc.c 
#define rdtscl(low) \
__asm__ __volatile__ ("rdtsc" : "=a" (low) : : "edx")
int getpiddd()
{
        int i=0; return i+10;
}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        long a,b,c,d;
        int i1,i2,i3;
        rdtscl(a);
        i1 = getpiddd(); //just to see how long a simple function takes
        rdtscl(b);
        i2 = getpid();
        rdtscl(c);
        i3 = getpid();
        rdtscl(d);
        printf("function call: %lu first: %lu second: %lu cycles\n",b-a,c-b,d-c);
        return 0;
}
I link it against a slightly modified (1 line of code) dietlibc:
igor3:~# dietlibc-0.22/bin-i386/diet gcc sysc.c
igor3:~# ./a.out 
function call: 42 first: 1821 second: 169 cycles
I heard that there are serious problems involved with TSC, therefore I
don't know if the numbers are correct/make seens.
