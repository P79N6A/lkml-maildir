drivers/Kconfig doesn't source drivers/pcmcia/Kconfig (and m68k 
already uses drivers/Kconfig).
But after a second look, I begin to understand a bit more:
Most of the architectures in question even have help text for the PCMCIA 
option, but the option itself isn't asked.
IOW: It's impossible to enable them.
Is there eny reason for such options that are never visible nor enabled, 
or could they be removed?
