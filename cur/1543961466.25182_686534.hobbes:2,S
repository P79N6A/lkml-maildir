This is a false positive, and hence we should not apply this patch.
I think I understand the problem and have an idea on how to fix lockdep,
but I haven't gotten around to actually doing so.
Esp in the light that fixing lockdep isn't a requirement (just a nice to
have) for these other cpu hotplug patches we should drop these patches.
So that is, 1-4 should not be applied to mainline. I'll work on a new
and improved 2 that'll make 3 and 4 unneeded.
