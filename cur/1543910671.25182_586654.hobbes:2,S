Yeah, I get that but I was trying for future proof at build time.  However,
there is no need to have dead code on the off-chance it is eventually
used. Failing the compile should be enough so now the check looks like;
+/*
+ * SMP will align zones to a large boundary so the zone ID will fit in the
+ * least significant biuts. Otherwise, ZONES_SHIFT must be 2 or less to
+ * fit. Error if it's not
+ */
+#if (defined(CONFIG_SMP) && INTERNODE_CACHE_SHIFT < ZONES_SHIFT) || \
+	ZONES_SHIFT > 2
+#error There is not enough space to embed zone IDs in the zonelist
+#endif
