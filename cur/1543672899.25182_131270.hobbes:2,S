That's really interesting, because I got the bug since around this version
(20030417 IIRC), and it locked up only on SMP, sometimes during boot, or
during heavy disk accesses caused by "updatedb" and "make -j dep". It's
fixed in 20030502 from 
http://people.freebsd.org/~gibbs/linux/SRC/

I had the same symptom which is very frustrating, I agree. I even had
difficulties to catch the NMI watchdog output which was often truncated.

Well, would you at least agree to retest current version from the above URL ?
I find it a bit of a shame that the driver goes back in -rc stage.
Marcelo, do you have some information about the setup from the people who reported
hangs to you ? Perhaps we could even ask them to confirm that Justin's updated
driver fixes their problems ?

I certainly can understand ;-)
