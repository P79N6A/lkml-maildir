That is definitely not common sense.  It may be good business
practice, but those are two *entirely* different things.

Yes.  My personal favorite solution to this problem is HeartBeat,
some Open-Source software that is very good at maintaining high
availability.  With a properly written multi-system clustering
switch application that utilizes the Linux Virtual-Server tools,
you could reasonably efficiently run a system such that you can
reboot any individual system without any loss of service.

But you miss the point.  Linux is *NOT* about "business", or
"enterprise", or "mission-critical".  Linux is (at least to
many hackers) about hacking, having fun, and Good Design(TM).

So don't do it with ptrace!!! I've given you one other method
that uses minimal changes to existing software and emulates the
crappy mmap3 call you keep trying to push.

So why not write a utility library?  You'd need to "implement
all in the kernel", too, and since it can be done better in
userspace, let's keep out the bloat while we're at it.

So test it! You're clearly working for a big corporation with
the money and resources to develop something like this, so do
so, and if you get something that works well, *and* uses good
design, we'll welcome patches!

The kernel is not about business, demand, or what the CEO of
some big-name company wants.  The kernel strives for the goal
of "Good Engineering (TM)".
