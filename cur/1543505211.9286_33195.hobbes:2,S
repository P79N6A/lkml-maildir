Please be aware that some pages need porting the other way.
Glibc doesn't document important things, like fcntl (F_SETSIG) that
*are* documented in the man pages.  These things tend to be specific to
Linux.  And Glibc doesn't have "CONFORMING TO" sections like the man
pages.
It would be a shame to lose valuable information.
