Well, how else would you suggest to do it? Bearing in mind all other
terminal emulators (xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole, and so on) all have
other out-of-band ways to determine this - config files, menu options,
locale variables,... None of those are particularlly viable for the
kernel. I vote this is the closest thing we've got.
