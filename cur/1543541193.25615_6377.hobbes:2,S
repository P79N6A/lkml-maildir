I think this belongs in the bootloader, not in the kernel.  After all,
the whole point of initrd is to unload these kinds of dependencies
from the kernel.
I don't know what r38xx means, but if this is an x86 platform, you may
want to contact me privately and we'll see if we can work out
something suitable.
