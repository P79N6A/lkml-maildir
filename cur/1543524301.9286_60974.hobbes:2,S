Did one more test, the machine is ok as long as BOTH the cdrom and the
cardbus card isn't in the system at the same time at boot.  After I boot
with the cdrom in, cardbus card ejected physically, everything's ok.  Insert
the card, still ok.
I'm confused now and don't know where to start debugging, this is out of my
league.
