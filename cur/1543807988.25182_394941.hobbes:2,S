Yes, but now you can add a watch without any event attached. 
This would revert the original sense of the test.

See, now you can just pass IN_ONESHOT behavior flag without any
events to shoot at, which you couldn't do before. But this makes only
sense, if we would like to set a multi-shot mask to one-shot now.
Does this transition (multi shot to single shot)makes sense at all? 
Is it race-free to allow this?.
So my suggested fix instead of yours would be:
/* don't let user-space set invalid bits: we don't want flags set */
mask &= IN_ALL_EVENTS | IN_ONESHOT;
if (unlikely((mask & IN_ALL_EVENTS) == 0 && !mask_add)) {
	ret = -EINVAL;
	goto out;
}
Would you like a patch on top of the one submitted by you?
