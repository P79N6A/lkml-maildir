DVD-304 is the newer 10x SCSI model, the ATAPI equiv of the 303
is the 103S, I have that one myself.

The "global" CD speed selection is deprecated as well, DVD-ROM drives
are encouraged to implement the streaming profile where you have much
more finegrained control over read and write speeds. The 103S does
not support it, however. The "normal" CD speed select should work,
though.
