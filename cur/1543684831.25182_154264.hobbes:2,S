Well, ok, but *why*? In particular, why now, when this worked under 2.14.18-4,
with the appropriate ide-scsi module? I'd been doing backups to this drive for
months. I have lots of DVD's with tar data on them. I've done restores in the
past.
To keep a long story from getting longer, is there a way out of this mess
(short of buying another drive)?
Thanks!
