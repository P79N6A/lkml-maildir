I guess I'm seeing the same corruption as reported in this thread:
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-usb-users@lists.sourceforge.net/msg10327.html
If I copy large files to this device and then read it back, I always 
get different md5sums. And random filesystem corruption.
I've learned that the drive in this device, a Toshiba MK2004GAL is 
connected directly to the usb2.0 via a cypress CY7C68310:

Anyone have a patch I can try to address the errors?
