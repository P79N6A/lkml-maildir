Short description: when X is loaded (maybe any heavy application is 
sufficient, but I don't use anything heavy in console), 'free' says used 
memory is growing.
Keywords: memory.
Kernel: built locally, gcc 4.0.3
I have a strange problem with 2.6.19-rc-mm kernels. After I load X, I 
notice that memory is marked used at rate of tens of KB/s. Then it 
starts to swap very heavily, when physical memory is all used. I tried 
to verify it - it is so with all -mm kernels after 2.6.19-rc1-mm1, 
including 2.6.19-rc5-mm2. At the meantime everything works OK with 
kernels 2.6.18-mm3 and 2.6.19-rc1 through 2.6.19-rc6. I do not see any 
options that should be memory eating in my .config . Module list is 
short enough to include inline.
When I just run some things like periodical suck, oops proxy server etc 
with X shut down, I do not notice "leak" from console because of small 
fluctuations of memory use. When I run X and shut it down, used memory 
count goes up a few megs (consistent with speed of eating it by X).
I didn't find exactly this problem in lkml or www, though the problem 
with OOM on 2.6.19-rc-mm seems similar.
What should I check to fix problem or produce a useful bug report?
/etc/sysconfig/modules:
ehci-hcd, usb-storage, usbhid, ipaq, i915
Now loaded in 2.6.19-rc6:
i915, drm, ipaq, usbserial, usbhid, usb_storage, libusual, ehci_hcd, 
usbcore
