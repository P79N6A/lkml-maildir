The problem is that then you have to have to know whether this is a
per-cpu thing created in a module, or not, when you use it 8(
There are two things we can use to alleviate the problem.  The first
would be to put a minimal cap on the per-cpu data size (eg. 8k).  The
other possibility is to allocate on an object granularity, in which
case the rule becomes "no single per-cpu object can be larger than
XXX", but the cost is to write a mini allocator.
I agree with you (and John) about disliking the limitation, but is it
worse than the current no per-cpu stuff in modules at all?
Thanks!
Rusty.
