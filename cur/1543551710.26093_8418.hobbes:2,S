You need to generate a patch to add the code into the relevant kernel
directory and update the Makefile accordingly.  Since this is messy for
beginners, contact me (kaos@ocs.com.au) off list and I can get you
through it.
ps.  Please tell Outlook to send mail to linux-kernel using plain text
     instead of quoted printable + HTML, the latter wastes bandwidth
     and messes up patches.
