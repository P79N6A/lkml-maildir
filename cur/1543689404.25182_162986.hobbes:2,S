You need to learn about cross-compilation.
make ARCH=i386
is the first step for you. Most people doing this also have cross-compilation
tool sets (compilers, linkers, libcs etc), and the CROSS_COMPILE= make
variable can be set to pick those up.
E.g., I do
make ARCH=x86_64 CROSS_COMPILE=x86_64-unknown-linux- 
or
make ARCH=ppc CROSS_COMPILE=ppc-unknown-linux-
when building x86-64 or ppc32 kernels on an i386 host.
Your x86-64 gcc should be able to generate 32-bit binaries using
the -m32 flag, so something like make ARCH=i386 CFLAGS=-m32 might work.
