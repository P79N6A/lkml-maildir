I'm still pretty unhappy with this. It's pretty much designed to screw up 
the system by letting the driver do random things that make little or no 
sense from a VM standpoint.
The 
	BUG_ON(!(vma->vm_flags & VM_PFNMAP));
certainly helps, but it still leaves the window open for other problems. 
At the very least, it would also need a
	BUG_ON(is_cow_mapping(vma->vm_flags));
(or at least make it return VM_FAULT_SIGBUS). Because a COW mapping _will_ 
confuse the VM and cause it to do random bad things in vm_normal_page(). 
It also assumes that a negative pfn is ok as an error return, but maybe 
that's fine. I can't think of any architecture that uses all bits of the 
PFN (x86 with PAE can have a full 32-bit PFN, but I don't think any actual 
CPU supports 48 bits of physical addressing?). Something to think about.
