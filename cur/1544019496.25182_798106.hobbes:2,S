To further expand on this point, this patch also has:
@@ -588,6 +595,7 @@ static struct clk dpll4_ck = {
        .enable         = &omap3_noncore_dpll_enable,
        .disable        = &omap3_noncore_dpll_disable,
        .round_rate     = &omap2_dpll_round_rate,
+       .set_rate       = &omap3_noncore_dpll_set_rate,
        .recalc         = &omap3_dpll_recalc,
 };
We can handle this exception by replacing that set_rate function with
one which knows about this explicit quirk for this clock.  In other
words, rather than having that strcmp(), the following would be a much
better way to handle this exception:
static int omap3_dpll4_set_rate(struct clk *clk, unsigned long rate)
{
	if (omap_rev() == OMAP3430_REV_ES1_0) {
		printk(KERN_ERR "clock: DPLL4 cannot change rate due to "
		       "silicon 'Limitation 2.5' on 3430ES1.\n");
		return -EINVAL;
	}
	return omap3_noncore_dpll_set_rate(clk, rate);
}
