Yes, one maintainer.
But I'm not sure that each minor release of ther kernel needs a .Y version.

Not sure I get your point.
Again,
-ac is almost what I'm suggesting but I'd prefer to change it's name
and formalize it publishing the .Y patchset to kernel,org with a name
useful for the users.
Time to sleep now,
I'll flight to Germany tomorrow so I'll be offline till Tuesday. 
But hey, you don't need me anymore ;-)
