More strangely, the upper and lower 32-bit words are swapped.
The bytes within each 32-bit word are swapped correctly.
So the calculation maybe should be something like:
	__le32 *p = (__le32 *) &id[100 << 1];
	u32 high32 = le32_to_cpup(p);
	u32 low32 = le32_to_cpup(p + 1);
	ssize = (((u64)high32 << 32) | (u64) low32);
But that doesn't make any sense, and even ide_fix_driveid() in
drivers/ide/ide-iops.c does a le64_to_cpu() for this value:
	id->lba_capacity_2 = __le64_to_cpu(id->lba_capacity_2);
I wonder if this is some artifact of how AOE devices encode
this field when sending it to the client.
