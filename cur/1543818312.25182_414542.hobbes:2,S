As Hiroyuki-san points out we can need up to 30 bits to encode large 64
bit machines right now.  Reducing the space available for FIELDS but
reducing FLAGS_RESERVED for 64 bit machines will negativly impact them
when SPARSEMEM is enabled.  I think it makes much more sense here to use
the bits which have been released by the movement of the FIELDS upwards
in the 64 bit case.
32 bit  -------------------------------| FIELDS |       FLAGS         |
64 bit  |           FIELDS             | ??????         FLAGS         |
        63                            32                              0
Logically we should in the general case have FLAGS_RESERVED in 64 bit be
the value for 32 bit + 32; currently 9 + 32.  If we desire to have 64
bit only flags then it seems keeping FLAGS_RESERVED at 32 for 64 bit
would leave '32 bit FIELDS' segment free for those flags.
In short with the current values of FLAGS_RESERVED I would think
starting at 31 working downwards towards the 'common'/32 bit flags would
be the most logical.
Cheers.
