Subject: 2.2.19/ide.03252001 bug: "kernel timer added twice"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I just spotted these messages in my xconsole:
Apr 12 11:22:19 emma1 kernel: hda: status error: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
Apr 12 11:22:19 emma1 kernel: hda: no DRQ after issuing MULTWRITE
Apr 12 11:22:19 emma1 kernel: hda: ide_set_handler: handler not null; old=c01acc04, new=c01acc04
Apr 12 11:22:19 emma1 kernel: bug: kernel timer added twice at c01a835d.
My system.map mentions these in the vicinity of that address:
c01a8308 T ide_set_handler
c01a836c T current_capacity
The mentioned ide_set_handler:
c01acc04 T task_no_data_intr
The kernel has been compiled with gcc 2.95.2 with some other patches
which should not interfere however. (IDE 2.2.19.03252001, I²C 2.5.5,
ReiserFS 3.5.32, Serial 5.05, autofs4 from 4.0.0pre10, ext3 0.0.6b,
OpenWall OW1 patch)
I cannot tell what has happened exactly, at the time of this writing,
I'm running amanda (backup) which comprises dump and tar and this
message has not shown up again in the past 16 minutes.
This is a Western Digital Caviar AC420400D (seems to be IBM DJNA OEM)
attached to a VIA KT133 (board is a Gigabyte 7ZXR):
