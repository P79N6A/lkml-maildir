careful, you tread into dangerous territory making silly statements like that.  
by "standard" you probably mean "POSIX standard" which dash too has had 
plenty of bugs in terms of implementing it properly (and still does).  as for 
the workarounds you allude to, autotools is designed to be portable 
everywhere which means including workarounds for random bugs in major 
releases of operating systems.  just because autotools lacks workarounds for 
bugs found in random versions of dash does not make dash magical.  there is 
also the fact that autotools works on systems that predate POSIX or lack 
shells which support POSIX.  and claiming that it's safer to depend on CMake 
than bash in this Linux world is just plain bogus.
