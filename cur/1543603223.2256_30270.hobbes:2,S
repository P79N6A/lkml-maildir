What you really care about is limiting the total amount of CPU time used for
interrupt processing so that usermode progress is made. The network layer
shows this up paticularly badly because (and its kind of hard to avoid this)
it frees resources on the hardware before userspace has processed them. 
Silencing a specific target cannot be done by IRQ masking, you have to 
ask the controller to shut up. It may be the default "shut up" handler
is disable_irq but that is non optimal.
Having driver callbacks as part of the irq handler also massively improves
the effect of the event, because faced with an IRQ storm a card can
-	decide if it is the guily party
If so
-	consider switching to polled mode
-	change its ring buffer size to reduce IRQ load and up latency
	as a tradeoff
-	anything else magical the hardware has (like retuning irq
	mitigation registers)
