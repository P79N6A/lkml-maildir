Um, thats impossible, unless you're implying something like the file system 
not being 8-bit safe. The only thing UTF-8 does is store data in bytes, it 
doesn't need any real support from the file system.

I mentioned earlier that VFAT uses 8-bit encodings, none of them (supported by 
Windows, at least) are Unicode.

I agree. UDF is the true successor to the portable media throne.
