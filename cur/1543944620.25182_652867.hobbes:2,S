Subject: bad CONFIG variable references in *Makefiles*
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  unlike the previous list, here's a (much shorter) list of references
to CONFIG_ variables that occur in Makefiles that don't appear to be
defined anywhere in the tree.
  because this is a much shorter list, i don't break it down by
subdirectory, it covers the entire tree:
http://www.crashcourse.ca/wiki/index.php/Badref_make_CONFIG_variables
  for example:
...
===== MSPETH =====
./arch/mips/pmc-sierra/msp71xx/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_MSPETH) += msp_eth.o
...
  that makefile conditionally compiles based on the value of
CONFIG_MSPETH, despite the fact that CONFIG_MSPETH is not defined
anywhere.  you get the idea.  there are only a couple dozen of these.
