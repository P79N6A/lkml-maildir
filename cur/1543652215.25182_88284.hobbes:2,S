The default on my RH system with the latest errata kernel is as follows:
[root@sevilla kmaraas]# elvtune /dev/hda
/dev/hda elevator ID		0
	read_latency:		8192
	write_latency:		16384
	max_bomb_segments:	6
[root@sevilla kmaraas]# uname -a
Linux sevilla.gnome.no 2.4.18-17.7.x #1 Tue Oct 8 13:33:14 EDT 2002 i686
unknown
[root@sevilla kmaraas]#
