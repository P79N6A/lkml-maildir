I think there is value in decoupling the two operations:
	echo "0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000" > .../3c59x/table
	echo 1 > .../3c59x/probe_it
Because you want the id table additions to be persistant in the face of
cardbus unplug/replug, and for the case where cardbus card may not be
present yet, but {will,may} be soon.
