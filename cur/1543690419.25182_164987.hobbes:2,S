Hi folks,
When I upgraded my kernel version from 2.4.20-19.9(RedHat) to 2.4.22
vanilla, unmounting my smartmedia cardreader (apacer combo reader)
stopped working.
[/home/harm]$umount /mnt/usbreader
umount: /mnt/usbreader: device is busy
$fuser /mnt/usbreader shows  its not in use at all.
Mounting and writing/reading does work.
weird thing:
This only happens when the PC boots with the card reader connected.
If I actually unplug the device and plug it back in, then
mounting/unmounting does work.
Anyone an idea ?
Regards,
Harm Verhagen
