AFS has several extra bits that could be used. How about the F bit?
I'm really starting to think that the trust indicator bit should
be determined by filesystem type and/or mount option. For NFS,
the setuid bit indicates trust. For AFS, you can use the F bit.
For vfat :-) you have the system bit.
One could even have a VFS function to ask about trust.
