Final status report
The trident driver in 2.4.20 is now working on the vpr matrix 200a5 laptop with an
ALi5451 PCI soundcard. Remaining issues:
 * It consistently fails to work with the aRts server under KDE. I get "Sound server
fatal error. CPU overload: aborting" and then ""artsmessage: unix_connect: can't
connect to server." 
 * The headphone jack is dead -- this is the greatest functional loss. The
microphone jack is working; I'm unsure about the quality.
 * It's slightly erratic for some reason -- I haven't found a pattern to it. The
codec itself is very occasionally detected as AC97 Modem codec, id: ADS114, or as
AC97 Audio codec, id: ADA68.
I discovered I could use mp3blaster to increase the volume by pressing t for mixer 
and chosing PCM; this is then available in X also. I assume there's some more 
elegant way to do this -- some audio control tool? Software volume control in xmms 
works when I use the OSS driver.
Cheers,
Peter
