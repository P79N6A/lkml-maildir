Please check the write cache settings and report the results.
(There's a closed-source command line utility which can report the
status in an unambiguous way.)
If the system doesn't wait on I/O, this means that all I/O is cached
by the controller, which in turn suggests that the write cache is
turned on (with obvious consequences).
