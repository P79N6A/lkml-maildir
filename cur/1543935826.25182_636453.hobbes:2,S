Thanks.  I think I'll drop the original patch.  The mix of ints, size_t's,
etc in that code is pretty random and would be best addressed by somene
sitting down and working out from scratch what types we _should_ be using
in there and then making all the code use the right types in an organised
fashion.
Doing this in a piecemeal through-a-pinhole fashion won't work very well
and is a bit risky.
