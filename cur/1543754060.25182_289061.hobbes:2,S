I fixed that problem in the script this way...

Now it gives a consistent, readable range for the XRUN and DELAY data.
Anything over 10msec is "off the graph".  Successive graphs are easy
to compare visually.
I went back and regenerated yesterday's graphs from the original log
files with this change, so they're all consistent now for comparison
purposes.

I made more runs today with a compile of ardour running continuously
in the background.  These results were much more dramatic than
yesterday's lightly loaded system numbers.
My main conclusion is that on my system sched-fifo works almost
flawlessly, while neither nice-20 nor sched-iso hold up under load.
All the data are here...

In many runs with both nice-20 and sched-iso, some of the test clients
failed to meet their deadlines and were evicted from the JACK graph.
This was particularly evident under load (see the nice-20+compile and
sched-iso+compile logs).  But, looking back at the logs from
yesterday, I see it also happened without the background compilation.
I didn't notice, because the effects were less obvious.  But, this may
explain the rather inconsistent results I noted at the time.
This run[1] shows a particularly dramatic example of this phenomenon.
Note the DSP load dropoff around second 140.  After that everything
runs fine because almost half of the clients were ejected.

There were *no* client failures in *any* of the sched-fifo runs.
So, I reluctantly conclude that neither of the new scheduler
prototypes performs adequately in its current form.  We should get
someone else to duplicate these results on a different machine, if
possible.
I'm wondering now if the lack of priority support in the two
prototypes might explain the problems I'm seeing.
