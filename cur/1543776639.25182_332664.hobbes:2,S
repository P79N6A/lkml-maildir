Hi,
I observed the following problem with a Tevion MD 9717 card:
It works in 2.6.12-rc6-mm1, but AFAIR this was the last kernel where it 
worked, in more recent kernels (including 2.6.13-rc2-mm1) tvtime only 
says "no signal".
dmesg output with 2.6.12-rc6-mm1:
saa7134[0]: found at 0000:00:0a.0, rev: 1, irq: 6, latency: 32, mmio: 0xcfffcc00
saa7134[0]: subsystem: 1131:0000, board: Tevion MD 9717 [card=6,insmod option]
saa7134[0]: board init: gpio is 100a0
saa7134[0]: Huh, no eeprom present (err=-5)?
saa7134[0]: registered device video0 [v4l2]
saa7134[0]: registered device vbi0
saa7134[0]: registered device radio0
tuner 4-0060: chip found @ 0xc0 (saa7134[0])
tuner 4-0060: type set to 5 (Philips PAL_BG (FI1216 and compatibles))
In 2.6.13-rc2-mm1 there's an additional line
tuner 4-0060: All bytes are equal. It is not a TEA5767
I'm always saying "saa7134.card=6" at the kernel command line since I 
got a "no eeprom present" message from the driver without this.
The card is working with 2.6.12-rc6-mm1, but during running, I 
occasionally get the following message in the syslog:
saa7134[0]/audio: audio carrier scan failed, using 5.500 MHz [last detected]
