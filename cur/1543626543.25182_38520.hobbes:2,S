Yup, the earlier one you sent is sitting in my 'pending' folder, waiting
to be applied along with around 2 dozen other patches.
As you can probably guess from the 2.5.8-pre1 changelog, resyncing with
Linus is under way, so I want to try and push lots more stuff before
I start merging any extra bits. (Trying to merge to a moving target
isn't made any easier when your tree is moving also 8)
So yes, sure I'll apply it, but you may be quicker just sending it
to Linus yourself for now.  For the next week or so, this applies to
everyone else sending me patches. I'm not dropping them, but the
inbound queue is just backlogging a little.
    Dave.
