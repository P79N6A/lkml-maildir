I tend to agree with Pekka...

I don't think it really matters compared to the usefullness of grep, and
is still more readable than the old way...

Agreed.

I'd like to keep the constants as-is and have the stuff inline with no
macro trick as Pekka suggest since I did use grep on those things quite
often.

No, when I grep, i'm looking for the feature itself...
