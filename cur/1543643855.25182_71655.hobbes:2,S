what complex and slow algorithms? Take a look at the alloc_pid() and 
free_pid() fastpaths:
void free_pid(unsigned long pid)
{
        pidmap_t *map = pidmap_array + pid / BITS_PER_PAGE;
        int offset = pid & BITS_PER_PAGE_MASK;
        atomic_inc(&map->nr_free);
        test_and_clear_bit(offset, map->page));
}
it's all bitshifts.
int alloc_pid(void)
{
        pid = last_pid + 1;
        if (pid >= pid_max)
                pid = RESERVED_PIDS;
        offset = pid & BITS_PER_PAGE_MASK;
        map = pidmap_array + pid / BITS_PER_PAGE;
        if (likely(map->page && !test_and_set_bit(offset, map->page))) {
		atomic_dec(&map->nr_free);
                last_pid = pid;
                return pid;

it solves the PID-space-squeeze problem, but it does not solve the
fundamental problem: possibly thousands of consecutive PIDs allocated.
