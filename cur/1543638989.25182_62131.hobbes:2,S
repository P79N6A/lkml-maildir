Thanks, Bill.  It doesn't seem any uglier than anything else highmem-related.

Could be an inline?

Better try compiling that ;)

Four more bytes into struct page.  I bet that hurt.

We'll get fifteen pte_addr_t's per pte_chain on a P4 with the
array-of-pteps-per-pte_chain patch.
And we'll need that, to reduce load on KM_PTECHAIN.  Because
there's no point in pte_highmem without also having pte_chain_highmem,
yes?
Which means either going back to a custom allocator or teaching
slab about highmem and kmap_atomic.  (Probably a custom allocator;
internal fragmentation on 32/64/128 byte pte_chains won't be tooooo
bad, presumably).
We're piling more and more crap in there to support these pte_chains.
How much is too much?
Is it likely that large pages and/or shared pagetables would allow us to
place pagetables and pte_chains in the direct-mapped region, avoid all
this?
