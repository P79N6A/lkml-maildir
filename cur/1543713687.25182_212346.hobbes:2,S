Please, folks, don't just say it oopses.  Post a crash dump so I have
some chance of figuring out what's going wrong!
So many people have reported problems with the USB bluetooth driver that I
can't keep them straight.  Some of them crashed in usb_set_interface(),
and the patch I sent out should have fixed that.  Others crashed in
hcd_giveback_urb(), and others crashed elsewhere.  This will require more 
than a single fix.
