That is NOT true.  Without smpnice whether the "right thing" happens 
with non zero nice tasks is largely down to luck.  With smpnice the 
result is far more predictable.
The PURPOSE of smpnice IS to alter load balancing in the face of the use 
of non zero nice tasks.  The reason for doing this is so that nice 
reliably effects the allocation of CPU resources on SMP machines. I.e. 
changes in load balancing behaviour as a result of tasks having nice 
values other than zero is the desired result and NOT a side effect.
