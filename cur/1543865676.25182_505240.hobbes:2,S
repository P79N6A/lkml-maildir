yeah, i mis-analyzed the point of breakage - and my Kconfig hack simply 
papered it over by accident. I agree that your fix is the right one.

i come across this problem frequently, and sometimes it's far from 
simple and involves half a dozen Kconfigs. For example pick up a Fedora 
.config of your choice and disable CONFIG_I2C.

we should not have 'select' at all - unless it's some non-code option 
that is just a convenience switch for several other config options. A 
true dependency is already expressed in one direction via the 'depend 
on' directive - no need to express it in the other direction as well, 
that only leads to redundancy and to bugs.
