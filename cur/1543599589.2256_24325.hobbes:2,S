   That is mathematically insoluble. Think about an SMP system, you cannot stop
   the other thread in instantaneously small time
If you mean "at the time the user process trapped", pretty much this
is true.
But it _IS_ possible to capture the other threads with an SMP cross
call at the time the bad condition leading to the dump is detected.
	thread_dont_schedule(t);
	smp_reschedule();
	t->dump_core(t);
	thread_re_schedule(t);
