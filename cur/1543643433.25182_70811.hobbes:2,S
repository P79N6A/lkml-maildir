The `-' means it was removed from the patchset.  Linus merged it.
See  2.5.34/2.5.34-mm1/broken-out/sleeping-release_page.patch

You misread.  Relative times for running `make -j6 bzImage' with mem=512m:
Unloaded system:		                     1.0
2.5.34-mm4, while running 4 x `dbench 100'           1.7
