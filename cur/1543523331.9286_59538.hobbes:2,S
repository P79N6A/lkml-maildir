Precisely. So leaving all this stuff to clever driver is not enough to be
safe - for copy_*_user() set_fs() trick happens to work, but it will not
save us for anything that plays games with wiring pages down and doing
DMA... Notice that it all boils down to the right choice of 'bring me the
data' function (copy_from_user/copying from iovec/bringing the page
in-core to DMAable place and wiring it/doing nothing/etc.), but there are
two places that contribute to the choice - type of source (user vs. kernel
and plain vs. iovec) and nature of driver (copy vs. DMA). And those places
know nothing about each other...
