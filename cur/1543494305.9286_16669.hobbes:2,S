You have to upgrade some packages in order for Redhat 5.2 to work properly
with kernel 2.2.x. 
I suggest you first upgrade to RH 5.2, and then use the update RPMs for
RH5.2 at 
ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/updates/5.2/kernel2-2/i386:
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root        96607 Feb 10 18:23 dhcpcd-1.3.16-0.i386.rpm

Possibly you can also just upgrade your 5.1 with these files, but I have
not tried that. 
I can tell you that the dhcpcd is a *LOT* faster to get the IP address with
this package than with the one of RH5.2!
