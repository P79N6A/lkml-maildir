I haven't updated it since 2.1.124, but here it is
anyway. I hope you find it useful...

I just generated a 'diff' myself of your v. 3 OOM killer and it is
included below.  As for testing it, I haven't gotten any false kills
yet (i.e. on starting Netscape).  I tried the Chimera test on it (it
has a bug which causes it get in an infinite memory allocation loop on
certain pages) whith 'top' running and that looked good too.  I could
see it gradually eating up all the memory with 'kswapd' furiously
trying to set aside more memory.  After several minutes, there was no
more memory to be set aside and Chimera was OOM killed.  I haven't
tried any 'swapoff' or memory leaker tests yet, but so far, so good.
