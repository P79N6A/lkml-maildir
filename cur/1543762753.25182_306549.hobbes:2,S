Subject: [PATCH] radeonfb: Fix mode setting on CRT monitors
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi !
Current radeonfb is a bit "anal" about accepting CRT modes, it basically only
accepts modes that have the exact resolution, which tends to break with fbcon
on console switches as it provides "approximate" modes. This patch fixes it
by having the driver chose the closest possible mode instead of looking for
an exact match.
