Well,
The old novell model is simple. When someone unlinks a file, don't 
delete it, just mv it to another special directory called DELETED.SAV. 
Then setup the
fs space allocation to reuse these files when the drive fills up by 
oldest files first. It's very simple. Then you have a salvagable file 
system.
