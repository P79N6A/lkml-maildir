Good point, I'll fix it.

The next set of patches move to atomic values for the limits. That should
fix the locking.

Yes, this looks much better. I'll move to this format. I get myself lost
in "bc" at times, that should have been a hint.

I used cpuset_populate() as an example to code this one up.
I don't think there is an easy way in containers to clean up
files. I'll double check
