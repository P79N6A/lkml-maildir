you're wrong.

s/x86/pc/
and not even that.
Really this is a huge design mistake in your patch, the hard coding of conf1,
and for that reason I really don't think it should go in.
We have 4 or so methods on PC today to access config space, probably going to 6 in the next year
or two. One of those methods *HARD PICKING* another one as "second best" for cases where it
doesn't want to deal with is WRONG. It really needs to be up to the architecture/platform
to decide which ops vector is the fallback. And yes on your current PC that might well be conf1.
But hardcoding that is not the right thing. We have the vectors, we have the ranking code,
just make a "second rank" thing. 
Oh wait, my patch did that ;)
Then let either the mmconfig code or the wrapper above it (doesn't matter, in fact, I can see
value of making this decision in the wrapper and keep mmconfig code simple and clean,
because maybe mmconfig IS the thing that the architecture says needs to deal with the lower 256 bytes)..
Oh wait my patch also did that pretty much ;)
The rest of my patch was defaulting to off. Is it that bit that you really hate?
