Yes, I thought to hook generic_file_write/read for my purpose
until I found mmap does not use them! Then I went down to
writepage(s).

Yes, but it could be useful for another purpose I have
in mind.
So far, I have found sb_read that allows for blocks
reading using a buffer_head. Does all block readings
use it? What about writes?

May I conclude that all pages refer to data from/to the file?
I am not sure here, because I noticed that writepages
gets called when I unmounted the device!

Not at all. I just used a python program to create a file
with less than 1kb and then I wrote a few bytes mixing
"write" and "mmap". That's why I found strange
writepage not being called. Only writepages.

Well, so far I have only a superficial understanding of VFS,
but I feel relatively comfortable with it.
The problems I found are more related to the lower levels.
How to "say" to write the data to the storage, how to
handle the file data structures. For example, in this
case, I have to reread the original data from the file,
write it to another file, and then commit the pages
to disc as requested to the writepage(s) functions.
But to reread them, I have to save the  "about to
be written pages".
There is no literature that I know of, about this ...
and understanding the code is a hard work.
It would be nice if someone could write information about FSs.
I could find lots of information about VFS level, even a
small fs example with only 1 file. Unfortunately it works
in memory and makes no access to the disc. So,
the lower level remains obscure ...
Thank you.
Paulo
