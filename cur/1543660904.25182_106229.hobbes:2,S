I am trying to test S/W Raid5 with 2.4.21-pre3aa1 patch
After making the raidtab and doing 'mkraid' and mount xfs FS on /dev/md1,
it was keeep showing something about 'buffer size changed from 4096 --> 512' 
and back and forth and hangs.
After reset, it would not boot due to Raid failure.
After booting with 2.4.20 kernel and remove the raidtab and boot to the 
2.4.21-pre3aa1 again and repeat the same, 'mkraid' halts and ps -aux shows 
raid5d and raid5syncd is in RW and DW, respectively.
Is it known bug in 2.4.21-pre33aa1 kernel?
Thanks in advance.
