Hmmm, I never tried a cross-build before, but I don't even get this far:
  CC      arch/um/sys-i386/user-offsets.s
In file included from /usr/include/features.h:352,
                 from /usr/include/stdio.h:28,
                 from /home/jdike/linux/2.6/linux-2.6.17/arch/um/sys-i386/user-\offsets.c:1:
