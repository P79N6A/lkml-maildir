Strange - cogito over git protocol will use git itself to peek at the
references. Steve, what is your git version?

Linus' plan assumes you have a .git/config file. I don't think a
cogito-based checkout follows such modern conventions - here's an
alternative plan:
 - make sure you have a current git
 - get a fresh clone of linux-2.6, and in there
    # tell it about your old checkout
    $ git remote add oldlinux /path/to/your/older/linux/checkout/.git
    $ git fetch oldlinux
    # visualise what's in there
    $ gitk origin/master oldlinux/master
    # you may want to merge your old branch
    $ git merge oldlinux/master
hth,
