Subject: Are there kernel testing suites out there?  We need them.

One of the things Micro$oft does is stress test Windows NT after
every build.  To do this, they have a server that dishes out
scripts that kick off a huge array of tests.  The client machine
has options to specify a wide range of testing parameters.
The tests cover just about every aspect of the OS, including 
the system applications.
The areas stressed include:
	Video subsystem
	I/O
	Filesystems
	Memory
	Process management
	Network 
	DOS compatibility subsystem
	High client load (creating and killing applications 
		as fast as possible)
	SMP kernel
	Uniprocessor kernel
It would be cool if the Linux community had a similar central
test suite repository plus a kernel testing client application
that would go out and fetch tests and then crank through them.
Such a test engine client could also be used to gather 
performance data and submit it back to a central repository
along with system hardware and OS configuration information.
This would enable the development community to more rapidly 
identify bottlenecks in the kernel and the core Linux apps
and services.
