One of the problems with this sort of thing is that it has a hard time
getting the CPP macros right.  The best way to do this sort of thing is
to actually compile the header file with all the CONFIG defines and a
set of tools (read macros) that produce the required offsets.  This way
you get what you want and don't have to reinvent the CPP stuff.  It also
allows production of #define constants and other constructs that folks
push into CPP, in a very simple and straight forward manner.
Been there, done that.
