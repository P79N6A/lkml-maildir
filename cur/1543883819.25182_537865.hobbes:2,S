Yes, and if it can be made to work, it ultimately means less work for me ;)

At worst, we could set up chunk of memory as a dummy framebuffer.  That
might be useful for debugging anyway.

Xen will start the domain with a GDT loaded, and all the segment
registers loaded with flat segments.  I guess boot/compressed/head.S
could do the %cs ring check before deciding to do privileged operations.
I presume bzImage jumps straight to startup_32 on the newly decompressed
kernel?

I haven't checked if it already has this, but it would be nice if the
bzImage had a memory range/list of memory ranges it needs mapped to get
the kernel on its feet, so that the domain builder can just go and map
those areas for it (either P==V mappings, or with a constant offset;
whichever is more useful).
Also, if its a PAE kernel, Xen will start with PAE mode enabled, so
bzImage will have to deal with that.  But if its not touching
pagetables, it won't matter.

That's OK.  We'll be able to use the boot info to go into the
Xen-specific path shortly after startup_32 anyway.
BTW, the test for a non-ring 0 %cs won't always be a good test for
paravirtualization; we're likely to start seeing hybrid execution models
where we run a largely paravirtualized kernel in a SVM/VT container.  If
we can just unconditionally use the bootloader arch definition to
determine the entry path into the kernel, it will clean things up nicely.

Do we want to support starting a 64-bit guest in 64-bit mode?

Yes.  I'll need to do a moderate amount of work on the Xen side to make
this work, I think.
