I'm looking at the code for binding platform devices with drivers.  
However, platform_match() doesn't seem to agree with its kerneldoc
comment:
drivers/base/platform.c:
 50 /**
 51  *      platform_match - bind platform device to platform driver.
 52  *      @dev:   device.
 53  *      @drv:   driver.
 54  *
 55  *      Platform device IDs are assumed to be encoded like this: 
 56  *      "<name><instance>", where <name> is a short description of the 
 57  *      type of device, like "pci" or "floppy", and <instance> is the 
 58  *      enumerated instance of the device, like '' or '42'.
 59  *      Driver IDs are simply "<name>". 
 60  *      So, extract the <name> from the device, and compare it against 
 61  *      the name of the driver. Return whether they match or not.

 64 static int platform_match(struct device * dev, struct device_driver * drv)
 65 {
 66         struct platform_device *pdev = container_of(dev, struct platform_device, dev);
 67 
 68         return (strncmp(pdev->name, drv->name, BUS_ID_SIZE) == 0);
 69 }
Shouldn't that really be
 64 static int platform_match(struct device * dev, struct device_driver * drv)
 65 {
 66         struct platform_device *pdev = container_of(dev, struct platform_device, dev);
 67 
 68         return (strncmp(pdev->name, drv->name, strlen(drv->name)) == 0);
 69 }
So that, for example, the 'floppy' driver will match with any of the 
'floppy', 'floppy0' and 'floppy1' devices?
Later,
Kenn
