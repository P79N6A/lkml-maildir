Since linux's native kernel format is ELF, what's the problem with
supporting it with a boot loader?  If a loader can load ELF binaries it
also brings us in sync with some commercial UNIXes:
degas# uname -a
SunOS degas 5.5.1 Generic_103640-12 sun4c sparc SUNW,Sun_4_75
degas# file /platform/sun4c/kernel/unix
/platform/sun4c/kernel/unix:    ELF 32-bit MSB executable SPARC Version 1,
dynamically linked, not stripped
degas# 
bluebeard 13# uname -a
IRIX bluebeard 6.5 01221644 IP32
bluebeard 14# file /unix
/unix:          ELF N32 MSB mips-3 executable (not stripped) MIPS -
version 1
bluebeard 15# 
~ (2) dwild@elek> file /usr/src/linux/vmlinux 
/usr/src/linux/vmlinux: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1,
statically linked, not stripped

So my question is, as things are now vmlinux requires extra processing
before it can be loaded by a boot loader.  What's the harm in using a boot
loader that can handle the native linker format?  Does it break other
things?  (I'll be the first to admit i don't know the internals of boot
loaders, so forgive me and please correct me if i'm way off here)
