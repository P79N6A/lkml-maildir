I have changed to using /sys/devices/system for the
edac_subsystem.  I had to remove the 'static' for the
declaration of system_subsystem in drivers/base/sys.c,
and linked to it instead of the 'devices_subsys'
variable.

With the mod:
/sys/devices/system/edac
subsystem is working and I can add:
mc/mc0/csrows0/...
to it.

One reason is the naming convention used:
creating an 'edac' class followed by adding a edac
device creates the following name:
/sys/devices/system/edac/edac0/...
/sys/devices/system/edac/edac1/...
whereas I desire:
/system/devices/system/edac/mc/mc0/...
I would just register a class 'edac' and then all else
would be custom (or utilize the patch you have
mentioned)
Another reason is that EDAC is not necessarily just
for memory ECC checking only.  The EDAC module
currently has 1) ECC checking and 2) PCI parity
checking (not driver notification) on bus devices. For
the future, other EDAC types of devices can be added.
If I add an EDAC kobject 'subsystem' in the base, then
future EDAC type devices can be added and be decoupled
from the memory ECC EDAC module.
(This poses the question: if the current EDAC 
module's name is too generic just for the memory
reporter maybe it should should be edac_mem instead or
some such)
If the EDAC module "creates" the EDAC device under
/sys/devices/system, then that module will "own" that
name and future devices will need to be added to that
module. There currently is no "core" edac sysfs
subystem to provide the abstraction.
I guess the issue becomes:  Is the EDAC module JUST
for memory ECC and PCI parity reporting, in utilizing
sysfs? 
Should other future EDAC devices then also be added to
the EDAC module in order to utilize the sysfs
/sys/devices/system/edac device?
Or should they be modular in their own right and plug
into a sysfs EDAC subsystem?
I might be wrong, or need redirection, but I see this
as a clean model by using an abstraction of EDAC type
devices in sysfs.

I understand. I did look at other options, but I saw
more coupling in the others. If there were a
de-coupled EDAC sysfs 'core or base class' (ie EDAC
subsystem), then the memory ECC reporter could plug in
cleanly. The PCI Parity report could plug in. Other
future, EDAC reporters could plug in as well.

Ok, I will take a look at the patch to see its options
are. I look forward to feedback.
