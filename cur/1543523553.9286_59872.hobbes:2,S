Example lmbench numbers on a 4p box (take them with a grain of salt,
lmbench numbers fluctuate considerably between runs):

Other tests I tried were always faster with the patch.  Examples:
Kernel build (make -j 4), three runs on each kernel, first run on a clean
2.3.40 tree after a reboot, subsequent runs following make clean:

For some reason dbench shows dramatic improvements in some cases, for
example on this machine dbench 32 on 2.3.40 took at least 70 secs on all
runs I tried, with the patch it usually finished in less than 30 secs.  I'll
have to take a look at kernel traces to see what was happening.
