Heres one.. most of the time I spend cleaning up windows machines is not
because of software problems.  Usually it's the user acidentally erasing
something or installing some program that just modified the boot files by
accident.
Protection makes the system easier not harder.  You can add SUID
aplications to preform administrative tasks such as upgrading / config and
be sure that the user won't accidentally erase the system.  
I've had users absolutely paranoid of breaking something on my systems
it's very reasuring for me to be able to point at the power switch and say
"see that? don't touch it and the sustem will be fine"
