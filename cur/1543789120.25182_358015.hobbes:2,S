I am quite aware and my proposal takes it into account. I am sorry that
I failed to explain it adequately.
Did you even look at the pseudocode though?

P.S.
submit_urb()
   as->pid = current->pid;
   as->tgid = current->tgid;
.....
async_complete()
   __kill_same_process(as->pid, as->tgid);
/* DO NOT USE IN DRIVERS (other than USB core) */
__kill_same_process(pid_t pid, pid_t tgid) {
   task_struct *we, *maybe_parent;
   lock(&tasklist_lock);
   we = find_task_by_pid(pid);
   maybe_parent = find_task_by_tgid(pid);
   if (maybe_parent != NULL && we->parent == maybe_parent)
      send_sig_info(sig, info, we);
   unlock(&tasklist_lock);
