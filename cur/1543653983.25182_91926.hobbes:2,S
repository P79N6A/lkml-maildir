1. 'FS left in an unclean state' dosn't have the same ring to it
and when you spend so long in 'fsck' that you start contemplating
recovery from backup. Sorry bad choice of words.
2. Yes, was tarring up the kernel source, so reading and writing to
root filesystem (ext2).
3. it was wedged, so just powered down, on return the guilty FS was fscked
from a 2.2.22 boot.
Sorry it took so long to see your reply.
Thanks  johnf
