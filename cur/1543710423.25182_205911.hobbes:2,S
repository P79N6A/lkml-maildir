Hi All,
I installed 2.6.4 for the first time on my alpha and run into big
troubles.
After some time, new started processes are in a uninterruptible
sleep state. It seems every process that opens a file hangs.
E.g. I can't tail -f /var/log/messages
witch ~ # uptime
 09:44:29 up 14:51,  6 users,  load average: 116.99, 115.78, 110.12
Attached the output of ps -aux and /proc/slabinfo.
I don't know which further informations are needed.
cat /proc/vmstat:
nr_dirty 35
nr_writeback 0
nr_unstable 0
nr_page_table_pages 1477
nr_mapped 23651
nr_slab 2390
