Subject: Page scan keeps touching kernel text pages

While tracking down some unrelated bug I noticed that shrink_page_list()
keeps testing very low page numbers (aka kernel text) until deciding
that the page lacks a mapping and cannot get freed.  Looks like a waste
of cpu and cachelines to me.
Is there a better reason for this behaviour than lack of a patch?
