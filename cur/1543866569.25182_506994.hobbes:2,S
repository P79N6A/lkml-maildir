No problem I'll change it. I just usually align to the closest tab stop to
the opening parenthesis.

No, the serial8250_timeout is for issue 1 at the top, this is for
issue 2.

For the ports on the device they are 27 and 42. Is there any significance
that I'm not aware of?

In my editor using 4 columns per tab it lines up with everything. Is there
some convention that patches should be made assuming 8 columns?

I'm completely giving up on Thunderbird,unless someone can point out
the specific internal configuration items which needs a kick!
