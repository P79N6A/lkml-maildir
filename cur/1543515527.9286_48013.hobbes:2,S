Mike,
My attorneys have reviewed this license and they tell me that this means
that the ReiserFS is ***NOT*** open sourced.  Using it with this
restriction makes any commercial vendors who want to ship it liable for
damages claims, since the act of shipping it means they will integrate
it with an OS.  We thought of doing something similiar with NWFS, but
our attorneys, after spending several weeks examining the GPL and
reviewing case law for open source IP,  advised us is that we either
could "give it all away" or restrict it, but that if we placed any
restrictions on it, it wasn't open sourced.  If you place any use
restrictions, then you are in essence not releasing as "open" source. 
As such, we opted for the full GPL with no restrictions, since they
defeat the whole purpose under current US law.  I know lots of folks
want to maintain some control (which is not a bad thing if you are
trying to turn a profit), but they should understand that a GPL+ license
scheme defeats the whole point and makes the stuff less attractive .....
Food for thought.
