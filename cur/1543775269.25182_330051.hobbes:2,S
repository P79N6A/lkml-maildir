Yes, it could be made more symmetrical; I'll do that.
The get happened along with the malloc of the event structure, the put
happens right before the free of the same structure.  
The reason for the event was in order to get the recovery of the error
out of line from the detection of the error; detection may occur in an
interrupt context; recovery happens in a work queue.  Thus, get may
happen in that interrupt context, the put only after the work is
complete.
I'll make the code more symmetrical with regards to the event malloc/free
and that should make it more readable.
