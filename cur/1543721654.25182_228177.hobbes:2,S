internal kernel apis change and are fair game. As a RH kernel maintainer
I can guarantee you that you will suffer too from internal kernel
changes in RH/Fedora kernels. Or from changes within the 2.6.x series.
Linux needs such changes to allow faster and cleaner development.
The cost is on the external modules; it has a good side too, it provides
an incentive for external modules to merge into the kernel so that they
get fixed automatic. Having such incentives is in my opinion a good
thing.
