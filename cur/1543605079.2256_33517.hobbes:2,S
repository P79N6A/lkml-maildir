Subject: Lockups with 2.4.12?

Has anybody else been seeing random lockups with 2.4.12?  We've seen a
few servers stop responding and our backup server die nightly with
2.4.12, but 2.4.10pre10 seems to be fine.  I was only at the console once
where I could actually see Oopses, but the scrollback overflowed with
Oopses so I couldn't find the first one.  Nothing was saved to disk.  The
stack trace of the oldest Oops I could find showed a program in
sys_rt_sigaction.
I'll try to track this down a bit more, I'm just wondering if anybody
else is having similar problems.
