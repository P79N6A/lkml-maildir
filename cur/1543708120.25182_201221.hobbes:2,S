more graphs, and more graphs.

The monitoring machine, must, had until noon been up for 223 days,
running kernel 2.4.20.  I ping'd 'mhc' from must this morning, and
consistently recieved a response time of 0.2 ms.  It is using the 3c59x
module, w/ a 3c905C-TX card.
options 3c59x options=4 full_duplex=1
Just before noon, I compiled 2.4.24 on must.  Everything else is the
same, except I started running smokeping.
Now, these graphs aren't really long enough to reliably indicate a
trend.  But so far, they are showing ever increasing mhc ping reponse
times.  The same trend can be seen for other machines being monitored.
I plan to let this run this way for awhile.  Then I will boot back to
2.4.20 for comparison.
