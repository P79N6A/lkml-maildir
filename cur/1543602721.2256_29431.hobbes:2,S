Short answer is "it should"
Long answer "I have been chasing a specific problem with OSB4, seagate
drives and UDMA corruption. We can reliably reproduce it and see it on one
set of machines. Serverworks cannot reproduce it elsewhere"
So unless your box when running current -ac starts spewing messages about
DMA completions seeming broken - it should work. I only mention this
because you write:

I would thus be very interested if the current -ac "hardware just did
something impossibly stupid" trap is hit.
