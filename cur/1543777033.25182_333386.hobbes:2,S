great. I've applied these changes and have released the -28 patch. (note 
that the last chunk of your patch was malformed, have applied it by 
hand.)
i'm wondering what your thoughts are about IOAPIC_POSTFLUSH - i had to 
turn it on unconditionally again, to get rid of spurious interrupts and 
outright interrupt storms (and resulting lockups) on some systems.  
IOAPIC_POSTFLUSH is now causing much of the IO-APIC related IRQ handling 
overhead.
