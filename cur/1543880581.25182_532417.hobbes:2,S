Great.
Thanks again for doing these.

Not bad. It's always impossible to know where the sweet spot will lie with 
these things. Basically the higher the better.... for this one thing of 
course.

Well they're nice numbers indeed. I don't even need to leave the maximum at 
100ms but I seriously doubt we'd see much improvement beyond there... I'm 
sure some renderfarm might enjoy values of 1 second though (like my -ck 
patchet already offers in compute mode for old fashioned staircase cpu 
sched).

On 4x (that's what your hardware was IIRC) SD would be setting it to 15ms. 
Mainline would be timeslice granularity setting 4x to about 40ms. Pulling a 
number out of my rear end generator I'd say 20ms for SD should make it close 
enough without sacrificing latency too much more.

Heck if I'm going to keep offering SD as an alternative for comparison I may 
as well use the food you've offered me. I guess I better work on a v0.43 with 
some more of these very easy to do tweaks then. Thanks!
