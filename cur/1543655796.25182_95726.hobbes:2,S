yes.  It goes like this:
1: The new super-scalable SMP timers code had a locking problem which
   made 8-ways go oops.
2: The fix was to add a spinlock to struct timer_list.
3: spinlocks need to be initialised.
3a: struct timer_list needs to be initialised.
This is a problem, because it has traditionally been the case that
an all-zeroes struct timer_list is "initialised".  That is no longer
the case.  All timers must now be prepared with init_timer() or
TIMER_INITIALIZER()
So debugging code was added to the timer layer to detect when someone
passes an uninitialised timer into the core timer functions.  That debug
code generates a warning, a backtrace and then initialises the timer
for you, so things run happily.
I did an audit and fixed up probably a hundred or so uninitialised timers,
but there will be a few leftovers.
The intent is that people will report these leftovers, they get fixed up
and then one day we pull out the debug code.
