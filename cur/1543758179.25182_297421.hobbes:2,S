Step 1: Identify what aspect of UDP performance you find insufficient, and
under what conditions, what kernel release, and similar information.
Step 2: Re-ask your question.  "tune and optimize UDP performance" is as
impossible to answer as "how do I improve the performance of my car", without
telling us important details like what model/year car, or whether you want
better acceleration, better cornering ability, or better gas mileage.  The
best answer for myself (a middle-aged male driving a several-year-old sedan
as inconspicuously as possible) will be quite different than the answer
for the guy half my age with a sports car half my car's age (I'm *positive*
I have him beat on gas mileage however. ;)
And it's exactly the same for tuning UDP performance...
