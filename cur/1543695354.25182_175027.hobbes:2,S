Subject: modification time not set correctly after mmap updates

mtime is not being updated after changes to files via mmap, at least not
on 2.6.0-test7.   Problem shows up on both ext3 and reiserfs.
Below is an ugly little program which updates a test file without
affecting its modification time.
I tried this on 2.4.23 and got the same behavior so perhaps i'm
misinterpreting this passage from the mmap man page:
 The  st_ctime  and st_mtime field for a file mapped with PROT_WRITE
 and MAP_SHARED will be updated after a write  to  the  mapped region, 
 and before  a  subsequent msync() with the MS_SYNC or MS_ASYNC
 flag, if one occurs.
Cheers,
Sean

        mbuf[1]='x';
        msync(mbuf, SIZE, MS_SYNC);
        munmap(mbuf, SIZE);
