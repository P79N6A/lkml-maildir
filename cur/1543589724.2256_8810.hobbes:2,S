This part is correct.  
However the kernel sets CREAD by default.  
sysvinit (and possibly other inits) clears CREAD.
I wish I knew where the breakage actually occured.
And then sulogin/mingetty need to reenable it.
It's not too big of a deal except the serial code doesn't accept SAK's
when CREAD is clear.
