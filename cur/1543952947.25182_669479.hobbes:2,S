The fundamental problems
  - people sometimes chose bad summaries,
  - we can't always predict the full impact of the patch,
  - what's important for me isn't for you
cannot be solved by your proposed flags.
They can only be solved by
  - reviewing patches WRT good changelogs,
  - writing up extra summary release notes for areas of interest
    after the fact.
