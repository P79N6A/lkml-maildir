How can you tell if it's heavily loaded if you can't tell what the
current usage is?  Just wait until you hit the limit?

The current default of 128 is breaking pretty much every decent sized
postfix or apache server out there, where in the past there is no limit.
That's an awful lot of sysadmin time to track down why your server is
suddently hitting limits that didn't used to exist across every
installed Linux machine out there.
Of course the distributions can put an override in their sysctl.conf,
but in that case why not have a higher default?
Bron ( besides, the first two patches certainly aren't cruft, they're
       just different default behaviours.  The third is cruft, but I
       believe it's useful cruft in the same way file-nr is cruft )
