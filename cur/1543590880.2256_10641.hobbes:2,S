There wasn't even DHCP support before so yes you did.   As you can't
get the nfs mount point from bootp.

Unless you have a slow network, it isn't bad.  I routinely download a 3MB
kerenl+RAMDISK image in under a second.  And that ramdisk is virtually
without size optimization.  It has glibc and a whole host of user
space tools.  I have gotten it down much smaller.

Well I think in the CONFIG_BLK_DEV=n case it might wind up being a
ramfs or tmpfs image.  Something like a simplified version of tar.
