Hi,
I have just tested nbd and got touble with it.
Kernel 2.6.8.1 (from kernel.org)
nbd server and client version
When I download the latest version there are many patches under the directory
nbd but when run configure it seems not to apply any patch. No README file
to instruct anything.
So I just ./configure then make. produce nbd-client and nbd-server
The nbd kernel module is the original one from 2.6.8.1
dd if=/dev/zero of=swap bs=1M count=64
nbd-server 1024 swap
The client is a diskless ; get its root via NFS . In client I run
nbd-client 10.0.0.2 1024 /dev/nbd/0
mkswap /dev/nbd/0
swapon /dev/nbd/0
It seems fine, but when the system touch swap there are error in the kernel log
nbd0 Receive control failed result -104
and the server exited .
If I run
nbd-client 10.0.0.2 1024 /dev/nbd/0 -swap
it ask me to apply some patches to work but there is no documentation I found on net
or in the nbd tar ball tell me which patch t apply
And now if I dont use swap, I did exactly like the above and then run
mke2fs /dev/nbd/0
It immiedately gave errors like
---
nbd0: Receive control failed (result -104)
nbd0: shutting down socket
-- many other error which is because of the above one
Is there anyway to fix these? please help.
