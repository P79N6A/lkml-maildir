Ok, the test:
I chose directory /home/kelledin/gnutella.  It contains
approximately 10GB of files, ranging in size from ~5MB to
~700MB.  Most are ~600-650MB.
System specs are here:
http://www.anandtech.com/mysystemrig.html?rigid=5092
Only out-of-date info on that page is the kernel--I'm running
2.4.18+XFS-1.0.2+RML-preempt, compiled with gcc-2.95.3.  Kernel
was booted with "acpi=no-idle mem=nopentium" options.
While I was compiling jdk-1.4.0, I did the following:
[ kelledin@valhalla ~ ] # mkdir gnutella2
[ kelledin@valhalla ~ ] # cp -a gnutella gnutella2
[ kelledin@valhalla ~ ] # for FNAME in gnutella/*; do cmp
"$FNAME" "gnutella2/$FNAME"; done
The "cp -a" operation took 19 minutes, during which the system
load reached approximately 4.0 and the CPU temperature held at
54 C.  Ambient case temperature held at 26 C.  Swap usage did
not change.  System was somewhat sluggish but responsive enough
to play an mp3 and allow me to open terminal windows.  j2sdk
compile is still apparently going strong.
The comparison check...well, it finished while I was away
 getting a snack.  It printed no output, which means the check
 probably completed successfully.  Maybe I'll run some md5 sums
 later, just to be sure.
System load stayed at about 3.0, and temperatures remained
approximately the same as during the copy operation.
The relevant software:
kernel...well, you know.
glibc-2.2.5+linuxthreads+LSB+blowfish+math patches
libacl-2.0.11
libattr-2.0.8
bash-2.05a (Just for you, Hell.Surfers, just for you ;)
fileutils 4.1.8 with ACL patches and a Kelledin special. 
 Tarball can be found at:
ftp://skarpsey.dyndns.org/fileutils-4.1.8acl-kelledin.tar.bz2
Things that might be causing the corruption in our friend
J.Hart's case:
Buggy chipset (damn VIA!!!)
Faulty CPU (heat damage, chipped core?)
Faulty hard drive (hey, it's a DeathStar.)
Faulty IDE controller (if using offboard IDE)
Flaky cable (80-conductor ATA cable doesn't like being folded,
stacked, crumpled, etc., not even slightly)
Buggy IDE driver in the kernel
Buggy filesystem driver
Buggy fileutils
Buggy VM
I can't really test any of the possible software problems,
because I'm all SCSI, all XFS, bleeding-edge fileutils, and
didn't have any really significant swapping going on.  There's a
production server I could possibly test it on, but...well...it's
a production machine.  Maybe I'll repeat the test a few times
later.
