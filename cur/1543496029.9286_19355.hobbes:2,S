Subject: Reminder: BitKeeper at Linux Expo
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

We are holding a BOF for BitKeeper and we have a booth.  If you are a
kernel developer, please stop by and get a demo and come to the BOF for
an overview on how to use it.  We'll a repository with all the versions
of the kernel checked in (all 55,000+ deltas in 138MB uncompressed
repository) which you can browse - sched.c is a good one to look at.
We expect to release a version for use with the kernel in the next
few weeks (as soon as it doesn't break the minute Linus touches it :-)
Assuming that people like it, the expectation is that kernel development
will migrate towards BitKeeper.  So Linux Expo is a good time to come and
see what it is all about and make sure that your pet peeve has been fixed.
The slides for the BOF are at 
http://www.bitmover.com/talks/linuxexpo
right now.  They are an attempt to describe how to use it.  Comments
welcome.
See you at Linux Expo!
