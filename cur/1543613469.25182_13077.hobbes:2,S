Hi!
I went through a problem on an old computer, which has 2 Intel Pentium
90mhz CPU (B stepping). The computer model is an AST Manhattan P5090. I
use a 2.2.20 kernel.
First of all, the SMP module from the kernel gives me this warning :
WARNING: SMP operation may be unreliable with B stepping processors.
I think I may have found the cause of what has been my problem (and
maybe the original cause of this warning).
Linux doesn't boot at all when IRQ 2/9 is used. I tried many
different configurations, disabling a lot of cards, and it seems to be
the cause of the problem. I believe that this information could be
useful in some SMP documentation, that's why I posted it.
Thanks to all for your excellent work! I hope that this little piece of
(obsolete?) information will help.
