I don't really like this because it adds a new path that's only
used for "surprise" removals.  So we have acpi_pci_irq_disable(),
which is used for normal removals, and acpi_pci_irq_disable_nodev()
for the surprise path.  That feels like a maintenance problem.
Other, non-ACPI, IRQ routing schemes should have the same problem
(needing to know the interrupt pin after the device has been removed),
so maybe the pin needs to be cached in the pci_dev?
