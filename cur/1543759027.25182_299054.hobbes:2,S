The normal fix is to use NTP.
The clock drift problem on lost ticks is known, but I don't
think your change is the right fix.

Drivers are not supposed to block interrupts for a long time.
If they do in your environment it would be better to fix this.

It doesn't. jiffies is not used in gettimeofday(), only xtime and
wall_jiffies is. Fixing up jiffies would at best help you against a 
"uptime drift" and make the kernel internal timers a bit more accurate.
Did you really test your code? I bet it doesn't help.
In general using the TSC like this is also dangerous, because
there are system where its rate is not stable (e.g. it can vary
when the CPU changes to lower frequencies for power saving) 
BTW when you submit any patches do it in diff -u format and ready
to apply. Your form is very reviewer and user unfriendly.

This is also wrong because jiffies is really a 64bit variable.
