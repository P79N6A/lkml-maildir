No, "smart" linking of the kernel at boot time is enough to eliminate
the useless code. For example, here is what you can do:
instead of generating the spinlock code (it's an asm() anyway) you just
mark the place where it would have been used (eg by placing the address
in some .init section). Then the boottime "linker" (loader) can figure
out whether the code is necessary (based on hw detection and/or user
input) and add it. The runtime cost is just in the register allocation
(any registers that are used by the inline code will be treated in the
same way, even if the inline code isn't there). Yep, you have to make
sure that the assembler generates relocation records even for things
it thinks it knows the addresses of (which might require minor tweaks
to the build tools, esp. as this should be selective in order not to
penalize short branches).

Actually, like a distribution -- yes; like a driver vendor --
no, that is beyond the scope of this. See below though.

Ideally, there shouldn't be any difference between a "module"
and "compiled in driver", and hopefully that will be the case
in the near future.

So you are proposing to make the kernel less efficient so that
binary only driver vendors have it easier? Because once such a
"generic kernel" option is there they will use it, and then it's
no longer really optional if you happen to need just one driver
w/o source... I don't have anything against binary kernel modules,
and i think that supporting them would be a good thing, but as a
side effect of having an otherwise very useful infrastructure,
not by adding unnecessary limitations.
[the scheme described above could be used to make "generic"
 loadable modules. It's just that it becomes quite complex,
 and at that point it's probably not worth it. Hence the
 "precompiled modules" idea mentioned in the previous message.]

This can already done by providing a generic for-debugging-only
kernel. And some things can be enabled at runtime, eg you should
be able to replace the locking code with your own versions (and back).
I'm already doing this with the ip checksums, and the locking code
seems even simplier -- because of the static nature and known
out-of-line portions. Hmm, except the new spin_unlock() (which is
just memory store, hence harder to locate).
