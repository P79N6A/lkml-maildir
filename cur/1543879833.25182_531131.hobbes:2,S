One more quick comment.  The claim that there is no concept of time 
slice in the new scheduler is only true in the sense of the rather 
arcane implementation of time slices extant in the O(1) scheduler.  Your 
new parameter sched_granularity_ns is equivalent to the concept of time 
slice in most other kernels that I've peeked inside and computing 
literature in general (going back over several decades e.g. the magic 
garden).
Welcome to the mainstream,
