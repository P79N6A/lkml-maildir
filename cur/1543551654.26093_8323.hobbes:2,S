Hi all,
Just to follow up on an earlier message / thread.  I've updated to
2.2.18pre15 on the machine (dual celeron, gigabyte 6bxd) I was having
trouble writing CDRWs to, and it has made no difference,
unfortunately.
With the same tools / os on my other cdrw equipped machine
(k7/up/ricoh 9060) the very same CDRW will blank perfectly happily.
Both machines have the CDRW as the sole device on the second
ide-chain.
Using xcdrgtk's blank cd option which uses cdrecord 1.8.1 on the
failed machine gives the following log.  Using speed=1 or spped=2
makes no difference to the error reported.
