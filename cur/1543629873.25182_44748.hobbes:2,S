Are you sure about the current behaviour? Taking vsftpd as an example, it
does
prctl()
setuid()
setgid()
cap_set_proc()
i.e. it only fiddles with capabilities after dropping euid == 0. Of
course, someone is welcome to fiddle with capabilities while euid == 0.
But, euid == 0 is hugely privileged even without any capabilities. So, the
benefit of running with euid == 0 and less than full capabilities is a bit
limited.
