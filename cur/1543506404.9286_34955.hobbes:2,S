Basially, I see this as the ideal solution, a cross between a subscriber-only
list and an open list. It would require no moderators, and very little work:
If you are a subscriber to the list and you send mail to the list, your mail
is sent without any external intervention.
If you are a registered user of the list and you send mail to the list, your
mail is sent without any external intervention.
If you are not a subscriber and not a registered user of the list and you send
mail, you will receive back a message such a this one:

From: majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu

This would require a minimum amount of hacking to majordomo.
Basically just setup another file to hold email addresses that is used to
check against. since alias expansion is done on the main file, these people
will not receive copies of the mailing list but still will be able to send. I
estimate a *maximum* of 50 line change for a quick-hack, 100 if you want to
make it pretty.
