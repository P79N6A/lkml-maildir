As long as I can't unzip the latest, do a quick
	'make xconfig' w/o changing the defaults,
	 followed by
	'make bzImage',
and actually get the sucker to compile, I'd say go for it.  But there's 
still too much breakage.  And until that breakage is fixed, you won't get 
the next wave of people (users) who are curious to poke around with it.  
(some of us don't care to take half a day just to figure out what to do to make something compile because 
there's problems in the source.)
(Yes, I realize I have to customize the kernel some.  But at the very 
least the defaults shouldn't cause it to fall flat on its face.)
