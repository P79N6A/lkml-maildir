Actually, it did start a resync. Sorry, I should have mentioned that. I 
waited until the resync completed before I issued the 'mdadm --add' 
command.

I see your point. I was expecting some indication that that my array was 
vulnerable and that the new disk was not fully utilized yet. I guess the 
resync in progress indicator is sufficient.

For what it's worth, I'm using the Buslogic SCSI driver for the disks in 
the array.
