Subject: [patch 1/5] Remove entries in /sys/firmware/acpi for processor also.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/28/293

Processor entries under /sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/CPU*
were not being removed due to acpi_bus_trim not asking for it
just for processors. Without which a new hot-add after a remove doesnt call 
appropriate init functions resulting in subsequent hot-add for same
cpu failing. 
Not clear why we restricted that to non-processor devices.
