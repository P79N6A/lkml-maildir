The outgoing acks cause some packets of the upload to be dropped, or
some acks get dropped because they're fighting with the download. TCP
goes into slow start and waits for new incoming acks. The multiple 
downloads make it hards for these acks to appear, so the slow start
occurs very slowly and it appears to you that it has temporarily dropped.
