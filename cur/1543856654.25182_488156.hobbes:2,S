Just to clarify:  
Stephen is working on the Chelsio T2 HW driver.  
The drivers Divy and I are submitting are for the new Chelsio T3
hardware.  Two drivers are being submitted:  The Ethernet driver
(submitted by Divy) and the RDMA driver (submitted by me) which requires
the Ethernet driver.  The RDMA driver will live in
drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb3 and the Ethernet driver will live in
drivers/net/cxgb3.
Steve.
