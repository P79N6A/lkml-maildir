I suspect that while it's probably theoretically better it wouldn't make 
much difference on a real system (probably not enough to justify any 
extra complexity if there were any).  The exception might be on systems 
where there were lots of CPU intensive tasks that used relatively large 
chunks of CPU each time they were runnable which would give the load 
balancer a more stable load to try and balance.  It might be worth the 
extra effort to get it exactly right on those systems.  On most normal 
systems this isn't the case and the load balancer is always playing 
catch up to a constantly changing scenario.
