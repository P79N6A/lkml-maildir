Perhaps they aren't used in a form that makes any linux fs see them.
cp1252 is not the codepage used by a windows smb server so you wouldn't
need it for smbfs (same for vfat, ncpfs?), it would return data in the
corresponding dos codepage (cp850). NTFS is unicode. cd/dvd formats are 
... (?)
Maybe I'm missing something.

I think so. A tool to build them would be nice, cp1252 or not. I did some
editing before on them and the editor was perl (ok, so I suck at using awk
and sed ...).
Some format that allows different implementations to be used. All the
iso* pages could share one implementation file but let the more advanced
have different. That could of course be done with a simple "#include".
