Subject: 2.4.19: network related kernel panic (was: Blinking Keyboard LED after crash?)

Hi,
first thanks for all replies.
I have just had another identical kernel crash with kernel compiled with 
gcc-2.95.3 as it comes with SuSE 7.3
This time I got an error on console (I switched with Alt-F10 before the 
crash).
The error was an "divide error" in kfree. This was called via some functions 
from rtl8139_start_xmit (8139too.c).
Other functions involved are from
- qdisc (I use CBQ, SFQ)
- ip forward
- netfilter
- 802.1d Ethernet Bridging
The package that triggers this error is most likely coming from an DSL-modem 
over (kernel based PPPoE, pppd 2.4.1), in that case CBQ is not involved (only 
SFQ)
System:
 CPU: AMD K5PR166
 Chipset: Intel HX
My network configuration:
 eth1: RTL 8139 <-> DSL-Modem
 br0: (802.1d Ethernet Bridge)
   eth0: RTL-8029 (PCI NE2000) <-> three computers over Coax
   eth2: RTL-8139 <-> Single other computer
Kernel:
 No modules. 
 No experimental options except for PPPoE
 Memory mapped I/O for network
Has anyone experienced similar difficulties?
Has anyone a clue what it could be?
Is a hardware failure likely?
Should I post more information (complete call-trace, kernel-config, 
netfilter-rules)?
For now I have disabled CBQ and SFQ to narrow the error, but it could be weeks 
until the next crash (or perhaps it crashes before I can send this mail)
Any ideas, pointers, patches appreciated
 Jan-Hinnerk
