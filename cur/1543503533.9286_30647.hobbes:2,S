Rreal-time OS means that you can schedule tasks and they will be performed
at the time requested with a very small margin for error. That is not
Linux. There a Linux patch (largeish) called RTLiux which adds that
facility. Of course the tasks are not normal linux processes...
But the basic answer is No.
