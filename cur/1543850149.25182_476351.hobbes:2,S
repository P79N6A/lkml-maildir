It's about counters ... well, sometimes a buch of counters called
histogram.

If matters were as simple as that, sigh.
Statistics feed on data reported through events.
"Oh, this request has completed - time to update I/O counters."
The tricky question is: is event processing, that is, statistics data
aggregation, better done later (in user space), or immediately
(in the kernel). Both approaches exist: blktrace/btt vs.
gendisk statistics used by iostat, for example.
My feeling was that the in-kernel counters approach of my patch
was fine with regard to the purpose of these statistics. But blktrace
exists, undeniably, and deserves a closer look.
