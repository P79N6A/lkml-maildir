Hi Chas, good work.  A few comments below

I'm kind of confused about this.  It seems to me that you should only
need to read_lock(vcc_sklist_lock) if you are going to traverse (or
otherwise examine the structure of) the list.  There should be no need
to do it if you are just taking a reference.  After all, you should only take a
reference to a vcc (ok, to the socket) if the vcc you are going to use/copy
already has a reference taken [Example: if the ATM layer calls you and
passes you a vcc, it must have taken a reference to the vcc before calling
you, otherwise the vcc might vanish under you; then you take a reference
to this vcc -> ref count = 2].  So no-one is going to delete the vcc under
you, so why take a lock?  As I said, I'm kind of confused here.

Why does this exist at all?  I mean, if someone has already opened a vcc for
a given vpi/vci pair, the ATM layer could detect this itself and return an error,
without ever calling the driver's open method.  Is it sometimes useful to open
more than one vcc for the same vpi/vci pair?  Also, calling check_ci then
claiming the vpi/vci pair is racy.  If you want to have something like this,
shouldn't there be a routine "claim_ci", which either returns an error if that
vpi/vci pair was already in use, or marks it as in use if not (done atomically
of course).

Good stuff!
