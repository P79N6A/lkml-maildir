This user will do whatever his distro tells him to do, which is almost
certainly something *other* than what a kernel.org kernel should do.
If he's running Ubuntu, it should do whatever Ubuntu does.  If he's
on Fedora Core, it should poke the RedHat bugzilla, and so on.
If he's running a kernel.org kernel, it's probably safe to assume *some*
level of clue
