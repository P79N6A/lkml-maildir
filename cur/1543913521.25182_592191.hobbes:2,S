Anybody got a proposed scheme for the case where somebody like myself
who is *not* a member of the Maintainer Cabal has looked at a patch, and
found a valid show-stopper that's bigger than just whitespace (breaks on
64-bit, locking issues, etc), or other commentary that *should* be addressed
before it gets merged?  I'd like *some* way to tag a patch with "I had an
issue with V1, but the author addressed it to my satisfaction in V2"....
(Note that includes "the author convinced me the patch was right and I was
wrong"...)
