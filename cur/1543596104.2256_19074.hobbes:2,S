I don't have the paperwork to hand, and my memory isn't brilliant, but
the bug was something along the lines of Cyrix processors trashing the
SP if the instruction preceding (or following, I'm not sure which) a
HLT opcode was locked, and the patch was to remove some instances in
the kernel source where that occurred.
It's quite possibly unrelated, but...
Best wishes from Riley.
