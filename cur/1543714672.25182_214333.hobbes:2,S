        Ok, I just ported the 2.00.9 driver to 2.6.0.
        It still has these warnings during compilation as I did not
        attempt to apply my 64bit fixes from before as I've been told
        they are just plain wrong :/
        But, I suppose this should work fine in 32bit mode, I would
        greatly appreciate any help in porting it for 64bit platforms.
        The patch can be downloaded here :
        
http://dev.gentoo.org/~brad_mssw/kernel_patches/megaraid/megaraid-v2.00.9-linux2.6.patch
        And only applies to the source from ftp.lsil.com, it's not a
        kernel-patch
        per-se, but copying the result over to the drivers/scsi will
        compile inplace
        of the current versions.
        Please CC me on any replies!

This thread has been inactive for a while, but I've not found anything
more relevant to my situation. 
I'm running 2.6.3-gentoo (and 2.6.5-gentoo) with a LSILogic SATA
Megaraid 150-6 raid controller on a dual Opteron system. The entire
system is compiled in 64bit. We are seeing random database corruption
when access very large Postgres tables (more than 10 million rows).
Other than that, the system runs beautifully.
As far as I can tell, no amd64 specific patches have been applied to the
megaraid driver in 2.6.3 (version 2.00.3). Brad House has posted a 2.6
patch for megaraid 2.00.9, but his previous amd64 patches were removed.
LSI tech support has suggested I upgrade to 2.00.9, but the LSI source
is for 2.4.
So my questions are:
        - Could the 2.00.3 driver be responsible for random data
        corruption when running on 2.6.3 in 64bit?
        - Is it safe to run Brad House's 2.6 megaraid 2.00.9 patches in
        64 bit mode on amd64?
        - Are there any patches for megaraid 2.00.9 (or higher, I see
        2.00.10-3 has just been released) that combine patches for 2.6
        and amd64?
        
TIA,
