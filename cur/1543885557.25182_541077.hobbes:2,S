No, that's a comment. Fix your code.
(And besides, comments are supposed to be useful. Patch contained
something like...
int voltage; /* ??V */
...which is pretty unhelpful. We still stick to 80 columns in the
code, and bigger displays certainly predate utf-8 compatibility. Plus,
you'd have to convert large part of Czech republic before I could
reasonably use utf-8).
