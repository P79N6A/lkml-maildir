There's a little bit of code in show_task() which calculates
how close this task ever got to overrunning its kernel stack:
        {
                unsigned long * n = (unsigned long *) (p+1);
                while (!*n)
                        n++;
                free = (unsigned long) n - (unsigned long)(p+1);
        }
        printk("%5lu %5d %6d ", free, p->pid, p->p_pptr->pid);
SYSRQ-T will trigger this.
However it doesn't work, because do_fork() doesn't zero
out the stack pages when they're created.
