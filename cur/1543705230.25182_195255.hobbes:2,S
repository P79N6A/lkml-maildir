This _is_ what you want in your modprobe.conf file.  Or possibly
`install net-pf-10-* /bin/true', but I'm pretty sure that Rusty has
added some backward compatibility code so that either _should_ work.
The other thing that you need to do once you have updated
modprobe.conf is to run `depmod' to regenerate the dependency files.
