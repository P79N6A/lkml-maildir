This is right, the proof-of-concept exploit to be found on full-disclosure
exactly uses that memory address.

I agree with Linus. I tested the POC-exploit here on Linux 2.4.22-rc2
and Linux 2.4.23 and everything it does is to simply reboot the box. As 
for Linux 2.6.0-test9, I get something like a hangup (the same sound is
played again and again and only reset helps).
I actually am not sure whether this should be called 'local privlige
escalation' or rather 'possibility for Denial of Service attacks'.
