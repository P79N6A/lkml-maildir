That's where it is. The most recent drop is the -1115 patches.
I have some other patches converting drivers to use the new driver model,
and I will push those out soon..
However, that code does not have all the pieces to power management in it.
It simply provides a unified device tree based on locality; the framework
for doing things like system suspend.
The power management transitions live in the most recent ACPI code, which
you can get from Intel:
	
http://developer.intel.com/technology/IAPC/acpi/index.htm
and is specific to ACPI-enabled platforms.
