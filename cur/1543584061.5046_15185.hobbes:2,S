Subject: BUG? race between kswapd and ptrace (access_process_vm )

Is kswapd now running without lock_kernel()?
Then there is a race between swapout and ptrace:
access_process_vm() accesses the page table entries, only protected with
the mmap_sem semaphore and lock_kernel().
Isn't
    spin_lock(&mm->page_table_lock);
missing in access_one_page() [in linux/kernel/ptrace.c]?
