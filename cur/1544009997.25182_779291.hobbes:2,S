Make sure you do a clean compile for each build - ideally use
KBUILD_OUTPUT=/some/dir and keep the kernel tree completely clean at all
times.
It doesn't look like a configuration error.  Both configurations share
this:
CONFIG_PARAVIRT_GUEST=y
# CONFIG_XEN is not set
CONFIG_XEN_SAVE_RESTORE=y
CONFIG_VMI=y
# CONFIG_KVM_CLOCK is not set
# CONFIG_KVM_GUEST is not set
CONFIG_PARAVIRT=y
# CONFIG_PARAVIRT_CLOCK is not set
CONFIG_PARAVIRT_DEBUG=y
Which should be fine.  However, when upgrading kernels, you should always sanitize your .config - just run make menuconfig, save and exit, and it will fix any deselected options.
Could be this .config isn't valid under 2.6.27.
