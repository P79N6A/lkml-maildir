The linux kernel is all c and assembler, and probably doesn't use too much mem 
during build. Kde on the other hand is all c++ and rather huge. It will 
likely use every bit of ram you have during the build, greatly increasing the 
chances of the memory error hitting you.
But.... Recompile your kernel with the good ram, just in case...
