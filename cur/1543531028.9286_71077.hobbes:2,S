Thanks for providing these results, they're very interesting.
A couple of questions though. Firstly, the very high latency due to printk on
the PowerPC system makes me wonder whether the kernels you're using include
the fix to n_tty.c described in:
http://lists.linuxppc.org/listarcs/linuxppc-embedded/199912/msg00006.html
I'd also be interested to hear how the results change when Ingo Molnar's
lowlatency patch is applied, at:
    
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/lowlatency-patches/
And of course, it would be very interesting to see how much the results change
when running RTLinux on the PowerPC, if you have a benchmark which would run
in both environments.
Regards,
Graham
