The advantage was mainly memory savings and abilty to redefined kmallocs
to go directly to the page allocator. Totally avoids slab allocator overhead.
I thought higher order allocations were not supposed to be used in
performance critical paths? Didnt you want to do everything with order-0
allocs?
It seems that we currently need the slab allocators to compensate for the
performance problems in the page allocator for these higher order allocs.
I'd rather have the page allocator fixed but things are as they are.
