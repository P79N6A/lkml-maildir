Argh.  I meant to post THIS code:
#include <stdio.h>
#define PAGE_SHIFT 12
struct list_head {
	struct list_head *next, *prev;
};
int main(void)
{
	unsigned long order;
	unsigned long mempages = ~0;
#if PAGE_SHIFT < 13
	mempages >>= (13 - PAGE_SHIFT);
#endif
	mempages *= sizeof(struct list_head);
	printf("mempages: %lu\n", mempages);
	for (order = 0; ((1UL << order) << PAGE_SHIFT) < mempages; order++)
		;
	printf("%lu\n",order);
	return 0;
}
