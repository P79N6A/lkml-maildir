Maybe I wasn't very clear. It's only when splicing from a socket to another
socket that it breaks. Splicing from a file to a socket is OK (sendfile is
OK too BTW). Splicing from a socket to a file is OK.
And BTW, the receiving side must be on a real interface, not loopback. Here
are my observations :
  - splice data from lo to lo     => no corruption at all
  - splice data from lo to eth0   => no corruption at all
  - splice data from eth0 to lo   => occasional corruption
  - splice data from eth0 to eth0 => massive corruption
I think this may ring a bell for someone.

I figured it was an absolute necessity. The original code in my proxy is in
an experimental state and far too hard to debug for these purposes. It was
enough to detect the problem, but I could run a lot more tests with this
small test app ! An who know, maybe it will serve as an example for
non-blocking splice ;-)
Cheers,
Willy
