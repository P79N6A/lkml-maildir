Potentially, yes, usually no (hence "running from local disk" above).
This is why Manuel wants to make persistence runtime selectable.
It may well be a bit messy in the scripts to make sure all the right
drivers have persistent firmwares, and I'm sure there will be some
funny corner cases, but I don't think it's an insoluble problem.
If you have to be able to reinitialize any device from suspend without
userland running, then clearly there is no way around having all
necessary firmware images RAM resident.  But there are many situations
where that's not necessary - so why should they have to pay for the
worst case.

So?  Something could go wrong, but things can go wrong in lots of
places, I don't see what's so especially dire about this situation?

Improvements over *what*.  There is no existing method for pulling
firmware images into the kernel.
