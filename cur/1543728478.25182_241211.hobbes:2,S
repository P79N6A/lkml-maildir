I vote yes, but only to a point.  You are right; standardized interfaces
are a good thing.  For any architecture specific information, additional
fields should be available.  Perhaps either always following the
standardized sysfs entries or as an "extra-cpuinfo" (or
"[arch]-cpuinfo"?) sysfs node.

I like this idea, even if it is not necessary because siblings should be
listed sequentially together.  i.e. two physical CPUs with HT would be
cpu0, cpu1, cpu2 & cpu3.  Obviously, cpu0 & cpu1 go together and cpu2 &
cpu3 also go together.

If the flags are not going to be decoded, then I say definitely 1|0.

I like this.  In fact, if it goes this way, then I will write a
"cpuinfo" program that will do all the decoding as a generic tool.

When you are ready, I can also get SPARC64 & AMD64 (Opteron 242).
