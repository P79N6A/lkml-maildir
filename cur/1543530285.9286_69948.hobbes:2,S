I beg your pardon. This does NOT happen on my 2.0.* boxes. inetd, init
and cron (the very same) die under 2.2.*. No change except the kernel.
I should know. It's taken months to establish defenses. Those defenses
had to wait upon a diagnosis of what was killing them. The empirical
proof of the diagnosis is that the defenses work. The difference
between before and after is something like 66% uptime -> 99% uptime.
