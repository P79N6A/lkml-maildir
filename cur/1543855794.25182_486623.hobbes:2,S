The older RHEL kernels had some cases that didn't quite account exactly
but current ones ought to be right - for Centos I'd expect similar but
ask there not here as it is a very old and branched away kernel.

I would expect that, it's fragmentation. The real test is whether the
values go back properly when you kill the program.
