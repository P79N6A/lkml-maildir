Subject: [BUG] 2.6.11- sym53c8xx Broken on pp64

Seems with 2.6.11 the sym53c8xx kernel module incorrectly identifies the
cache being misconfigured on a p630 (ppc64, POWER4+). 2.6.9 correctly
brings up this adaptor as does AIX with absolutely no indication of a
misconfigured cache.
Doing a simple diff I see ALOT of changes between 2.6.9 and 2.6.11
pertaining to this module. Any ideas?
