Yes, you are right! I´m running xntpd  version xntp-4.0.92c-3. However
what astonishes me is that my second smp server, running the same kernel
but having two 450 MHz PII instead of two 500 MHz PIII installed,
doesn´t have this problem at all. To my knowledge linux-2.2.3 doesn´t
support any special PIII features. So what makes the difference - clock
rate?
