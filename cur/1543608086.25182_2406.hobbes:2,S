Well, given that it's intrusive enough to change the gendisk struct
(which my patch does as well), we may as well go whole hog and remove
all of the partition name cruft from where it should not be.  I suppose
the issue is whether you are expecting GFS to go into the kernel, or if
you want to keep the diff as small as possible if it will be outside
the kernel for a long time.
The LVM code had a global function to fix the naming issue for LVM
devices in /proc/partitions, but Linus (AFAIK) didn't like it because
it didn't fix the real problem, as the posted patch does, of localizing
the partition name generation to the driver itself.  The only wart in
the current system is that we use an external buffer passed into the
driver, and if the driver likes long names (ala LVM) it will overflow.
As I look through the kernel today, there is even more ugliness spread
around with "#ifdef CONFIG_DEVFS" to create strange partition names in
places where it should probably not be.
Cheers, Andreas
