IMHO it's not a kernel related topic. However, for example mplayer and
ogle can play DVDs. mplayer is a great piece of software (ah yeah, I'm
a developer of it :), but the DVD support is very basic but mplayer can
play very large set of common movie formats as well. Ogle is a dedicated
DVD player AFAIK, sometimes it's very hard to get work especially for
beginners, but it handles for example DVD menues as well.
