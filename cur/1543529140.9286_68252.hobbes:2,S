I think Intel wanted to provide the UDI reference implementation
for Linux.  But to be honest, today, UDI isn't very interesting from
a Linux point of view (basically, it's only about binary drivers).
Other *NIX implementors might be interested, though, because they might
be able to profit from UDI drivers which were originally written to
cover the Linux market...
