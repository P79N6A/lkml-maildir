Hi everyone,
I have built up a software virtual prototype system with ARM11MPCORE.
my system is similar with realview_eb_mpcore. but my system is
simpler, which has only a mpcore , uart0, console,timer0_1, and
memorys.
I want to run kernel 2.6.19 on it. I have done some modification, and
now I can just print out some information onto the console, and stuck
at
<7>Calibrating delay loop...
Could you guys give me some suggestion that what other adaptions
should I do according to my system?
any suggestion is welcome:)
thanks,
regards,
yang
