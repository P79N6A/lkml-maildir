The ext2 htree patch probably needs to add a "kmap()" and "kunmap()"
in the function that reads a page and scans the directory for the
name it is looking for.  I can't be any more specific than this
right now since I only have the ext3 version of this patch, and it
does not have page-cache based directories (it is still using the
buffer cache).
Cheers, Andreas
