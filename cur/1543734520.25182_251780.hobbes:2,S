The only objection here is that right now we are guaranteed that cwd and
root of every task have non-NULL ->lookup().  With your patch all we have
is S_ISDIR().
So we either need to check for non-NULL ->lookup() before the beginning of
loop in link_path_walk() or split the flag in two.  I would rather do the
former...
