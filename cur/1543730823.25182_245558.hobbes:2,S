Pretty much anything at www.namesys.com.  The amount of time which is
needed to extract the technical info which one is looking for vastly
exceeds a gnat-like attention span.
As a starting point, please prepare a bullet-point list of
userspace-visible changes which the filesystem introduces, or is planned to
introduce.
And describe the "plugin" system.  Why does the filesystem need such a
thing (other filesystems get their features via `patch -p1')?
And what are the licensing implications of plugins?  Are they derived
works?  Must they be GPL'ed?
