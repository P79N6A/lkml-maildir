Jeff, you mentioned in the status report "don't remove an operating disk 
from an ICH5, hotplug is not supported".
Does this mean hardware damage, or just serious libata/ICH5 confusion? 
I've got a six-disk server here with two disks on an ICH5 and four on an 
SATA150 TX4, and I really would like to be able to hot-replace a disk in 
case of a failure. If the ICH5 cannort support this, I'm going to have 
to get a 3ware card.
