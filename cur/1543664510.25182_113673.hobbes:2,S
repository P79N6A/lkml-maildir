And the actual important information is missing in this mail (I'm a bit
fast in hitting the send button today :)).  The proper replacement for
kdevname on blockdevices would be partitions_name - but in this specific
case we can't use it because it's the piece of code that constructs the
name that is stored for use by partition_name if we don't have any
better information.
