This is the fourth release of the -tiny kernel tree. The aim of this
tree is to collect patches that reduce kernel disk and memory
footprint as well as tools for working on small systems. Target users
are things like embedded systems, small or legacy desktop folks, and
handhelds.
Latest release includes:
 - various compile fixes for last release
 - actually include Andi Kleen's bloat-o-meter this time
 - optional mempool removal
 - optional semaphore uninlining
 - optional linux socket filter
 - reduced flow cache
 - optional device multicast management
 - optional rtnetlink/af_netlink
 - optional IGMP
 - optional POSIX timer API
 - inline cleanup in fs/namei.c
