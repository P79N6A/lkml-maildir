I can't think of a reasonable tool-based approach to this, but I can
definitely see that a program could use this well.  It simply requires
that you use the filp to store your state.
fd = open(/dev/crypto) -> creates filp
write(fd, "Death to all fanatics!\n"); -> calls crypto device, stores result in
	private data structure
sleep(100);
read(fd, "Qrngu gb nyy snangvpf!\n"); -> frees data structure
[You'll note the advanced design of my crypto processor.]
Clearly, this is open to abuse by persons never calling read() and passing in
far too much to write().  I think this can be alleviated by refusing to accept more than (say) 4k at a time, or bean-counter.
A sick way would be to allow the ->write() call to have its buffer
modified.  But I don't think we want to go down that path.
