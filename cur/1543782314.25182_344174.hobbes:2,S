Sorry, but my intent with this drivers is to make them as free as
possible. I have ported the old driver because the only non-free files
are the .Os . The new drivers distributed by linuxant have more
restrictive licences. I would love to see the binary modules replace
by, for example, the free modulator/demodulator implemented by Fabrice
Bellard (1), but this is a much longer project.
