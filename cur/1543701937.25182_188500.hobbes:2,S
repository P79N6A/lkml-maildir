I have asked because on one machine (with heavy load) i have problems
with 2.4.23 and 2.4.24-pre* - crashes without any information (no oops) 
in logs file or console (connected via RS). Only blank screen. Sync or 
umount via SysRq  doesn't work, only (re)boot. System is RH 9, ext3
2x2.66GHz (with HT), aic79xx, 4GB RAM +4GB swap.
