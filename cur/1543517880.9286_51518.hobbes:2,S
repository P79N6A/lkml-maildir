Subject: Anyone talking to AC97 codecs?

IF I understand the AC97 specs and my hardware correctly, I need to use
my hardware's implementation of AC-Link to send PCM audio to/from the
codec.
The Via audio chip's AC-Link is implemented using scatter-gatter DMA. 
All the pieces are present except for:
exactly what data is written to the scatter-gather DMA buffers?
The AC97 docs talk about input and output slots, so I presume that an
audio frame needs a special AC97 header of some sort...
Thanks for any enlightenment.  All the AC97 code I've seen in ALSA and
the kernel is mixer-related code, which is not what I'm looking for.
Regards,
	Jeff
