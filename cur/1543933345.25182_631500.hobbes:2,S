Could someone here help settle this argument?
I have written a driver (for the CD Rom on the Sega Dreamcast). I have
marked various initialisation functions - including probe() and the
functions that it, and only it, calls, as __init.
Other developers tell me I should mark them as __devinit.
However I think this is wrong as:
* The CD on the Dreamcast is not and will never be a hotpluggable device
* The Dreamcast is a limited memory device and if marking various
functions as __init helps save memory that is A Good Thing
It has been put to me that while the use case (not hotpluggable) is
correct, it is still better practice to use __devinit
I have built the code with both __init and __devinit and both work, so
there is no issue of practicality as such here.
