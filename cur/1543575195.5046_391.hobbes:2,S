 If you want to handle triple faults (well, there should be none of these
given a proper double fault handler) you may use the NMI as well.  You are
guaranteed to receive a NMI after a while when the watchdog is active (it
is for SMP systems by default now and it will be for P6+ UP systems for
Linux 2.5 as well).  At least current Intel chipsets do not assert RESET
to the CPU as a response to the shutdown special cycle in their default
configuration (we may even explicitly force that behaviour).
