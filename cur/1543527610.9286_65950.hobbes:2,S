    Why not?   If I want a hostile environment where I have to use
    userland tools to get even the tiniest bit of information out, I'll
    use one of the *BSDs, Solaris, or Windows.

    libc isn't part of the kernel, and it's naive to assume that any of

    the kernel published interface is pushed out into a pieces of
    userland code that's controlled by a third party.
