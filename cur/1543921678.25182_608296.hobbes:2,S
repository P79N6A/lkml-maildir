There's another issue: the "irqsave/irqrestore" versions are much safer 
than the plain "irq" versions, in case the caller already has interrupts 
disabled. 
So anybody making the change not only would need to make the performance 
argument, he'd better not be a janitor that blindly does the change 
without thinking about all call-sites etc..
