Why would the task be stuck there if it's not becasue of a freezer ? The
only reason I see would be a dependency on something like kmalloc trying
to push things to disk, or a lock owned by another user process, but the
former is a generic issue I've discussed in a separate mail and the
later is a driver bug imho.
