I've seen this kind of problems on my notebook too. Among others, over 
600MB of a huge cache directory (from a news reader) was having "funny" 
permissions. Maybe more files were affected. I used fsck.ext3 and 
changed the attributes with chmod.
It may be caused by crashes of the notebook (power failure and 
suspend/resume failure), but I would expect that the administration of 
the fs would survive that, as it did for years. Actually, the last time 
I had filesystem corruption was in kernel 1.2.xx days...
As my notebook is not using raid, I suspect something in the ext3 code. 
Kernel is 2.6.1 with ACPI, acpi-dsdt and swsusp2 patches.
Regards,
Bas.
