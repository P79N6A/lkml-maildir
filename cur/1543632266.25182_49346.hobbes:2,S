Hello
There was a few typos in the patch I sent to the list previously. A 
remaining '&'  from a cut'n paste and INTEL_I815_APCONT instead of 
INTEL_815_APCONT
The full correct patch for Intel815 (against 2.4.19-pre8-ac5, but easily 
adaptable to 2.4.19-pre9-ac2) is available at 
http://ltswww.epfl.ch/~aspert/patches/patch-intel_815-2.4.19-pre8-ac5
The rest *should* be OK, please test.
I wish I had a dedicated computer on which I could compile all this 
stuff... Maybe one day ;-)
Best regards
