Let me repeat: there is no such code. In user space dev_t already is
64 bits, whether you like it or not. We cannot go back to libc5.
In kernel space we all want to use pointers to a device struct,
and major and minor are fields in that struct. There is no advantage
in making those fields narrow. And what is carried around is the
pointer, a 32-bit object.
In other words, inside the kernel the normal obvious coding will
give us ints major, minor. Outside the kernel we have a 64-bit dev_t.
And there is only the interface of system calls that uses this
narrow 16-bit straw. Of course, making it 32-bit is an improvement
but I can really not see any reason to make things difficult for
ourselves by widening this straw to 32-bits only.
Changing kernel and filesystems and glibc is a bit of a hassle -
not very difficult, but we started six years ago and still have
not finished - so it is better to do things right at once.

It was an example showing the advantage of having a 64-bit object.
Code gets simpler and faster.
But while dev_t already is 64-bits in user space, the same does not
hold for pid_t. I think that I once sent you a patch that would make
the pid use 2^31 instead of 2^15 values. Changing the size of pid_t
is not really possible, it would require a new version of the glibc
library.
	In short, both your arguments are totally bogus. Your "simpler" function
	is in fact a horrible rats nest and a source of subtle bugs that you
	apparently never even thought about.
	And that's without ever actually mentioning the word "bloat" and "data
	cache usage".
Not so pessimistic. Think and reconsider.
