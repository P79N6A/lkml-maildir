It is okay... we are pretty careful, and most of those features are in
userspace code. As long as code does not damage the image in progress
(and I believe we have checksum there), more features should not
really hurt.
Besides, that is what this flamefest is about. Nigel wants all those
features in kernel, claims it can not be done incrementally, and due
to the design, he's probably right. uswsusp can do most/all of them in
userspace.
