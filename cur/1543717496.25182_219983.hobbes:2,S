I figured as much, and I intend to use some of the other wlan drivers as a 
framework and to get a better idea of how to interface it, as for the io 
addresses/timing/etc, I was thinking that if you can use (i could be 
misremembering the name of the project) ... use the ndis wrappers and use 
an xp driver, it should be possible to just make the wrapper very verbose, 
id think anyways- although id have to look through the wrappers source and 
get a feel for how it works before i could really make that statement.
This is somewhat off topic to the discussion, but really its not- does the 
dmca restrict me from doing such a thing?

i was pretty sure thats how it worked, but my level of programming in this 
specific arena is fairley minimal. Anyways, thanks for the tips/advice.
