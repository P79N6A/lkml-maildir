No. People who use select() and read() in the *other* documented
manner, however ill-advised, would see the expected, and at least from
the perspective of myself and a few other people around here, correct
behaviour. How much it costs to implement the correct behaviour is a
different concern, and perhaps one these people should have considered
when determining whether or not to use O_NONBLOCK...
Your position, I believe has been that the use of select() on a blocking
file descriptor is invalid. Taking this to an extreme, select() should
return EBADF or something to that effect, when passed a file descriptor
that does not have O_NONBLOCK set...
Cheers,
