Are they sent _at once_, or are they sent in sequence?  If they're
sent in sequence, even if it's a very rapid sequence, than Nick's
point still stands.  If you're not attacking the first request which
arrives, the instant the drive code sees it, you're doing something
similar to the anticipatory scheduler.
