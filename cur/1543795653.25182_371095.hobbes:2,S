Every file on that disk could be defective, even those that were never
accessed. This is because of the device buffering which is independent
of the file-system.
I'd advise copying off (using tar) all user-files to backup media.
Then initialize the file-system(s) on the device from scratch.
Reinstall your OS., then restore the user-files from backups or
the files you copied if they were not backed up previously.
Prior to reinstalling, you can save some of the initialization files
that are still readable and ASCII (like /etc/passwd, and /etc/group).
Remember to execute `pwconv` after copying them back onto the new
distribution.
This might be the time to install the "latest and greatest" distribution.
A few years ago, I had a similar situation where I had religiously made
backups every night. I had been backing up corrupt files! Fortunately
most of the data was 'C' language source-files and headers. The
users were able to find and fix them by attempting to recompile them.
One directory tree had about 3,000 files of which at least 1/2 had
to be fixed. This took one user over a month so this was not trivial.
Some of the source-file problems were not visible! There might be
added spaces after some macros. These were the killers to find!
If you have CRC capability on your RAM, make sure it's turned ON in
the BIOS. It's much better to crash as a result of a bad bit then
to have a "few" bad bits in every file.
