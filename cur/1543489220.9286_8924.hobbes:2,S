How about this simple solution - write/use a utility which converts the
data file from BE to LE (once for every file) ?  (of course, you would
need to know the exact structure of the binary data in the file for that).
This worked for me when I needed to compile and execute applications that
used to run on Sparc, and required the original binary data files :-)
