Hi all.
I have some RadioLan-based network cards right here, but i need some
drivers to this thing. I have some doc´s, but none of them tells about
internals of it. I can configure (via dos utility) it io and irq (now is
io=0x300 irq=10, like some other ne), but no one of the 2.2.10 network
modules seems to work for it.
If someone can help me with this hw, i´ll appreciate a lot.
More info on request, but i´m afraid i cannot send a card for tests. But
surely i can test this driver here.
Thanks.
