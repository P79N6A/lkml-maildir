No, I'm advocating to break as little as possible. I'm certainly willing 
to port any interesting feature from Rusty's patches. If one feature 
requires changes to modutils, that's fine.

1. In the past I posted enough example code, which was pretty much 
ignored, why should I think it would be any different this time?
2. Is hotplug that broken, that it wouldn't survive 2.6, so it required a 
complete new implementation? If that should be case I herewith volunteer 
to add module alias support to modutils.
bye, Roman
