Finally got some testing time on this machine.  It turned out that lilo
was silently truncating the command line to 79 characters.  "mem=127M"
was being read as "mem=1".  You get some interesting effects when that
happens, like memory sizes wrapping to ff000001.  Might be worth adding
some checks in parse_mem_cmdline() to pick up silly memory values.
