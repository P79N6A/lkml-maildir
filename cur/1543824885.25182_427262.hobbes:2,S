Thanks, but it's not much use here, since the machine is a PReP powerpc 
machine that can boot one kernel from disk (directly loaded from boot 
partition, no fancy bootloader) or netboot via serial console for test 
kernels. However, if the test kernel hangs, it hangs and I would need 
remote power cycling device that I do not have.
