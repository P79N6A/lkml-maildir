  It can't be done in a manner, more efficient than in userland. If it's
for "atomic operation" sake, you can do the same by renaming within the
filesystem, then copying files ot another one, then renaming the directory
there, so it appears at once. If it's to make it impossible to have any
context switch until your operation finishes, it will make a very scary
DoS possible.
