If we go for a Linux-specific solution anyway, maybe one could add
another send{,to,msg} flag that makes send*(2)'s buffer access
non-atomic. That way, the kernel only needs to make sure the pages
don't disappear, but there's no need for expensive MMU games.
Of course, this would give applications a way for generating packets
with an incorrect TCP/UDP checksum, so maybe that should be protected
by a capability then, maybe CAP_NET_RAW.
