I'm not disagreeing, just letting you know that in this case, the first
IMA patch builds cleanly and works, with each of the subsequent patches
adding new functionality.

hm, i_version seems to be working properly for regular files on ext3.

Previous posting:
"The OS protects against an executable file, already open for write,
from being executed; and an executable file, open for execute, from
being modified.  In the same vein, we want to know that the file
measured is the same file read, that it hasn't been modified.  So, if a
file already open for read is then opened for write, we log it with a
"Time of Measure, Time of Use" error (ToMToU) and invalidate the
PCR.....
This is important when measuring configuration files, shell scripts (not
measured in brpm_check_integrity which are protected by the OS), and
files imported/included by scripts."
Another posting:
"From an integrity perspective, a file measurement might be invalidated
unnecessarily, but it is safe. For any file when opened for write, while
having an existing reader, will cause the file measurement to be
invalidated."
I'm just not seeing a problem. Perhaps because only regular files are
being measured, and of them, only those defined by the policy, which
most likely would not include pseudo filesystems (i.e. sysfs, procfs,
tmpfs, securityfs).

The parameters to the integrity API calls (collect, measure, store, etc)
need to be generic (void *), as different templates measure different
types of data, requiring different parameters.
As Dave Hansen, pointed out, the casting of void pointers is
unnecessary.  This will be cleaned up in the next patch set.
