Hi,
I just thought I should share this with the kernel developer community. 
When I was running my system (AMD Athlon XP 1700+ with Asus A7V133-C) 
with the default BIOS on the motherboard (1007) I experienced several 
problems when trying to run programs. Most of them either Segfaulted or 
caused a bus error. The crashes where usually related to situations 
where a program tried to display an animation or a video. Sometimes the 
system completely froze. I tried to compile the kernel with all kinds of 
different options, tried with and without athlon optimization but 
nothing seemed to work. I thought it might have been related to the 
"Athlon/AGP bug", but the solutions to fix the bug did not work for my 
system.
Then one day I happened to check Asus homepage and found a BIOS update 
for my motherboard. I flashed my BIOS with the new software (1008) and 
now I haven't had any problems. The BIOS came out 8.3.2002, so it's 
quite new. Anyone happen to know what changes where made in the new BIOS 
which solved my problem?
