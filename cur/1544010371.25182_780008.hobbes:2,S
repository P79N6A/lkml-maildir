Can you double check that please?
Suspend/resume are supposted to hotunplug all CPUs except the BP and
then re-online them on resume (with "disable_nonboot_cpus()) . The
re-online initializes MCEs in the standard CPU bootup path.
A good way is to stick a WARN_ON(num_online_cpus() > 1) into
mce_suspend(). I had that here for some time and didn't see
it trigger.
I got a couple of suspend bug fixes in my mce improvement tree, see:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-x86.git;a=history;f=arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce_64.c;h=9512a7eab4e7b03a584f5bb647bd242bd4c003dc;hb=x86/mce
During review it was decided to all defer it to .29 though.
