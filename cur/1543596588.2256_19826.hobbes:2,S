Greetings:
When i used Redhat 7 and kernel 2.2.x y was happy with my souncard, now I
use RedHat 7.1 and Kernel 2.4.x, but sndconfig doesn't configure my
Via82c686 soundcard at all. At the ending it says
via82cxxx codec rate locked at 48khz
I use a Biostar MKE401B Matherboard with on-board sound (AC97)
I've heard about patches for the intel chipsets, does anybody knows if one
for my card has been released, or how to fix this problem...
(my sound is  choppy and XMMS crashes!)
something weird is that sound is good when Linus says:
"Hi, Im Linus Torvalds, and...."
then after sndconfig ends and sound is crying...
