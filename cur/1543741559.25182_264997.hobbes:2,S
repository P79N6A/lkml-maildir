It depends on the intent of the encryption. If the purpose is the 
protect the data, then this is acceptable. In some cases it is more 
important to protect the data than to preserve them.
More to the point, I thought there was a small section of nvram reserved 
to local system use, which the BIOS should not change. The appropriate 
manual is 100 miles away, I have no time to google. Beside which someone 
will pop up with the answer before I could look ;-)
