I was convinced the moment I realized it worked exactly the same as
b43 (if they work the same, I'd rather use the intended driver). The
b43legacy test was more out of desperation than anything serious. I
thought I should share though, since my original question was about
the firmware and because the difference between versions (or lack
thereof) had been discussed in this thread.

Really, the only thing that might have changed is some things that may
have caused noise were turned off -- in other words, there should have
been more noise with the 200 kB/s, but of course that doesn't make
sense. It should be noted though that even at 200 kB/s, the b43 driver
was operating at less than half the speed of bcm43xx. That being said,
I've been trying very hard to repeat this, but cannot. I'll keep
trying though, and make sure to note everything possible if it ever
happens again.

Not currently, but I'll try to find a way to do so -- not sure how
long it'll take.
