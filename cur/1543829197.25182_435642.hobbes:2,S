Indeed.  The motivation behind this came from multipath: people want to
issue certain types of ioctls directly against a dm multipath device and
have them pass through one of the paths to the underlying device.
(Otherwise they'd need a knowledge of dm internals to poke around the tree
of dm devices and probe path statuses to determine the correct path(s) to
use - effectively implementing 'multipath' ioctls themselves from userspace
with unavoidable races.)
