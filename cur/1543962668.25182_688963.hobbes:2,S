Ingo, perhaps it helps if I put it in caps:
YOU TRIED TO PUSH AN INPUT PATCH FOR AN X86 BUG.
Roman's patch is better than adding a select, but your patch would have 
added the select in the completely wrong subsystem.
Why can't you admit the patch you tried to push was wrong?

Roman is still active.

Different to you I actually have some basic understanding how kconfig 
works.
I'm not even sure the semantics of "select follows dependencies" 
would actually be better than what we have today.
