I´ve seen the same behaviour testing SCSI disks with 2.2.16 as well.
2.4.0-t3 scaled dropped from 20 to 12 for two threads and stayed stable
there, while 2.2.16(-SuSE) went from 17 down to 6 (for 8 threads).
I'm testing 2.2.14 (with an IDE disk -d1 IBM DJNA) currently. Wait. . . . . .
It shows the same behaviour as 2.2.16: 
  File   Block  Num  Seq Read    Rand Read   Seq Write  Rand Write
  Dir    Size   Size   Thr Rate (CPU%) Rate (CPU%) Rate (CPU%) Rate (CPU%)
  ------- ------ ------- --- ----------- ----------- ----------- -----------

I have to say that I did do some work in the background in the end, so the
8 thread numbers should be slightly better in reality.
I wonder, why you had such a flat profile for 2.2.15.
Does anybody have an explanation for this?

Oops. PIIX4 should be supported by 2.4 kernels.

Partition table. The mapping is reported by the BIOS, but also stored in the
partition table. The kernel uses the latter.

I don't think so.
Did you enable DMA in the BIOS?
Anyway, using Andre Hedrick´s patches for IDE is a good idea in general.
They are on the kernel mirrors.
