Hmm, this must have been introduced in libc6?  Unfortunately, I don't have
the source code to MAGMA, and the binary I have is statically linked.  It
does not contain the names of the environment variables you mentioned.
I'll arrange a binary linked against glibc2.2, and then your suggestion
will hopefully do the trick.  Thanks for your kind help!
Cheers,
Wayne
