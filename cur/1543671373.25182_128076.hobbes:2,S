I don't care much if the kernel does something to make an application run
better, that's an application problem. But if an application can do
something which hurts the performance of the system as a whole, then the
kernel should protect itself and the rest of the system.
So I'm not advocating that the kernel cater to bash, just that doing
legitimate things with bash not have a disproportionate impact on the rest
of the system.
