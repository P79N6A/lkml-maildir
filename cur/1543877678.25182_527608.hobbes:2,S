Database workload, where the user multi threaded app is constantly accessing 
GBytes of data, so L2 cache hit is very small. If you want to oprofile it, 
with say a CPU_CLK_UNHALTED:5000 event, then find_vma() is in the top 5.
Each time oprofile has an NMI, it calls find_vma(EIP/RIP) and blows out the 
target process cache (usually plugged on the data vma containing user land 
futexes). Event with private futexes, it will probably be plugged on the brk() 
vma.
