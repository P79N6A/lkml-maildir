Oh come on, these things aren't *that* hard to find.  In any case,
judging from the device number 08:01, I suspect you are using SCSI
rather than IDE.  Check your SCSI options.  You must compile in (not as
modules) the SCSI disk driver as well as your host adapter.
If you are indeed using IDE, make sure you are passing the correct root
dev into the booting kernel.  Check your boot loader config (lilo.conf,
likely as not) or try the 'rdev' utility.
