I'm not going to fix bttv 0.7.x (that's the version which is in both
2.4.x and 2.5.x).  The redesigned bttv 0.8.x versions work (they never
used virt_to_bus).  You can fetch them from 
http://bytesex.org/bttv/
bttv 0.8.x depends on some other patches, thus it probably needs some
time before it will show up in 2.5.x.  Expect bttv being broken for a
few releases in 2.5.x kernels.
