"a la" ? Oh pretty, those two words have been picked from french to english
language :-)
I didn't know.
Yes, these parameters displaying a la strace are in my projects, as well as
the return value of the syscalls (and other functions later).

That sounds good. I just need a new entry type for this. I can pass all these
registers on insertion and filter them by syscall number on output stage.
