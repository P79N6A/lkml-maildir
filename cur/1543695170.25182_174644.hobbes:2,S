Hello!
Many drivers are developed outside the kernel tree.  Many drivers start
their existence as separate projects.  It's essential that they are tested
by the users of particular hardware, even if those users don't want to
recompile their kernels.
There should be a standard place for .config in kernel packages.
/proc/config.gz may or may not be popular with distributors.  Besides, it
only gives information for the currently running kernel, but not for e.g.
newly upgraded kernel before the reboot.
Cannot we just install .config to the same directory as modules?  If the
kernel doesn't support modules, then there is no point to compile any new
modules against it.  But if it does, then we can be sure that the modules
correspond to that configuration file, because the modules and .config
would be installed by the same command.
That's why I prefer the "kernel" subdirectory.  It's fully replaced by
"make modules_install", so that the old .config will go away for sure.
Patch against 2.6.0-test8
