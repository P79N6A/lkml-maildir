Subject: [PATCH 06/14] uml: make UML_SETJMP always safe
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

If enable is moved by GCC in a register its value may not be preserved after
coming back there with longjmp(). So, mark it as volatile to prevent this; this
is suggested (it seems) in info gcc, when it talks about -Wuninitialized. I
re-read this and it seems to say something different, but I still believe this
may be needed.
