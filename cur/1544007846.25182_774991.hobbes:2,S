I think yes, although I never tried Plan9 and don't know the details
of the union directory semantics.
At first we thought of providing completely read-only unioning (no
whiteouts, no object creation/removal).  This gets rid of a _lot_ of
complexity.

The plan is to get a simple kernel implementation first which caches
the directory in 'struct file'.
Long term we'll see.  Maybe the userspace implementation is worth
persuing as well for a more "kernel memory friendly" implementation.
