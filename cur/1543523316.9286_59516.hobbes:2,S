Mine does not appear to be a case of extreme high load at all.  The
corruption I have been seeing seems to appear when I do a really big "rm
-rf", or a sometimes a really big kernel compile will break due to an
I/O error in a file.  Normally I might have one or two other compiles
going on in the background, but nothing causing this SMP box to go above
load 2.00...
