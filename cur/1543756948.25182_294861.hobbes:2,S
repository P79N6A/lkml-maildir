On my Thinkpad T30 with a Radeon Mobility M7 LW, I get interesting
console video corruption if I start GDM, switch back to text mode,
then stop it again. X is Xfree86 from Debian/unstable or X.org 6.8.2.
The corruption shows up whenever the console scrolls after X has been
shut down and manifests as horizontal lines spaced about 4 pixel rows
apart containing contents recognizable as the X display. Switch from
vt1 to vt2 and back or visual bell clears things back to normal, but
corruption will reappear on the next scroll.
This has appeared in at least 2.6.11-rc3-mm2 and rc4.
