Nice work, Vatsa. When I wrote the DWRR algorithm, I flattened the
hierarchies into one level, so maybe that approach can be applied to
your code as well. What I did is to maintain task and task group weights
and reservations separately from the scheduler, while the scheduler only
sees one system-wide weight per task and does not concern about which
group a task is in. The key here is the system-wide weight of each task
should represent an equivalent share to the share represented by the
group hierarchies. To do this, the scheduler looks up the task and group
weights/reservations it maintains, and dynamically computes the
system-wide weight *only* when it need a weight for a given task while
scheduling. The on-demand weight computation makes sure the cost is
small (constant time). The computation itself can be seen from an
example: assume we have a group of two tasks and the group's total share
is represented by a weight of 10. Inside the group, let's say the two
tasks, P1 and P2, have weights 1 and 2. Then the system-wide weight for
P1 is 10/3 and the weight for P2 is 20/3. In essence, this flattens
weights into one level without changing the shares they represent.
