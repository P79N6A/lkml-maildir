Well, since others definitely don't see this, including me, and I can do 
things like 62MB exec arrays:
	[torvalds@woody linux]$ echo $(find /home/torvalds/) | wc
	      1  883304 63000962
without getting any overflows (much less just on the kernel sources, which 
is less than a megabyte of pathnames), I think it would be good if you 
were to just instrument the kernel and make it do a "printk()" when it 
returns E2BIG in fs/execve.c (or the NULL returns from get_arg_page()).
Just to figure out *which* test fails for you but apparently nobody else.
