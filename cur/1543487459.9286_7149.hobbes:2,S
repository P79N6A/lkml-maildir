Subject: Resolved: Poor PPP performance in 2.2.x

This is an update to my email from 2/3 to this list.  The original email
with a description of the problem follows this message.
The problem briefly was that I was getting "stalls" or something over ppp
with the 2.2.x kernels.  PPP would stop responding, and an RX error would
appear in "ifconfig ppp0", every few seconds.  Also, a strange bunch of hex
numbers appeared in /var/log/syslog.
The hard disk DMA and IRQ masking suggestions offered no help at all.
I determined that the problem was caused by the bsd_comp module!  I turned
it off in /etc/conf.modules and the problem vanished.  It looks like there
may be something wrong with this module.  I intend to go back through the
kernels until I can find what in that module changed in order to figure
this all out.
Why were so few people seeing the problem?  Perhaps my ISP (Concentric.net)
uses this compression module and many others don't.  Perhaps many others
have disabled this module.  Perhaps it's something about the system yet...
Anyway, at least PPP is working now!
