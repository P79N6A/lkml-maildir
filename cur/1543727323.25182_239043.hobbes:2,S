Just a small clarification.  (Rusty already touched on this briefly, but I think 
he made a mistake.)
If the arch has atomic compare-and-exchange, then the non-contended case is 
entirely userspace and no syscall is needed.  I don't think that the cmpxchg 
need be 64-bit.  From the OLS 2004 talk:
int vfulock_lock (&vfulock, flags, pid, &timeout) {
	unsigned old = VFULOCK_UNLOCKED;
	if (cmpxchg(vfulock,old,pid) != old) return 0;
	return SYSCALL(ufulock_lock,3,vfulock,flags,to);
}
That looks like a 32-bit cmpxchg to me.
Also, Inaky reported general operation about 10% slower than NPTL, but said that 
he wanted to fix that if possible.
