This case also happens on a regular basis in kdump kernels where we
deliberately don't shutdown the hardware before starting the new kernel.
This patch should reduce the need for using irqpoll in that situation
by a small amount.

Looks like a duplicate define here. Don't you want:
+#define IRQ_SPURIOUS_DISABLED 0x00800000 /* IRQ was disabled by the spurious trap */
