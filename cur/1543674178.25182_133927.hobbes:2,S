Who sends the now-incorrect MD5?  The kernel? But since it's been
tampered with, how do you know it sends the trust now-incorrect MD5 sum,
instead of a copy of the original MD5 sum?

What for?
If DRM is tampered with, making it scan itself is pretty useless - once
it has been tampered with, it can no longer be trusted to perform the
self scan.   In other words, such self-scanning is fundamentally flawed.
Read "The inevitability of failure" - pay special attention to the fact
that they *never* recommend anything like self-scanning, but rather
focus on mechanisms to ensure that whatever it was you wanted to
self-scan could never have been tampered with in the first place (thus
making the self-scanning that can't work anyway, a non-issue).

Nevermind that - you don't need to answer.
Read "Reflections on trusting trust" by Ken R.

Your idea is fundamentally flawed. You can always add more layers of
self-checking-self-checkers, but this does not change the fact that the
idea is fundamentally flawed.
I'm sorry - it's not that I don't like you or anything like that - but
the idea is stupid, just give it up   :)
