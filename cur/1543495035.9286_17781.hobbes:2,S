As Alan said, you get it mostly for free.  in the case of the 905b (aside
from sun's stuff, the only 100mb pci card I know of that can do hw csum)
its merely some bits to set in the descriptors that we pass the card
anyway.  but once you do this you can start passing the card iovec style
packets.  this makes frag calculation simple iovec math rather than
copy/csum operations, and in the easiest sendfile() case we can dma pages
right out from the page cache, no memory sitting around in skbs for us to
touch/manage/etc.
of course, the book keeping is not exactly trivial.
