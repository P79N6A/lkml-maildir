Subject: problem with cache flush routine for G5?

We're running into issues with the "flush_data_cache" routine on the G5.
For the G5, the L1 dcache is 32K and the L2 cache is 512K. At 128 
bytes/cacheline, that's 256 and 4096 cachelines, respectively.
In the existing tree, NUM_CACHE_LINES is set to 128*8, or 1024.  Is this 
an oversight or am I missing something?
Also, I'm curious why the dcbf instruction is not used for this.
Chris
