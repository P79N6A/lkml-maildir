if official kernels were being released more rapidly then they are it
wouldn't be much of a problem (I can wait a week or two for this with no
problem) but it's currently several months between releases, and since
there are so many changes there is the potential that a new kernel could
be worse then what you are running.
yes I could download a patch and fix the kernel that way, but while I
understand how simple that is I can already hear the crys from management
about haphazardly patching things that then get put into production.
and as for the vendor kernels, I don't use them becouse they all make a
ton of changes that I don't want to deal with.
the stable kernel releases are a vendor for this situation and this
'vendor' has chosen to consider this bug not critical (along with a couple
others) which is a decision being questioned by folks.
