It's a dual p5-233 box with 128M and aic7xxx.  Unfortunately no oops 
hunting as it's a production box and is back to 2.0.35 while 2.2.2 
recompiles __without__ socket filtering.
2.2.2 ran for ~4 days, after which I applied the filter.h patch, 
recompiled and rebooted.  The box has hung 3 times today, totally 
unresponsive to everything but SysRq.  's' and 'u' fail, but 'b' works 
fine.  Gotta love those hour long fscks.  Finally on the last hang I 
left the box up long enough to see
wait_on_irq, CPU 0:
irq:  2 [0 2]
bh:   0 [0 0]
<[c0109d7d]> <[c0114159]> <[c0146db9]> <[c01263d6]> <[c0107b14]>
come across the console.
