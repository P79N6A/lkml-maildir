   Sorry for the repeat...  I submitted this a couple
of days ago, but I probably should have targetted a
couple of people, so I'll do that now.
The point is that there's some pollution in arch/ppc/config.in
that doesn't allow a G4 user (for example) to configure a
host of PCI devices. The problem is that both branches of a
conditional are evaluated, so only the second ever matters.
The thing looks perfectly valid to a shell-script writer's eye,
but it doesn't work here.
    I have been patching 2.4 this incorrect way for a long
time, but only really got a working kernel lately (paulus'
kernel via rsync).
