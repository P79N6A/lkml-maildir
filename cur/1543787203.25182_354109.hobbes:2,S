I want to get the focus at the complete picture, as this is a rather 
critical area and I will be satisfied, as soon as I can see all 
consequences and possibilities have been considered.

If that's case, you're hopefully not afraid of a few questions? Why do I 
have to take the code as is and just believe the claims about it?
I like improvements as everyone, but I also want to verify them and look 
at the alternatives and I can't see anything wrong with it.

I'm not saying that the idea is wrong, the general direction is fine, but 
some course correction should be possible?
