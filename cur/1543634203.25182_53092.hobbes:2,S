Okay. I tried the ieee1394-508.tar.gz tar-ball at home, replacing
../linux/drivers/ieee1394 directory contents of Linux version 2.4.18.
I have sbp2.o inserted by initrd. It initializes, but doesn't find
any devices. If, once the machine is up, I remove the module and then
re-install it, it finds the two devices that I have on the Firewire.
I have been able to make an e2fs file-system on the 80 Gb drive.
I can also create a large file on the drive. But... The following
will lock up... `cp /dev/sdd /dev/null`, the raw device being /dev/sdd.
The disk drive light comes on, then stays on forever. I get error
messages about "resetting the drive", and I can't get control from
any terminal. If I power off the drive, then power it back on, the
process reading from the drive, enters the 'D' state (forever), but
I can get control from another virtual terminal and reboot the machine.
There is something, probably in SCSI, that won't allow the root file-
system to be unmounted so there is a long fsck upon reboot.
Anyway. I have a setup at home that can be used to test anything.
I think the hangup comes from the raw-read length being greater
than the "payload", but I'm not sure.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
