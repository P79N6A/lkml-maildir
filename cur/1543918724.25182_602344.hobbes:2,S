So what happens if I have three different FUSE mounts, all under heavy
write pressure?  It's not a FUSE problem, it's a VM problem as far as
I can see.   All I did was extrapolate from the 50% number (where did
that come from?) and triple it to go over 100%, since we obviously
shouldn't take 100% of any zone, right?
So the real cure is to have some way to rate limit Zone usage, making
it harder and harder to allocate in a zone as the zone gets more and
more full.  But how do you do this in a non-deadlocky way?  
Buy hey, I'm not that knowledgeable about the VM.
