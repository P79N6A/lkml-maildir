I would prefer that zerocopy code remain out of all official kernels
until zerocopy itself is in said kernels.  It's experimental code that
simply cannot work in its present form, due to lack of infrastructure in
the general kernel.  And being based on experimental code itself, there
is definitely the potential for changes yet.
Remember:  we are in a stable series of kernels.  This is experimental
code.  Maintain a separate branch of development like everyone else. 
:)   Yes it's a bit more effort, but that's what being a maintainer is
all about.  The kernel needs a -stable- starfire.c, let's talk about
adding experimental code later.
BTW, I would suggest looking at Jes' acenic.c as an example of a 2.4
driver that is clean but also [hopefully!] works under 2.2.
