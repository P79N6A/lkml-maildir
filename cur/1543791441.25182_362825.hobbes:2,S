Ok, segmentation fault, again:
$ ./testprogs/waitstatus $[0xb7f]
WSTOPSIG(status) is 11
The signal is: Segmentation fault

Oh, sorry.
Can you just try doing a "make clean" and forcing a full recompilation? In any 
case, I will try investigating further... I'll probably request you to give 
me the complete binary (without debug info and compressed) along with 
your .config. Please save them for now, I must check further before...
For now, IIRC you can keep running with mode=tt, right?
