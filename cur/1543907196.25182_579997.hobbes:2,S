Not sure about this - the placement of file headers in romfs is
completely unspecified (a linked list is used), file names in
directories are not required to be in a sorted order...  Of course, a
particular genromfs implementation could always produce the same
bytestream for a given set of files, but the format itself does not
really have any particular advantages.

You add padding between the file header and data.  But you can also
add padding before the file header to make it end on a block boundary;
I don't see any requirement that the next file header must be placed
immediately after the previous file data (the header contains an
explicit pointer to the next file header in the directory).  The only
file header which has a fixed position is the first file header in the
root directory - but it should be the "." entry, which does not
contain any data and therefore does not require alignment; all other
file headers can be placed at arbitrary positions.
And if you add padding before file headers, you do not need to change
the filesystem format at all - just check ROMFS_I(i)->i_dataoffset in
romfs_read_inode() and select your new aops if the offset is
appropriately aligned.  This way you will get perfect compatibility in
both directions - a filesystem with aligned file data will just
perform faster with a patched kernel.  And genromfs could even choose
to align only some files (e.g., bigger than some threshold).
