unbindable mounts were designed to overcome the proliferation problem.
Your steps should be something like this:
mount --make-rshared /
mkdir -p /mnt/ns
mount --bind /mnt/ns /mnt/ns
mount --make-unbindable /mnt/ns
mkdir -p /mnt/ns/$USER
mount --rbind / /mnt/ns/$USER
mount --make-rslave /mnt/ns/$USER
mount --set-flags --recursive -oallowusermnt /mnt/ns/$USER
chroot /mnt/ns/$USER
su - $USER
try this and your proliferation problem will disappear. :-)

the unbindable mount will just provide you permanent relief.

For consistency reason, one can propagate all the flags. But
propagating only those flags that interfere with shared-subtree
semantics should suffice.
wait...Dave's read-only bind mounts infact need the ability to
selectively make some mounts readonly. In such cases propagating
the read-only flag will just step on Dave's feature. Wont' it?
