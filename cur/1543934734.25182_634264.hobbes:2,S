Hi,
I found this one today:
http://securitytracker.com/alerts/2007/Oct/1018782.html
In the git changelog:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=utils/util-linux-ng/util-linux-ng.git;a=commit;h=ebbeb2c7ac1b00b608390595783
7a271e80b187e
noone leaves any word about privilege escalation.
Is it really possible to get root privileges with this bug or are there 
people who just write "may be used to escalate privileges" near any bug 
which has something to do with "setuid" or "setgid"?
Thanks in advance
CU
Manuel
