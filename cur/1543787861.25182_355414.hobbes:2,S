Hi,
We're having similar problems with 9500S-4LP and two Hitachi 250GB SATA
disks. 
Currently we are running 2.6.12.5 and its 3w-9xxx driver. We have tried
numerous 2.4 (Red Hat and kernel.org) and 2.6 kernels and 3w-9xxx drivers
(kernel and 3ware.com). 
The results it more or less the same: on 2.4 it corrupts data and is slow,
on 2.6 it doesn't corrupt data, but is slow.
Our workload is VMWare GSX server. Multiple readers/writers will grind the
performance to halt.
We've tried:

             blockdev -setra 16384 /dev/sda
-     different kernel IO schedulers
-     parameters such as
                blockdev --setra 8192 /dev/vg0/root 
                echo 300 > /sys/block/sda/queue/iosched/read_expire 
                echo 5 > /sys/block/sda/queue/iosched/writes_starved
None of this seems to make much difference.
Please drop me a note if you ever get any light on this issue...
