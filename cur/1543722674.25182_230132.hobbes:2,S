I was talking about access to the pages through the user page tables,
only.  You can't really fully prevent other access to them, because some
other kernel user could always do something like kmap() and write to the
page.  There's probably some handy-dandy way to trap these kinds of
accesses in hardware, but Linux itself certainly can't provide that
guarantee without some restructuring to check for these areas any time
that a set_pte() is done.  
Remember, we don't do things like rmap for the *kernel* users of pages.

You'll also have a generic problem with anything that does DMA, or that
uses the kernel page tables of any kind (kmap, vmalloc, etc...).
The DMA problem is a lot easier when there's an IOMMU, and even easier
on a partitioned ppc64 system where we have a virtualization layer to
take care of any areas under DMA that might undergo remapping.
