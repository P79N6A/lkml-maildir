OK, then your "exclusive" cpusets aren't really exclusive at all, since
they have other stuff running in them. The fact that you may institute
the stuff early enough to avoid most things falling into this doesn't
really solve the problems, AFAICS. 
Or perhaps we end up cpuset alpha and beta that you created, and we create
parallel cpusets that operate on the same sched_domain tree to contain the
other random stuff.
Kind of "cpu groups" and "task groups", where you can have multiple task
groups running on the same cpu group (or subset thereof), but not overlapping 
different cpu groups. Then we can have one sched domain setup per cpu group,
or at least the top level entry in the main sched domain tree. This way the
scheduler might have a hope of working within this system efficiently ;-)
