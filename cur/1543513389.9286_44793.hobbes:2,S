First it hasn't to do with forwarding. Try:
PC-ThS:[~]# ifconfig dummy0 192.168.65.1
PC-ThS:[~]# ping -c 1 192.168.65.1
PING 192.168.65.1 (192.168.65.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.65.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=0.5 ms
--- 192.168.65.1 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.5/0.5/0.5 ms
PC-ThS:[~]# ifconfig dummy0 down        
PC-ThS:[~]# ping -c 1 192.168.65.1
PING 192.168.65.1 (192.168.65.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.65.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=0.5 ms
--- 192.168.65.1 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.5/0.5/0.5 ms
This applies to all network interfaces I have tested so far (eth0, ppp0)
and this problem also has been reported several times to this list. I
think there is a workaround with a shell script somewhere, but I forgot
how it worked. Anyway, I also consider this as a bug but people have
decided it isn't as far as I remember. 
BTW, I am using 2.2.13pre17.
