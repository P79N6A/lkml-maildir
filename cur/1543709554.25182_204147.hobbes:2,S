In-house OS emulator.  For some reason it wants to be able to flush the 
cache.  I don't know why.

It did in 2.4, and we added a syscall to export it to userspace.  Now 
I'm supposed to figure out what to do for 2.6, and it appears that the 
kernel version is gone and the one in boot is screwed.
The only remaining ppc version of flush_data_cache is used by 
flush_instruction_cache in arc/ppc/boot/common/util.S
There is also another version of flush_instruction_cache implemented in 
arch/ppc/kernel/misc.S.
Here are the suspicious instances of flush_instruction_cache in 
arch/ppc/boot:
boot/prep/head.S:       bl      flush_instruction_cache
boot/common/util.S:_GLOBAL(flush_instruction_cache)
boot/simple/relocate.S: b       flush_instruction_cache
boot/simple/relocate.S: b       flush_instruction_cache
boot/simple/misc-embedded.c:    flush_instruction_cache();
