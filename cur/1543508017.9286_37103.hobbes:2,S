   Can someone more knowledgable than me tell of the current status of
threads in Linux on SMP and some history ?
   In particular:
    * can two threads from the same process run on two different cpus ?
    * what happens in event of cache thrashing ? Is there any code to
      optimize for this situation ? (have no idea)
    * are threaded programs guaranteed not to run slower on SMP in
      comparasion to UP systems ?
    * was this situation always this way (i.e. 2.0.*, 2.2.* and 2.3.*)
    * is there any way for a process to request that it's threads should
      run on the same cpu ?
                      thank you very much
