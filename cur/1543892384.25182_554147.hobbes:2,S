Sure - the key is that the ns subsystem uses container_clone() to
automatically create a new container (on sys_unshare() or clone(2)
with certain flags) and move the current task into it.  Let's say
we have done
	mount -t container -o ns,cpuset nsproxy /containers
and we, as task 875, happen to be in the topmost container:
	/containers/
Now we fork task 999 which does an unshare(CLONE_NEWNS), or we just
clone(CLONE_NEWNS).  This will create
	/containers/node_999
and move task 999 into that container.  Except that when it tries
attach_task() it is refused by cpuset.  So the container_clone() fails,
and in turn the sys_unshare() or clone() fails.  A login making use
of the pam_namespace.so library would fail this way with the
ns and cpuset subsystems composed.
We could special case this by having
kernel/container.c:container_clone() check whether one of the subsystems
is cpusets and, if so, setting the defaults for mems and cpus, but
that is kind of ugly.  I suppose as a cleaner alternative we could 
add a container_subsys->inherit_defaults() handler, to be called at
container_clone(), and for cpusets this would set cpus and mems to
the parent values - sibling exclusive values.  If that comes to nothing,
then the attach_task() is still refused, and the unshare() or clone()
fails, but this time with good reason.
thanks,
