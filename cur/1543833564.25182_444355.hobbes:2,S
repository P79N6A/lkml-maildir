You still need the apply alloc_skb-false-positive.patch as it just
avoids a false positive (I'll add it to kmemleak 0.9). Does anything
change with this (and the context_struct_... one)?

I would also need to investigate why the report shows some orphan
pointers without any back-trace information. It seems to disappear
after a while.
Thanks.
