The assembler doesn't use nops for alignment -- it inserts longer
instructions that are effectively nops, either 1 or two.  For larger
stretches, the assembler inserts a jmp itself for alignment.
Regardless, I'd expect the page_fault path to occur far more often than
any of the other fault/exception handlers that lead to error_code.  So
much more that not aligning error_code is probably the right thing to do.
