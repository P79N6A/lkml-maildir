Yes, I use it as synchronization mechanism for my buffer management algorithm
in LTTng. Since I write in per-cpu buffers and want to be as reentrant
as possible wrt other contexts (dealing with NMI as worse case, but also
applies to MCE..), I use local_cmpxchg to reserve space in my buffers.
It is faster than the standard cmpxchg.
