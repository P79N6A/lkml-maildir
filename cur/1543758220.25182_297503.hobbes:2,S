Oh, it's probably the new radeonfb, I have no doubt about that, but I
think the problems has to do with a bogus mode. Maybe set_par is simply
failing and the fbdev layer still tries to tap the card or something
like that. Please, enable verbose debug, add some printk's around
set_par to check what the mode looks like and what gets ioremap'ed.
