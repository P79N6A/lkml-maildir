    Yeah, but that's two disks containing compressed content.  The 3 NT
    bootstrap disks are uncompressed, and the largest lkm is 380k (NTFS);
    If you compress the three NT boot floppies (NT 4.0 Build 1381) with
    bzip2, the resulting archive is 1408261 bytes long, which is enough
    to fit on a single high-density floppy.
    The NT kernel is large (880k), but I don't think it's compressed...
    No, it isn't.  When I gzip it, it goes down to 470k.
    I suppose it's fortunate for the Unix side that MS was sloppy when
    they built their installer;  I'd suspect that if they used a
    syslinux'ed installer they could do a Mastodon and have a single-
    floppy image.

    Tell that to my corporate masters.  If you can convince my boss and the
    marketing and sales people to dump NT for Mastodon (or any of the
    other Linux distributions), I might even pay you for it.  But unless you
    can bring a powerpoint replacement, a Filemaker pro replacement, and an
    Office 9x replacement to the table, I suspect that you may not be overly
    successful in your efforts.

    You might as well give up on Linux now, because we already have
    patches going out that introduce new and improved bugs.   That's
    life, and you're going to have to deal with it.
