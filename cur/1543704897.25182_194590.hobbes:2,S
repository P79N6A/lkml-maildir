That assumes that the access happened with preempt off ?
That's fine if it's guaranteed that the MCE still happened inside 
readl/writel. But if it's delayed longer for some reason there is no guarantee 
that you can find back to the CPU that caused the fault.
Putting it into the pci_dev and using RCU would be probably better.
