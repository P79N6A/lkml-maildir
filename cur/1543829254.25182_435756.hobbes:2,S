That's what I thought too. But adding delays to the screen accessors is not
the correct fix. The screen buffer accessors, scr_readw() and scr_writew()
make assumptions that are not correct in all cases, that the screenbuffer
is either in system RAM or video RAM, never in both. (vgacon's screenbuffer
is video RAM while the rest of the console drivers have it in system RAM.
But you can have vgacon and fbcon compiled at the same time, for example, and
this basically screws up the screen accessors, especially in non-x86 archs.)
So a revamp of vgacon may be necessary, by placing the screen buffer in
system RAM. This will entail a lot of work, so the revamp will take some
time.

I was hoping that's it's the memcpy() that's buggy when the source/destination
is video RAM.  That would be an easy fix, but it seems I'm out of luck here.

Sure, as long as it's GPL-compatible, properly written, and correctly
Signed-off.
