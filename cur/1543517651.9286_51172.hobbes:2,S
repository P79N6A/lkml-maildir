Hi
As of 2.3.27 mmapping of /proc/self/mem is not possible.
svgalib (in background mode uses it as follows):
1.  frame buffer (at physical 0x000a0000) is mapped into program's
    memory space (at GM=0x43210000, for example)
2.  program writes to screen.
3.  a console switch occurs (program goes to background)
4.  svgalib allocates a virtual frame buffer (at VBF), and copies the
    physical one to it.
5.  svgalib calls mmap(GM,0x10000,,,proc_self_mem_fd,VBF), so that
    writes at 0x4321xxxx go to the virtual frame buffer, and not to the
    physical one.
6. when the program returns to foreground, svgalib copies virtual frame
   buffer to physical.
Now, step 5 is broken. Is the same result (that of the mmap in
step 5) achievable by other means?
