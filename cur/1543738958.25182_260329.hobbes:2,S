Subject: RE: Getting a process' EIP address (and other registers)
The EIP is not on the user space stack. It's a system call, not a
function
call, and the EIP is where the system call is made.
Upon entering kernel all registeres are saved on the kernel stack. You
can
get it by the following:
struct pt_regs *regs = *(((struct pt_regs *)(THREAD_SIZE + (unsigned
long)current)) - 1);

	Thanks for the help. I think it's working now. I did have to
drop the pointer dereference at the front of the statement to get it to
compile, but my register values are now more consistent and believable.
