Subject: drivers/usb/serial/mos7720.c: inconsequent NULL checking

The Coverity checker noted the following inconsequent NULL checking in 
drivers/usb/serial/mos7720.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
static void mos7720_close(struct usb_serial_port *port, struct file *filp)
{
...
        /* While closing port, shutdown all bulk read, write  *
         * and interrupt read if they exists                  */
        if (serial->dev) {
                dbg("Shutdown bulk write");
                usb_kill_urb(port->write_urb);
                dbg("Shutdown bulk read");
                usb_kill_urb(port->read_urb);
        }
        data = 0x00;
        send_mos_cmd(serial, MOS_WRITE, port->number - port->serial->minor,
                     0x04, &data);
...
<--  snip  -->
Note that "send_mos_cmd(serial,...)" dereferences "serial->dev".
