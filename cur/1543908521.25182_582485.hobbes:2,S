I don't really know the details here, so I could be completely wrong.
However, generally, forcing HAL and kernel to be in sync really
looks to me like a non-ideal way to handle interface change.
For example, this would mean that one can't use the same kernel
for multiple distributions, and for a person like me
that needs to switch distros all the time, it seems like a pain.
Could not the kernel expose both new and old interfaces
somehow, so that HAL can be updated without recompiling the kernel?
For example, there could be a sysfs interface which let the HAL set
the desired interface version.
Couldn't that work?
This seems easy to code up.
Want a patch like that?
