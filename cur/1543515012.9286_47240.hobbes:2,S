Hmm.. This is really still not enough.
What about machines with more than 4GB of physical memory?
The fact is, that if you use GFP_BIGMEM, you really should use the
__get_pages() function, instead of using any function that returns a
virtual address. And __get_pages() will correctly return a "struct page
*", which doesn't have any of these wrap-around issues..
(or you can use the "get_free_highpage()" function that is just a wrapper
around __get_pages() to get a single page).

It's needed in the original bigmem set, but as far as I can tell, for the
extended bigmem (ie "highmem") that we use in the current 2.3.x, this
isn't even an issue any more..

Well, the "other way" is what 2.3.x does already..
I certainly agree that it was more than a one-liner change to do the
"bigmem" to "highmem" conversion, and I hated doing it this late in the
2.3.x game, but exactly because of these kinds of issues it was also
obviously the right thing to do - we're going to have to live with high
memory for the 2.4.x lifetime, and I wanted it to be done right..
