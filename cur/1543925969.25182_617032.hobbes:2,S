If you screen all bugzilla reports then you'll know that bug #9356 arrived
at about 1400 GMT yesterday.  It's hardly surprising then that your utterly
crappy responses to Natalie's message (which, incidentally, wasn't copied
to me) sent within 24 hours of that report cause *great* annoyance.

On the whole you do an excellent job with feeding the bug reports to
people, and while I recognise that you're only human, things do
occasionally go wrong.  For instance, sending clearly marked Samsung
S3C bugs to me rather than Ben Dooks (who's in MAINTAINERS for those
platforms.)

So how are they lost when they're held in a moderation queue and are
either accepted, a useful response given to the original poster, or
are forwarded to someone who can deal with the issue.
I don't think "subscribers only" describes my lists - we don't devnull
stuff just because the poster is not a subscriber.
