How is linking back a file into the normal namespace anymore
a security hole as having it under /proc or keeping an fd to it open?
I've searched google on the subject but couldn't find anything relevant.
Yes this has been proposed a few times for both BSD and Linux, often
in combination with "unattached open" (O_NULL or somesuch) that opens
a file with a nlink count of 0. It's supposed to be a perfect way to
create a new file and link it atomically into place without creating
(named) tempfiles.
