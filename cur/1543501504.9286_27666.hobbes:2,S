Subject: Timer robustness patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/7/2/153

This small patch should improve timer robustness a lot, especially if
someone changed timer->expires when they shouldn't.  cascade_timers now
knows how to handle timers that are put right back into the list they were
already in. Previously this would lead to corrupted timer lists, and/or
timers trigging at very strange times.
As an added bonus, you can now make timers with more than 2^32 jiffies
timeout on 64 bit architectures (whee! :)
The patch is relative to 2.3.7, but should work on many older versions as
well.
