REALLY? Who are you kidding. Windows has no such capability.
Check \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC\* and see who they stole
the TCP/IP stack from!
Further, when you perform normal user->TCP/IP operations, you
get checksumming for free as part of the copy operation. It's
only when you don't even copy data that you can get any advantage
of not checksumming. That's why sendfile disables it.
