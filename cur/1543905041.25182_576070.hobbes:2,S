But that's wrong. The 'wait_runtime' might have been negative at this
point (i.e. a task is in the negative 'run-time' balance wrt the
'etalon' nice-0 task). Your change ends up helping such a task to
actually stay closer to the 'left most' element of the tree (or to be
it) and not "further behind in the queue" as your intention is.
I don't know Volanomark's details so refrain from speculating on why
this change "improves" benchmark results indeed (maybe some afected
tasks have
positive 'wait_runtime's on average for this setup).
If you want to make sure (just for a test) a yeilding task is not the
left-most (at least) for some short interval of time (likely to be <=
1 tick), take a look at yield_task_fair() in e.g. cfs-v15.

40 or 80 % is still a huge regression.
