I don't think this "event notification" system should be used for error
event notification.  For errors, you want to never drop them, or want to
rely on userspace reading the sysfs attribute file in time before it
changes again.
And as my previous message shows, I think we just evolved back to the
current hotplug interface, which really isn't a good one for errors :)

That's a great start.  Hopefully it will help in figuring out what error
messages should be standardized on across drivers that belong to the
same class.
