In fact, I think this is it!
The load average is not calculated every tick, because that's not just 
expensive, but we also want to have some time-based decay. So it's 
calculated every LOAD_FREQ ticks.
And guess what: LOAD_FREQ is defined to be exactly five seconds.
So imagine if the timer gets to be in sync with another event that happens 
every five seconds - let's pick at random a 5-second JBD transaction 
thing?
Anders - does this idiotic patch make a difference for you?
Without this, I can easily imagine that the rounding code tends to try to 
round to an even second, and the load-average code generally also runs at 
even seconds!
