While building a kernel with the NIST IPSEC module code in it over the
weekend, I got a build failure in ~/net/ipv4/ip_output.c  The offending
snippet of code is:
	#ifdef CONFIG_FIREWALL
                switch (call_out_firewall(PF_INET, rt->u.dst.dev,
skb->nh.iph, N
                case FW_QUEUE:
                        kfree_skb(skb);
                        continue;
                case FW_BLOCK:
                case FW_REJECT:
                        kfree_skb(skb);
                        err = -EPERM;
                        goto error;
                }
I think the "continue" after kfree_skb(skb) should be a "break" instead?
This line is even in the 2.3.3 development code.
Is it in fact a bug?
Thanks.
