direct-io has lost its challenge ;)
I'd love to see the result of some pagecache testing on that
setup if you have time.
Nothing fancy - just:
for i in $(each ext2 mountpoint)
do
	dd if=/dev/zero of=$i/foo bs-1M count=4000 &
done
vmstat 1
and
for i in $(each ext2 mountpoint)
do
	cat $i/foo > /dev/null &
done
vmstat 1
Linus's current BK tree has a few warmups which will help the
