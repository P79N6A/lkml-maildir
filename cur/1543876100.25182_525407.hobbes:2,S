Exactly. If driver-private data structures have different lifetime
than device abstractions (like they seem to have with scsi and ide)
then you split them and refcount separately. We are just arguing where
to put the line. You want to split devices and kobjects and rework
infrastructure and I am saying that we already have infrastructure we
need and that split shoud be between generic device structure and
driver-managed device structure.
