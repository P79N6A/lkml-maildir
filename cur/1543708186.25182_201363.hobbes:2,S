I think that this is off topic for this list; so I will email you direct, 
quite soon, with some reasons and links.
Nothing wrong with using RedHat, nice distro; but your question was about
building with 2.6.x headers.  The functionality of 2.6.x is needed by glibc; 
but not in user space.  How that is achieved is quite difficult.
