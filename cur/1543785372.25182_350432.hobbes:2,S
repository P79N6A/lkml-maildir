Hello,
on one computer, which I wanted to switch from 2.6.13 to 2.6.14-rc1 I was
forced to use CONFIG_PM, look:
thomas@tv2:~/linux-2.6.14-rc1> zgrep CONFIG_PM /proc/config.gz 
# CONFIG_PM is not set
thomas@tv2:~/linux-2.6.14-rc1> zcat /proc/config.gz > .config 
thomas@tv2:~/linux-2.6.14-rc1> make oldconfig
...
*
* Power management options (ACPI, APM)
*
Power Management support (PM) [Y/?] y
  Power Management Debug Support (PM_DEBUG) [N/y/?] (NEW) 
I never had question if I want to have CONFIG_PM, the "y" was already 
there.
Is this wanted?
      Thomas
