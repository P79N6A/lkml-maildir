I didn't claim that flush_dcache_page(virt_to_page(virt)) is not expected
to work.  I claim that flush_dcache_page is expected to be a noop rather
than an oops on a kmalloced page.

What general issue?

The scsi_tgt_if.c use you show above?  That's not dealing with
kmalloced pages, is it?  True, the pages it is dealing with don't
have page->mapping set, so those architectures which use page->mapping
to find what to do in their flush_dcache_page, won't do anything there
in their flush_dcache_page.  Whether that's a bug or not, I wouldn't
pretend to know; but it's nothing to do with the present discussion.
Please see Documentation/cachetlb.txt: flush_dcache_page is about
pagecache pages mapped into userspace.  We don't use kmalloc for those,
but we do sometimes need to flush_dcache_page in places which commonly
deal with pagecache pages, but sometimes handle kmalloc'ed buffers too.
Luckily we don't have to deal with buffers in which the first page is
kmalloced and the next comes from pagecache.
