Are these prototypes required?  MIPS and PARISC will need wrappers to
fix them if they are.  These two architectures have an ABI which
requires 64-bit arguments to be passed in aligned pairs of registers,
but glibc doesn't know that (and given the existence of syscall(3),
can't do much about it even if it knew), so some of the arguments end up
in the wrong registers.
Things will go much better if we can prototype these as:
asmlinkage ssize_t sys_preadv(unsigned int fd, const struct iovec __user *vec,
				loff_t pos, unsigned long vlen);
asmlinkage ssize_t sys_pwritev(unsigned int fd, const struct iovec __user *vec,
				loff_t pos, unsigned long vlen);
That way 'pos' ends up split between arg2 and arg3 and vlen ends up in
arg4 instead of having vlen in arg2 and pos in arg3 and arg4 which then
have to be munged to be in arg4 and arg5 by a compat wrapper.
I seem to recall the s390 folks having some concerns with this kind of
thing too, but I forget what they are, so I'll let them weigh in on
this.
By the way, why did you make 'fd' an unsigned long?  The rest of the
kernel uses unsigned int.
