Well there are conditions in which mmapped file pages can get converted to
anonymous pages due to truncate(), but I have a feeling that we stopped
that from happening.
Also there are situations in which truncate of a still-committing ext3
pagecache page can cause the page to remain ont he page LRUs - it's been
truncated from the file, but ext4 still has a hold of it for journalling
purposes.
You cold lock the pages then check ->mapping.
