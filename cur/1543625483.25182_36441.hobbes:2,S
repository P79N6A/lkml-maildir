Subject: remount file-system mount change?

Any `mountd` gurus,
This kind of entry in /etc/exports used to let anybody in
the world read/write/delete from the file-system identified.
#/etc/exports
/scratch	*(rw,no_root_squash)
I don't know when it stopped working, but now I have to put in
individual host-names to allow access.
Is this part of some new 'security' thing or is it a bug? If it's
part of some new security thing, how do I reasonably enter the
IP addresses of a few hundred unknown lap-tops and other dynamic
systems?
If it's a bug, some more information is that from host 'foo' it is
no longer possible to do:
	mount foo:/scratch /mnt
...regardless of whatever is in /etc/exports, including 'localhost'
or specific IP addresses. I can't network-mount a host onto itself
anymore. This was useful to see what a remote-host would encounter
with, for instance, sym-links.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
