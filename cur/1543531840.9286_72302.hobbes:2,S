Basically it means that process in question is stuck in the middle of
exit. And just a zombie wouldn't suffice - it needs to get stuck in
do_exit() somewhere between task_lock() and task_unlock(). Could you
do the following:
1) add int foo_flag=0; into the beginning of exit.c
2) add extern int foo_flag; EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo_flag); into ksyms.c
3) put the following into foo.c and build it as a module:
#include <linux/module.h>
init_module() {
	foo_flag ^= 1;
	return -1;
}
4) put into the interesting interval of do_exit()
	if (foo_flag)
		printk(KERN_DEBUG "...something...\n");
(interesting == between task_lock() and task_unlock()).
Now insmod foo.o will switch this debugging stuff on/off.
Turn it on (insmod foo.o), reproduce the hang and turn it off again (one
more insmod foo.o). And look at the logs. Reasonable things to print are
fields of tsk - you definitely want tsk->pid, for one. Oh, and place where
it hangs, indeed ;-)
I would do all this crap myself, but I don't have Wine or any Windows
software (or Windows itself, for that matter).
