This means, it's the same problem.
I also tried the elevator fixes from Peter Osterlund posted in LKML
yesterday, which did not change anything for me. So it really seems, that
the culprit is the scheduler.
I'm not an expert in that area, so I am a little bit stuck right now. If
anybody has an suggestion, what we can investigate next (like backing out
only parts of the scheduler patch or place some strategic printf's), I am
willing to try this on my machine.
By the way, I also tried Ingo's scheduler yesterday, which at least didn't
show up with these problems. It even survived some hours of stress
testing.
