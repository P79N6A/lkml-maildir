And it will anyhow require a full evaluation of MAKEDEV (debian's one
anyhow), as it really put a lot of extra crap in.  With Greg's patches I
only need to worry about /dev/core, /dev/std{in,out,err} and alsa.  The
question is now also how do you 'qualify' an device to have sysfs
support.  Sure some is static like /dev/null, but over here /dev/hda is
pretty static as well =)
