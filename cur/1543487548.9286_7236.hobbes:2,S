LZS compression is available for ISDN.

It works quite nicely here, and I believe I'm talking to Ascends at the other 
end (Demon Internet, UK).
It's a shame that the module only works with one of the three PPP
implementations in 2.2 (sync-over-ISDN, async, sync-over-leased-lines). I
believe all three are going to be combined soon in the 2.3 series, and then the 
new compression methods should work over every medium.
