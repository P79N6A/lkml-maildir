No properly configured ethernet hub or router will return you the
same packet you sent.  You can get some of this information out of the
drivers though, as their hardware knows the link state, at least the
physical layer.
Check out Becker's mii-diag program.  There are some options
in it to dump out all kinds of neat information about the drivers
and link condition.

Ping your switch.  Or use something like ethernet channel bonding.
If both ports are up, then you should be able to send a pkt
from one NIC with your other NICs MAC in it, and the switch should deliver
that pkt to your other NIC.  However, if you don't receive the packet, you
cannot determine which one of your links/NICs is bad without going to
a third party (which I suggest should be your switch itself).
