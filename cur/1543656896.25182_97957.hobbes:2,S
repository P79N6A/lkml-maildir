Userspace can skip the "popfl" with a well-timed signal.  If the
"sysexit" path leaves the kernel with an unsafe eflags, that will
propagate into the signal handler.
AFAICT, one of these is required:
	1. eflags must be safe before leaving kernel space, or
	2. setup_sigcontext() must clean it up (it already does clear TF).
