You can remove the "default n".

After reading this thread, I do understand why you write once 
"GCC version 4.1" and once "gcc version 4.2".
But for the normal user this will be quite confusing.
What about simply removing the first sentence of the help text since 
it's anyway handled by the NOTE?

You can remove the "default n".

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
