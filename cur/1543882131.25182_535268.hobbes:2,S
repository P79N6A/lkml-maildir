From looking at pm_ops which I was recently working with a lot, it seems
that it was designed by somebody who was reading the ACPI documentation
and was otherwise pretty clueless, even at that level std tries to look
like suspend. IMHO that is one of the first things that should be ripped
out, no pm_ops for STD, it's a pain to work with.
