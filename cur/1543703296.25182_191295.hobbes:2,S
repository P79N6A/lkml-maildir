Well, properly or not, everything I tested short of detailed benchmarking
since -test3 has had no problems and always reported stats fine.

Thanks. I vaguely remember trying something like this, for a completely
different and forgotten issue, when I first started playing with ACPI.
It turned out to not be necessary so that file has been erased from my
memory and apparently over-written too much to be recovered.
It seems the new BIOS has also given me better backlight and IDE
power saving support (translation watching DVD's while on battery now
sucks). It seems as if I'm going to have to become an ACPI expert to get
some control over what this thing's doing and when. Like, it suspends
fine in Windows but not in Linux. (Actually, it suspends fine in Linux
too - It just won't wake up.) Can you point me to some references that
will help be build my own tables without burning my machine up?

And I've been puzzling over your sig since I first saw it. I still
don't get it and it's driving me nuts.... When you have 13-15 high card
points and 5 strong hearts?
