No, I said and say that V3 should not have features added to it, because
features should not be added to a stable branch.  Bug fixes are good.
There are a few V3 bug fixes where the fix is so deep that it belongs in
V4, all of the ones that I can think of at the moment are ones requiring
disk format changes.
Note that in V4, disk format changes are no longer deep fixes because of
plugins.

No, we will stop adding features to it at some point, only add bug
fixes, and let it become stable enough for mission critical use.  Of
course, with plugins this becomes more complicated of a policy because
smaller releases with more orthogonal features are easier and more
tempting, and it becomes tempting to version and release plugins rather
than the FS, so I am not sure exactly how this will play out yet.  I
think we will have an option to select experimental plugins individually.
