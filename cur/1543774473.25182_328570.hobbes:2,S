all of these traces seem to have lockupcli involved - is that correct?  
lockupcli is just a userspace test-app to artificially trigger a 
hard-lockup (it disables interrupts and goes into an infinite loop). So 
the NMI watchdog triggering on lockupcli would be normal and expected.  
So once this works, it would be nice to reproduce whatever hard lockup 
you are seeing and see whether the NMI watchdog produces any output to 
the serial log. (if such log is supposed to be included in your dmesg 
then it somehow got intermixed with lockupcli logs)
