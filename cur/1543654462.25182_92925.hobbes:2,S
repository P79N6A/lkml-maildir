I agree, the names are a bit wierd (there were earlier get_symbol()
implementations I cribbed off), but the compiler should catch most
bugs (a void * variable being the exception).
And I already have a symbol_put_addr() separate from symbol_put(), so
I'd have to rethink the whole naming scheme, and it's a Friday 8)
Thanks,
Rusty.
