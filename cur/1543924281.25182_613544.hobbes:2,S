Data loss is never fun. I hope you didn't have anything important on the card.

I'm afraid the logs are of little help. They are just filled with noise from the file system. You also seem to prove the FAT code to give an invalid pointer (the oops in the first dmesg).
Can you reproduce this? To help you I need to see the errors given by the MMC layer. You should also try reproducing it without a tainted kernel (i.e. don't load ndiswrapper).
