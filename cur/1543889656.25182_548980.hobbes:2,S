The way new Intel features are being exposed in CPUID is kind of
changing.
Now we have different CPUID leafs for different kind of features with
each of them growing much slowly.
I mean, there is
monitor-mwait related features in CPUID 5
powermanagement features in CPUID 6 EAX, ECX
Perfmon features in CPUID 10
This does not fit well with the way we use the feature words in Linux.
Probably
it is better to have one new word for new Intel features and add bits
from all
CPUIDs as they come. I will take a look at all the other fields and try
for
a better solution than adding new words for different CPUIDs like above.
Thanks,
Venki
