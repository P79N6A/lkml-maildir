We tried that.
IIRC, the numbers mean different things for different versions of gcc, and 
I think using the parameters was very strongly discouraged by gcc 
developers. IOW, they were meant for gcc developers internal tuning 
efforts, not really for external people. Which means that using them would 
put us _more_ at the mercy of random compiler versions rather than less.
