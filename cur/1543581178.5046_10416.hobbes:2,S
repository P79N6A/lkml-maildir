s/impossible/unpleasant/.  ll_rw_blk blocks; it should be possible to have
a non blocking variant that does all of the setup in the caller's context.
Yes, I know that we can do it with a kernel thread, but that isn't as
clean and it significantly penalises small ios (hint: databases issue
*lots* of small random ios and a good chunk of large ios).

I'm willing to benchmark you on this.
