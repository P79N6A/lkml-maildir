The real question is when will Linux fully support multipath at the 
CAM/block layer? I'd really like to be able to throw, say, four HBAs 
into my system and have it use all of them simultaneously and not have 
to spend all sorts of time trying to set up all 200+ LUNs that I have 
available to me by hand.  Think 200 LUNs presented * 4 HBAs * 4 paths at 
the controller end per LUN.  That's quite a bit of setup to me.
