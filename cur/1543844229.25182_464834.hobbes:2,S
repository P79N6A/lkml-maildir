Absolutely. I guess the length of these threads is just fertile
ground for misunderstandings. Basically what Hiramatsu-san and
myself were discussing was just the mechanism for selecting/
forking in between the uninstrumented function and the instrumented
one.
So, to recap:
If you had 100,000 instrumentation points in the scheduler (obviously
a totally bogus number here ...) you'd have 2 functions:
1- one with no instrumentation at all, but with a 5byte filler such
   as the one presented by Hiramatsu-san.
2- one with the instrumentation.
Early in the proposal, the mechanics of switching in between "1" and "2"
seemed to be problematic, but I think with Hiramatsu-san's proposal
and, on the x86, djprobes, we've got it figured out.
Let me know if I'm not providing enough detail.
Thanks,
Karim
