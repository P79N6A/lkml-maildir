i have linux-2.2.11pre1 running with all the above patches applied,
except for lock-2.2.3.diff. And it's been working fine for a couple
of linux clients and an OpenStep/Mach client.
Without those patches i had a lot problems with locking, file stats
not updated properly, etc.. with: everything works swimmingly.
i havn't stress tested it though. But the clients so far have
survived server reboots without a problem.
PS: the nfsd-2.2.7-2.lockd.patch needs to be applied with -p2.. and i
added an extra 'exportfs -r' to /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs /after/ starting
nfsd. otherwise it didn't sync up properly for some reason.
