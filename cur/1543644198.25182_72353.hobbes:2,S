Could you post a list of requirements ? For example:
- kernel: futexes, per_cpu_areas
- toolchain: binutils version + RH-patches, gcc version
- glibc: 2.2.xxxx
etc...
Perhaps it is not so difficult, for example futexes are in -aa for 2.4,
Mandrake has gcc-3.2, etc...
Are you pushing hard for the infrastructure you need to get in standard
source trees (ie, changes to gcc, binutils...) ??
Thanks.
