I have gotten it to boot from those hard-drives and it 
has the same behavior:
  	Copying a large file to the same partition (>150MEG) 
  	causes the system to hang (no I/O - no input/output - 
  	nothing - complete freeze - like a primary resource 
  	is locked up or interrupts got completely & totally 
  	turned off in an ISR and its pending for something?
Only way to get out of this is to power-cycle the box!

MMmm.. I'd like to see that again without the rootfs-on-NFS.
What exactly do you mean when you say "it just hangs" ?
Everything (dead system)?
