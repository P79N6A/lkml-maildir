I don't know whether this is related, but one of the systems I admin
runs lots of applications that produce lots of temporary files, which
sounds like what you're seeing.
In my case, I've set the system up so all those temporary files are
created in /usr/tmp and have that set as a separate partition. It gets
cleaned every time the system boots, as part of the boot procedure is
to mke2fs that partition.
I can assure you that I've had no problems with that system since I
set that up - although in this case, the system is rebooted three or
four times a day by the students - some need to run it under WinNT as
the software they need to use has only been obtained in NT versions
(not my decision, I hasten to add), and others are being taught under
Linux...
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
