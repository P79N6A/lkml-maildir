It's actually worse than that.  If you set it to less than 4 on an x86
PC, it'll stamp over memory.  All is not lost though - it's fixed in:
http://www.kernel.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=44454bcdb90532b372c74e3546043d8a3a468939
I'd advise people _not_ to run -git2.  If they do and they see any
oddities, please don't bother reporting them unless you can reproduce
them with a later version or with this set to at least '4'.  This
problem can cause oopses in other parts of the kernel.
