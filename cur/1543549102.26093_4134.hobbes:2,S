ARCnet does ACK in hardware. Packets don't hit the wire until the 
destination has indicated that it's got a buffer available.
You really want to be able to reserve space on the queue before telling the
chip to accept another incoming packet - not just realise afterwards that 
you've screwed up.
Strictly speaking, this fact is irrelevant to the case in question, but if 
we're modifying the generic code for LAPB, we might as well think about other 
protocols which require similar treatment.
