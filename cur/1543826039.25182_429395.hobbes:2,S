Hi,
I have somewhat related problem as mentioned in my previous mail.
I was running one application on a linux-2.4.19-rmk7-pxa1 box with 16 MB RAM
and 16 MB flash. It was all working fine.
I am now trying to run the same application on a linux-2.6.13 box and
intermittently I get OOM-KILLER and killing of a required process. What has
changed between these two kernel version?
Please help.
Thanks and regards,
Abu.

0-order allocations means it cannot get even a single page of free
memory. You also see in the log the the OOM is kicking in. In other
words, totally out of memory.
You have two options, add more swap or add more memory. At the same
time it might be a good idea to try and monitor it to find out which
tasks are chewing away that much memory.
Cheers,
Jes
