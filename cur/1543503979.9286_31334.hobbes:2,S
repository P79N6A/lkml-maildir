Hello *!
I am wondering whether there is any support in linux for rescanning IDE
devices after booting it, for example as it is the case for SCSI devices. 
How difficult would it be to implement this? 
The point is that there are many notebooks available where you can plug in
either a floppy drive or an IDE CDROM.  For those notebooks, you either
have to have the CDROM drive plugged in when booting or specify hdx=crom. 
However, the first approach is uncomformtable and the second produces many
errors in case the CDROM is not in the computer and the kernel wants to
access it which is not beautiful either.
