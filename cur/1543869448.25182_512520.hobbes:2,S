That example touches back into user space, but doesnt involve MMU changes
or cache flushes, or tlb flushes, or floating point.
errno is thread specific if you use it but errno is as I said before
entirely a C library detail that you don't have to suffer if you don't
want to. Avoiding that saves a segment register load - which isn't too
costly but isn't free.
