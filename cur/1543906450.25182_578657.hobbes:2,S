Yup... it should probably be pointed out the reason the old kernel 
worked was nothing but pure dumb luck.  This was a GNU ld change which 
needed to be undone for klibc.  It's unfortunate that stock x86-64 
binaries leave as little of a null pointer range as they do, but that's 
life, unfortunately.  The other alternative is to map klibc just below 
the 2 GB point, which would also work, but the old way broke when the ld 
change went in.  As previously stated, klibc-1.4.35 or higher fixes this.
