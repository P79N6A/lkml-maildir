Actually, at that level, it *is* hard to distinguish.  I'm sure the RedHat
people have a *very* good idea of exactly how much PEBKAC cruft their bugzilla
gathers - and that's from users clued enough to bugzilla.
It might be interesting to use it to measure how many machines crap out because
of stray single-bit errors due to insufficient ECC on the hardware.
You can't use "a sudden upsurge" in reports as a good regression test, because
the vast majority of boxes are running distro kernels.  RHEL 4.0 just shipped a
2.6.9-34 kernel.  Ubuntu is on a 2.6.15.
And the people who are using kernel.org kernels aren't actually upgrading all
*that* fast either.  You'll get better info by looking at the lkml postings
that say '2.6.mumble regressed my foobar' - that will likely trigger before any
statistical tendency in bug reports gets noticed.
(Visit the bugzilla.mozilla.org, and note that neither 'most frequently
reported' nor 'reported today' give you a really good grasp on *current*
issues....)
