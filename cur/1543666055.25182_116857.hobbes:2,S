Well shoot, that was easy to "fix".  If you want to give it a try, set the 
#if 0 to #if 1.  Instead of _moving_ the decay to prevent high switch rate 
tasks from getting too much boost, you need to add it instead.  This may 
not be the right fix, but it works for me.  X still retains it's boost just 
fine.
