Redirecting all kernel messages to a fixed terminal (not the foreground
one) caused the kernel messages to be screwed up on such fixed vt.
Here it is my fix against both 2.2.x and 2.3.x:

The problem was that `x' is a macro that expands to something like
`vc_cons[currcons].d->vc_x' and so we must read x only _after_ setting
currcons to the kmsg_redirect_console.
