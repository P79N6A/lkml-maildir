This is not at all obvious from arch/i386/Kconfig.  Maybe we should
fix this?
					- Ted
Add an explanation that HIGHMEM64G is needed in order to get support
for the NX feature.
Remove an (incorrect) assertion that NOHIGHMEM is right for more
users, since most systems are coming with at least 1G of memory these
days, and even some laptops have up 4G of memory.
Finally, although the explanation of the 1G/3G split is correct, it is
not relevant to the NOHIGHMEM/HIGHMEM4G/HIGHMEM64G discussion, since
the each process will always see 3GB of virtual memory.  It also might
be something else depending on the setting of CONFIG_VMSPLIT_*.
