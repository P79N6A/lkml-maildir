I think it makes sense to merge patches 1-5 independently of this
patch.  The kernel interface is needed by iSER and NFS/RDMA, and
maintaining compatibility isn't a huge deal, so we can merge it now
(assuming it looks mergable).
On the other hand I think it would be good to let this userspace
interface cook a little more, say in -mm.
Anyone have any problems with that plan?
