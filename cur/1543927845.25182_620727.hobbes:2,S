My memory here is hazy, but I think this exists to rescue netconsole
in low-memory situations. This bit originated with Ingo, so maybe he
can recall.
Netpoll can process an arbitrary number of skbs inside a single
interrupt. Think sysrq-t at one packet per line or kgdboe where the
entire trace session can happen inside one very long interrupt.
Perhaps we can refine this to mark netpoll's skbs (perhaps with
->destructor?) and delete only skbs we own. As these are never passed
through any of the other route/xfrm/filter code, they should be safe
to delete even in irq context, yes?

Care to try the sysrq-t or OOM message tests?
