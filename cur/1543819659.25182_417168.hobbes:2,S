Hi!
I did suspend-to-ram yesterday on thinkpad x32, while docked in
docking station.... I do  not think I've done that before, because
docking only works for a few weeks. This morning I wake up okay,
unfortunately that thinkpad woke up as a portable, battery-backed-up
space heater :-(.
I can turn it on, it blinks keyboard leds and starts CPU fan, but
that's it. Tried removing battery and AC power for a few minutes, but
it made no difference. Tried pressing various keys during power on, no
reaction. Not even keyboard light reacts.
That machine may stil be covered by warranty (but I'm not sure if
that's good news, I primarily want my data back...)
