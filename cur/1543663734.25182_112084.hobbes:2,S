Note that we're dealing with a disk heavily busy since they're timing
out, but we're not necessairly cpu-busy at all. The cancellation is a
completely disk-less operation, it runs at cpu core speed. A simple
getevents with timeout + io_cancel will do the trick just fine. Sure,
this way the cancellation will have to run a bit of userspace code too,
but it shouldn't make that much difference in practice (at least unless
there's an heavy cpu or swap overload too that introduce an huge time
gap between the getevents timeout and the io_cancel to enter kernel).
Your API makes sense too, but it's just a different API and I'm not sure
if it worth to implement it at the light of the above considerations,
given we just have the io_cancel syscall. Also note that the
cancellation API makes sense even if we don't work in the disk-queue
layer, infact unless you've a 4G worthless I/O queue like in Andrew's
example, probably it won't make an huge difference to cancel the I/O in
the queue too, even if of course it would make perfect sense to do that
too.  it is especially difficult to cancel the I/O in the disk queue at
the moment because we can't make sure what is our request and what is
somebody else request. Same goes for your cancellation API, it would be
difficult to cancel it. Everything in the queue is asynchronous and not
everybody will wait on its stuff immediatly.

again, we're not necessairly swapped out, the aio api should take care
of the I/O congestions, not necessairly of the VM and cpu congestions.
And for the I/O congestions it looks sane to me even if it will have to
pass through userspace, but passing through userspace may be an
advantage some time (so you can choose how much to cancel or whatever).

Sure I understood your point.

Not sure how much you can save, disconnects shouldn't be so frequent and
filling the cache anyways may make sense specially for http, and the
timeouts are quite long, by the time the network timeout trigger likely
the I/O just completed since a long time, and it wouldn't be easy to
synchronize the network timeout with the request submit-time-timeout. I
believe cancellation matters for interactive applications, and http and
ftp aren't interactive, I mean, there's not a throughput requirement for
http/ftp, nor a frame rate to keep up with, if flash or java takes
longer to load because your network is slower, you'll just wait longer etc..
