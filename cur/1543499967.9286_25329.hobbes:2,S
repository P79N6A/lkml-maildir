Linux Gods,
The FENRIS (nwfs) source code for 1.4.2 can be downloaded from
207.109.151.240.  Please refer to the release notes attached to this email
for info on what got fixed.  Special thanks to Alan Cox for his help with
the GNU compiler issues (and other issues).  We will be posting one
additional release later this week after we have regression tested the GNU
compiler fixes (nwfs-1.4.3).  Next week, mirroring support will be posted to
the site in nwfs-1.4.4.
