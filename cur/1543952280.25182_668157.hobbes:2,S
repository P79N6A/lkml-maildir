It is not misleading in the same way.  It's clear that going to look at the
kernel source is not the place to find the root of the problem.

For me and you, I agree.  I think the common case is that there is no admin
prepared to do any such thing, but just someone expecting a reboot to fix
things and preferring that a failing system reboot itself in the middle of
the night rather than wedge.

Many production systems probably set panic_on_oops.  Having the init panic
behavior keyed on that seems fine to me.  I just don't like the "kernel bug
at this source line" output when it's not true.
Thanks,
