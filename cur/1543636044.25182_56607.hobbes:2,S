This is just fantastic. I'm glad to see someone ran with the ideas of
patchless kernel debuggers as described in the Adeos paper and the likes.
There are definitely interfacing opportunities with the Adeos work
that's already been done using a kernel patch. Having both Adeos
as a kernel patch and as a patchless nanokernel is now really within
our reach.
Kudos to Miguel :)
