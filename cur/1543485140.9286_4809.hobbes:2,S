I am working on updated networking manpages for Linux 2.2. LPF is not 
covered (yet?) though, but a lot of other things are already. Snapshots
(not finished yet and probably with some bugs) are available from
ftp.muc.de:/people/ak/netman*. Comments are welcome of course, it is still
work in process.
I am not sure if I should document LPF at all - people will usually
use it through the libbpf library and that is already well documented 
(and the Linux extension like arbitary per socket filters are straight forward)
One problem is that the standard VJ BPF bytecodes don't support variable
length headers well, which makes them pretty much useless for IPv6 and
most other modern protocols - I hope any necessarry any changes Linux will 
make here will appear in the LBL reference BPF implementation.
