Subject: [PATCH 7/7] Call tasklet less frequently
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Schedule load balance tasklet less frequently
We schedule the tasklet before this patch always with the value in
sd->interval. However, if the queue is busy then it is sufficient
to schedule the tasklet with sd->interval*busy_factor.
So we modify the calculation of the next time to balance by taking
the interval added to last_balance again. This is only the
right value if the idle/busy situation continues as is.
There are two potential trouble spots:
- If the queue was idle and now gets busy then we call rebalance
  early. However, that is not a problem because we will then use
  the longer interval for the next period.
- If the queue was busy and becomes idle then we potentially
  wait too long before rebalancing. However, when the task
  goes idle then idle_balance is called. We add another calculation
  of the next balance time based on sd->interval in idle_balance
  so that we will rebalance soon.
