Yeah ok, so the address/id/local part is still there. As is much of the API
to query those attributes.

IMHO, yes. Mostly because we both have very similar basic requirements there
and it seems a waste to have duplicated code (even if it's not a huge
amount). Future projects wanting to query basic node information from the
kernel could have simply used that API without having to further duplicate
code too. That said, I'm not sure it has to be done *now*
Was there anything in my comments which made going forward with that
approach difficult for dlm?

Without the dlm specifics, right? It's perfectly fine with me if dlm has a
couple more attributes that it wants on a node object - OCFS2 simply won't
query them.
