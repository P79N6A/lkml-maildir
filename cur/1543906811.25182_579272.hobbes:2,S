Hi Andrew,
I just went through my mailbox and found a bunch of old patches 
that never got any comments (or at the very least never got applied).
I would hate to see the work I did creating them go to waste, so 
I'm going to resend them all to you and Cc all the original 
recipients and then I hope that you'll give them a (hopefully 
temporary) home in -mm :-)
They are all pretty trivial and shouldn't take you long to review.
Kind regards,
  Jesper Juhl <jesper.juhl@gmail.com>
