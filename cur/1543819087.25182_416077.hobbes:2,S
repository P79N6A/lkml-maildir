Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Open IPMI BT overflow
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I was looking into random driver code and found a suspicious looking 
memcpy() in drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_bt_sm.c on 2.6.17-rc1:
	if ((size < 2) || (size > IPMI_MAX_MSG_LENGTH))
		return -1;
	...
	memcpy(bt->write_data + 3, data + 1, size - 1);
where sizeof bt->write_data is IPMI_MAX_MSG_LENGTH. It looks like the 
memcpy would overflow by 2 bytes if size == IPMI_MAX_MSG_LENGTH. A patch 
attached to limit size to (IPMI_MAX_LENGTH - 2). I'm unfamiliar with the 
driver and interface so it's very possible I'm wrong.
