How about:
-				WARN("no space between function name and open parenthesis '('\n" . $herecurr);
+				WARN("there should be no space between function name and open parenthesis '('\n" . $herecurr);
The original phrasing can be interpreted like "there is no space between ..." and the correct
interpretation should be "there should be no space between ..."
