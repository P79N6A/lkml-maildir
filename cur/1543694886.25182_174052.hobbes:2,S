some page was requested, (probably via a pointer
dereference, read or write), which led to a page
fault, which in turn could not be satisfied by
loading/providing the requested page, because it
simply isn't there (usually wrong address)

some pointer (value = NULL) was dereferenced, which
should be considered an error, this caused the oops
which (probably) follows those lines (reg/stackdump)
	int *test = NULL;
	int v = test[0];	// bad!
