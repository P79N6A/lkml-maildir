No kidding.  That is one of the advantages of UTP.  In a scenario
where the cables are NOT dangling or in a position to have 1000
pound steel plates dropped on them, this advantage is
meaningless however, and coax is just as good.  Coax is more
unlikely to get broken than UTP as well.  The cable is thick and
strong.  In a home environment, this is good enough for most
cases, ESPECIALLY cheap quick solutions.  If someone were wiring
their house with network cable, I would heavily recommend going
with UTP however, and forking for the hub.  It is much more
worth it in the long run to go for UTP, but not all situations
demand forking out the extra cost.  A simple 2 machine network,
or even a simple 3 machine network is a good example.  It really
depends on the customers usage and other needs though.

Yes, it can, but the scenarios that you are describing sound more
"business" networkish to me.  It's not like all kinds of people
are out there with 20 computers networked in their houses with
all this space between machines...  We're talking SIMPLE NETWORK
in the home.  UTP is not needed.

That I will strongly agree with.  Again though, it really truely
depends on the exact scenario.  If someone came to me to set
up either a home or business network, I would want to see the
site itself, and know how much they want to spend.  I'd make some
recommendations based on that.  I'd likely recommend that they
got UTP if there were more than 2 machines, for the advantages
that UTP does have, but I'd also give them a price for coax too,
and let them decide.  Most 2-3 user home networks would likely go
with the coax I believe.
