The problem is that that removes the
	cur_timer->mark_offset();
	do_timer(regs);
in time.  If this were accompanied by code in the actual interrupt path that 
grabbed the offset info and the above was deferred to the irq thread I think it 
would be much better.
Something like:
	cur_timer->get_offset_info();
in the interrupt path and then, in the thread:
	cur_timer->apply_offset_info();
In the non-RT system we would just do:
	cur_timer->get_offset_info();
	cur_timer->apply_offset_info();
I think then we should let the apply code do the do_timer(regs) call as well as 
it is already messing with jiffies to correct for lost ticks.  An interesting 
point here is what to actually pass for "regs".  I suspect we would like the 
get_offset code to grab the relevant part of regs as well.  But then, we only 
really use regs in the accounting path which is else where on SMP machines.
This then bubbles up into a change in the common code (do_timer()) but we 
already have that.
I could code this up if you like.  Might want to get John Stultz's two cents on 
all this.
A related change I made in the HRT SMP code is to not use the local apic timers 
to kick off the accounting and run_timers code, but to define a new IPI.  In my 
current HRT code I send an IPI to all but self right after the jiffies update 
(calling the current cpus accounting code right after the IPI request).  I 
suspect the right thing to do here is to make that an IPI to all cpus, including 
self.  The reason for this change is to get the run_timers code to run as close 
to the jiffies update as possible.  This is required to get reasonable high res 
timers.
