The problem for must users of earlier versions of linux is the definition of
safe changed.  Safe now means you can remove the module without crashing
the kernel.  Safe used to mean that nothing could possible be using the code.
Sort of like difference between NFS hard and soft mount.
A bigger issue is that there seems to be a whole set of smaller distro's and
people who write their own startup scripts that became addicted to the old behaviour.
I wish all the distro's would get rid of explicit modprobe and rmmod's in startup
scripts.
