IMHO it was a mistake to make this change in FC2.

Nobody guarantees that the TSC is clocked at the same rate per CPU and
several power management schemes break it. I see it break on my Thinkpad
600 and its one reason I have to replace the FC kernel with a 2.6-ac
kernel on that system.
Is gettimeofday supposed to return the right value or be fast ?
