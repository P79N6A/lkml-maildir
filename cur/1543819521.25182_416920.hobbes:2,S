This might be problematic, since there is a shared receive-queue in
the kernel netlink message might get processed in the context of
a different process. I didn't find any spots where ISCSI passes
pointers over netlink, can you point me to it?
Besides that, netlink protocols should use fixed size architecture
independant types, so u64 would be the best choice for pointers.
