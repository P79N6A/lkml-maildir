Events notification only helps while you've got someone around to listen
to the events.  If you reboot (or even just log out?  I don't know),
then when you come back the only completely reliable way to find out
what's changed may be to re-read everything.
So I'd think that far more important and basic than events notification
would be ways to reliably tell when a file have changed by looking just
at the attributes.
You can just use everything that "stat" gives you and figure that if a
file is still at the same path, with the same ctime, mtime, size,
permissions, owner, inode number, etc., then it's probably the same
file.
If that's not enough, then maybe you want a change attribute (that's
guaranteed to change even when changes happen within less than the
granularity of ctime), and generation number (that's bumped whenever an
inode number is reused).
