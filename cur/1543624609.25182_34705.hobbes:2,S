Your "prep" patch for discontigmem seems pretty sane... but it's also a 
[relatively] big patch involving a pretty key piece of code.
I wonder if you could split the memalloc-setup patch into multiple 
steps, eventually arriving at your goal?
IMO it would be better to split up the memalloc-setup patch, apply it to 
2.5.x initially...
(sorry, no comments on your actual discontigmem patch :))
