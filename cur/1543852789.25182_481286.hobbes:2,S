No, it will not. I'm really sorry, mainline was already fixed at
2.6.17-rc5 time by that commit:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=1a2acc9e9214699a99389e323e6686e9e0e2ca67
But for some reason handhelds.org kernel tree's block/genhd.c file was
unsynchronized with mainline. I've revealed that only after my patch was
removed and I've started to investigate SCSI oops issue triggered by my
patch.
Resume: mainline do not need my patch, handhelds.org's kernel should be
synchronized with mainline.
