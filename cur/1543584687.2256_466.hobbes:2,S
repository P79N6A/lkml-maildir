If reverse mapping means bus_to_virt(), then I would suggest not to
provide it since it is a confusing interface. OTOH, only a few drivers
need or want to retrieve the virtual address that lead to some bus dma
address and they should check that this virtual address is still valid
prior to using it. As I wrote, some trivial hashed list can be used by
such drivers (as sym* do).

I wanted the code as short as possible since the driver code is already
very large. On the other hand there are bunches of #ifdef to deal with all
still alive kernel versions. As a result, the code may well not be general
nor clean enough to be moved to the kernel. Just what it actually does is 
fairly simple.

Hmmm... 'reusable' implies 'usable'...
Does 'usable' apply to Java applications ? :-)
