It's simple -- we want the kernel to have its serial console running at
115200, and we don't want to have to change speeds to talk to the
bootloader.  Some boot processes, particularaly fsck, can be *REALLY*
verbose on screwed up systems.  I've seen systems take hours to run fsck,
even on small filesystems, simply because they were blocking on a 9600 bps
console.
