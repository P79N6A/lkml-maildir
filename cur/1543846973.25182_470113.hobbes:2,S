No. To my knowledge Tim Chen hasn't tried __read_mostly, and I have not
attempted to replicate the test case. (I only have a uniprocessor
machine.) Core 2 machines have a cache line size of 64 bytes, but Tim
Chen is likely using a different kernel/.config than I am so my objdump
isn't definitive.
Tim, perhaps you can try the __read_mostly marking as Andrew suggests?
