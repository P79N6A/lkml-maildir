I'm pretty sure __LP64__ is the standard compiler defined macro
for 64-bit builds on most architectures.

IIRC, the problem with __LP64__ is it wasn't visible to the CONFIG
tool chains and dependencies. I believe that's fixed now and parisc
could deprecate use of CONFIG_64BIT if there is a strong preference
for __LP64__.

This shouldn't be exported to user space. Is that what you meant?
PA-RISC user space can currently only be 32-bit anyway.
So a 64-bit kernel will have to take that into consideration.
