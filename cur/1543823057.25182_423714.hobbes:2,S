Good point.

Not quite as simple.  My version is does two things.  First, it
accepts "ki" and second, it does not accept "k".  The latter is
important, because "k" means 1000, not 1024.
There are existing users that still use the historical interpretation,
so I guess we need both variants.

Doesn't work here.  Every single error gives a different message.  Oh
well, let's go for the longer function.

You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks
occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a
speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.
