The persistent interface naming rules of udev, at least up to 0.114-2 
(current debian unstable), seem to be easily confused if the driver names 
change for the same MAC address. This issue seems not to be b43 specific, 
it happens with zd1211rw --> zd1211rw_mac80211 (this one won't show up in 
mainline kernels), prism54 --> p54pci/ p54usb, out-of-tree RaLink legacy/ 
serialmonkey (which ignore interface renames through udev completely) --> 
rt2x00 just as well and I assume that it might also affect sk98lin --> 
skge/ sky and the upcomming e1000 --> e1000e transitions and similar 
situations.

It is of course confusing to the user and might affect remote updates, but 
it's also easily fixed by removing the generated MAC address mappings and 
letting udev generate new ones (+ post processing, if needed) during the 
next boot.
