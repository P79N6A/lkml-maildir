Sigh.
I think you are confusing references and pointers. By definition
you cannot "store a reference"; however, you can "dereference"
an object and store a pointer to it.
The C programming language conflates these two different ideas;
that is why they seem to be "the same thing" to you.

Which part isn't true?
