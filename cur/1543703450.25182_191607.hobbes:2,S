Its from the kernel afaik.  It calls modprobe, fails, and then prints
its own custom message.  He basically just have something that tries
to load a module with alias 'digest_null', but there is no such module,
so fails.
I have the same thing when I open gnome-mixer:
--
request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- sound-slot-1. error = 256
--
as I only have one sound card ...
