This patch seems totally buggy.
mprotect() can cover _multiple_ mappings, and this one only checks the 
very first one, as far as I can tell.
The place to do this is where we do the "security_file_mprotect()", not 
where you did it. 
Ie something like this instead. Totally untested, but at least it compiles 
with current -git (unlike Uli's version - needs <linux/mount.h>)
