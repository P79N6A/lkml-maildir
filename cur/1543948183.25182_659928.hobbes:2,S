I think I might have seen this problem but it didn't cause a oops for
me, just that the radio program would hang waiting for the ioctl syscall
to return.  I did tried looking for a new radio program that used the
V4L2 API but couldn't find one.  I'll have a more in-depth look at the
bttv driver when I get home tonight.
