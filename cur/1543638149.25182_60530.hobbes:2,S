The GNU coding standards make some very sensible comments on this
subject. A very good read;
  
http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_24.html
I find it interesting that a large quantity of the kernel and C
library source code I have come across recently has no comments (with
the exception of the O(1) scheduler, very nice).  At the very least, I
think every function should have a comment listing all of its input
variables and what they mean, along with a rough idea of what the
function does, and what it returns, along with any assumptions.  It
would make the code a *lot* easier for programmers with less than guru
levels of knowledge to understand and hack on.
