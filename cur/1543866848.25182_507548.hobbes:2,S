I'd like to have that on ppc as well, so I'd rather keep it in drivers/
I agree that it doesn't need to be a module. If you can load modules,
then you can load the full ohci driver. Thus, if it's an early thingy
initialized by arch, it can export a special "takeover" hook that the
proper ohci module can then call to override it (important if we start
having an irq handler).
Andi, also, how do you deal with iommu ? Not at all ? :-)
