No, I don't think that's what it is doing at all. Quite the reverse, in
fact.
Look:

This means that "io" was zero, but more importantly, it means that "len"
was zero too.

It _is_ that simple, but the code should check for "len" being zero, ie
the fix looks like it should be just a simple
	if (!len)
		return;
and that should fix it.

Yes, and clearly they don't have "len == 0".

I would suggest:
 - "len == 0"		=>  obviously disabled (both IO and memory)
 - "end < base"		=>  obviously disabled due to overflow crap
 - "end >= 0x10003"	=>  IO disabled (yeah, non-x86 can have IO above
			    that range in PCI, but I think it's undefined
			    behaviour)
all three should be cases of "obviously we can't validly have such a
resource", and the "len == 0" case should trivially fix the case that
CarlosRomero saw.
