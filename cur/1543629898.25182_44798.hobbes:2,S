Please push it higher level than that. Load the taskfile as a set in
each method. Remember its 1 potentially paired instruction to do an MMIO
write, its a whole mess of synchronziation and stalls to do a function 
pointer.

Pass  dev->taskfile_load() a struct at least for the common paths. Make the
PIO block transfers also single callbacks for each block not word.
