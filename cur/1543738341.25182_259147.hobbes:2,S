I hope that *nothing* will be lost.  We (I) aim to still offer
users/admins named groupings of CPUs and memory.  They may not be called
cpusets, in favor of names like classes or domains, but they will
*still* be named groupings of CPUs and memory.  I further aim to not
change your API significantly.  I really like the filesystem API you
came up with to interact with cpusets from userspace.  I'd like to
incorporate this into CKRM's filesystem API (called rcfs) with minimal
changes.  I really like the exclusive cpusets you describe.  You tried
to implement them with some kernel exclusivity (your vitamin
precursors), while I'd like to see the kernel offer real exclusivity. 
This shouldn't affect your customers because real exclusivity will
*still* be offered.  I also aim to support what seems like a large
portion of your non-exclusive cpusets through nested, hierarchical
sched_domains.  And I hope to do all of this with less overhead.
Now, I'm certainly not saying my patch provides all these things now.  I
am saying that I believe the approach/model I'm using could do all these
things with some further work.

Andrew is da man.  Sometimes da man works with you, sometimes da man
works against you.  As the French say, c'est la vie.
I think we can figure out how to merge cpusets into CKRM's framework,
with minimal changes to both the cpusets API & functionality without
slipping that *too* much.  End of the year isn't unreasonable....

You asked for it!!! ;)
