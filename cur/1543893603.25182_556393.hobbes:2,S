Hmm.  I wonder how to *enable* it in the first place.. ;)
e_powersaver.ko and acpi_cpufreq gives "No such device"

The thing is that I didn't even try to test it WITHOUT the fan.
It makes no difference in themperature (lm_sensors shows 40
degrees celsius under continious run of `openssl speed' with
fan, and 39 degrees without fan but with larger headstick).
But all the testing are done with the original headstick+fan
as provided by VIA.
