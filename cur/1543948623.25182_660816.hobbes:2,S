Doing ++ on a u32 _is_ atomic wrt interrupts on x86 and probably lots of
other architectures, so we're OK using unsigned there.  But on some other
architectures ++ on u32 is not atomic wrt interrutps, so they should use
atomic_t or some other arch-specific mechanism.
And guess what?  It's already all been done: local_t.
