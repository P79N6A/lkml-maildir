Sent this out a few days ago, haven't seen it in the list yet (sent here
or on any of the web archives). Figured the attachments were probably
too large, so I bzip'd them.
Hello,
I was trying to get some stuff working, and switched my Abit VP6
MultiProcessor Specification from 1.4 to 1.1, hoping that might clean
some stuff up. Looked good for a bit, but left it running overnight and
came back to this. Also found a crash that 1.4 put in, that I never saw
before.
Boot messages say 2.6.8, but its definitely 2.6.9-rc3
