For Intel servers, there is some help in 2.4.  It is now included within
the OpenIPMI driver.
It saves the panic info into a firmware log.
See 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/openipmi/
 and 
http://panicsel.sf.net
(more info, plus a 'showsel' utility to view the firmware log).
The parameter to save this isn't turned on by default in OpenIPMI, but
it is there in 2.4 kernels (CONFIG_IPMI_PANIC_EVENT).

On the other hand, if like me you use a text-based console almost
exclusively,
then the best course of action is probably to buy a real serial
terminal, (or
several :-) ), and configure one of them as the console.  Then you can
basically ignore the VGA display completely.
