I don't think so. With ticket spinlocks and such, that just looks like it 
is destine to crash. Also, spinlocks disable preemption, and we would need 
to enable it again otherwise we have a dangling preempt_disable.

We could have a percpu for single data and still use the lock. Keep the 
method of the IPI handler signaling to the caller that they copied it to 
their stack. Then the caller could release the lock.
We can keep this only for the non wait case. Most users set the wait bit, 
so it will only slow down the non waiters.
Of course this will only work with the single cpu function callers. I 
think the all cpu function callers still need to alloc.
