I though we were talking about
	static data_used_by_callbacks;
	...
	register_foo(&stuff_with_callbacks);
	...
	unregister_foo(&stuff_with_callbacks);
	make_unusable(&data_used_by_callbacks)
	...
	/* oops, we just got a callback */
("data_used_by_callbacks" could be a pointer to kmalloc'ed
memory, etc.)
This kind of problem seems to be understood well enough.
But maybe you mean something else ?
