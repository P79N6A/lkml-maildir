Subject: Something odd with 2.4.0-test4 - pipes or suid/sgid broken ?

There is something strange going on with 2.4.0-test4. It did not happen
with -test3.
I run a local INN news server, feeding a couple of mailing lists into it.
Has worked fine for several years. It works by using procmail to deliver
mail; procmail delivers it to a pipe that consists of a home-written
program that sets up the "Newsgroups:" etc. headers, and the rnews
program from INN.
Since I upgraded to 2.4.0-test4, this has stopped working. By adding a
couple of "tee" commands to the pipe, I know that it fails at the end
of the pipe - when trying to run rnews. There is no error message logged
anywhere; nothing in the INN logs show any trace of rnews running at
all. 
rnews is set to owner/group=uucp/news, and perms r-s--x--x . Apart
from the change to allow ordinary users to run rnews, this is a pretty
stock Red Hat 6.2 system - except that I use reiserfs.
Guess I'm back to -test3 so I can at least be sure to see the responses 
I get to this message :-)
Any ideas ?
