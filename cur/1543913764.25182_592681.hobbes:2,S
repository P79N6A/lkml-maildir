I'm happy to see this go too, but please add the necessary
export to arch/sparc64/kernel/sparc64_ksyms.S so that the
solaris system call table reference in
arch/sparc64/solaris/systbls.S can be satisfied.
This keeps coming up, and people keep missing the reference
in the solaris compatibility module.
