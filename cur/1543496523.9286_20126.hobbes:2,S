Subject: Sound in 2.3 Kernels (ALSA/EsounD Daemon)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I don't remember where I saw it, whether it was here in the kernel mailing 
list, or at the ALSA homepage, but I read that ALSA was going to be 
incorporated in the 2.3 kernel.  That is a good start.
I'd like to propose an idea, I don't know how feasible it is, but it's worth 
a shot.  The EsounD daemon is an excellent program for allowing multiple 
programs to share the /dev/dsp device.  It's great being able to hear Licq 
telling me I have a message while playing MP3 files in X11Amp.
However, the problem is that not all programs work with it, even using the 
esddsp script to preload the libraries.  Since (IMO) this is a very useful 
feature, why not implement it in the kernel?  That way there would be no 
library loading necessary, hopefully improving compatibility.  It might also 
encourage application developers to port their applications to use the new 
code.
So, what say you kernel/sound experts?  I realize that it will make the 
kernel larger, but I already have to do a "make bzImage" to make my kernel 
anyway (I have lots of hardware, and I hate modules).
Would this be possible, or am I dreaming here?
Thanks,
Joe
