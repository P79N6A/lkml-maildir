All the obvious stuff like bios is correct :)
The 2.4 kernel works fine; 4 cpus detected and displayed in /proc/cpuinfo.
2.5 has never worked properly yet with this m/b; A shame since it's asus 
  top of the range dual xeon server board, the PR-DLS.
The 3 io-apics are indeed strange. I'm hoping Andrew Grover might have 
some ideas...?
