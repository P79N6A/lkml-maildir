Well we already have controls for strategic unfairness: the "read passovers"
thing.  It sets a finite limit on the number of times which a request can
be walked past by the merging algorithm.   Once that counter has
expired, the request becomes effectively a merging barrier and it will
propagate to the head of the queue as fast as the disk can retire the
reads.
I don't have a problem if the `read latency' tunable (and this
algorithm) cause a single thread to hog the disk head across
multiple successive readahead windows.  That's probably a good thing,
and it's tunable.
But it seems to not be working right.
And there's no userspace tunable at this time.

I assume that there's a difference in the way in which the generic layer
treats queueing for IDE devices.  In 2.4, IDE devices are `head active',
so the request at the head of the queue is under I/O.  But SCSI isn't
head-active.  Requests get removed from the head of the queue prior to
being serviced.  At least, that's how I think it goes.  I also believe that
the 2.4 elevator does not look at the active request at the head when making
merging decisions.
But in 2.5, head-activeness went away and as far as I know, IDE and SCSI are
treated the same.  Odd.
