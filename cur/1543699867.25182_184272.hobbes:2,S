This really isn't appropriate. The
	With PCI-E, config space accessed through memory. Each device gets
	its own 4k memory mapped config, total 256M for all devices.
thing _really_ does not work on x86, since 256M of IO mapping is _way_ way
too much.
You _really_ need to allocate a FIXMAP entry (just one), and then use
	set_fixmap_nocache(FIX_PCIEXPRESS, phys);
to set it up for each device.
That's actually going to be a lot simpler than what you do now.
