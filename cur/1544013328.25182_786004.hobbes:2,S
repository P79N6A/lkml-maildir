this was just a temporary hack to work around a mild regression in -git 
that i'm sure will be sorted out in short order (if it has not been 
already).
CONFIG_BROKEN is a much different category: it blacklists ridiculously 
stale or mortally broken features/drivers, as a last warning before they 
get removed for good. I dont use it in such temporary, not-for-upstream 
testing hacks (even though the end result is obviously the same as 
'depends on 0') - i didnt even have time to properly report the build 
breakage.
