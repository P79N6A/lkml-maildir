Subject: [PATCH] Fix kmem_cache_free performance regression in slab
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/29/303

The database performance group have found that half the cycles spent
in kmem_cache_free are spent in this one call to BUG_ON.  Moving it
into the CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG-only function cache_free_debugcheck() is a
performance win of almost 0.5% on their particular benchmark.
The call was added as part of commit ddc2e812d592457747c4367fb73edcaa8e1e49ff
with the comment that "overhead should be minimal".  It may have been
minimal at the time, but it isn't now.

operating system, but compare it to ours.  We can't possibly take such
a retrograde step."
