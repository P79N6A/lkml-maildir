I'm sorry, I'm not seeing get_cycles used in /dev/random (although they
do make a direct call to rdtsc if its available - which is fine, since
the TSCs I deal with daily just give random values anyway :). So I don't
believe that is a concern.  
Additionally, the hangcheck timer code does calculate time (although,
not system time) using get_cycles, and this gives them a good
abstraction so the right thing happens on the right box. 
Let me know if you have any other concerns.
thanks
