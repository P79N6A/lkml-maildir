Hi all,
The Update Version patchset is a set of patches which include only fatal
compile/runtime bug fixes and security updates for the current kernel
version.  This patch set can be used in production environments for those
who wish to run 2.4.23, but do not use vendor kernels and at the same time
require patches which add to the stability of the current release kernel
version.  This is a patch set only, it does not include kernel source.
Current version is 2.4.23-uv1 and contains many patches pulled from bit keeper.
The complete URL to the patch set is
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/current-updates/linux-2.4.23-updates.patch
Individual patches can be viewed and downloaded from
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/current-updates/
This patch set only contains and will only contain security updates and
fixes for the latest kernel version.  Each individual patch contains text
WRT the patch itself and the creator of the patch, I will try to keep doing
that as standard reference for the complete collection.
Please send bug reports to jbourne@hardrock.org and CC
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org.
