For this one, I see a third way:
#define lock_super(sb) do {		\
	get_fs_excl();			\
	mutex_lock(&(sb)->s_lock);	\
} while (0)
It does have the disadvantage that you can pass *anything* that has
an s_lock field in ... but I don't think that's a very likely thing
to happen.
Or you could use _sb as the local variable, since it's a reserved
identifier.
