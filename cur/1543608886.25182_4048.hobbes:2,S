An interesting idea. I didn't expect it to change anything - it doesn't 
look as if it's examining hardware at the critical moment, but then 
who's going to say the printed info appears on the terminal before it 
progresses to the next statement?
Well it went on and hung in ISAPnP checking.
I deleted the syslinux messages and got even further.
It sounds less bizarre now - it seems it can't scroll, but what next?
It's found the internal sound card and attached (bizarre - why does 
that word keep coming up) internal modem attached to the sound card.
