Although you can't do that at the moment, at least you
can
play with the loop offset when mounting your file as a
loopback to access a given partition. I think it would
be
simpler to write a small prog that will seek on your
file to
read the MBR and extended partitions and returns a
list
of offsets for all the partitions so that you can
mount them.
(man 8 mount for more info).
