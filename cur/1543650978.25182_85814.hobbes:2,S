Hija,
is there any good documentation around how to tweak Linux' arp caching
behaviour? I've been fooling around with parameters in 
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/default but couldn't get it to keep hardware
addresses valid for a longer period of time than a few seconds.
I'd like to avoid caching hardware addresses in userspace and I need
my entries to be far longer reachable without making them permanent.
Any pointers would be greatly appreactiated.
