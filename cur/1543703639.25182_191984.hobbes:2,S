Subject: 2.6.1: media change check fails for busy unplugged device

If we unplug busy device (consider mounted USB stick) media change check 
always returns true (no media change happened). It happens because
- device state is set to SDEV_DEL and scsi_prep_fn silently kills any request 
including TEST_UNIT_READY sent by sd_media_changed without propagating any 
information back to caller
- sdev->online still remains TRUE
so nothing ever tells sd_media_changed that device is gone.
this effectively prevents supermount from noticing that it needs remount 
subfs.
What is the right place to catch those deleted device? For now I add this as 
part of supermount patch, but it looks too ugly (and in the wrong place):
