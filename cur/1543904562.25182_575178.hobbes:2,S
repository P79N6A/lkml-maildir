Even if I want to SUSPEND* to <something> I can't on my Dell Precision 530 boxes , 
SCSI is broken with suspend therefore all these boxes have the whole SUSPEND* off, 
all I need is ACPI.
So why you think I want to have this all enabled by default now ? 
Just to bloat the kernel with something doesn't even work for me ?
And I don't get from where you have the '99%' thing ?

But in this case some config / new config is better.
I do not need ACPI to SUSPEND but to make the box work properly.
Ohh and isn't better to make 'ACPI_PROCESSOR  select SUSPEND_SMP and HOTPLUG_CPU if X86 && SMP' ?
...
config ACPI_PROCESSOR
        tristate "Processor"
        default y
        help
          This driver installs ACPI as the idle handler for Linux, and uses
          ACPI C2 and C3 processor states to save power, on systems that
          support it.  It is required by several flavors of cpufreq
          Performance-state drivers.
...
Is more logical for me to do it here but I may be wrong.
