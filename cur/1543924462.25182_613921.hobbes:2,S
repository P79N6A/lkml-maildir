I'm afraid some people do not realize a whit about what they do.
So at least we could let kbuild warn about it.
Something like this:
$ export CFLAGS=-O3
$ make AFLAGS=-fisk
Makefile:540: "Appending $AFLAGS (-fisk) from command line to kernel defined $AFLAGS"
Makefile:544: "Appending $CFLAGS (-O3) from environment to kernel defined $CFLAGS"
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/utsrelease.h
  CC      arch/x86/kernel/asm-offsets.s
  GEN     include/asm-x86/asm-offsets.h
  CALL    scripts/checksyscalls.sh
  CC      scripts/mod/empty.o
This patch is needed to do so.
If one does a make O=... build then they will see the warning(s) twice.
