Because I'm dealing with real users who want it to work with real product 
and because I work for a vendor 8). Also because I need this to work on 2.4.x
eventually. I'm assuming the small IDE changes won't make 2.6.9 since Linus
is now close to a 2.6.9 proper. I've sent the IDE changes before, you didn't
pass them on to Linus so I'm now taking the neccessary alternative steps in
the short term.

Do we need it given the existing iop hooks ?

Thats definitely the right approach although

Actually its a few more - the size check needs fixing
But this is really irrelevant, they aren't there today, they are not there
in 2.4.x, Linus isnt likely to take them in time for 2.6.9.

The rmmod is no big deal, its brilliant for debug but I know of no
hotswappable it8212 setup.

Well I've submitted various IDE changes, when they appear great, until then
the rest of the universe would like to use their IDE controller and its becoming
present as the secondary controller on some mainboards. This patch (plus
any testing bugs I find) solves the end user problem neatly.
