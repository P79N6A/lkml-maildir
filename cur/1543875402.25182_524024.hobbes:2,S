Ummm...  I've just realised that your statement here is ambiguous.  When you
say "aren't required to", do you mean "aren't necessary to" or do you mean
"don't have to"?  Isn't English a fun language?
Anyway, what I meant is that mb() and co. as they stand _must_ do everything
smp_mb() and co do respectively, _in_ _addition_ to other side effects.
	mb() implies smp_mb()
	rmb() implies smp_rmb()
	wmb() implies smp_wmb()
	...
