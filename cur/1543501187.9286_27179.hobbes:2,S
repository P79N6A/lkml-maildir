Worthies of the Linux Kernel List:
I need to create a rather large region of shared memory -- on the order of 50MB.
More specifically, I need a contiguous region of memory that can be mapped into
multiple processes (serially, not simultaneously) on a uniprocessor system and
persist beyond any particular process.
It appears that there is a limit on System V style shared memory segments of
about 4MB, so that method is out.
Memory mapping a file seems to involve a lot of gratuitous (for our application)
file synchronization, so that method is out.
I was pretty content with a variation on the 'scullv' device presented by
Alessandro Rubini in his book "Linux Device Drivers", but the 2.2 kernel has
obsoleted that driver. Since significant work will be needed to make our current
driver work under 2.2, I'm revisiting the question.
Is there a Right Way to do this with the 2.2 kernel?
Thanks.
PS: Please let me know if there is a more appropriate list for questions of this
sort.
