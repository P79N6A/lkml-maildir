The *contents of the source of the tree itself* are indeed GPL, and I doubt that
anybody argues otherwise.  The actual method(s) used to *STORE* said contents
are *NOT* GPL - if you argue that the fact of storing the source in a BK tree
renders the BK itself GPL, then we should stroll over to Redmond with a laptop
that has a copy of the source untarred into an NTFS filesystem, and demand that
they cough up the source for NTFS.
Is anybody arguing that doing that would GPL NTFS? If no, then it doesn't GPL
any of the BK bits either.
