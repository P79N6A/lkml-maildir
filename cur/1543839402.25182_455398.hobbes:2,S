I wish page structs were just a simple array. ;)
It will just be a bit more code, but we'll need this for the two other
memory models: sparsemem and discontigmem.  For discontig, we'll just
need pointers in the pg_data_ts and, for sparsemem, we'll likely need
another pointer in the 'struct mem_section'.
This will effectively double the memory we need for sparsemem (because
we only use one pointer per SECTION_SIZE bytes of memory) but, that
should be just fine.
Is there ever any need to go from the accounting structure *back* to the
page?  I guess that might be the hard part with keeping parallel arrays,
if we even need it.
The reverse lookups might introduce a bit more pain with sparsemem and
discontig because, right now, we use bits in page->flags to help us go
find the containing node or the correct mem_section for the page.
