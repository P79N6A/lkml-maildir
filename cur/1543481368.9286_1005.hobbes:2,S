I'm trying to find out how quota is implemented.
I know about kernel options and such, but can find out if the kernel
maintains some sort of table in mem or if it's a file...
My asked me because the quota addon on NT didn't work and a quota report
initiated a full filesystemscan every time he wanted to know the status.
Then I say "Linux does this better"...
Can anyone give me directions to material on how quota actually works? I
know quota is and I use it, but I like to know how it actually works..
Best regards,
Steen Suder
PS
I don't read source good enough to find out myself.
