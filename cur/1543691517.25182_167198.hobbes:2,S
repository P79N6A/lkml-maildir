Hi Allen,
Do you know if an expected side-effect of this patch would
be increased stability? I see that the code does more than
just adding in a new UDMA number, I'm just wondering if the
other changes could be the deliberate cause of the reliability
I'm now seeing.
I have an nforce2 motherboard (Shuttle) with a Maxtor
UDMA133 drive. Operations such as dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null
would reliably freeze the machine under 2.4.23-pre4 at
UDMA100; I had to drop to UDMA44 to overcome this.
Since applying your patch, however, I've managed to run such
a dd, with zcav thrown in, with complete relability at UDMA133
for several hours without problems.
Thanks, Merlin
