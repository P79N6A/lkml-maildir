Sorry.  Should read:
*Everything* is preemptible except a few known code paths, whose
execution times determine the maximum possible latency from interrupt to
running the highest priority user process.
But, you'd know that, if you'd followed the development in the slightest

And, I think Ingo knows what "determinism" and "hard realtime" mean.  I
suggest you reread his posts.
