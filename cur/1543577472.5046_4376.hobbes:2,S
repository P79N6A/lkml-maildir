Every SPARC/Solaris machine completely ignores every TCP/SYN segment sourced 
from my linux 2.4.0 machine. Is it problem of kernel or missconfiguration? Or 
does Solaris something wrong?
I have used the kgcc (egcs-2.91.66) on my Red Hat 7.0 linux box for compiling 
the 2.4.0 kernel.
Problem appears also when not starting any firewall or packet scheduler.
SYN segments really reach the Solaris machine. I have used tcpdump on a 
router closest to the Solaris machine. But no response is seen. Also netstat 
on the Solaris machine doesn't report any SYN segment arrival.
When I initiate connection from Solaris machine everything goes OK. 
TCP/SYN,ACK segments are OK.
Can anyone help me?
Thanx
