Andi, that's horrible.  I suspect you know it's horrible and were hoping
someone would fix it properly.  The semantics of CPU_UP_PREPARE are
supposed to do this already.
The cause of this bug is that (1) i386 and x86_64 actually bring the
secondary CPUs up at boot before the core code officially brings them up
using cpu_up(), after the appropriate callbacks, and (2) they call into
core code tp process timer interrupts before they've been officially
brought up.
The former is because I just added a shim rather than rewriting the x86
boot process, because it would have broken too much.  The fix is do the
boot process properly, or to suppress the call to do_timer before the
CPU is actually "up".
Sorry,
Rusty.
