I found a patch called: slab-leak-detector.patch and applied it (manually 
since it's for a slightly older kernel).
Here are the results: (after leaking about 1MB)
c03741ba <__scsi_get_command+0x29/0x73>
Is the leaker with 294 of them, vs 4 of:
c03743fd <scsi_setup_command_freelist+0xb0/0x101>
and 21:
fffffffe <0xfffffffe>
I'm not sure how helpful that result is though, since I guess we already 
knew it was scsi, and from the other email, that's it's also some 
interaction with md.
