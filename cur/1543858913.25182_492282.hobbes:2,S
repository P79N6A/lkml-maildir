Ok, I've handwritten the messages, here they are :
reiser4 panicked cowardly : reiser4[umount(2451)] : commit_current_atom (fs/reiser4/txmngr.c:1087) (zam-597)
write log failed (-5)
[ got 2 copies of them because I have 2 reiser4 fs)
I got them mainly when I try to reboot or halt the machine, and the
process doesn't finish, the computer gets stuck after the reiser4
messages. This is only with 2.6.20-mm1, not 2.6.19-rc6-mm2.
