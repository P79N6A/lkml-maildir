0. yes we want that
1. can't tell
2. utf8 yes, many text files are in that encoding.
   large fonts - can't tell, I am fine with the regular vga
   font infrastructure (8x16, 8x8)
3. compositing - no, don't need that,
   wide characters - does not even work in vga. just display a '??'
   and everything is fine.
4. I do not really think this has a future on VC.
   You would also 'need' kerning and that serif combiner thing (complex
   shaping?) for Arabic. At best, Arabic would look as horrible on VC
   as it does in xterm today (no RTL, no serif combiner)
5. Vertical text - who else supports this please? Webpages in languages
   that want to do TTB(top-to-bottom) scripting use html workarounds -
   probably because TTB availability it's not even guaranteed in a
   webbrowser.
In short, the current console is very much OK.
