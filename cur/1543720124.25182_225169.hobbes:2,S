This is possible in one of the modes the FC kernel supports but not a
good default.
While most of the code we ship has no problems, 3rd party code is a
completely different story.  Most of the time this code is not as
cleanly written as the (cleaned-up) code we ship.  If anything, you can
announce your intention to change the default in a few years and urge
people to clean up their code.  If you want the maximum protection now
go with Ingo's exec-shield patch and the /proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield
entry which can be set to 2 to enable the strict mode.  That's certainly
the best solution for edge servers but not for application servers
running lots of dubious 3rd party code.
