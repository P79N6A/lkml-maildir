I am trying to read that last sentence and it just doesn't seem to make
any sense.
Or are you saying that all that anti-tivoization language that adds
complex requirements which change depending on the market some device
happens to be sold in and which will most likely make GPLv3 software
unusable for various applications ranging from medical equipment to
financial transaction systems (and probably others) is there to just
make it a _bit_ more inconvenient for vendors to implement a tivo-like
scheme?
So what exactly is the point of all this then?
