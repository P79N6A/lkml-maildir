Hmmmm,
couldn't repeat the problem using your method, with or without the 
netwrok card in.  I've only ever noticed the problem happen when running 
X ... ususally whilst compiling and starting netscape.  I'm assuming 
this is because data is being read from both drives.  But this doesn't 
explain why I've also lost irq on eth0.
[tooky@kane tooky]$ dmesg | grep eth0
eth0: RealTek RTL-8029 found at 0xa400, IRQ 17, 00:C0:DF:E9:11:89.
