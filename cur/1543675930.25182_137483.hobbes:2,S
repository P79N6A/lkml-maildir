Please debug it further.  Something may have gone wrong with the arithmetic

The sleep in blk_congestion_wait() terminates when a request is returned to
the queue.  The timeout is only really there for non-request-based backing
devices.

We need to wait until the amount of dirty memory in the machine is below
the designated limits.  This is unrelated to queue congestion.  The way the
logic is now we can have 256 megs worth of requests queues on a 32M machine
and everything throttles and clamps as intended.
There are several things wrong with blk_congestion_wait(), including:
a) it should be called throttle_on_io()
b) it should check that there are still requests in flight after parking
   itself on the waitqueue rather than relying on the timeout.
c) for memory reclaim we should terminate the sleep on a certain number
   of pages coming unreclaimable, not on write requests being returned or
   timeout.
d) network filesystems should be delivering wakeups to throttled
   processes rather than relying on the timeout.
But none of these have proven sufficiently problematic to justify futzing
with it.  I expect d) will eventually need to be implemented.
As for Adam's hang: dunno.  I and many others have run mkfs and dd an
unbelievable number of times.  He needs to debug it more.
