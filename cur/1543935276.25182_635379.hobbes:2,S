BTW, I have so far tested 2.6.24-rc4/5/6/7 and 2.6.23.12 - all of
which have this problem.
Yesterday I went back to using 2.6.22.15 and after a day's uptime it
has not reproduced with the same config.
Time for git-bisect I suppose? (the only problem is that this takes
anywhere between 20 minutes to 8 hrs to confirm reliably.)
