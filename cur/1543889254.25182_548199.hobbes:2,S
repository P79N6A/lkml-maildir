And what if it is 33 bits? Or it is not allowed?

It is a matter of definition - if segment size is allowed to be more
than 32 bits, then below transformation is not correct, otherwise
segment size should not use additional 32bits on 64bit platform, since
it is long.

You should definitely change that.
Btw, what about this piece:
int logfs_erase_segment(struct super_block *sb, u32 index)
{
	struct logfs_super *super = LOGFS_SUPER(sb);
	super->s_gec++;
	return mtderase(sb, index << super->s_segshift, super->s_segsize);
}
index << super->s_segshift might overflow, mtderase expects loff_t
there, since index can be arbitrary segment number, is it possible, that
overflow really occurs?
