yes, it's merged into the IOAPIC based NMI oopser. Usage is completely
automatic - it will oops if a hard lockup has occured. (ie. if a processor
does not server interrupts for more than 5 seconds.) I have tested this by
artificially causing kernel lockups, and it works here as expected.
so it's a simple 'apply, compile, reboot' thing.
