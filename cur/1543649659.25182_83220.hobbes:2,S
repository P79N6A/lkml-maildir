Ah, I didn't realize this.  So for some machines (like IBM's x440), we
should stick with using the hotplug controller driver, instead of using
the ACPI driver.  Sounds reasonable to me.

I think we now all agree that resource management should move into a
place where it can be shared by all pci hotplug drivers, right?
If so, anyone want to propose some common code?  I think the stuff in
the ACPI driver that was pulled from the Compaq driver is a great start.
I can try to pull this into the core myself, but if the Intel developers
have the time, and energy, I would greatly appreciate their help (or
anyone else who wants to join in.)
thanks,
