That's a single page shared by all threads on the system.  Or make this
a page per NUMA node.  And if the number of threads is larger than the
share counter for page, create a few more.
But in general the extra overhead would be minimal from the memory
consumption POV.

There is a different between having threads in the thread pool and
actually using them.  For every #omp loop the number of processors is
checked again and this is the number of threads from the pool which is used.

We need no events if determining the number of processors is cheap.
There is really no reason why it shouldn't.  Restarting all the threads
is not the cheapest operation so a single syscall (sys_sysconf, etc)
does not increase the cost a lot.

Ideally, as I said, an optimized vdso call is best.  But a syscall is
OK.  The nice thing about the vdso is that for now one could simply
implement it using a syscall and in future add optimizations to avoid
the kernel entry if possible.
A single syscall is two order of magnitude better than the best solution
available today.  This is my main concern right now.
