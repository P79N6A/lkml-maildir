Hello!
    Ok. In addition to "unsigned_var < 0" kind of error checks that
    never work, there is different non-working kind of checks:
    "pointer < 0".
    We can see these at:
drivers/char/joystick/tmdc.c:318	if (tmdc->abs[i] < 0) continue;
drivers/char/epca.c:3758		if (board.port <= 0)
drivers/char/epca.c:3770		if (board.membase <= 0)
drivers/media/radio/radio-cadet.c:541	if(request_region(io,2, "cadet-probe")>=0) {
drivers/net/wan/dscc4.c:1760		if (dscc4_init_dummy_skb(dpriv) < 0)
     Given the fact that you seem not to like casts to signed int,
     how do you propose to fix these?
Bye,
    Oleg
