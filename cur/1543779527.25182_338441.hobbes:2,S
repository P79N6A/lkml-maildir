Yes you must have learnt from akpm :P He's a master of that game. Thanks for 
replying :)

You're welcome, but I'm no coding expert and just applying a few styling 
issues as I see them.

Yeah, bzImage has some convoluted way of storing the gunzip code in the header 
and then it decompresses the image. This error implies something went 
horribly wrong but I have seen it before occasionally with gcc 4.0.1 - it 
usually goes away with reconfigure/rebuilding but this one didn't. Probably 
not important for this code per se.
