OK, now i figured it out. On AMD opteron 64 bit processors the only
option is the default: 4Kb. For itanium and mips, indeed, there are
multiple options. My CPUs are opteron 64 bit ones; that is why i was
not able to find this feature (of tuning it).

Not there.

Probably not in meminfo, but possibly in cpuinfo:
cat /proc/cpuinfo
...
TLB size        : 1024 4K pages
...
cat /proc/meminfo
