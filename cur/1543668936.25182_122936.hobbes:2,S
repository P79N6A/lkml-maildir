I'm trying an 2.5.66-mm kernel on 1386
I have 3 USB devices connected.
The mouse works - mostly (no wheel support)
But scanner and printer do not work.
The modules scanner and usblp seem to load fine
Apr  6 14:14:37 lisaserver kernel: drivers/usb/core/usb.c: registered
new driver usbscanner
Apr  6 14:14:37 lisaserver kernel: drivers/usb/image/scanner.c:
0.4.11:USB Scanner Driver
Apr  6 14:15:50 lisaserver kernel: drivers/usb/core/usb.c: registered
new driver usblp
Apr  6 14:15:50 lisaserver kernel: drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: v0.13: USB
Printer Device Class driver
but I do not get the devices under /dev to actually use them
I have a gentoo system that uses 
*  sys-apps/devfsd
      Latest version available: 1.3.25-r3
      Latest version installed: 1.3.25-r3
to load /dev
any ideas?
thanks
Jens
