I have two AMD MP 2000+ cpus in an ASUS A7M266-D. Even after returning 
my memory for new chips the store owner memtest86'd, my combo of cpus 
and mobo was finding the occasional error. I finally ended up 
resolving it by simply underclocking the bus about 6Mhz :( 
Next time, I'm buying ECC memory.
