Subject: swsusp resume doesn't sysdev_resume

Swsusp often fails on -mm kernels because sysdev_resume doesn't
get called in the resume path.  So things like ACPI IRQ links
used by modular drivers don't get restored.
We can work around this by using "pci=routeirq", so all the IRQ
setup gets done at boot-time, but that's an ugly hack, and I
expect that we'll trip over other sysdevs that need to be resumed
anyway.
I don't understand swsusp well enough to fix this.  It's not enough
to just call device_power_up() before device_resume(), because it
relies on sysdev_suspend() having been called before the suspend
image was created.
Any hints?
