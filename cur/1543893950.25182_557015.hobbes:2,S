It doesn't cover hardware, in the same way that it doesn't cover
patents, and it doesn't cover pro-DRM laws.  It merely arranges, as
best as we've managed a copyright license to do, that they can't be
used as excuses (or tools) to disrespect the freedoms that the GPL
demands all licensees to respect for other users.
