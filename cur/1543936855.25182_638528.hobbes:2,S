| Subject: 2.6.24-rc7 : oprofile on MPCore broken
| 
| Hello,
| 
| just tried to use oprofile on 2.6.24-rc7.
| It does not detect the right processor
|  (/dev/oprofile/cpu_type contains "timer").
| 
| As I don't know exactly, how the string
| "arm/mpcore" from arch/arm/oprofile/op_model_mpcore.c
| gets feeded into that file, maybe someone else can help ?
So people are hitting the resulting mess created by 09cadedbdc01f1a4bea1f427d4fb4642eaa19da9.
Can we please fix this regression one way or another please?
I don't particularly like stuffing the options into some random place
in the architectures Kconfig file when they should stay along side the
instrumentation configuration entries.
