Some kind of boot flag would cure this one nicely.
I have the same issue here:  boot/run notebook from USB stick,
eventually suspend the notebook and unplug the stick so it can
be packed into the case for travel.
Unpack at the other end, replug the stick, and resume from suspend.
This should be doable, perhaps with a boot parameter override or something.
