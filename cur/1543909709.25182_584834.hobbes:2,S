Three comments:
- Randy made sysfs_remove_bin_file() return void in commit
995982ca79d9262869513948ec7c540f32035491.
- For symmetry reasons, sysfs_remove_file() should then also pass the
return value on.
- I'm not sure who wants to care whether they removed an existing or
non-existing file. But maybe I'm just unimaginative.
