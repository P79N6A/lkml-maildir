Unfortunately making statfs alone aware of them does not help. Most useful
tools that use statfs go to /proc/mouts, read all the entries and invoke
statfs for each path. So if for some non-root path different values are
returned, these tools won't see them anyway. So try to think about how to
provide the info about subfilesystems first.
