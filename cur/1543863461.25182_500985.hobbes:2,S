You are printing "page_address()" of each of the pages here.

You are printing "tpage" instead of page_address(tpage)" here so of course 
it will not be the same as what you did above where you printed the 
page_address() instead of the pages themselves...

Only if you do it page by page as the pages are not physically contiguous, 
i.e. you would have to call vmalloc_to_page() for each page in the 
vmalloced area and then create a scatter-gather DMA operation working on 
each page in sequence.  I suspect this is not what you want...
You will need to read up on doing DMA mappings from the kernel to learn 
how to make memory physicall contiguous.  Hint start with reading 
Documentation/DMA-API.txt and DMA-mapping.txt...
