Hi,
There are 2 routers on my network.
Router A routes to other internal networks
Router B routes to the Internet
My box has A as the default gateway.
It should get redirects for the Internet hosts and it does.
But despite icmp redirects are not filtered and
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth1/accept_redirects is 1 it does not learn
the paths and i simply get flooded by the router with redirects about
every single packet that is sent.
What could be wrong?
Regards,
Maciej Soltysiak
