Hi Martin,
I am going to work with Carol (cc'ed below) to put out the module code 
that we have under GPL.  We need to run it through our EMC (relatively 
newish) open source process to get official permission, but I don't 
expect any big hurdles.
Are you the right person for Carol to work with on the code structure, 
style, etc once we get the green light to move forward?
Regards,
ric
