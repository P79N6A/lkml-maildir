I think the asm is not the issue.  the only stuff used is constant and pointer 
generation code, no machine instructions.  All that would have to be done is to 
describe, in the dwarft language, the interrupt frame.  This is different for 
different archs so this is where the work would be needed.
Daniel has suggested that we could just use the new bin tools where in the gas 
program will build the call frames.  I am not sure it can handle expressions, 
however.  And they are needed if you want to tie off the frame if the next step 
is user land.
By the way, I don't try to build a blow by blow of the frame.  Rather I assume 
it is only of interest at those points where calls are made out of the interrupt 
/trap code.  (Or, in some cases, jumps are made back into it.)
