I don't understand why you write. Looking at your code, I don't see
the point. By mixing C and assembly the way you do, and using those
horrible inline asm constructs, you are basically making the code
worse, less readable, and prone for bugs. I don't think you should
even try going into that direction, it makes no sense.
