Even if they did use modules, the module interface is not necessarily a 
GPL barrier.  The fact that the unit becomes useless if you remove the 
kernel or the bluetooth drivers means that it's a complete work and not 
merely an aggregate.
I don't understand why companies think they can get away with this kind 
of intellectual property theft.
I also don't understand why they don't use BSD instead.  They wouldn't 
have ANY of these problems.
