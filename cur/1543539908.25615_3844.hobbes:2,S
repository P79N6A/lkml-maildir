Chill, Dude.
The ranting has been officially declared VERBOTEN! 
(That's probably not spelled right- I went to Public High Schools in the
USA where I was prohibited from taking German as a second language
because my cousin (with the same last name) was already in the class. I
kid you not.)
Besides, the plan is/was/may someday be to default to SAFE, don't screw
the drive mode, with a kernel compile time option to allow you to tinker
with an unrestricted interface. You can have your undiluted root power
anytime you want. Seems like a very acceptable compromise to me, as most
of the new Linux users don't know who 'root' is, or think they are
sharing their computers with their houseplants...
