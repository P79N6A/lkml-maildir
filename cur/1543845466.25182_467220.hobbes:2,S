First, forgive me, since I've got a bit of a head cold, so I'm even
slower then usual. I just don't see how this patch changes the behavior.
Every second we will call second_overflow. But in the case where we
skipped 100 ticks, we don't loop 100 times. Could you explain this a bit
more?

I'm not sure how this is functionally different from what this patch
does.

Not following this one at all.
Again, sorry for being so thick.
