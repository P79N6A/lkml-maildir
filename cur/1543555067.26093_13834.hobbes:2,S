Subject: "No IRQ known for interrupt pin A..." error message

During boot, I get the message:
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:00.1. Please try
using pci=biosirq.
If I boot with pci=biosirq, as the error message suggests, I get the
same error, save the part about trying with pci=biosirq.  This is with
version 2.4.0-test11-pre7 and as far back at least as test10-final.  I
don't remember seeing this error on earlier versions, though I may have
glossed over it.  Another possibly relevant part of the boot messages
is:
PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xfdb81, last bus=1
PCI: Using configuration type 1
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
PCI: Using IRQ router default [1039/0008] at 00:01.0
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 9 of bridge 00:02.0
My motherboard uses the SiS530 chipset, and the bridge at 00:02.0 is the
AGP bridge.  If anyone's interested, I have the entire boot log.
