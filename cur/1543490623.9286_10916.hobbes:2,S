Hi David and the Linux Brethren,
The attached patch integrates the gdb remote kernel debugging facility
into
the kernel as a CONFIG_I386_REMOTE_DEBUG option in a manner similar to the
one used for MIPS, Alpha, sparc and ppc architectures. At the moment this
feature is maintained (by David) as a separate package (gdbstubs-2.0.36)
but since the other archs do it in the mainstream kernel I thought it
would be nice if x86 did the same.
Note that I did not cc:Linus because:
1. It needs thorough testing before we send it to him for blessing.
2. There are a couple of cleanups I intend to do (though it does not stop
you from testing it now!).
Any opinions are welcome, as usual :)
Regards,
Tigran.
