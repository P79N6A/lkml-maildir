Hello,
is there a chance to get working Marvell PATA IDE Controller?
According to lspci it has 11ab:6101 ID.
If I add this ID into ahci.c, it finds one SATA port with no drive attached.
Actually, it has one PATA connector with DVD+RW attached to it.
In Windows XP, it is recognized as generic PCI IDE device.
