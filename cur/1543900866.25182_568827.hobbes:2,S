Subject: [PATCH] destroy_workqueue() can livelock
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Pointed out by Michal Schmidt <mschmidt@redhat.com>.
The bug was introduced in 2.6.22 by me.
cleanup_workqueue_thread() does flush_cpu_workqueue(cwq) in a loop until
->worklist becomes empty. This is live-lockable, a re-niced caller can
get CPU after wake_up() and insert a new barrier before the lower-priority
cwq->thread has a chance to clear ->current_work.
Change cleanup_workqueue_thread() to do flush_cpu_workqueue(cwq) only once.
We can rely on the fact that run_workqueue() won't return until it flushes
all works. So it is safe to call kthread_stop() after that, the "should stop"
request won't be noticed until run_workqueue() returns.
