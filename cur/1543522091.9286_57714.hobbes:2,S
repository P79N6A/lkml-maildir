Hey Mike,
Isn't the second already the SI unit for time?
look at the NIST page here.
http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/atomic.html
"In 1967 the cesium atom's natural frequency was formally recognized
as the new international unit of time: the second was defined as
exactly 9,192,631,770 oscillations or cycles of the cesium atom's
resonant frequency replacing the old second that was defined in terms
of the earth's motions. The second quickly became the physical
quantity
most accurately measured by scientists. The best primary cesium
standards
now keep time to about one-millionth of a second per year."
We just need to start using the 10^(3n) prefixes
withe it on the positive side. We already
use ms (milisecond), ns (nanosecond), us (microsecond)
and such. Now we need ks (kilosecond), Ms (megasecond),
etc...
But changing the name would be cool. Lest seperate
time for angle measurments :)
