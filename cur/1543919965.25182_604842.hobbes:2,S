Subject: [PATCH] git scsi misc include fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/14/23

From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
The added line in scsi_eh.h:
	struct scatterlist sense_sgl;
fails to compile, with the error:
	field 'sense_sgl' has incomplete type
unless scatterlist.h happens to be included
somehow already ... which it isn't always.
So include scatterlist.h in scsi_eh.h directly.
