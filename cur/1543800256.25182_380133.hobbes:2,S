Hi,
I read in an old thread that this question was asked once and you replied you 
never heard of this chip. Maybe now the situation has changed? If not, please 
take a look here:
http://www.jmicron.com/product/jmb360.htm
It claims the chip is ahci compatible, but the libata ahci driver can't detect 
it (tried 2.6.14.2 and 2.6.15-rc7).
Maybe just adding some ids or such is enough for supporting it? 
Following lspci -vvv -xxx regrading the Jmicron stuff:

It would be nice if we could support in Linux. Maybe you want to contact 
JMicron?
Cheers,
