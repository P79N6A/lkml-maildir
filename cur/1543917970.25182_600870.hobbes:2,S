So maybe the following patch is necessary...
I believe IPV6 & DCCP are immune to this problem.
Thanks again Denys for spotting this.

[PATCH] TCP : secure_tcp_sequence_number() should not use a too fast clock
TCP V4 sequence numbers are 32bits, and RFC 793 assumed a 250 KHz clock.
In order to follow network speed increase, we can use a faster clock, but
we should limit this clock so that the delay between two rollovers is
greater than MSL (TCP Maximum Segment Lifetime : 2 minutes)
Choosing a 64 nsec clock should be OK, since the rollovers occur every
274 seconds.
