  Hi Andrew,
  it seems we've accidentally lost one JBD fix (probably it was my mistake
when rediffing some checkpointing changes) as Kirill has noted. A transaction
can currently be released when there are still some buffers on one of its
checkpointing lists. Attached patch should fix it (it still seems to apply
fine). Please apply it. Thanks.

We have to check that also the second checkpoint list is non-empty before
dropping the transaction.
