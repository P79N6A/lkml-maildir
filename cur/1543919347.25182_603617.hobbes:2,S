Excellent!  However, I don't see the following:
* case 0x182: map_key_clear(KEY_FAVORITES);
  ... in drivers/usb/input/hid-input.c, to handle the My Favorites key
* the change to drivers/hid/usbhid/usbkbd.c to enable the "(" and
  ")" on the right hand side of the keyboard
Have these already been included elsewhere?
Yours truly,
John Zaitseff
