Finally, I debugged it today. The problem is in PNP BIOS. pnp_bus_suspend() 
calls pnp_stop_dev() for the device if the device can be disabled according 
to pnp_can_disable(). The problem is that pnpbios_disable_resources() 
returns -EPERM if the device is not dynamic (!pnpbios_is_dynamic()) but 
insert_device() happily sets PNP_DISABLE capability/flag even if the device 
is not dynamic. So we try to disable non-dynamic devices which will fail. 
This patch prevents insert_device() from setting PNP_DISABLE if the device is 
not dynamic and fixes suspend on my system.
