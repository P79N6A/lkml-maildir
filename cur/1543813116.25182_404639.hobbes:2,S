Not true.  Plenty of root bridges have the same base/limit style
configuration registers, but they are non-standard.  Even worse - the MMIO
hole thatthe chipset carves out, is not guaranteed to be big enough for
some new random allocation.

Cleaning up and re-doing are not the same thing.  The plethora of x86
chipsets makes this unpleasant at best and more likely unworkable.
