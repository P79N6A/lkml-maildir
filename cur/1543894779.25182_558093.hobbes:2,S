again, this is about *indentation* and not about alignment

Linus was friendly enough to give us permission to use tabs. He forces tabs for 
indentation, but leaves it up to everyone else to (1) set their editor to show 
tabs as 2 or 4 or whatever, and (2) use spaces for alignment.
the bottom line here is that we encourage everyone to use tabs=8, and allow some 
degree of freedom for some people to vary this *AND* have decent looking 
alignment for *EVERYONE* by allowing them to use spaces for alignment.
Nothing in the codingstyle document confirms or denies this, so I will assume 
that it is _allowed_ to use spaces for alignment.
the checkpatch.pl script doesn't disallow spaces for alignment - it is dumb 
enough to complain about more than 8 spaces for alignment.
That is and was the whole point... and worth the addition to CodingStyle for me
