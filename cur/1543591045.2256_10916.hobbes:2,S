This might get us into problems when we think we have enough
inactive pages to take the next load spike, but we don't.
On the other hand, that's a theoretical situation and I don't
think we'll hit that in practice ... at least, not in workloads
we'd be able to deal nicely with in any way.
Just going with the simple version should work.
