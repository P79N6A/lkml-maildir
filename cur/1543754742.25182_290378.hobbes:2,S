First, a little clarification: FUSE doesn't use ioctl() for
communication between the kernel and userspace.  It uses read() and
write().
That aside, you are right, that this change breaks any kind of FUSE
based filesystem.  However the fix is trivial: install FUSE version
2.2-pre5 or later.  The filesystems themselves don't need to be
rebuilt, since the fix in the shared library will automatically get
used.
Thanks,
Miklos
