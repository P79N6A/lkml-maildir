I've definetly not done any such change on my machine. Remember with the 
same compile, same environment, if i go back to 2.6.18 i can build uml 
fine. If i move to 2.6.18.1 or above it breaks...
I do notice my gcc stddef does have this defined
% grep offsetof /usr/lib/gcc/i686-linux/4.0.3/include/stddef.h
#define offsetof(TYPE, MEMBER) __builtin_offsetof (TYPE, MEMBER)
And i notice my compiler has it inbuilt, so maybe this is a gcc 4.0.3 
issue ?
% strings /usr/libexec/gcc/i686-linux/4.0.3/cc1|grep offsetof
offsetof_member_designator
__builtin_offsetof
fold_offsetof_1
-Winvalid-offsetof
Warn about invalid uses of the "offsetof" macro

The last time I saw this, someone had replaced the glibc kernel
headers with a link to include/ within a kernel pool.  There, offsetof
is wrapped in #ifdef __KERNEL__, and inaccessible to userspace.
The glibc headers have a usable offsetof, so fix that, and UML should
build.
