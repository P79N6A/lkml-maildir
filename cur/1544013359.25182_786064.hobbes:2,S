Yes, the i915 driver now relies on fb code, though the new features are
runtime optional.  I may have noviced the Kconfig bits -- my intention
was "If you select I915, you also get all the CONFIG_FB-related bits
necessary".
config DRM_I915
        select FB_CFB_FILLRECT
        select FB_CFB_COPYAREA
        select FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT
        depends on FB
        tristate "i915 driver"
I'm guessing that that "depends on FB" wants to be "select FB".
