On the other hand, I was once like you.  I knew my hardware was good. I
mean, I *knew* it.  I'd been running Linux on that machine for two years,
all the components had been tested when I bought them, all were quality
(okay, in retrospect, maybe not the Cyrix CPU, but it definitely wasn't
using bargain-basement PNY memory ;-).  It started crashing every day.  
After I swapped one of the SIMMs out in late June, it hasn't crashed
since....
BTW, Alan, I've been meaning to tell you.  If you've put any crash reports
in your database of random unexplained problems from me from June, you can
probably delete 'em as hardware problems....
later,
chris
