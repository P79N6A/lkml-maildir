I am not surprised - patch-2.2.11 contains a very strange patch
on aha1542.c by Chris Faulhaber. Maybe it somehow was munged.
Anyway, the easiest is to just revert it.
(Let us look at the patch:
	+#ifdef MODULE
	+    bases[0] = 4;
	+    bases[1] = aha1542[0];
	+    bases[2] = aha1542[1];
	+    bases[3] = aha1542[2];
	+    bases[4] = aha1542[3];
	+#endif
and the declaration of bases:
	#define MAXBOARDS 2
	static unsigned int bases[MAXBOARDS]={0x330, 0x334};
So, it seems this will scribble on memory past bases.
Also: bases[] contains the addresses being probed for.
But the patch has
	+#if defined(MODULE)
	+int aha1542[] = { 0x330, 11, 4, -1 };
	+MODULE_PARM(aha1542, "1-4i");
	+#endif
numbers that do not look like bases at all.
Maybe this was copied from some other driver and happened to do
what the patcher wanted?)

P.S. patch-2.2.11 contains one other change to aha1542.c, namely
-     if(mbenable_result[1] & 0x03) retval = BIOS_TRANSLATION_25563;
+     if((mbenable_result[0] & 0x08) && (mbenable_result[1] & 0x03))
+       retval = BIOS_TRANSLATION_25563;
I do not think this is precisely right, but certainly the new code
is better than the old, so this part of the patch should not be
reverted.
