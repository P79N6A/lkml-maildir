Sorry, the usage of us_to_tb got dropped from the patch when I moved
it from one of my development trees to another.  It gets used in
usecs_to_cycles().  The patch to add that is attached below.
Even with the usage of us_to_tb by usecs_to_cycles(), there is a lot
of added clutter for what is accomplished.  I considered a nasty hack
to try to derive the proper value from other sources, but adding
us_to_tb seemed a lot easier to understand.
This patch also adds the dreaded #ifdefs, so I suspect it will not be
the correct implementation long term.  I'm not sure if Manish's patch
included the ARM implementation of usecs_to_cycles() - it is a third
case in the #ifdef.
Performance instrumentation is also going to need mcount() and
_mcount(), which is currently a work in progress.

Yes, I will do that.
