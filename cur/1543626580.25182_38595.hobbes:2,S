I've replicated the problem too.
I've diabled preemption in the area where it used to be disabled because 
of the old lock_kernel().  I'm sending this message from a machine with 
that patch applied, so the patch does fix it.  As the comment says, this 
is something that the preempt experts need to take a look at.
Linus, this is a hack, and there is probably still a window where 
preemption can happen.  But, it is a band-aid until we find the real 
problem.
