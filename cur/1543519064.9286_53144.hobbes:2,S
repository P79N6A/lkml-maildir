should we really add another function to the sys_ipc demultiplexer? Alpha
has normal syscalls, and all other architectures complain about the
"horrible hack".
I would propose that we add a new sysctl "shmget2()" with a "size_t size"
variable, and that we truncate the segment length for shmctl(IPC_GET) to
MAX_INT. The message queue code does that as well, and we can fix it
properly with the 32-bit UID patches.
Btw, both the Sparc64 and the PPC code still call "lock_kernel()" before
calling the ipc functions. The new ipc functions are thread safe, someone
could remove these calls.
