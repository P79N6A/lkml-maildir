So in simplier terms.  You recommend I install a Linux partition onto the Maxtor
drive, unplug the Winsdor drive, and see if the 2.2 kernel will boot.
I'm not too encouraged about the idea that the 2.0 kernel can handle hardware that
the new kernel can't, especially since there is no detectable hardware problem.  But
I will try it.
