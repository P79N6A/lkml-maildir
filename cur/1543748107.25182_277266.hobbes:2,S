Hi,
I also got the FS corruption when trying "rm -f ..." as descripted.
Filesystems affected: Reiser4 and ext3.
But I'm using kernel 2.6.10-rc2-mm4 - so a patch moved from -mm into -rc3 seems to be responsible for that problem.
A candidate might be: "fix-an-xfs-direct-i-o-deadlock.patch" found in -mm4 and gone into -rc3.
Sorry, I can't test now if this patch is responsible (I'm not at home).
But may be someone else can do.
Regards,
Carsten
