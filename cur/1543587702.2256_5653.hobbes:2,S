	You will, probably, need to run the VRRPed interface port
	in PROMISCUOUS mode, or use multicast address for the MAC-
	address, and process reception of that correctly.
	There probably are more problems at using the multicast
	MAC address, than turning the interface into promiscuous.
	(At least the Linux packet reception path treats MC MAC
	 destined packets specially.)
	ARP request gets in because it is MAC-level broadcast.
