I have an ASUS m/b with dual Celerons (currently set to design speed
66/366) with RedHat 6.0, 2.2.5 kernel with softdog configured.
Q1. Is softdog SMP-safe ?
I have had a couple of unexplained hangs, so that on rebooting fsck runs.
I confess I don't entirely understand how SMP handles boot, running shell
scripts etc. It seems to me that both processors are running and their
messages are interleaved in the log, for example I get:
Jun 12 04:16:12 daviel-v rc.sysinit: Mounting local filesystems succeeded 
.
Jun 12 04:11:20 daviel-v rc.sysinit: Enabling swap space succeeded

Jun 12 04:11:22 daviel-v modprobe: can't locate module lo:0 
.

Jun 12 04:11:23 daviel-v modprobe: can't locate module eth0:8

Jun 12 04:11:23 daviel-v modprobe: can't locate module eth0:49 
Jun 12 04:11:23 daviel-v network: Bringing up interface eth0 succeeded 
.
I have messages interleaved with different timestamp streams, which I
conjectured are from different processors. When fsck ran, I got several
messages about could not locate lo0 and eth0; I wondered if one processor
was trying to load the modules while the other one was still running fsck.
Is this true, and if so am I supposed to have configured something in the
sysinit for SMP?
I have softdog built in the kernel (as suggested in softdog-1.2/README)
and /sbin/softdog started in rc.d/rc.local (after all fsck). On a couple
of occasions it seemed as if softdog rebooted the machine while it was
still running fsck, so again I wondered if somehow CPU#2 had started
softdog while CPU# was still busy running fsck, and softdog had then
failed to write the testfile or something an triggered a shutdown.
