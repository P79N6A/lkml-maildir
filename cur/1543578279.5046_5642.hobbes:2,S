FYI -- the epic100 SMC EtherPower II card does NOT work in SMP mode on 2.4.0
(or 2.2.18 either).
Donald Becker's most recent version hasn't been forward-ported to 2.4 and
the 2.2.17 drivers won't compile either.
The SMC card DOES work in non-SMP machines.  So...I'm putting in a 3com905
until this gets fixed.
Don said that locking was broken in the 1.1.5 release.
The last SMP kernel that ran with the SMC was 2.2.17 -- it's been broke
since (i.e. 2.2.18 does'nt work either -- that's where 1.1.5 was
introduced).
