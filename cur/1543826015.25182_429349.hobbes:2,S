The code in wake_sleeping_dependent() is also quite wacky: it unlocks
current runqueue, then re-acquires ALL the sibling runqueue lock, only
to call wakeup_busy_runqueue() against the smt sibling runqueue other
than itself.  AFAICT, wakeup_busy_runqueue() does not require *ALL*
sibling lock to be held.
