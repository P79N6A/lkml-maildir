additional page aging cannot make it different as far I can tell.
The twekaing I'm speaking about is a number. After probing the cache and
after getting many faliures I need to choose when it's time to start
the pagetable scanning. Additional bit of aging can only influence the number of
faliures, I cannot see how can it help to know when to start the
pagetable scanning. It's a _ratio_ between the faliures and the size of
the scan that tells me when it's the time. You need the same logic too
somewhere in -ac vm. Now if I turn the ratio very high the cache will
shrink more before we start pagetable scanning.  If I make it low we'll
swapout very easily. This ratio doesn't need to be perfect, it will
never trigger anyways most of the time, but it must be a sane number,
and it can make some difference during swapout.
