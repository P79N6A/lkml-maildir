Hi,
We've measured gettimeofday() cost on both of Xeon and P3, too.
We also measured them on different kernels (UP and MP).
                Xeon(2GHz)     P3(1GHz)
=========================================
UP kernel       939[ns]       441[ns]
               1878[cycles]   441[cycles]
-----------------------------------------
MP kernel      1054[ns]       485[ns]
               2108[cycles]   485[cycles]
-----------------------------------------
(The kernel version is 2.4.18)
In this experiment, Xeon is two times slower than P3, despite that the
frequency of the Xeon is two times faster.  More over, the performance
difference between UP and MP is very interesting in Xeon case.  The
difference of Xeon (230 cycles) is five times larger than that of P3
(44 cycles).
We think that the instructions with lock prefix in the MP kernel
damage the Xeon performance which serialize operations in an execution
pipeline.  On the P4/Xeon systems, these lock operations should be
avoided as possible as we can.
The following web page shows the details of this experiment.
