See, even though I'm not fundamentally against using kernel debuggers, I
think this is very wrong. Where are you now? You are just learning about
the bio interface and the changes needed to make it run. And this is
definitely the most wrong point to start using a debugger, and can only
result in a dac960 that works by trial and error.
