Im unconvinced. Where is the exploit documented ? If the exploit relies
on overwriting the tcp header remember that even the base firewall config
doesn't allow this.

Except that I construct attacks to use massive amounts of AVL tree space.
Very easily in fact. On something like an appliance with 8Mb of RAM that
makes the AVL setup a non solution and something better is needed
