I'm currently working on a patch to make it a single sysctl, I've got it 
working (as in, the kernel doesn't crash). I still need to validate the 
actual implementation.
I'd say the next stage is to merge fields as much as possible.
I doubt the real use of selection by route/dest, all of the high-speed 
protocols (except possibly for TCP-Hybla) are intended for sender-only 
servers who push lots of data and should work in all cases and alongside 
  Reno TCP traffic without undue unfairness.
I hope to finish the clean-up and preparation of H-TCP for inclusion in 
the kernel and can then help with the unionisation.
