It's because of this bit in the standard:
    If there is no such call and if the underlying file is modified
    as a result of a write reference, then these fields shall be
    marked for update at some time after the write reference.
It could be done in munmap/mremap, but it seemed more difficult to
track down all the places where the vma is removed.  But yes, that may
be a nicer solution.
