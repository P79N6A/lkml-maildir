I'd like also to question current policies of user space irqbalanced. It
seems to just go round-robin without much heuristics involved. We are
seeing loss of timer interrupts on our systems - and the more processors
the more noticeable it is, but it starts even on 8x partitions; on 48x
system I see about 50% loss, on both ia32 and x86_64 (haven't checked on
ia64 yet). With say 16 threads it is unsettling to see 70% overall idle
time, and still only 40-50% of interrupts go through. System's time is
not affected, so the problem is on the back burner for now :) It's not
clear yet whether this is software or hardware fault, and how much
damage it does (performance wise etc.) I will provide more information
as it becomes available, just wanted to raise red flag, maybe others
also see such phenomena.
Thanks,
