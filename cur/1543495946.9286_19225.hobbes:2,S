I also donnot want it since it seems very broken to me.

Donnot know of Plan9, but AFAIK it has been invented by the inventors of 
traditionnal UNIX. ;-)

My opinion is that we got race conditions we deserve if we donnot lock
when we should do so. The above code just enforces some ordering of
operations using some locks or barriers that are not visible.  It may be
correct, but it is complex and relies to much on synchronisation done in
our back.
Both the test of the condition and the entering to the SLEEP/WAIT/...  on
event/channel/... needs to be atomic. So any SLEEP/WAIT thing should only
be entered with a LOCK in SMP (or with interrupt disable in UP), and it is
the SLEEP/WAIT thing that will unlock the LOCK (or reenable interrupt) at
a moment that avoid races.
For O/Ses that support SMP, any WAIT_ON_CHANNEL_ETC.. interface that does
not require a LOCK as argument seems to me incorrect or just too complex
to deal with. ;-)

It is perhaps correct in theory, but it pollutes most of kernel data
structures with wait_queues.
For example, what happens if we free a data structure with some not 
empty wait queue in it ?
By the way, I am unable to propose a good sleep/wakeup interface :), 
but I think that some much better must exist.
