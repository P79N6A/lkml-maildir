Successfully tested on a Thinkpad T21. Any feedback regarding
performance would be very helpful. Desktop users should notice top(1)
is faster, kernel hackers that kernel compiles are faster, and highmem
users should see much less per-process lowmem overhead.
This release is vastly cleaned up compared to the test8 release, and
features the wchan and major/minor fault accounting fixes. I still
need to fold the anobjrmap fixes into the original patches and find
some alternative way for smbfs and ncpfs to do whatever d_validate()
was doing for them. I also need to find a coherent way to incorporate
the cleanups for pte caching suggested by akpm without bloating the
pte cache on lowmem boxen (but nothing radical like 4/4 or pgcl).
It's also worth noting that the patches "originally due" to someone
were just plucked off of the list by me (in some cases, they just first
implemented of the idea), so be sure to ascribe all the credit to
them, and all the bugs to me. I wasn't sure of a complete (or even
partial) list of those to credit for top-down vma allocation, hence
"various", though it was jejb who described the glibc workaround.
