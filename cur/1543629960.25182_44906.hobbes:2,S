I think this patch, unlike the two previous cleanups, still needs some
polishing.

Urgg, sourceforge seems to have turned these nice links into some download
selector crap.  I think it's really time to stop using it as it gets worse
all time..
Any chance you could post links directly to one of the mirrors next time?

The core_ibmnumaq.* naming looks strange to me.  It seems derived from the
alpha naming where we support many different cores.  I think numaq.c
would fit much better in the naming of the other files in arch/i386/kernel/.
Please also note that the ifdef around the whole file body in core_ibmnumaq.c
is superflous as we already have the kbuild conditional.

Okay, this comes to the next issue, you seem to use CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM
and CONFIG_X86_DISCONTIGMEM interchangable in arch/i386/* and numa.c in
fact has a big #ifdef CONFIG_X86_DISCONTIGMEM around all of the code.
AFAICS CONFIG_X86_DISCONTIGMEM is really the selector for the bootmem
workarounds and I think it shouldn't be used anywhere else, or even better
replaced by and HAVE_ARCH_BOOTMEM_NODE #define in asm/pgtable.h.
Also why is this file named numa.c and depends on CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM?
Either it is NUMA-specific and depends on CONFIG_NUMA or it is dicontig
code and should be named discontig.c or something like that.  This file
is completly about memory managment, btw so I wonder why it isn't placed
in arch/i386/mm/..

What about makeing this a static inline in one of the asm/ headers?
This way the external users also have it inline and I know besides
NUMAQ at least the LKCD people also want it.
