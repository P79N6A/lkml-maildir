Well, that's because the semantics weren't _supposed_ to change. The new 
semantics were meant to be a superset of the old behaviour, with just the 
added "task" subdirectory that lists the actual threads.
However, you're right that "/proc/self" should likely point into the
_thread_, and not into the task. But it's debatable. You are very likely 
the only one who could ever care ;)

Well, the changelog mentions "fix for hidden task problem", since the diff 
really is mainly to _add_ threads to the /proc layout. The fact that it 
changed /proc/self is actually a bit surprising. Albert?

I think /proc/self most likely _should_ point into the thread, not the 
task.
