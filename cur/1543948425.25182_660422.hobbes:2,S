Ah I see sorry. If you want to just speed up vmalloc flushing I think
the easier way would be to just extend the normal TLB flusher for
vmalloc. So alone for this it probably wouldn't be worth it.
But I think it'll be useful for a couple of other things.

The isolation work is not merged yet, but it will essentially need
to turn a lot of the _call_function()s into _call_function_mask()
