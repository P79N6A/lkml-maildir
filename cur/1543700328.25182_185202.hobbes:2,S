Andrew, I'm ok with these patches (and it looks like Christoph doesn't
find them too repulsive either) and David said he'd rather have you take
them directly if they look ok.  Will you merge them into your tree

people using Altix machines, and contains a number of important bug
fixes.
Thanks,
Jesse
