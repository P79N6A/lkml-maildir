Well the &0x8000000 stuff is suspicious. 
Firstly the operation isnt atomic. So a user program on another CPU could
clash with the above and end up entering/leaving quickack mode in error. That
would only be safe if tp->ato is only touched from net_bh/timer_bh. That
doesnt appear to be the case.
Secondly tcp_send_delayed_ack reads the timeout but doesnt mask the quickack
bit. I think this latter one is in itself Ok because the quickack is exited
before its called
