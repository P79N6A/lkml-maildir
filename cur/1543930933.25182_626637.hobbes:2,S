Can you talk more about how you imagined syslets working with
sys_indirect()?
I threw something together to test most of the machinery around the
actual argument passing.  It just added the syslet arguments to the union:
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/6/338
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/6/339
This obviously doesn't work because it's a perfectly reasonable thing to
want to provide the file_flags to some call as well as the syslet args
to perform that call in a syslet.
Then it butchers sys_indirect() itself:
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/6/340
The syslet machinery wants to run some code before and after the system
call itself when the syslet arguments are provided.  It can also call
almost every single system call, white-listing in sys_indirect() is
probably not the answer here.
I could throw together some ideas, of course, but thought I'd see if you
guys already had a design in mind that I could pursue.
