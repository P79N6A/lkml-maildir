Seriously, ALSA has some issues at the moment which OSS doesn't have.
The main one is that OSS does not require mmap() access, whereas ALSA
native does at present - and there are architectures where the ALSA
method of mmap() both the ring buffer and the control data does not
work.
These issues aren't simple to resolve - as can be seen from the
recent lkml threads on the subject.  I've been seriously considering
submitting the existing OSS drivers I have here for ARM hardware
instead of trying to convert them to ALSA drivers first, and
considering whether I should be writing new OSS drivers in
preference to ALSA drivers.
That's not to say I don't want to see ALSA progress though - which is
why I'm working to try to get these issues resolved.
