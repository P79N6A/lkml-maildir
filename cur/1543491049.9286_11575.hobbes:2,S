Hi,
I have problems with the kernel-2.2.3.
obelix:~# tcpdump -i eth0
tcpdump: SO_ATTACH_FILTER: No such file or directory(2)
whereas it seems to be operational under kernel-2.1.131.
I have checked that my kernel allows socket filtering by enabling the
option and recompiling it. But nothing has changed :-( !
Thanks for any help !
Simon.
