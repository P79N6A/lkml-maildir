The fragmentation issue I think is overbaked. A lot of the academic work
argues that there is pretty much no long term difference between first
fit, best fit, and most of the clever algorithms (obviously stupid ones
like "take the middle out of the biggest space allocator" do perform
worse). For MMUless boxes fragmentation is a big issue but not for normal
systems.
