There are several scsi controllers that handle pci error recovery.
For example, look at drivers/scsi/ipr.c, search for 
struct pci_error_handlers. The callback routines there deal
with reseting the driver after an error has been found.
I've posted patches in the past for the symbios driver;
I suppose it is time to clean them up and resubmit them
again; they are not in the kernel yet.
I recently posted patches for the Emulex lpfc fibre channel 
scsi card, google for the subject line
  "[PATCH] lpfc: add PCI error recovery support"
to see what the patch looks like.
All of this work was done on powerpc systems. I have only
a vague idea of how this works on PC-class Intel platforms.
