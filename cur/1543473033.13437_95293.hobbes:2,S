If it was limited to a *specific* application, it would not warrent being
placed it the kernel.
One use would be for low level file (device) acesss as mentioned in the 'wipe'
thread. Compounding two pipes, to strip 4,000,000,000 line feeds, from using
the 'yes' | 'tr' is slow and sloppy. It also assumes both commands are actually
available.
