Yeah, introduced by:
http://git2.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=d3cf209476b72c83907a412b6708c5e498410aa7
Thanks for reporting the problem, Jesper.

xfs_trans_free() is not supposed to be called by anything but the transaction
code (it's static). So a xfs_trans_cancel() would need to be issued.

NACK ;)
xfs_trans_cancel() is needed. Patch below.
Cheers,
