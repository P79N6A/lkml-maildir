The port 53 bindings happen without problem.
BINDv9 has a lightweight resolver service which runs on port 921 - this is
not enabled by default, and when it is enabled, seems to start up later on
in the startup process.
Add the single line:
lwres {};
in your named.conf and it will be enabled.

Taking capabilities away seems to break backwards compatibility.
And I'm not entirely sure it *is* equivalent to chown root/chmod u+x -
that is how /mnt/accessfs/net/ipv4/bind appeared and my named couldn't
bind to 921.
