OK, I fixed the graphs so you can actually read them now ;-)

Both seems significantly slower on -mm (mm is green line)
If I look at diffprofile between 2.6.15 and 2.6.15-mm1, it just looks
like we have lots more idle time. You got strange scheduler changes in
there, that you've been carrying for a long time (2.6.14-mm1 at least)? 
or HZ piddling? See to be mainly getting much more idle time.
