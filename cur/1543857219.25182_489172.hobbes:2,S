Wrong. Your ll/sc implementation with cmpxchg is buggy. The cmpxchg
load_locked is not locked at all, and there can be interleaving writes
between the load and cmpxchg which do not cause the store_conditional
to fail.
It might be reasonable to implement this watered down version, but:
don't some architectures have restrictions on what instructions can
be issued between the ll and the sc?
But in general I agree with you, in that a higher level primitive is
preferable (eg. atomic_add_unless).
