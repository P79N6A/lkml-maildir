yes, I was talking about vm_cache_scan_ratio, you can combine the two
sysctl together just fine.

The less pages are scanned, the more likely you won't free enough
pagecache, the more likely you'll shrink dcache/icache.
I see why vm_mapped_ratio makes most of the difference though and
probably it's the easier fix for your problem (though increasing
vm_cache_scan_ratio sure won't make things worse).
