You should be able to delete a container with rmdir as long as it's
not in use - its control files will get cleaned up automatically.
If you're getting an EBUSY error that means that either there are
still tasks running in the container (look in the "tasks" file) or
else there's a reference counting bug somewhere.
Can you post an example to reproduce the problem?
