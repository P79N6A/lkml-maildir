ACPI is required just not for identifying the DMA remapping hardware in the
system. We also need them to identify which engines control which pci devices.
Also there are some reserved sections that BIOS uses for its purpose that it
needs identity map.. say for legacy emulation via usb etc that needs
to be passed to the OS. 
not sure we can get away from using ACPI that easily.. its just only for setup
information, once the identification is complete we dont bother ACPI anymore.
