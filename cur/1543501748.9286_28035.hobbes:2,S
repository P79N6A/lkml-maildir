ptrace is basically an upcall.  A personality might or might not be
something that should be used.  It is possible to support both types
of syscalls at the same time.
Performance-wise I don't think you'll loose much.  The
performance-degradation due to TLB or cache-misses are probably very
low.  It would use some slots in a jump-cache which might have some
effect.
An optimization would be to use the same mechanism, but have the
default "invocation page" exported by the kernel binary patch the
invocation point to do a int 0x80 directly.
