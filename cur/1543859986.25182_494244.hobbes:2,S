What advantage do we use a set of ioctl's compared to sysfs?
I think that sysfs is easier and more readable than the ioctl's 
to change configurations(IP address and port number and so on).
ex)
# cat /sys/class/misc/netconsole/port1/remote_ip
192.168.0.1
# echo 172.16.0.1 > /sys/class/misc/netconsole/port1/remote_ip
# cat /sys/class/misc/netconsole/port1/remote_ip
172.16.0.1
And the sysfs doesn't need to create access program such as the ioctl's.
If you change configurations related to netconsole through the sysfs interface, 
a simple script file including a set of commands such as above echo 
will help you set up automatically.

I would like to implement handling IPV6 on demand in the future.

I think a userland application would rather find target MAC address and 
change it through the sysfs.
