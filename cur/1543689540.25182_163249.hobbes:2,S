As a matter of fact, yes. Their (expensive) developer kits have SOME
examples. Of course, much of the information you need for any sort of
driver that is just a weensie bit strange is completely missing. It
makes a specialized USB serial port to MIDI driver very difficult to
build and even worse to deploy neatly without a lot of user interaction.
