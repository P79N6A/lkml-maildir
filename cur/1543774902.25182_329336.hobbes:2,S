I was thinking it would look more like:
 	read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
 	p = find_task_by_pid(pid);
 	get_task_struct(p);
 	read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
	...
	spin_lock_irq(&p->sighand->siglock);
	...
I am not sure whether such code exists or not.  It won't look quite like
that, in that the siglock use may be far away from the extraction.  There
are things that store pointers like that (like real_timer.data, and
posix_timers stuff).  But it may well be that all those places take
tasklist_lock before using the saved task_struct, in which case it's fine.
(Anything doing signals stuff usually needs tasklist_lock anyway in case it
has to traverse the thread group.)

You mean those are the files that use all three of those, or what?  That's
clearly not the complete list of siglock uses.  Any code using siglock
needs to be grokked adequately to see if tasklist_lock is always held
around looking at ->sighand.
Thanks,
