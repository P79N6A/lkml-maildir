Subject: [PATCH 0/14] UML - Get rid of tt mode
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This set of patches is 2.6.24 material.
It throws out tt mode, which has been non-functional for a while.
This is done in phases, interspersed with code cleanups on the
affected files.
The removal is done as follows:
	remove all code, config options, and files which depend on
CONFIG_MODE_TT
	get rid of the CHOOSE_MODE macro, which decided whether to
call tt-mode or skas-mode code, and replace invocations with their
skas portions
	replace all now-trivial procedures with their skas equivalents
There are now a bunch of now-redundant pieces of data structures,
including mode-specific pieces of the thread structure, pt_regs, and
mm_context.  These are all replaced with their skas-specific contents.
As part of the ongoing style compliance project, I made a style pass
over all files that were changed.  There are three such patches, one
for each phase, covering the files affected by that phase but no later
ones.
I noticed that we weren't freeing the LDT state associated with a
process when it exited, so that's fixed in one of the later patches.
The last patch is a tidying patch which I've had for a while, but
which caused inexplicable crashes under tt mode.  Since that is no
longer a problem, this can now go in.
