These macros refer to their arg more than one time and hance are dangerous.
Think of the effects of PDC_RX_BUF(foo++).
Generally, please don't use macros for anything which can be coded as a
regular C function.

Maybe this should be a uart_circ_whatever() helper rather than open-coded.

ho-hum.  The generic uart buffer-handling code does ringbuffers the wrong
way.  Maybe it has to handle non-power-of-two buffer sizes.

Doesn't uart_circ_chars_pending() do this?
All those uart_circ_*() macros reference their arg more than once and ... 
you know the deal.
