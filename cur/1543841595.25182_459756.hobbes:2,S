Thanks for the answers. :)
There is also a HP Deskjet 5652 attached to the card which is
recognized correctly and works just fine, as long as I do not insert
any USB storage device. Of course the printer is just a USB 1.1 device.
So I've tried without the ehci_hcd module loaded and everything seemed
to work as it should. (Well, sorry for not trying this earlier.) So, at
least the UHCI part seems to work as long as there are no EHCI
'functions' involved.
I'll try to get a new adaptor card then. 
Greets,
