Fair enough, however by hard coding a lot of new pointers and links everywhere 
you are making the task unnecessarily more difficult for the person who 
*does* want to look at the filesystem point of view. Please could you at 
least hide the details of the location of all these elements in 
macros/inlined functions.
IOW: if you could write something like
   x = current_fsuid();
   set_current_euid(y);
instead of
   x = current->cred->fsuid;
  current->cred->euid = y;
then this would make a later transition to current->cred->ucred a lot easier. 
In addition, it might also make it possible to share future code with 2.4.x 
via a set of compatibility routines.
Cheers,
