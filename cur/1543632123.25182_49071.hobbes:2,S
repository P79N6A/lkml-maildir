Since you are playing in this area, I wonder if you would consider doing 
something that has been needed for a while:
Individual CPU selection.
This implies separating the concept of a "generic x86 kernel that 
supports N CPU types" from "kernel supports one CPU type and one only." 
 The i386/config.in is currently a mishmash of both.  Dave Jones did 
some work along these lines in his "cpuchoice" diff, which I have attached.
Basically, the general direction IMO should be:  a user can select the 
CPU they own (Pentium-II), and none of the options for Pentium 
3/4/Athlon will be enabled.  Generic kernels would ask for a minimal CPU 
level to support, I imagine.  Support >=486, >=586, etc.  Pretty much 
what we have now.
