I'm going to regret suggesting this, but how about:
(a) a typedef for the arg itself
(b) a macro and/or inline for the type update
both simultaneously?
So we'd have centralized in one place:
#if /* kernel version > 2.6.0 */
typdef int *third_arg_t;
#define third_arg_update(type)	do { *(type) = VM_FAULT_MINOR; } while (0)
#else
typdef int third_arg_t;
#define third_arg_update(type)	do { } while (0)
#endif
... and the natural usage that follows.
