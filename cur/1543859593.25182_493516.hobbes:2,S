Ok, I see what you are getting at. The current ->end_io() is called when
the request has fully completed, you want notification for each chunk
potentially completed.
I think a better design here would be to use ->end_io() as the full
completion handler, similar to how bio->bi_end_io() works. A request
originating from __make_request() would set something ala:
int fs_end_io(struct request *rq, int error, unsigned int nr_bytes)
{
        if (!__end_that_request_first(rq, err, nr_bytes)) {
                end_that_request_last(rq, error);
                return 0;
        }
        return 1;
}
and normal io completion from a driver would use a helper:
int blk_complete_io(struct request *rq, int error, unsigned int nr_bytes)
{
        return rq->end_io(rq, error, nr_bytes);
}
instead of calling the functions manually. That would allow you to get
notification right at the beginning and do what you need, without adding
a special hook for this.
When designing these things, never be afraid to change some of the core
bits. It is a lot better than hacking around the current code, if it
doesn't quite fit your needs.
