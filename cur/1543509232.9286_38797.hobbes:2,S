ok, for the past few months i've been baffled.
this workstation is abhorently slow.  mouse moves, keyboard typing, etc. 
lagged, jerky, dropped actions, etc.
i put 2.3.18 on today to see if there was any better performance.
sequence of events:
- boot
- five minutes pass with no activity
- i log in and cat /proc/interrupts
lo and behold:
# cat /proc/interrupts

_wow_
nearly a million per cpu per minute.  now the question.  why?

there isn't any disk seeking happening.  the heads are silent.  there is an
onboard adaptec which gave the same symptoms.  it was disabled and the above
card was installed.
if anyone has any ideas, feel free to inform me.  further information avail
upon request.
