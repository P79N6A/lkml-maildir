I was unsure how to handle this and decided to stick with the style of 
each file for now as I wanted the patch to be minimally intrusive.
I.e., if the file had forward declarations right in front of their use, I 
did it that way. If it had them at the top (or didn't have any, but I 
might have decided wrong on some of these), I put them there.
BTW this mostly came up within architecure specific files and was similar 
for each arch, so it seems to reflect their maintainers taste...

Sure.
But it will take some days as I feel quite exhausted from getting the 
previous patch to work and want to reserve my spare time for any problems 
these patches bring up.
Thanks for your advice!
