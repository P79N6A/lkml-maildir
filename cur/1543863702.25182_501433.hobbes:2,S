Sorry, I've been siliently keeping your suggested change in my private
repo without announcing it to the world. I'll reply to the old email in
another message at length.

I'll look into it. I've been focused on clean up and a couple of other
things regard the stability of this patch. Making small changes in it
tends to make the kernel crash hard and I suspect that it's an interaction
problem with lockdep and that I need to turn lockdep off when hitting
"lock stats" locks. I'm going to move to "__raw_..." locks...
Meanwhile please wait until I hand interpret and merge your changes to an
older patch into my latest stuff. If it's takes too long, I suggest keeping
out of the tree for a bit until I finish this round unless something is
pressing for this to happen now like a mass change to the spinlock macros
or something. I stalled a bit trying to get Peter Zijlstra an extra feature.

I'll look into it. Not sure what your choice in style is here and I'm
open to suggestions. I'm also interested in a reduction of #define
identifier length if you or somebody else has some kind of good convention
to suggest.

Sorry, for the lag. Trying to juggle this and the current demands of my
employeer contributed to this lag unfortunately.
