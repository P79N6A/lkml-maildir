Then there's another question: when deciding whether you can issue
another TCQ-read, do you compare the number of outstanding TCQ-reads
against the TCQ-read limit, or compare the _total_ number of
outstanding TCQs against the TCQ-read limit?  Similarly for writes.
There are several other logical combinations that could be used.
Each condition will have a different effect on mean and peak latencies
under different load patterns.  I'm not sure which makes more sense,
or even if multiple conditions should be used together.
