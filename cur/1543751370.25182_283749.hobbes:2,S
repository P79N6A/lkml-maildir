Well, it seems I was able to reproduce it each and every time by trying
to read the one sector.  The drive is now out of the box but I can place
it in my desktop or anywhere else and probably do the same.
I can't seem to find a post with the SGI fixes, and I don't see anything
from a quick skim of the bk8 and bk9 logs (problem reproduced in bk7). 
Could you point me to the relevant thread?
