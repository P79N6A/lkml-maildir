This is your lucky day... :-)
I have a fully working lofs and more for linux 2.0/2.1/2.2.  Ion and I used
lofs as a starting point for wrapfs: a template stackable f/s that makes it
easier to write stackable f/s for linux.  Small kernel changes are needed,
and we hope to be able to contribute this code into the main linux kernel
sometime.
Ion and I also wrote several other file systems based on wrapfs: cryptfs
(encryption f/s) and usenetfs (optimize performance of large article
directories.)  Software and papers on for these can be found in
