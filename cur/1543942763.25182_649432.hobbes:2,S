Can you send me the output of 'tree /sys/block/' on 2.6.24?
Are there a lot of partitions here?  Anything different you can think of
from x86 that I can have a chance to try to narrow things down with?  :)
I don't know if you can boot without udev, but if you could, can you
send the 'tree' output of the offending kernel too?
