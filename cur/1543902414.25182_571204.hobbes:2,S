I've posted patches.  I'll post more in the near future since we decided 
to make some rather drastic changes.  With the new patchset, guest's 
will use vmcall directly with a couple bytes of padding.  The hypervisor 
may or may not patch the calling site to use something different (like 
vmmcall).

Within the kernel right (VMCALL is only usable in ring 1).  Is it 
terribly important to be able to pass through the syscall arguments in 
registers verses packing them in a data structure and passing a pointer 
to that structure?
