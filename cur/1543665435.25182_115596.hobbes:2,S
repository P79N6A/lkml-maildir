	Yeah, I was chatting with Peter about that last night (he was
advocating 64 bits for dev_t).  For some things (NFSv2) we could merely
truncate the space.  It only really matters if /dev is on NFS, and we
can perhaps say "You need NFSv3 or better if you want the larger dev
space".  That's just one possible way to approach it.  A system big
enough to have 5000 disks attached likely isn't getting /dev from an
NFSv2 server.
	I'm so-so on the 64bit vs 32bit dev_t argument, but I'd bet we
only want to change it once for the internal representation.  How we
handle external representations (on disk, over the wire) is a different
matter.
