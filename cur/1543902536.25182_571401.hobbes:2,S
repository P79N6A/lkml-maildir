I like the proposal. The advantage over exporting the needed
information from the kernel directly is that makedumpfile (and the
contents of the mkdfinfo file [1]) can be changed without changing the
kernel which simplifies maintenance.
If now everybody agrees that this is the way to go, I can also offer
to implement the kernel and kexec userspace utility part
implementation of that stuff.
Maybe we should wait until Simon Horman is back here as he's the
current maintainer of kexec-tools(-testing).
Thanks,
   Bernhard
[1] didn't we agree to vmcoreinfo?
