The Linux Test Project test suite <
http://www.linuxtestproject.org
> has
been released. The latest version of the testsuite contains 2000+ tests for
the Linux OS. Our web site also contains other information such as: test
results, a Linux test tools matrix, an area for keeping up with fixes for
known blocking problems in the 2.5/2.6 kernel releases, technical papers
and HowTos on Linux testing, and a code coverage analysis tool.
 Highlights:
   * Updated the LTP stress script to record 'iostat' statistics if
     needed.
   * Updated the SCTP tests to support the current SCTP 2.6 kernel code.
   * Added new NFS test, nfs04, to help test data integrity during copies
     across mounts.
   * Applied more bug fixes, patches, and code cleanups.
 We encourage the community to post results, patches or new tests on our
 mailing list <ltp-list@lists.sf.net> and use the CVS bug tracking facility
 to report problems that you might encounter with the test suite.
 See ChangeLog below.
