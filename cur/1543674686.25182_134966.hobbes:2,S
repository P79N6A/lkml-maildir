Exactly -- allows a ->nopage() to drop some lock to avoid races
between pagefault and either vmtruncate() or invalidate_mmap_range().
This race (from the cross-host mmap viewpoint) is described in:
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105286345316249&w=2
install_new_page() has to drop mm->page_table_lock() for the same
reason that the previous do_no_page() did.  In addition, dropping
the lock permits a ->nopage() to invoke things like zap_page_range()
which acquire mm->page_table_lock().
						Thanx, Paul
