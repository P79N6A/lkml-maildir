Hi
For short delays in threads, earlier one was able to use 
current->timeout = x;
current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
schedule();
current->timeout = 0;
in 2.2.5 kernel looks like this field has disappeared. should we have to do
the 
queue on wait task and use wakeup from timer to do this now?
Cheers,
ashokr
