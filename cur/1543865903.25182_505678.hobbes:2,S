Perhaps this is because there is a lacking keyword. The depends controls 
visibility, perhaps a "requires" could be used to provide advisory 
information which mean "these other things will be turned on if you 
build this feature."

I think depends and select provide this now, the postulated "requires" 
might make building the trees easier.
