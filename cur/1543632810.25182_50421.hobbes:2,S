Good point.  Quake deathmatch is another place where you worry a lot

Not at all.  You can still run a web browser and a download in parallel
with the realtime process, that's the beauty of it.  As for the realtime
gui, if you're determined to build one it doesn't have to be the whole
desktop.  It can just be one window, much like a video overlay.
I'm don't see any fundamental roadblock here.

That doesn't follow.  I ought to be able to do an apt-get dist-upgrade
without the realtime application ever skipping a beat, just to pick one
example off the top of the pile.

If it hurts, don't do that.  I thought we'd invoked the concept of a
realtime filesystem?  You can log to that, and you ought to be able to
run queries against it in non-realtime.  You don't have to suck the
entire world into your realtime application.

This is precisely the sort of design limitation we're tearing down with
these hybrid realtime/non-realtime systems.  Your mistake is assuming
that every form of communication between the two has to be tightly
coupled.  It's true that the entire realtime system has to operate
within the strictures of some formalism, but that's what formalisms
are for.  It's no more shocking a limitation than the fact that regular
users aren't allowed to do all the things the superuser can do.
