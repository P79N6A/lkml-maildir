Ext4 will support a 48-bit blocknumber format for extents, but I do
want to make ext4 suitable as a general purpose filesystem, and 32-bit
systems will be around for I fear far longer than people might wish.
So while I agree that we shouldn't go _too_ far out of our way to make
things efficient on 32-bit systems, if it's not that much work to
support a 32-bit sector_t, we ought to do it.
So how about a compromise?  We allow for a 32-bit sector_t in ext4,
but we drop the SECTOR_FMT, and rely on %llu and typecasts in
printk's.  Then the only other extra hair in the filesystem code will
be a mount-time check to make sure we don't try to mount a large
filesystem on system with a 32-bit sector_t.
