Yes, the hardware in the modem can do it for sure. I have a laptop
with a pentium4 CPU, USB2.0, windows XP installed. I attach the same
modem to this laptop and I can go up to 730..740 kbyte/s (the same
phone line of course). Windows XP had to be modified with a registry
tweak (from thomson website) to switch to isochronous mode and it
works.
However my server running linux is on a ECS motherboard (P6BAP as I
remember), Celeron 633 CPU, USB1.1. I have compiled quite fresh kernel
2.6.21.5
I am 100% sure that I use the same firmware for the modem, because I
copied it directly from windows XP from laptop.
Now since the modem itself can go as fast as 6mbit/s, I am only
concerned if the _computer_ hardware on my linux server box can do it
via USB ? I can see the usb reporting it to be at 12Mbit/s, which
should be enough to reach 6mbit/s teoretically. CPU load is normal
even during transfers.
I would have to install windows xp on that machine to be 100% sure
that both modem and computer hardware can go up to 6mbit/s via USB...
By the way, I just tried to switch sw_buffering in the speedtch module
but that did not help.
