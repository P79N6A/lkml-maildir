That I understand fully.
My question arises because I have 3 SA-110 results which report "cache
not coherent".  They do not report "store buffer not coherent".  All 3
are Rebel Netwinders, of different bogomips ratings.
The point is: those results _don't_ indicate write buffer problems.
It means that your VIVT explanation and workaround does not explain
those results, so I cannot have confidence that your workaround fixes
those particular ARM devices.
Now, if you can assure me that those results are _definitely_ due to
using very old kernels which don't even mark pages uncacheable, and
with newer kernels those Netwinders would exhibit coherent virtual
aliases, that's great.
Then I'll say that ARM Linux offers coherent virtual aliases on all
known ARM systems, provided they're running a sufficiently new kernel.
Otherwise, I can't say that.
