To get somewhat back on track: volume and brightness (and similar - lid 
close etc) events clearly are keypresses.
However, I would also argue that a keypress that is acted on by the 
firmware automatically is *different* from a keypress that hasn't been 
acted on: one is a "key was pressed *and* hardware did something 
automatically", and the other is just a "key was pressed" event.
IOW, I think the thinkpad issue (and others like it) should be fixed by 
splitting up the KEY_VOLUMEUP "key" into separate KEY_VOLUMEUP and 
KEY_VOLUMEUP_NOTIFY key events, so that downstream user mode (and the 
kernel itself, for that matter) can know whether it's a informational 
message or whether it should be acted upon.
Because clearly we seem to have both cases, and while I think we should 
try to move towards a "user mode does all actions" model where screen 
brightness is under the control of X, that isn't necessarily the case now, 
nor perhaps even reachable on all hw platforms.
Hmm?
