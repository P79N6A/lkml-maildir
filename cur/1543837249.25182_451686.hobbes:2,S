Hi folks.
I am looking for a way to map a memory (allocated with get_free_pages()) 
from kernel space to user space, so that I will later be able to map it 
back with get_user_pages().
I tried remap_pfn_range(), but it didn't work as it assumes the memory 
being mapped is IO range (marking vma with VM_IO flag), while 
get_user_pages() works on regular memory.
Any ideas?
Thanks.
Alexander Sandler.
