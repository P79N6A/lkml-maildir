As we discussed with Alan on irc, we could remove the (physical)
swapin_readahead() and get 2.4 stable. Once 2.4 is stable we
could (if needed) introduce a virtual address based readahead
strategy for swap-backed things ... most of that code has been
ready for months thanks to Ben LaHaise.
A virtual-address based readahead not only makes much more sense
from a performance POV, it also cleanly gets the ugly locking
issues out of the way.
regards,
Rik
