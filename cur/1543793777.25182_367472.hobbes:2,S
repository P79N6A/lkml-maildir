hmm, yes, when floppy_open() does its test we haven't yet gone and
determined the state of FD_DISK_WRITABLE.  On later opens, we have done, so
things work OK.
We may be able to do the test at the end of floppy_open(), after
check_disk_change() has called floppy_revalidate().  But for O_NDELAY opens
we appear to be screwed.
