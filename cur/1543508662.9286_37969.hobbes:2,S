I put that there..........
DANGEROUS means that what is known about the registers is EXPERIMENTAL
grade; however, if one tampers with this area without knowing something
about it.....You can "goat screw yourself".
Specifically, I have basic knowledge of the RAID/STRIPING powers of the
Promise FastTrak series.  This was learned on imperical tests and crashes.
Unless you have several drives of the same kind to wreck, and run a mirror
backup copy.  It is not suggested.
It is IMO that "DANGEROUS" is much nicer than "SCREW YOURSELF CAREFULLY".
Also that only appears in the "DEVELOPMENT KERNEL" or a patch of my that
is back-coded from there; therefore, "DANGEROUS" is acceptable in that
context.  Do you see something like this in the "STABLE KERNEL", no.
