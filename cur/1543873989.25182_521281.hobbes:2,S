Yeah. I actually thought about this whole issue a bit more recently - 
things like SATA/PATA interference when you've got a part that emulates 
legacy functionality so can appear as two different kinds of device - 
since I don't think my brain was really bothering to listen before. 
Words were going in, but it chose to ignore what was being said.
Only thing that comes to mind is in-driver logic/driver loading ordering 
hack combinations. At least if you've got loadable modules, you've got a 
fighting chance of fixing this kind of situation - built-in and you need 
to fight with whatever ordering exists in the array of init functions.
Jon.
P.S. Guess this means I need to admit I was wrong and apologize to 
Zaitcev sometime too in relation to another discussion...bah :P
