Hem ... they're about 100 lines of code and they rapresent a complete I/O
dispatching engine. And yes, like you could guess from the source code,
the same skeleton was used, with different event retrieval methods, to
test poll() , rt-sig , /dev/poll and /dev/epoll. And, as I said in the
previous email, you could have implemented an I/O driven state machine. I
personally like a little bit more coroutines, that the reason of such
implementation.
