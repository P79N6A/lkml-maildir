Well this stuff looks pretty nice (although I'm not sure whether the
softirq->thread changes are a good idea for performance, I guess we'll
see).
You still don't have the option that the Intel patch gave, that is,
to submit on the completer. I guess that you could do it somewhat
generically by having a cpuid in the request queue, and update that
with the completing cpu.
At least they reported it to be the most efficient scheme in their
testing, and Dave thought that migrating completions out to submitters
might be a bottleneck in some cases.
