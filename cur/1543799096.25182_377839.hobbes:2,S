Thanks for the feedback. I'm working on fixing up a few things and
getting an updated set of patches out, so your timing's not bad at all.

I had something similar in my initial design, the I/OAT DMA engine can
operate on any memory mapped region "downstream" from the PCI device.
That's easy enough to add to the API, and then flush out the device
matching code in the ioatdma driver later.

We were trying to not share them for simplicity.  But with the way we
ended up using the DMA engine for TCP, we needed to get the locking
right for requests from multiple threads anyway.  Shared channel use
shouldn't be hard to add, I'll look into it.

Any ideas of what this would look like?

We tossed the async in after an early comment that the dma namespace
wasn't unique enough, especially with the DMA mapping APIs already in
place.  Maybe hwdma?  I'm open to suggestions.

You're right.  That file started out with dma_skb_copy_datagram_iovec,
and dma_memcpy_[pg_]toiovec were created to support that.  Anything not
specifically tied to sk_buffs should be moved.
