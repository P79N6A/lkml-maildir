I admit I do not know scsi stack but I would expect that the only
things that need dev_t there would be sd, sr and sg interfaces. As
such they are separate entities and "deserve" their own structures no
mater what.
I can bet that number of real devices that need dev_t is smaller than
number of virtual devices that do not need full power management:
PCI cards, ACPI tree, etc, etc - hardware devices interfacing with
other parts of the kernel, not userspace directly.
NET, input, tty, etc - no need to suspend late/resume early
And, btw, having separate device and struct device does not prevent
exporting them as a unified sysfs tree and is in fact pretty easy to
do (I believe I posted patches to do that as well).
