Ok, I think I've managed to reproduce this and show that it's not a
case of calling syscalls with interrupt disabled.
There's a utility called savetextmode that's part of svgalib (apt-get
svgalib-bin for Debian folks). If you configure it to use VESA, it
will call out to your video card bios and reproduce the error, just as
I expected.
I had kgdb handy and already running on a machine, so I set a
breakpoint in sys_vm86old (X would use sys_vm86, but the results would
be the same) and traced into it. About the first thing it does is call
copy_from_user, which checks might_sleep, which remained silent.
