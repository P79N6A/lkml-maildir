Subject: [RFC] ext3/jbd race: releasing in-use journal_heads

Hi all,
For the past few months there has been a slow but steady trickle of
reports of oopses in kjournald.  Recently I got a couple of reports that
were repeatable enough to rerun with extra debugging code.
It turns out that we're releasing a journal_head while it is still
linked onto the transaction's t_locked_list.  The exact location is in
journal_unmap_buffer().  On several exit paths, that does:
		spin_unlock(&journal->j_list_lock); 
		jbd_unlock_bh_state(bh);
		spin_unlock(&journal->j_state_lock);
		journal_put_journal_head(jh);
releasing the jh *after* dropping the j_list_lock and j_state_lock.
kjournald can then be doing journal_commit_transaction():
	spin_lock(&journal->j_list_lock);
...
		if (buffer_locked(bh)) {
			BUFFER_TRACE(bh, "locked");
			if (!inverted_lock(journal, bh))
				goto write_out_data;
			__journal_unfile_buffer(jh);
			__journal_file_buffer(jh, commit_transaction,
						BJ_Locked);
			jbd_unlock_bh_state(bh);
The problem happens if journal_unmap_buffer()'s own put_journal_head()
manages to get in between kjournald's *unfile_buffer and the following
*file_buffer.  Because journal_unmap_buffer() has dropped its bh_state
lock by this point, there's nothing to prevent this, leading to a
variety of unpleasant situations.  In particular, the jh is unfiled at
this point, so there's nothing to stop the put_journal_head() from
freeing the memory we're just about to link onto the BJ_Locked list.
I _think_ that the attached patch deals with this, but I'm still
awaiting further testing to be sure.  I thought I might as well get some
other ext3 eyes on it while I wait for that -- I'll let you know as soon
as I hear back from the other testing.
The patch works by making sure that the various exits from
journal_unmap_buffer() always call journal_put_journal_head() *before*
unlocking the j_list_lock.  This is correct according to the documented
lock ranking, and it also matches the order in the existing main exit
path at the end of the function.
Cheers,
  Stephen
