Do we need to actually need to respect may_create() in
container_clone()? I guess it would provide a way for root to control
which processes could unshare namespaces.

I was thinking that it would be nice to be able to atomically set up
the resources in the new container at the point when it's created
rather than later. But I guess this way can work too. Can we call it
something like "clone()" rather than "auto_setup()"?
