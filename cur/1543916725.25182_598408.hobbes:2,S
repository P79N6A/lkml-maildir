How much memory did you have in "cached" when you looked
with top (and no swap enabled) ?
If the amount of "cached" memory is very low, it could mean
that your shared libraries are being pushed out of memory,
instead of the kernel swapping out some page that belongs to
only one process.
As for kswapd getting into uninterruptible sleep state, it
will do that all by itself sometimes, without even having
any disk IO going on... that code looks a little suspect,
I will look into it.
