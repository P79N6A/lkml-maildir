Hi.
The bridge-nf code does not use recursive function calls and there is no
long consecutive function calling. Furthermore, there is no function in
the bridge-nf code that uses a large part of the stack.
Andi, if you make such statements then please point out the code part
you have (of course) read after which you decided to make the statement.
The bridge-nf code is used by quite a few people and by commercial
companies and I have never had a report like this. AMD has been having
all sorts of strange problems for weeks now, they're all somehow related
to bridge-nf, but I doubt he is using the bridge-nf patch on a clean 2.4
kernel.
AMD, is there any chance you can use the latest 2.6 kernel, without
extra patches ?
