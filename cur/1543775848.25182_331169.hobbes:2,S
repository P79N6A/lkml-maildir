Sorry Russel,
what kind of patches ? As I was trying to explain I've tried 2 diffent
distros with many different kernel versions (2.6.11-4, 2.6.11-7 and
2.6.12) and on all the combinations the mouse doesn't work. did you
have a look at the dmesg snapshot?
What about that? are the boot messages correct?
Thanks in advance,
regards,
 Davide
