You can read www.namesys.com for a description of reiser4, and 
www.namesys.com/benchmarks.html for some benchmarks.
There are no well done independent benchmarks unfortunately.
Of my competitors, and not considering ReiserFS (about which I am not 
objective), I would say that if you don't have really large files and 
don't have any large directories, ext3 offers the best performance.
If you have large streaming files, look at XFS.   Don't use XFS for 
files smaller than 100k, as the last time I tested against it its 
metadata updates tended to be slow, and that starts to matter at <100k 
file sizes.
JFS has never done very well in the benchmarks I run, which is why I 
tend to compare us mostly to ext3.
If you are willing to consider ReiserFS, V3 is the journaling filesystem 
that has been out for the longest, and receives the least updates (we 
are all working on V4), so it is the most stable.  I'll let others 
comment on its performance.
V4 is far higher performance than V3, but not quite fully stable yet.  
Some brave people are using it though.  Hopefully we will ship something 
stable this month.
