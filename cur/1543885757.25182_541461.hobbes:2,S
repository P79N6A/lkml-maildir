The krealloc() API has been in current git for few days now. I suggested 
it because I thought it would nicely fold the kfree() + kzalloc() pair 
into a simple krealloc() call but the error handling makes it a total 
mess. I think we need kzrealloc() in the kernel... ;-)
So please simply ignore my comment.
