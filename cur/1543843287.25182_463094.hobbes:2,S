I agree that the difference is annoying.
However I just wrote a user space implementation of fork that
is capable of copying a process from an i386 only kernel to a x86_64
kernel, and executing there without having to detect the kernel type.
It didn't takes hacks to accomplish that.
The basic syscall is:
int set_thread_area (struct user_desc *u_info);
struct user_desc {
	unsigned int  entry_number;
	unsigned long base_addr;
	unsigned int  limit;
	unsigned int  seg_32bit:1;
	unsigned int  contents:2;
	unsigned int  read_exec_only:1;
	unsigned int  limit_in_pages:1;
	unsigned int  seg_not_present:1;
	unsigned int  useable:1;
};
If entry_number is -1 the kernel finds a free gdt entry and
sets up the segment and returns with entry_number set to the
segment number.
