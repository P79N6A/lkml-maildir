The vulnerabilities were discussed on US news reports as being
like somebody discovered they could disconnect your electricity
if they had some wire-cutters.
Those guys in the UK just don't have anything else to do! It
seems that they discovered that if you tap-into some network
physical media you could disrupt it! Since it has been taking
so long for IP/V6 to take hold, those proponents claim that
it will be a solution. Me-thinks it's a solution waiting for
a problem. The IP/V6 folks want to force (using government and
industry FUD) to discontinue IP/V4 as a "security risk!!!"
