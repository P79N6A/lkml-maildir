Just as a minor point: pro64 _does_ use GCC code. It's effectively the GCC
frontend stuck together with the SGI backend, with a translation layer in
the middle to translate between the intermediate code formats that the two
compilers use. There are some fairly entertaining "this is a gruesome hack"
comments in the source code.
