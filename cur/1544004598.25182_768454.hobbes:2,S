If not in radix-tree, it's not tracked.
(But we don't want to track non-LRU pages which are not freeable.)

Hmm, current mem cgroup works via page_cgroup struct to track pages.
   page <-> page_cgroup has one-to-one relation ship.
So, "exchanging page" itself causes trouble. But I may be able to provide
necessary hooks to you as I did in page migraiton.

Ok, thank you for confirmation.

If KSM pages are on radix-tree, it will be accounted automatically.
Now, we have "Unevictable" LRU and mlocked() pages are smartly isolated into its
own LRU. So, just doing
 - inode's radix-tree
 - make all pages mlocked.
 - provide special page fault handler for your purpose
is simple one. But ok, whatever implementation you'll do, I have to check it
and consider whether it should be tracked or not. Then, add codes to memcg to
track it or ignore it or comments on your patches ;)
It's helpful to add me to CC: when you post this set again.
