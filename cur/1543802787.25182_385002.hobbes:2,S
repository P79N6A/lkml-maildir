This is supposed to fix the incarnation of that as a preexisting
problem, but you're right, there is no fallback or retry for the case
of hugepage queue exhaustion. For some reason I saw a phantom page
allocator fallback in the hugepage allocator changes.
Looks like back to the drawing board for this pair of patches, though
I'd be more than happy to get a solution to this.
