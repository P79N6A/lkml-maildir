Subject: [RFC,PATCH 0/2] Oprofile-on-Cell prereqs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are two patches that provide some prerequisites for the upcoming 
Oprofile-on-Cell patches, which Maynard Johnson will be posting.
These patches are against the 2.6.18-arnd5 tree.
1. cbe_pmu_interrupts.diff
Add routines for managing the Cell PMU interrupts.
The following routines are added to arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/pmu.c:
 cbe_clear_pm_interrupts()
 cbe_enable_pm_interrupts()
 cbe_disable_pm_interrupts()
 cbe_query_pm_interrupts()
 pm_init_IRQ()
This also adds two routines to arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/interrupt.c
to manipulate the IIC_IS and IIC_IR registers:
 iic_clear_pmi_interrupt()
 iic_set_interrupt_routing()
We are still working on how to clean up cbe_clear_pm_interrupts() and
cbe_enable_pm_interrupts() so we hopefully won't need to call the
iic_ routines (and also not need the additions to interrupt.c).
2. export_hrtimer_forward.diff
Add a symbol-export for kernel/hrtimer.c::hrtimer_forward(). This routine
is needed by the upcoming Oprofile-for-Cell patches, since Oprofile can
be built as a module.
