I've been tracking this down for quite some time now.  What I have observed
thus far leads me to believe the following:
When Linux 2.2 sends to some host X, and X is a fast receiver (so the perceived
receive window remains large in Linux's eyes), then the TCP/IP transfer (as
observed with tcpdump) is nearly textbook.
But!  When host X is slower than the sending Linux 2.2, or the medium between
them is slow (e.g. a ppp link), such that data buffers on the sending side,
then Linux will sometimes forget to send a packet.  For example, the sequence
numbers coming from Linux for a fictitious mtu-500 connection look like 1-500,
501-1000, 1501-2000, 2001-2500, and so on; whoops, where did 1001-1500 go?  I
have tcpdump output from *both* ends of such a connection showing this
happening; it is very repeatable.  Making matters worse, a slow medium (e.g.
ppp) makes it take quite awhile before the ACK stream from X back to Linux gets
linux's TCP stream back to the missed sequence.  This explains why, when
running a ppp dialup server with linux 2.0, I get >33Kbps transfer rates;
booting Linux 2.2, the transfer rates drop to 15Kbps or thereabouts (with no
lost bytes or other serial misshaps).
