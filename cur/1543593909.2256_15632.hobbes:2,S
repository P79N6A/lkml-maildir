I had an interesting discussion with my brother-in-law at this
weekend: What is source code?
In my (very much younger days), I used to hack in 8085 and Z80
assembler and even hex codes directly onto the disk / files using all
those scary tools like DDT and M80/L80 under CP/M (those were the days
when Microsoft tools were really bleeding edge. ;-) )
What if there is really a warbled indivdual that can write a driver in
object code? Or at least in x86 assembler and then performs the magic
necessary to link it into the kernel?
Is this a "binary only" driver or just a driver on par with the NVidia
that is just "GPL'ed but unreadable"?
	Regards
