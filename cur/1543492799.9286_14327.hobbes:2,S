It's not a rule, it's a general guideline for if you don't know how much swap 
you want.  It's expected that as people gain experience with setting up and
running Linux systems, they'll figure out the best swap allocation strategy
for their systems; the amount of swap required depends on both applications
and usage patterns, and there is no such thing as a hard and fast rule or
formula to determine swap space.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
