Hi,
I found this another Asus laptop with intel chipset which also has
problems with the latest ACPI code, and I tried the same trick on my
machine, and now the machine boots again! 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3191
I have no clue what I'm actually doing so please don't consider the
patch a fix for the problem, but rather a way do show how to make the
symptom go away.
