I'm sorry to hear that.  If you really do want to try out an Itanium 2
system, an easy way to go about it is to get an account at
http://testdrive.hp.com/
 .  It's a quick and painless process and a
single account will give you access to all test-drive machines,
including various Linux Itanium machines (up to 4x 1.4GHz),
