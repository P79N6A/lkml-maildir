Hi
Is anyone currently working on adding support to 2.2.x (or for
2.3.x/2.4) for ISL encapsulation?  This would be an incredibly useful
feature to the networking code.
At one time there was a patch to add support for it to 2.0.33, but I've
seen no updates, nor can find any information besides this one patch. 
Requests sent to the authors last known email have gone unanswered.  
I spent a day trying to port the patch to 2.2.13 but it failed due to
many changes in the networking code and some overlapped defines
(specifically, packet length calculations, #define IFF_ISL 0x4000,
etc).  I suppose if I knew the networking code better it would have
helped. =) 
If anyone is interested in the old patch for study, etc, I can post if
needed.  TIA, and happy holidays or "I hope your shopping is easy"...
which ever you prefer.  =)
