You mean, for example,
bee13000-bee2c000 rw-s 00000000 00:05 7405782    /SYSVa8020046 (deleted)
?
It's not the memory which has been "(deleted)", that's still filling your
virtual address space.  It means that shared memory objects /SYSVxxxxxxxx
are not really there on your filesystem, and so are displayed as deleted:
an mmapping of an unlinked file is shown that way.
