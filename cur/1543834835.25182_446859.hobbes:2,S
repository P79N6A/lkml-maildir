Sorry if this was wrong, it wasn't meant against you personally.
Things do go wrong. That's life.
And you aren't the first person who sent a patch that broke the 
compilation of the next -stable kernel.
The real problem is:
How do we get some testing coverage of -stable kernels by users to catch 
issues?
And compile errors are the least of my worries.
