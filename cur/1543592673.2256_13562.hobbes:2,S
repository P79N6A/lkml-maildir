When a task wants to exit, it cleans up all its stuff,
sets its state to TASK_ZOMBIE and then calls schedule().
The scheduler takes it off the runqueue and the task
is never again executed.  It's just a couple of stack
pages which are waiting for someone in wait4() to release.
But imagine what happens if the TASK_ZOMBIE task hits
schedule() and finds a tq_scheduler task to run.  And that
task calls schedule().  In state TASK_ZOMBIE.  Messy.
At the very least, the schedule() call will never return.
If the tq_scheduler task sets current->state to 
TASK_[UN]INTERRUPTIBLE (as it should) before calling
schedule() then it has overwritten TASK_ZOMBIE and the
task which is trying to exit has become magically
resurrected.  As far as I can tell, the "dead" task
will run again, do the `fake_volatile' thing in do_exit()
and try to go zombie again.
It would be very interesting to change the test in
schedule():
        sti();
-       if (tq_scheduler)
+       if (tq_scheduler && current->state != TASK_ZOMBIE)
                goto handle_tq_scheduler;
It's all rather unpleasant, and tq_scheduler was killed
in 2.4.  I suggest you take a look at all the serial
drivers in 2.4, see how I converted them to use schedule_task().
Someone kindly ported schedule_task() to 2.2.recent, so you
should be able to use that in the same way.
