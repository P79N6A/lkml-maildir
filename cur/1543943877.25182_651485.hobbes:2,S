Subject: [PATCH] [2/8] CPA: Flush the caches when setting pages not present
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/11/52

e.g. the AMD64 pci-gart code sets pages not present to prevent potential 
cache coherency problems.  When doing this it is probably safer to flush the 
caches too. So consider clearing of the present bit as a cache flush indicator.
Note that debug pagealloc marks pages regularly not present either, but it won't
call this because it calls directly into a lower level function.
I have not actually seen failures from this, but it seems safer 
to do it this way.
