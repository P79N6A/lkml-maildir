Subject: bug: strange smbfs behaviour
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Smbfs acts really strangely when trying to mount share
exported from VMS server (I do not have much access to it, so
I do not have any details about samba version in question)
When I try to mount it to some directory, the directory virtually 
dissapears - it cannot be stat-ed, neither cd-ed into, not even
umounted with smbumount (but I can umount it as root with normal umount)
There are no suspicious messages in syslog.
Other "normal" (winXX, linux samba) servers do behave normally.
There are no problems mounting that one VMS samba server
when using 2.0.36 kernel, everything works as expected.
I use smbmount version 2.0.3, mount 2.9[a-i], kernel 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 
have  the same problem, it does not matter if CONFIG_SMB_WIN95 is 
set or not.
The output from trying to mount it is below.
atlas02:~% ls -ld mnt
