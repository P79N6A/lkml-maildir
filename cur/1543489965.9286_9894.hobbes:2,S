If connection does not die after this, it is harmless.
It is natural race between dst->pmtu and sendmsg (which is amplified,
when socket starts to send big frames when cwnd>1 and with space in sndbuf).
I remember, we decided to NETDEBUG() this. Certainly, we could insert recalc.
of mss everywhere in sender path, but it does not remove the race in any case,
but will introcude new bits in critical path.
What's about copied<acked, it is more serious, I used to believe
that they are observed only in 2.0. No ideas here.
