It should be like this I guess? this patch was not yet tested, please
confirm.

Note the duplicate test 'SCpnt->sc_data_direction == DMA_FROM_DEVICE'
from Documentation/DMA-API.txt:
DMA_TO_DEVICE         = PCI_DMA_TODEVICE      data is going from the
                                              memory to the device
DMA_FROM_DEVICE       = PCI_DMA_FROMDEVICE    data is coming from
                                              the device to the
