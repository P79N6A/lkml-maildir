	Excellent.  And now let's close the other side of compatibility.
The attribute problem we discussed with e2fsck has a simple solution:
exit cleanly when you don't understand a filesystem.
	If e2fsck finds an INCOMPAT flag it doesn't understand, it
didn't *fail* to fsck, it just plain doesn't understand the filesystem.
This should not, in any way, prevent bootup from continuing.  Later,
mount may succeed (if the kernel is new enough) or fail (if not), but my
system won't be completely unusable by surprise (assuming that / isn't
the affected filesystem).
