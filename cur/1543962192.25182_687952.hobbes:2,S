as explained in last mail, I think that we're doing that far less than
we used to because of the ease of "Linus, please pull from git://master...".

As explained, I have no problem hijacking pull requests asking for 1) code
and 2) review if it's not explicitly stated in the message that it has been
reviewed, or that it is an obvious fix. I have no problem trusting the poster,
he should just care not to lie too often or will get a bad reputation of being
a blatant liar.
The only limit is that if I'm alone doing those raids, I'll quickly get into
all developer's blacklist and nothing will change. *YOU* too have to enforce
this policy.
