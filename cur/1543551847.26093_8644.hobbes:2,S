Not the same problem ... but ....
I'm using 2.2.17 with Eicon PCI card (Diva).
I have configured the card with isdnctrl commands. On ísdnctrl dial ippp0'
after some seconds, the machine locks up with a kernel oops (no log)
ín swapper task - no synicing'. Is there any workaround to get this card
working ?
Thanx: Gabor.
