A few random comments...
Adding an internal flag is fine, but please put it at the upper end of
the spectrum. So, use (1 << 31) for that flag.
And please work on the #splice branch of the block repo, not -mm. There
are quite a few things pending for inclusion in there, and I'm sure your
patch as-is wont apply.
