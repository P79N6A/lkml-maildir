Greetings;
Kernel 2.6.20-rds (Cons patch), biostar mobo. 1GB of memory.
I have an elderly 5.25" floppy drive mounted in this box, something I use 
for sneakernet duties to get to a 'legacy' machine occasionally.  It 
hasn't been used for anything in about a month or more.  No disk in it 
now.
Uptime 0d:15:47

About 8 or 9 times since it was rebooted 16 hours ago, and very 
intermittent, it might skip 3 hours, then show two of these stanza's in 3 
seconds.
The drive type is properly set in the bios if that actually means 
anything.
The only mention of floppy in /var/log/dmesg is the ide-floppy driver 
signing in during the boot cause I've got one of those 100MB floppies I 
occasionally use too.  It is not installed at the moment.
Has anyone else seen this in a box with two floppy drives in it?
Cheers, Gene
