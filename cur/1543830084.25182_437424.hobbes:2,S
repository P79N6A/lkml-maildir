Subject: [Suspend2][ 11/35] [Suspend2] Set the filewriter signature to say we have an image.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Given a pointer to a buffer containng the filewriter signature, modify it
so that it will be recognised as an image that we haven't attempted to
resume from before.
