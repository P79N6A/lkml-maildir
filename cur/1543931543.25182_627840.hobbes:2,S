NUMA  bug might not be the only problem. I think there are more issues
as Linus noticed.

Oh, and I see what's wrong: you not only switched "free_page()" to 
"quicklist_free()", you *also* switched "tlb_remove_page()" to 
"quicklist_free()".

The above comment is in reference to below portion of code:
-#define __pte_free_tlb(tlb,pte) tlb_remove_page((tlb),(pte))
+#define __pte_free_tlb(tlb,pte) quicklist_free_page(QUICK_PT, NULL,(pte))
tlb_remove_page() was marking tlb->need_flush. Which is later used
by tlb_flush_mmu(). With quicklist_free_page() we loose all that..
Now in a corner case scenario  with a big munmap() which calls unmap_region()
and if it so happens that the region getting unmapped just has page
tables setup but with all PTE's set to NULL, unmap_region() may
potentially free the page table pages
	[ tlb_finish_mmu() calls check_pgt_cache() which trims quicklist ]
with out flushing the TLB's.
	[ (tlb_finish_mmu() calls the tlb_flush_mmu() but it will not do
           much as need_flush is not set ]
Similarly Linus brought pre-emptions issues associated with quicklist usage..
