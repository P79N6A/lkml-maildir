applied the pio-patch of Osamu Tomita:

 }
now the system keeps working after fsck and thus surviving the first write
to the disk...
after ~half an hour of heavy use (finding+grepping through the kernel
sources, hdparm -tT, dd from /dev/zero to file, all while running
SETI@home) it silently stopped. no messages, no response, SysRq-space gave
no message and it took about five times pressing SysRq-b for the system to
reboot. This time no kernel panic and no errors on filesystem.
