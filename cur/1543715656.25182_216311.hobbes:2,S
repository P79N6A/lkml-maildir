I have attached a tarball with output from dmesg, lspci -vvvxxx, cat  
/proc/interrupts and your dump_pirq.pl utility.
Please note that before booting the 2.6.6-rc2-mm2 kernel I got into the  
BIOS and disabled "Assign IRQ for USB" which is why lspci and dmesg show  
irq 0 assigned to the USB chips.
Besides that change in the BIOS, everything is just the same between the  
reboots, apart from the card not properly working in 2.6.6-rc2-mm2 :/
Anyway, it doesn't look like an irq problem to me. It looks more like a  
wrong detection of the TX triggering level in the driver.
Thanks again, Mirko.
