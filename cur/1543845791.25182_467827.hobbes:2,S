device-mapper patches are discussed on the dm-devel mailing list.
We have discussed the usage of the various mailing lists at the
device-mapper/lvm2 summit here in Germany this week and one decision 
was always to Cc:dm-devel on such patches at submission stage in
future.  (Usually they been on that list already, prior to submission.)
