Doh.  I overlooked one place.
IMO this check needs to be added only to two places.

Did you test this patch?

I suspect that this is caused by unfinished handling of simplex devices
in setup-pci.c (simplex host - one DMA engine but two channels).

I've seen this and decided that it is not needed.
If we try to program drives to DMA on non-DMA host
something is going wrong and it is better to just OOPS.

Yep, I've missed this one.
