I'm resending this to linux-kernel as netdev hasn't sent out any messages
in the past week (at least to me).

Subject: timestamps, paws and out of order packets/acks
Hello all,
I'm wondering if anyone has tackled the problem I pointed out a while ago
where an ack manages to arrive before data sent on the same connection
due, causing the tcp paws support in 2.2/2.3 to dump the data packet?  The
traces at 
http://www.kvack.org/~blah/a.
(leeloo|mole) are still valid
against 2.3.10, and the behaviour disappears when timestamps are disabled.
Debugging verified that tcp_paws_discard is the source of the packet
drops, specifically the second term (...tsval - tp->ts_recent) < 0.
