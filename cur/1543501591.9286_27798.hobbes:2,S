I can't read your patch as it is base64 encoded.
However an interrupt handler does only need to use spin_lock() and not
spin_lock_irqsave() since it is guaranteed that the same interrupt
source will not regenerate an interrupt. So even if the CPU itself is
interrupted it will not reenter the same hander.
