Looks just a bit iffy ... though, thanks for helping to finally
sort this out!

That "continue" case doesn't seem like it should be possible... but
at any rate, the "get" can be deferred until the relevent class
device is known, since that _valid_ handle can't disappear so long
as that semaphore is held.  And if you find the right device but
can't get a reference ... no point in continuing!
Something like a class_find_device() would be the best way to solve
this sort of problem, IMO.  But we don't have one of those.  :(
