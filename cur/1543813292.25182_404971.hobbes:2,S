Hi Ralf. In my kbuild tree I have this fixed already:
my $nm = ($ENV{'NM'} || "nm") . " -p";
my $objdump = ($ENV{'OBJDUMP'} || "objdump") . " -s -j .comment";
Patch is from Aaron Brooks.
The reference_init.pl + reference_discarded.pl are subject for removal
since the check has been moved to modpost.
