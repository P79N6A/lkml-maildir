   I'm afraid I can still reproduce file corruption running NFS from a
   2.2.0pre4 client to a SunOS 5.5.1 server.
At the risk of stating the obvious, you did see the emails here today
from a Sun engineer about a Solaris-2.5 patch which fixes this which
was written some time ago but mistakedly was never made available to
the public via Sun's patch archive?
Later,
