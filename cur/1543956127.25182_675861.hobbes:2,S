An opportunity for Sparse to issue a warning :-)

Any side effect appearing in a sizeof operand ought to be flagged.
There are people out there who think that the side effects occur (even
in C90).
Sentence 1122: 
http://c0x.coding-guidelines.com/6.5.3.4.html
"If the type of the operand is a variable length array type, the operand 
is evaluated;"
But watch out for sentence 1584: 
http://c0x.coding-guidelines.com/6.7.5.2.html
"Where a size expression is part of the operand of a sizeof operator and
changing the value of the size expression would not affect the result of
the operator, it is unspecified whether or not the size expression is
evaluated."

Any sane compiler that performs the analysis needed to deduce that
the expression inside the parenthesis always evaluated to zero
will turn it into....

This language feature came about because at least one vendor on the
WG14 committee had a compiler that optimized away subexpressions
within a sizeof that did not contribute to the result of the
evaluation.  My attempt to stop the behavior being unspecified
did not succeed :-(
