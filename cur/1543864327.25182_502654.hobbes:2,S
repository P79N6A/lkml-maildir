  Morning!
  The 2.6.19 was self-compiled, using the gentoo-sources-rc4 AND using
  the vanilla 2.6.19 from kernel.org (I was recommended to use vanilla
  sources with my ATI drivers), both worked.
  2.6.20 is self compiled to. I will give you the kernel output when I
  am at home, I will have to connect a serial cable to my laptop and use
  the scrollbuffer since on a kernel panic or system crash my keyboard
  leds start to blink, which the kernel sees as a device addressing
  hardware directly and giving me a kernel message for every blink :D
  Oh, and pata_via is the ONLY driver I have compiled built-in,
  regarding libsata. As I mentioned in previous mails I have quite some
  controllers and disks, but pata_via (my onboard IDE) has only two
 drives attaches, on IDE0 (in 2.6.19 ata0) my boot disk
  I also tried to boot with scsi_mod.scan=sync, this didnt work either
  More info follows, thanks for your time allready :)
