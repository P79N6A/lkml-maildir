Yes, this is not that uncommon of a thing. People tend to do this in a
couple of different ways, in some cases the system is too loaded to ever
make doing such a thing at run-time worthwhile, and in those cases these
sorts of things tend to be munged in with the suspend code. Unfortunately
it tends to be quite difficult in practice to keep pages in one place,
so people rely on lame chip-select hacks and limiting the amount of
memory that the kernel treats as RAM instead so it never ends up being an
issue. Having some sort of a balance would certainly be nice, though.
