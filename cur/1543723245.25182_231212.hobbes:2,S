i understand what you mean, but for this to trigger one would have to
trigger the prefetch erratum _and_ then turn off executability in
parallel, right? So the question is, is there a reliable way to trigger
the pagefault situation, and if yes, how do you turn on NX - because
right before the fault the instruction had to be executable.
