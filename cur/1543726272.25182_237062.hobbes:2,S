On an old crappy ia32 machine:
    cw@taniwha:~/wk/linux/cw-current$ time find . -noleaf | wc
      42372   42372 1549653
    real    0m0.188s
    user    0m0.042s
    sys     0m0.146s
that 0.2s to make almost 50K stat64 calls (if you strace and grep you
can see that count).
Since I have to do something with that data (ie. build a kernel) and
that's *probably* going to take many seconds, even making the stat
overhead 0 wouldn't put much of dent into the overall time.
What am I missing?
