   Can anyone tell me if a method exists for saving device driver state
   during shutdown.  It seems to me that there may be instances where
   devices might need to save some state information (in my case, audio
   mixer settings) during shutdown.  Searching through the kernel
   sources and various on-line references I didn't see anything like
   this.  Does anyone think this is a good idea?  If not, does another
   method exists for saving state, for example an ioctl interface to a
   ring 3 component?
Look at how the setserial package grabs configuration state information
from the kernel at shutdown time, and writes it to a file in /etc.   It
then reloads the information at boot time.  It's pretty simple to do
this in an rc script.
