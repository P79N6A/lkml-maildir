Some areas like computer technology in satelites are technology wise back
by over a decade.  Similar embedded controllers where you want the smallest
(read cheapest) system that can do the job.

A friend of mine is still occasionally making money with PDP 8 software.
Some of these systems are being used for control of industrial machines
which keeping up with the version number bloat of the industry was not
necessary and, the hardware seems to be rock solid so they're still
running the same software after all these decades.
How old are these machines today?
