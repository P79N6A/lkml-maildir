I don't really care which is faster, so please don't cc me in any replieds to 
this thread, I 'm just telling my experience.
I've tried OpenGFS on an external firewire hard drive, and I got 13 MB/s(it 
was read, but it shows that the bus can at least handle that much) on a 
WD310100 (which is a pretty old 10GB udma33 hard drive). That would probably 
be even better with ext2 or some fs other than OpenGFS.
