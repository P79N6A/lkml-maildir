Just a small note to say that 2.6.24rc2 (~g8c086340) and rc3
(~g2ffbb837) are the first kernels I have tried since 2.6.22 whose
APIC works on several of my motherboards. The working APIC makes a
very significant, positive difference to the functioning of the gig-e
hardware (MCP55).
To all of those who are responsible for this change, Thank You.
