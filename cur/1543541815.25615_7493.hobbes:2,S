Yeeeek. Gentlemen, I consider that as a proof that the whole idea is
bogus. Dual-universe systems were the horrible source of ugliness. If
that's the cost of including something into Linux - too bad. If _that_
(dual-universe) will go into the ftp.kernel.org tree (I suspect that
nothing short of serious doze of really nasty drugs forcibly administered
to Linus will do that) - well, the tree free from that bogosity will be
available for download within an hour from that sad event. I'll take care
about that.
