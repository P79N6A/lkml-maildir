Hi
I apologize, if this is the wrong, overrun(?), bug reporting address. but I
like to indicate 3 bugs, 2 concering 'make xconfig' and 1 kernel intern:
1) I think scripts/kconfig.tk is builded wrongly. In the frame-buffer subsection
   (menu item Console-drivers) I got an error for the not configured variable
   CONFIG_FB_ATY. The sub menu item (ATI Mach64 display support) of this
   variable is active, but neither yes nor no is selected! This must be the bug.
   [Also if you don't select the experimental/development support, then go
   through all sub-items of the main menu, then change the support of
   experimental/development to yes and choose only, say in the console drivers,
   one experimental option, you will get lots of 'NOT CONFIGURED' messages if
   you finally 'save & exit'.
2) The 'misc binary support' is absolutly necessary to be build into the
   kernel, if you make Big-kernels (make bzImage) as most people do.
   I disabled this support, together with many other changes in the .conf file,
   build my kernel and when try to use it, after the uncompressing message of
   the new kernel I get immediatly
   not enough space --- system halted
   Thus must be explained in the HELP for this item, to prevent hour-long
   searches for building bugs. :(
3) I run my BIOS-clock in local time, e.g. GMT+2
   When the kernel boots he attachs/make two files in my system:
   /etc/mtab and /etc/conf.modules
   After the system is ready for the user (run level 2 or 3 is reached), these
   new files were dated in the future by 2 hours!
   Thus, the internal system-time must be first correctly initialized
   (UT-offset/timezone) before attaching any files in the filesystem.
Regards,
achim
