hopefully we won't have a steady stream of critical bugs. if we do we need
to stop new development and find out where we are going wrong.
after all this isn't microsoft.
one advantage of useing a good version control system is that it should be
very easy to make a minor update to 2.4.20 to produce 2.4.21 without it
being a major disruption to things and then continue with the existing
development. from what I understand about bk it should make it even
easier.
I don't like going to 4 part version numbers. if this was a marketing
driven company that had promised features in 2.4.21 and they aren't ready
but a new version is needed then we would have a reason to do a 2.4.20.1
so that we don't have to deal with broken promises, but sine we aren't in
that situation I don't see why the 2.4.20.N is needed.
Every other time there has been a critical bug it was fixed in the next
normal release number (or if it's critical enough it was handled  by
rushing a version with just that fix like happened with 2.2)
