Hmmm. I'm pretty sure that the partitions are enumerated the same way in 2.4.23
vs. 2.4.18.  There was a change in the way IDE geometry was returned from the
kernel that caused a hiccup in the pdcraid driver around 2.4.22 I think?  My
patch just tells the pdcraid to use an alternate method of finding the RAID
superblock on each drive. Not sure what else might be the problem. Do you see
the ataraid driver fire up (looking something like this):
ataraid/d0: ataraid/d0p1
Drive 0 is 239372 Mb (33 / 0)
Drive 1 is 239372 Mb (34 / 0)
Raid1 array consists of 2 drives.
Promise Fasttrak(tm) Softwareraid driver for linux version 0.03beta
The only problem I've recently come upon with pdcraid, is when it detects just
one of the drives and fails. I didn't think that should happen with raid1 though.
