I think so.
I assume the numbering will stay the same, i.e. 
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 8
EXTRAVERSION =-rc2
will eventually become
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 8
EXTRAVERSION =
and then possibly
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 8
EXTRAVERSION =.1 (or -pl1 etc.)
so it won't require changing scripts.

I think so. The scheme is somehow similar to -AC (Alan Cox') tree -
and we all know that it (the process etc) was working very well.
