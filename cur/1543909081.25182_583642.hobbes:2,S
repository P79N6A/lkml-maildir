There are fewer non-generic bio allocators than you think.

We don't.  Struct bio does not need to be shrunk.  Jens wanted to talk 
about what fields could be eliminated if we wanted to shrink it.  It is 
about time to let that lie, don't you think?

Also true, backed up by numbers on real systems.

Not needed, indeed.  Accurate throttling is needed.  If the best way to 
throttle requires expanding struct bio a little then we should not let 
concerns about the cost  of an int or two stand in the way.  Like Jens, 
I am more concerned about the complexity cost, and that is minimized in 
my opinion by throttling in the generic code rather than with custom 
code in each specialized block driver.
Your patch does throttle in the generic code, great.  Next thing is to 
be sure that it completely closes the window for reserve leakage, which 
is not yet clear.

Daniel
