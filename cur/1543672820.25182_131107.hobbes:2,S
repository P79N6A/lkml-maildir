Subject: ACPI conflict with USB

I'm wondering if there is any work towards correcting the ACPI conflict 
with USB. On my system, I cannot use any USB devices due to a timeout 
anytime I use ACPI with my kernel. Other people have noticed this 
happening on their systems as well, so I am assuming it isn't just on my 
system.
If I could be of assistance with testing patches in an attempt to fix 
this problem, just send me an email outlining what I need to look for 
and do.
Thank you!
