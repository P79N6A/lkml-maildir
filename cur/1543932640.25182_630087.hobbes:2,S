It's quite possible that the BIOS accesses the device either from ACPI 
AML or possibly even from SMI. In that case it would be quite reasonable 
for the BIOS to reserve that region to prevent another driver from 
loading and trying to take conflicting control of the device. One has to 
be careful before assuming that any such reservation is bogus.
