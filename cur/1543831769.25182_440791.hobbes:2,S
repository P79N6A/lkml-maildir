This might be a stupid question, but can someone explain to me why all
of this whole thing is keyed off of the dumpable flag? With the current
scheme setting suid_dumpable to true works around this problem, but that
doesn't seem like it's an intended behavior.
Also, I recently had someone report a problem where a program that
dropped its privileges was not able access /proc/self/maps. So making so
that we can access /proc/self/fd might not be sufficient.
Perhaps we should consider making this use a blacklist instead of a
whitelist approach? That is to make pid_revalidate to change the
ownership of anything under /proc/self to the euid irrespective of the
dumpable flag, except for things that we know need to retain the
previous ownership?
