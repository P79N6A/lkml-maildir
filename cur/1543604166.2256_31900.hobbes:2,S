	Well, I must include it in the kernel to make it work, if I don't
it detects a w83627hf instead of the w83782d, and it is unable to set it
up on the bus:
i2c-proc.o version 2.6.1 (20010825)
w83781d.o version 2.6.1 (20010830)
i2c-core.o: driver W83781D sensor driver registered.
i2c-core.o: client [W83627HF chip] registered to adapter [SMBus AMD7X6 adapter at 80e0](pos. 0).
i2c-core.o: client [W83627HF subclient] registered to adapter [SMBus AMD7X6 adapter at 80e0](pos. 1).
i2c-core.o: client [W83627HF subclient] registered to adapter [SMBus AMD7X6 adapter at 80e0](pos. 2).
i2c-core.o: client [W83782D chip] registered to adapter [SMBus AMD7X6 adapter at 80e0](pos. 3).
w83781d.o: Subclient 0 registration at address 0x49 failed.
	then I get incorrect readings for the every sensors 1 goes up to
77º, 2 goes down to 12º, and 3 goes really down to 0º
	If I include it in the kernel I get the following:
i2c-proc.o version 2.6.1 (20010825)
w83781d.o version 2.6.1 (20010830)
i2c-core.o: driver W83781D sensor driver registered.
i2c-core.o: client [W83782D chip] registered to adapter [SMBus AMD7X6 adapter at 80e0](pos. 0).
i2c-core.o: client [W83782D subclient] registered to adapter [SMBus AMD7X6 adapter at 80e0](pos. 1).
i2c-core.o: client [W83782D subclient] registered to adapter [SMBus AMD7X6 adapter at 80e0](pos. 2).
	And after changing the type of the sensor to 2 (3904 transistor)
it works perfectly, no temp offset, at least it reports the same than the
BIOS (well I cannot be sure of that, but it doesn't differ more than one
or two degrees).
	Yeaahh!! that's outstanding online support, anybody still think
that paid support is better than friendly penguins? :-D
	I'll start burn-testing this box now that I have some way to
check temperature.
	Regards and great thanks!
