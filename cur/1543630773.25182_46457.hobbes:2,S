   Hmm, not sure. I think it's impossible at least on alpha.
   In either case I don't see how "struct pci_domain" etc.
   could help in this case. Probably you'll need some mapping
   function with pdev1, pdev2 as arguments...
I'm not saying pci_domain structure will help, I am only
saying that domain number is not the way to figure out
the ability to do DMA between two devices :-)
I know for a fact that you can do PCI-to-PCI DMA between
two PCI domains on Alpha.
