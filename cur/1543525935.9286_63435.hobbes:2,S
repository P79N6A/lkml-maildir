Maybe because capabilities weren't around (I can't remember) when the
MTRR code was written? And no-one has considered it important enough
to subsequently change?
Frankly, before you start messing with replacing suser(), I'd rather
that we hammer out the exact meaning of capability bits, and what the
"range" of each bit is. The very fact that there are two separate
suggestions for which bit to use for MTRR bothers me: the decision
should be obvious from the documentation on capabilities. It leaves me
less than lukewarm about capabilities.
So I'd rather that MTRR was left alone until the house of capabilities
is cleaned up.
