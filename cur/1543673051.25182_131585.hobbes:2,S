first, as you see in my other reply to Xavier Bestel disabling
"apm idle call" fixed the problem, it seems, but I didn't want
to disable those calls because of thermal reasons.
no matter what frequency it runs at I still wonder what that sound
is anyway. maybe some DELL engineers reading this could provide us
with some insight. fixing symptoms is one thing, knowing the reason
and background info much more important to me.
