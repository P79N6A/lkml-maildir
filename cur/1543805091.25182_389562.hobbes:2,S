I concur:
Locking pages into core is a property/duty of the VM subsystem.
If you have an orthogonal VM subsystem, you cannot later tell how a page was 
mapped into the user's address space. Even more: you may map a file to a 
alocation in the data segment of the proces (that has been retrieved via 
malloc()/brk()) and replace the related mapping with a mapped file.
On Solaris, there is no difference.

As all other rlimits are honored even if you are root, it looks not orthogonal 
to disregard an existing RLIMIT_MEMLOCK rlimit if you are root.
