Because i like to test new kernels. On 2.4 I run the vanila kernel and a 
test kernel. When something went wrong on a test kernel was always a 
stable kernel to use.
2.6 looks a lot like 2.5. New features are added very quickly without much 
testing. Of course there is Andrew's -mm tree but this one sometimes 
is too broken.
For me linux looks now like it has one unstable tree (2.6) which is 
something like -ac was in days of 2.4 and  -mm was in the days of 2.4 
-2.5 and -mm which looks like it became very unstable.
This is what i saw ok lkml (maybe my view is distorted).
I'll stop ranting and try both of them because i have some bugs to report.

That's what's happening on 2.6. Every 2.6.x release is different.
The 2.6.x.y kernels sometimes are almost no different from 2.6.x
