Can we merge also proc/sysfs/network/netfilters virtualization?

virtual private sandbox :)
Actually, we call them "virtual environments" (VE) in OpenVZ. It is more 
than abstract and have a nice brief name. If this suits you - I will be 
happy to commit patches as is :)
other variants:
virtual context (vc, vctx),
virtual containers (vc).
I personally don't like "container", since it is too long and I see no 
good abreviations for this...
