Ok.  That is a reasonable problem and worth solving.
I suspect the easiest way to go is to have something in the code
that points all of the locking activities at the first page in the
block.  Like large pages do but they don't have to be physically
contiguous.
I think that would be even less code then what you are proposing.

Ok.  Now why are high end hardware manufacturers building crippled
hardware?  Or is there only an 8bit field in SCSI for describing
scatter gather entries?  Although I would think this would be
move of a controller ranter than a drive issue.

For I/O we have the BIO which can point to multiple pages just fine.
Buffer heads are irrelevant.  The question is how do we get to
the page cache from the BIO and from the BIO to the page cache.

The change the fundamental fragmentation avoidance algorithm of the
OS.  Use only one size of page.  That is a huge problem.
Yes we do relax that rule but only on things that we don't care
about much and don't mind failing.

This changes the fundamental algorithm for avoiding fragmentation
problems in the VM.  Don't have multiple page sizes.
That rule is relaxed allowing us to use larger pages in special
cases but this is not a special case.  This is the common case.
That is a huge concern.

Huh?  Only if you are doing raw device accesses.  We are limited
to 16TB files.

You have HW_PAGE_SIZE != PAGE_SIZE.    That is you hide the fact from
the bulk of the kernel struct page manges 2 or more real hardware pages.
But you expose it to the handful of places that actually care.
Partly this is a path you are starting down in your patches, with
larger page cache support.
