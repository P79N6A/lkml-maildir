I have the same problem, also on Debian sid on amd64.  I can report that the
Debian version 4.2-20070627-1 of gcc works, 4.2-20070707-1 does not.
Also the hang occurs in udevsettle; if you wait long enough (60 seconds?)
then udevsettle times out and the boot continues (but doesn't get very far
with an almost empty /dev).
For a few more data points, I tried building my kernel with the new compiler
and s/=m/=y/ on the .config and then disabling modules.  This didn't help.
I have also tried mixing modules and vmlinuz from different gcc versions;
whether the hang occurs or not depends only on the version used to compile
the vmlinuz.
