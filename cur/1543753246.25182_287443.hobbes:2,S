Consider this situation:
# #make new vfsmounts at /foo and /bar:
# mount --bind /foo /foo
# mount --bind /bar /bar
# # mount /bar under /foo, *then* put /bar and /mnt2 in the same p-node:
# mount --bind /bar /foo/mnt1
# mount --make-shared /foo
# mount --bind /foo /mnt2
# find # and I think this is what you'll get:
.
./foo
./bar
./bar/file_in_bar
./foo/mnt1
./foo/mnt1/file_in_bar
./mnt2/
./mnt2/mnt1/
Since /mnt2 and /foo are in the same p-node, any mounts we may make
under them later will be shared.  But the mount under under /foo/mnt1 is
*not* automatically propagated to /mnt2/mnt1, and /mnt1 is still in its
own little p-node (so mounts under it won't be replicated).
At least, I think I have that right.
In any case, setting up propagation between two vfsmounts needn't force
propagation of preexisting mounts, it need only affect mounts made later.
