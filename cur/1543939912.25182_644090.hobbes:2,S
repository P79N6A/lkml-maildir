Here's why the driver fails to load:
[   31.133060] ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1b.0[A] -> GSI 22 (level, 
low) -> IRQ 22
[   31.133141] PCI: Unable to reserve mem region #1:4000@febf8000 for 
device 0000:00:1b.0
[   31.133197] ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:1b.0 disabled
[   31.133244] HDA Intel: probe of 0000:00:1b.0 failed with error -16
The iomem location of the HDA controller conflicts with this reservation 
by the BIOS:
[   22.906654] system 00:08: iomem range 0xfebfa000-0xfebfac00 has been 
reserved
There was a patch floating around to ignore PnPACPI reservations which 
conflict with PCI BARs, which appears to be what's happening in this 
case. That patch originally worked for any board, but was later made 
specific to a certain Supermicro motherboard which had the sata_nv 
controller MMIO regions marked as reserved, preventing the driver from 
loading. We may need a more general solution. See:
