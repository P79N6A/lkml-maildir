Because in the absence of an MMU, an mmap of a large region (like an
executable) has to be satisfied by a large enough allocation followed by
a read.

I think these parts aren't FRV-specific; they're the fixes required to
do proper shared readable mmap with !CONFIG_MMU. That was a prerequisite
for the ELF-FDPIC executable format, which allows real shared libraries
on uClinux.
