If this is addressed to me, you are severely confused.
Hmmm...
Some people seem to think that using a "file system internal to the file"
will be good, since it lets an app avoid writing out a whole new file
when something in the middle needs to expand. This apparent enhancement
is not free though, as I showed in my response to Viro & Reiser. It is
in fact much slower for many common operations. You pay either way.
You get performance only by avoiding the extra layer. This can be done
via normal directories or via compound document support in the existing
filesystem layer. Normal directories leave you with user-interface
problems and complicated code in every app. (note: the NeXT is dead)
Compound document support is not at all a pretty feature, but it does
seem to solve the problems.
Choose your poison.
