Juergen,
	The whole tasklet_kill function is a big confusion. It is a big 
misnomer as Werner rightly said. For non-recursive tasklets this  
function does not do anything. Its just an expensive "nop". If you simply 
call tasklet_schedule after tasklet_kill, it will execute as nothing had
happened. 
If we remove the line 
clear_bit(TASKLET_STATE_SCHED, &t->state);
from tasklet_kill then tasklet_kill will have the desired effect of 
"killing" the tasklet, tasklet_schedule() after tasklet_kill in that case, 
will not call __tasklet_kill and hence it will not be queued to the CPU
queue and hence it will not run (desired effect).
tasklet_kill I believe was written to kill recursive tasklets only 
(tasklets that schedule themseves from inside their handler), but as we 
have seen for that particular case it hangs. 
I feel either we remove tasklet_kill or fix it to do what it should.
Alexey, can u please comment on my observations.
Thanx,
tomar
