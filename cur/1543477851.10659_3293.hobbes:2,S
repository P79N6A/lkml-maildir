   Note that this includes all the _IO_* functions because the layout of
   FILE has changed. This in fact demonstrates the one major problem with
   symbol versioning -- suppose we have a glibc-2.1 program which passes
   a FILE* to a shared library which was compiled with glibc 2.0...
There's an obvious solution to this problem, given that FILE *'s are
allocated by the library and the internal structure is completely opaque
to the calling application --- put a magic/version number at a standard
location in the structure, so you can distinguish old FILE*'s from New
*'s.
Actually --- given that FILE *'s are supposed to be a black-box
abstraction --- why did you have to version the interfaces just because
the layout of FILE * is changed?
