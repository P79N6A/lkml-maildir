NO!!! In this case, you are not using bk, you are accessing information 
that is placed in a public place. If your argument were to hold any 
water, then people constrained from using bk due to any clause of the 
bkl could not access any information on bkbits.net. The mere act of 
pointing their browser there would be a violation. Since these people 
are not able to agree to the bkl, they are not constrained by the 
restrictions of the bkl. The only effect is that they can *never* use bk.
Either browsing bkbits.net is a use of bk and non-licensed people can't 
use it, or it is is not a use of bk and none of the bkl restrictions 
apply. Can't have it both ways.
