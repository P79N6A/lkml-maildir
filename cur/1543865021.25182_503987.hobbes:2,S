All the ATM drivers seem to do it like this.  That doesn't mean they are
right of course!  But I never saw anyone complain on the ATM mailing list.
On the other hand, why does Simon want this?  If he has written a user space
tool that extracts bits from the proc file (eg: to tell users what's going
on) then he could run into trouble, depending on how he implements it.
Ciao,
