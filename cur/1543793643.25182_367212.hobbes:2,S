I can't because I need to allocate 128MB of memory per PCI card and if I put for example 4 cards, I'll have 512MB in kernel memory, and I think there will be some problem in kernel.

I have a plx bridge PCI9656 with a DMA controler. So I have to make a 
descriptor table with physical address and size.
I work in 32 bits address mode, but I don't know which function to call 
to get a 36bits address for my controler.
Regards.
