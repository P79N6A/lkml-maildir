Unfortunately its an embedded box w/o LAPIC. Embedded systems with low
computing power and restricted peripherals are often used in industrial
environments and likely to be a major client of RT/HRT implementations.

This requires to run the 1/Hz timer code with high priority in order to
run as close as possible to the jiffie edge. I know that you made this
move in order to make the HRT code less intrusive, but I think this
trades code beauty with latency issues. In order to reduce the latency
for HRT timers it will be necessary to split the timer list work into
pieces.
Jiffie interrupt
- Move the HRT timers out of the next jiffie bucket, reprogram HRT
timesource.
- Run the shadowed HRT timers, which are close to the jiffie edge (too
close to reprogram the HRT timesource)
- Move expired low res timers to a work list
- schedule the low res timer work
Not sure, if this is less intrusive than the previous modifications to
add_timer/mod_timer/del_timer, which can nicely be done with simple
macros and does not touch the low res timer list including the
processing at all.

Sure, is there any API available to select the timer type / priority ?

Make sense.
