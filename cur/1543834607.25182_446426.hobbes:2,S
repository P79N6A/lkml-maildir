And why bother allowing it, if a mesh like that isn't something you want

Not an "interesting case" - that's the real world.  You allow hard
links to directories, somebody on this list *is* going to hardlink their
directory of driver code into several kernel trees so they can regression
test compiles against multiple trees.
You don't want to deal with the results of allowing that, don't allow that. ;)

You need to lock a *lot* of stuff - otherwise 2 separate links can race and
form a loop, even though they are operating in very different parts of
the directory graph.
You can't even answer the question "Will a proposed link cause a loop?"
without locking the tree, since you have to search the whole tree.  An
apparently unrelated change in a part of the tree you've already searched
can cause a loop because what you started with isn't what you finished
with (see the unrelated thread about locking or copying the process list
so 'ps' doesn't race for the sort of issues involved).

I meant that 'z' may not be "under" a/b/c/d in the conventional sense -
the criterion is the much flabbier "must be reachable from" (which leads
to the "have to enumerate the whole frikking filesystem" issue).  d could
contain a link back "up" to e/f/g, which links back "down" to 'h/i/j/k",
and h/i/j/k/l has a link back "up" to something that eventually leads to z.
And you still haven't explained what '..' means in this context.  I'm
sure programmers will be *thrilled* to have to deal with this:
mkdir a b c
mkdir b/a b/d a/a
ln b/a a/z
ln c/b b/a
# Now watch the fun with a context-sensitive '../a':
cd a/z; cd ../a <- succeeds, but leaves you elsewhere
cd b/a; cd ../a <- succeeds, and leaves you where you started
cd c/a; cd ../a <- fails
(To be fair, most programs that have issues with this are racy against
renames of ../a already - but this one can cause fun and games even on a
filesystem mounted r/o and apparently immutable...)
