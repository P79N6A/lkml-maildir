In 2.4.18, it looks like this when booting initrd and switching
to a hard disk. This looks okay.
/dev/root.old /initrd ext2 rw 0 0
/dev/root / ext2 rw 0 0
/dev/sdc1 /alt ext2 rw 0 0
/dev/sdc3 /home/users ext2 rw 0 0
none /proc proc rw 0 0
/dev/sda1 /dos/drive_C msdos rw 0 0
/dev/sda5 /dos/drive_D msdos rw 0 0
Cheers,
