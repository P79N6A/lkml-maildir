Unless it stamps on things or overflows its stack or..
Memory corruption is probably the most probable one although nothing 
suprises me as a driver bug any more.

Ok so your fibrechannel side is apparently behaving right.

Check all the memory allocations you do. Also check you catch any NULL
returns. Also check use of the io_request lock - although I'd expect you
to find 'request list destroyed' messages if that was wrong.
It could be sd.c not doing checks so look at that too.
Another one to check is that your scatter gather limits are right. Does
the card blow up doing pure writes ?

Connect a serial port of system 1 to system 2, and boot system 1 with
the serial console options. All system messages then go down the serial
port
