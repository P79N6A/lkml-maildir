32bit dev_t is a showstopper
then 
Debugging, debugging, and more debugging
Driver porting
Driver resyncs with 2.4
Finding the remaining scsi bugs
A ton more IDE work before I am happy
Fixing the pci api hotplug races
DRM 4.3 cleaned up and working
I think the dev_t one is the only stopper now before we go into
stop futzing with core code and fix bugs mode
