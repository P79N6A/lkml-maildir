Agreed.  Perhaps something like:
Integrity Based Access Control(IBAC) uses the Linux Integrity
Module(LIM) API calls to verify an executable's metadata and 
data's integrity.  Based on the results, execution permission 
is permitted/denied.  Integrity providers may implement the 
LIM hooks differently.  For more information on integrity
verification refer to the specific integrity provider 
documentation.

The ability of changing LSM modules at runtime might be perceived
as problematic.

Yes, as this implies that another LSM module registered the hooks first,
preventing IBAC from registering itself. 
Thank you for your other comments.  They'll be addressed in the next
ibac patch release.
