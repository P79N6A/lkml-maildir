Very constructive. If you would use this zealotry energy in getting 
results from Philips, we might not be here arguing. I get the feeling some 
seem to think of the removal of this popular driver as a *contribution* to 
Linux. This attitude contributes nothing to Linux. If you don't like a 
partially binary driver, then I suggest you, too, contact Philips instead 
of turning on your own users and contributors, or fighting with driver 
maintainers that simply can't change the world to fit your wishes. We are 
all in this mess, we all want good working drivers, preferably opensource.
If the opensource principle really is that important to you, I invite you 
to send an email to Philips like the rest of us. And not attack people for 
wanting to have their hardware in a working state, or turning this into a 
BSD vs. GPL discussion.

Thanks in advance!
