Subject: unusual_devs entries for Vivicam and others

While searching for hints how to get the Vivicam 355 working in Linux, I
found that Lycoris Desktop/LX supports it.
I looked into their sources and they have a patch for adding
unusual_devs-Entries to the kernel-source.
I also found that they have two patches for sony-cameras not in the
kernel.
I testet the Vivicam-Patch and it works. I didn't test the
Sony-patches, so I don't know about them. (I assume they work, ask
lycoris for details)
Please apply the Vivicam-Patch to the kernel. I've put the patches
online, because to get them from lycoris, you have to download their
source-iso-cd.
