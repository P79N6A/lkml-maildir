Also depends on the content of the patch. If it is tricky to read/non
obvious etc it will usually draw some comments before being merged.
Some patches get missed/overlooked completely - in that case it's up
to you to make sure it gets resend after a while (if it draws no
comments and doesn't get merged, then resending it after the next
majoe, -rc or -mm release, updated to apply to that release, is
usually good).
I've personally sent patches that got merged by someone within a few
minutes, but I've also seen patches suddenly get merged that I had
completely forgotten about that some maintainer just picked up from
the list weeks after I had sent it.

Resend the patch and check your To: and Cc: lists. Read the
MAINTAINERS file to find out who to send it to, as well as comments in
the top of the source file. Adding linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org to Cc:
in any case, in addition to other recipients, is usually a good thing
as well.
