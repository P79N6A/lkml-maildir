Ok.

Yes. However two things apply here that are important
1.	It may do PPP, but if I flip it to X.25 it may not do X.25, so the
	board itself needs a control of how it hands packets around.
2.	I may want to be able to add a board specific ioctl to pick hardware
	(low cpu overhead) v software (multilink, cool feature set) PPP
