	I got my degree in Physics, so I learned to program in Fortran.   In 
that day, however, there were folks who were clamoring for more C 
programming in science.   I took one look at it and gagged on the pointers 
and mallocs.  In my opinion, no scientist should trust C code for important 
numerical work unless he has too; that's why Fortran was created in the first 
place. 
	Anyhow, one of the local self-appointed Unix gurus was aghast at
my distaste for C's primitiveness.   Alas, I feal justified today because 
Perl, Java, C#, and Cyclone are proving that C is for systems programming and 
not for everyday use.
	That much said, I still am only fluent in Fortran, shell, Perl (and a little
Tcl/TK), so I don't really consider myself a programmer, just a sysadmin with
a clue.
