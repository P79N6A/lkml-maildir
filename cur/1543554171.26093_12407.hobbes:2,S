Dear Sirs,
   May I have your help on re-build kernel?
   I wanna find /usr/src/linux/include/linux/tasks.h and change the NR_TASKS to increase the limitation of max processes. But It's not there under kernel 2.4.0-test10. where can I find it?
   All I wanna get, is to increate the max processes and max_open files under 2.4.0-test10.
   I've changed my OPEN_MAX to 1024 in limits.h . is it 1024 the max under 2.4.0?
   I don't know is this mail right to the linux-kernel maillist. If it's wrong, Say sorry to you and please ignore this mail.
   Thanks and sorry to bother you!
