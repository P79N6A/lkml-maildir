Roger,
Just tried the via-rhine driver in 2.4.21-pre7 and it appears to exhibit
the problem Erik Hensema reported with the VT6103 onboard network card
on my Chaintech 7VJL Athlon board whereby you get NETDEV Watchdog
transmit timeout errors unless you turn local io-apic off in which case
it all works fine.
Please cc me directly as I'm not subscribed to the mailing list.
Thank you,
	Mark Syms
