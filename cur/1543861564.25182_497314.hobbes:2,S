I bought this mp3 player that takes SD cards here
http://www.aiptek.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=AX4&Category_Code=MP3&Store_Code=AS
I can provide the errors in dmesg, if necessary, but this flag was
determined as necessary by doing a quick google on the errors
that were shown in dmesg.
I've been sitting on this patch for a while.  Formally submitting
patches seems daunting. I hope I did this right.
This patch is against vanilla 2.6.19, although it should work fine for
any newer kernel.  Thanks!
