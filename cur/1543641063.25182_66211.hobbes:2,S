I set max_interrupt_work to higher values, 
e.g. 500 (instead of the default value 20) and the message in /var/log/messages
does not appear - no wonder. But I still get large numbes of RX errors and
RX overruns (these numbers are equal most of the time). So receiving
is to slow and brings RX overruns.
Is there anything I can do about it? 
It's a Athlon 1200 and that should be
fast enough to receive data on a single connection.
    still confused, but now on a higher level
