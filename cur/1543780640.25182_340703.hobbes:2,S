Hi,
any explanation about the 10 chars limit for kernel workqueue name ?
another question: why is the name length test managed by BUG_ON ?
returning a NULL workqueue is done in the next test (failed kmalloc for wq)...
Anyway, this can explain some issues when loading some SCSI drivers modules.
hope that somebody knows...
