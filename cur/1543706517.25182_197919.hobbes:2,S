This is wrong.  The direction parameter says what was done by the device/cpu
for the DMA, this is needed by the port to know how to perform the
pci_dma_sync_single et al. correctly.
For example, a port may have to do something different for FROM_DEVICE vs.
TO_DEVICE to properly execute the pci_dma_sync_single() request.
MIPS (and seemingly ARM) are probably the best platforms by which to draw up
the worst case scenerio for the implementation of these things :) and thus
the optimizations made possible by certain combinations of request+direction.
