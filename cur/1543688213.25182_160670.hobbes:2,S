PG_locked and mapping->page_lock held for writing are needed to
switch in general AIUI; adding the vcache/futex locks into the mix
sounds like some deep hierarchy, especially since the page is
meant to go away in the middle of this process. move_to_swap_cache()
has mapping->page_lock held for writing, as is needed; PG_locked is
required to add_to_swap() and some other callers are from call chains
not checking BUG_ON(!PageLocked(page)) so it sounds as if things are
partly there, assuming vcache_lock/futex_lock stay at the bottom.
I think it's worth coming up with an answer to in order to remove
the DoS scenario and/or resource scalability limitations.
