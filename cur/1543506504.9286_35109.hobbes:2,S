hello again.
i have just installed 2.3.13 and the program now runs.
it would seem that nothing has really changed though - the kernel
reports similar errors but just chooses to ignore them.
i would like it fix this if i can. the errors i get are as follows:
Aug 21 02:42:18 appc-keith kernel: fd_offset is not page aligned. \
	Please convert program: xxx
i realise that this is probably not the correct forum for my question
but i would be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction.
thanks.
keith.
