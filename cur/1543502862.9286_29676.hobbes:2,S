I just tried that, and the problem remained. Putting the sym53c8xx driver
into the kernel but keeping SCSI disk/CD/generic support as modules led to
weird things: disk not recognized, two versions of 'scsi' (identical
file entries) in /proc/scsi.
This might be my mistake, however, because I hadn't removed the old
modules before installing the new ones.
In the end I put the whole SCSI subsystem IN the kernel. This time I
did remove the old modules. I only thought of the old modules after having
build an all static SCSI sub system, otherwise I wouldn't have changed
both factors at once, sorry. Now the same happened: oops after
interrupting a cdrecord dummy recording session.
You want me to write down another oops? Only I probably won't have time
for that before Sunday...
Regards,
