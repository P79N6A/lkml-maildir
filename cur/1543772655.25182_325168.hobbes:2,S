I am not affected. I compile my kernels with zero alignment.
Not my itch to scratch.

Do you realize how large linux kernel is? Are you going to optimize all of it

People tend to gradually update their systems. Make gcc better, and it will
pay back with time. If you want that benefit _now_, then use your better gcc
immediately instead of stone age one. Others will take care of themselves.
If you feel like sprinkling tons of asm() over zillions of lines of code instead
- good luck :)
