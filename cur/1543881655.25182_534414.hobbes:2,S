It's only used in the instable path which is kind of "i already threw up
my hands" anyways
I use it because when you transition from stable (TSC) to instable (jiffies)
the only way to avoid the clock jumping backwards is to remember and update the 
last value. To avoid races with parallel cpufreq handlers or timer
interrupts this small section needs to run with interrupts disabled.
The alternative would be a seqlock, but people have complained about this
earlier too so i judged irq disabling better.
