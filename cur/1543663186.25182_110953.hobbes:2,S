ok, so i could have picked a better example than ISDN as a 
submenu for "Networking", but my main point still stands --
the "Networking support" menu cannot have submenus incorporated
below it without changing the specific Kconfig file for that
directory.  and that gets incredibly messy as one tries to 
follow a menu structure around the various kernel source
directories.  ("Multimedia" was another example of an
unfortunately inflexible menu, so you see my point.)
perhaps you're right -- perhaps there is no nice solution
and there's not much point pursuing this.  but given that
linux is being more widely adopted every day, it's clear
that more and more people are going to be building kernels,
it still might be worth trying to address this before it
goes much further.
i'll go with tomas' suggestion to wait until the new 
config grammar is out.  until then, i'm just going to
play with theoretically reorganizing the menus and see
what eventually makes sense to me, regardless of whether
it's ever implemented or not.
