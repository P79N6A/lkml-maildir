Every chip requires a different amount of cooling.  Use the right
fan/heatsink and you don't have a problem.  The original Cyrix 6x86 ran
the hottest until they came out with the 6x86L (split voltage, ala the
P5 MMX).  The K6 runs a bit cooler than most Pentium II's.  The big
difference is that the PII has alot more surface area to dissipate the
heat with.
