Considering the only difference between 2.2.8 and 2.3.0 is 3 version
numbers, I don't see how it could raise any more complaints than the
2.2.X series kernels they've been building for weeks.  Then again,
it is the Slashdot crowd.

There really isn't any distinction to be made, other than one has a 2
in it and one has a 3.
