The gcc source does not stress the compiler as much as the linux kernel
source.  At least the C part of gcc is written in a way that even some
broken compilers still generate non-broken code.  This is not so much the
case with the other backends, since they are expected to be compiled with
gcc (after the bootstrap pass has finished).
