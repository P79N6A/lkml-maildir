I have a few ideas for additional checks you could add to that script:
 - Source files should be 7bit ASCII and Documentation/Kbuild
files/etc should be UTF-8, test that the patch honors that and doesn't
put something else in (cleanups that remove 8bit ASCII etc from a
source file is OK though).
- Check that nothing in the patch touches any file from Documentation/dontdiff
- Check for an excessive number of blank lines - some people have a
nasty tendency to put 3 or more blank lines between functions or
between comments and next source line etc.
- Check that all newlines added by the patch are "\n", not "\r",
"\r\n" or "\n\r".
- Check that, if the patch adds a new file, the new file ends with a newline.
- Warn about usage of the "register" keyword.
- Maybe warn about usage of float/double in source files?
- 'return' is not a function, so warn about patches that think it is
and use 'return(expr);' (this one is tricky since 'return (expr);' can
be OK in some cases.
That's all I can come up with at the moment. If more ideas pop up I'll
let you know.
Good work with that script btw.
