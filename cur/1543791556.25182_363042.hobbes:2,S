Subject: [KORG] patch-2.6.14-git6 tarball: EMPTY
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The tarballs for 2.6.14-git6 located at:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/
are empty!
...I'd rather not install git on this machine, so I'll just have to work 
off of -git5 for today.
Cheers,
Michael Krufky
