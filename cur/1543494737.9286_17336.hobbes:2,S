  Hello.
  When looking into quota code I found out that endianity isn't
the only architecture dependent part of files. The struct dqblk -
the on-disk structure uses type time_t. This type is defined as
long on every architecture so in fact the *lenght* of structure
is architecture dependent (not mentioning the eventual padding).
  So I think it won't be possible to make files architecture
independent without having to change file format (and so have to
force users to convert their quota files)...
