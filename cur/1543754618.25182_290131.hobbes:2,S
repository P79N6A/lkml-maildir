Oh, that's a separate issue. We want to have multiple levels of security.
We not only try to make sure that there are easy interfaces (but yeah, I 
don't force people to rewrite - I sadly don't have a cadre of slaves at my 
beck and call ;p), but it's also always a good idea to have interfaces 
that are bug-resistant even in the face of people actively not using the 
better interfaces.
So having good interfaces that are harder to have bugs in does _not_ mean 
that we still shouldn't have defensive programming practices anyway. The 
combination of the two means that a bug in one layer hopefully gets caught 
be the other layer.
