Hi Russell,
Thanks for your answer.

The failure mode is good. The monitoring process dies, the
interface stays up, ospfd keeps advertising the route, named
keeps running. We pick up the lack of a monitoring process
in Nagios, manually down lo:1 so the traffic goes elsewhere
and investigate the fault. No customer impact unless
named dies for some independent reason before the NOC staff
down lo:1.

The failure mode for a parent monitoring process is not good.
The monitoring process dies, the interface stays up, ospfd
keeps advertising the route, the child named dies.  Since
we still have incoming DNS requests but no running DNS server,
customers will need to timeout and try the next DNS server
in their /etc/resolv.conf.  So customer impact is severely
reduced performance web performance until the NOC staff log
in and down lo:1.
As you can see, the basic requirement is for the lo:1 interface
to track the state of the named process at all times.
> What if the dbus system dies?  What if your monitoring process dies?
As long as these don't kill named whilst failing, we have enough
time to sort it out manually. Nagios (or whatever system health
monitor you shoose to configure) will hassle the Network Operations
Center in short order.

That's why I'm posting here. I'd settle for some simple answer,
even if it is particular to Linux.

No need. Dropping lo:1 makes the DNS traffic go to a healthier
server. Then the box can be left as-is so the sysadmins can take
it apart to find the basic cause of the fault.
Thanks for your thoughts. Some monitoring mechanism that didn't
kill named if it goes wrong would be fantastic.
