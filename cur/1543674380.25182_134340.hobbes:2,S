For these runs, i'm using the STP wrap.sh - you can get that kit from stp cvs 
if you need.
The wrap.sh does the disk setup and a few other things,then invokes the test. 
The two runs are done like this -> (4 cpu machine)
./reaim -s4 -x -t -i4 -f workfile.new_dbase -r3 -b -lstp.config -> for the 
maxjobs convergence
./reaim -s4 -q -t -i4 -f workfile.new_dbase -r3 -b -lstp.config -> for the 
'quick' convergence
stp.config has the poolsizes and path for disk directories:
FILESIZE 80k
POOLSIZE 1024k
DISKDIR /mnt/disk1
DISKDIR /mnt/disk2
DISKDIR /mnt/disk3
DISKDIR /mnt/disk4
Options: 
the -b surpresseses stdout and creates an html version of the report. - this 
is for STP and
not necessary. 
the -r3 runs the test three times
-t turns off the adaptive increment
