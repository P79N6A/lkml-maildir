   most recent (dont know how far back) versions of netstat
   display /proc/net/snmp and /proc/net/netstat (with the 
   Linux TCP MIB), so netstat -s should show you most of 
   whats interesting. Or were you referring to something else?
   ifconfig -a and netstat -rn would also be nice to have..
TSO gets turned off during retransmits/SACK and the card does not do
retransmits.
Can we move on in this conversation now? :-)
