That sounds totally fine; in fact, it's how my Poller library works.

But do you remember that this fd is ready until EWOULDBLOCK?
i.e. if you're notified that an fd is ready, and then you
don't for whatever reason continue to do I/O on it until EWOULDBLOCK,
you'll never ever be notified that it's ready again.
If your code assumes that it will be notified again anyway,
as with poll(), it will be sorely disappointed.

Yeah, that would break it, too, I think.
