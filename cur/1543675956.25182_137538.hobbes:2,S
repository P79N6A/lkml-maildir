Spraying garbage all over source code destroys editor agnosticism, even
if some editor exists that can hide all the crap like trailing
whitespace, spaces where tabs belong, and screwed-up indentation. Use
emacs all you want. Don't force others to use some particular editor by
spewing garbage all over the kernel source that requires some special
editor to hide.
