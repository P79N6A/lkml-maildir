Andries,
The crap out is between 2.4.0-test5 and 2.4.0-test6.
It takes four drives that were single partitioned and rips the first 130
blocks out and creates 4 bogus partitions.
Partition check:
 /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0: p1 p2 p3 < p5 p6 p7 p8 p9 p10 >
 /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target1/lun0: p1
 /dev/ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0: p1 p2 p3 p4
 /dev/ide/host2/bus0/target1/lun0: p1 p2 p3 p4
 /dev/ide/host2/bus0/target2/lun0: p1 p2 p3 p4
 /dev/ide/host2/bus0/target3/lun0: p1 p2 p3 p4
Was
Partition check:
 /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0: p1 p2 p3 < p5 p6 p7 p8 p9 p10 >
 /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target1/lun0: p1
 /dev/ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0: p1
 /dev/ide/host2/bus0/target1/lun0: p1
 /dev/ide/host2/bus0/target2/lun0: p1
 /dev/ide/host2/bus0/target3/lun0: p1
This is the difference between boots.
