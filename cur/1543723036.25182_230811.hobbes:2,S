This is wrong - max_low_pfn can be high on systems where physical RAM
doesn't start at address 0.  Such is very common on ARM platforms,
where RAM is located at 0xa0000000 or 0xc0000000 physical, which
leads to any calculation based upon max_low_pfn to believe we have
more than 3GB of RAM when we may only have 64MB or so.
I think we may need a num_lowpages for this...
