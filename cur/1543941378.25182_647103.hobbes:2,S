yes, i'm wondering if the changes in IO resource reservations
in the PNPACPI layer are interfering with the native driver.
unfortunately, if you boot with acpi=off or pnpacpi=off, you may
run into other, unrelated, issues (or not).
one way to isolate the problem is if you revert these two lines
from their 2.6.24 values to their 2.6.23 values by applying this patch:
