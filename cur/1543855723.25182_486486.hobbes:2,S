SHORT CONCLUSION: it was just a kernel miscompilation (I usually do
"make oldconfig; make clean; make" so I don't know if I missed "make
clean" or if it was caused by ccache...).
The fact that it's a miscompilation is "proved" by 3 simple things:
1) I've only seen the problem with that particular version
2) slow bisection pointed that the ipotetic bug was fixed between
4b1c46a3..d1ed6a3e, but I don't see any change that matters (on x86_64).
3) I'm running a clean recompiled 2.6.19-rc4-g4b1c46a3, that doesn't
have any problem.
