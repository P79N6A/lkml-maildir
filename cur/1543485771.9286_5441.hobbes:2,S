Some stuff to check:
* Does music play from both speakers if you plug them into the audio
jack on the CD-ROM drive?
* Can you use eg cdda2wav to rip an audio track, then play the wav? does
it sound right?
* Did the problem occur with 2.0.xx?
* Have you tried downloading the trial version of the commercial OSS?
Did(does) it work? [www.4front-tech.com]
* If you plug a different device into the CD audio input on your
soundcard (fm tuner?) does the same thing happen?
* Does the problem happen if you plug the CD audio cable into an
auxillary input on your sound board? (if it has one, that is)
Basically, it is going to be one (or more?) of three problems: Your Cd
drive is hosed. Your CD audio cable is hosed. Or, the drivers for that
sound board are hosed.
If you verify that it is definitely not hardware, you should talk to the
OSS people next.
