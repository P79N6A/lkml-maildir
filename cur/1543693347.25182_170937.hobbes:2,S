Well, I don't see "standard means for functionality" mentioned anywhere
in the GPL or copyright law (though I'm no expert on that).
If a header contains a macro that expands to real code and a module
has to use that, it means that it absolutely needs that part of kernel
source code to function and then it is a derived work because it
includes GPL'ed code and would not work without it.

Says who? Who defines what is unprotected API and what is not?

Well, silly me, I only buy hardware with open source drivers available.
I wouldn't agree that something is good and has to be done just because
it would improve Linux' "success" (I wouldn't define that to be
commercial success, either).
