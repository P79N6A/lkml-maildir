Try it. I bet it doesn't do so, and certainly not usably. Blasting UDP
frames is seldomly useful without checks, like NFS performs.

Depends. With some network adaptors it might. Definition of 'zero-copy' is
somewhat misty. Some variants of zero-copy would actually be called
'one-copy' or 'minus-one-copy' in other contexts.
