It should be noted what broke was the non-portable constructs in the generic
suspend code.
In particular using __pa() outside of architecture code is not allowed.
Using virt_to_phys() on addresses not part of the kernel's linear mapping is
not generically supported.
text/data are not required to be part of the kernel's linear mapping.
This patchset now causes all code using these non-portable constructs to
fail on x86_64.  Which I think is a good thing so we can more easily
spot these kinds of problems.
Patches 15 and 16 appear to make the swpsuspend code rely on portable
constructs.   I will let Vivek reply to the amount of testing he has
done in this area.
