Inded.  Thanks a lot for the report and detailed analysis!  Much
appreciated.
I have been meaning to do the needed changes anyway so the new OSX and
Linux drivers are more alike but had not gotten round to it yet...  Now
that I know it actually causes a deadlock I will bite the bullet and do
the changes now.
ps. Aplogies for delayed response but I was on holiday without
computers/internet access...
Best regards,
