Not at all. Oddly, you want to cover this up. I could see wanting
to get this off of linux-kernel though. Oh well, too late.
This is that whole non-LGPL library issue again. Richard Stallman
wants us to come to his Kool-Aid party.
Personally, I hope to do my part with the readline library.
I'm not starting now, but judging by the binary size it looks
like 10 to 20 thousand lines of code. I may enjoy the chance
to get back at RMS for the library crap.
Someone want to do libio? That is the one that could send some
distributions back to libc 5.
(note about glibc: I warned about this a _long_ time ago)
