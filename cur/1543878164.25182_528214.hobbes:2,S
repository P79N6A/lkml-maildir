Subject: [PATCH 0/13] maps#2: pagemap, kpagemap, and related cleanups take 2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch series introduces /proc/pid/pagemap and /proc/kpagemap,
which allow detailed run-time examination of process memory usage at a
page granularity.
The first several patches whip the page-walking code introduced for
/proc/pid/smaps and clear_refs into a more generic form, the next
couple make those interfaces optional, and the last two introduce the
new interfaces, also optional.
This respin adds simple, expandable headers to both pagemap and
kpagemap as suggested by Nikita. I haven't moved pagewalk.c from lib/
to mm/ as suggested by Nick as I still think lib is a better fit for
its automatic conditional linking.
