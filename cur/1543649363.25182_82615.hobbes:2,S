Since the sys_epoll ( and /dev/epoll ) fd support standard polling, you
can mix sys_epoll handling with other methods like poll() and the AIO's
POLL function when it'll be ready. For example, for devices that sys_epoll
intentionally does not support, you can use a method like :
	put_sys_epoll_fd_inside_XXX();
	...
	wait_for_XXX_events();
	...
	if (XXX_event_fd() == sys_epoll_fd) {
		sys_epoll_wait();
		for_each_sys_epoll_event {
			handle_fd_event();
		}
	}
