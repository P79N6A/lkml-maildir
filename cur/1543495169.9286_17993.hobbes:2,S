I have seen a case of a system with 2xP2/400 CPU's and maxed out with
RAM perform faster on a UP kernel than an SMP one, so such is possible
with certain loads. However, general performance is near enough
impossible to measure, otherwise the marketing droids would've been
doing so for years now...
Best wishes from Riley.
