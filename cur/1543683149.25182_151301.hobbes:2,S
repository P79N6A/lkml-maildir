I have seen this, too, with two harddisks (hda, hdb) on a recent 2.5
kernel: warnings about DMA timeouts on one of them, immediately followed by
a message about turning off DMA on the other one. I had to replace one of
the disks subsequently and lost the logs, but I remember wondering about
that. I supposed the kernel might have some reason to blame the hard disk
without warnings (both harddisks seemed rather suspicious at the time).
