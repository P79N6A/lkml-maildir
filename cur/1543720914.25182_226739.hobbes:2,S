Subject: [PATCH] fix cpumask.h in mainline for UPu
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I'm trying to replace for_each_cpu() with for_each_cpu_mask() in
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/p4-clockmod.c
Unfortunately, though, davej pointed me that for_each_cpu_mask()
is not defined in -bk if CONFIG_SMP is not defined.  Since this macro is
the only one not defined if compiled for UP, and since -mm tree do have
the correct behaviour already, is it possible to get this patch in mainline
before this portion of -mm is merged?
