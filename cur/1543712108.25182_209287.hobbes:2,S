Theoretically, which I know can be a pain, user space timer granularity 
should be in USER_HZ as, theoretically, this is the only one user space 
is supposed to know about.  Because of this, in my view, HZ and USER_HZ 
should be the same or USER_HZ should be greater than HZ.

_SC_CLK_TCK is a POSIX.1 definition and can't be changed.  But I don't 
think that there's any impediment to adding new parameters that can be 
reported by sysconf().

Making HZ == USER_HZ would also solve the problem.
