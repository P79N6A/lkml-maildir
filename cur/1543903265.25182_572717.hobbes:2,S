Shouldn't the return of kobject_set_name() be checked here?
[ Looking at code, and realizing that kobject_set_name() manages to
succeed even when given a null string! ]

Oh, that's kernel_param_sysfs_setup itself. So we actually need to
search for a built-in module in Michal's config that ... has an ... empty
