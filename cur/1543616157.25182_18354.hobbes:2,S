You can force a processor-reset in the simplist way, with an Intel
paged executive....
make a module that has open() only. Call it a character device with
some unused major number. Make a 'device', /dev/reboot with that
major number. 
Install it. When you want to re-boot, execute cat</dev/reboot
from your scripts after file-systems have been umounted.
The simple code in open() is:
   __asm__ __volatile__("movl $0, %%eax\n movl %%eax, %%cr0\n");
Actually, all you have to do is reset the paging-bit when executing
from an area in which there is not a 1:1 correspondence between
physical and virtual (like in the module).
This has worked on every system in which I have found the normal
shut-down code resulted in some strange start-up or a failure to
shut down.
This processor-reset starts execution at 0xffff0000, where the
BIOS ROM exists before it's shadowed, just like power-on.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
