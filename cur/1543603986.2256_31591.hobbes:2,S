Your disks go as fast as they go, that is a physical limitation. 
More RAM means your server can store up data blocks to be written when the
disks are less busy. But the data still has to be written to disk
sometime.
More RAM will certainly help by caching reads though.
6 disks raided together means the bottleneck will likely be your network,
unless your server is on gigabit ethernet and has a ton of clients and/or
gigabit to the desktop.
