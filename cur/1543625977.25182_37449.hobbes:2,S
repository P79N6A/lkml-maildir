I have a computer that on most web sites, ftp transfers or anything
related to the network
will start a connection and atart transferring for about 2 seconds and
then the connection
will die out.  This does not happen on all sites but with most.  When
booted into windows it has
no problem. It is very strange.  Have tried many different kernels
including 2.4.18 with no luck.
all info is below.  There seems to be no pattern also for this.  but it
doesn't matter 
it is ssh, http, ftp...they have this problem......any clues.
here are is all the info on the card
