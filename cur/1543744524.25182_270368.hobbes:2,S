Sure it does. Do something like this in a header file
	static inline int translate_irq_number(...)
	{
		#ifdef CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT
			return fn_ptr_xxx();
		#else
			return irq;
		#endif
	}
which means that yes, it uses the function pointer when it is meaningful, 
but if there is no point, the code just goes away.

At _least_ write out what the hell "gsi" is.
TLA's are bad. "gsi" apparently isn't the Geological Survey of Ireland, 
but that's all I can tell from google.
