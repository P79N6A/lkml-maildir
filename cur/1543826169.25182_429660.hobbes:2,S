Thanks, here is another bug. An address space beginning at 0 won't be 
de-registered. But this is not a big issue because 1. a configuration 
where a FIFO address space starting from 0 is impractical anyway (can 
occur if CONFIG_IEEE1394_SBP2_PHYS_DMA=N and physical DMA is unavailable 
from the host adapter, which won't work at the moment) and 2. the 
address space is a plenty resource (both as a bus address and with 
respect to the backing data structures) and 3. would be unregistered if 
the sbp2 module was unloaded. This is not critical for -stable.
On the other hand, if hpsb_unregister_addrspace(HL_driver, host, 
address) with address == ~0ULL (i.e. 
hpsb_allocate_and_register_addrspace failed before), it would do nothing 
but burn a few CPU cycles unsuccessfully searching for an address space 
starting at ~0ULL. Valid address spaces start at an address lower than 
CSR1212_ALL_SPACE_END == 1ULL << 48.
I will post a follow-up patch after breakfast, but it isn't relevant for 
-stable.
Thanks,
