Subject: small bugfix (was Re: 2.0.x networking breaks with SADISTIC_KMALLOC)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/7/18/14

In tcp_rcv (net/ipv4/tcp_input.c) we keep a ptr into the skb data in th.
Near the end th is referenced even though the skb at that point might
already have been kfree'd. This applies to 2.0 only, 2.2 doesn't free the
skb in the data and ack checks in tcp_rcv_established.
When th is corrupted all that happens is that we might lose an opportunity
to send a tcp frame and it will be sent at some later time. Very
annoying though, especially when debugging other stuff with
SADISTIC_KMALLOC (since then it's always corrupted :) 
Patch is against 2.0.37 but it looks the same in the other 2.0's so..
maybe there's a better fix.
