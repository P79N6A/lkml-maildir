It is not completely correct. You have to have per-mountpoint function
(ioctl) which allows you to pass pre-parsed timezone data into kernel.
Server uses its own local time, not yours. Although usually they are same,
currently I have mounted three ncpfs volumes, from different timezones.
Timestamps are wrong on all that filesystems, as expected... I will not 
accept any timestamp patch to ncpfs except one which correctly handles 
files created in past/future too, because of although current situation is 
not perfect, it is how things works for some years now...
