Too bad.

There is none.  And even System.map can be unreliable.  Some distros/kernels only include 
exported symbols in System.map, and sys_call_table is not exported in 2.6.

You don't.
You're just going to have to accept that fact that what you want to do, the way you want 
to do it, is just not going to happen.  Sorry.
Your best bet is to design and implement a clean and safe mechanisming for intercepting 
system calls, and submit that to the kernel.  It will probably get rejected, but it still 
might be worth a shot.
