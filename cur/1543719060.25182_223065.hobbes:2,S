It is indeed likely that the worst case is around 16000 writes, which if
on seperate tracks may take over 30 seconds to complete if done individually.
However, it's likely that any drive designer with a clue would allocate a
couple of journal tracks, so that the write cache and two backup copies can
be stored for replay when the drive is powered on again.
Why do I suspect that some designers don't have clue, or haven't really thought
enough about this case.
