When I boot up, the following message is displayed on the console:
ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc = 1a, key =  2, asc = 3a, ascq =  0
ide-tape: Can't get tape parameters - assuming some default values
ide-tape: hdd <-> ht0, 450KBps, 6*26kB buffer, 2600kB pipeline, 146ms tDSC
Is this a problem?  I've yet to purchase any tapes, so I have no way of
telling if this error is fatal or not.  Any tips would be appreciated!
