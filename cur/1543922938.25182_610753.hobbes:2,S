I really, really like this proposal. It is essentially what I have
always wanted.

I will try to do that as soon as possible. While I will strive to be
both clear and precise, achieving both is challenging. So, if someone
discovers a mis-match between the description and the code, would a
patch to the description be an acceptable resolution, if it did not
render the model silly?
