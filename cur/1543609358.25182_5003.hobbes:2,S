As it is, driver has a right to destroy any internal data structures as
soon as the last ->release() is called.  None of them expect requests
coming in after that and frankly, that makes sense.
IOW, if there is any point in _having_ ->release() at all, we'd better
make sure that nothing will bother the driver between the final ->release()
and the next ->open().
