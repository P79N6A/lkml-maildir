You're on crack as usual, but today you go much too far.  XFS doesn't
ahave anything to do with you're so Hard RT pipedreams.  The so-called
'RT' subvolulme only provides a more determinitistic block allocator.
GRIO doesn't require any RT guarantees, it's entirely about I/O scheduling
and has been ported to various operating systems with sane locking semantics.
