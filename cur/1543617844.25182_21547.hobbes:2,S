Depends on the OS.
Under Linux, PCI consistent allocation support is a requirement. Let me
cross fingers for this to stay as it is. :)
Under some other (NetBSD, for example, just not to name it :)), such
feature is just a hint and as a result drivers are theorically also
required to care about cache flushing for DMAs that involve driver
internal data structures if full portability is in concern. Btw, I donnot
really use NetBSD O/S but just ported sym-2 to it (NetBSD-1.5 with
coherency being a requirement for driver data structure allocations) as an
exercise.
