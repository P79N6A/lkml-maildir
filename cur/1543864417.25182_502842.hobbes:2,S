No, it's still there, and I just did a git clone on it.  How does it fail for 
you?  In any case, you're probably better of pulling from Stefans kernel.org tree:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ieee1394/linux1394-2.6.git
since that's where new work is going to show up.  I'm still trying to figure 
out a good workflow for this, but if all patches are going to through 
linux1394-devel, there's not much point in me publishing a branch in the 
freedesktop.org repo, if the patches are going to be edited/tweaked and the 
committed to Stefans repo.
