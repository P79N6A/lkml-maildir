Two questions:
  1. Does the size of the "appropriately sized journal (given the size
     of the filesystem)" vary with filesystem size?
  2. If so, does resize2fs change the journal size properly?
When I have resized ext3 filesystems, I have removed then recreated the
journal manually because it wasn't clear from the documentation whether
resize2fs does the appropriate thing.
Thanks,
