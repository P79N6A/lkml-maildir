Do you really need the audio card? :-) I'd toss (or disable) the audio
system in a heart beat just to remove the annoyance of the messages.

stable.
Do keep the F/W up-to-date if you should run into problems. The driver
is thin for this card, most stability issues center around targets,
target compatibility & Hardware (some issues can even trace to Power
Supply problems).
The 2200S is more than four times as fast (when stressed to the
maximum), the 2120S was meant for 'budget' scenarios with feature
completeness in mind.

I can put my hand on the CPU and keep it there with only a smidgen of
concern and nary a sizzling sound. I would worry if you could cook eggs
on it. Do you have a means to measure the actual temperature to add some
objectivism? If so, I'd compare it to the chip's (clearly marked, can be
substituted) specification maximums if you want to get more comfortable
with it.
