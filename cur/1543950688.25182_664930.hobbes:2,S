Actually no.
Greg: Use LSM for this
Pavel: My approach just makes maps per-group, while LSM will
       bring a new level of filtering/lookup on device open path

The fact is that we have users of OpenVZ and even Virtuozzo, that still use 
redhat-9 as in containers. So even if this is ready in 5 years, there will 
always be someone who sets the outdated (by that time) fedora-core-8 and find
out, that his udev refuses to work.

Agree, but we're talking about making old udev working with new kernel.
