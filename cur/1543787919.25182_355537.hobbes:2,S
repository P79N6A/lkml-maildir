Great.  Exactly.

Adaptec's SAS stuff implements the standard high level SCSI model as an 
API, which is a pretty decent direction for SCSI long term:  provides a 
transport-independent execute-scsi-command high level hook (along with 
the other task management functions), and hides the transport details 
for the most part.
That's fine, and works for iSCSI as well.
I just disagree that we need to have two concurrent APIs for SCSI, 
completely separate from each other, and mildly duplicating each other's 
code.
The current SCSI code will morph in the proper direction given time and 
love.  Segregating generic [SPI | FC | SAS | iSCSI | ATA | RAID | ...] 
transport layer code into their own modules -- the transport classes and 
associated libs -- will point out the sore spots where scsi-ml needs 
changes.  This approach also implies we improve the existing scsi-ml 
where needed, rather than the proposed "if legacy, let it bitrot" approach.
