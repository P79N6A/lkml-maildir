I'm trying to figure out how to do ISA DMA transfers. I can't figure out 
  how to satisfy all the requirements the ISA DMA controller sets. I've 
set a DMA mask of 0x00ffffff but mappings end up above the 16MB limit 
nonetheless. And I have no idea how to keep transfers within the same 
64k boundary.
I've been trying to figure out how other drivers do it but I can't see 
what I'm missing. And the documentation doesn't cover ISA DMA.
I'm basically stuck now so I'd appreciate any tips you can give me.
