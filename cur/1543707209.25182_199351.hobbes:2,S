Why the hell would it _ever_ do such normalization?

So what you are saying is that conversion of invalid multibyte sequences
into non-error wide chars followed by conversion back into UTF-8 can
lead to trouble?  *DUH*

The holes only arise because software which is interpreting UTF-8 doesn't
care to do it properly.  Software that doesn't interpret it (including the
kernel) doesn't enter the picture at all.
