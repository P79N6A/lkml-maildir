Fair enough! 
But we are not protecting the cpu_present_map here using
lock_cpu_hotplug(), now are we?
The lock_cpu_hotplug() here, ensures that no cpu-hotplug operations
occur in parallel with a processor add or a processor remove. 
IOW, we're still ensuring that the cpu_online_map doesn't change 
while we're changing the cpu_present_map. So I don't see why the name
get_online_cpus() should be a problem here. May be we could add a
comment as to why we don't want a cpu-hotplug operation to happen while
we're adding/removing a processor.
Unless of course, lock_cpu_hotplug() is also used to serialize 
the add_processor and remove_processor operations. Is that the case
here ?
Thanks and Regards
