You are correct.  modutils was never designed to run on one system and
handle modules created for another.  To make it endian safe, all
structures that are read or written from/to disk need a swab routine to
be called after reading and before writing that structure.  You also
have to consider word size differences, e.g. ix86 -> ia64 uses
different word sizes.  Not a trivial task.
Google for kallsyms_i386_ia64.c.  That is a hacked version of kallsyms
that runs on i386 and handles ia64 modules.  Different word size, same
endianess.  It is a starting point to hack a version for i386 -> ppc.
