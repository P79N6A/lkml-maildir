And the third one is also inappropriate by the definition of GFP_LEVEL_MASK
Christoph is using. If GFP_LEVEL_MASK is to be used to filter out flags
that are unsuitable for higher allocators such as slab and vmalloc, then
they shouldn't be using __GFP_MOVABLE because they are unlikely to do the
correct thing with the pages.
When the flags were added, I was treating GFP_LEVEL_MASK as a set of
allowed flags to the allocator.
