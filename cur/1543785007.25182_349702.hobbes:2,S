That's precisely what is does.  It's just that when there's taint other
than proprietary-module taint, it puts a "G" in that column instead of a
blank.  Which is oddly inconsistent, but whatever.
--b.
const char *print_tainted(void)
{
	static char buf[20];
	if (tainted) {
		snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "Tainted: %c%c%c%c%c%c",
			tainted & TAINT_PROPRIETARY_MODULE ? 'P' : 'G',
			tainted & TAINT_FORCED_MODULE ? 'F' : ' ',
			tainted & TAINT_UNSAFE_SMP ? 'S' : ' ',
			tainted & TAINT_FORCED_RMMOD ? 'R' : ' ',
 			tainted & TAINT_MACHINE_CHECK ? 'M' : ' ',
			tainted & TAINT_BAD_PAGE ? 'B' : ' ');
	}
	else
		snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "Not tainted");
	return(buf);
}
