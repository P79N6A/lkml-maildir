For example we could make a buffer to store all "unsent" data, and display
a message to the user that data needs to be "sent" to the device, and if
he could -PLEASE- replug it, and if it gets replugged, send all remaining
data.
I think this is the same as the FDD case: one can push the eject button at
any time, and if data needs to be written, tough luck. (not true on the
MAC IIRC, but that's not the issue here)
Essentially, I don't think it's really a linux-specific problem, since
such situations can happen on any OS. But it would be nice to have a good
way of dealing with it though, eg (maybe this is a stupid example) the
buffer thing I described above.
IMVHO, it's not only a PCMCIA problem, confer the FDD case mentionned a-
bove.

Just my 0.02 Euro anyway.
