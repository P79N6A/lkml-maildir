Fixed.

We're need to watch out for page faults after the shared mappings have
been taken down and mmap(2) trying to remap. I'll add a comment here.

Me being stupid. I followed what unmap_mapping_range_vma is doing but
failed to see what its callers are doing. I'll fix it up.

But it's good enough for generic_file_revoke, no? Ext3 should probably
implement it's own revoke hook so you can drop the ext2 and ext3 hooks
if you're worried, I did them mostly for testing.

What the comment says "make pending reads fail." When revoking an
inode, we need to make sure there are no pending I/O that will
complete after revocation and thus leak information.

I'll fix that up.

GFP_KERNEL should be sufficient. I'll fix that up.

Will do. Thank you Andrew.
