No.
Note that the features needed for (hard) RT and the ones needed for a
general prupose time-sharing OS can not be fulfilled at the same time.
Linux does not try to be a hard RT OS. A hard RT OS has to guarantee some
_maximum_ latencies (for event processing, interrupts, scheduling, ...),
which Linux can't. You may have a look a RT-Linux which targets to be a hard
RT OS and has gone quite far that way ...
However, there is also something called soft RT (POSIX) which can't
guarantee anything but provides means to tweak the scheduler amongst other
things. Soft RT performance can be measured in terms of _average_ latencies
and Linux is not that bad in this area.
