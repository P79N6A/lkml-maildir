Hi Suzanne,
Sorry about the late reply, I have been offline for a while.

Well, we use different methods of reference counting with
RCU based objects and fd table is one of those. With the
fd table, when you look up a file without holding
the fd table spinlock, the file structure you get may
be getting torn down on another CPU. We can safely
do this only if we *successfully* increment the reference
count of the file structure using atomic_inc_not_zero()
primitive which is based on cmpxchg. If atomic_inc_not_zero()
fails, we assume that the reference count of the file
structure had become zero and is getting destroyed.
If atomic_inc_not_zero() was successful, then we
"hold" a reference to the file structure and it is
safe to access it.

In both proc_readfd() and tid_fd_revalidate(), we don't access
the file structure itself in the lock-free section. We just
check if the file exists or not in the fd table. Worst case,
we may see state data in /proc.
