Hi,
Another day, another version.
Bugs fixed in this version: none
Known bugs in this version: none
In other words, it's perfect of course.
Changes:
- Added ide-dma segment coalescing
- Only print highmem I/O enable info when HIGHMEM is actually set
Please give it a test spin, especially if you have 1GB of RAM or more.
You should see something like this when booting:
hda: enabling highmem I/O
...
SCSI: channel 0, id 0: enabling highmem I/O
depending on drive configuration etc.
Plea to maintainers of the different architectures: could you please add
the arch parts to support this? This includes:
- memory zoning at init time
- page_to_bus
- pci_map_page / pci_unmap_page
- set_bh_sg
- KM_BH_IRQ (for HIGHMEM archs)
I think that's it, feel free to send me questions and (even better)
patches.
