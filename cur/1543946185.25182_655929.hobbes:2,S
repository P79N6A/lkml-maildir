So what is the MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES behavior?  Is it a combination of 
nodes_onto() and nodes_fold()?
In your example, the only way we know to use nodes_fold() is if the 
resultant of nodes_onto() has a weight of 0.  An MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES 
nodemask for 4-6, for example, works fine in your case of a cpuset with 
memory nodes 0-7 and no fold is required.
So it's easy enough to do this:
	case MPOL_INTERLEAVE:
		if (flags & MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES) {
			nodes_onto(pol->v.nodes, pol->user_nodemask,
				   cpuset_context_nmask);
			if (nodes_empty(pol->v.nodes))
				nodes_fold(pol->v.nodes,
					   pol->user_nodemask,
					   nodes_weight(cpuset_context_nmask));
		} else {
			...
		}
		break;
But what if we require a combination?  Say the user asked for a policy of 
MPOL_INTERLEAVE | MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES over nodes 4-8 in a cpuset 
constrained to mems 0-7?  Should the resultant be 0,4-7 (combination of 
nodes_onto() and nodes_fold()) or simply be 4-7 (just nodes_onto())?
And what if the MPOL_INTERLEAVE | MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES nodemask is 0,4-8 
in the same cpuset constrained to mems 0-7?  Should the resultant be
 - 0,4-7 (nodes_onto() and nodes_fold()),
 - 0,4-7 (just nodes_onto()), or
 - 0-1,4-7 (nodes_onto(), nodes_fold(), and shift)?
The last option, 0-1,4-7, is the only one that preserves the same weight 
as the relative nodemask.
