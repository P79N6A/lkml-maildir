vfsmount *mnt = do_kern_mount("proc", 0, "proc", NULL);
done at init time,
mntput(mnt);
at exit
and mntget(mnt) instead of your NULL in dentry_open().
Do not mess with get_fs_type() anywhere - the above will give you access
to procfs superblock just fine.
The real issue is what you are doing with procfs dentries there.  You do
*not* call ->d_revalidate().  And you do not evict these suckers when
procfs dentry goes away.  E.g. when process dies...
What the hell is going on with iget() calls, BTW?  Especially since all
of them get the same inumber...  Looks completely broken.
Why does is_pid() bother with checks for fs dentry belongs to?
copy_from_user() return value needs to be checked.
Use of file->f_pos is blatantly racy; don't do that.
->permission() is missing on hppfs; since procfs is not using generic one,
we have a problem.
read_proc() is a guaranteed fsckup if hppfs_open() is called with KERNEL_DS.
That's from the quick look through the current code...
