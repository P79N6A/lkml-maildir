Hmm... that is an odd one.  It looks like its crashing at
the first point we peek into a buffer_head attached to the
page given to xfs_count_page_state... the bh->state access
within buffer_uptodate here:
        bh = head = page_buffers(page);
        do {
                if (buffer_uptodate(bh) 
The page passed to releasepage is guaranteed locked and with
buffers attached, so there doesn't seem to me to be anything
XFS could have done wrong here - I suspect you may have some
memory problems (hardware) or else XFS is being called with
a page in an invalid state.  I can't see anywhere that that
might be happening though - both of the try_to_release_page
callers guarantee the page states I described above.
Running memtest for awhile seems to be the done thing in this
situation, see if that detects any problems.

I'll look into that, thanks.
cheers.
