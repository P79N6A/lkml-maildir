Subject: [PATCH 0/4] ppc64: updates for BPA platform
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

These are a few updates for the BPA platform of ppc64. Only the first
two patches are meant for inclusion, the others are provided here
for people who are running on Cell already and cannot wait for clean
versions of the patches ;-)
I also have lots of updates pending for spufs, but will send them
separately.
