I've taken the liberty of setting up an organizational web page for the purpose
of porting the current libc6 info pages to the man format.  It's an "ownership"
system where volunteers can claim ownership of current info files for porting
purposes.  I pounded it out after reading your message, so it's still pretty
raw.
The address is 
http://libc6man.mattshouse.com
The ftp address is ftp.mattshouse.com /pub/libc6man
Let me know if we'll need anything else (besides volunteers).
