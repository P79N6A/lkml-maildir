Hmm, I thought something like that. That means that I do need a complete
klibc based early userspace, just to get these two device nodes? Seems
like I'll have to do some deeper investigation of klibc; last time I
looked it didn't even compile for ARCH=um.

Just a relict from the default script; the first three lines should be
enought. But it shouldn't matter.

Is there any other known possibility to get just these two device nodes
in an automatic way? I'm trying to get rid of devfs, and udev works just
fine. The only thing not solved yet is how to get the beast started
without /dev/console and /dev/null. I don't want to create the nodes
statically, because that's only possible with root permissions. 
Some background: I'm building root filesystems for embedded systems with
PTXdist; the user is able to build the whole thing without root
permissions; either with a cross compiler and mount it via NFS or build
a JFFS2 image, or, with one switch, build and run it with an uml kernel.
I also tried ndevfs, just to get these two nodes, but I didn't find out
how to automatically mount it on boot yet.
