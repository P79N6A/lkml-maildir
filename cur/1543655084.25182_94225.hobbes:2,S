Sorry, "one would expect" is not sufficient grounds for incorporation of
a new allocator.  As far as I can tell, all the proposed users are in
fact allocating decent-sized aggregates, and that will remain the usual
case.
The code exists, great.  We can pull it in when there is a demonstrated
need for it.  But until that need is shown, this is overdesign.

If that's a problem it can be addressed in the slab head arrays - make
sure that they are always filled and emptied in multiple-of-cacheline-sized
units for objects which are smaller than a cacheline.  That benefits all
slab users.

I don't buy it.
- If the driver has two counters per device then the storage is
  infinitesimal.
- If it has multiple counters per device (always the case) then
  the driver will aggregate them anyway.
I am not aware of any situations in which a driver has a large
(or even medium) number of small, discrete counters of this nature.
Sufficiently large to justify a new allocator.
I'd suggest that you drop the new allocator until a compelling
need for it (in real, live 2.5/2.6 code) has been demonstrated.
