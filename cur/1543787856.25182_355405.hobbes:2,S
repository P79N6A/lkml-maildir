You mean something like "echo scsi-remove-single-device a b c d" >

I suppose ditto.

The way I've written my infrastructure, this seems as if it'll just
require another carefully placed hook function.

This shouldn't be hard since I already do a similar reset by resetting
udma_flags to a pre-init state.  Probably in an if (!(ap->flags &
ATA_FLAG_SATA)).

Hmm, this seems far more complicated... basically during a swap
operation, we have to shut down all I/O to the other drive on the
cable (if there is one), if I read you correctly, and then reconfigure
both drives once one is plugged in.
From what you're saying, it seems to me that the infrastructure I put
forth will work as is, plus some if statements and extraneous
PATA-only functions (and functionality like shutting down the other
disk on the cable until the user calls the 'warm-swap complete'
function').
How about this; I want this SATA hotswapping stuff to be tested, so
I'll commit my patches for 'SATA only' for the time being.  I'll stare
at them for a while and then see what kind of PATA-specific if
statements and hooks are necessary in the code?
