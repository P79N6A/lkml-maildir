Wow! Please delete CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED and make it always Y, then.
1. Box is running fine.
2. Kernel upgrade -- sysfs layout changes -- box breaks.
3. sysfs people tell everyone to upgrade userspace or turn on shiny new option
4. Some believe this, upgrades userspace. Option is not needed now,
BTW. It's turned off.
5. Several more kernel upgrades were fine.
6. 2.6.25-rc1 comes out and, who would have thought, requires to turn
on that damn
   option again or else box simply doesn't boot.
Why on earth do we have CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED at all if the only
sane choice for someone who tests new kernels is to always turn it on?
