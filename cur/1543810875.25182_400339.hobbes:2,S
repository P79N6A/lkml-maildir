Subject: [PATCH 08/23] proc: Kill proc_mem_inode_operations.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/23/149

The inode operations only exist to support the proc_permission
function.  Currently mem_read and mem_write have all the same
permission checks as ptrace.  The fs check makes no sense
in this context, and we can trivially get around it by
calling ptrace.
So simply the code by killing the strange weird case.
I admit the code has had this check since 2.2 but even
there it doesn't seem to make sense.
