It is the most closest to the superio subsystem mail list,
and all comments presented there about superio code were always right
and 
indeed usefull.
I believe I addressed them all(except function prefixes :) )

A bit offtopic: the reason why we have such long discussion about
superio 
is not that it is new, and you can see it if you dig the archive from
the 
beginning.

:) You misunderstand me, sorry.
I absolutely did not want to blame anyone and 
even did not have it in my thoughts :)

<not personal to you reasonings...>
Most objections are so small, that is can not be called problems.
I will fix it soon.
And I still do not see any problems there, I just do not want to spend
my time in such meaningless dispute about module names.
I'm not religious fanatic which will with foam at the mouth try to
make it's word latest.
I prefer to do interesting things and it is much easier to change the
module 
name than try to convince army of opponents :)
Superio design as actually another isssue, although I still do not
understand
why break well written working code just to what?
As I said, talk is cheap, if only discuss design notes, nothing can be
created.

And do I blame anyone?
Did I said that all you are fscking monsters that do not like my baby?
No, I presented the code and appreciate anyone's comments.
Thank you.

I do not say it to your personally, but in general:
Let's discuss the code, let's discuss the design, but do not try to
say, 
that code is bad just because one never see it before and it was just 
appeared here, and one do not understand something...
Most of the thread is not discussion...

Sure, I definitely will devote much time to document all pieces.

I mean above that we need to separate them logically from superio
access 
and i2c part.
But it is really better to have each logical device driver be a separate
module, 
it is just easier to search and handle.

As I saw from different documentation - logical devices itself are the
same.
And it is the same for superio standard.
For example sc1100 and pc87366 superio chips have the same logical
inside, 
although different logical device set.

Not only access.
Logic inside superio chip is submitted to superio standard.
I designed(at least tried to) superio subsistem
that it can handle all differencies using per device callbacks.

I definitely will do it.
Just get me time :)
