Hi Zwane,
I'm trying to update my patch based on the feedback from you. Updated
patch defines acpi_unregister_gsi() in both include/asm-i386/acpi.h
and include/asm-ia64/acpi.h. But now I'm having one concern about it.
Some arch specific functions would be called from acpi_unregister_gsi()
when it is implemented. But include/asm-xxx/acpi.h is included before
many other header files, so many 'implicit declaration of function xxx'
warning message would be appeared. These warning messages are disappeared
if we declare all functions called by acpi_unregister_gsi() also in
include/asm-xxx/acpi.h. But I don't like this approach very much.
After all, now I think it is better not to define acpi_unregister_gsi()
in header files.
How do you think?
Thanks,
Kenji Kaneshige
