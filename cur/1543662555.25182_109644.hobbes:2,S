Yay!  We noticed that if a controller fails in such a way that
no interrupts are generated then md driver doesn't notice anything is 
wrong.  Commands don't fail, but don't complete either.  I played around with
feature in the low level driver to periodically send a no-op command
down to the controller and fail all outstanding commands and disable
the controller if that command didn't come back pretty quickly, that 
seemed to work pretty well in a failover type situation. 
(Better than putting a timeout on every command.)  Also, md multipath 
doesn't notice if the backup path has failed, to warn the user that 
redundancy is no longer in effect.  (Though if you set up things so i/o 
is going down both paths, not such a big deal, as md will notice.
Probably you know all this already.

Well, the cciss driver is not a SCSI driver (except for purpsoes of 
tape drives & tape changers) and HP/Compaq has sold more than one 
million of those controllers (does popularity mean they aren't 
"weird"? :-), and we have mulitpath capable storage boxes they 
can connect to.
