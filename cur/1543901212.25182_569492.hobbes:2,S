That would be _so_ embarrassing in a library; I'd rather the audio
player had the opportunity to consider whether restarting was a good idea.

Or the user unplugs their flash drive after hibernation rather than before.
Two things which I think would be nice to consider are:
   1) Encryption - I'd actually prefer if my luks device did not
       remember the key accross a hibernation; I want to be forced to
       reenter the phrase.  However I don't know what the best thing
       to do to partitions/applications using the luks device is.
   2) Some level of debugging needs to be available so that users can
      provide something so you can see why something hasn't hibernated
      or why (as in the case of this tosh laptop) it still takes power
      during hibernation.
