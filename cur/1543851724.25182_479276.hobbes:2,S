I have a tool to write the eepro100 EEPROM.  Let me see if I can find it.
It even had all the default data coded, ready to restore a NIC to default.
However - back in the eepro100.c days, it was considered a warning only if
the EEPROM had a bad checksum.  There were two "supported" formats for the
EEPROM, one of which was just the MAC address.  And it worked!
