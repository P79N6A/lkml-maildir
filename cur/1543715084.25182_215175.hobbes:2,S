It seems that the driver allows non-exclusive access to the port - multiple
users may fight to set up the mode. How they will agree on which one to set?
On the other hand I do not want psaux to give me only exclusive access as
I have had emough of GPM repeater feeding X feeding Y ... etc.
It does not support active multiplexing controller (4 AUX ports) which
becomes quite common and is the only sane option when you have several
mice of different types.
Also I do not see where the code makes sure that it does not bind to
keyboard's port (so keyboard driver has to be loaded first).
I think the right way is to fix the issues with psmouse driver and use input
system to tie all hardware together.
