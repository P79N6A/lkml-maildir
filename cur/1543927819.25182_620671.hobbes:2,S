 I am sorry I couldnt respond in time, and also for creating the 
 confusion.  The previous fix did solve my problem.  However, if 
 for some other reason the card goes into an invalid state and a  
 write command fails, shouldnt we still check for the card state 
 before sending the next IO command?
