Could you explain for the audience the technical definition of fairness
and what sorts of error metrics are commonly used? There seems to be
some disagreement, and you're neutral enough of an observer that your
statement would help.

Carrying out this sort of analysis on various policies would help, but
I'd expect most of them to be difficult to analyze. cfs' current
->fair_key computation should be simple enough to analyze, at least
ignoring nice numbers, though I've done nothing rigorous in this area.
