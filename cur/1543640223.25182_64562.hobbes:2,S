Hi
1) I want to know about termcap formats. For example
the control sequence for del is "^[[3~" . So how
to interpret it. 
2) How will kernel decide keycodes, is it just based 
on termcap file. But this file does't contain
exhaustive list of keycodes.
Please mail me at venkatraghu2002@yahoo.com, I did't
subscribe to this list.
Regards
Venkat.
