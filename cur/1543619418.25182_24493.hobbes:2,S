Agreed.  Please have a look at what we're doing here:
   
http://killeri.net/cgi-bin/alias/ezmlm-cgi
It's too early to try the code, currently at version 0.0 (thanks to Rasmus 
Andersen for that, Kalle Kivimaa for the mail list).  The guilding design 
rule is to do everything with MTAs that submitters and maintainers _are 
already using_, and to do it _just as they do it now_, using a normal mail 
archive as the data base.  The only thing that changes is: you mail the 
patchbot instead of the maintainer.
Submitters will need to put some minimal number of additional lines in the 
body of the email, and it's possible we'll get the 'minimal number' down to 
zero for common cases (one line description comes from subject, long 
description comes from mail, purpose is implied by [BUGFIX] in subject line, 
etc).
Do you see anything to object to so far?
