Subject: bug in 2.4.22:  process left in 'T' state.

Hi,
I just noticed a very interesting behaviour which I haven't seen before.
I think it's a bug and very easily reproducible one too.
I was running in one session:
# tcpdump -i lo icmp
and in another session:
# strace -p 2117 -v
(2117 being the pid of tcpdump).
and in yet another session:
# ping -c 1 localhost
Now, after tcpdump captured the two icmp packets I waited until strace 
showed it blocked in the next recvfrom() system call and pressed ^C to 
terminate strace. It did terminate, but it left tcpdump in the 'traced' 
state and I couldn't do anything to kill tcpdump from within (i.e. all 
SIGINTs were blocked).
Re-running strace -p 2117 -c caused this:
~# strace -p 2117 -v
--- SIGINT (Interrupt) ---
and in the tcpdump session:
~# tcpdump -i lo icmp
tcpdump: listening on lo
15:07:09.442309 localhost.localdomain > localhost.localdomain: icmp: echo request (DF)
15:07:09.442372 localhost.localdomain > localhost.localdomain: icmp: echo reply
[1]+  Stopped                 tcpdump -i lo icmp
~# fg
tcpdump -i lo icmp
2 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
The two empty lines are my attempts to ^C which were ignored. Then, after 
I re-run strace tcpdump was stopped and then bringing it to foreground 
caused the SIGINT to be delivered and terminated as expected with the 
packet count/loss reported as normal.
Kind regards
Tigran
