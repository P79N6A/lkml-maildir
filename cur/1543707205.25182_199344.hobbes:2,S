I am, of course, working this angle as well.  However, I was hoping to
find out what, specifically, is causing these messages.  Preferably, how
to stop them or mute them for the short-term.  Having the log server
rotate 4GB log files every 24 hours because the kernel is almost DOSing
itself is counterproductive.
