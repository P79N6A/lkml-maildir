This is due to the __FUNCTION__ usages in this driver.  But this driver
has been broken for a while, so I've now fixed this problem, and am
working on the core functional problems.  I should have a new version in
a few days.
Do you have a machine that you use this driver on, that you would be
willing to help test any changes on?
thanks,
