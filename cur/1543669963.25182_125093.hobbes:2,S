A bit off-topic, but something tangentally related to this list...
Is anyone aware of a utility that helps with splitting a (large) patch 
into multiple patches at a hunk (or better, a sub-hunk) level?
I'm visualizing a GUI (or similar) that lets you right-click on a hunk 
and get a list of sub-patches or the option to create a new sub-patch, 
and moves the hunk to the selected sub-patch.  (I use the term 
'sub-patch', but in theory, you could load a set of patches, then 
shuffle hunks around.)  And lets you go to the sub-patches and move 
hunks from there to another patch.
A vim or emacs script/plugin would probably make the most sense.  (I'm a 
vim user, so I'm not familiar with what emacs provides, but I didn't see 
this functionality after a very quick look.)
I didn't have much luck with googling.  I think the words I used are too 
generic.  :/
Anyone know of something like this?
TIA,
Eli
