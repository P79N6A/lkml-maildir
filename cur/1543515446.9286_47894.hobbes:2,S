Since reformating the heavily used (and heavily fragmented) partitions on our
system (16 machines with 17Gbyte /local partitions that are used as scratch
space for number crunching applications) I have had no more "Access beyond end
of device errors".
Of course once the disks get heavily used enough to start being significantly
fragmented again and/or inodes start being re-used I'm guessing that I'll start
getting the errors again!
So my solution would be, if possible, to reformat any paritions that show this
problem!  Obviously not ideal if its your root partition.....
No doubt someone out there will prove me wrong.....
