If you're using urandom to move "a lot" of data, you're using it
wrong.  That's not what it is supposed to be for; I can't think of a
valid use of /dev/urandom that would use more than, say, 256 bytes
(2048 bits), and most sanely written users of /dev/urandom only need
16 bytes (i.e., 128 bits).  Anything more than that, and you should be
using a userpsace PRNG or CRNG, and **not** /dev/urandom.
