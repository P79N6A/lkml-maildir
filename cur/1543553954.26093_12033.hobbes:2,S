I've once again attached this very small patch for !CONFIG_INET.  Summary:
This is a very minor patch for fs/nls/Config.in, which Petr Vandrovec came up   
with.  The problem is that if CONFIG_INET is n, CONFIG_SMB_FS is never set
so fs/nls/Config.in assumes that the user wants to select some NLS options.
This fixes it and works on config/menuconfig/xconfig.  It's been ok'ed by
the SMB maintainer, so could this please go in?
This is still vs 2.4.10-test8 or so, but the file hasn't changed any, nor has
the problem, so...
