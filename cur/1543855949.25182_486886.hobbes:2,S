Subject: splitting work between user space program and the kernel

i am looking to write a cluster program to linux.
each linux node will have to be connected in the network to other node.
in each node the kernel will have to know the "network information"
since i dont want to do the network work in the kernel and i want it
to be done in user space, i ask what is the best way to split the work
between the kernel and user space application that will interact with
each other...?
thanks
