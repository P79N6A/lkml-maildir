the other possibility would be to not make linux_binfmt definitions
static and put appropriate prototypes in the fs.h header ... then you
could do:
if (current->binfmt == aout_format) {
  ... aout stuff ...
}
then again, this goes against the dynamic nature of the binfmt itself
... and the idea that the binfmt should not matter to anything else in
the kernel once it's executing ...
