oh very nice... no warnings on boot, and no warnings while i "dd 
if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/null" and i'm seeing 74MB/s+ from each disk on this 
simple read test.
for lack of a better test i started an untar/diff stress test on the 
disks... we'll see how it goes.  (it's based on doug ledford's 
memtest.sh)
thanks!
