I think there's a lot of that going around ... I don't think any of what you
mentioned was in the Documentation/pci.txt writeup, or any other source
of kernel documentation I found when I started to look at at that code!
That diagnosis works as well with the known facts as any other; maybe
better, considering some of the info I've collected offline.  And it could
also explain some other intermittent failures.

Good to know.  That'd apply for any register read, not just the
one that was written to, yes?
