Well ... a few hours ago I just finished the 'unrelated task' that kept
me from doing much cpuset work the last six months.
So, after a little bit of saved up vacation (SGI sabbatical - yippee!),
I should be able to dig into this, see what Dinikar and Cliff have been
up to here, and make some progress on this.  Cliff -- did I see some
work from you go by relating to cpusets and the sched domain hooks in
cpusets?
As before, Andrew, if you're getting bored holding this patch, it's ok
to drop it, even though I still figure you'll see it again, as part of
a patch set to improve this cpuset to sched domain interaction.
