But this is precisely the point.  A large number of drivers have purely
internal functions, which this is.  Most often, because the API is
purely internal to the driver, misuse is reported via BUG_ON (supposed
to be picked up by the driver writer in their testing).  The problem
with this is that we never do:
BUG_ON(ptr==NULL);
Because a simple use of the null pointer will also trigger the bug, so
we don't need the check.
I suspect table == NULL requires cur_column != NULL as part of the
internal API and there's no BUG_ON checking for it because the use of
the pointer would be the BUG.
If you blindly go checking for NULL and coping with it, you've actually
weakened our internal API checking, which definitely isn't the object of
the exercise.  Worse, becase we have no maintainer for this driver
someone touching it could easily get this wrong and a subtle and much
harder to find bug will be introduced.
So, as I said, if you can prove
table == NULL && cur_column == NULL
should be a genuine use case of the API then by all means, this can go
in.
