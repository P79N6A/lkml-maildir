Pretty much.  :)
However, this also is a good basis to point out that one of the big advantages with klibc 
is that you *can* share code with standalone userspace tools with relative ease.  For 
example, porting mdadm/Assemble.c to be a tool -- be it standalone or integrated into 
kinit -- is a pretty trivial project, whereas trying to integrate code like that into the 
kernel proper is a major task.
As you can also notice, a number of modules of kinit are also available as standalone 
programs (and, in fact, I have already gotten requests to break out additional modules in 
the same way.)  This means that that code is available to distributions to use in their 
initramfs solutions, without having to take the kinit package.  Finally, unlike the 
current code, kinit can be wrapped, as is, from a script.
