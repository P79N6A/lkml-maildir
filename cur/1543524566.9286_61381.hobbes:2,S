I have thought about this and we cannot do that.
Imagine a TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE task in a critical piece of code
(well, why would it be TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE otherwise) that
suddenly becomes TASK_RUNNING, gets a signal (where it does the
schedule) and breaks out of the critical piece of code in an
unclean way...
Since we cannot have that and the trap is there only to detect
buggy callers, it is the simple one we have now. Trust me, I
have tried to come up with an all-in-one solution...

Rik
