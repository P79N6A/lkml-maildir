New core, common and ia64 code for kbuild 2.5 is available in
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=18813&release_id=83065
Changes from core-2 to core-3.
  Ensure that database records are aligned.  Do not assume that keys
  are aligned (all the world is not a 386).
Changes from common-2.4.18-1 to common-2.4.18-2.
  Minor changes to common code to suit ia64.
New, ia64-020226-2.4.18-1.
core-3 works on ia64, it should work on other architectures that have
alignment requirements such as sparc.
Other architecture maintainers can use core-3 and common-2.4.18-2 as a
starting point for porting this release of kbuild 2.5 to their
architecture.  The existing arch patches from Release 1.12 are a good
starting point, ia64 was almost unchanged from Release 1.12 to 2.0.
I have not tested any of the kbuild 2.5 code on big endian machines.
It should work as is but it would be nice to have it confirmed.
