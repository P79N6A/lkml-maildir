Actually, I'd rather see the _drivers_ do most of the fixups for their own
chips, and leave the global PCI fixups for things like
 - PCI/ISA/whatever bridges that affect drivers for _other_ chips. I hate
   having some random PCI driver having to know about the fact that it
   might be behind a bridge that needs special initialization. That kind
   of "non-local" knowledge is that the PCI fixups are there for.
 - stuff that needs to be fixed up early in order to have a working system
   and make sure that we don't have any resource clashes we can't fix up
   later on.
But if there is a BIOS/chip bug that affects only one driver, and that bug
is local to that driver only and can't affect anything else, then I'd
rather see the driver keep track of it. It's easy enough for a driver to
do any required fixup before it actually calls "pci_enable_device()".
