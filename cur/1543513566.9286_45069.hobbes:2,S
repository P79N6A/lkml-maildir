I've already sent a very large patch to Alan a couple of days ago, which
removes all the schedule_timeout's from the lower parts of the IrDA
stack. Instead I'm impl. things as state machines and do the timeouts using
timers. Some code can look a bit hairy because of this, but it's working
quite well.
struct irda_task;
typedef int (*TASK_CALLBACK) (struct irda_task *task);
struct irda_task {
	queue_t q;
	magic_t magic;
	TASK_STATE state;
	TASK_CALLBACK function;
	TASK_CALLBACK finished;
	struct irda_task *parent;
	struct timer_list timer;
	void *instance; /* Instance being called */
	void *param;    /* Parameter to be used by instance */
};
... then I can do things like this to make timeouts:
int tekram_reset(struct irda_task *task)
{
	dongle_t *self = (dongle_t *) task->instance;
	int ret = 0;
	DEBUG(2, __FUNCTION__ "()\n");
	ASSERT(task != NULL, return -1;);
	
	/* Power off dongle */
	self->set_dtr_rts(self->dev, FALSE, FALSE);
	switch (task->state) {
	case IRDA_TASK_INIT:
		irda_task_next_state(task, IRDA_TASK_WAIT1);
		/* Sleep 50 ms */
		ret = MSECS_TO_JIFFIES(50);
		break;
	case IRDA_TASK_WAIT1:
		/* Clear DTR, Set RTS */
		self->set_dtr_rts(self->dev, FALSE, TRUE); 
		irda_task_next_state(task, IRDA_TASK_WAIT2);
		
		/* Should sleep 1 ms, but 10 should not do any harm */
		ret = MSECS_TO_JIFFIES(10);
		break;
There are a couple of helping functions as well, but I guess you get my
point. 
The reason is that the lower part is interrupt driven, and I previously had 
to use a user-space daemon to help me get the process context for doing
schedule_timeout. Now there is no need for such a deamon anymore (at least
if my patch goes in, and when I have done a few more patches to IrLAN ;-)
Anyway, thanks for the info.
