In 2.2 it was not safe to swap to a RAID array that we being resyched
or was having a spare reconstructed, but in 2.4 it is perfectly safe.
It would be entirely appropriate for the init.d script to check for
version >= 2.3.9pre8 (I think that is when the new resync code went
it) - or probably just >= 2.4.0, and bypass any fancy checks if that
is the case.
