So, this may already be asked and answered (apologies if it has), but is 
it worth gpg-signing submissions so that authenticity can be verified to 
some degree when a patch is posted (and for archival purposes)? I ask 
because this is whats done on the fedora extras channel when updates get 
pushed, and it seems like a reasonable addition to the process.
