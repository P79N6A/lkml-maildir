I don't understand this.
Let's take the simplest possible example (self-monitoring per-thread)
counting one event in one data register.
int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	int ctx_fd;
	pfarg_pmd_t pd[1];
	pfarg_pmc_t pc[1];
	pfarg_ctx_t ctx;
	pfarg_load_t load_args;
	memset(&ctx, 0, sizeof(ctx));
	memset(pc, 0, sizeof(pc));
	memset(pd, 0, sizeof(pd));
	/* create session (context) and get file descriptor back (identifier) */
	ctx_fd = pfm_create_context(&ctx, NULL, NULL, 0);
	/* setup one config register (PMC0) */
	pc[0].reg_num   = 0
	pc[0].reg_value = 0x1234;
	/* setup one data register (PMD0) */
	pd[0].reg_num = 0;
	pd[0].reg_value = 0;
	/* program the registers */
	pfm_write_pmcs(ctx_fd, pc, 1);
	pfm_write_pmds(ctx_fd, pd, 1);
	/* attach the context to self */
	load_args.load_pid = getpid();
	pfm_load_context(ctx_fd, &load_args);
	/* activate monitoring */
	pfm_start(ctx_fd, NULL);
	/*
	 * run code to measure
	 */
	/* stop monitoring */
	pfm_stop(ctx_fd);
	/* read data register */
	pfm_read_pmds(ctx_fd, pd, 1);
	printf("PMD0 %llu\n", pd[0].reg_value);
	/* destroy session */
	close(ctx_fd);
	return 0;
}
