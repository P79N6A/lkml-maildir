Do note that www2.kernel.org has a load that is usually 1/20th of 
www1.kernel.org; apparently due to Microsoft DNS braindamage (which 
affects anyone whose ISP uses MS-DNS.)  Using www2.kernel.org explicitly 
is likely to give you better performance.  HOWEVER, performance is going 
to suck due to the measures we've had to take on the servers regardless, 
and it's entirely likely git-rss is totally broken.  Again, we should 
have a dedicated git server in operation in about a month.
