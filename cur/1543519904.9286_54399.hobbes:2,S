It's SMP safe:
You are using the current _thread_ pointer, and since a thread can never
run on more than one cpu at the same time, you don't need a lock. A user
space programm could read the counters for all thread that belong to a
process, and then it could print the result. AFAIK the kernel has no
concept of "process", it only deals with threads.
