The preferred build command for gcc is
$ make bootstrap
AFAIK that compiles the compiler in three stages.
stage1 => normal with currently installed compiler
stage2 => with stage1 compiler
stage3 => I don't know. Either with stage1 or stage2.
So if you built it with bootstrap it's impossible to have
bad or good performance, just because it was built this
this or that compiler.
Please correct me if I'm wrong. :)
