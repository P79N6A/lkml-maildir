I suspect it should be possible to do this much cleaner with the new
Kconfig system.  For example, if all PCI-dependent drivers really do
specify "depends on PCI" (or something equivalent), then a good
portion of the hopeless drivers would automagically go away from the
simulator configuration.  What's there now "works", but it clearly
could stand some modernization.
