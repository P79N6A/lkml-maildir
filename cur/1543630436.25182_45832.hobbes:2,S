What if the fault handler does a fault  ( like seg fault in seg fault handler 
)  , cause in i386, i remember such a situation causes a processor reboot as  
it becomes a infinite loop !
the same code works fine on an iPAQ  ! without any problems 
and i did a diff of the strace output on iPAQ and GCP and found that the 
following lines are extra in case of iPAQ while GCP reboots before it can 
print the lines !
***************************************
brk(0xc8000)                                         = 0xc8000     
close(4)                                                 = 0                
close(3)                                                = 0                   
munmap(0x40000000, 4096)                 = 0                   
_exit(0)                                                = ?
*****************************************
so i conclude that the system crashes in brk() sys call !
If you can point out  the cases where the kernel reboots without showing any 
message ,   then it will be easier to debug for me! 
and thanks a lot for the reply  :)
