Here's some data I've collected on a possible related or identical one.
So far it seems related to interface removal. I've seen this recently on 
vlan interfaces, since ifupdown on my systems kill vlan devices on ifdown.
In my cases I've not been able to reproduce without ipv6 loaded in the 
kernel, and it only seems to happen when lo/loopback is taken offline 
first (ifdown -a here does it in that order..)
A shutdown rrmod-type takedown of a NIC would probably be run after 
"ifdown -a", hence after lo is down, thats why I suspect it to be the 
same problem.
I still have a binary search to do for pinpointing what broke it, though.
