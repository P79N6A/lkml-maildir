It's hard to compare 2.4 and 2.5 on this one.  2.5 will start writing to disk
much earlier, and that additional I/O can sometimes get in the way of other
disk operations.  The end result is that the test exits leaving more (or
less) dirty data in memory and the time for writing that out is not
accounted.
You need to either run a much longer test, or include a `sync' in the
timings.
But in this case (assuming you're using ext3), the difference is probably
explained by a timing fluke - the test on 2.4 kernel happened to cover three
ext3 commit intervals while the 2.5 test squeezed itself into two.
Hard to say - there are a lot of variables here.

Could be ext3 effects as well.  Also maybe some differences in page aging
implementations.

cmp needs to use a larger buffer ;)

Again, depends on how much of /tmp/q was left in pagecache.

It doesn't seem to be from the above numbers?

Could you boot with elevator-deadline and retest?
How large are the dictionary files?
