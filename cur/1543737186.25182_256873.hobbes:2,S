I'm not disagreeing with this, at all.
Most distributions ship kernel headers that have somehow been sanitized.
The canonical structure is still the thing located in inotify.h, though,
whether or not it is 'kept aligned by the human brain' or used
wholesale.
The structure needs to be used exactly the same between the kernel and
the user.  We both agree to that, right?  It is user visible.
