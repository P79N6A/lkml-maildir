Here is my reply.  Your spam filter is STILL bouncing my mail.

Are you saying DCANet is a spamhaus?  That is crazy, we are an ISP with
15,000 customers, of course you have received spam from them once or
twice.  All we can do when we catch a customer spamming (usually due to
a hacked machine) is terminate their access.  We cannot go back in time
and un-send the spam.
I have never had anyone on LKML bounce mail from DCANet.  So, the
problem is at YOUR END.
If you are accusing DCANet of being a spamhaus then please forward me
one shred of evidence that DCANet has ever spammed you.

Anyway, just to keep this thread from being a completely OT waste of
time, the code that your patch removes was put there for a reason.  It
fixes a security hole.  There was a long thread about it on LKML last
month.  Posting a patch that just rips this code out is not productive.
