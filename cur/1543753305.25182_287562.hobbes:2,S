Thanks looking at this issue. We (intel ACPI team) have many discussions
about this issue. Actually this problem isn't so easy. The warning is
when doing resume PCI link device with interrupt disabled. A more
important issue is suspend/resume is doing with all processes frozen,
which will cause many issues such as semaphore, memory mapping, kmalloc.
The real solution is on going. I'll let you know when it's ready.
Thanks,
Shaohua
