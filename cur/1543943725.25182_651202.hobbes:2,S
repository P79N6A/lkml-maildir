Hi Folks,
Having recently upgaded my Ubuntu install from Gutsy to Hardy, my 750GB
Seagate disk connected via a SiI680 PCI card is no longer detected.  I
suspect this is caused by the MMIO changes in 2.6.24.  Strangely in 2.6.22
the drive appears as sda1, but on 2.6.24 it appears as a non functioning
hde.

Note, my bios does not support 750GB drives, so the drive is not
configured in the card BIOS.  This has not stopped linux detecting it ok
in the past.
Please let me know if I need to provide any more information or additional
testing.
Thanks
