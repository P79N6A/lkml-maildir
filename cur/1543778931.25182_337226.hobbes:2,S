Interesting. I mount all my USB drives and players with async option - and 
they do use vfat. There is no problem on unmount, they complete the sync. 
(Though btw, the drive's led still flashes after umount has returned.)
For USB 1.1 devices, it takes a little longer since the buffer cache or 
something like that is so big.
