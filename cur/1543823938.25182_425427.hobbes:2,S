It's actually for hostname.  It looks to me like they are used
interchangeably.  yes/no?
gethostname:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/gethostname.html
sysconf:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/sysconf.html
unistd.h:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/unistd.h.html
limits.h:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/limits.h.html
From the latter:
{HOST_NAME_MAX}
    Maximum length of a host name (not including the terminating null) as returned from the gethostname() function.
    Minimum Acceptable Value: {_POSIX_HOST_NAME_MAX}
(and)
{_POSIX_HOST_NAME_MAX}
    Maximum length of a host name (not including the terminating null) as returned from the gethostname() function.
    Value: 255
