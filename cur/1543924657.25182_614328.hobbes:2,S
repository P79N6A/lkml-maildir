For the last release, I stated that I thought the 2.6.22.12 release
would be the last one in the 2.6.22.y series.  Since then, I've received
a number of other patches that would be nice to have in the .22.y tree.
So, for a while, I'll keep the 2.6.22.y tree open, doing new releases
every once in a while as they accumulate.  I do this, for no other than
the selfish reason that I use it every day on my openSuSE 10.3 boxes as
that is the kernel base that release is on :)
If anyone has any objections or questions about this, please let me
know.
thanks,
greg k-h
