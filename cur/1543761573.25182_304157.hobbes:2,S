There is data excess data structure but it fits fine.  You simply
allocate one region and set PG_reserved on all of the pages that
the OS does not have access too.  Trivial and you don't have
to hack anything.
Larger than 4K granularity pages are important for performance reasons
in a number of contexts.  The primary reason is the large pages allow
a reduction in tlb misses.  But it is worth noting that DRAM pages
can be as large as 32KiB.  So there are other cases where there are
benefits in dealing with contiguous memory addresses besides reducing
the tlb miss count.

You also have broken kexec.  
And how well does hugetlbfs work under Xen?

For this specific case there may be another resolution but could
you please, please look at marking the missing pages PG_reserved
and not hacking phys_to_virt.
At this point anything short of explicitly introducing an intermediate
step say virt_to_logical() logical_to_virt() will be extremely
confusing and lead to very hard to spot bugs.  Silently changing
the semantics of functions is bad.
