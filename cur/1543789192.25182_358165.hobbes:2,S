Ingo,
   Good news and strange news:
GOOD NEWS: This problem may or may not be fixed in 2.6.14-rc4-rt5. The
kernel now boots for me with IRQoff tracing enabled, but once again
I'm seeing times that appear to be the timer frequency:

STRANGE NEWS: It now takes between 1-2 minutes for Gnome to log out.
I think possibly something is not exactly right about the timers yet.
