Couldn't really decode your oops but I'm pretty
sure you were out of memory suitable for DMA
under the 16 MB level and oopsed on a memset()
that assumed a scsi_init_malloc() would always
work. I have had several oopses loading up scsi 
cdrom drives and this was the cause.
There is a "fix" for it in 2.2.10-ac1+ that
checks and returns an error. So you still won't
get your cdrom working in this situation but at 
least the kernel won't oops :-)
Jaroslav Kysela has a great patch that would
really fix this. See:
http://www.alsa-project.org/~perex/page_alloc.html
Do we have to wait for 2.3/4 for this? Several
sub-systems within the kernel get this problem
in 2.2 (eg SCSI and sound).
