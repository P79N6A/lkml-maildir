	If you allow it to be used by non-privileged processes, you create the
potential for an untrusted process to cause ridiculous amounts of physical
I/O. Although one could argue that an untrusted process can currently cause
as much damage by repeatedly reading sequentially through a file much larger
than physical memory.
