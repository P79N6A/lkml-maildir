There really are only two ways to deal with this -- drop the memory 
(which should be automated, and a warning printed) or adjust the MTRRs. 
  The problem is that at some point we run out of MTRRs, partially 
because they're masks instead of base/limit.
Even use of PAT doesn't trivially resolve this issue with less than 
doing MTRR emulation via PAT (setting the default MTRR to WB); however, 
that is bound to cause trouble with SMM.
