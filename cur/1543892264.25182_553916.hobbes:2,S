Subject: [PATCH 0/2] generic LED driver

Hello,
This generic LED driver implements the code common to all LED 
drivers while delegating actual LED accesses to platform supplied 
code. This allows exotic platforms to declare their LEDs in a few 
line of codes rather than reimplementing a complete LED driver.
I send it in two patches since you may want to apply the first 
trivial patch even if you do not consider the LED driver 
interesting enough for inclusion.
Regards,
Robin
