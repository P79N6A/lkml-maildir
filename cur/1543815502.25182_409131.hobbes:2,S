Could you, BTW, please post these pending patches? They are clearly not
in -mm, since these patches have been there for some time without
conflicting with anything else. The only references I could find were to
the following thread:
   
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.file-systems/7748
which basically just adds a BUG() if you call NFS O_DIRECT with a
multi-segment iovec.
I can't see from those patches how Chuck's O_DIRECT changes can be
construed as being "counterproductive". AFAICS those changes are
completely orthogonal to your proposal.
Cheers,
  Trond
