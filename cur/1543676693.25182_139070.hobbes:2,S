yes it does when you call select
take a probgram thats sharing the same cosket between 2 processes
or a multithreaded program sharing any socket from the time
that select is called and read / write is called the data
or buffer form the socket could have been completly filled or completly 
emptyed.

nobody said it was illegla but in certin situations it
might as well count as a nop;

if you are on a udp socket say you have host a host b and host c
host a and host b are on the same network host c is on another networked
connected by 512kbit link (faster / slower) and you are calling select on
host a. host b blast a silly amount of data to host c
host a does the same. What happen ? who wins ?

Same as a multithreaded program select could say its ok to write when you
write data it could be a completly different story
