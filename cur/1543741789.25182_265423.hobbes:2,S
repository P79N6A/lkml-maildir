How would one go about having a specific syscall number reserved in
entry.S?  I'm exploring doing a kill inside the kernel from a detection
done in userspace, which would allow the executable header of the binary
to indicate whether the task should be killed or not; if it works, the
changes will likely not go into mainline, but will still require a
non-changing syscall index (assuming I understood the syscall manpage
properly).
On a side note, if a syscall doesn't exist, how would that be detected
in userspace?
