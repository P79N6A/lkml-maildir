yes.  Intuitively, a process w/o some permitted capability should _never_ 
(unless fP != 0) get that capability back by calling exec.  This happens in 2.4 
and 2.6 in a worse way right now, though.  Any uid=0 process that calls exec (if 
cap_bset is untouched) will regain all capabilities, making it (mostly) 
ineffective to restrict root processes.  At the same time, non-root processes 
with extra caps can't usefully call helpers.  I think this is the problem you 
originally noticed.

Maybe I misread the spec, but I thought it explicitly stated
pP' = (fP & X) | (fI & pI)
(I can't find it right now, though...)

I would hope that, on a system that supports file capabilities, a file w/o 
capabilities set and w/o setuid would behave exactly like a file with some 
"default" capabilities.  In my patch, these capabilities are (=ei).  In mainline 
Linux, there is no such capability set (witness the logic in 
cap_binprm_set_security).
As a test, this is IMHO correct: (-test-6 + my patch + both options on)
$ cp `which bash` .
$ chmod 4755 bash
$ su
Password:
# ./bash -p
$ dumpcap [a trivial program I wrote]
         Real        Eff
User    0           500
Group   0           0
Caps: =ip
The bash -p process has uid = 0, euid = 500.  When it execs dumpcap, neither its 
uid nor its euid change, so, in traditional POSIX, it should have no effective 
capabilities (as it acts like uid 500).  (Should it have CAP_SETUID?  My patch 
doesn't change this behavior, but I'm not sure it's correct right now.)
With the (POSIX) rule pE' = pP' & fE, the dumpcap process would have been uid=0, 
euid=500, and all caps effective, which is inconsistant with traditional 
semantics.  Linux currently works correctly because fE and fP are dependent on 
initial uid and euid.
