Roughly 400 MB of swapout. And two seconds isn't that bad ;-)

I don't understand why an ouch-per-second is reasonable. The mempig is
the only process that runs on the machine and the blk_congestion_wait
uses HZ/10 as timeout value. I'd expect about 100 ouches for the 10
seconds the test runs.
The 4x performance difference remains not understood.
