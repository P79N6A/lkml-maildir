Yes.

I was just trying to get across the reversible nature of this kind 
of externally induced error. Richard's analogy was that scrubbing memory 
is like picking scabs. Perhaps immune reaction would be closer, because 
it tends to detect and fix small problems before they become big problems.
I don't think anybody is going to be convinced here. Sounds like the 
issue is not a lack of information. I like your car analogy - I had 
a very similar road trip between Missouri and Florida. 
Best regards,
