__save_flags() and check IIRC bit 9 - but I doubt that this is your
problem.

Backtraces contain stale functions from previous calls.
The first entry is always correct, then you must manually check that the
calls are possible, i.e.
> Trace; c011b548 <do_exit+3b4/3d4>
> Trace; c0107a38 <do_divide_error+0/9c>
> Trace; c0113683 <do_page_fault+3f3/510>
> Trace; c0113290 <do_page_fault+0/510>
either do_page_fault or do_divide_error are stale.
+0 means that someone pushed the function address on the stack - if a
function calls another function, then the offset is at least +6 on i386.
check if do_page_fault+3f3 actually calls do_exit, and if do_exit+3b4
calls exit_notify etc. Try clear all stale entries from the callchain.
Note that the address pushed is behind the call instruction, and call
instructions are usually 5 or 6 bytes long. Disassemble from +3d0 and
check the call.
And are you sure that schedule() was actually called from within an
interrupt? I don't see the do_IRQ()//handle_IRQ_event.
I bet it was a schedule() within spin_lock_bh().

Which network card do you use?
Networking is the main user of spin_lock_bh(), and since 2.4.4 zero-copy
networking is merged.
Good luck,
