Hmmm... I have experienced some hard locks similar to what 
you describe: if I compile usb-uhci as a module, Phoebe3 
(8.0.94) locks hard at the time of doing a "modprobe 
usb-controller" (being usb-controller an alias for uhci-hcd) 
during boot (rc.sysinit script). To fix this, I have had  to compile 
usb-uhci in to the kernel and then fix rc.sysinit. I haven't tried 
using usb-uhci as a module since then. 
 
What's curious is that doing a "modprobe usb-controller" by 
hand doesn't cause hard locks. So, there must be some kind 
of timing or interaction that's causing rc.sysinit to invoke 
"modprobe uchi-hcd" and freeze the machine. Any ideas?
