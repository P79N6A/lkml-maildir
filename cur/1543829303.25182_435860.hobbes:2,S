Subject: Is the x86-64 kernel size limit real?

I get bitched at by the build process because the kernel I get is
around 4.5Mb compressed.  i386 does not have that limitation.
Interestingly, a diff between the two build.c gives:
--- ../../../i386/boot/tools/build.c	2006-06-22 20:19:33.000000000 +0200

which shows two things:
1- a8f5034540195307362d071a8b387226b410469f should have a x86-64 version
2- the limit looks entirely artificial
So, is removing the limit prone to bite me?
  OG.
PS: Please do not turn this thread into a pro/against modules ones, TYVM.
