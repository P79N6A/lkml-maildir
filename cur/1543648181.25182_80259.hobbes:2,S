We originally did have a fs based interface written by Steve
Whitehouse.  However at the time (about a year ago) it wasn't obvious
that everyone would think it a good idea.  Also the code was
significantly larger than the ioctl interface.  I would be more than
happy to do away with the ioctl stuff if people are now in full
agreement that an fs interface is the way to go.
