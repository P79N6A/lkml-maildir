I suppose you mean that control pages have additional protection that
struct kimage does _not_ have. Protection provided by
kimage_alloc_control_pages(), right?
I agree with you that this protection is good. But I do not see how
that applies to my patch, because the page_table_a[] pages pointed out
by struct kimage are read out by machine_kexec() and passed as
arguments to the assembly code. So the assembly code itself never
tries to access struct kimage. All data accessed by the assembly code
is allocated with kimage_alloc_control_pages(), isn't that good
enough? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding?
On top of that I fear that my patch likes the fact that the assembly
code in the control page is page aligned. But it is probably no biggie
to change. I'm just lazy. =)

I used struct page *[] because the control page was a struct page *. I
never use the contents of what the struct page points to, I only use
them to convert to physical/virtual addresses or pfns. So I would say
that no extra dependencies are introduced at all actually. But I may
be wrong.
I would be happy to change the struct page *[] to unsigned long [] or
something else, but I must say I like the typing that struct page
provides.
Regarding storing the just root page or all pages - I stored all pages
because I need to pass them to the Xen hypervisor which will fill in
new values in page_table_a. page_table_b OTOH never gets modified by
the hypervisor, which is why page_table_a is an array of pointers and
page_table_b is just a root pointer.

Sure. I just thought that one page table with a mix of 4K pages and
huge pages would result in difficult code. The current page_table_a
code is actually more or less the same on x86 and x86_64, with the
exception of some macro magic.
Thanks for the detailed reply!
