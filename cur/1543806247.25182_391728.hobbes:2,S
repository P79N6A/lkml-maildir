Just printk() the exact driver specific low-level error, even if non-fatal.
Single non-fatal errors just show your system recovers correctly.
Multiple (e.g. noisy) non-fatal are either an indication of a serious 
problem
  (e.g. after how many corrected ECC errors on the same address in which
    time interval will you replace your dimm? How many S-ATA CRC-errors
     will indicate marginal bad cabling? )
or it shows the problem needs to be root analyzed. But don't disable the
messages as this will only hide the real problem.
Concerning Non-Fatal PCI Express errors, the error cause registers need
to be printed in case of error, too (see Intel Chipset Specifications)
