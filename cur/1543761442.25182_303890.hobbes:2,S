I couldn't agree more. Problem is I've been asked to change the way mem=X 
works on PPC64 so that this hack will work, which is a horrible thought.

No I can't. I've been approached by several "vendors" asking about using mem=X 
hacks on PPC64, however I doubt any of them have code in-tree. I'll check 
though.
