Subject: [PATCH] mutex: set owner only once on acquisition
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/15/78

mutex_lock() sets the lock owner, no need to set it upfront in
__mutex_lock_common().
Inside __mutex_lock_common() we can cope with the case where the
successful acquirer got preempted by us before setting the owner
field: there is an explicit check in the spinning code and the
sleeping part doesn't rely on it.
The debug code does owner checks only on unlock where the field is
garuanteed to be set.

Just a small observation.  Peter said it wouldn't matter much as the
write is to a hot cache line.  But otoh, why keep it if it's not
necessary. :)
