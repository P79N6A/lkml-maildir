Please tell me exactly how you're using it: how many filesystems, how
many controllers, disk topology, physical memory, size of filesystems,
etc.  Sufficient for me to be able to reproduce it and find out what
is happening.
Also: what is your best-case aggregate bandwidth?  Platter-speed of disks
multiplied by number of disks, please?
Thanks to the BKL you've effectively got 1.3 to 1.5 CPUs, but we should be
able to saturate six or eight disks on a uniprocessor kernel.  It's
possible that we're looking at the wrong thing.
