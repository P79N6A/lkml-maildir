You get an additional process slot, which is not to be sneezed at.
More significant, though, you have a guarantee that data is flushed
back within some short period of time, no matter what state the system
is in.  You don't seem to think this is important, but to anyone who
maintains a server with key data on it, it is *critical*.
I also think that with update rolled into bdflush, it will be possible
to do the job faster and with less bottlenecking.  See below.
I see Linus has backed out the changes in 2.2.9 and 2.3.1, which is a
relief, now we can iterate on this and get it working properly.

You may be right.  There's a huge race in wakeup_bdflush.  If asked to
wait, it calls run_task_queue(&tq_disk) after waking bdflush but
BEFORE sleeping on bdflush_done.  That's been there for a really long
time, I guess it is easier to trigger with my changes applied.
There's no good reason to run that task queue there; bdflush always
does it right before waking up bdflush_done anyway.  That line should
just be dropped out.  I see 2.2.8_arca1 has wakeup_bdflush never
block; instead you call flush_dirty_buffers directly.  I'm not sure
that's a good idea; can you justify it?

Steve explained this, but I will add a bit to it.  Recompile buffer.c
of 2.2.7 with DEBUG defined and run bonnie on an idle system with no
syslogd.  You will see many messages that look either like
bdflush() activated...sleeping again.
or
Wrote 0/2345 buffers.
The first message is what you get when wakeup_bdflush is called.  The
second is what you get when update calls bdflush(1, 0).  Now notice
that almost all of the update runs say they wrote out zero buffers,
and that there can be lengthy pauses between its printing `bdflush()
activated...' and `sleeping again.'
What's going on?  bonnie generates huge numbers of dirty buffers very
fast.  Those buffers have to age 30 seconds, because of flushtime,
before update will write it out.  But we run out of memory before
that, so bdflush has to write out a few thousand buffers all in one
go.  Disk activity is bursty, latency sucks.
>In this your patch you have not tried to return to give a sense to
>bh->flushtime. And now you'll also flush all dirty buffers every interval.
Yes.  Because of the above phenomenon, I've decided that flushtime
should be discarded entirely.  Instead, do you see all the code
regarding interval tuning?  The idea is to have bdflush spontaneously
wake up more or less often depending on how many buffers there are.
It has a `goal', which is to write out bdf_prm.ndirty buffers every
bdf_prm.interval seconds.  To achieve that, the interval between
spontaneous wakeups is slewed between 1 second and 1 minute depending
on how many buffers were available to write in the previous run.  
You can't do that with userspace update, I should point out.
Experimentally speaking, this works - sort of.  Here are some bonnie
numbers:

We've gained quite a bit on input and `rewrite', but output is worse.

Yup, this fixes it.
Incidentally, in 2.2.8, do you have any idea why bdflush would be
forcibly awakened many times a second when reading?  There are no
dirty buffers for it to flush, so this does no good at all.
