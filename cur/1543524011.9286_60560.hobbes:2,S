There are false alarms caused by the "checkhelp" script not recognising
config items which have white space after the config variable.  These help
entries are handled by "config" and "menuconfig".
The only example of this in 2.3.40 is CONFIG_QNX4FS_FS, but here is a
patch to "checkhelp.pl" to catch this.
