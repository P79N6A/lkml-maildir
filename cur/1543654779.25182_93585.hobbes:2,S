Is anyone aware if any significant parts of the Linux kernel have 
been "pair-programmed?" Not necessarily the whole XP definition, but 
has anyone actually made a point to sit down with someone else and 
design a solution to add a feature or fix a bug? I'm doing a paper on 
the benefits of using pair programming in operating systems work. Any 
other thoughts or questions?
