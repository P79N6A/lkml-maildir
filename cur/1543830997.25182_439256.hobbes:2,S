Andrea is proud of getting a patent for the server part [1], so I doubt 
he would be happy with no longer having the client part defaulting to Y...
It might sound a bit strange that although Alan Cox and Linus Torvalds 
even wrote an open letter to the President of the European Parliament
calling "Software patents are also the utmost threat to the development 
of Linux and other free software products" [2]...
One bonus point for people arguing in favor of software patents - even 
Linux actively supports patented services.
