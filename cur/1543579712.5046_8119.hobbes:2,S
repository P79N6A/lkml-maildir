{Sorry... This time I actually attached the .config}
2.4.0 Kernel problem...
Alpha version only..
This seems to be purely a source problem...
attached is my .config, and here is the problem:
when using the attached .config and running a 'make dep ; make boot' I get
the following:
{previous stuff is all normal}
make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/math-emu'
make[2]: Nothing to be done for `all_targets'.

arch/alpha/kernel/kernel.o(.text+0xbb78): undefined reference to `isa_device_interrupt'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
If I change the cpu type to 'generic' instead of 'rawhide' then it works..
No problems... I would really like to optimize it though....
Help please.
