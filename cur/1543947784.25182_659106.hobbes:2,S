Actually, it's just the comment that still had the old name.. Fixed it.
-Wall reports one unused static:
drivers/char/xilinx_hwicap/xilinx_hwicap.c:240: warning:
'hwicap_command_capture' defined but not used
I'd intended to leave this in, but I'm thinking it can be done by
userspace code using this driver, so I took it out too.
In verifying this, I discovered that I had inserted a variable names
'register', which doesn't work...  Fixed that too.

Fixed.

It's not clear to me how to get 'correct' behavior in these functions if
the interrupt happens.  For instance in probe/setup, if the mutex_lock
is interrupted, it doesn't appear that there is anything to do other
than return an error code that no device is present?  I think this was
suggested by Jiri...
