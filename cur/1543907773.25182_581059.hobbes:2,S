Ok.  I think I know the feeling.

I'm confused where you are referring to but I will try answer
this.
__sysfs_get_dentry always returns a dentry or NULL if it can't
find the dentry.
I have quoted my final version of sysfs_get_dentry below for discussion.

This is the only location where could return NULL the early check
if this operation is possible.

Here we depend on the fact that sysfs_root is pointed to
by sb->s_root so we know it will always have a dentry.
