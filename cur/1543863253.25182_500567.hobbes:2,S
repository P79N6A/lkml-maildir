OK, how about this (please especially check the non SIL part):
SATA Hotplug from the User Side
- For SIL3114 and SIL3124 you don't have to run any commands at all. It
should notice when you yank the cable, or plug in a new device. All you
have to do is to stop using the devices before unplugging, e.g. unmount
partitions on the disk or remove the disk from a dm setup). One can
validate which disks are attached using ``scsiadd -p''. Note that the
device name may change from e.g. /dev/sdd to /dev/sde on a
remove/reinsert cycle (this can be fixed by using udev-provided
persistent names). Also note that it is perfectly normal to see messages
like this in dmesg:
<removing /dev/sdd>

However if you happen to see messages like
scsi 3:0:0:0: rejecting I/O to dead device
scsi 4:0:0:0: rejecting I/O to dead device
scsi 5:0:0:0: rejecting I/O to dead device
you did not stop using the devices before unplugging (check that you
unmounted all partitions, removed the disk from a raid array, dmsetup,
cryptsetup).  If you have no pending IO to the device, there won't be
'rejects IO to dead device' messages.
- For other chipsets one in addition to stop using the device before
unplugging has to call scsiadd -r to fully remove it, e.g. in the
following example the disk on scsi host 3 channel 0 id 0 lun 0 will be
removed, then on reinserting a disk call scsiadd -s :
# scsiadd -p
