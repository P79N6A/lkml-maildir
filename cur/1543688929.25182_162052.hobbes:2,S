Argh, I had hoped the driver was BugFree (tm)!
Could you try adding some debug printk's to b44_tx and b44_start_xmit
say something like:
in b44_tx()
     for (cons = bp->tx_cons; cons != cur; cons = NEXT_TX(cons)) {
                struct ring_info *rp = &bp->tx_buffers[cons];
                struct sk_buff *skb = rp->skb;
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "b44_tx cons: %d cur: %d skb: %p\n",cons,cur,skb);
and in b44_start_xmit something like:
        bp->tx_ring[entry].addr = cpu_to_le32((u32) mapping+bp->dma_offset);
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG "b44_start_xmit ctrl: %x addr: %p entry: %d skb: %p",bp->tx_ring[entry].ctrl,bp->tx_ring[entry].addr,entry,skb);
(that should hopefully be enough to see what's happening)
Also setting B44_FLAG_BUGGY_TXPTR and B44_FLAG_REORDER_BUG in
b44_get_invariants() might be worth a shot. I'm not sure where those 
flags came from, my A7V8X works fine without them and bcm4400 doesn't have
that stuff either.
