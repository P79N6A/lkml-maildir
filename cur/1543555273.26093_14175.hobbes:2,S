But:
 1) 2.2 with your latest patches also falls over, even with the DMA timeout
	workaround enabled.
 2) This happens even when the offending IBM-DTLA drive is the master
	on the primary HPT366 controller, and nothing else is connected.

Strange. If it sometimes fails during the partition detection, then I'd 
expect it to also fail in stress testing. Can you try repeatedly doing 
BLKRRPART on it {instead of,as well as} parallel 'hdparm -t'?
If it falls over at udma3, perhaps we should blacklist it all the way down 
to udma2?
