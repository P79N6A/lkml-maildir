What would the exact semantics of such a callback be?
Since for proper interaction with release agents we need the subsystem
to notify the framework when a subsystem object becomes releasable
(currently as part of css_put()), what would a can_destroy() callback
let you do that you couldn't do just by taking an extra css refcount
to prevent destruction and releasing that refcount to allow
destruction?
