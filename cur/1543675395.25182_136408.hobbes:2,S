Well if it helps at all I can vouch for the brokeness on the
Proliant ML530.  Granted this is not with a 2.4.21-rc kernel
but a RedHat kernel 2.4.20-13.9smp.  Luckily I don't use IDE
drives in this system but it did force me to do a network install
since the CDROM is now unusable.  Here is the error out of dmesg:
SvrWks CSB5: IDE controller at PCI slot 00:0f.1
SvrWks CSB5: chipset revision 147
SvrWks CSB5: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later

SvrWks CSB5: simplex device: DMA forced

hda: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: set_drive_speed_status: error=0x04
If any futher info is needed give me a yell.
