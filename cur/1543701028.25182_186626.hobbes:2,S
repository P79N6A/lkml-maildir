Hi,
 i have a problem with the final release of kernel 2.6.0.
 After a few minutes running and having a little traffic
 on my harddisk, i get the following errors in my messages
 log:
 kernel: hdc: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady\
 SeekComplete Error }
 kernel: hdc: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
 I get a few of these messages and then my machine freezes.
 Nothing works anymore. The only thing i can do is switching off the
 machine or pressing the reset switch...
 Since i installed my machine with a
 2.4.20-gentoo-r6 kernel SMP (i686), the 2.4.20 runs
 without any problems!
 Now i have the two kernels installed. The 2.4.20 from above and the
 2.6.0 (gentoo development-sources).
 - This error occurs with both 2 IDE disks in my machine.
 - "Use multi-mode by default" is enabled in both kernels.
 - A "fsck.ext3 -f" on my root partition (hdc3) had no errors.
 - A drive fitness test from IBM (hitachi) didnt report any errors.
 - Distribution is gentoo 1.4
 Thanks a lot for hints...
