Yes, I'd support that.   It's a sad thing to do, but there
is no point in misleading people in this way.  Remy already
has an entry in ./CREDITS for ext2.

Do you have time to dust that patch off?  Shit happens, and the
filesystems should be robust in the presence of software and
hardware failures.  In this case the filesystem has reached
a point where it *knows* that it is about to do the wrong
thing, it emits a warning and then it just goes ahead and does it!
