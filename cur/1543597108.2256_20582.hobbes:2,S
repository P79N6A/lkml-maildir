If 2.2 manages to service high order allocations better than 2.4, I'd
say it must be due to dumb luck more than anything else.  If you keep
most of your ram allocated (both 2.2 and 2.4 do), and don't do active
defragmentation (neither does), it's a roll of the dice whether you
have a contiguous chunk of ram to dole out or not.
wrt GFP_ATOMIC failing when memory is available, that doesn't happen
unless they are high order allocations.  If you mean caches when you
say 'available', cache pages are not necessarily reclaimable at all,
much less instantly as would be required to service atomic allocations.
