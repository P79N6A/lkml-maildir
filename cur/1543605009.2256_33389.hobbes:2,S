Well, I thought spin_unlock_irq() is supposed to enable all maskable
interrupts
by setting IF flag in the EFLAGS register which gets cleared by
local_irq_save().
I understand that spin_unlock_irq does not restore all the flags. But it
atleast sets the IF flag which enables the interrupt. I believe that this
is atleast true in case of intel x86 arch. We have not made our sources
open-source yet. So I cannot give out the sources. Sorry.
Thanks and regards,

well interrupts are still disabled...
Could you give an URL to the source of your driver so that I and others can
see what you really are trying to do ?
