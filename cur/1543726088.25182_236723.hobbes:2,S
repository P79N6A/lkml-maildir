Does your userspace process need to send/receive network packets
in order to perform a write-out?  If so, how can you make sure your
incoming packets aren't thrown away in out-of-memory situations?
(Outgoing packets can use PF_MEMALLOC memory I guess, but incoming
ones aren't associated to any process yet ...)
