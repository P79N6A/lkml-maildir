Sorry for the late reply, I don't have internet connection at home yet.
I tested things a little more and the situation is getting better.
First the riser card is a dual slot one , with a chip on it so I assumed
it is active. It has jumpers to set the device number of the upper slot
and the devices in the two slots have to share the IRQ. This is it
here :
www.tranquilpc.co.uk/support/Files/TPC014/Tranquil%20Riser.pdf
Second : I found out that tvtime and mplayer cannot deal with the
pvr-150 card as a normal analogue card. mplayer can deal with it using
the pvr:// syntax. Also using ivtv-tune and mplayer /dev/video0 works.
So the error tvtime was giving was probably because it uses v4l1 ioctls
which are not supported by ivtv or something, just a wild guess.
Mythtv works fine when choosing MPEG2 card.
Third : The bug lies in the situation where the PVR-150 card is in the
upper slot and the DVB card is in the lower slot, in which case the DVB
card does not work. That was the dmesg output I posted earlier.
Fourth : here's cat /proc/interrupts in the current working situation
with the PVR-150 card in the lower slot and the DVB card in the upper
slot.

As you can see the two cards are sharing the IRQ properly.
Thanks and sorry for replying late.
