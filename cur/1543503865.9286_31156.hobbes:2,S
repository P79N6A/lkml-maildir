Lets say I want to put a full duplex speakerphone facility on my desktop. I
need a small echo cancellor for the line, and a large acoustic one. I need to
keep the pipeline through the machine down to a a couple of 8kHz samples. If I
make the delay much greater I won't properly comply with Telco regulations, and
the line echo problem will just get worse. Cancelling the echoes and
continuously estimating the echoes takes a lot of CPU power, and even on a
500MHz machine the acoustic cancellor will only be a compromise one. This is
certainly a genuinely useful real world example of low delay audio processing.
The only way I have managed to reliably solve this kind of problem on a
dedicated DSP chip is by putting the echo cancellors inside the interrupt
service routines, and letting the chip spend almost all its time in interrupt
service. If you want really low delay audio I think you will always have to use
that type of strategy.
Real time OS's don't help much if you want _really_ low latency. I spent years
developing low delay DSP, and was never able to use an OS of any kind. The
delay through a good quality flanger (or for that matter, almost any audio
effect) for the unmanipulated component of the sound should be just a couple of
samples. Anything greater will alter the effect when the sound in the room is a
combination of the processed and unprocessed paths. You only get such low
delays by very tailored solutions.
Audio effects on general purpose computers will always be a compromise. How
large a compromise would you like, Sir?
