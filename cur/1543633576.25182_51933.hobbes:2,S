For the most part, I figure that most application of Linux, ATM, is in
the server space anyway, where 2+ processors are a must.
Also, with 4 procs and HT as Matt mentioned HT below, it will *look*
like 8.(hell, might as well be at this point the way HT seems to work.)
So, the default, as it has been in the past, is for SMP to be Y. It's a
small step to turn it off, but even if you don't, *usually* it doesn't
cause UP boxes much problems.
