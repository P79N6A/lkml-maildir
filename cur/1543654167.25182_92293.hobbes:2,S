Subject: Clock is suddently ticking too fast !  [Kernel 2.4.19-pre10-ac2, Intel]

Hi,
I have encountered a problem on two of my servers (HP LH4, 2* Intel PIII) where suddently the clock starts crawling forward at 1.3 times the wall clock time. If I type "sleep 10" it only takes 7 seconds to complete...
The machine is running NTP, but NTP rapidly gives up, showing huge offsets and saying it lost sync.
This happens after some weeks of uptime, one host is running 2.4.17-5mdksmp (Mandrake) and the other 2.4.19-pre10-ac2.
I had a look and found that I think I receive too many clock interrupts. I took a log from an external machine like this:
[remotehost]$ ssh fastticker cat /proc/interrupts; sleep 10; ssh fastticker cat /proc/interrupts
And I have:

1398
I got 1398 timer interrupts during the approximate 10 seconds !
Is this a known problem of the kernel (or the hardware) ? Anything I can do ?
