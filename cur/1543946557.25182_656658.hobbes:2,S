What's the best way to constantly follow this tree?  I had cloned it a
while ago, but now if I 'git pull' it wants to merge things, which isn't
right.
I'm guessing that this is constantly being rebased?  Against what,
Linus's tree?  So we should be able to clone Linus's tree, and then pull
in -next?
Or am I totally missing something here?

I like seeing these, to know that things are at least still working.  I
imagine you could script them, or just send them to the linux-next list
if there are no problems, but lkml should probably be notified of any
issues, right?
