Pavel,
	I might be lost here but... How is the firmware loaded when using the
ipw2100-1.0.0/patches Kernel patch?
That patch normally works fine. It might not be the way you kernel
developers would like it, but maybe that could work the same way?

Currently, when we install the driver, it associates to any open network on
boot. This is good, cause we don't want to be typing the commands all the
time just to associate. It works this way now and is pretty nice.

So, to scan a network, I would have to do ifconfig eth1 up ; iwlist eth1
scan?
When moving from modes with the firmwares, would I have to do ifconfig eth1
up ; iwconfig eth1 mode monitor? or would the firmware be loaded with
iwconfig? Does it have that function?
I'm not sure, but I guess that you guys should use the same method that the
source/patches uses?
