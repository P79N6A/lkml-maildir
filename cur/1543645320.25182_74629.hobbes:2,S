Subject: Kernel panic/exception dump support in 2.5?

It would really be nice if I could capture kernel exceptions/and oopsies
on a file, or over a network connection. Redirecting console=lp0 to
printer doesnt really let me paste dumps to LKML =)
Any solutions? Will we have a way to properly dump kernel failures
(exceptions/oopies) somewhere?
