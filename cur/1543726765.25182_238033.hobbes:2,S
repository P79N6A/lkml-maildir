I have posted  the diff at

This is against kernel linux-rh-2.4.20-31.9 which can be found in the 
OpenSSI CVS as srpms/linux-rh-2.4.20-31.9.tar.bz2
$cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.openssi.org:/cvsroot/ssic-linux login
$cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.openssi.org:/cvsroot/sic-linux co -r 
OPENSSI-RH  srpms/linux-rh-2.4.20-31.9.tar.bz2
This patch include the IPVS, KDB and OpenSSI changes
For 2.6 we are planning to group the changes into small patches that is 
  easy to review.
All the other sources can be found as tar.gz at ( 
http://www.openssi.org/contrib/debian/openssidebs/sources/
 )or better by 
doing apt-get source package on a debian system :)
