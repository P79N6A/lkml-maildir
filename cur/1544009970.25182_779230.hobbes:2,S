Is there any way to debug a kernel that shuts down without leaving any
sign of crash, shutdown demand or anything else?
I am absolutely sure it's not a power issue, as I am running
multi-boot and it's never shutting down on my other OSes, plus, with a
newer kernel everything works like a charm - even with the flag
'noreboot'. I would seriously love to find the root of this problem,
but I'm feeling slightly hand-tied on it, been seeking for hints and
trying different configurations for about 2 weeks...
Thanks in advance.
