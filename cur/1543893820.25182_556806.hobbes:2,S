Hi,
I have a laptop Toshiba M45-S355 (with Intel Pentium M Processor 750 - 
1.86GHz) and trip points show me hi-temperature (that is unsupported by 
this processor):
$ uname -a
Linux mandachuva 2.6.21.1 #1 PREEMPT Sun May 20 22:28:53 BRT 2007 i686 
GNU/Linux
$ cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/TZCL/trip_points
critical (S5):           105 C
MAX temperature suported by this processor is 100°C (I see this in Intel 
specifications), so I think that is not very good idea allow 
temperatures higher than 100°C.
$ cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/info
processor id:            0
acpi id:                 0
bus mastering control:   yes
power management:        yes
throttling control:      yes
limit interface:         yes
Best regards,
