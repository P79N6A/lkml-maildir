I see. It looks like dma_map_single() is an inline call to
pci_map_single() which is a function call that can then
look at the device and tell what IOMMU function to call.

The USB code won't work in my case because the USB system is
the one doing the memory allocation and IOMMU setup so it
can remember the kernel virtual address or physical pages used
to create the mapping.
In my case, the infiniband (SRP) code is doing the mapping and
only passing the dma_addr_t to the device driver at which point
I have no way to convert it back to a kernel virtual address.
I need to either change the IB device API to include mapping functions
or intercept the dma_* functions so I can save the inputs.
