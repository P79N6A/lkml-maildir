Hi Manfred,
	I wrote a test module and found that CR2 remains same across the 
prefetch. The module source I used is as below. Note that I had
to used "my_prefetch" because the original prefetch (in asm/processor.h) 
has been disabled in my tree to do nothing.
inline void my_prefetch(const void *x)
{
        alternative_input(ASM_NOP4,
                          "prefetchnta (%1)",
                          X86_FEATURE_XMM,
                          "r" (x));
}
int array[10];
static int __init dummy_init_module(void)
{
        unsigned long address;
        int i=0;
        int x;
        /* get the address */
        __asm__("movl %%cr2,%0":"=r" (address));
        printk ("CR2 before prefetch is %x \n", address);
        for (i=0; i<10; ++i)
                my_prefetch(array+i);
        for (i=0; i<10; ++i)
                x = *(array+i);
        /* get the address */
        __asm__("movl %%cr2,%0":"=r" (address));
        printk ("CR2 after prefetch is %x \n", address);
        return 0;
}
static void __exit dummy_cleanup_module(void)
{
}
module_init(dummy_init_module);
module_exit(dummy_cleanup_module);
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
Output of the above printk is :
CR2 before prefetch is 40017000
CR2 after prefetch is 40017000
