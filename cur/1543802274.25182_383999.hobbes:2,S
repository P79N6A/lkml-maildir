I really don't like this - if the MMC card is not locked, we set a
password on it.  If it's locked, we unlock it.
That's a potential race condition if you're trying to unlock a card
and the card is changed beneath you while you slept waiting for
memory - you end up setting that password on the new card.
It's far better to have separate "unlock this card" and "set a
password on this card" commands rather than trying to combine the
two operations.
Also, removing and re-registering a card is an offence.  These
things are ref-counted, and mmc_remove_card() will drop the last
reference - so the memory associated with it will be freed.  Then
you re-register it.  Whoops.
If you merely want to try to attach a driver, use device_attach()
instead.
Also, what if you have multiple MMC cards?  I have a board here
with two MMC slots.  I'd rather not have it try to set the same
password on both devices.
