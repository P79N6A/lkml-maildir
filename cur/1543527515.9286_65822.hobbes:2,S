Doing a down() for a semaphore in an interrupt is definitely not right.
A down_trylock() is quite legitimate so the code shouldnt corrupt the 
irq state for that one - I agree. That assumes down_trylock is irq safe
[ie semops are irq safe] which is another matter altogether.
Calling down in an IRQ is clearly a no-no
