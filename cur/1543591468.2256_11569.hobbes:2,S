Perhaps your hearing has gone more than a bit selective.  Please, allow
me to be the first to get through:
I think CML2 looks very interesting, and while it's not quite primetime yet,
it's definitely a movement in the right direction.  I'd even go sofar as to 
say I think CML2 is a GOOD THING.
Or perhaps you have a more selective definition of developer?
