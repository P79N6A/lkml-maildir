Subject: [BK PATCH] PCI changes for 2.5.69
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here's some PCI changesets against the latest 2.5.69 tree.  They include
Matt Domsch's dynamic PCI id patch for sysfs, which has been gone over
a few times on lkml in the recent past, and everyone now agrees with it.
It also includes the start of the work to add proper locking to the PCI
devices and the PCI device and bus lists.  After years of trying to
foist that task off on unsuspecting people (who later run screaming from
it), it looks like I'm finally going to have to do the work myself :)
Please pull from:

thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
