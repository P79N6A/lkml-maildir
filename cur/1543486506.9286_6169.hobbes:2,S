	Kernels 2.2.0 and 2.2.1
	I just sent a post describing similar problems. I 
have two machines with an ordinary CD and a burner. They both
use IDE scsi, and ripping or playing from the CD's can cause
unkillable processes or kernel crashes.  I can't seem to predict
when it will happen.  If something hangs, any process started
subsequently that tries to use the scsi device will hang forever too.
     Can I send the output of an strace or something ?
	You asked for chipsets:
	One is a Tekram P5T30-B4E with Intel 82430 TX chipset
	The other is a GCT board that says Intel i430TX PCIset
	Maybe I'll take the burner to school where I have a 
	Super7 board, would that provide useful data ?
