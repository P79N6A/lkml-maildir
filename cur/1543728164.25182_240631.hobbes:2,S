OK, with CONFIG_M586TSC, I am getting a lot of lockups.  A few happened
during normal desktop use, and it locks up hard when starting jackd. 
Could this have anything to do with the ALSA drivers (which I am
compiling seperately from ALSA cvs) detecting my build system as i686? 
I have read that the C3 is more like a 486 (with MMX & 3DNow) than a
686.
