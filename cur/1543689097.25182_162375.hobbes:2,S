I was waiting for Ben's « new patch later today », but I finally gave a
try to this one

The result is a panic at different place when resuming from suspend to
disk. Hand written partial debugging info:
EIP is at swsusp_arch_suspend
eax: 07200720 ebx: 07200720 ecx: c1700000 edx=esi=edi=ebp=0 esp=df793fac
Process swapper 
Call trace:
	swsusp_restore
	pm_resume
	do_initcalls
	init_workqueues
	init
	init
	kernel_thread_helper
Code: 8a 04 02 88 04 1a 0f 20 d8 0f 22 d8 a1 18 70 37 c0 8d 50 01
Panic: attempted to kill init !
Complete (?) information on my computer and kernel logs at 
http://perso.nerim.net/~tudia/bug-reports
By the way, how comes the computer suspends when echoing 4 to
/proc/acpi/sleep, and nothing happens when echoing disk to
/sys/power/state ? Aren't those two things supposed to be equivalent ?
