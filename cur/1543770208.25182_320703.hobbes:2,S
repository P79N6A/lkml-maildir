Since you say the problem started with 2.6.8, perhaps the easiest
thing to do is look at the
kernel you say worked and its config and then just diff it vs 2.6.8.
I took a second look at your original message, and since it's an irq
timeout, it could just be that your drive is slow to answer a command
and then is confused by the error recovery code.  Having two identical
laptops makes this easy.  If your other laptop has the same problem,
then it's software (or buggy hardware that the software hasn't figured
out how to work around) if it doesn't, then it's hardware and there
are a couple of things that can be tweaked to see if it fixes things.
