Well I spent a lot of time making the x86-64 timing code work
well on a variety of machines; working around a wide variety
of hardware and platform bugs. I obviously don't agree on your description
of its maintenance state.

I told him my objections privately earlier. Basically i would
like to see an actually debuggable step-by-step change, not a rip everything 
out.
If that isn't possible it needs very careful review which just hasn't
happened yet. But I'm not convinced even step by step is not possible
here.
I thought it was clear that rip everything out is rarely a good idea
in Linux land?  That's really not something I should need to harp on 
repeatedly.
