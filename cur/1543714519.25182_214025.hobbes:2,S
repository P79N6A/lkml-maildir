I like file vma merging, but I am puzzled why we (you) bothered 
to implement anon vma merging before and not file vma merging,
if the file vma merging is so much more important.  I suppose
it's something you learnt later, or the apps evolved.

Indeed.  If anonmm does live on, I would want to add the file
vma merging; but when things (mpol, prio_tree, i_shared locking)
have settled down rather than now - we've lived without it for
some years, can live without it for a few weeks more.
