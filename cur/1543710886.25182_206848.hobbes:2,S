Hi
I am trying to incorporate the functionality of MLDv1 into a daemon. This
would be in addition to the functionality already supported by the kernel
IPv6 stack.
I am opening a raw socket with proto IPPROTO_ICMPV6 in my daemon process.
When I am sending an MLDv1 report from the host, the Router is able to
receive the report. But, I am not able to receive it over the socket.
I have checked the kernel code and found that the kernel is sending reports
only if the group address being reported is added to the device multicast
list. Since I won't know the group address in advance, I can't add it to
the device multicast list.
Is there any other way to get the MLDv1 reports to my daemon. Any solution
to this problem would be very helpful to me.
Thanks & regards
Madhavi.
