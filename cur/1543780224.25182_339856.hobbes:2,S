This patch in particular is still quite controversial.  I know at least 
Andi has objections (quite valid) to the way PAE/non-PAE was dissected, 
and I would definitely like to address these concerns.  Although I have 
no objection to you committing it to the mm tree right now, please be 
advised that Chris Wright and I will have to converge quite a bit on 
this patch, and will likely be doing a substantial amount of rework here 
to work out Xen compatibilty issues as well as general cleanliness.  If 
it is more convenient for you to live without that churn, by all means 
feel free to, and we can update the patch once everyone is happy.
