Yeah, it's yet another reason to get better instrumentation in -rt for
this purpose and why it's important to only log things in the slow
path so that the front end of the rtmutex doesn't see instrumentation
artifacts in the measurement. If I get a chance tonight, I'll extend
lockdep/lockstat for this purpose if peterz doesn't beat me to it. I
won't have access to the test harness to replicate this though.
