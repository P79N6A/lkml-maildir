That's a nice little box killer you have there.
With mem=4G, running bigmm -i 5 -t 2 -c 1024:
2.4.19: Ran for a few minutes, got slower and slower and
eventually stopped.  kupdate had taken 30 seconds CPU and
all CPUs were spinning in shrink_cache().  Had to reset.
2.4.20-pre8-ac1: Ran for a minute, froze up for a couple of
minutes then recovered and remained comfortable.
2.5.44-mm5: had a few 0.5-second stalls in vmstat output, no
other problems.
It's probably the list search failure, but I can't say for sure
at this time.
