No. I already had it in 2.6.17.6.

fsck at boot turns up

nothing more

No, not exactly the same. I attach three log files. If you diff them,
there will be about 30% of the lines different.
One thing I have to note is that the second Oops appears about 10
seconds after the first one.

That indeed turns up something. The debug messages indicate that java
wants to lock something and gets stuck. Note that the messages until
"slab corruption" are printed first, and the others about a minute or
two later.
And I still can ping and do everything until the slab corruption occurs.
(Thus the other messages some minute later)

Didn't try this yet, but will.
I put the logs in a tar.bz2 because I didn't want to flood the list with
a 200k message.
