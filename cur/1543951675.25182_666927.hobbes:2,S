I don't know if there is a standard behavior under
these conditions so it is hard to argue it should
be handled a particular way other than leaving the
device in a consistent and recoverable state.
I doubt there would be support for making such changes.
Making that decision in the kernel and
having an application depend on that non-portable
behavior does not make sense.
Given that a n_tty receive overflow is not possible in
the current kernel (though data can still be lost elsewhere),
I doubt even my patch merits inclusion.
