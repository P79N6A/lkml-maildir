The only reason bio_endio() was called from ordered_bio_endio() was to
get the same side effect (bio update) as real io completions, which
should be reversed by flush_dry_bio_endio() to re-finish it later.
This was done this way under the assumption that somebody might depend
on bio updates after partial bio completion.
Now that it's guaranteed that there's no partial bio completion, none
of the dancing is needed.  Setting BIO_UPTODATE can be removed too.
Nice clean up.  Thanks.
