Yes, I am positive.  I wrote the code.  Look at the old Intel RNG driver 
code, before it grew AMD and VIA support, and became hw_random.

lkml.  Read the archives.

Hardware RNGs -have- failed in the past.  And if you are going to credit 
entropy to the data -- a very big deal -- it damn well better be random 
data.  Otherwise failures cascade through the system.

Debian does.
It's under-use is mainly because nobody has an RNG.

"big drawback" == 99% of users right now.
