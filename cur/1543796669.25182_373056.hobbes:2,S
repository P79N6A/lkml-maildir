http://git.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=e3c3374fbf7efe9487edc53cd10436ed641983aa
Remember that the only distinction between EXPORT_SYMBOL() and
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() is that the latter is a technological measure to
prevent abuse. The use of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() cannot actually impose any
additional restrictions over and above what the GPL requires of
EXPORT_SYMBOL() -- because any additional restrictions would themselves
violate the GPL.
Thus, the only point in the above-linked patch is to remove a technical
measure which prevents abuse. I feel very strongly that it should be
reverted.
