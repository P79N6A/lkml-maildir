Hi,
I'm trying to write a small syslogd that has no need of a separate
klogd. So I can use select, I'm attempting to read from /proc/kmsg
instead of using the syslog syscall. However, it seems very unreliable -
I don't see quite a few of the messages I should do. I'm using a
2.4.18-rmk7 kernel.
Is /proc/kmsg inherently unreliable for what I'm doing or am I doing
something wrong?
Cheers,
John
