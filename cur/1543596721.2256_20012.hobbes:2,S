for whatever reason, i did not even notice this.  i guess because
evolution itself exited, for some reason (normally if a single component
dies, say mail, it just puts a dialog up saying `mail component died').
i think there may be problems with determining what the parent app is,
or if there is a parent app. killing the PPID may not always be the
answer (but in many cases, like what you gave, is a very good answer).

i think i recall hearing about this, and the reply was something to the
effect of `its known but not wanted'.

i forgot to give any stats from my incident. i couldnt access the
console (the machine was almost locked, the mouse barely moved), so i
dont have any hard numbers.
from my gnome applets <g> i see load was approaching 10, memory was (or
was close to) 100%, and swap was growing close to 100%.
this is kernel 2.4.6-ac2, x86, with 256MB memory, 768MB swap.
after the incident memory was done to the bare load with only 30MB of
cache and swap was only at about 20MB use.
i restarted X but not the system, and all is well.
