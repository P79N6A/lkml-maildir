Well, the "hard" part about a crypted filesystem is how do you get the
key into the system. If it's on disk, the bad guys can find it, if you
require the operator to enter it, the operator needs to be present at
a reboot.
But "swap space" is different: It is completely acceptable if the
kernel grabs a random key from the entropy pool on the first swap.
