Define "wrong"....
Supposing it had actually crashed a couple of milliseconds earlier,
when none of the blocks had been written.  Is that any more wrong? or
less? 
When ever a machine crashes, it is wrong.  Whenever a machine crashes
you lose data.   A little more or a little bit less data being "lost"
in neither here nor there.  The only thing that it really makes sense
to worry about is consistency.  RAID5 provides all the consistency it
can, and leaves the rest up to higher layers.

No, and definitely not at the cost of delaying any writes or
complicating the code at all.
