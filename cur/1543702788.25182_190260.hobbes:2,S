           Summary: tmpfs readdir does not update dir access time
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: fs_other@kernel-bugs.osdl.org
         Submitter: mark@borgerding.net
Distribution: various
Hardware Environment: i386 (Athlons & various intel 32bit)
Software Environment: kernel 2.4.18 to 2.6.0 (at least)
Problem Description:  access times of tmpfs dirs do not get updated on readdir
Impact: This can cause empty dirs to get tmpwatch'd too early, b/c atime never
changes even though the dir is in use.
Steps to reproduce:
    cd /dev/shm
    mkdir mydir
    ls -u --full-time mydir
    ls mydir; sleep 1
    ls -u --full-time mydir
  Access time should be changed by 2nd ls.
FIX: add update_atime call to dcache_readdir function in fs/libfs.c

+       update_atime(dentry->d_inode);
        return 0;
 }
Note that other fs use dcache_readdir as well. Hopefully none rely on this
(broken?) behavior.  I found direct or indirect use of dcache_readdir ,
simple_dir_operations, or simple_fill_super in various places.  I was not
familiar enough with most fs to evaluate the impact.
