The extended attribute mechanism for XFS includes an API which
ought to fit the bill for this. I'm pretty
sure it's included in what we're (SGI) putting out for XFS.
Those who have access to Irix systems can look at the man pages for:
	attr(1), attrinit(1),
	attr_get(2), attr_getf(2)
	attr_list(2), attr_listf(2)
	attr_multi(2), attr_multif(2)
	attr_remove(2), attr_removef(2),
	attr_set(2), attr_setf(2)
I'll prod the XFS folks to encourage them to make more documentation
available.
