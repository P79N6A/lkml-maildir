"v2" perhaps? From a math pov, the extra dot implies v0.2.

I would suggest listing only struct lines that are actually required, i.e. the
compiler would barf without them.

I leave it to you whether going with the above or
enum {
   HIF_MUTEX = 0,
   HIF_PROMOTE,
   HIF_DEMOTE,
   HIF_GREEDY,
   ...
};
If these values need to stay the same, for example to maintain on-disk
compatibility, I prefer the former, though.

What four quotas can there be? Use the MAXQUOTAS macro if feasible.

Is this an on-disk structure or why is there a __pad field?
