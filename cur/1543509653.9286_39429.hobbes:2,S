Bullshit. 
myserverd opens its server port myserverIP:myport next it just waits
for the connections to come in. All of them have localIP/localport the
same, but remoteIP/remoteport are 6 bytes of connection identification.
If you're handling lots of outgoing connections (unlikely), you might
run into trouble.  Suppose we want ephemeral (sp?) ports, the kernel
might say "Sorry, none found" when you've used all of them. This is
incorrect (but nobody has run into it yet). After one round around the
port space searching for an unused port, the kernel should just
allocate a port that's already used. Then you can connect to any
IP/port, except the one that the existing connection is already
connected to. If the kernel knows the destination IP/port at that
time, it should try to avoid that situation. Otherwise, it should just
hope for the best.
