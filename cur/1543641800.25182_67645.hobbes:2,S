That's what the code did, unless I misunderstood it.
Anyway if you want to give a different fsuid to a filesystem function,
you either pass credentials as a parameter (that means that you change
all the functions in the call chain to do that) or you modify a
structure present or referenced from the task_struct (or you disable
preemption and use a per-cpu variable, but this would be a very bad idea
here).
Furthermore if no one except the current task can access/modify the task
credentials the "gratuitous changing of privileges" is only seen by the
VFS function you call, so it is fine (it may not be conceptually
elegant, but that should not be preferred over being fast and minimally
intrusive).
