It dies with:
[    0.131000] SMP alternatives: switching to UP code
lguest: bad stack page 0xc057a000
I added a dump_stack on the Host, which gives:

[124320.091069]  =======================
Now, the "SMP alternatives: switching to UP code" message made me wonder
if it had anything to do with the alternatives, so I tried disabling
the switch by passing noreplace_smp...
... But the message was displayes anyway (and the smp_locks section
freed), because the check my patch adds is not made.
With the patch, I can boot lguest with an SMP kernel if I pass
noreplace_smp.

I can't figure what the use case is, debugging set aside,
but there are places (eg xen, __cpu_die) in the kernel calling
alternatives_smp_switch(1) at runtime.  Passing smp-alt-once will prevent
the switch.
