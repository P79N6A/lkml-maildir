Hi Joseph,
You don't mention what USB device you are using with your compact flash.
I don't have any problems with a "SanDisk Imagemate, SDDR-31" USB
CF reader: works flawlessly.
I'm using a up-to-date Red Hat 7.3 system with Red Hat kernel 2.4.18-10.
Maybe the driver(s) for your USB and/or cardreader are buggy.
	greetings,
	Rob van Nieuwkerk
PS: before chosing the SDDR-31 I did some extensive web-research on the
    USB/CF readers available with Linux.  I chose the SDDR-31 (which
    can be a bit hard to get nowadays) because it seemed the device
    with the least (Linux) problems.
