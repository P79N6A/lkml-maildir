thanks. I've added them to the -rt tree and it should be in the next 
release (2.6.20-rt2).
(a couple of small suggestions for future submissions: if you send them 
as attachments (which is fine to me), please name patches canonically, 
i.e. "arm-no-hz.patch", not "arm-no-hz-patch.txt" and include the patch 
description in the patch file too - or just send it all as plaintext. 
Plus please Cc: everyone who's involved with the patch(es) so that they 
can see feedback too - in this case that would be Daniel Walker, Kevin 
Hilman and David Brownell.)

that patch has problems because it breaks non-OMAP platforms. There was 
a brief discussion about it but no updated patch AFAICS.
