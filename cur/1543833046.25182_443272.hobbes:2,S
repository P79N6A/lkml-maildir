Of course thats not the only one.
If nothing changes in userspace, it still has to be build with every new
kernel no matter how many other kernel changes were just added.
I remember it took some time to build klibc-0.123.
And if klibc really depends on kernel headers, and I do git-bisect on a
slower box, thats a waste of time. That really asks for an external
binary. Or CONFIG_KLIBC=n, if thats not convincing.
