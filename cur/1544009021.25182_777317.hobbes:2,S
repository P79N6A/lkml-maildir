i've just implemented it. Running an (infinite-loop) hello.c with 6 counters on a 
CPU that has only two counters now gives the expected:
 counter[0 cycles              ]:           3368245084 , delta: 842019470 events
 counter[1 instructions        ]:           1384678210 , delta: 346108294 events
 counter[2 cache-refs          ]:                  659 , delta: 150 events
 counter[3 cache-misses        ]:                    0 
 counter[4 branch-instructions ]:            266919398 , delta: 66731508 events
 counter[5 branch-misses       ]:                 1201 , delta: 315 events
This will be in -v2.
