Subject: 2.4.0-test2-ac2: kernel BUG at buffer.c:1459

I've seen this reported twice before, all with -test2-ac2.
It happens after umount'ing an (msdos formated?) floppy
2 people already mailed an oops, run thru ksymoops, so I won't do it,
unless you really want me to.
I also had kdb running, and wrote that down ...
Is this an -test2-ac2 specific bug? Is it fixed yet?
Kurt
