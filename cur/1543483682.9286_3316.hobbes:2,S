Making this change (clobber) to "io_apic.c" makes it work correctly on
both of my SuperMicro P6DNF's.
        /*
         * Careful with this one. We do not use 'true' logical
         * delivery, as we set local APICs to LDR == 0. But
         * 0xff logical destination is special (broadcast).
         * Any other combination will cause problems.
         */
#if 0
        entry.dest.logical.logical_dest = 0xff;
#else
        entry.dest.logical.logical_dest = 0x00;
#endif
if (entry.dest.logical.logical_dest = 0xff;)
{
cat interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:      13748         27          XT-PIC  timer
  1:        101        128    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
}
if (entry.dest.logical.logical_dest = 0x00;)
{
cat interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:      73540          0          XT-PIC  timer
  1:       1996       1868    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
}
These boards have a broken apic-timer.
I get random 'spurious APIC interrupt, ayiee, should never happen.'
when the timer on the second CPU is anything but 0.  Note history
is repeated everytime CPU1's XT-PIC timer is not "zero".
I will agree that this is a hammer method to success; however, why should
we every have a XT-PIC interrupt register on anything other than CPU0?

You just need a bigger hammer, or learn how to swing the one you have better.
