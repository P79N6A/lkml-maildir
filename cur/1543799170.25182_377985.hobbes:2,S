I'd be much more worried about this than about your patch that just 
modifies one driver.
Basically, this would make _all_ sound drivers initialize before the other 
drivers, and that just makes me suspect you'll have a lot of new bugs that 
get uncovered by the fact that the configuration changed radically.
So I'd much rather either fix one single sound driver (that can't mess up 
anything else), or fix the sound _core_ to just initialize in the right 
place. Moving _all_ sound drivers earlier sounds risky as hell, for no 
good reason.
