Subject: [PATCH 2.6.25-rc2 5/9] Kconfig: Improve init/Kconfig help descriptions - IKCONFIG etc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/21/473

Rewrite the help descriptions for clarity, accuracy and consistency.
Kernel config options affected:
  - IKCONFIG
  - IKCONFIG_PROC
  - LOG_BUF_SHIFT
  - SYSFS_DEPRECATED
  - RELAY
  - BLK_DEV_INITRD
