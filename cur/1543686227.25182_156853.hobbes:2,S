The idea is that this kind of process WANTS to be a CPU hog.  If it were 
not for the fact that the I/O is not immediately available, it would 
never want to sleep.  The only thing it ever blocks on is the read, and 
this is involuntary.  It doesn't use a non blocking call because it 
can't continue without the data.
The questions is:  Does this matter for the issue of interactivity?
