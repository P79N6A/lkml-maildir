It would be so much nicer if the patch actually was "below" - that is
"inline in the email as opposed to as an attachment". Having to first
save an attachment and then cut'n'paste from it is a pain.
Anyway, a few comments below :
+#define DEBUG(n, x, args...) do { if (pc_debug >= (n)) 			    \
line longer than 80 chars. Please adhere to CodingStyle and keep lines
<80 chars.
There's more than one occourance of this.
+static inline int cmx_waitForBulkOutReady(reader_dev_t *dev)
Why TheStudlyCaps ?  Please keep function names lowercase. There are
more instances of this, only pointing out one.
+        register int i;
+	register int iobase = dev->link.io.BasePort1;
Please use only tabs for indentation (line 1 of the above is indented
with spaces).
+	for (i=0; i < POLL_LOOP_COUNT; i++) {
for (i = 0; i < POLL_LOOP_COUNT; i++) {
+        if (rc != 1)
Again spaces used for indentation, please fix all that up to use tabs.
+	unsigned long ulBytesToRead;
lowercase prefered also for variables.
+	for (i=0; i<5; i++) {
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
+			DEBUG(5,"cmx_waitForBulkInReady rc=%.2x\n",rc);
Space after ","s please : DEBUG(5, "cmx_waitForBulkInReady rc=%.2x\n", rc);
+	ulMin = (count < (ulBytesToRead+5))?count:(ulBytesToRead+5);
needs spaces : 
ulMin = (count < (ulBytesToRead + 5)) ? count : (ulBytesToRead + 5);
+	reader_dev_t *dev=(reader_dev_t *)filp->private_data;
reader_dev_t *dev = (reader_dev_t *)filp->private_data;
+static int cmx_open (struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)
get rid of the space before the opening paren : 
static int cmx_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)
+	for (rc = pcmcia_get_first_tuple(handle, &tuple);
+	     rc == CS_SUCCESS;
+	     rc = pcmcia_get_next_tuple(handle, &tuple)) {
...
+		if (parse.cftable_entry.io.nwin) {
+			link->io.BasePort1 = parse.cftable_entry.io.win[0].base;
+			link->io.NumPorts1 = parse.cftable_entry.io.win[0].len;
+			link->io.Attributes1 = IO_DATA_PATH_WIDTH_AUTO;
+			if(!(parse.cftable_entry.io.flags & CISTPL_IO_8BIT))
+				link->io.Attributes1 = IO_DATA_PATH_WIDTH_16;
...
+		}
+	}
How about not having to indent so deep by rewriting that as
	for (rc = pcmcia_get_first_tuple(handle, &tuple);
	     rc == CS_SUCCESS;
	     rc = pcmcia_get_next_tuple(handle, &tuple)) {
...
		if (!parse.cftable_entry.io.nwin)
			continue;
		link->io.BasePort1 = parse.cftable_entry.io.win[0].base;
		link->io.NumPorts1 = parse.cftable_entry.io.win[0].len;
		link->io.Attributes1 = IO_DATA_PATH_WIDTH_AUTO;
		if(!(parse.cftable_entry.io.flags & CISTPL_IO_8BIT))
			link->io.Attributes1 = IO_DATA_PATH_WIDTH_16;
...
	}
+        link->conf.IntType = 00000002;
more spaces used for indentation. Not going to point out any more of these.
+	cmx_poll_timer.function = &cmx_do_poll;
shouldn't this be 
	 cmx_poll_timer.function = cmx_do_poll;
???
+	int i;
+	DEBUG(3, "-> reader_detach(link=%p\n", link);
please have a blank line between variable declarations and other statements.
