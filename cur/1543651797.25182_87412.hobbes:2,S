A nit, I suppose, but the v850 is not a `platform' in the conventional
sense of the term, it's a completely new architecture.  uCLinux, OTOH,
is not an architecture, but a tweak to various parts of the kernel to
remove the requirement for an MMU (yeah I know what you meant, but
others may not).
Thanks,
