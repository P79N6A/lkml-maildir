Hello All!
	[ please CC me - I'm not subscribed to the list. ]
	This question was in my mind for couple of years.
	But after all I decided to ask it. (Better later - than never ;-))
	Little prehistory: I had on my old home PC two hard drives - hda &
hdc.
		hda was big and new, while hdc was old, small and sure it
contained 
		a lot of old useful stuff. So I decided to upgrade my very
valuable hdc.
		And sure, as simple novice in hdd upgrades, I've made smth
like:
			# dd if=/dev/hdc of=/root/hdc_img
		And right after upgrade - I got small rebate in exchange for
my old hdd - 
		I understood my problem.
	I do not know the way to mount partition table!
	it's possible with loop device to mount partition - but how to mount
whole 
	hdd (with its own partition table) to have access to single
partition inside???
	Digging into the kernel (it was 2.2 times) brought no answer:
major+minor was 
	used to identify the partition and I saw no way I can give this
beast 
	a file - not real hard drive.
	So that's the question:
	Is it possible to mount a 'hard drive' - just like any other fs -
and see 
	inside of this fs partitions as regular files?
PS As for my hdc - very quickly I came back to the shop and reversed my
/upgrade/... ;-)))
