I would second that. There are several other filesystems already merged or
under discussion that are superficially similar - fuse, coda, and even nfs!
However, v9fs is the only one that is (all of)
1) suitable for synthetic filesystems (resources),
   as well as 'normal' filesystems
2) equally good for local and remote filesystems
3) OS/machine independent "on-the-wire"
4) (network) transport independent
5) has a significant history of deployment
If there are few Linux applications using v9fs as yet (but there is plan9ports),
then one must admit that there is something of a chicken-and-eggs
situation involved!
