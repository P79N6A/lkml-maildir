Only for vma policy, right?  show_numa_maps() isn't a performance path,
and shared policies are already reference counted--just not unref'd!

Well, it was a 32-way parallel build [-j32] on a 16-cpu system--my usual
build method.  But, I'm guessing that all of the build tools are single
threaded and all using default policy, so no reference counting is
needed.
I'm taking a look at your 'pft' program, and I'll try that.
I do have some ideas for enhancements to memtoy to test vma policies in
a multi-threaded task.  I have the basic multi-threading infrastructure
that binds threads to cpus, allocates node local stacks, thread state
structs, ... in my mmtrace tool that I can probably hack for use in
memtoy to provoke cacheline bouncing of the mem policy.  But, if pft
does the trick, I won't rush the memtoy enhancments...
Meanwhile, we do have a mem policy ref counting bug in the mainline.
Later,
Lee
