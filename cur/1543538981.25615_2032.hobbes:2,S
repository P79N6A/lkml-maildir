Wouldn't ya know it?  Mere *minutes* after I release CML2 0.7.0, Linus 
ships 2.4.0-test4.  No rest for the wicked.
Release 0.7.1: Fri Jul 14 17:35:30 EDT 2000
	* Rulebase is synchronized with 2.4.0-test4.
	* Fix for the documented Tk race problem in 0.7.0.
Pthpthpthpthppt!  <--  Wet raspberry.  Wonder how that translates to Swedish?
Get off yer butts, configuration-file dudes.  Let's *not* make this
transition another devfs-style long-drawn-out epic...
See y'all in Monterey...
