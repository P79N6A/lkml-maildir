For low-level driver it shouldn't really matter whether sectors to be
written are the commit block for a transaction or the previous log blocks
and in the current implementation it does matter.

If "log blocks" is a separate request from "commit block",
we can just do: log blocks, flush, commit block, flush cycle.
