It's the standard BSD license. I would really be suprised if that's the
first BSD code in the kernel. The issue should be handled like in the other
case, although I'm not interested in wheter the license text stays or is
purged.
A simple solution for implementation selection would be to add "depends on
!X86 || X86_64" to aes generic. MODULE_ALIAS will take care of the rest.
I have to state that I'm not interested in developing a more complicated
framework for automatic cipher selection. I've always been opposing
configuration wizard and install scripts with
magic-logic-that-will-configure-software-entirely-on-its-own-and-totally-wrong
gimmicks. My aim is to provide a good/working aes-i586 patch.
