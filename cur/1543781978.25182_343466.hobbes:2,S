What about just using jiffies, then?
Really, sched_clock() is very broken for this (I know you're
not arguing against that).
It can go backwards when called twice from the same CPU, and the
number returned by one CPU need have no correlation with that
returned by another.
However, I understand you probably just want something quick and
dirty for 2.6.13 and would be happy just if it isn't more broken
than before ;)
