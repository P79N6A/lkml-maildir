i've intentionally not added these - we should only add function groups
which are truly used, especially when it's a legacy interface anyway.
I believe the prefered driver model for ISA stuff should be symmetric to
the PCI model: you can ioremap() ISA space addresses just fine, ioremap()
just returns a pointer into directly mapped kernel area, iounmap() works
just fine as well, and you can read[bwl]()/write[bwl]()/etc. the resulting
pointer just like in the PCI case. So i think the isa_() functions should
only be used for truly trivial or legacy code.
