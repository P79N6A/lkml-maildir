Hello Martin,
I am glad to have received your e-mail.  I was just thinking about
you.  For a quick update, as I am attempting to get demos out the
door for LWE:
Bryce has convinced me to setup a daily diary on advantgo.
   
http://www.advogato.org/person/France
which I plan on updating this afternoon.  In short for me on alpha this
week:
Monday: I worked on the usb-uhci.c driver which has a few
               32 bitisms.  I will not have time to submit a tested
               patch until after LWE. The problem appears to be
                   unsigned int io_addr = pci_resource_start()
               and possibly
                   unsigned int io_size = pci_resource_len()
              putting a 64bit address into a 32bit slot just does not
              work very well. :-)  Even after changes the 'int' to 'long',
              the USB device worked extremely well, but upon inserting or
              removing a USB device, the SCSI controller on my system
              hangs for about 30 secs while it resets due to receiving
              an invalid instruction.  I suspect that there is corruption
              of some kind on the PCI bus, but I do not have time this 
             week to track this down.
Tuesday: My Binutils patch was accepted for adding
               -mev67, -mev68, -m21264a and -m21264b
               Chatted with Bryce on several Alpha related issues.
Wed: Meet with Jay, Jeff, John and Harry in Nashua.
         Jeff has 2.5.x (x=29 IIRC) working with smp and non smp systems.
         after some testing the patches should make it to the kernel soon.
         I pushed out updates for RH7.2 (Alpha) for  gcc, util-linux, glibc
         and openssl.
         I worked on the RSS patches for the autobuild system.
Thur: I chatted (e-mail) with Peter Petrakis today.  He would like me to upgrade
         the system which hosts alphanews.net and linuxalpha.org to use RH7.2
         I hope to have time on Friday (today, yikes!), before I leave for LWE.
As for gcc 3.1 in the kernel, most Alpha kernel hackers use egcs or 2.95. 
Personally I tend to use 2.95 for my kernels.
I have UNH students that build several complete toolchains everyday
for alpha including 2.95.x, 3.0.x, 3.1.x and gcc-head.  By complete tool
chain I mean binutils, gcc, gdb, glibc and all the support programs.
   
http://handhelds.org/projects/toolchain/autobuild/build-results.php3
I am certain that they would like to chat with you in great detail about
toolchain issues related to the Alpha architecture.
I agree that communications in regard to Alpha could and should be better.
We should probably setup a wiki or webpage to help keep track of  Alpha
issues or maybe just use one of the existing alpha mailing lists or I could
setup something on alpha.crl.dec.com next week.
I hope this helps.
Best Regards,
--George
