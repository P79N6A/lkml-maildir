There were some similar reports involving that "status write for unknown
orb".  I haven't found a way to reproduce it; I noticed it only once in
the logs here so far.

As long as it ends in "reconnected to...", failure messages like this
can typically be ignored.  It cannot be predicted which failures are
transient and which aren't, hence all are logged.

Among else I too have an Intel Mac mini (running x86-64 Linux though)
and a OXFW911 enclosure with a NTFS formatted disk in it; I'll swap the
disk and try stress tests with a native filesystem.

Alas this kind of bug is harder to debug remotely, and the root FS isn't
exactly ideal for respective tests...  I'll try to remember to Cc you on
potentially related patches though.
