The total length $(VERSION).$(PATCHLEVEL).$(SUBLEVEL)$(EXTRAVERSION)
must not exceed 64 characters.  Break that limit and you get garbage in
uname -r.

kbuild 2.5 enforces the limit, the existing kernel build code does not.
I sent a patch to Linus four times back in the 2.4.15 days, he
completely ignored it.  Linus does not care about kernel build
problems.
I will dig out the patch and send it to Marcelo.
