Having read the whole thread, I came up with a few ideas.
The following patches in -pre3 could perhaps have to do something with
your problems:
  o (resend) collected semaphore fixes and semtimedop
  o Fix potential IO hangs and increase interactiveness during heavy IO
  o fix false sharing of mm info
  o fix up semops and return, allow timedop
  o mremap VM_LOCKED move_vma
  o remove io_apic_modify - this doesnt work on some APICs
  o small setup-pci cleanups
Since your hangs are not even traceable with SysRq, please try to boot
with nmi_watchdog=1 and if that doesn't work (dmesg will complain)
nmi_watchdog=2. About 15 seconds after the hang your box should print a
backtrace.
As a last resort you could mount the fs from UML.
I suggest you try the nmi_watchdog thing first.
