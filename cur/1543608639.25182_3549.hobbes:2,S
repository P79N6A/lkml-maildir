This would be great. This source _does_ need cleanup. Since I saw taht 
everyone did copy all the functions I just did the same :-)

I sent the patch to linux-kernel, but do you think I have to send it 
personnally to Alan & Linus ?

Damn ! You're right :-). The first entry is needed, because the i810 
chipset uses the secondary device (at least this is what is written in 
the code. see the 'agp_find_supported_device' routine. I remember this 
is needed for on-board chips. Does that make any sense :-) ? ), but the 
i820 related one is useless (afaik).

The reason for rewriting this function is that, according to the Intel specs, 
the APSIZE register is 8bits long (at least for the i820)! The generic function reads 
16 bits, so who knows what will be in the neighbouting register ? I guess it was 
working by accident, but if you have an argument for sticking to the generic 'fetch_size'
I am all ready to replace my part by the generic one :-)
I have to leave by now, I'll check my e-mail tonight, but it is
likely that I won't make any patch before tomorrow :-(
Best regards.
