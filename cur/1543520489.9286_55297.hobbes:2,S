Hi,
The symbol reference I have removed, the isdn module was not linked
properly to the hisax. This has been solved.
Now, I have Red Hat 6.1, kernel 2.2.20 which has a autodetection feature.
Although the card gets detected, the hisax module is not getting loaded
for it. 
with modprobe type=11 protocol=2, for the Eicon Diva 2.0 pro pci,
it gives an error that 
Diva : NO pci bus found.
what could be the reason??.
bye,
prakash
