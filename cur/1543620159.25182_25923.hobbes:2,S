   The new sym53c8xx driver (sym2), and that one only if is actually is
   configured for DAC-mode (SYM_CONF_DMA_ADDRESSING_MODE > 0).
It is not using the DMA apis correctly then, it should be using
dma_addr_t which may or may not be 64-bits on a given platform.
The sym2 driver needs to be fixed.
Franks a lot,
