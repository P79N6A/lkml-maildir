I also got a first broken disk, the second one (which I currently have)
does work.... only problem: BIOS says correctly that it is a UDMA disk
but Linux doesn't.... using hdparm to turn on some features kills the
kernel... My two quantums (ST8+SE6) do work as UDMA33 disks.
system: Abit-AX5 + p200mmx + Quantum ST8Gb SE6Gb + Teac Changer +...
The IDE controlller onboard is from the intel TX chipset.
(for a dmesg see 
http://unfix.org/projects/changer/dmesg_229
 | dmesg_234 )
Does it need a util to switch it from UDMA66 to 33 ???
Or is it simply not supported enough by Linux???
Greets,
 Jeroen
