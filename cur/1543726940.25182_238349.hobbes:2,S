My gripe with this is that the interface still is relative-to-HZ time.
I'm convinced that driver(writers) are better off with an absolute time
interface, eg add_timeout_ms(), add_timeout_us() etc.
(which btw also give a hint about the accuracy required, so that the
kernel can group milisecond delays together even when they got scheduled
at different usecs, once we get timers that accurate)
