I hate to ask such a stupid question, but has something "major" changed in 
the IDE code between 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 that would cause it not to probe for 
devices?  I've got 2.6.1 running great.  This morning when I used my 2.6.1 
config file for 2.6.2 (doing a make oldconfig), everything compiles great.  
Unfortunately when I boot 2.6.2, it doesn't find any IDE devices.  With 
2.6.1, the IDE code would probe and find my ZIP disk, and 2 CDROMs, now 
with 2.6.2 I get nothing.  Loading ide-cd and/or id-floppy don't do 
anything either.  Enclosed is my config file.  I've also tried adding and 
removing different boot params such as:
hdc=cdrom hdd=cdrom
or
hdc=ide-cd hdd=ide-cd
but still nothing.  Here is  are my lilo conf file entries for 2.6.1 and 
2.6.2:
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.1
   label=2.6.1
   initrd=/boot/initrd-2.6.1.img
   read-only
   append="root=LABEL=/"
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.2
   label=2.6.2
   initrd=/boot/initrd-2.6.2.img
   read-only
   append="root=LABEL=/"
Thanks in advance,
Torin
