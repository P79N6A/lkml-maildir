i have been running 4.0.2 on my smp system using the 2.4.1 kernel.  the
one thing is, i was using the xfree out of precision insite's cvs with
the g400 binary-only hal lib dri module loaded.  every-so-often,
especially when closing windows or switching virtual desktops, the
kernel would crash.  luckily, i'm also running kdb on a serial console,
so i am able to check things out and keep a log.  unfortunately, when
btp all the processes, i found no text.lock, which is as far as i know
how to "debug" a kernel crash.
of course, this could very well be something wrong with the binary-only
module from matrox, so i'm seeing if the same problem presents itself
with the original mga.o loaded (which also disables hardware dri).
