For the kernel stuff there is a project to put documentation about functions
and what they do inline into the kernel. Its slow progress. Trying to do 
anything formal and structured isnt going to be productive until the 
documentation is much much more complete
For syscalls Andries Brouwer maintains a man page collection (and writes many
of them). He takes submissions.
