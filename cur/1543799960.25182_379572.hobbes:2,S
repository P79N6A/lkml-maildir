No, you're absolutely right. It's idiomatic for things like strcpy,
where the type is known, but not for memcpy.
However, it just so happens that GCC will happily treat math on void
pointers as if they were char pointers. So this in fact will
compile without errors:
void cpy(void *a, void *b, int count)
{
        while (count--)
                copybyte(a++, b++);
}
Linus thinks this is a feature but I don't, so I'm not recommending
it. In fact, given the whole point of this function is to copy dwords,
not bytes, this GCCism fails us for type-safety.
At any rate, the dereference on s above _is_ a compile error - it's void
type.
