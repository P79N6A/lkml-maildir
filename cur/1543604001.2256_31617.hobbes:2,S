I already did that. I fixed MAX_DMA_ADDRESS and the
kernel now reports:
zone(0): 1024 pages
zone(1): 7168 pages	/* this should be 4096 */
...
Which is not true as we have a gap between 4 - 16MB
phys memory. I also played with add_memory_region(),
but the kernel still think we have 32MB ram instead
of 20MB as is the case.
Also it lock solid in __get_free_pages in mem_init()
Probably this is related to zone(1) wrong assumption
right?
best,
Petko
