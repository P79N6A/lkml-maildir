I have now finally once seen it happen while I was watching, again
on 2.6.21-rc5. The X display was idle and blanked because I hadn't
touched the keyboard and mouse in a while (it seems to happen only
in that state) but I had "top" running in an ssh session from another
machine so I could see what the machine was doing.
Just before the KDE crash, an "online_update" process appeared. The
KDE processes vanished from "top" more or less together with that
process. Before, the system had been idle except for the screensaver.
"online_update" was most probably started by SuSE's "susewatcher"
applet, and according to its log found some new updates, so perhaps
it did try to emit a sound as Rafael suspects. (The machine doesn't
have speakers connected, so I can't tell.)

Could be the same. The report is not detailed enough to say.
Oliver provokes his crash with amarok which would fit in with
the sound hypothesis.

Looks promising. Building -rc5-git12 now. Will test that until
-rc6 arrives.
Thanks,

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice.
In practice, there is.
