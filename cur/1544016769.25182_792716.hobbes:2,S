Our pci_enable_msix() doesn't do that.  It will always do A---.

And that exactly is why I'm not sure it's correct.
Namely, if only the first entry is configured, the device is only able to use
one vector, represented by this entry, for any purpose.  Now, for instance, for
PCIE_CAPABILITIES_REG, there are two possibilities:
(1) the value in the register always points to the _valid_ entry in the MSI-X
    table and that would be the first one,
(2) the value in the register may point to an _invalid_ entry (1 - 3).
You seem to assume that (2) is the case, but I'm not sure (that should follow
from the PCI Express spec, but it clearly doesn't, at least I couldn't find
any pointer in the spec).  IMO it wouldn't make sense, because the port
wouldn't have been able to generate interrupts for this service if only one
vector had been configured.
Still, even though (2) is the case, but both PCIE_CAPABILITIES_REG and
PCI_ERR_ROOT_STATUS just happen to point to the same entry, which very well may
be possible, the second pci_enable_msix() in your patch will fail.
In any case, I think we should
(a) get the number of the port's MSI-X table entries _first_, without enabling
    MSI-X,
(b) allocate as many MSI-X vectors as indicated by this number, even though
    some of them may not be used,
(c) use PCIE_CAPABILITIES_REG and PCI_ERR_ROOT_STATUS to check
    which vector has been allocated to which service.
Thanks,
