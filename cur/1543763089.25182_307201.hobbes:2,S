I test the overhead of sending the fork information to a user space
application. The merge of the data is done later and it has nothing to
do with the fork connector...

  Accounting is another problem and, as you said previously, summarizing
and analyzing the data is done later. 
  I'm sorry but I really don't understand why you're speaking about
accounting when I present results about fork connector. I agree that
ELSA is using the fork connector but the fork connector has nothing to
do with accounting.
