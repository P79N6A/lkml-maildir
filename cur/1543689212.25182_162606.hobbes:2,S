the quota fix was included in the next (test) release
so default quota will work again ...
the Quota Hash Abstraction is neither a (big) performance
gain nor a feature bonus for the end user ... it is more
an enhancement to the code itself, allowing to have more
than one quota hash for arbitrary purposes ...
I doubt, that this code will ever make it into mainline
without another 'good' reason to use it, but maybe the
--bind mount quota stuff would be such a reason, if the 
interest for such things will eventually grow ...
HTH,
