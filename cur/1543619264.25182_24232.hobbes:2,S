Hi folks,
I think there is a little Problem with Kernel 2.4.17-pre4 - pre7
When the machine in up for longer than 2 days and is under higher load, the processes will killed, with some syslog-messages: 
kernel: Out of memory: Killed process <pid>
I don't know what the Problem is, and all machines where it is, are SMP-Machines on i386.
Two times, I traced the problem and the system reported full memory.
But, the processes and the Utilities are the same like before updating the kernel,
except the gcc (is now 3.0.3)
Can you solve this?
