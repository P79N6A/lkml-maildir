It is not healthy. It is basicaly misdesigned piece of hardware called
UHCI. It simply does DMA all the time :-(.

It sounds like an acceptable plan. I see no real disadvantage in
"suspend with parameter X means quiesce", and I think we'd get smaller
patch that way, but if you go through -mm like this, we can do it.
