I didn't say I would use it. But I bet there are people who would find
a use for it. 
For example getting some kernel konfiguration data from some strange
database or LDAP or whatever. Or having some simple scripts for
autotuning depending on load&co which are changeable by the
non-kernel-hacker.
Most of this stuff can be done in userspace and should be. But I am
always amazed by the strange uses perl (and linux) get into.
Java with all its problems could be used for this too.
