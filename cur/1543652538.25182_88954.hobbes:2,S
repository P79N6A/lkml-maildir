Okay, tihs just needs the introduction of something that can produce
a number out of ->sysdata (or whatever):
        sprintf(dev->slot_name, "%02x:%02x.%d", dev->bus->number, PCI_SLOT(dev->devfn), PCI_FUNC(dev->devfn));
This wants to be something like:
        sprintf(dev->slot_name, "%02x:%02x:%02x.%d", dev->bus->segment, dev->bus->number, PCI_SLOT(dev->devfn), PCI_FUNC(dev->devfn));
On the way in 5 minutes or thereabouts. I'm restarting from just before
the NUMA changes.
