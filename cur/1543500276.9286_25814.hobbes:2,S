Hi,
  i´ve started a hopefully feasible linux implementation of a BSD system call.
I want to ask the experts for their comment and hand over the code if the
approach is feasible.
Here is the an application, a code extract from the login program:
#if 0
      /*
       * Please don't add code to chown /dev/vcs* to the user logging in -
       * it's a potential security hole.  I wouldn't like the previous user
       * to hold the file descriptor open and watch my screen.  We don't
       * have the *BSD revoke() system call yet, and vhangup() only works
       * for tty devices (which vcs* is not).  --marekm
       */
      chown (vcsn, pwd->pw_uid, (gr ? gr->gr_gid : pwd->pw_gid));
      chown (vcsan, pwd->pw_uid, (gr ? gr->gr_gid : pwd->pw_gid));
      chmod (vcsn, TTY_MODE);
      chmod (vcsan, TTY_MODE);
#endif
The same may also apply to audio devices(recording from a microphone?) and
others.
I've found revoke manual pages for freebsd and openbsd and also looked at the
BSD kernel code. This is the manual page from openbsd:

REVOKE(2)                  UNIX Programmer's Manual                  REVOKE(2)
NAME
     revoke - revoke file access
SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>
     int
     revoke(const char *path)
DESCRIPTION
     The revoke function invalidates all current open file descriptors in the
     system for the file named by path. Subsequent operations on any such de­
     scriptors fail, with the exceptions that a read() from a character device
     file which has been revoked returns a count of zero (end of file), and a
     close() call will succeed.  If the file is a special file for a device
     which is open, the device close function is called as if all open refer­
     ences to the file had been closed.
     Access to a file may be revoked only by its owner or the super user.  The
     revoke function is currently supported only for block and character spe­
     cial device files.  It is normally used to prepare a terminal device for
     a new login session, preventing any access by a previous user of the ter­
     minal.
RETURN VALUES
     A 0 value indicated that the call succeeded.  A -1 return value indicates
     an error occurred and errno is set to indicated the reason.
ERRORS
     Access to the named file is revoked unless one of the following:
     [ENOTDIR]     A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                   entire path name exceeded 1024 characters.
     [ENOENT]      The named file or a component of the path name does not ex­
                   ist.
     [EACCES]      Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                   prefix.
     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.
     [EFAULT]      path points outside the process's allocated address space.
     [EINVAL]      The named file is neither a character special or block spe­
                   cial file.
 
     [EPERM]       The caller is neither the owner of the file nor the super
                   user.
SEE ALSO
     close(2)
HISTORY
     The revoke function was introduced in 4.3BSD-Reno.
BSD Experimental                 June 4, 1993                                1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I´ve not approached it like this BSD manpage is describing it but it think it
fulfills the requirements. BTW: It is not bound to devices, so it can also
be used on regular files.
If the code here works if the processes which have opened the file are not
in kernel mode. And this is the part I want to have comments...
A possible, but not neat solution could be be to kill that processes, uh,
i hope you have better answers... ;-)
If we really can get a robust implementaion in the kernel we can optimize
it, e.g. it can finish when the usage counter is zero...
Here is the code, it just walks though the task list and closes any file,
regardless if the process is stopped in read() or running on another CPU...
