Alan,
In standards and in hardware specs, from which the meaning of
"illegal" is borrowed from (into standards), "illegal" doesn't
necessarily mean "invalid", and cannot be substituted for.
This is exactly why this particular word is used in the ASC/ASCQ
assignments.  It exposes an underlying behaviour.
For example:
> -	{0x2004, "Illegal command while in write capable state"},
> +	{0x2004, "Invalid command while in write capable state"},
Consider this: the command itself can be very perfectly "valid",
e.g. the SCB contents, format, etc., but certainly "illegal".
Similarly for the rest of this patch.
