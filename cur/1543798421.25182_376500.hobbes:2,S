Just a (luser) datapoint here: since I have computers with small cache
(Celeron Mendocino and Duron Spitfire), I am always trying to save some
bytes here (being minimalistic as much as I can) and there and I have
been compiling kernels since about 2.6.10 with -Os in my Debian systems.
I'm currently using Debian's GCC 4.0.2 and everything seems fine here
with kernel 2.6.15-rc5.
Hope a data point helps towards making this option more visible.
Regards, Rogério Brito.
