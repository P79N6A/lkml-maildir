Eh?  The file (or directory) must be labelled as a cowlinked file the
moment you make the cowlink, not when the data is modified.  It's
_breaking_ the cowlink that happens when the data (or directory
contents) are modified.

The creation of a cowlink should be atomic w.r.t. writing.
Specifically, the operation which moves the contents of a non-cowlink
inode to a newly created shared inode, and converts the original
non-cowlink inode to a cowlink inode, should be atomic.
Is there an unavoidable race condition?  I don't see one.
