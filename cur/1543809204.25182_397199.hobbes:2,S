It seems that you did missunderstand Linux:
I did send a fix for an important bug in 1997 and it was NOT integraded by
the Linux kernel people.
As long as the Linux project proves that Linux is not yet mature enough for 
being able to _really_ do what you propose, it makes no sense to waste time
on LKML.
