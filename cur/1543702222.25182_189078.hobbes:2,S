Right it is a documentation thing.  The case that causes me to pull
my hair are Itanium boards.  Typically they have 6 or 7 1MB rom chips,
for their firmware.  My goal with going down this road last was so
user space could figure out which rom chip is at which address and
how those correspond to mtd devices.
Using the existing interfaces to export this information looked like
the cleanest way to make certain that information was available until 
I ran into snags like the above.  And once I replace the BIOS I can
fix these things at the source, but...

Same here.

Agreed.  In practice it does not happen, but it is worth thinking
about.
The important thing to maintain is that nothing else grabs the
area the BIOS reserves with a dynamic resource.  So as long as
there is a resource over that area the kernel is safe, even
if I do grab it with insert_resources it does not really matter
to the rest of the kernel because someone has it.
The ROM chips actually have ID's so I can always positively identify
those, I just don't always know their count.  The worst case would be
the rom chip probe causing problems.  And that can be avoided by
simply not loading the driver so I think we are fairly safe.
In the case where I open up the decoder beyond the size it is
currently set for I can test for conflicts, from other devices.
The only reason I would not see another device at that point
is if either (a) there are ordering problems in the kernel or
(b) a SMM bios is doing truly stupid things.  The case where
there is a device there and we aren't using it is not a problem
because I am just reserving a region of the address space.
Now that I have thought about it some more I think the right
was to do with IORESOURCE_TENATIVE it instead of removing tenative
resources to just push them aside.  So in my terrible case I would
get:
fff0000-ffffffff : BIOS ROM Window
fffffff-ffffffff : reserved
And that cleans up all of the structure freeing problems.  I guess I
can do that right now with ____request_resource after I find the
conflict and confirm it has the name "reserved".  I still like the
tenative idea because then any one else who needs the same
functionality would not need to reimplement it.

That works to some extent.  But it actually a lot more dangerous because
you have to be there in person to verify everything is working fine, and to
insert the floppy.  Doing it from Linux I can update the entire an
entire cluster in a minute, and verify everything automatically.  And
it happens faster because I can load it all over the network.
