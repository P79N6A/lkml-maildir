No, I object to the concept of "platform" to disable all uevents by
default, just to work around its MODALIAS misuse. The rest of the kernel
works properly, and userspace has a unified way to handle events and
module loading.
There is absolutely no reason for "platform" to be different and break
all reasonable assumptions of module-init-tools, udev and HAL.
Thanks,
