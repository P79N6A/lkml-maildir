The userland prototypes are:
extern ssize_t sendfile (int __out_fd, int __in_fd, off_t *__offset,
                         size_t __count) __THROW;
extern ssize_t sendfile64 (int __out_fd, int __in_fd, __off64_t *__offset,
                           size_t __count) __THROW;
Thus you really cannot transfer more than 4G-1 bytes in one call on 32-bit
arches.
Actually, already any counts >= 2GB-1 might be problematic, but we are
there on the same boat as with e.g. read(2).  For read, POSIX says:
"If the value of nbyte is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is
implementation-defined."
so portable programs really shouldn't try to transfer more than that
in one go but the kernel certainly should try to handle sizes up to
SIZE_MAX-4096 or something like that.
