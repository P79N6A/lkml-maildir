That's a minor bug with the patch.
The code does this:
ide_dma_verbose::printk( ... "2048kB Cache");
eighty_ninty_three::printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: skipping word 93 validity check\n");
ide_dma_verbose::printk(", UDMA(66)"
Something in there needs to insert a '\n' before the "skipping word" message.
Since it doesn't do that right now, the KERN_DEBUG string appears as "<7>"
