I am sorry if the format of this message is not ideal but it is being sent
to both the linux-kernel mailing list, and to the author of cdrecord.
Here we go...

Up until today I have been using kernel 2.0.35 from SuSE 6.0 and using
cdrecord perfectly to write cd's to my yamaha cdrw drive.
When I boot with a kernel 2.2.1 I cannot write to the drive at all (not even
in dummy mode) due to the error:
cdrecord: Cannot allocate memory. Cannot send SCSI cmd via ioctl
This only happens with kernel 2.2.1 and if I boot back in 2.0.35SuSE it's
fine.

The command I used was:
mkisofs -J -r -v -V mooooo -o /otherdrive/mooo.image *
to make the iso image. (from /root/)
it made a 30mb image
then I used
cdrecord dev=0,3,0 -v fs=1024k -dummy speed=4 -eject mooo.image
to write the file out (from /otherdrive/)
The output from cdrecord was:

I can't think of anything else which could help.
Please e-mail me when things have been sorted. It is a pain to reboot
between kernels when I want to write CD's but there is no way of getting
my sound card (PCI PnP one) to work happily with 2.0 and at the moment
I can't write with 2.2
