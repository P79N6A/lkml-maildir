Precedence: bulk

These four items have been marked as Ready or Pending for a while and yet nothing 
has happened for the last 2 months so I'm planning to change their status in the
next status update.
Comments?  Objections?
-- Guillaume
o Ready       Add hardware sensors drivers                    (lm_sensors team)
--> Mark as Beta?  Reason: not in sync with latest kernel and problems with IBM Thinkpads
o Ready       New kernel config system: CML2                  (Eric Raymond)
--> Mark as Beta?  Reason: needs to be broken up in chunks before inclusion
o Ready       Read-Copy Update Mutual Exclusion               (Dipankar Sarma, Rusty Russell, Andrea Arcangeli, LSE 
Team)
--> Mark as Beta?  Reason: patch exists against 2.5.7, but not sure if it needs more work 
    before inclusion or there is objection from Linus?
o Pending     Finalize new device naming convention           (Linus Torvalds)
--> ???  I am not sure what is going on here -- it seems Linus is waiting for someone to step up and 
    submit a patch following the new device naming convention he vaguely outlined a while back?
