Ok, I will update documentation to reference /sys/bus/dst/devices
instead of /sys/devices

It is not a parent - it is an example for device called 'storage', if it
will be called 'testing', then path will be /sys/devices/testing or more
correct /sys/bus/dst/devices/testing :)

Here 'storage' is just a name for device called 'storage', it can be
anything else.

That's because I always used atomic operations as a reference counters
and did not tried krefs :)
They are the same actually (module tricky arches where smp_mb_* are
required), so I can replace them in the next release.

For 3-4 attributes it is faster to register them in a loop than typing
another structure :)

What is 'default attributes' and for what devices?
All my sysfs files are so much trivial, so they do not need anything
special and I do not see what is error handling you mentioned.
