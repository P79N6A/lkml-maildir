This uses double negation and is close to unreadable.
A kernel include file that defines an interface to a user space program
should be self containing (that means that all includes for all non-standard
types should be done inside these include files). Whether or not C-99 
types are used or not is less important than to use type definitions written 
in clean C so compilers other than gcc may use them.

I recommend you to install Sun Studio and to try to compile star or cdrtools
using Sun Studio by calling "make CCOM_suncc".
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/star/alpha/
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/alpha/
You may need to hand edit the file incs/<arch-dir>/{xconfig.h!rules.conf}
in order to enable the auto-disabled features.
In any case, self reading the error messages from Sun Studio helps more than
trying to discuss it.
