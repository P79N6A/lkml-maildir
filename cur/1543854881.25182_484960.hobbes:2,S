This shared memory is allocated somewhere in the upmost 128MB of physical memory that is NOT permanently mapped into the kernel ( found in swapper_pg_dir ). How can I "smp_save" map this memory into the kernel address space ?
See how copy_highpage and friends are used by copy_to/from_user. The
kmaps are a limited resource so you can only really use them to briefly
map objects in this way.
