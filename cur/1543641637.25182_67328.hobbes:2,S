Subject: [PATCH] prevent oops in xprt_lock_write, against 2.4.20

hi marcelo-
when several RPC requests want to reconnect a TCP transport socket at
once, xprt_lock_write serializes the tasks to prevent multiple socket
connects.  however, TCP connects are always done by a RPC child task that
has no request slot.  xprt_lock_write can oops if there is no request slot
allocated to the invoking RPC task.  reviewed and accepted by Trond.
i had thought the 2.5.32 patch wouldn't apply to 2.4.20, but Trond pointed
out to me that his xprt_lock_write patches snuck into 2.4.20-pre5, which i
hadn't noticed.
