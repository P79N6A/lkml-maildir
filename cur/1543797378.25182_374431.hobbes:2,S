Ingo,
We are unable to build a similar .config (PREEMPT_DESKTOP with soft and
hardirq preemption disabled) on x86-64:
In file included from include/linux/mm.h:15,
                 from kernel/printk.c:20:
include/linux/fs.h: In function `lock_super':
include/linux/fs.h:849: warning: implicit declaration of function `down'
include/linux/fs.h: In function `unlock_super':
include/linux/fs.h:855: warning: implicit declaration of function `up'
Let me know if you need the exact .config
Lee
