Not really - there are free, open source OS projects other than Linux in
fairly advanced stages technically, (I.E. they do more than just boot, and
can run real applications).
However, to take my attention away from Linux, an OS project would probably
have to be fairly revolutionary, and represent something that I honestly
believed could not ever be practically achieved with the Linux model.
The only obstacle that I can see to creating something better than the Linux
kernel, is that nobody is doing it yet.
John.
