Does this imply that the option:
  CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y
doesn't work on x86? Or works poorly? I'm not sure what changes you're
proposing, but if they will make this more robust I'll certainly use them!
SMP lockups are the bane of my existance, although
19-pre8-ac4+preempt+iowait has yet to take that route.
