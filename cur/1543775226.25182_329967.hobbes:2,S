See "make help" : 
$ make help | grep "dir/"
  dir/            - Build all files in dir and below
  dir/file.[ois]  - Build specified target only
So, as you can see, typing
  make drivers/net/
for example, will build everything in the drivers/net/ dir (and
subdirs), and if you type
  make drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx.o
It will build just that one object file...
