Subject: [PATCH] generic_osync_inode() with OSYNC_INODE only passed (Re: [PATCH 1/2] miss-sync changes on attributes)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

generic_osync_inode() seems to do over-writing, if OSYNC_INODE only passed.
According comments of generic_osync_inode(), it is expected to write inode
itself only. Current implementation trys to write data page, even if
OSYNC_INODE only passed. This patch fixes it.
This patch is preparetion of other patch to fix "miss-sync changes on
attributes".
