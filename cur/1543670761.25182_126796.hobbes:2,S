Brute force merge to 2.5.68. Certain things are still being worked on
which are commanding my attention above the details of merge to current.
In order to boot, back out changes from pgcl-2.5.66 to mm/bootmem.c and
mm/page_alloc.c; proper fixups for the recent bootmem.c and page_alloc.c
changes that came from mainline are still being worked on. Some simple
asm-i386/pci.h pci_dac_dma_to_page() and pci_dac_dma_to_offset() fixes
are also pending, which are the usual substitutions.
TODO (in no particular order):
(1) merge the asm-i386/pci.h fixes
(2) fix up the bootmem stuff so current works
(3) fix up the memmap_init() stuff so current works
(4) PAGE_SIZE -align pkmap and kmap portions of fixmapspace to remove
	core dependencies on FIX_KMAP_END for aligning addresses.
(5) debug the scatter/gather kmapping calls for COW and anon pages
	to reduce internal fragmentation of pagecache
(6) find the problem with ext2 and 64KB PAGE_SIZE
(7) fix q->max_sectors < PAGE_SIZE
(8) audit the rest of drivers/

(I was fortunately able to collect these /proc/meminfo statistics
because some specific tests were scheduled on the hardware today.)
