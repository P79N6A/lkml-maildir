The IDR interface is a bit cumbersome.  Even though you called
idr_pre_get(), there's no guarantee that the memory which it preallocated
is still present when you call idr_get_new().
It's easily fixed though:

Just move the idr_pre_get() to after the down().  That way you know nobody
else will steal the preallocation.
Is the kernel likely to ever have so many bus IDs that we actually need
this patch?  Or do you specifically want first-fit-from-zero for some
reason?
