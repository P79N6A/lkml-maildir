we save object owner on the object. So if you change the container,
objects are still correctly charged to the creator and are uncharged
correctly on free.

it can be done by the same syscall or whatever which sets your
container group.
we have the same syscall for creating/setting/entering to the container.
i.e. chaning the container dynamically doesn't change the interface.

this works mostly for CPU only. And OpenVZ design allows to change CPU
resource container  dynamically.
But such a trick works poorly for memory, because:
1. threads share lots of resources.
2. complex databases can have more complicated handling than a thread per request.
  e.g. one thread servers memory pools, another one caches, some for stored procedures, some for requests etc.
BTW, exactly this difference shows the reason to have different groups for different resources.
Thanks,
Kirill
