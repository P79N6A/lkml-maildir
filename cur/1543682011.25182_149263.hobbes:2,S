Subject: 2.6: marking individual directories as synchronous?

Hi,
I'm reading through Joseph Pranevich's great document "Wonderful World of 
Linux 2.6" and I came across something that I'd love to learn more about.  
In the "Block Device Support" -> "Filesystems" section, reference is made to 
"Individual directories can now be marked as synchronous so that all changes 
(additional files, etc.) will be atomic".  I searched through the update 
info at kernelnewbies but
couldn't find any more information on this - could someone please elaborate 
on this?  What is it and how does it work?  Is there any design 
documentation for this?
Thanks!
Dan Behman...
