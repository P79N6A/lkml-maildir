Actually we do include some areas that aren't yet in the LSB spec or
fully supported by Linux (eg aio) in the LSB test suites we release -
they just aren't run by default - but it is easy to enable them.

Yes, I agree TET does have a significant learning curve, and I do end
up writing small test programs that don't include the TET stuff before
sending off bug reports.
I have however seen some advantages - It is nice when you get a test
failure the report tells you exactly which part of the specification
you're violating. Once you do understand the TET/vsxgen library calls
testcases look much simpler - and if you're aiming for complete
functionality coverage including all the tricky corner cases for
various interfaces which can require quite a bit of setup code to get
into the right situation I think you'll end up having to write helper
libraries anyway.
