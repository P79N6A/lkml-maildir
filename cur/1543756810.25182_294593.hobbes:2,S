I just want to point out that this is a problem for distributions and
for not-so-technical users.
Is there *really*  no way to know if you're on a lifebook? Can't you use
say the DMI identification mechanism to find this out ? If so, I think
integrating into the regular driver very much is the right thing to
do... it makes things JustWork(tm) for users without any need for manual
configuration (which also makes distribution makers happy).
