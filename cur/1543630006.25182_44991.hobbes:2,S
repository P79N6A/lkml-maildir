Subject: [PATCH] Fix scsi.c kmod noise
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/5/9/153

This patch fixes the scsi kmod issue that annoyed me to tears, and
confused me on several bug reports. This error crops up whenever scsi.c
is compiled in (which is fairly common in 2.4, Red Hat Linux does this
as well). Since its in scsi.c, this bug occurs on all archs, not just
sparc/sparc64 (which is where I'm working).
"kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k scsi_hostadapter, errno = 2"
I didn't see it in bk, so I sent it here.
