Subject: [PATCH] Oracle startup split_vma fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Alessandro Suardi and Zlatko Calusic independently reported that
Oracle cannot start on recent 2.5: excellent research by Zlatko
quickly pointed to vm_pgoff buglet in the new split_vma.
Patch below against 2.5.40 or 2.5.40-mm1: please apply.
