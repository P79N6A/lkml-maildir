I have no clue about VM's but I can imagine that for example the following situations have different requirements:
1-Desktop: many "small" apps, I believe exe's remain in memory and data is written to disk? Anyway I can imagine fragmentation and latency is an issue here.
2-DBMS: 1 or 2 big programs which sometimes even do their own memory management.Fragmentation and latency isn't issue here I think however moving ltos of data to and from swap is.
3-Webserver: for example apache with many childs being created under high load and killed under low load. The data is always small (in case of static pages). So a lot of small swaps? Latency is not as much as un issue but I can imagine that fragmentation can be an issue?
I think these 3 situations behave very differently, but then again it's just what I think. I can also imagine that more situations are possible but not many.
I also indictated that we have a few parameters we can optimise for like latency, fragmentation and moving a lot small chunks, or occasionally 1 big chunk.
I know from an AI perspective that optimize for 3 different parameters is difficult.
