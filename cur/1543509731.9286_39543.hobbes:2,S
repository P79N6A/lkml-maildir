Use non-blocking I/O.  Always use non-blocking I/O.  O_NONBLOCK.
Even with select(), a descriptor that's marked "available for write"
might not be by the time you try, because the buffer space might not be
available any more.
Basically, treat the result of select(), poll() or sigwaitinfo() as a
hint.  A pretty good hint, guaranteed to say "yes" at least often
enough.  In fact sometimes it's worth trying a non-blocking write even
before getting the hint, if you've acquired the urge to write to an fd
for the first time in a while.
[This also applies to reads, but I couldn't think of a good example]

Just use an array: mydata[fd].
The kernel uses an array, so you can too.

Another good reason not to add the feature.
