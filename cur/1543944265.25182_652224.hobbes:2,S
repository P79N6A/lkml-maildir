This can't be correct without a matching put in the error leg.
The difference between the two APIs is that pci_get_device returns a
pci_device with a reference taken and pci_find_device doesn't.  However,
pci_get_device does drop the reference again so as long as you never
exit the loop until it returns NULL, it is OK ... it's the exits before
pci_get_device() returns NULL that need the put.
