Well, I'm not so confident that it's the way to go.
The problem is that currently the ALSA ISA driver wants to refuse
loading (and modprobe returns an error) when no devices are found at
loading time.  On 2.2/2.4 kernels, PCI drivers also show the same
behavior, but it was changed for a good reason.
Then, shouldn't be the ISA drivers changed to follow the same style?
That is, we keep pnp_driver and platform_driver regardless probe calls
succeeded or not.  They can be, in theory, later bound/activated over
sysfs.
At least it would make the code more simpler, I guess.
