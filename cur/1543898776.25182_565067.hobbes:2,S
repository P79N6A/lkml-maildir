In theory, yes.  But it scales far worse than letting everyone
experiment/report/fix problems as they crop up.

If it was due to a config option marked experimental, then it's not a
regression.
It's a bug, and it needs looking at, but while the freezer is not
completely removed, it's not a serious problem.
So I agree with Ted, a config option (or maybe a runtime sysctl
tunable) to turn off the freezer for suspend should only have positive
effects.
