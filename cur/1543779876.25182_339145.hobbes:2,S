The fundamental purpose of a memory policy layer is to control memory 
allocation  on a system. If there no way to obtain that policy 
information and no way to control the policies then what is the purpose of 
the memory policies? Would it not be better to implement most what is 
currently in the kernel in user space since its restricted to a process 
anyways?

Because its not possible to view and control memory policies otherwise.

So your point of view is that there will be no control and monitoring of 
the memory usage and policies?
