It sounds like that would be a useful course of action.

Changing fstab will not cause / to be mounted by ext2: the kernel makes the
decision for /.  You may be able to use "rootfstype=" (I don't think I've
ever tried it).
The proper way to convert to ext2 is:
- boot with init=/bin/sh
- /sbin/tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/hda1
- /sbin/e2fsck -fy /dev/hda1
- reboot, edit /etc/fstab for the non-root filesystems.
