I don't think solution for unattended servers exist. Perhaps for someone
else OOM is acceptable solution, but not for me. If someone wants to use
it. It is fine by me, but I don't belive everybody should be forced to use
it just, say, for shake of someone who wants to run unattended servers.
In fact this reminds me as I have seen an 1'500 pages book about ....
... "Zero System Administration" :-) (yeah, NT book)
unattended severs is just a gamble, There's plenty other things
which can go wrong like hdd going bad, fan failings, new security
exploints. 
Most of the sysadmin places I have seen operated on pretty much 24x7
sysadmin basic.
