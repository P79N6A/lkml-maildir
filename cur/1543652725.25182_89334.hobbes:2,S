Subject: [Patch] Prevent crash when loading "cpqfc" with Tachyon XL2 cards (against 2.4.20-rc1-ac1)

Hi,
 please apply the appended patch to "drivers/scsi/cpqfcTSinit.c". It 
adds a call to "pci_enable_device" which prevents a hard crash when 
loading the driver on a Tachyon XL2 based HP card (IA64 platform). The 
patch is against 2.4.20-rc1-ac1, but should apply to mainline.
 In general, is someone working making the Tachyon XL2 cards really work 
with the cpqfc driver? I am very interested in that. It is really sad 
to see those 60 FC disks idle when Linux is booted on our rx5670 :-( I 
would love to help out with testing and experimenting.
 The current problems (after applying this patch are):
- unable to read WWN from NVRAM
- no GBIC found
- no link state
- no disks found
Thanks
Martin
