We could certainly remove the test for a null destructor in there and
require that compound pages have a destructor installed.
But the main reason why that code is in there is for transparently handling
direct-io into hugepage regions.  That code does perform put_page against
4k pageframes within the huge page and it does follow the pointer to the
head page.
With your patch applied get_user_pages() and bio_release_pages() will
manipulate the refcounts of the inner 4k pages rather than the head pages
and things will explode.
We could change follow_hugetlb_page() to always take a ref against the head
page and we could teach bio_release_pages() to perform appropriate pfn
masking to locate the head page, and perform similar tricks for
futexes-in-large-pages.  But with the code as-is the refcounting works
transparently.
If it's "broken" I wanna know why.
