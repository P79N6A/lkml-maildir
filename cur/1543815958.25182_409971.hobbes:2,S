i think this sounds very sane, and an OS-specific interface shim gets 
around problems such as finding CPU-specific state -- we can get at 
smp_processor_id() just the same as the rest of the kernel, for 
example. We could extend the concept of the interface shim we already 
have -- a set of OS-specific high performance shims, plus a fallback 
OS-agnostic shim.
