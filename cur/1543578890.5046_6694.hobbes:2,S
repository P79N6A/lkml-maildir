 Confirmed.

 The conclusion was to add something like common_cpu_data, which would be
independent from boot_cpu_data.

 It's not supposed.  Another struct should be added.  Boot_cpu_data is
expected to be used during an early SMP boot only.  That's the original
semantics and it should be preserved, I think.  The SMP code relies on it.

 Good spotting.

 Yep, that needs glibc or whatever introduces rdtsc to be fixed.
 Thanks for the patch -- I'll see how to fit it within my point of view.
I'm somewhat time-constrained these days, but I might be able to spend an
hour or so on coding and testing this issue tonight.
