Thanks Andrea,
after applying the patch, I repeated the experiment. Since the cat
/dev/dvd >/dev/null no longer really made any difference, I started at
the same time a dd if=/dev/hda2 of=/dev/null (a 6 GB partition) and
eight find / processes at slightly difference points in time (to
excercise the same disk blocks repeatedly). I let the whole thing run
for about 5 times longer than the original test, and while the system
still pushed a lot of programs onto swap (from an initial used memory of
190 megs, up to 80 was pushed onto swap while I kept "using" most of the
programs by clicking on buttons etc), the system remained fairly
responsive (a couple of individual apps became sluggish enough to
categorize as unresponsive, but a couple of other programs kept
responding almost as well as in a no-load condition). To top it off, I
tried to play some .ogg files with XMMS - there were breakups in the
output every 10-15 seconds, but other than that, XMMS worked fine as
well. I don't run XMMS with realtime priority, so that might have fixed
even the sound output problems.
I'd have to say I now (finally!) have a kernel which doesn't eat up all
my memory.. :) For the record, the setup now is 2.4.10 +
rml-preempt-kernel-1 + aa-vm-tweaks-2.
Cheers,
 Osma
