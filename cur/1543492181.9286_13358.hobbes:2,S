This card has worked fine for me for a while, but since upgrading to 2.2.5
the network device
in nonfunctional when I come in to work in the morning. I don't have SMP
turned on in the kernel.
I don't have the eepro100 compiled as a module. I'll rebuild it as such for
tomorrow, so I can see it un- and
re-loading it will fix it.
Here is a section out of /proc/pci:
  Bus  0, device  20, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Intel 82557 (rev 5).
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  IRQ 9.  Master Capable.
Latency=64.  Min Gnt=8.Max Lat=56.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xf3dff000 [0xf3dff008].
      I/O at 0x7c60 [0x7c61].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xf3f00000 [0xf3f00000].
here is my ifconfig:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:04:AC:36:E0:20
          inet addr:199.171.201.112  Bcast:199.171.201.255
Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:2543873 errors:23 dropped:0 overruns:7 frame:27
          TX packets:367230 errors:2400 dropped:0 overruns:1 carrier:0
          collisions:372223
Please let me know anything that I should do inorder to discover more.
     Thanks
