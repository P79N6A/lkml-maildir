Hi, 
Please reply to or cc to bwang@ee.eng.ohio-state.edu
I apologize if this is not appropriate to this list...
When I tried to install Redhat 6.2, I have the following problem.
The kernel hang at the line "PCI: probing PCI hardware" forever.
I was wondering if you have any ideas to fix it.
I tried booting Debian 2.1. Not many error messages other than
"boot failed".
My system is a dual CPU with 256M memory (Rambus ram), the motherboard
is Intel OR840 using Intel 840 chipset, on-board ethernet card, IBM IDE hard
disk, Matrox32 video card, one CD-ROM and floppy. No other add-ons.
The output of the kernel starup is as follows.
loading initrd.img
loading vmlinuz...
uncompressing linux ... ok, booting the kernel
linux version 2.2.14-5.0Boot (root@porky.devel.redhat.com)
Detected 797973243 Hz processor

Thank you very much!!!
