Subject: [PATCH 07/10] x86: add remaning bits from x86_64 to Kconfig.i386
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/3/155

A few symbols remained in Kconfig.x86_64 where the
dependencies were different or the help text was
different from the i386 one.
Modify all relevant Kconfig.i386 symbols such that
they have X86_64 dependencies for x86_64 specific items
and update the help text as appropriate.
