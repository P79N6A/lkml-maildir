2.4.23?

Ah you have a working fn-f5? good! fn-f5 will fix your display in most
cases, however, my experience is also that it can mess things up. If you
can get in 1024x768 without fn-f5 please try so, to make sure the chip is
in a clean state.
Remember to do all tests with both displays enabled. When you are in
1024x768 60 Hz, the hardware stretcher is disabled. Test if horizontal
stretching works:
fbset -xres 640
You can do this because the video timings are locked to
1024x768-60, and your refresh rate does not get a boost like with a
normal vga monitor. Because we only use 1 Crt controller, your external
monitor is locked too.
You should now have a 640x768 mode. Watch the image on the Crt display. It
should be rock stable during the mode switch the Crt should not be
detecting any mode change and the picture should not change position.
Switch back to 1024x768:
fbset -xres 1024
Now try the vertical streching:
fbset -yres 480
Check again very close what happens on your crt. It is my expectation that
one of these tests fails and the other will wok correctly.

I'll send you my register dump programs so you can compare the setting of
the Crt controller with fo example X video modes.
