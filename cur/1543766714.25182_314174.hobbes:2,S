  Do you mean that the set/clear parameters to do_mlock() are the
actual flags which are set/cleared by the caller? Also, the issue
remains that the flags are not reference counted which is a problem
if you are dealing with overlapping memory region, or even if one
region ends and another begins on the same page. Since the desire is
to be able to pin any memory that a user can malloc this is a likely
scenario.
