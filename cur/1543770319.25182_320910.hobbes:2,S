I had brought this up in the dim past in the context
of adaptive mutexes which could via heuristics decide
whether to spin/sleep.

Spin if the lock is contended and the owner is active
on a cpu under the assumption the lock owner's average
hold time is less than that of a context switch.  There
are restrictions as once a path holds an adaptive
mutex as a spin lock it cannot acquire another adaptive
mutex as a blocking lock.

Yes, I was trying to make that point in an earlier thread.
