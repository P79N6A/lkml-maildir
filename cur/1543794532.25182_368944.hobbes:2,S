Query: is the problem that a big initramfs image is being unpacked more than 
once, or is unpacking an empty initramfs image (134 bytes) causing a 
significant delay?
I'm fairly certain that back in 1990 I could unzip 134 bytes on my 33 mhz 386 
running dos in a fraction of a second.  What's the use case here?
