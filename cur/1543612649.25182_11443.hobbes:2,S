IA64 is still using the drm-4.0 code, as are the (possibly obsolete)
-ac kernels.  The drm 4.0 makefiles are a pain in the neck and I want
to get rid of them asap.  The SiS direct render is only for drm 4.1 so
now is a good time to question if 4.0 is still required.
How long do people plan to keep drm 4.0 code in their versions of the
kernel?
