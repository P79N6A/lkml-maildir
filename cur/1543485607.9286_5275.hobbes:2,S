The reason for the *2 is that in Linux skbuff headers are accounted in the
socket buffer size too. To keep BSD compatibility which doesn't account them
the size is multiplied with two. It is crude, but it works.

Why do you do that anyways? I agree that the kernel should set a bigger
minimum limit but to be honest - if you do something stupid like setting
the buffer size to zero what do you expect? 
I wouldn't see it as a serious problem.
