I have framebuffer console here, and just leave printk enabled during
system. Last messages usually tell me where to look for problem...
Plus I test suspend quite often so that regressions show up quickly.
In the early days, plain vga console on machine where bios kicks video
card to work after resume did wonders, and I had to use hardware
debugger on one machine, too.
Another common trick is to test s2disk, first. It tends to catch many
driver problems.
