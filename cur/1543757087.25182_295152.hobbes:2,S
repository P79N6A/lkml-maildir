I never disabled it.

Good. I guess that's highly chipset-specific.

I used to unload modules, shutdown network interfaces etc. until I
tried without all that stuff and it still worked. So I concluded
that stopping things before suspend was a thing only needed with
older kernels. Granted, mounted volumes on USB or IEEE1394 still
have problems because the kernel doesn't expect them to disappear
for a few moments, but that's nothing a module unload would fix.
Simply umount all external drives and use my script. Drivers which
still need to be unloaded and reloaded are buggy and have to be
fixed.
I'll prepare a web page with detailed S3/S4 suspend/resume
information for ATI graphics card owners including step-by-step
howtos for smooth suspend/resume cycles.
Kendall Bennett is working with me to get suspend/resume working
even with framebuffers. Once we have results, I'll post them here.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
