The XP processors aren't certified by AMD to work in SMP
configurations, but the XP and MP processors are identical.
I've got a Tyan Tiger w/ 2x Athlon XP 1800+ running 2.2.19, and it
works just fine.  (And compiles its kernel blindingly fast.  :-)  The
only Tyan-related problem I've heard people having is that it's quite
picky about what type of RAM it tolerates.  It must be registered ECC
RAM.
