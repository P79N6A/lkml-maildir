And that for examples is a very important and needed change.  Security
modules as loadable modules are a bad idea as you don't have a consistand
labelling state - just look at the older selinux versions with all the
precondition mess.  But it should be generalized to a new initcall level
instead of the current explicit call to the selinux routine..

Yes, sorry.

The problem is not really the indirection but the submission of the
indirection without it's users.

Unfortunately I don't decide about the linux 2.6 freeze - ask Linus.

+ moving to extended attributes instead of magic files for storing the
  labels on filesystems
+ getting the patent issue sorted out

Personally I prefer to not have infrastructure in over having broken
infrastructure.  Looks at what the devfs mess caused in 2.4 and how much
was removed or is beeing removed/rewritten again in 2.5.  Life would have
been a lot simpler if it never got in during 2.4.  Similarly I don't see the
problem why the current lsm users can't keep using patches during 2.6.
