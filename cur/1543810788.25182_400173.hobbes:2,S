Hi all
When i tried kernel 2.6.15.4, i noticed i cant boot it, i get
"warning: cannot open initial console" then it reboots. I've searched
for it and found the breakage occurs from 2.6.15.1 to 2.6.15.2
Before i start to bisect to find the culpirit, and as there were few
changes, anyone has a good guess about what broke it?
Thanks all in advance.
