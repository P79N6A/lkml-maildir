In response to some suggestions I give
more for the record on my problem of getting
ata100 transfer rates:
"hdparm /dev/hda" gives:
/dev/hda:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 3649/255/63, sectors = 58633344, start = 0
so 32 bit mode and dma are indeed on... and still 11 MB/s.
Thx for all the suggestions!
B.D.
