Interesting.
The one example I quoted above, atkbd_set2_keycode[0xb2] is in fact 0.
Perhaps your kb is doing something unusual w/ the key release events.
If the kb is, eg, |=ing w/ 0x80 rather than preceding w/ 0xf0 then
0xb2 would be the release event for 0x32.  atkbd_set2_keycode[0x32]
is 48 (KEY_B in input.h).  
So if you get unknown scancode 0xb2 from hitting the B key, that is
the cause.
Otherwise, perhaps a list of some keys and what they printk()
might help debug it.
