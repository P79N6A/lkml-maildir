Tried this on grml64 (cause I'm normaly on x86)
Results:
--
WARNING: with --dmi mcelog --ascii must run on the same machine with the
     same BIOS/memory configuration as where the machine check occurred.
HARDWARE ERROR. This is *NOT* a software problem!
Please contact your hardware vendor
CPU 0 0 data cache STATUS 0 MCGSTATUS 4

Kernel panic - not syncing: CPU context corrupt

This really doesnt say me anything the above didn't.
Next thing I tried was:
parsemce-e 0 -b 4 -s b200000000070f0f -a 0
Output:
Status: (0) Restart IP invalid.
parsebank(4): b200000000070f0f @ 0
        External tag parity error
        CPU state corrupt. Restart not possible
        Error enabled in control register
        Error not corrected.
        Bus and interconnect error
        Participation: Generic
        Timeout:
        Request: Generic error
        Transaction type : Invalid
        Memory/IO : Other
Wich doesnt tell me anything either :(
Google suggest anything from broken CPU(bad), broken RAM(even more bad) to 
broken mainboard(Ouch..)
I'm going to let memtest run overnight. This is the easiest test I guess :)
