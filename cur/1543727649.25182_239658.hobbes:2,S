The problems with the SHA1 implementation is the least of random.c's
concerns.  But it's just bad taste to tell on-lookers "we use SHA-1" and you
actually don't.  It causes people to re-evailuate your implementation.
Ease of reading, ease of analysis are related to using proper implementations
of cryptographic primitives.

I'll credit you for breaking the ice if capi becomes a standard feature.  ;)
