No. don't you think I look things up in a dictionary before I
write a definition?
The Webster's "New Collegiate Dictionary", 150th Anniversary
Edition clearly  states;
1. EXAMPLE, PATTERN;esp: an outstandingly clear or typical
example or archetype.
It was stolen from the study of languages where it was used
to exhibit a word in all of its inflectional forms. It has
been corrupted to mean some "new view" of something while, in
fact, it is defined to mean EXAMPLE or PATTERN.
It is particularly irksome to me because I studied Latin in
High School, where I first encountered this word. My second
encounter was where somebody corrupted it to mean some kind
of new idea. Then some idiot named a company Paradigm and
the end was clear.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
