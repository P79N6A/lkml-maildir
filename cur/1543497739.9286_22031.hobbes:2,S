It isn't just about laptops - that install CD should install on all
computers.  There are lots of computers around that have 8MB (or less)
that people want to install Linux on - that's one of the attractions of
Linux: you can do more stuff with less hardware.
People don't want to have to pick an installation CD (one for laptops,
one for small memory, etc.).
I still think the answer for installation is some gross hack that can
call back to the real-mode BIOS to read more stuff from disk.  The El
Torito extensions talk about some kind of multi image thing - it sounds
like you can have the BIOS load the first thing, and then it can make
calls back to the BIOS to have another image loaded.  That would solve
this problem I think.

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
