True, but it's also much less useful. It assumes you can identify which
kernel image you booted, etc. For instance, you're debugging a machine
with an uptime of 120 days, and the admin you're helping doesn't know
which kernel he booted.. It's also not available at boot time, which is
a useful debugging feature. 
Now if only I could have stirred up this much discussion with my
patchnames patch..
