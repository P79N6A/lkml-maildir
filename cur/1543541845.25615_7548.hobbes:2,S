# The reason I get upset is that old utilities like "tar" will no longer
# work. 
And they won't work...why?
tar won't try and open myfile/foo unless it knows it's there, and it won't
try and do that unless stat() told it that it's a directory. And
stat() won't tell tar that myfile is a directory because it *isn't*. 
There's no loss of information compared to the current situation, where
*nothing* knows about the existence of the streams.
