That's no longer necessarily true with the recently-added
dump-to-an-application feature:
core_pattern:
  ...
. If the first character of the pattern is a '|', the kernel will treat
  the rest of the pattern as a command to run.  The core dump will be
  written to the standard input of that program instead of to a file.
That's new in 2.6.20 (maybe .19?) so people probably don't know about it.
