Rank is just for promotion and it's been this way since the original
standard. They're obviously not talking about size, as this would break
every single platform I've ever heard of, which have at least two of the
above the same size.

More commonly, many DSPs have a single operand size. And they're quite
frequently programmed in C. 
This is all silly though. What's important is are there any platforms we
care about where a void * will NOT fit in a long. The answer as far as I'm
aware is no. The reverse is not important as we'd be foolish to cast
something that wasn't intended to be used as a pointer to a pointer type.
Using per-arch types is, of course, the right way to do it for new code.
