When I used "here", I was just meaning our youthful linux southbridge
drivers team instead of the whole AMD. Sorry for the confusion to you.

Yes, absolutely AMD has lots of people with PCI and MSI experience,
but this MSI issue is mainly under the debug of our team now.
I think our team will cooperate with other teams more closely to provide
linux chipset support besides fixing the MSI problem in the future.

Thanks for your suggestion. I will continue to debug this problem next
Monday when I'm back to the office. 
Thanks
