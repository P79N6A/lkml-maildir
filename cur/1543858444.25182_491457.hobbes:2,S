Userspace IO (UIO) was never intended to replace all kinds of possible
drivers. We wanted to address the situation where a manufacturer of
industrial I/O cards wants to do a large part of his driver in userspace
to simplify his development process. That's all.
Most of these I/O cards have registers or dual ported RAM that can be
mapped to userspace. This is possible with a standard kernel and is done
every day. Problem is that you can't handle interrupts. UIO simply adds
this capability and offers a standardized interface.
The code Greg added to his tree can do this for most hardware found
on industrial IO boards. That's all we wanted to achieve for now. If 
somebody wants to support more sophisticated things, suggestions are
welcome.
