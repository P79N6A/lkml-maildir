Subject: Replacement of LD_PRELOAD?

Hello linux-kernel,
  I remember read some discussion about LD_PRELOAD being bad for optimization
long time ago (by Ulrich Drepper?). Has the situation changed since then. Or is there a
replacement for LD_PRELOAD? That is providing a hook function and then
we can replace some system or library functions at the run time.
Anyone?
Best regards,
