Well, I went out and swapped the PCI 3com Sportster modem with another
spare ISA Sportster I had lying around.  Set it up, same problem of
persist option not working properly.
Looking through the syslog again, I noticed this...
Aug 26 08:42:32 tilburybackup pppd[330]: Connect time 0.9 minutes.
Aug 26 08:42:32 tilburybackup pppd[330]: Sent 87 bytes, received 72 bytes.
Aug 26 08:42:32 tilburybackup pppd[330]: Couldn't release PPP unit: Invalid argument
Aug 26 08:42:33 tilburybackup pppd[330]: Script /etc/ppp/ip-down finished (pid 862), status = 0x1
Aug 26 08:43:27 tilburybackup pppd[330]: Serial connection established.
Aug 26 08:43:27 tilburybackup pppd[330]: using channel 2
Aug 26 08:43:27 tilburybackup pppd[330]: Couldn't create new ppp unit: Inappropriate ioctl for device
Aug 26 08:43:28 tilburybackup pppd[330]: Hangup (SIGHUP)
Furthermore, everytime it tries to reconnect, it increases the channel
count.  As well, this invalid argument on the release PPP unit seems odd.
I did find a way to get around having to wait 6 hours for the ISP to
hangup.  Just pulling the phone cable, letting it time out and attempt to
shut down, and then plugging the cable back in, works.
I finally did a work around:
tilburybackup:/etc/ppp/ip-down.d# cat reset
#!/bin/sh
if [ $PPP_TTY == "/dev/ttyS4" ]; then
        poff chatham
        pon chatham
fi
This fixes it for now(as poff shuts it down cleanly, but pppd's persist is
fubar)
Ideas?
Still running 2.4.19 with pppd 2.4.1
If I get desperate enough, I'll go try 2.2.21 the next time I'm in the
area of this facility, to see if it's pppd 2.4.1, or the 2.4.19 kernel
that's causing it.
