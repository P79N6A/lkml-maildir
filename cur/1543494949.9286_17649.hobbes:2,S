I have now completed my tests and I can reliably trigger the error after 1
or 2 minutes.
The error occurs when the tape stops streaming at the end of a tape buffer
( 16MB of data). I guess the ide tape drive chews up a lot of bus time
when it is settling so I will look into the parameters of the IDE tape
driver and see if they affect the problem.
I still get the problem with safe SCSI and both read and write caching
disabled.
