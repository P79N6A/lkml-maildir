Hi,
I'm trying to turn a kernel virtual address into a struct page that I can
then pass to tcp_sendpage().  
The kernel virtual address could be {kmalloc(),vmalloc(),kmap()}-ed memory,
and I guarantee that this memory will not be {kfree(),vfree(),kunmap()}-ed
until the socket has done with the page (i.e. all the data has been acked).
I'd have thought that vmalloc_to_page(kvaddr) should give me a page I could
use, since it is walking the page tables to find the pte for 'kvaddr', and
checking that the physical page is present.
However I find I'm sending garbage when I use this method.
Can anyone help me understand?
