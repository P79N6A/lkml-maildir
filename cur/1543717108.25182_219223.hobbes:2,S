The d_bucket logic does look a bit odd.
		dentry = hlist_entry(node, struct dentry, d_hash);
		/* if lookup ends up in a different bucket 
		 * due to concurrent rename, fail it
		 */
		if (unlikely(dentry->d_bucket != head))
			break;
		/*

		 * read memory barrier before any search key comparison 
		 */
		move_count = dentry->d_move_count;
There is a window between the d_bucket test and sampling of d_move_count. 
What happens if the dentry gets moved around in there?
Anyway, regardless of that, it is more efficient to test d_bucket _after_
performing the hash comparison.  And it seems saner to perform the d_bucket
check when things are pinned down by d_lock.
