Well if nothing else this shows that there is still significant disagreement.
I consider Peter's statement to be 100% wrong here, optimizing away the
access to b would be a clear violation of the standard. I thought that
the argument had been made in a clear and convincing manner, but apparently
some people completely refuse to be convinced!
