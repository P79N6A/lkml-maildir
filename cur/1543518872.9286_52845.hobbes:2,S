That's OK, the new shmid number are great big hairy numbers:
the hex value is 0x2370002: it's the third (2, 0-based) shm segment, and the
sequence number is 0x46e (shmid/32768). These changes were nessecary to add
sysctl support.

There were major changes in the shm code, and I couldn't test them on a
64-bit computer. Could you please compile and run the attached test program?
    ./shmtst 8 100000 20 20 0
or
    ./shmtst 8 100000 20 20 1    [you'll see lots of messages about deleted
segments]
Btw, are you running a SMP or UP kernel?
