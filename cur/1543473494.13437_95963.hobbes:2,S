Actually, it was myself :-)

[SNIP]
I'd like to put some order in this issue:
At the time I reported the bug, I found a temporary bypass that enabled
me to use it on our system. A while later I received an excellent patch
from Martin Mares. Basically he rewritten the BOOTP code to rely on its
own routines, instead of needing to hack the IP layer. A small followup
patch he sent (privately) finished the job. It now works perfectly here.
Since I didn't see it in 2.1.132-acX series, I asked him, and he said:

Martin, Dave: please send the complete patch to Linus/Alan so they will
merge it into 2.2.0-per2.
Thanks !
Oren.
