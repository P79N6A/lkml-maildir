The following code is picked from drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c:
static struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu_load(struct kvm *kvm, int vcpu_slot)
{
       struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu = &kvm->vcpus[vcpu_slot];
       mutex_lock(&vcpu->mutex);
       if (unlikely(!vcpu->vmcs)) {
               mutex_unlock(&vcpu->mutex);
               return 0;
       }
       return kvm_arch_ops->vcpu_load(vcpu);
}
Obviously, it used 0 rather than NULL when returning a pointer to
indicate an error. Should we fix such issue?

I think it's more clear to indicate we are using a pointer rather than
an integer when we use NULL in kernel. But in userspace, using NULL is
for portbility of the program, although most (*just* most, NOT all) of
NULL's defination is ((void*)0). ;-)
