Well, my understanding of the patch is that it removes all of the
bash'ism and related from the script, so that any shell which will
accept things from the above URL will work.  So one of two things will
happen when /bin/sh != /bin/bash
1. The shell is complaint, and modulo bugs in the shell or script, it
will work.  This should be the common case.
2. The shell is not compliant, and the system is misconfigured.
