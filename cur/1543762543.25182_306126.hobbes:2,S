Hello,
After a first attempt of discussion on lkml, I'd like to get your
feedback on the following points.
I've noticed that since recent kernel versions, it's not possible
anymore to use simultaneously new and old megaraid driver.
It seems to have been introduced by that changeset:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/diffs/drivers/scsi/megaraid/Kconfig.megar
aid@1.1??nav=index.html|src/.|src/drivers|src/drivers/scsi|src/drivers/scsi/mega
raid|hist/drivers/scsi/megaraid/Kconfig.megaraid
It particularly makes life of people developing kernel for distro
difficult as it forces them to drop support for legacy hardware which is
working just fine with 2.6, or to patch their own kernel build.
As well it prevents simultaneous usage of new and old cards in the same
system.
As notes by James Bottomley and Christoph Hellwig the best thing to do
is probably to remove support for cards in the old driver that are still
supported by the new driver.
I'd like to propose a patch but looking at the code I have the following
question: the card id 101E:1960 seems to be supported by the new driver
as per the header of megaraid_mbox.c but in reality I was unable to boot
my system which uses that precise card with the new driver.
Are they mistakes in the header file ? Should they be removed from the
new driver (if they don't work) or from the old if they work ?
My current status is the following (just for discussion)
