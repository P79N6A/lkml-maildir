Hi.  I was wondering if there has been any discussion of kernel
regression testing.  Wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to depend
on human testers to verify every change didn't break something?
OK, I'll admit I haven't given this a lot of thought.  What I'm
wondering is whether the user-mode linux could help here (allow a way
to simulate controlled activity).
