kbuild 2.5 does
  '-nostdinc -I/usr/lib/gcc-lib/... gcc version ../include/'
so it allows includes from the compiler headers.  The problem is:
  bonding.c includes limits.h, picked up from gcc, OK.
  limits.h includes syslimits.h from gcc, OK.
  syslimits.h tries to include_next <limits.h> to get the user space
  limits, not OK.
Any kernel code that includes limits.h or syslimits.h is polluted by
user space headers.  net/bonding.c does not even need limits.h.
