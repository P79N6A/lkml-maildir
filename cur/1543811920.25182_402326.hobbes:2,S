This one, since it'll wrap around and consume two cpu dma table entries.
Since we are already at the max of 256 already from the beginning,
there's no way we can split this one.

Ditto for that one, will also be split into two 2kb entries.
So this first mapping dump shows us that we start with 256 entries, that
IDE would like to map into 258 entries. The question is why these dma
address as mapped by pci_map_sg() aren't page aligned? Andi?
