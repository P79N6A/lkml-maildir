xmms was running yes. But I think the oops happened on replug.
Long story: i had the headset connected during boot and my XMMS
insisted on outputing its music on it, which wasn't intended -- 
i wanted it on the speakers connected to the motherboard sound chip.
So i unplug the headset and restarted alsa initialization,
but it was very unhappy about cleaning up and couldn't initialize
the other sound card. I replugged the headset and then
I got the oops.
