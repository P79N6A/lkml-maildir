Hi,
I'm looking for some serious kernel trainings and specifically in the
VFS area (in Europe if possible). This training should address these
peculiar subjects:
        - VFS
        - Page cache
        - Block device drivers
        - VFS synchronisation
        - Study of a simple FS like Cramfs
At the end of the training sessions, I'd like to be able to write my
own very very basic FS.
I'd like to know if someone could advice or share a great experience.
I'm not looking for technical books (well except if they are great)
because I'd like to get good knowledges in a short time with practical
exercices.
Thanks for your answers

Francis
