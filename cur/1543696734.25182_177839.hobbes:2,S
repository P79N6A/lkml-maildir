The thing is, those "enable input pins" are actually GPIO's, and some 
boards don't use them as cable detect enables..
The whole thing should probably be done as a PCI quirk. Anyway, I'll
change my patch to be the absolute minimal one, ie just adding the
!isa_dev test instead of removing the old confused logic. I'm pretty 
certain that we shouldn't touch those GPIO's at all, but since some boards 
probably _do_ want them enabled, let's go for the minimal "avoid oops" 
approach.
