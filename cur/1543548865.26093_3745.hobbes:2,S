   My suggestion is indeed effectivly (almost) doubling the inode size.
   However, it provides an upgrade path, where you can double-boot with a
   kernel that DOESN"T know about the inodes.
The 2.2 kernels already compute EXT2_INODE_SIZE based on a value in the
superblock.  So an old kernel will be able to deal correctly if we
double the size of the inodes.
Credit me with at least *some* foresight.  :-)
