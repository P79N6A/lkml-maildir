You keep mentioning a 'true capabilities-based system' when you're realy
discussing a mutilated capability LIST design. Please don't confuse the two,
obviously different, concepts.
As for the 'topic', your fundamental problems lie not in the dillema of using
sticky and suid bits. Your fundamental problems lie in the inadequacy of the
POSIX privileges concept to provide a competent security mechanism and in the
nature of existing subsystems and mechanisms which were not designed with
security in mind but actively participate in the security subsystem - both of
which manifest in the ad-hoc-ness of the proposed solution(s).
