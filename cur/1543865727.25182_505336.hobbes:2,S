nfsd in particular tends to be a bit lazy about passing around vfsmount
info. Forcing it to do so should not be hard since the vfsmount is
already cached in the "struct export" (which can be found using the
filehandle). It will take a bit of re-engineering in order to pass that
information around inside the nfsd code, though.
Note also that it might be nice to enforce the vfsmount argument by
replacing the existing dentry parameters with a struct path instead of
adding an extra reference to the vfsmount to existing functions.
Cheers,
