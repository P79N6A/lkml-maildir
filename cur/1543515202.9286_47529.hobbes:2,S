I compiled 2.3.25 with support for the ALIM15x3, which works fine, except
for the cdrom. The cdrom works fine if it's turned off.
This is what I get when booted with it compiled in:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.20

I also tried this without scsi emulation, didn't work either.
without it compiled in I get:

when trying to mount I got this:
