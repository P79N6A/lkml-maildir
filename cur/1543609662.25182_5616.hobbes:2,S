Macs have had them since, what, 1984?  It's never been a question of it
being a problem, but it hasn't caught on on the PC.

Unfortunately other people don't seem to see it that way, and so it
doesn't happen.  People ship USB floppies with new laptops, so there is
clearly a demand for them.  I believe that if LS-120 had been where the
Zip drive was for a brief while, it would have stuck, just because of the
compatibility issue.
