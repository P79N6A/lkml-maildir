Ok, I agree that it would be good to have a hard limit exported.
I am less certain that VLAN should modify any MTU based on this
information, but at the very least, it could warn the user that
some action needs to be taken and let the user make an informed
decision.
Also, it seems that most (all?) ethernet chips can handle the extra
4 bytes, but the patches are varying degrees of ugliness and so
many have not made it into the kernel proper.

It would be a disaster with any IP protocol, not just UDP.
