Yes. Unable to deal with the global root, but it's not hard to add. The
right solution being to add the full-fledged namespaces, though. Doable,
but will require some NFS cleanup beforehand.

Oh, *that* is mostly done. I've written re-exec stuff about a year ago
(heck, year and half) and it's in sysvinit since 2.74. telinit u and there
you go. It may require a bit of cleanup - I can't tell right now how well
it will work on the early stages, but fixing it should be easy. It creates
a pipe, writes signature there, forks, child marshalls the state through
the pipe, parent does exec(), main() sees the pipe open (IIRC on
descriptor 11), reads the signature and decides that it should read the
state. Then it parses the state (passed in text form) and resumes the
normal work. Child exits when it had fed everything to the pipe. It is
used for libc and init upgrades without rebooting (at least by Debian).
Remaining cleanup shouldn't be hard - most likely it would be the matter
of passing several additional items.
