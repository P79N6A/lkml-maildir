Now here is a strange thing: I see it in my brothers ADSL linux router
syslog *before* they moved it to another place in their room two weeks ago.
Now it never appears, and before it appeared about once a day. They are
using 2.4.13 with ext3.
I'm starting to believe it has something to do with the parallel port being
unconnected, thus sending random signals to the mobo causing an interrupt?
If this is the case it is very possible that it has to do with correct
grounding also...
