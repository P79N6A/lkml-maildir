	maybe the problem running RTC in non-UTC time is known to you, 
	including its implications. Basically the kernel lacks two things 
	when booting:
	1) time zone
	2) Whether RTC runs UTC or local time
	My solution would be:
	1) Add a kernel parameter like RTC=UTC|local
	2) Add a kernel parameter like TZ=+0200 (numeric notation ised in 
	EMail)
	3) Enhance routines that set the system time to update the RTC as well
	I some people can convince me that it's a good idea, I might develop 
	a patch...
	Regards,

Hmm. You are acquainted with the settimeofday() system call?
Including the strange `warp clock' semantics on the first call?
You are also acquainted with the hwclock program?
