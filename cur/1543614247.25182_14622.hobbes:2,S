OK, back into the killfile you go.
Hint: instead of wanking in public try to _think_ for a while.  Requirements
to archive format:
	* can be generated with minimum of code
	* can be parsed <ditto>
	* can be handled by standard utilities
That's it.  Both cpio(1) and tar(1) (or pax(1) that can do both) fit the last
one.  And tar loses on the first two - it's messier.  Not much, but enough
to make the choice obvious.  "Popular" is completely irrelevant here - as long
as it's handled by standard UNIX utilities it's OK.
