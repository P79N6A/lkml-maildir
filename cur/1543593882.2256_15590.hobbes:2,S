I have been trying to figure out what is using my memory
My box has 
320280K
From boot I see
   924	kernel
  8224	reserved (initrd ramdisk?)
  1488	hash tables (dentry, inode, mount, buffer, page, tcp)
from lsmod I caculate
   876	for loaded modules
from proc/slabinfo
 11992	for all slabs
from proc/meminfo
 17140	buffer
123696	cache
 32303	free
leaving unaccounted
123627K 	
This is about 38% of my memory, and only about 46% is pageable
Is it possible to figure out what is using this?
This is with 2.4.6-pre2 with Rik's page_launder_improvements patch, 
lvm beta7 and some reieserfs patches applied, after about 12 hours
of uptime.
TIA,
Ed Tomlinson
