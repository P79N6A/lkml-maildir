That's true, I should also have included badly-/stupidly- designed
mailstore architectures in the list of possibilities.  :-)
Stepping back for a moment, do you really need such semantics?  After
all, when you're dealing with Maildir, even if you're not dealing with
rename(), you still have to worry about programs deleting or inserting
(or moving between Mailboxes) messages out from under you while you
are doing the readdir() scan.
Since by definition Maildir is lockless, it is expected that
applications be able to deal with such changes.  If they can't, either
the design of Maildir is busted (and I have my own opinions of DJB's
designs, which aren't worth going into here) or the application is
busted.  Take your pick.

But directory sizes are unlimited --- they could conceivably be
hundreds of megabytes, and so it's not reasonable to require the
kernel to do the snapshot using unpageable kernel memory.

Not given the POSIX readdir/opendir interface!
(And if we have the freedom to redesign the readdir POSIX interface,
there are plenty of other changes I'd make along the way.  Nuking
telldir and seekdir would be near the top of the list.  If you want
an example of truly brain-damaged design, just take telldir and
seekdir... please!)

Actually, you can do this today, if you use the underlying
sys_getdents64 system call.  But the application would have to
allocate potentially a very large amount of userspace memory.
