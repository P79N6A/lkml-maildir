I agree that it is an I/O issue but I always consider that big endian is
superior (and for little endian to make sense, strings should be stored
backwards). The ultimate idiocy[1] is standard scientific notation with
exponent on one side and most significant digit on the other. As an
astronomer, I often disregard all the intermediate digits, the only
interesting part are the exponent[2] and (marginally) the first digit (to
help rounding up or down the exponent). And I definitely don't want my
numbers right adjusted, that may be ok for beancounters, not for
scientists (actually I find reading IEEE floating point values in hex on
BE machines much more logical). 
BTW: casting of integer pointers in C is a nop AFAICT, simply the size
of the data accessed by the pointer is changed.

'Arabic' numbers were actually imported from India and a left-to-right
original script IIRC. Anyway let us agree to disagree.

[1] The other one is the 68000 family of processors when single bit
instructions use little endian numbering but bit field instuctions
(introduced with the 68020) big endian (IOW a bit field of 1 bit is not a
single bit). In a big endian machine, bit 0 is the MSB, period.
[2] "If you hear '10 to the 40 within a factor of 2' in an astronomical
congress, you have to understand that the factor of 2 applies to the
exponent." (I can't remember the source, sigh...)
