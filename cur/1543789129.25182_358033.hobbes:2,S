The patch is for hid-core.c - I don't think it is device specific - original problem 
should affect all High Speed USB HID devices. 
To summarize -
Current code just looks plain wrong since the same logic is repeated twice - endpoint->bInterval is operated upon twice if the device is HIGH SPEED one.
if (dev->speed == USB_SPEED_HIGH)
                         interval = 1 << (interval - 1);
This is first done in hid-code.c:usb_hid_configure() which then passes interval to  usb.h:usb_fill_int_urb() which again repeats the same logic as above!
