I did not look for others. It would seem that SCSI and networking are
affected as well. SCSI due to the sense buffer.

There might be several buffers in one page. You'd have to count
DMA users in struct page.
Secondly are you sure that a physical page won't be accessed
by several different virtual addresses ? On some architectures
that would kill us.
