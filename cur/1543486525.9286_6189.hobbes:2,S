I have kernel 2.2.1 with patch ac6 applied for my Acard SCSI card to
work (cd-writer attached to it).
The card is correctly detected (just like with 2.0.37, where it was
working perfectly), but the boot process (or module insertion, with
modularized SCSI support) gets stuck with the following messages in
/var/log/messages.
My config is Asus P2B, PII400, 128Mb/10Gb IDE, RedHat 5.2 upgraded to
kernel 2.2.1-ac6 (I made the necessary upgrades before going to
2.2.1).
The problem arises with SCSI compiled into the kernel as well as with
modularized SCSI support.
Any hint?
If someone provides a patch, I'm ready to test it and to report the
results.
Thanks in advance.
The messages are:
