I'm wondering about the scope of this.  My Ethernet adapter with, maybe, 20
counter fields would have 20 counters allocated for each of my 16
processors.
The only way to get the total would be to use statctr_read() to merge them.
Same for the who knows how many IP counters etc., etc.
How many and which counters were converted for the test you refer to?
I do like the idea of a uniform access mechanism, though.  It is well in
line
with my thoughts about an architected interface for topology and
instrumentation
so I'll definitely get back to you as I try to collect requirements.
