Btw, Roland, instead of your previous patch I would prefer something that 
just makes "sig_ignored()" test the state of the signal better. Ie 
something like the appended.
This should bring it much closer to the old code, which got this _right_. 
For example, a signal that is blocked is _never_ ignored, since even if 
the handler is SIG_IGN right now, it may not be by the time it is 
unblocked.
I bet the blocked case accounts for some of the new test failures, while
the (SIG_DFL && sig_kernel_ignore(sig)) case will account for a few more.  
In general I _think_ this should get us pretty much back to the old
behaviour.
At least this fixes the pipe write() / SIGWINCH testcase for me.
