Subject: [PATCH 004 of 8] knfsd: Close a race-opportunity in d_splice_alias
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There is a possible race in d_splice_alias.
Though __d_find_alias(inode, 1) will only return a dentry
with DCACHE_DISCONNECTED set, it is possible for it to get cleared
before the BUG_ON, and it is is not possible to lock against that.
There are a couple of problems here.
Firstly, the code doesn't match the comment.  The comment describes
a 'disconnected' dentry as being IS_ROOT as well as DCACHE_DISCONNECTED,
however there is not testing of IS_ROOT anythere.
A dentry is marked DCACHE_DISCONNECTED when allocated with
d_alloc_anon, and remains DCACHE_DISCONNECTED while a path is built up
towards the root.  So a dentry can have a valid name and a valid
parent and even grandparent, but will still be DCACHE_DISCONNECTED
until a path to the root is created.  Once the path to the root is
complete, everything in the path gets DCACHE_DISCONNECTED cleared.  So
the fact that DCACHE_DISCONNECTED isn't enough to say that a dentry is
free to be spliced in with a given name.  This can only be allowed if
the dentry does not yet have a name, so the IS_ROOT test is needed too.
However even adding that test to __d_find_alias isn't enough.  As
d_splice_alias drops dcache_lock before calling d_move to perform the
splice, it could race with another thread calling d_splice_alias to
splice the inode in with a different name in a different part of the
tree (in the case where a file has hard links).  So that splicing code
is only really safe for directories (as we know that directories only
have one link).  For directories, the caller of d_splice_alias will be
holding i_mutex on the (unique) parent so there is no room for a race.
A consequence of this is that a non-directory will never benefit from
being spliced into a pre-exisiting dentry, but that isn't a problem.
It is perfectly OK for a non-directory to have multiple dentries, some
anonymous, some not.  And the comment for d_splice_alias says that it
only happens for directories anyway.
