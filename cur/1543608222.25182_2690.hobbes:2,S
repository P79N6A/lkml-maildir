It should probably be mentioned that you're using a really old version of 
ESD, and that they've at least made it so that you'll get the right one 
for any BE machine.  NE is still the better answer though -- now their 
configure script figures out BE/LE, and it'll build wrong if you're 
crosscompiling.
