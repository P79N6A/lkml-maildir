I was really hoping I could help make things work for everyone
because they are not working for everyone now.
Unfortunately, now I also see a future without working sound drivers on
ARM and several others. I'm sorry. I tried, but I've completely run out
of ideas (hell, most of them weren't even mine to begin with, so that
goes back to even before I gave up) and thus far every possible method
of fixing this has been shot down.
... and here I thought fixing drivers was the Right Thing to Do (TM).
