Subject: Cuecat-ers:  update on base-64 conversion table.

After some work, I've discovered that the base-64 decode is based on the 
following decode table:
  char   map[66] =
        "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
        "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
        "0123456789"
        ",-\0";
The only change from the previously-published information is the graphic in 
the next-to-last character position in the table, position 62.  The earlier 
documents stated this should be a plus sign; in fact it should be a 
comma.  It took reading 400 barcode symbols before I discovered the error 
and determined the correction, so don't anyone feel they "blew it" -- it 
doesn't happen often at all, and only when you are working with Code 128 or 
the CatCue equivalent.  When reading UPC, ISDN, and other numeric-only 
barcodes this particular position isn't used (not enough one-bits density).
More information on cues can be found at 
http://www.fluent-access.com/wtpapers/cuecat/index.html,
 and some 
interesting tools for creating traditional-looking barcode presentations of 
cues (as opposed to the stylized slanted-bar version that you find in the 
Radio Shack catalog, Forbes magazine, and other places) can be found at
