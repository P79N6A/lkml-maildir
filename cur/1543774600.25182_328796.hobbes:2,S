"Plugins" is a bad word.  This user's combination of plugins is most
likely identical to other users', it's just which ones are enabled, and
which aren't?  If they are all included, I assume they play nice.
And just because they are called "plugins" doesn't mean the EA looks
different every week.
I cannot stress this enough.  In Reiser4, EVERYTHING is some sort of
plugin.  We now have a standard disk format plugin, and a standard set
of plugins providing UNIX filesystem-like things (vanilla files,
directories, symlinks, device nodes, named pipes...) which has been
stable for some time.
I see no problems with providing at least as consistent an EA interface
as any other FS, only more extensible because it's not flat.

Interface is the same.  Only, zip files aren't just compression, so
maybe the interface changes a little there.
Point is, now you have a standard interface for any program to access
any simple lossless compression, transparently.

What's this got to do with anything?

In file-as-a-directory (which is probably NOT happening soon), bar.zip
is both the actual zipfile and the view inside, depending on whether you
try to open() it directly or peek inside it as a directory.
I've used that interface for some simpler things like file permissions.
 I could do things like "echo 0 > some_file/metas/uid".  The interface
is gone for now, because it broke some things, I'm told, but nothing
serious for me while I was using it.  I don't think the problem is
insurmountable.
However, let's not discuss this now.  I do NOT want to start another
"silent semantic changes with reiser4" thread.  File-as-directory is not
happening this time, so don't worry about it -- this time.

You're misunderstanding.  man zip.
$ zip bar foo
creates/modifies a file named "bar.zip", not "bar", which contains the
file "foo".

Or, I can avoid those issues altogether, and simply delegate this kind
of stuff to user-created-but-magic directories.  For instance, I could
have a directory called "/foo" which contains encrypted files, and
"/foo/decrypted" which has transparently decrypted representations of them.

True, for now.  But for me, it's not hard at all to try "cp" first, and
after it fails, Google and install the required tool.  After all, most
users already have to do that with GUI interfaces, this just takes the
GUI way of doing things (like in file-roller) and makes it perform
better and work with all programs.  Not necessarily all formats, but all
programs.
