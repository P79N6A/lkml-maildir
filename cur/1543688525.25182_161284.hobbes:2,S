first of all, once fs gets mounted with extents support any newly created
files/dirs will be stored in extents-format. thus, if you remount that fs
w/o extents support you won't be able to access those files/dirs.
I really propose you don't use extents on a partitions you care about for a while.

quite interesting result. could you help me to investigate that?
it would be great to go through following steps:
1) create fresh ext3 fs
2) mount it w/o extents option
3) run dbench 16 for few times (say, 4)
   make sure it performs on that filesystem (cd <mntpoint>; dbench -c ... 16)
4) unmount fs
5) recreate that fs
6) mount it with extents option
   'EXT3-fs: file extents enabled' should be printed in logs
7) run dbench 16 for few times
8) unmount that fs and take a look in logs, you should see stats info about
   extents usage
thank you!
