Known, XFS was broken / breaking wrt suspend. Pavel fixed this with the
XFS guys IIRC and i think those patches were on lkml also, but am not
sure. => this should work soon.

Yes. Almost all drivers that are not commonly used in notebooks are
totally ignorant of suspend / resume. Even the brand new SATA driver
stuff (that is actually in almost every new notebook) had no suspend
support until some days ago.
