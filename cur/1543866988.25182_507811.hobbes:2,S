Yes. Those who are concerned with the fstype and mount like
    mount -t fstype device mountpoint
apparently expect mount/fstab line like
    device mountpoint fstype ...
Of course the fstype could be fuse.subtype or fuseblk.subtype but that 
would add a needless complexity (also, for example ntfs-3g uses both and 
it decides run-time which one to use).

I think it's definitely an improvement because it solves real problems, 
though perhaps not the way users would expect.
