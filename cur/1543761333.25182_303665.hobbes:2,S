Hi-
Our io_remap_pfn_range() patches don't contain many collisions.
My first patch [adding io_remap_pfn_range() to all arches]
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mm&m=111049473410099&w=2>
does go a little further than yours in that regard.
Also, I was under the impression (only, so this is a question)
that this type of construct (from your patch):
+#ifndef io_remap_pfn_range
+#define io_remap_pfn_range remap_pfn_range
+#endif
only works for #defines (macros), while in some arches
io_remap_page_range() (and presumably io_remap_pfn_range)
is a function [sparc32/64] or inline function [mips].
My first patch referenced a future patch to convert
all callers of io_remap_page_range() to io_remap_pfn_range(),
which I have now done and built succesfully on 8 arches.
I'll post it now.
