I think that hwclock --hctosys is not quite straightforward operation
-- it needs to know if your CMOS clock are in local timezone or GMT,
or something like that, IIRC.
But this might work: compute difference between system and cmos time
before suspend, and use that info to restore time after suspend.

I disagree here.
If I do cli(); sleep(5 hours); sti();, system should survive that. If
you do cli(); sleep(5 hours); sti() but fail to compensate for lost
ticks, all sorts of funny things might happen if you are comunicating
with someone who did not sleep.
