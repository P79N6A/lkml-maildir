Hello all...
	Just reporting a problem, haven't got a solution.
	Latest ipsec snapshots won't patch into the 2.3.25 kernel.  Looks
like some significant changes to .../linux/include/linux/proc_fs.h results
in failed patch attempt.  Comparing proc_fs.h from 2.3.24 to 2.3.25, it
looks like the whole net_directory_inos enum table has been stripped
out and all that's left is PROC_NET_LAST.  That gets the ipsec patch,
that's attempting to add entries to that enum, real unhappy.
	Mike
