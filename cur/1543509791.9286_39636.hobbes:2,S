2.2.13pre9 is still missing lots of fixes from me.
These are the missing patches from me:
SA_INTERRUPT-shared-1:	avoids SA_INTERRUPT to break SA_SHIRQ.
SMP-boot-race-2.2.10-B:	avoid the first CPU to launch the first kernel
			thread (so calling the scheduler code) before
			the other CPUs had a chance to enter sys_idle()
			to set cpu_curr() != NULL.
bh-SMP-races-2.2.10-A:	fixes the bh_mask_count/bh_mask smp races (ala
			sparc).
buffer-races-2.2.10-A:	fixes genuine race in set_blocksize and
			invalidate_buffers and make sure the
			invalidate buffers are placed in the freelist.
endbase-2.2.10:		safely heuristic to read the EDBA register from
			the bios (old hardware will run fine as default).
			If you don't have a bios you can override via
			kernel param.
flush-tlb-i386-1:	invlpg if not present must be replaced with
			a %%cr3 noop write and not with a flush of
			the current task.
hashed-buffers-2.2.10:	really a minor issue, the right place for
			updating the hashed-buffers stats is in the
			path that really remove the buffer from the
			hashtable.
no-swapout-2.2.10-B:	allow 2.2.12 to run on real servers without
			swapin/swapouts all the time (for example during
			heavy filesystem activity) that make 2.2.x
			unuseable otherwise (people was using 2.0.x before
			this my fix).
ntp-SMP-races-1:	fix for settimeofday/stime/adjtimex
			SMP races. I don't claim it to fix the
			fix for RTC screwedup with ntpd on SMP but it's
			sure good to have such bug fixed too.
oom-2.2.12-I:		Fix a bad deadlock condition in the swapin
			code that may soft-deadlock the machine during
			swapout activities if the swapin is triggered
			inside the kernel and the swapin can't allocate
			the page. It's pretty easy to trigger this race
			simply generating some syslog message (for example
			logging in via network) while the machine is going
			to sigkill a task in oom(). It also fixes the
			SIGBUS accessing a shared mapping beyond the
			end of the file on Alpha. Also avoids iopl()
			application to be SIGKILLED and send a
			graceful SIGTERM that avoid screwing up the
			console by going out of memory.
			This breaks all architectures but it's strictly
			necessary. I fixed only Alpha and i386 so far
			as I have no other hardware.
probe-irq-2.3.14-pre2-1: avoid adding workarounds in the code by probing
			 two times for irqs. The problem is that an irq
			 may be pending just a bit before probing irq
			 and so such pending irq was mistaken for
			 a spurious irq so causing the probe to fail.
shrink_all_cache-2.2.10-A: set to zero the minimum limit of cache and
			   buffers. This goes with the no-swapout patch
			   for big memory servers.
smp-reschedule-boot-2.3.13-1: fix a race in the SMP boot that was
			      causing the master CPU to reschedule the
			      future dummy idle task of a secondary
			      cpu instead of continuing the boot stage
			      (so i386 8 (or more) way SMP will 
			       boot fine without hanging in wait-for-callout)
wakeup_bdflush-2.2.10-A: avoid a deadlock in wakeup_bdflush.
			 run_task_queue() will sleep if we are flushing
			 loop buffers to disk.
