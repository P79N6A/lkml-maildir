Except there is no way to give you enough information to munmap the page.
As the address passed to munmap must be page aligned.
The current policy appears to make an application think as up front
as possible about the need to be page aligned when talking to mmap,
while not being overly harsh.  We do have the silent rounding
up of length until it is a multiple of PAGE_SIZE.
Beyond this the internal linux implementation of mmap does not even
see the extra bits in the offset.  Instead the most recent syscall
entry point takes an argument as to which page you want to mmap from
the device.  This allows much larger devices to be mmaped while
still using 32bit arithmetic.
So I neither see that it is easy or even desirable to ``fix'' mmap.
