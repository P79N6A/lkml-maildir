Having read that last night, I went home and used "make zImage" and
"make bzImage" on the configuration that "make zImage" worked on on
the said laptop, copied them both over to the laptop, made entries in
/etc/lilo.conf for both of them, then tried them both out...
Once again, the zImage version worked, and the bzImage version didn't,
so there's definately something here - and, since they're both built
from the same configuration file...
Mind if I ask a couple of questions:
 1. How much RAM do you have, Tom?
 2. Is there a minimum RAM size for bzImage to work?
Best wishes from Riley.
