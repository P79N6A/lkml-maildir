Interactive is not the best word, but I would not expect a process like
the one I described to be considedred a CPU hog.  It's a deadline driven
semi realtime process.

I think the problem I have (that I loose a lot of performance to processes
such as crond, httpd, etc.) is common to the whole class of semi-realtime
processes, at least if they use >50% CPU.  This means that CPU intensive
audio and video (e.g. DVD) playback programs might have the same problem.
I see three simple ways to solve the problem without changing the
scheduler.  Either run the process with nice -20, use SCHED_RR, or use a
dedicated server with no other processes (such as crond, httpd, etc).  
The first two might be OK, but you need root privilegies to run renice and
to change the scheduler policy.  The third one is not an option for all
users, and definately not for the video playback case.
A problem is that this new scheduler behaviour will hit people running
semi realtime processes as a regression when they switch to 2.6.  It would
be nice to avoid that.
One solution might be to teach the scheduler how to detect these deadline
driven semi-realtime processes, and not punish them.  It is not obvious to
me how to do that.
Another much simpler solution that might work just as well is be to change
the CPU utilization threshold from 50% to 90%.
You're the expert of course.  I'm only fumbling in the dark...  :-)

I'll try it out and let you know if it does make a difference.
