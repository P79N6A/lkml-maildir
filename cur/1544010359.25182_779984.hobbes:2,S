I think they'd still be pretty useful.  They would be certainly harder
to track down, but "something allocating N bytes from the slab is
leaking" is certainly better than nothing.

It is supposed to give cleaner stack traces.  But if you don't strictly
require it, I'd leave it up to whatever the user had set before.  If
people are getting crappy stack traces from anywhere in the kernel, I
think they know where to go to fix it. ;)

I was just worried that debugfs was the only mechanism for this feature
to get its data in and out of the kernel.  If it was not there, that
this feature was useless.
The problem with 'select' when it is "mixed" with 'depends':
config DEBUG_FS
        bool "Debug Filesystem"
        depends on SYSFS
When you 'select DEBUG_FS' it will *not* turn on SYSFS:
$ egrep 'DEBUG_FS|MEMLEAK|G_SYSFS' .config
# CONFIG_SYSFS is not set
CONFIG_DEBUG_FS=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMLEAK=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMLEAK_TEST=y
I also tried compiling your feature with a bunch of things turned off in
my .config: 
http://sr71.net/~dave/linux/kmemleak.config
I got a compile error:
/home/dave/work/temp/linux-2.6/mm/memleak-test.c: In function ‘memleak_test_init’:
/home/dave/work/temp/linux-2.6/mm/memleak-test.c:61: error: ‘files_cachep’ undeclared (first use in this function)
/home/dave/work/temp/linux-2.6/mm/memleak-test.c:61: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
/home/dave/work/temp/linux-2.6/mm/memleak-test.c:61: error: for each function it appears in.)
make allnoconfig is cool. :)
