Good news! :-) memtest86+ refused to boot, since I have too much memory (2GB)
and this somehow interferes with grub, but mprime (my other favourite tool
for this kind of testing) quite quickly bombed out. (This in itself usually
means bad RAM, bad motherboard or some interrupt handler messing up badly.)
I moved the RAM from DIMM slot 3+4 to 1+2, and suddenly things became a _lot_
better. I definitely can't say it's oops-free yet, since it's only been
running a couple of hours, but this certainly points towards that the larger
part of my issues were some odd sort of motherboard hiccup.
I take it this also frees the dm, md and NUMA code of most suspicion --
consider the issues fixed for now, and I'll be sure to bug you again if I
start to get oopses again. Sorry for wasting your time :-)
