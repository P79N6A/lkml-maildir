I realise that and I am just saying that doing that is pointless as it
only introduces overhead at no gain at all. If you  use one cpu you are
going to use all of them. Snd if you have one compressed file, you are
going to have lots of them. Frankly, I don't care about hotplug cpus. If
someone has a hotplug capable motherboard which costs thousands (tens of
thousands?) of dollars without even starting on the cpus they are not
going to care if the kernel is wasting a few megabytes of ram here or
there... And if they do then they should buy more RAM obviously they can
afford it... What I am worried about is wasting ram on low end systems and
my approach is just as effective as yours except it incurs less overhead,
be it only by a few cycles...

ps. I am away to catch a plane in a few minutes so won't be replying for a
