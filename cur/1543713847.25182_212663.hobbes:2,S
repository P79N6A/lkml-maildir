Well we do:
	if (condition-which-evaluates-to-constant-zero-on-CONFIG_HUGETLB=n)
		arch_hugetlb_fault();
so the compiler will never emit a call to the stub function anyway.
But it turns out the stub is needed for now, because !X86 doesn't implement
arch_hugetlb_fault().  So I put it back.

Well, it's best that the kernel actually compiles still..
