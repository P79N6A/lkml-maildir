I too are seeing this and can't remember seeing it so clearly in the past
as I do now. I've seen it in 2.4.10-ac12 and 2.4.15-pre7 and
2.4.16+your_patch_for_reads_while_writing.
I recently backuped my /home on a friends machine and then reformatted my
partition from reiserfs to ext3 and then put all the data back.
When I did this I saw this behaviour very clearly. I have quite a lot of
'vmstat 1' output that shows that the machine is recieving a lot of data
but not writing anything out, this is completely fine, but when the
diskoutput begins the networkinput stops and only continues after the
writeout is complete. There are variations to how much it stalls but it
always stalls for some time, sometimes a short while and sometimes until
the buffer is empty and then the story begins all over again.
the disk can sustain >30MB/s output and the network is 100Mbit/s so it a
maximum of 10-11MB/s in.
I sent the 'vmstat 1' output to Rik van Riel and the response I got on irc
was something like "ouch! Spikey!". he didn't think it should work like
this either. To me it seems that the writeout starts to late or that no
new data is put into the buffer while it's beeing emptied.

I'll try this tomorrow and give you a full report with vmstat output and
slabinfo/meminfo and whatever more you might want.

I'll try with 2.4.17-pre1 + your patches.
All my tests will be done on ext3 filesystems.

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
