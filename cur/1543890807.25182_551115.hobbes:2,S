It's not (only/mainly) about breaking.  File descriptors are a resources
which has to be used under the control of the program.  The runtime
cannot just steal some for itself.  This indirectly leads to breaking
code.  We've seen this many times and I keep repeating the same issue
over and over again: why do we have MAP_ANON instead of keeping a file
descriptor with /dev/null open?  Why is mmap made more complicated by
allowing the file descriptor to be closed after the mmap() call is done?
Take a look at a process running your favorite shell.  Ever wonder why
there is this stray file descriptor with a high number?
$ cat /proc/3754/cmdline
bash
$ ll /proc/3754/fd/
total 0

File descriptors must be requested explicitly and cannot be implicitly
consumed.
All that and the other problem I mentioned earlier today about auxiliary
data.  File descriptors are not the ideal interface.  Elegant: yes,
ideal: no.  Fro physics and math you might have learned that not every
result that looks clean and beautiful is correct.
