The driver support is simply too good in Linux so I haven't had the need
for writing a PCI driver until now. ;)

Specifications? Such luxury. This driver is based on googling and
reverse engineering. Any requests for specifications have so far been
put in the round filing cabinet.
What I know is that I have the registers:
* System address (32 bit)
* Block size (16 bit)
* Block count (16 bit)
From what I've seen these are written to once. So I'm having a hard time
believing these support more than one segment.

So from a driver point of view, this is just a matter of memory usage?
In that case, what is a good value? =)
Since there is no guarantee this will be mapped down to one segment
(that the hardware can accept), is it expected that the driver iterates
over the entire list or can I mark only the first segment as completed
and wait for the request to be reissued? (this is a MMC driver, which
behaves like the block layer)

Ok. Being a block device, the segments are usually rather large so the
overhead of setting up many DMA transfers shouldn't be that terrible.
