Ah!  Are you thinking of the trick that associates a reference counter
with each pointer, and where one uses a double-compare-and-swap instruction
to do updates?  That is definitely -not- what we are proposing here, since
it is important to avoid writes during read-only traversals.
Instead, we use side information to deduce when it is no longer possible
for there to be any references to a given data structure.
It -is- possible to use RCU in Linux -without- reference counts.  See
the Maneesh Soni's FD-management patch and description at:
http://lse.sourceforge.net/locking/patches/files_struct_rcu-2.4.10-04.patch
http://lse.sourceforge.net/locking/files_struct_rcu.txt
The reference counts are needed -only- in cases where references to an
RCU-protected data structure may be held across a sleep.  Dipankar Sarma's
IPV4 route-cache lookup patch at:
http://lse.sourceforge.net/locking/patches/rt_rcu-2.4.6-02.patch
is an example use of RCU where reference counts are used, since entries
can be queued.
                              Thanx, Paul
