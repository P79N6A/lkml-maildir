The device has a single interrupt though that interrupt at least can
tell you which queues need servicing. It can't mask the interrupt per
queue though, which is the main issue.
So while I think this scheme would work (the driver, ibm_emac, currently
uses a fake net_device and that sort-of works, budget is set a CONFIG_*
time though, I'm sure that can/needs to be improved), I've been
wondering all along if I could do something smarter by doing some
interrupt soft-disabling instead, though I have to get my head around
properly kicking softirqs from task context (if I need to re-trigger
from a enable_*() call occuring at task context).
I'm travelling at the moment, so I won't be able to have a serious look
for a little while though.
Cheers,
Ben.
