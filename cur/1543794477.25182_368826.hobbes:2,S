True; I'm trying to think of a good way to emulate 8000000 iterations
of loop, though. Really, this is not terrible to use 2 jiffies of
offset, as we try to sleep 1 jiffy each time. As long as we don't get
a signal *right* away, we'll sleep probably for 2 loops. Not sure,
though, may be useful to see what happens in practice and then debug
further for the right value.
May also want to use time_after_eq() not time_after().
Thanks,
Nish
