Hello Randy,
Thanks for the response.  I did not get time to look into this till now.  The way you suggested is to add module build process into kernel build.  This requires a user to build a loadable module with kernel together.  What I really want to is to have module build alone but include kernel symbols and variables so it will not have problem when loading.  The benefit of doing it is to make user and developer easy to change the code and rebuild without experiencing the kernel rebuild process every time.  I read those two documents and they mainly talking about how to build module with kernel together.
In2.4.x, there is a "Rules.make" which has all needed symbols and variables defined.  I just includes that file for my module build and everything works perfectly.  Now in 2.5.x, those structure has been changed and the "rule" files seem to be relocated under "scripts" and being changed too.  I am trying to make use of those "rules" to make module build and load simpler compare with build module with kernel each time.
Any ideas?
thanks and regards,
Eddie
