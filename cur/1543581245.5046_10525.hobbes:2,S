I'm also seeing a ps/2 mouse bug, with 2.4.0-pre5 (I think) on a 
CS433 (486/33 laptop) 
Freezes after some time in X, killing keyboard.
Is there a generic approach to finding where this sort of problem lies?
I note that there were problems in the 2.0.n era, that were fixed in
2.0.n+3 or so (I think 30), on the ct475, that were similar.
