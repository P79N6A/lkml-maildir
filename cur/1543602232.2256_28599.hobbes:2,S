Well, you don't need to remove the journal just to boot off of a rescue
disk.  The only requirement is that you have a clean unmount of the ext3
filesystem (although if you DO have a booting problem that can also be a
bit of a challenge).

I think you're wrong on this one.  As long as you unmount the filesystem,
resize2fs should be able to handle it (as will ext2resize).

Yes, this is one reason why removing the journal all the time is a bad
idea.  This won't be a problem at some point in the future when it is
possible for the ext3 code to mount an unjournaled filesystem (ala ext2),
but that still needs a bit of work that isn't very high priority.
Cheers, Andreas
