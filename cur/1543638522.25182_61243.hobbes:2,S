The use of "enabled" is confusing me. You aren't describing
the problem very well.
Do you mean that you cannot select in when you are doing
a "make menuconfig" or "make xconfig"?
Or do you mean that you have selected it, but it isn't being
compiled?
Or do you mean that you have it compiled, but the kernel
won't boot (or you can't modprobe the module)?
Or do you mean that it boots and the kernel shows
the catc driver (in /proc/bus/usb/drivers) but the 
device isn't being claimed (as shown in /proc/bus/usb/devices).
Exactly what are you trying to do, and what is happening?
Brad
