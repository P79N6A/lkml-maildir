In trying to do the Right Thing (tm) and compile the kernel without
root privilege, I discovered that the following files in the
standard linux-2.6.0 distribution seem to have read permission
for user and group but not other:
linux-2.6.0/Documentation/scsi/ChangeLog.megaraid
linux-2.6.0/drivers/input/joystick/grip_mp.c
linux-2.6.0/drivers/char/agp/isoch.c
linux-2.6.0/include/video/neomagic.h
I guess this needs fixing.
Merry Christmas -- Ross
