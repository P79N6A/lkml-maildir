As I understand it, the problem is that on some Itanium boxes, it's
possible to have the following code run:
	CPU 1				CPU 2
    spin_lock(&devlock);
    writel(foo);
    spin_unlock(&devlock);
				    spin_lock(&devlock);
				    writel(bar);
				    spin_unlock(&devlock);
and still have bar arrive at the device before foo.  One possibility
would be to add a read after the writel() to flush the posted write.
The proposed mmiowb() function is somewhat lighter weight -- it
guarantees that later writes will not hit the device before any writes
already issued, but it doesn't say anything about writes making it all
the way to the device.
I could be wrong but I think that the eieio in the ppc IO write
functions should be strong enough that mmiowb() can be a no-op.
By the way, are the ordering rules different for ppc32 and ppc64?  I
notice that the ppc32 out_xxx() functions do eieio while the ppc64
versions do a full sync.
Thanks,
  Roland
