That way they can still hit your inode quota, plus you can't keep hard
links yourself: Any rm(1) would clobber the file for good. But in any case,
if your environment is *this* hostile, you better take really extraordinary
measures. And there I'm afraid the rather weak traditional Unix security
model is way out of question anyway. I'd start thinking of relocating,
myself.
