Just an FYI,
NeroLINUX is also broken.  I can't successfully burn a DVD.

With cdrecord I can set the FIFO buffer size up to 20MB or so, which is 
locked in memory when running as root. The issue seems to be moving the 
data from the application buffer to the device buffer. Something in the 
kernel would appear to only do that data transfer on a timer tick. It 
may be that the dispatch latency is just too high, and that the thread 
pushing the data to the device is just not getting the CPU in time, even
with the application buffer locked and the application running at RT 
priority.
I generally build my kernels with voluntary preempt, I think I tried a 
real preempt kernel without improvement, but I can't swear to it. If the
O.P. doesn't mind a 14th build that might be a decent data point.
