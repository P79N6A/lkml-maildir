I find your faith in your fellow programmers to be trluy inspirational ;)

I'd suggest that any API which allows us to query the hugeness of a piece
of memory should also work for mmap(hugetld_fd...).  IOW: this capability
shouldn't be restricted to sysv shm areas.
I can't think of any syscall which can be sanely overloaded for this.
The most general way of exposing this info would be to export it in
/proc/pid/maps in some back-compatible manner.
And once I've lost the "oh oh we'd need to write 100 lines of userspace
code for that" bunfight I'd say add a new syscall sys_query_pagesize(void
*addr) which returns the size of the page which backs `addr'.
But then again, if it was possible to write 100 lines of userspace code, we
wouldn't need this capability at all.  I bet if the userspace guys tried a
bit harder they'd work out a way of teaching their applications to remember
what they did.
