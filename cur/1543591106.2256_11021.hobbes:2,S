Why not take it a step further than just devices?  This is a perfect
model for supporting named forks.
In fact, I believe this is how MacOS X is exposing HFS+ named forks to
the UNIX side of things.  (HFS+ supports not just the old style
Macintosh data and resource forks but an arbitrary number of named
forks.)  So: you open "foo", you get what an older MacOS would consider
the "data" fork.  Open "foo/rsrc" and you get the resource fork.  Open
"foo/joesfork" and you get whatever Joe wanted to use a named fork for.
