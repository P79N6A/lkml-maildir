Clarification:
I think the latency of my earlier email introduced by probably netdev is
creating a lot of "hostile" responses to me ;-> I feel like i am in
hostile path here ;->
I sent that email a long time ago, seems like netdev or my ISP decided
to deliver it now and reordered the delivery. This has happened to me a 
few times before with netdev thats why i prefer to cc people whenever i
can (worst case they receive more than one message)
Consider that message obsolete. I know you can create this problem via
brute force as you explained in your later email (that showed up
yesterday).
cheers,
jamal
