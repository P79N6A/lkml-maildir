Hello!
> Well, this is a deficit of the Linux kernel - not libscg.
This is exactly what I have written -- extra effort is needed to get
a stable numbering (which Solaris does), but you can use a very similar
extra care to get stable names (which Linux with udev does).
So I really se no advantage in preferring the numeric addresses over
device names, while device names have the obvious advantage of working
for all devices, not only SCSI.
				Have a nice fortnight
