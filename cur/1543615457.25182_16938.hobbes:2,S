Sockfs - yes, you'll see my patch already does it correctly, I was getting
a little tired when writing the previous reply... rd_load_image in 2.4.17 is
still using kdev_t there, however, no super_block anywhere to be seen.  I'll
track that change if it happens before I bring the patches forward to 2.5.
