Let's stick with that for now.
What about on the resume side?  Do you want to prevent child
registrations until after end_sleep has run?  Or would you be okay with
allowing the resume method to register new children?  It should be safe
to assume that drivers are smart enough to bring the device back to
full power before looking for new children.
In fact, maybe we don't need an end_sleep method at all.  There isn't
any synchronization issue to worry about -- drivers aren't going to
register their new children in a suspended state!

Because I didn't think of it.  :-)

That's reasonable.  If a driver doesn't support PM then it won't have 
a pm_ops pointer.

Yeah, I'm just trying to think too far ahead.
