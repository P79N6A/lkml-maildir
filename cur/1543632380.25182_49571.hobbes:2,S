Remember that we don't need swapper_space at all?
All the underlying inodes have their own address spaces, and the
SWP_ENTRY tells us what we need to know, to find the underlying address
spaces.
swapper_space is just a master address space that overlays the
underlying multiple address spaces.  We can just look directly at the
underlying ones...
