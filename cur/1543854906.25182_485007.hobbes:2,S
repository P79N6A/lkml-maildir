Fine, provided there's also a shell tool that can enquire whether the
kernel is sync'd or not.  (Currently the 11-minute update does not
occur when the kernel is desynced from a time source - the RTC itself
might be more accurate in this case.)
Throwing hwclock commands into crontab such that they do not take
note of the kernel's sync status is probably a very bad move in that
respect.
