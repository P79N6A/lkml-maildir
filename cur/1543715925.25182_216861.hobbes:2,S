So your mouse pretty much can work with any protocol... Now could you please
re-load the module without any parameters and post the output of
"cat /proc/bus/input/devices"
Also compile evbug module, insert it in the kernel (with psmouse loaded as
well), hit all buttons again and post the excerpt of dmesg with evbug data.
I want to make sure that your button is not identified correctly as opposed
to some data lost in protocol transformation.
What protocol are you using in XFree?
