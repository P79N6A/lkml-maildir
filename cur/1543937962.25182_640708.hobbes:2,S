Wouldn't it have been easier then to just extend the sleep profiler to
oprofile? oprofile already has pid filters and can do per process 
profiling.
On the other hand I'm not fully sure only doing per pid profiling
is that useful. After all often latencies come from asynchronous
threads (like kblockd). So a system level view is probably better
anyways.
