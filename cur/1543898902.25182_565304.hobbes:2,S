I could, but it would not solve the general problem.  Namely, that the
presence of fuse imposes a certain ordering in which userspace tasks
have to be frozen.  And it is not possible to know this ordering.
And even if the ordering were solved, the freezer would still not work
if the filesystem is not responding due to external events, such as a
lost network (this affects NFS, CIFS, whatever just the same as fuse).

I cannot say without having a sysrq-t of the situation.

I'd rather say, reliable suspend to ram is impossible in the presense
of userspace filesystems, iff people are too lazy to fix the suspend
framework and the drivers to work without the freezer.
This has nothing to do with unix, if plan9 would need to support STR
or hibernate, it would face exactly the same problems.
