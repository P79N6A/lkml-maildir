My kobject has a name, kobject_set_name(&fork_kobj, "fork_kobj"), and no
parent so I thought that the path returned by kobject_get_path() was
"/fork_kobj" even if the kobject is not registered with sysfs. As
send_uevent() function needs an object path, I used the
kobject_get_path() routine.

 I'm using kobject because it allows to notify user space application by
sending an event and as I need to send a kernel event (fork event) to a
user space application I thought about kobject. Do you think that it's
not the good solution because it's a too big mechanism for what I want
to do?
 I haven't looked at the "connector" code and I will have a look now.
Thank you very much to point this. 
Thank you for your comments and your help,

Guillaume
