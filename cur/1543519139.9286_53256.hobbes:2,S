The patches below work for me in 2.3.{30,31}.  I can use the kernel both
with an initrd in a rescue floppy, and without for normal booting.
I separate the ramdisk patch here because someone else is supposedly
preparing a better fix, although I haven't seen anything recently.
Some comments:
I haven't totally removed the "collision" test from main.c, as I don't
understand why it was ever there.  By its nature, initrd is an
architecture-related feature, and this test should be elsewhere (note
the code in setup.c).  In addition, it is unclear why the kernel doesn't
simply panic if this test fails, as it is quite unlikely that anything
useful can be done without the initrd.
I would guess that booting failure of initrd-enabled kernels without any
initrd is in calling reserve_bootmem() with a zero-length area.  In any
case, if you don't have an initrd, there is no reason to call it.
I am not satisfied with the BUG() call in the rd.c logic, although it is
not clear what should be done, as there is typically no fallback possible
when running with ramdisk.
