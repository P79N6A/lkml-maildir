If there is a capability that says "I can have any capability I ask for",
then it could work this way.  However, assuming that something like this
would be a bad idea, it could be modified by having the kernel give
/bin/caps, or whatever you've put into /proc/sys/kernel/caps, all
capabilities when it is exec'd.  /bin/caps could then drop the ones the
resulting process shouldn't have before exec'ing it.

One problem I see with this is that the fork()'d processes become children
of the daemon, not of the calling process.  This could be vaguely
simulated, for most purposes of wait() and kill(), but it would be really
hairy.

Checksums or timestamps or something could be kept in the conf files if
you're paranoid, but I can see an argument that if you've given
capabilities to a binary that untrusted users can play with, that's what
you wanted to do, and the kernel shouldn't assume that it's smarter than
you.

Under this system, a user can only grant capabilities that they have.  If
they grant their capabilities to a program that users they don't trust can
muck with, that would seem to be policy again, and userspace can enforce a
policy that forbids this, by /bin/caps checking the timestamps and
checksums and so on before exec'ing the program.
On the other hand, if there is a second user with root-like filesystem
capabilies, and no others, then they would be able to get any capabilities
that the first user had and gave to the executable.  I don't know if it
makes sense to protect against this, though, because this root-like user
could modify, for example, the capabilities config files, and any other
config files stored on the filesystem, thereby obtaining any capability
anyway.  But any capabilities system that stores information on disk is
subject to this, because a user with root-like filesystem rights could
edit the raw device, anyway.

Huh?  All that needs to be done to existing programs is to create a
wrapper script around programs that want extra capabilities.
