It probably won't handle that.  I don't get along too well with shmem.
Can you to an anti-shmem bigot how MPOL_INTERLEAVE should work with
shmem segments mapped in diverse ways by different tasks in different
cpusets?  What would be the key attribute(s) of a proper solution?
Maybe if we keep it simple enough, I can avoid mucking it up too much
this time around.
