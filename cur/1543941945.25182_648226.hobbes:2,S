So we add a debug statement to detect a module init function which returns
positive non-zero values, which module init functions are not supposed to
do.
Fair enough.  But a) the printk could state that more clearly and b) there
should be a comment in the code so that a developer (at whom this patch is
targetted) can go in and find out exactly what he did wrong.
