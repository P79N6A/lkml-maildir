Yep. And on early Pentinums, the ones with the "f00f" bug, it
would lock the machine tighter than a witches crotch. Ooops,
not politically correct.... It would allow user-mode code
to halt the machine.
Here is code that just quietly returns to the runtime code
that called it:
char main[]={0x90, 0x90, 0xc3};
FYI, if the .data section was not executable, you couldn't do
this. You would have to use some __asm__ stuff to put it in
the .text section. But, this is an interesting example of
how you can create code that the compiler refuses to generate.
It's easier to use assembly, though.....
Cheers,
