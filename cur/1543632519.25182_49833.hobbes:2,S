Might be the diagram is wrong. Ok. But I know people like Compaq are 
already doing RAID-6.

Yeah? That's what the hardware RAID vendors all say, and I yet haven't 
seen one single test where Linux Software RAID can't beat hardware RAID. 
That is also after some testing I did on a high-end intel server at 
Compaq's lab in Oslo. How can RAID-6 be so much different?
