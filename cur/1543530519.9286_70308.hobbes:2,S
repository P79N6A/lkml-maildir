	I haven't read through this whole thread, so this may have been
suggested, but why not have a new signal "SIGNMEM".  Can't be caught but
can be ignored.  Default is to take the signal and terminate the program
that faulted.  If ignored, put process to sleep until the memory request
can be satisfied.  Then something like 'X' or apache could ignore, while
'gcc' would just die.
