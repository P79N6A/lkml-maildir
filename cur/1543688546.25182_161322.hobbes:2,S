Somehow I can never reproduce these xmms skips, even in mainline 
kernels. I had them for a few days with older versions of rhythmbox, but 
no longer. So it seems that some of this is definitely system dependent? 
For the record, I have an Athlon XP 2100+ (1700 MHz) and 1G of memory (a 
pretty medium line desktop system), not the multi-cpu multi-gigabyte-RAM 
systems some people around here do.
Are people getting skips on hardware that is faster than this?
Thanks,
Rahul
