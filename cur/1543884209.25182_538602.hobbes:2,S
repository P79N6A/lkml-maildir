well, leave it to me to reply too quickly, sorry.  i think we should
leave simple_prepare_write() the way it is, since it's a library
function itself.  the other two callsites in your patch are buffers,
which may themselves be smaller than a page so you would need a
special function for just those two uses, there's no other way to
avoid making two calls to flush_dcache_page().  if it's tremendously
important to you to eliminate open coding of these, maybe make a
'static int buffer_prepare_write()' or some such in fs/buffer.c
