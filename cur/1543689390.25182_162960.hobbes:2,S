So how should it work?  What basically all drivers to curretnly is
to have a unsigned long they get from pci_resource_start and pass it
to ioremap(), e.g. in tg3.c:
	unsigned long tg3reg_base, tg3reg_len;
	...
	tg3reg_base = pci_resource_start(pdev, 0);
	...
	tp->regs = (unsigned long) ioremap(tg3reg_base, tg3reg_len);
with the ppc4xx code you'd have to change the unsigned long to
a phys_addr_t to actually work with the high io addresses, which doesn't
exist on the other architectures.
Given that patch must make any sense (which I don't know as no one
even tried to explain it!) the pci code on ppc4xx doesn't actually use
the high bits of phys_addr_t.  But then this whole change to ioremap
doesn't make any sense and those arch-specific drivers should just use
a ioremap64 variant which seems to be present on ppc44x aswell..
