It isnt about features, its about clean maintainable code. netdump to me
doesnt mean no dump to disk option. In fact I'd rather like to be able
to insmod dump-foo.o. The correctness issues are hard but if the
dump-foo is standalone, resets the hardware and has an SHA integrity
check then it can be done (think of it as a post crash variant of the
trusted computing TCB verification problem)

Lots of interesting legal issues but yes you can do it sometimes (DMCA,
privacy, financial duties sometimes make it horribly complex). Even in
the case where you only dump the oops its still valuable.

Encrypting the dump with the new crypto lib in the kernel would be easy,
right now it doesnt. 
My disk dump concerns are purely those of correctness. That means
1.	After loading the module getting the block list for the dump target
2.	Resetting and scratch initializing the dump device
3.	Not relying on any code outside of the dump TCB that may have
been corrupted
4.	At dump time turning off all bus masters, doing the dump TCB
verification and then dumping
Most of the pieces already exist.
