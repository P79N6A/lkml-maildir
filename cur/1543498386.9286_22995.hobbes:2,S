Hello!
  This message just popped up on my console:
alloc_skb called nonatomically from interrupt 0000011c
This is Pentium-166, that works as router(IP and IPX) and little DB server.
angband:~# uname -a
Linux angband 2.3.5 #13 Fri Jun 4 17:57:00 MSD 1999 i586 unknown
gcc 2.7.2.3 compiled.
It has 3 ethernets (I use old driver for all of them):
