That's not a proper fix. The agp code in 2.4.21pre supports the KT400
only in AGP2.0 mode. When you put an AGP3.0 (x8) card in the slot,
the chipset configures itself into AGP3 mode, and registers change
meaning.

Very, very dated now. Many fixes have gone into the agp code since
2.5.64, on which that backport is based.
