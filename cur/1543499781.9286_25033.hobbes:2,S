Besides, whoever invented the myth that crlf line endings are a problem  
for unix tools?

Incidentally, HTTP has the exact same problem. Just because much software  
ignores the crlf requirement doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, you know.
*All* "real" Internet protocols use crlf line endings exclusively.
As for crlf on-disk in unix, well, I hear the big news transit servers,  
for example, do it that way.
Personally, I'd even keep dot escapes on-disk.
