Well.  We'll see.
linux-next is more than another-tree-to-test.  It is (or will be) a change
in our processes and culture.  For a start, subsystem maintainers can no
longer whack away at their own tree as if the rest of use don't exist. 
They now have to be more mindful of merge issues.
Secondly, linux-next is more accessible than -mm: more releases, more
stable, better tested by he-who-releases it, available via git:// etc.  It
should be very easy for developers to do their weekly "does linux-next
boot" test.
Plus, of course, people who complain about merge-window breakage only to
find that the breakage was already in linux-next except they didn't test it
will not have a leg to stand on.
I feared that linux-next wouldn't work: that Stephen would stomp off in
disgust at all the crap people send at him.  But in fact it seems to be
going very well from that POV.
I get the impression that we're seeing very little non-Stephen testing of
linux-next at this stage.  I hope we can ramp that up a bit, initially by
having core developers doing at least some basic sanity testing.
linux-next does little to address our two largest (IMO) problems:
inadequate review and inadequate response to bug and regression reports. 
But those problems are harder to fix..
