It does on architectures where smp_read_barrier_depends() expands into
something nontrivial.  Maybe that doesn't include any of the machines
you're interested in.

But RCU-style locking can't be used in situations where the reader may 
block.  So it's not possible to use it with blocking notifier chains.
