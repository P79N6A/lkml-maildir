Hi,
We are using P4 HT Processor, RealTech 8139 Network card, Redhat 9.0
Kernel version 2.4.20-8smp.
When the system is booting form uni processor mode, I am able to ping
other systems in the network. But when I boot in SMP mode I am not able
to ping remote systems and am able to self ping. What may be the
problem? Is there any hardware problem? Is there any OS problem? 
If any body knows about it please let me know.
Thanks and regards,
Srinivas G
