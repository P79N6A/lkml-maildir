Right, I don't have anything. Unless the original incomplete ADMA driver 
release from NVIDIA counts as documentation, lol.
And yes, I've CC'ed NVIDIA people about a few ADMA-related issues and 
been met with silence. It would be nice if they were as responsive about 
ADMA issues as I must say Kuan and Peer have been on the SWNCQ side of 
things..

They're not even equivalent interfaces in this case, in the proposed 
AHCI legacy mode patch these controllers are supported in the default 
SFF mode only, no ADMA or SWNCQ, so you don't get any NCQ support..
