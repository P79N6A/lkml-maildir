Subject: 2.2.0-pre* breaks UDB IDE - more info

2.1.129 is the last kernel I can compile on my UDB, and the IDE works fine.
2.1.130-132 have one or more problems that weren't easily fixed.
2.2.0-pre2 is the first 2.2.0-pre kernel I can compile, and the IDE
fails, locking things up as I mentioned before.  I am going to experiment
by trying to back down some patches, but nothing significant appears to
have changed in the IDE sections.  The alpha IRQ definitions may have
changed though.
