Can't complain about that ;)

You might find that it's simpler and faster to call
page_cache_sync_readahead() against sb->s_bdev->bd_inode->i_mapping.
Or maybe not - that requires a struct file_ra_state.  We _used_ to have a
nice simple read-some-stuff-into-pagecache function which didn't need an
ra_state but that seems to have disappeared in the various recent readahead
churn.  Oh well.
