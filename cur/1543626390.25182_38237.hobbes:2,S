	Linus seems to like to put that extra special effort into
his annual presentations.  I remember a couple years back when he
hit us with one from Finland (ok, several years back) that was just
a few SECONDS after midnight, his local time (GMT?).  It meant that
most of us here in the burbs (US) got caught before it was April 1,
our time.  It's that special touch that endears him to us and got him
threatened with bodily harm...  >;-/=/
	I don't recall that he ever did tell us if he sat up all night
hovering over the send key or if he lit off a cron (at) job to do his
dirty work...  With the proven reliability of his creation, I guess he
could have slept well that night and merely awoke to the havok he
triggered...
