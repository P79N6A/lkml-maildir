Hi!
I've been running some rather evil tests.
Recipe:
32Meg RAM
128Meg swap
2.2.3 kernel
run make -j and watch. Peak swap usage gets to 50Meg or so, then it
starts dying with vfork: out of memory. [Can someone reproduce these,
please?]
Does it mean we have problems with memory fragmentation? Do this
problems need to be solved in 2.2 series?
