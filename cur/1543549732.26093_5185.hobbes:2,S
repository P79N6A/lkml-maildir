i've done some experimentation, and to me it appears we overload the
queued signal limit of bash, or something like that? The Ctrl-C thing
definitely creates alot of signals. And the default limit for queued
signals [kernel/signal.c:max_queued_signals] is 1024 ...
so i think this is threading-unrelated, to me it (tentatively) looks like
to be a signal handling bug.
