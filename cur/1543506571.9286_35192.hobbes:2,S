Just be absolutely sure that you don't clog the disk IO
unintentionally with write-behind data.  You need to fdatasync() your
output file regularly to ensure that your latencies aren't going to be
hurt (badly!) when bdflush decides that it is time to batch your
updates out to disk.  
The way to get best streaming write performance here is to preallocate
the data in advance (NOT just ftruncate(), which extends the file but
doesn't allocate disk blocks --- do a real write() of NULLs to the
file in advance).  If you don't do that then you'll end up incurring
extra disk seeks when you f*sync(), as you need to update lots of
file metadata as a result of allocating new disk blocks.  If you keep
the fdatasync()s relatively infrequent (say, once every 500--1000ms)
then the overhead of not preallocating the blocks shouldn't be too bad.
