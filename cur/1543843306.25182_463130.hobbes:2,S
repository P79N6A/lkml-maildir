May be we can treat a guarantee as a soft guarantee. A soft
guarantee would imply that when a group needs its guaranteed resources, the
system makes its best effort to make it available.
In soft guarantees, resources not actively used by a group can be shared with
other groups.
Hard guarantees would probably require reserving the resource in advance and
sharing of the resources not used, with other groups, might not be possible.
