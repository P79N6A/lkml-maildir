Yes, since they aren't errors, they're warnings really.

No.  'make dep' goes and does dependancies on every single file in the
tree (except inside of arch/ where we only go into arch/$(ARCH)) so for
drivers which are specific to certain arches, you might get warnings for
files which don't exit on your $ARCH, but aren't selectible anyhow.
