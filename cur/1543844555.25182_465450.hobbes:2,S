?? this is weird: I'm sure I used "reply to all", I checked the copy 
  in my sent-mail folder, your address were in the "to:" field.

Well, it may be a Mandriva issue.
udev version was udev-098-3mdv2007.0 here, I upgraded to 
udev-098-6mdv2007.0: no more luck.
I noticed the following difference between 2.6.18-rc6-mm2 and 
2.6.18-rc7-mm1:
with 2.6.18-rc6-mm2:

> drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 sep 22 10:47 /sys/class/mem/kmem/

> lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    0 sep 22 10:47 subsystem -> ../../../class/mem/
> --w------- 1 root root    0 sep 22 10:41 uevent
and with 2.6.18-rc7-mm1:
> # ls -l /sys/class/mem/kmem
> lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Sep 22  2006 /sys/class/mem/kmem -> ../../devices/virtual/mem/kmem

There is an udev rule for kmem:
# grep kmem /etc/udev/rules.d/*
/etc/udev/rules.d/50-mdk.rules:KERNEL=="kmem", NAME="%k", MODE="0640"
This rule seems to be not triggered in rc7-mm1.
