Sense of urgency in this case just means for 2.6.25 which
is still a few weeks away.
Sorry for not being a perfect being. Yes I did test the patch, but
no my testing did not catch the problem unfortunately. But I'm grateful
that your review caught the problem.

Ok but will you push them to .25?

First I disagree on you describing my change as unclean. There is nothing
particularly unclean about it. It's basically back to the same
code as it was in .24 for this case.
I think fixing this regression is important for 2.6.25
and I didn't think intrusive changes to pageattr.c are a good idea anymore 
for .25 at this stage so I did a simple fix.
I chose to fix this in the simplest way I could think of by
more or less going back to the old .24 code just adapted 
for the new interfaces.
Now if you decide you want to push the big changes in #mm that
make cpa work generally for ioremaps to .25 that would probably[1] fix the 
regression too and I wouldn't complain too loudly about that. 
But at least I personally think a as simple as possible fix is better at 
this stage.
[1] I reserve judgement at this stage because I have not reviewed the latest
code there in detail yet.

I can send it against whatever tree contains the fixes going before
2.6.25 to Linus. Is that #mm now?  I thought it was git-x86#master
so far that I is why I sent it against mainline which is virtually
identical to git-x86#master in this area.
