I'm putting that off. Some of the timesources aren't granular enough to
be used, so I don't see an easy way to cleanly use time source delays
for some cases and loop delays for others. So I just plan to leave it as
an arch specific implementation for now.

Yep, that's on my list. I'm trying to keep to just cleaning up one thing
at a time, but since I've got to re-work the timer_tsc.c code anyway, I
figured I'd try to organize all the TSC related functions
(synchronization, cpufreq, get_cycles(), tsc_delay maybe?) into tsc.c.
This will simplify things if we ever get around to correctly fixing the
SMP systems w/ different speed cpus issue.

That's totally the plan, although I want to put the control into sysfs.
Load a module, and echo "acpi-pm" or whatever into the sysfs file. I
just left it out for the first pass so folks would focus on the core
timeofday and NTP code (I can keep wishing, right? :)
thanks
