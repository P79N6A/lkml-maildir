You need slower boxes :-)
Every time I enable it to try and diagnose a bug in the Fedora kernel
I get a flood of "hey what gives, everything got slow" emails.
That speaks louder than any numbers to me.
It could be less of an issue on modern CPUs than it used to be, but
it has been painful enough in the past that I've really only enabled
it when I've been desperately trying to chase something down.

Maybe, though that gives me the creeps a little for some reason.
