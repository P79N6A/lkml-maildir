I believe that pci_resource_start() should return physical address, not
bus one. It already happens on PReP.

No. You need PCI memory space address only for busmastering transfers.
And for PCI DMA there is specialized API... Currently all bus -> physical
mapping should be hidden in platform specific PCI code.

And ioremap() should take physical address, returning virtual one.
