Tinfoil hat responses indeed!  Ok, if those folks are really that
crazy, my suggestion then would be to do a "ifconfig -a > /dev/random"
before generating the UUID, and/or waiting until you just about to
send the first profile, and/or if you don't yet have a UUID,
generating it at that very moment.  The first will mix in the MAC
address into the random pool, which will help guarantee uniqueness,
and waiting until just before you send the result will mean it is much
more likely that the random pool will have collected some entropy from
user I/O, thus making the random UUID not only unique, but also
unpredictable.
