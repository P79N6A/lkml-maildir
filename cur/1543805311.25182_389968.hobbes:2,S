axboe@nelson:[.]r/src/linux-2.6-block.git $ size block/scsi_ioctl.o
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   2844     256       0    3100     c1c block/scsi_ioctl.o
And it's not everything that's duplicated, basically only the ioctl
parsing is. So either admit that there isn't a a lot of duplicated code,
or "take some time" and point me at it. Otherwise refrain from making
obviously false statements in the future.
