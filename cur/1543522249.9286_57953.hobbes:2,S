    I looked through the thread on linux-kernel (I can browse via the web,
but the entire thread isn't there yet, because the stuff below is a
non-sequitor in relation to what is there now).  Someone is going to have to
help me get caught up on the thread, as it will be hard for me to say
anything intelligent until I know what we are talking about :-).   Are we
really talking about something for 2.4, or has this thread evolved into
planning for 2.5?
    For what it is worth, those damned per-major tables are the major thing
that is keeping me from eliminating those compiled in SD_EXTRA_DEVS limits
that keep people from loading an arbitrary number of additional devices via
modules.  I was toying with the idea of essentially encapsulating access to
these tables behind some lightweight API functions that would use
appropriate locking so that these tables could be grown whenever needed.
Once all of the direct usages of the data structures is encapsulated, then
changing the underlying data structures to something more sane (instead of
tables indexed by major) would be a breeze, relatively speaking.
I wasn't planning on doing anything at all with this until 2.5, however.
