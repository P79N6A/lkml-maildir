Subject: [OT]: Need help with license (BSD vs. GPL)

I've ported the H-FSC packet scheduler from altq to Linux 2.6.
The original version was released unter a original BSD-style
license with advertising clause. I've now talked to the original
authors, they agreed to release a version without this clause.
Am I correct that the license is otherwise GPL-compatible ?
I don't want to harass them more than necessary ..
I've attached a copy of the license.
Thanks,
Patrick
