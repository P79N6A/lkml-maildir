If the promise controller is unable to function correctly with the VIA
vt82c686b what pci ide controllers are suggested with linux?   And
shouldn't the good-bad ide config disable dma on the promise controller
when used with this chipset or will hdparm in init scripts be required
and fixing the problem be done all in userspace. In which case maybe a
list of hardware conflicts should be included in the help for the
chipset to give some warning.
