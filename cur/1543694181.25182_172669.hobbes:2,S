1) Get the 4496 drivers from NVidia, use "--extract-only" to get the pieces out.
2) Surf over to 
http://www.minion.de/nvidia
 and pick up the patch.  Apply
it in the NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4496-pkg2/usr/src/nv directory. While booted
to -test7, 'cp Makefile.kbuild Makefile' and then 'make'.  
(I posted more detailed directions a while ago, they should be in the list archives)
It would certainly help if you were more specific about "get an error about
my screen and /dev/nvidia0".
