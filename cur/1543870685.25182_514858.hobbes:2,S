For threadlets, it might be. Now think about a task wanting to dispatch N 
parallel AIO requests as N independent syslets.
Think about this task having USEDFPU set, so the FPU context is dirty.
When it returns from async_exec, with one of the requests being become 
sleepy, it needs to have the same FPU context it had when it entered, 
otherwise it won't prolly be happy.
For the same reason a schedule() must preserve/sync the "prev" FPU 
context, to be reloaded at the next FPU fault.

See above ;)
