why do you think fairness is good, especially always good?
> Starvation free
even starvation is sometimes a good thing - there's a place for processes
that only use the CPU if it is otherwise idle.  that is, they are
deliberately starved all the rest of the time.

in an average sense?  also, under what circumstances does this actually
matter?  (please don't offer something like RT audio on an overloaded machine-
that's operator error, not something to design for.)
> Deterministic
not a bad thing, but how does this make itself apparent and of value 
to the user?  I think everyone is extremely comfortable with non-determinism
(stemming from networks, caches, interleaved workloads, etc)
> Better interactivity for the majority of cases.
how is this measured?  is this statement really just a reiteration of 
the latency claim?

nah, I think the fairness and latency claims are the real issues.
