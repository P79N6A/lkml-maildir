RPM is called kernel (suprise), it's on the first CD (logical).
Boot from CD into rescue mode, and than:
# chroot /mnt/sysimage (if not done for you by rescue)
# rpm -q -f /lib/modules/2.6.5-1.358
kernel-2.6.5-1.358
# uname -c
i686
# rpm -Uhv --force /mnt/cdrom/Fedora/RPMS/kernel-2.6.5-1.358.i686.rpm
