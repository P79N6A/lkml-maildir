OK, so this is for AHCI. What are the options for people whose
mainboards aren't blessed with AHCI, but use for instance VIA or older
Promise chips? Buy new hardware? Or wait until someone comes up with an
implementation?
Can this queueing be emulated by software (libata or the libata chipset
driver) or would such be mentioned in Jeff's list as "host-based
queueing"?
TIA,
