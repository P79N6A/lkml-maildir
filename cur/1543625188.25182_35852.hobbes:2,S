Hi.
Some two weeks ago I posted here a kernel bug report regarding
a screen corruption issue. You can find it here:
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0203.0/1577.html
As I didn't know if it's my hardware that is the cause of corruption,
searched over the Internet and found that Thomas Brehm is also
having the same problem, and he has the same motherboard as me
(MSI MS-6340M, VIA KM133 chipset - VT8365 north + VIA686B south bridge).
Short problem description: 2.4.17 kernel works fine, but any kernel
higher than this makes the screen corrupted in any text or VESA fb
mode. In standard text mode, the screen gets filled with vertical
lines. In vesafb mode, random horizontal lines appear on the screen.
However, I made up the 2.4.18 kernel to boot up properly by 
replacing the file
	./linux/arch/i386/pci-pc.c
with that from the 2.4.17 kernel. The kernel runs fine now.
So, what seems to make the screen corruption?
