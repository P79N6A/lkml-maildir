The Fujitsu guys have a nice summary of this:

Skip forward to page 8.
Dont blame the networking code just yet :) Notice how worse UP vs SMP
performance is on the P4 compared to the P3?
This brings up another point, is a single CPU with hyperthreading worth
it? As Rusty will tell you, you need to compare it with a UP kernel
since it avoids all the locking overhead. I suspect for a lot of cases
HT will be a loss (imagine your case, comparing UP and one CPU HT)
