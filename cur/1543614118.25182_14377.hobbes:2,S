OK, lets take a look at the code in memory.c, first at line 736:
static void vmtruncate_list(struct vm_area_struct *mpnt, unsigned long
offset)
{
        do {
                struct mm_struct *mm = mpnt->vm_mm;
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the line where the system oopses, so vmtruncate_list
is being called with mpnt==0x00000002
Time to take a step back and look in vmtruncate(), line 769:
        if (inode->i_mmap)
                vmtruncate_list(inode->i_mmap, offset);
        if (inode->i_mmap_shared)
                vmtruncate_list(inode->i_mmap_shared, offset);
This suggests that you have a single-bit error somewhere in RAM
and vmtruncate_list() simply should never have been called.
kind regards,
Rik
