The original problem I had, which prompted this patch, eventually was
resolved in other ways.  But I do think that a hw-recovered bit in SError
is not a good reason to reset everything.
Tejun suggested that we still want to know about such errors,
and eventually do something if they repeat often enough.
But doing a port/link reset every single time ?

That portion of the patch is still a very good idea.
