I don't care too. But when there were Solaris
I could use the laptop. Now I can't... :-(

It have an rj45 but it's the modem connection. The
ethernet connection is the aui port that needs a
tranciever. Since it seems that it's not easy to find
in Italy, I'm waiting for a friends that promised me
to find one of this for me.

I hope it will work... it's a good laptop and
I would like to use Linux on it ;-)

No, it was shipped to me with just an external SCSI floppy (!),
but it won't boot from the external SCSI interface, just from the
internal one. So attaching an external SCSI cdrom won't work.

I never seen it too. Another solution would be
of course to find something to attach the 2.5"
removable SCSI disk to a "normal" SCSI bus
in some way and install Linux on it

I think I bought this laptop from the same place...
I've got the 170mb pcmcia HD, the beautiful SCSI
floppy, the horrible trackball, the cellphone modem
(very useful to me) and the wonderful bag...

I don't know. It would be good to get at least
the modem and the ISDN TA to work. A laptop
with integrated ISDN TA, modem and SCSI
interface sounds well, and that's the reason I
bought this laptop for...
