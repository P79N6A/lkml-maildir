I've got this while trying to play an audio CD by cdplay.
hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: packet command error: error=0x54
ATAPI device hdc:
  Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
  Invalid command operation code -- (asc=0x20, ascq=0x00)
  The failed "Play Audio TrackIndex" packet command was:
  "48 00 00 00 01 01 00 0a 63 00 00 00 "
hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: packet command error: error=0x54
ATAPI device hdc:
  Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
  Invalid command operation code -- (asc=0x20, ascq=0x00)
  The failed "Play Audio TrackIndex" packet command was:
  "48 00 00 00 01 01 00 0a 01 00 00 00 "
cdplay: ioctl cdromplaytrkind
I can't play any CD under 2.2.17
2.2.17 bug or "Yet Another Bug Of S500/A" ? :-)
NOTE:
2.4.0-test9 works without problems.
