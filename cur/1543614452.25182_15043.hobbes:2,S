Hi
i could not help but notice in the kernel source
in both the ipv4/netfilter and ipv6/netfilter
dirs there are files the same name which can cause problems
under certin conditions like non-case sensitive file systems.
like
ipt_mark.c
ipt_MARK.c
ipt_tos.c
ipt_TOS.c
this does not cause a problem for me but i do
know people who it does cause a problem for
a small example is a smallish ext2 / filesystem
and the rest being a fat filesystem to that
it can be accessed from both windows and linux.
and there is not enough space on the ext2 to compile a kernel anymore.
anyone got any suggestions ?
thanks
    James
