This didn't really occur to me before for some reason. But yes, the MCFG 
table lists the buses to which each MMCONFIG region is applicable. If 
there are entire buses which MMCONFIG cannot access, it should not be 
indicating they are accessible via MMCONFIG in the ACPI MCFG table. If 
it is, then it's truly a BIOS bug.
Unless of course Linux isn't handling what the MCFG table is indicating 
properly. Then it's our bug. It would be good to verify this on one of 
the systems involved..
One of the things this patch (currently in -mm) does is dump out the 
segment and starting/ending buses for each MCFG configuration listed. 
The dmesg from this patch applied on such a system would tell you which 
is the case:
