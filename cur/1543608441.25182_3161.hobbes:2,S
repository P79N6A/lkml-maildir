Ok, this is hopefully the last 2.4.14 pre-kernel, and per popular demand I
hope to avoid any major changes between "last pre" and final. So give it a
whirl, and don't whine if the final doesn't act in a way you like it to.
Special thanks to Andrea - we spent too much time tracking down a subtle
sigsegv problem, but we got it in the end.
Also, I was able to reproduce the total lack of interactivity that the
google people complained about, and while I didn't run the google tests
themselves, at least the load I had is fixed.
But most of the changes are actually trying to catch up with some of the
emails that I ignored while working on the VM issues. I hope the VM is
good to go, along with a real 2.4.14.
