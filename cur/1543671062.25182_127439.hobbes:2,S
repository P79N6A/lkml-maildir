I think most people doesn't interest wheter the code is simple or not...it must work!
What I like to see is that we can define in /etc/fstab an entry for a separate suspend partition or suspend file.
eg. for a partition:
/dev/sda4	none	swsusp	swsp	0 0
or for a file:
/tmp/swsusp	none	swsusp	swsp	0 0
Is it possible? It's also just an idea...

Also I wouldn't like it, if my programs get OOM-killed just because swap and memory are full! The reasons because I use standby and hybernation are:
1. I hate booting...(If I like booting I would use windows;-))
2. I want to continue working on the last work without opening the programs again
3. I can go home faster:-)
