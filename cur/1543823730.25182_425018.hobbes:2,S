This system will have no P-states and no deep C-states,
so the thing to watch is the idle/busy time.  It may be
that something in the patch you applied is keeping the
processor busy 100% and not allowing it to get into
idle (disk wait time that you'll see when building
that kernel counts as idle here) where it can save some power.
