Hi everyone.
A couple of questions about shm filesystem:
- Time ago I remember you could see some dot files inside the /dev/shm
  filesystem (then, even it was mounted in /var/shm...). No it shows nothing.
  Is it the supposed behaviour ?
- By accident (switching between 2.2 and 2.4), i left the shm fs 'commented'
  (with a fs type of 'ignore'). Kernel 2.4 looked working good. What is
  /dev/shm for exactly ? Because it looks like I can live without it...
TIA
