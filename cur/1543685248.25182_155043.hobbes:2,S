I've had corruption caused by hardware, and nothing else.  I haven't run
into any serious bugs.
But with servers, the larger your filesystem, the longer it will take to
fsck.  And that is bad for uptime.  Period.
I would be running ext2 also if I wasn't running so many test kernels (and
they do oops on you), and I've been glad that I didn't have to fsck every
time I oopsed (though I do every once in a while, just to make sure).
