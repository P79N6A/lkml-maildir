Ok - thank you for educating me on this.
So the byte order for 64 bit big endian cpumasks is:
  7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 23 22 ...
rather than the little endian byte order of:
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ...
I suspect that you are right, that I need a macro to pick the 'other'
half of a long, as you suggested:
  #define BITMAP_WORD(p, n)	(((u32 *)(p))[(n) ^ 1])
This would be defined in the include/asm-sparc64/cpumask.h and
include/asm-ppc64/cpumask.h files, with a no-op default in the
include/asm-generic/cpumask.h file for other architectures that
don't need it.  It would be used in lib/mask.c when printing
and scanning cpumasks.
I'm technically on vacation this week - If it doesn't cause anyone
heartburn, I likely won't get this patch out until mid next week.
If that hurts, squawk, and I'll work harder ;).
