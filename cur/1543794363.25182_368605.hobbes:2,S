That's interesting. Both Bradley and me are using ipw2200, an in the
madwifi thread, one person also mentions he is using this driver. I
don't know if madwifi and ipw2200 use common or very similar code. But
perhaps this problem really is caused by a combination of laptop
mode / disk spinup and certain wireless drivers?
As far as I remember all corruptions I observed happened while being
connected to wireless lan. But that alone never triggered the bug, I had
to enable laptop mode as well.
Unfortunately, I still have to find a way to reliably trigger the
problem. None of my test scripts which try to trigger disk activity
while the drive is spun down caused any corruption yet.
