but there *were* days when eth0 was eth0, if the kernel reports it as such.
now there is no eth0 at all. if I see an "eth0" from dmesg, I expect
it to be present.
Instead, udev remembers the old MAC address in 
    /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
which contains the old MAC adresses, too.
of course, that's problem with gentoo, not with the kernel.
Now I know why I never trusted udev much :-/
thanks,
