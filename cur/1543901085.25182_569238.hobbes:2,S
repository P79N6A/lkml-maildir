Actually, it is reported as unknown in a deeper probing level than
PCI. I once made a patch that among other thing identified that 
A-BIT board exactly. 
    
http://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2007-April/000441.html
It is possible to take this patch, drop the other bits and just
leave out the nice print that just tells it's A-BIT AW9D-MAX.
Though AFAIK, ALSA maintainers have plans to move most of the 
probing code to userspace somehow so I'm not sure if it is 
quite relevant.
