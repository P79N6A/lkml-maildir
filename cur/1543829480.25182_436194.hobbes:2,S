If I understand it well, an application which maps address 0 has no way to
be notified that the kernel detected a corrupted stack pointer. I agree
that if the proposed patch avoids to make this undesired distinction between
apps that map addr 0 and those which don't, it would be better to merge it.
Andi, you said there was nothing wrong with it, do you accept that it gets
merged ?
