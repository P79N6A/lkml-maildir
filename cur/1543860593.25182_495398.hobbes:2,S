It's still a heuristic, I don't think the kernel should be
doing things like this; leave the guesswork to userland,
where different users can guess in different ways if they
want/need.
Some real life properties contain _both_ a binary part and
a text part, btw.

Heh.  There is one big problem: text representation is useless
(to scripts etc.) unless it can be transformed back to binary;
i.e., it has to be possible to reliably detect _how_ some
property is represented into text, something that cannot be
done with how openpromfs handles it.
