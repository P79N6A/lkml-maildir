Hi,
http://www.avnet.co.uk/~ely/bfs-2.3.22c.patch.gz
This time I did have to modify the base kernel - I slightly enhanced teh 
fs_index() (fs/super.c) to accept the second argument indicating that 
char * __name points to kernel space vs user space. I also removed 
"static" and exported it. (this will be needed in ABI anyway, so we might 
as well do it now). So the statfs method of BFS correctly sets the fsid 
now.
Other minor cleanups here and there. The write support is not complete 
yet but readonly is as stable as before :)
Regards,
Tigran.
