Hi,
I have a DVD (IDE, using ide-scsi) with read errors, and when reading it
(UDF-mounted or directly with xine) on the read error the drive clicks,
I have an error in the log and, after a while, the kernel hangs.
Here is the (hand-copied) log:
scsi0:  ERROR on channel 0, id 1, lun 0, CDB: Request Sense 00 00 00 40 00
Info fld=0x1f6fa0, Current sd0b:00: sense key Medium Error
Additional sense indicates Unrecovered read error
 I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 8240768
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 0, scsi 0, channel 0, id 1, lun 0 Read (10) 00 00 1f 6f a2 00 00 06 00
Any hint to make this non-fatal ?
Xav
