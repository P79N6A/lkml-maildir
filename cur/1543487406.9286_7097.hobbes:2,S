The only valid way to get IP addresses is ioctl(SIOCGIFCONF).
/proc/net/dev lists available hardware, rather than IP addresses.

Please, explain. Only :-less down downs the interface. I cannot reproduce
the phenomenon. You sample with lo:1 does not down lo, certainly.
Well, I am puzzled... Is it possible, that nettools-1.50 strips suffix :1
itself???

To all that I know diald does not require patching and works equally
in 2.0 and 2.2. Well, try 
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/diald-0.16.5-flb.tar.gz
It DOES work and it does not contain any fixes, specific to 2.2,
only some generic buglets.

No new problems.
Pure gated-3.5.10 does not work with aliases both for 2.0 and for 2.2.
I hope, 3.5.11 will work. Stock gated-3.5.9 can be used both for 2.0 and 2.2,
for 2.2 patch 
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/gated-3.5.10-
*.dif.gz
is also available.
