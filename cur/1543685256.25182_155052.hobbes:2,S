Subject: suspend fails under load

Under kernel 2.6.0-test2 I get the behaviour that when trying to suspend
under load, I get all the way to the black screen, after which I am
supposed to see the writing pages to disk message.
Instead I see an error message flashing by to fast to read and
everything wakes up, although only part way.
I can switch consoles, but the keyboard doesn't type anything to screen,
and if I switch to X everything locks up.
If I suspend with less applications running, everything works fine.
A sufficient load to cause the problem is running X (with gnome),
evolution, matlab and gnome-multi-terminal.
Could find any error logs under /var/log.
Under 2.4 and the swsusp patch the kernel does suspend with those
problems.
Any idea how to proceed in locating the problem?
