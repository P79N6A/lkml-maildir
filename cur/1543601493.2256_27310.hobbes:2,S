I guess I'll postpone the likely/unlikely after resynching with Linus
since I'm basically ready to run rsync and I prefer to go sleep early
today and to think about new things tomorrow ;).
I also have a few arguments about the likely/unlikely to solve before
agreeing on it, in particular in all my usages the value will be either
0 or 1 so I don't see why should I tell gcc to do !!, probably it will
be optimized away but I also don't see why should the left term matter
for an "if", the "if" only cares about zero or non zero, so I should be
able to define the fast path with an 1 even if my result is 2, otherwise
it sounds like gcc is doing something strange.

thanks.

Yes, I pretty much agree on such change, I remeber you just pointed out
once. It's postponed to tomorrow too ;).
At the moment I just care to post the vm fixes against pre11 plain in
order to possibly get some feedback on it while I sleep :)

ok.
