You could equally say "bash compiles faster on Linux than XFree86 on BSD"
Meaningful benchmarking is quite an art. The Hint values themselves Im sure
are good benchmark info for some things. The 'it compiles at a different speed'
benchmark is not unless you use the same compilers headers, linkers and final
target
