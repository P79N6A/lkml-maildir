Peter,
David Goebel and I have been discussing writing a "universal" interface that
will allow linux file systems and NT filesystems to be used interchangably
between the two platforms.  The benfits to Windows NT are obvious, and David
is already looking at putting together an interface that will allow Linux
filesystems to be loaded under Windows NT.  We are probably about 85% of the
way there to have this for Windows NT.  Going the other way, and being able
to load Windows NT File systems on Linux is much harder -- particularly
since the GNU compiler doesn't support the NT syle of structured exception
handling, which is what's required to actually do this on Linux.  Also, many
of the problems with the NTFS "clone" on Linux are due to a general lack of
understanding of the way the log file functions in NTFS, and the semantics
of structured exception handling that are missing in the Linux world.  Based
on our agreements with MS, neither David or I can help the NTFS project on
Linux -- MS would get very pissed.  But we can work in other areas that may
be beneficial for both platforms moving forward.  An unchanging "universal"
file system interface would be very hot in Linux.
Stuff for future development.
Jeff
