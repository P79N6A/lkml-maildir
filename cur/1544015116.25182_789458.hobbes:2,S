The kernel has used:
# define inline         inline          __attribute__((always_inline))
For a looong time.
So anyone in the kernel when they said "inline" actually
said to gcc: if you have any possible way to do so inline this
sucker.
Now we have a config option that changes this so inline is only
a hint. gcc does not pay enough attention to the hint,
especially compared to the days where the hint was actually a command.
