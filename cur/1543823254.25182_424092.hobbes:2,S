btw, I'm thinking it would be sensible to convert the MAINTAINERS file into the
form:
P: Vivek Goyal <vgoyal@in.ibm.com>
P: Haren Myneni <hbabu@us.ibm.com>
And remove the "M:" lines.
This is more compact, saner for pasting into email clients, saner for
pasting into patch changelogs and would save me, oh, 45 seconds per day.
Is there any reason not to do this?  Such as tools which are parsing the
current format?
