Hm?  I don't know where you're getting that from.  Let's talk numbers.
Of the 60525 lines in .c files in arch/i386, 460 are longer than 80 cols.
Of the 67398 lines in .c files in arch/ia64, 1189 are longer than 80 cols.
Of the 496510 lines in .c files in drivers/net, 4044 are longer than 80 cols.
So arch/i386 has 0.76% > 80 column lines, drivers/net is 0.81% and
arch/ia64 is 1.76%.  Seems fairly convincing to me that ia64 is out of
step with the rest of Linux.

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
