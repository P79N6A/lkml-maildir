It's not a suggestion, the current code already does this:
/*
 * ext2_delete_entry deletes a directory entry by merging it with the
 * previous entry. Page is up-to-date. Releases the page.
 */
...
        if (pde)
                pde->rec_len = cpu_to_le16(to-from);
As it happens, the first entry tends to be '.'.

Doesn't matter, reclen still makes it a linked list, and we'd still skip
over 'dead' entries, regardless of content.
