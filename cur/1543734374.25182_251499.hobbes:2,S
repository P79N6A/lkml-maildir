Indeed, Linus also pointed out how lax the documentation on usage and 
effects of these opcodes.

The suggested usage of monitor/mwait avoids that scenario, the recommended 
usage being;
while (*addr != condition) {
	monitor(addr)
	if (*addr != condition)
		mwait();
}
This method is used because you can receive spurious wakeups from mwait. 
Like 'hlt' an interrupt, NMI, SMI etc will cause the processor to continue 
executing the next instruction after mwait. The extended sleep state 
however could occur if interrupts are disabled which isn't the case with 
the current users. So there is a sense of time deterministic behaviour 
with an operating system which uses a periodic timer tick for example. But 
regardless of that, i also think this requires further clarification with 
respect to side effects and benchmarking with current hardware.
Thanks,
