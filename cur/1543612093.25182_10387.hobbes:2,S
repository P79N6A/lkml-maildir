init() calls do_basic_setup(), which calls do_initcalls(),
which calls all module_init() functions for "modules"
that are built into the kernel, including scsi_init() if
SCSI is built into the kernel (instead of being a loadable
module).

Yes, there are some (other) device_setup() functions: pcmcia serial
and wanrouter, but not in scsi.

Above, except omitting "scsi_dev_init".

scsi_dev_init() doesn't seem to exist (in 2.4.16).
scsi_init() is in linux/drivers/scsi/scsi.c .
