Hi all,
	Andrew Clayton reported lockups on the dri list issues since -bk2
and bug 4337 on bugzilla.kernel.org looks like it might be the same
thing..
This leads me to think the AGP multi-bridge patches are at fault... (for
once my laziness in merging late instead of early gave a good gap in the
patches...)
I'm "offline" in sense of I can write this mail and respond but have not
access to a Linux system, my bitkeeper trees, ssh keys for anywhere of
interest.. and am in the wrong country, it'll be the 23rd/24th before I am
back at my desks...
I might get time to do a code review, my main worry is that all the
problems reported with those patches in -mm made it into the patchset that
went into Linus.. mainly things like forgetting to memset certain
structures to 0 and sillies like that...
Dave.
