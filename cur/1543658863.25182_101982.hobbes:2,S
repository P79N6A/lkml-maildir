Say, I've been having _smashing_ success with 2.5.x on the desktop and
on big fat highmem umpteen-way SMP (NUMA even!) boxen, and I was
wondering if you were considering 2.6.0-test* anytime soon.
I'd love to get this stuff out for users to hammer on ASAP, and things
are looking really good AFAICT.
Any specific concerns/issues/wishlist items you want taken care of
before doing it or is it a "generalized comfort level" kind of thing?
Let me know, I'd be much obliged for specific directions to move in.
Thanks,
Bill
