no this is wrong by virtue of having TASKSTATS_TYPE_AGGR twice.
Again invoke the rule i cited earlier.
What you could do instead is a second AGGR; and your nesting would be:
TASKSTATS_TYPE_AGGR1 <--- nest start with this type
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_PID <-- NLA_U32_PUT
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_STATS <-- NAL_PUT_TYPE
                     <-- nest end of TASKSTATS_TYPE_AGGR1
TASKSTATS_TYPE_AGGR2 <--- nest start with this type
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_TGID <-- NLA_U32_PUT
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_STATS <-- NAL_PUT_TYPE
                       <-- nest end of TASKSTATS_TYPE_AGGR2

The advantage being you dont introduce another T.

So you would distinguish the two as have something like:
TASKSTATS_TYPE_PID
   u32 pid
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_STATS
TASKSTATS_TYPE_TGID
   u32 tgid
   TASKSTATS_TYPE_STATS
or
TASKSTATS_TYPE_PID
   u32 pid
TASKSTATS_TYPE_TGID
   u32 tgid
both should be fine. The difference between the two is the length in the
second case will be 4 and in the other case will be larger. 
But come to think of it, this will introduce unneeded semantics; you
have very few items to do, so forget it. Go with scheme #1 but change
the names to TASKSTATS_TYPE_AGGR_PID and TASKSTATS_TYPE_AGGR_TGID.
