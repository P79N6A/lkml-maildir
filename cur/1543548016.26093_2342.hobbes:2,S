It makes a difference, see below.

I wrote the above not just as a complete testecase, but just to mean what
the case I was talking about. You made int a a local variable and the
thing you noticed is an otimization that the compiler is allowed to do
regardless of the "memory" clobber too (`int a' have to be at least extern
otherwise the compiler understands the first read can go away). Try this:
int * p;
int a;
extern f(int);
main()
{
	a = *p;
	
	__asm__ __volatile__("zzz" : : );
	a = *p;
	f(a);
}
Try to add "memory" as clobber to the above testcase and nothing will
change. (that's what I meant in my previous email saying that even w/o
"memory" things got compiled right at least in my simple testcases)
>Again, __volatile__ makes no difference.
Note that __volatile__ really makes a difference if for example you
speficy as output an operand that isn't used anymore.
Try this:
main()
{
	int a;
	__asm__("zzz" : "=r" (a));
}
and then this:
main()
{
	int a;
	__asm__ __volatile__("zzz" : "=r" (a));
}

The behaviour of what you described is definitely correct/safe.
My only wondering was about "memory" non-"memory" as clobber because gcc
was doing things right just with the __asm__ __volatile__ thing w/o
"memory" as clobber. However I had the confirm my worries was right and
that "memory" is needed for all the spinlocks.
BTW, we had a bug in the alpha port last month in the
linux/include/asm-alpha/fpu.h:wrfpcr() function, read it for a real world
example of where __volatile__ must be used.
