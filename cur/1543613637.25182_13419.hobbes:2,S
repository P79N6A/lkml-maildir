Hi,
As I tested 2.4.17-rc1, I think the OOM is still not
right working, In a session StarOffice got killed when
there is still a lot memory available. But strange
enough, 2.4.16 seems to be better in the same
situation. Another issue; because after that I restart
staroffice and mount floppy ; read a file from floppy,
because of a bug in Star office (I think ) when I save
file to the floppy from star office, star office hang,
no responsive at all. I have to kill staroffice but it
doesn't work, even I use signal 9. Then I try to
repeat this under 2.4.16, it did not happen (kill
works)
Regards,
