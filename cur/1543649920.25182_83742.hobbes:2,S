Well, actually the main point is to get the CONFIG_TINY symbol into 
mainline, even if it doesn't do much at first.  That in itself will
be enough to inspire various artists to contribute their own
creative minimalizing hacks to the subsystems in which they have
specific expertise.
I'll bet you beer that some of the minimized subsystems eventually
supplant their more bloated brethren, as superior in every way.
