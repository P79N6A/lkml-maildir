Subject: neither 2.2.18 nor 2.4.0 boot on my Cyrix III

I'm not subscribed to the list but I want to report this problem:
I found this in the kernel mailing list archive :

I had the same problem as described above with 2.2.18 and 2.4.0 
(2.2.17 boots without any problems)
I changed setup.c as suggested in this post and was able to boot both
(2.2.18 and 2.4.0).
I don't have any kernel knowledge but I'm willing to test something on
my box if 
anyone is interested in solving this problem.
(via Cyrix III on a Aopen mx3s board (i815))
TIA
