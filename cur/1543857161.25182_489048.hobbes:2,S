there are a plethora of headers that cannot be included straight due
to the usage of __ types (like __u32) without first including
linux/types.h ... so the question is, should all of these headers be
fixed to properly pull in linux/types.h first or are users expected to
"just know" the correct order of headers ?  in my mind, pretty much
every header is fair game for straight "#include <header>" usage and
requiring a list of headers to be pulled in properly is ignoring the
problem ...
