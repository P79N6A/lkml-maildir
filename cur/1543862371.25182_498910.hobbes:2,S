The plan is to have a single unified tree at /sys/devices, where all
device-directories live below their parents, and /sys/class contains
only symlinks pointing into this single tree, just like /sys/bus.
People want to stack class-devices, but this leads to a /sys/devices
tree and several small trees spread around in /sys/class. These trees
need to be connected by "device"-links and the "class:"-links, which
just doesn't make much sense if you can have one single tree with the
same information.
In the unified tree, the "device"-link will always just point to the
parent device, that's why there is a config option to disable these
links and test current software not to depend on it.
There was a long discussion on lkml about all that, maybe a year ago,
while converting "input".
Thanks,
Kay
