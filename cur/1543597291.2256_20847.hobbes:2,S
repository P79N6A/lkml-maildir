Have you checked if the requester is not satisfied with an increase 
of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog? If they "know" from 2.0
that they want a SOMAXCONN increase then that's very likely the case.
In 2.2+ SOMAXCONN only applies to established sockets waiting to get
accept()ed; and when you have 128 established sockets that don't get served
by accept you have a big problem.
SYN-RECV sockets are a completely different thing and they are tuned
by the first sysctl and some other heuristics in 2.4.
You can also turn on syncookies there to handle syn-recv load spikes.
