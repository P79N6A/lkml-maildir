  Agreed on the i8042 translation,  a few years ago I tested this in
embedded PC environments,  and every board I found allowed they keyboard
controller translation to be turned off.  This would increase the amount
of data sent (f0 prefix for down code if I remember correctly),  but
subsequent translation is a hell of a lot simpler.
  If by the keyboard switching,  you're referring to the scan set it
supplies (set1/set2/set3),  then there is a problem.  For some of the
keyboards I tested,  changing out of the normal set (set2 I think)
would crash the keyboard.  The only way to then recover was to power
cycle the keyboard.
