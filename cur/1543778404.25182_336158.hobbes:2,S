[PATCH -mm/-rc] fix xip sparse file handling in ext2
Oliver Paukstadt from our test department is testing the xip patches in
Linus' git-tree. He found a problem that shows when reading a file that
contains sparse blocks (holes) on a -o xip mounted ext2 filesystem: the
BUG_ON() in fs/ext2/xip.c:40 triggers where it should not. The problem
was introduced by a cleanup in my previous patch, this patch fixes it.
