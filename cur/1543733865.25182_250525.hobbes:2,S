 You need to append resume=/dev/your_swap_partition to kernel command
 line. Then you suspend by echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep.
 
-Pavel's unreliable guide to swsusp mess
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-There are currently two versions of swap suspend in the kernel, the old
-"Pavel's" version in kernel/power/swsusp.c and the new "Patrick's"
-version in kernel/power/pmdisk.c. They provide the same functionality;
-the old version looks ugly but was tested, while the new version looks
-nicer but did not receive so much testing. echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep
-calls the old version, echo disk > /sys/power/state calls the new one.
-
-[In the future, when the new version is stable enough, two things can
-happen:
-
-* the new version is moved into swsusp.c, and swsusp is renamed to swap
-  suspend (Pavel prefers this)
-
-* pmdisk is kept as is and swsusp.c is removed from the kernel]
