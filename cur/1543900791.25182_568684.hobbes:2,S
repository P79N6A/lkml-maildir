(lots of details, thanks).
I just tried it on 2.6.22-rc6-mm1 (just what I happen to be working
on) and it works fine.  I do have a vague memory of something like
this being fixed in the last several months.
So I suggest that you try a newer kernel.
It could be that commit 1757128438d41670ded8bc3bc735325cc07dc8f9
is the one that fixed this problem, but I cannot be sure.
