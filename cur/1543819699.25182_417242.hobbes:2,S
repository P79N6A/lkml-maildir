Ah, I have to correct the above - the mask filtering skips directory
traversal checking, so not every component I suppose.  Which is
interesting for another reason.  But performance situation still looks
fairly bad from a code POV, and the existing hooks still seem to be the
wrong place for this kind of processing/checking.
