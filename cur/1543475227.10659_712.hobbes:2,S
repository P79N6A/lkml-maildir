I have a computer that has 2 Intel EEPro100 Ethernet cards and an Adaptec
2940 SCSI controller on the PCI bus.  The bios unfortunately provides no
way to hard code the interupts on any of the devices, and procedes to
allocate them in the following fashion: [notice shared int 10]
 0:    5436677   timer
 1:       2259   keyboard
 2:          0   cascade
 8:          1 + rtc
 9:      68461   Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 Ethernet
10:     118827   aic7xxx, Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 Ethernet
12:      34267   PS/2 Mouse
13:          1   math error
15:          0 + ide1
This output was produced under 2.0.36.  I have been unable to get the
machine to boot under 2.2pre4.  I have tried having the EEPro/Adaptec
drivers in and out of modules.  This concerns me as 2.0.36 has no trouble
whatsoever using this configuration.  Here's some more config [once again 
under 2.0.36]:
/proc/pci:

Since I cannot get the machine to boot with the new kernel, I'm a little
unsure of where to proceed.  The machine is a PPro-200 with 192 MB RAM.
It is running a clean Redhat 5.2 with updates applied according to the
Changes guidelines.
I am more than happy to run any patches/tests needed.
thanks,
