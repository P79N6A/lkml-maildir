Agreed, I never knew which of the three values had which functionality.
For via686a this would be inX, inX_min, inX_max, tempX, tempX_overshoot 
(over = overshoot = os ?), tempX_hyst, and so on.

If we're restructuring it, I think we should also agree on _one_ common 
denominator for all values ie. mVolt and milli-Degree Celsius, so that 
no userspace program ever again has know how to convert them to 
user-readable values and every user can just cat the values and doesn't 
have to wonder if it's centi-Volt, milli-Volt, centi-Degree, dezi-Degree 
or whatever.
Thanks,
Jan
