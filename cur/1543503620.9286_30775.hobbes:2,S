What you forgot was that the partitions have less structures and or
therefore faster to fsck.  I believe that the fsck time increases faster
than linearly with the size of the disk.
I'm curious about this as well.  What advantages are there to multiple
partitions, besides faster fsck times?  How do I know what size to make
them?  How should I break the partitions up? What do I do if I run out of
space in one?
Ciao!
