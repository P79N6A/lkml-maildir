Hi there,
With ppp in 2.3.20, I am unable to browse any site. First I compiled ppp as a
module, but pppd would crib that there is no ppp support. So, I compiled it
into the kernel. Now, I am able to connect and download mails using
fetchmail, but I am unable to access any web site. 
Presently I am using the 2.2.12 kernel with ppp as a module and I don't have
any problem ( pppd 2.3.9 version ) Can anybody explain what the problem is
Any help would be appreciated.
TIA
Regards
	Avenger
