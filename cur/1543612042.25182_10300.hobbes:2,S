Then when you get your hands on code like this you have two bugs to fix:
1) The origional problem you wanted to code up
2) Fix the formatting.
I suggest (yes, more work) that you run the code through the code normalizer
for that project and then look at the code produced from that.
That way, you will be able to see the code blocks in a standard way.  As you
look at the formatted code, you can program in the old indentation format.
When you're done, you have two patches.  One with the origional fix, and
another with the formatting improvements.
You'll probably want to get a concensus of what the other developers in the
project have agreed upon before you submit the formatting patch.  Much the
way this thread may turn out...
