An example could be helpful in clarifying the GPL license.
Suppose I use the linux-vrf patch for the kernel that is freely
available and use the extended setsocket options such as SO_VRF in an
application, do I have to release my application under GPL since I am
using a facility in the kernel that a standard linux kernel does not
provide?
Suppose my LKM driver adds a extra header to all outgoing packets and
removes the extra header from the incoming packets, should this driver
be released under GPL.? In a way it extends the functionality of
linux, if I do release the driver code under GPL because this was
built with linux  in mind, Should I release the application  which
adds intelligence to interpret the extra header under GPL?
Thanks,
Pramod
