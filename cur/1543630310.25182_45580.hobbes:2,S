I installed kernel 2.4.19-pre8 in hopes of getting UDMA Working on my debian
installation, i still see some wierd errors fly by on the boot up, but i
can't figure out what they say :)  i tried to apt-get install hdparm but my
network connection disappeared, the ethernet card is still detected, but i
can't even ping my firewall, I see some DHCP Errors go by, i think one of
them mentions dhclient.pid but again, they go by too fast and I can't read
them... I compiled the right driver for my ethernet card so I don't know
what else i could have changed, If I boot the 2.2.20 kernel it works fine.
oh, and in 2.4.19-pre8 something is wrong with ioapic.c, the compilation
broke there. i just took it out of the kernle config and it worked fine.
