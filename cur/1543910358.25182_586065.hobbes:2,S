Looks like a bad sector in the swap partition.
You can probably repair it by using this sequence of commands:
swapoff /dev/sdX	<--- replace sdX with actual swap partition dev name
sync
cat /dev/zero > /dev/sdX
mkswap /dev/sdX
swapon /dev/sdX
If it recurs after doing that, then it's time for a new drive.
