I assume (hope!) there's already a higher-level linux lock serializing 
access to acpi_acquire_global_lock() although I've not delved deeply 
into the code. This is the lock described on p112 of 
http://www.acpi.info/DOWNLOADS/ACPIspec-2-0c.pdf,
 which has the 
semantics that if the OS wants to take the lock while the BIOS holds it, 
it sets a bit and waits for an interrupt from the BIOS. I don't see that 
it could be naturally implemented using a linux lock.
