One problem still remains: that of telling the driver which physical
device(s) it should control.  And, a related problem, telling this to an
already loaded driver (for hotplug &c).
It seems like we'll _have_ to introduce another initialization call to
hotplug capable drivers, to inform them of the actual hardware they're
controlling.  One idea I had about it was that such drivers won't connect
to the hardware in their `old-style' init function, but instead invoke
some registration function (e.g., register_pci_driver()) to tell the
system what hardware they support.  The bus drivers will then invoke
configuration calls on the driver and give it a list of pointers to
resource records which belong to its hardware.
BTW, with all this talk about hotplug and such, I haven't seen any
suggestions for solving the problem of persistently mapping the physical
hardware to logical device numbers; we need some way to have the system
allocate the same major/minor number to the same hardware whenever it's
used...  Any ideas?
