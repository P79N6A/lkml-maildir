Hi!
I (and other) had problems, that may be related to this. Can you look into it ?
What happened was :
linux boot had a delay of 10..30..90..infinite seconds, depending on command
line length and certain disk related BIOS settings.
GRUB was the loader. The delay went away after disabling CONFIG_EDD.
It was also "fixed" by downgrading the BIOS version.
It would be really cool if you could inject some wisdom in the issue ;-)
For details, see the LKML archives :
"EDD code causes long boot delay"
