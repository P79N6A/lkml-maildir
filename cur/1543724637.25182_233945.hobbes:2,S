Hi.
Thanks for those. Can you confirm which version of the preempt threshold 
patch you're using? The first one I posted unfortunately had false 
positives. Those results unfortunately look like the first patch.
You would have to be using either wli_preempttest2 + 2.1 separate patches or 
the snapshot-2.6.8-rc1-ck5-0407130047 or later which includes these patches 
for more accurate timekeeping (sorry).
Cheers,
Con
