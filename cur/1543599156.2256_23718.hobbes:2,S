Processes accessing stuff already in RAM aren't causing
any VM stress, since all the stuff they need is already
in RAM.
As for I/O already being done in big chunks, I'm not sure
if readahead would have any influence on this situation.

Actually, "suboptimal I/O" and "shuffling pages without getting
work done" are pretty similar.

I don't think we'd need to know the difference at all times.
After all, TCP manages fine without knowing the reason for
packet loss ;)
