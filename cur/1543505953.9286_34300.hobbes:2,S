I have successfully mounted a 216 Gb partition on 2.0.37. I can't tell you
about anything larger because I don't have the facilities. This one was a
raid5 stack. However, if I turned smp on in the kernel, the mounting was
unsuccessful for partitions as small as 100 Gb. Stuff like 20/30 Gb worked
fine for both the smp and non-smp 37 kernel. I am using 2.2.7 now and 216
Gb mounts without problems with smp.

Martin
