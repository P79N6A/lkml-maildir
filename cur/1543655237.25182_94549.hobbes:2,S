	It's pretty much impossible not to support consistent memory.
	I'd suggest a shorter name for code readability and particularly
to hint that this is the standard usage.  I'd suggest DMA_CONSISTENT
or "0".

	There is a pretty strong convention for medium to short names
in the kernel, although this name will be used much less, so its
length is not as important.  I'd like something that would match the
names of the corresponding cache flushing and invalidation functions.
I think I had previously suggested DMA_MAYBE_CONSISTENT and wmb_maybe
or dma_sync_maybe but I'm not that attached to the "maybe" word.

Why have a separate dma_alloc_consistent function?
