A couple more comments..

Can we just do BUG_ON(register_filesystem() != 0)?
Strictly speaking, the != 0 is redundant, but as this goes slightly
against the grain of normal usage, it's a good indicator of intent.

We can never return non-zero here. Returning error implies we can, so
it's confusing.
