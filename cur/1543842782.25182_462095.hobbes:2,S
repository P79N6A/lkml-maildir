Nope.  If the clump of pages has a mix of active and inactive, the above
design would cause the active ones to be deactivated, so now the entire
clump is eligible for treatment by shrink_inactive_list().

Maybe.  Careful benchmarking and carefully-designed microbenchmarks are, as
always, needed.
Bear in mind that simply moving the pages to the inactive list isn't enough
to get them reclaimed: we still do various forms of page aging and the
pages can still be preserved due to that.  IOW, we have several different
forms of page aging, one of which is LRU-ordering.  The above design
compromises just one of those aging steps.
I'd be more concerned about higher-order atomic allocations.  If this thing
is to work I suspect we'll need per-zone, per-order watermarks and kswapd
will need to maintain those.

Don't think in terms of "freeing".  Think in terms of "scanning".  A lot of
page reclaim's balancing tricks are cast in terms of pages-scanned,
slabs-scanned, etc.
