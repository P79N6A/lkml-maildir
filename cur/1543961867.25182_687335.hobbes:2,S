Ok, this clashed in some nasty ways in drivers/acpi/video.c due to the 
non-racy /proc file creation changes that came through Andrew. I fixed up 
the result, and it *looks* sane (and compiles), but I didn't actually test 
it, and I don't know the code well. Can you double-check.
There were some (smaller) rejects in drivers/misc/intel_menlow.c due to 
two different versions of the same patch from Julia Lawall (again, the 
other came through Andrew), and I picked the one from Andrew because it 
had the later date. But again, you should double-check.
