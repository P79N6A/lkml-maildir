Which proves my point: These facilities were not ment to be treated as
files.  They were designed with a specific need in mind.  When I read
posts the likes of Alex and Richard above (no offense, guys) it's like
your saying you don't like the Apple Pie that was baked yesterday.  Well,
if you don't like it, go bake a new one!  But stop saying the pie of
yesterday is old and moldy and should be thrown away when it tastes just
fine to the rest of us, thank you very much. (um.. sorry for the "pie"
analogy.  I'm hungry ;-)

Yes, you *could* shoe-horn the mechanism into a file architecture, but
(as was already stated above) it would be awkward and inappropriate to
use.  Don't ignore the history of Unix's design.  There's a reason for
everything.  AIX's select() allowed message queues because AIX already
implemented distributed message queues (back when AIX was only on the
PC/RT).  It's just no other OS supported it ;-)
Anyway, back to our pie, um err, "discussion" ;-)
