I'll do what I like, thank you.  I'll continue to use Linux, I think
it's a fine fit for the way *I* think.

You are now talking religion at this point.  Do you have a technical or
even experience based point to make?  
I have experience that has shown that providing too much information in
a production product can is confusing, harmful and costly when dealing
with consumers.  Your opinions won't change that.
I proposed a mechanism for keeping all the printk data and saving space
buy doing some table based compressions that has the side effect of
making the syslog not human readable.  You proposed a mechanism for
no-oping out complete log-levels.   
Which way hides more from the user?  No-oping the log-levels is the
easier to implement.

There is a time and place for many things.  Even error codes.
