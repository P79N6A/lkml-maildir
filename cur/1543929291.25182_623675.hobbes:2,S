If you have 10M packets/sec no amount of cycle-saving will help you.  
You need high level optimizations like TSO.  I'm not saying we should 
sacrifice cycles like there's no tomorrow, but the big wins are elsewhere.

True.  And here, the hardware can cut hundreds of cycles by avoiding the 
kernel completely for the fast path.

Your reflexes are *much* better than mine if you can measure half a 
nanosecond on X.
Here, it's scheduling that matters, avoiding large transfers, and 
avoiding ping-pongs, not some cycles on the unix domain socket.  You 
already paid 150 cycles or so by issuing the syscall and thousands for 
copying the data, 50 more won't be noticeable except in nanobenchmarks.

And again the key is batching, improving cpu affinity, and caching, not 
looking for a faster instruction sequence.

That is true.  But any self-respecting systems language will let you 
choose between direct and indirect calls.
If adding an indirect call allows you to avoid even 1% of I/O, you save 
much more than you lose, so again the high level optimizations win.
Nanooptimizations are fun (I do them myself, I admit) but that's not 
where performance as measured by the end user lies.
