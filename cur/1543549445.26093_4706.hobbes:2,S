There's another minor problem with using fd's as handles... Windows expects
the handle number to be a multiple of 4, and sometimes, probably only on rare
occasions, uses the bottom two bits to pass extra information. I was flicking
through the Native API reference last night, and came across a couple of
instances. I don't know whether this ever applies to Win32, though.
