Hi Andrew,
 could you please remove
knfsd-sunrpc-update-internal-api-separate-pmap-register-and-temp-sockets.patch
knfsd-sunrpc-allow-creating-an-rpc-service-without-registering-with-portmapper.patch
knfsd-sunrpc-cache-remote-peers-address-in-svc_sock.patch
knfsd-sunrpc-use-sockaddr_storage-to-store-address-in-svc_deferred_req.patch
knfsd-sunrpc-add-a-function-to-format-the-address-in-an-svc_rqst-for-printing.patch
 and 
#knfsd-sunrpc-provide-room-in-svc_rqst-for-larger-addresses.patch
#knfsd-sunrpc-make-rq_daddr-field-address-version-independent.patch
#knfsd-sunrpc-teach-svc_sendto-to-deal-with-ipv6-addresses.patch
#knfsd-sunrpc-add-a-generic-function-to-see-if-the-peer-uses-a-secure-port.patch
#knfsd-sunrpc-support-ipv6-addresses-in-svc_tcp_accept.patch
#knfsd-sunrpc-support-ipv6-addresses-in-rpc-servers-udp-receive-path.patch
#knfsd-sunrpc-fix-up-svc_create_socket-to-take-a-sockaddr-struct-length.patch
and include the following 14 patches instead?
They are mostly from Chuck Level and make preparating for IPv6 support
in the NFS server.
They are *not* for 2.6.20, but should be ok for .21.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
