Could I ask anyone with a USB Zip drive and a ps2 mouse to try
to confirm this bizarre bug for me?
To reproduce it should be simple:
1)  Compile USB support as modular, *not* compiled in.
2)  The USB Zip drive *must* be plugged in during boot.
     This bug won't show if you plug in the drive later.
3)  Reboot and see if your ps2 mouse works.
Thanks!
