??? Then you can not do any work done. There are quite a few things to be
done only by root-owned processes.

It's not possible at all so I can not understood what is duscussed here.

Yes. You can set limits from sshd with PAM if you wish (you have sshd with PAM
support, right :-) Kernel DOES NOT read configuration files. Never was,
never will. If you need such kernel - switch on other OS.

What you want ? Kernel do not have embedded thelepathy module. If you need
to force limits you SHOULD set them somehow. And it should be done BY
APPLICATION. What's wrong here ? Of course you can pass such limits in
kernel command line (the only thing known to kernel not from various
applications) but it's Wrong Thing(tm).
