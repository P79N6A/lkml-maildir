 If you really can't access the filesystem on wakeup, you could pull the
 required firmware into ram upon suspend and remove it after wakeup.
 Then while the system is running it will not use kernel memory.

 For this I proposed fwfs (a kernel friendly filesystem on top of
 ramfs), but it didn't get a good acceptance. And after reading Greg's
 recent post initramfs should be able to fill that gap.

 You will have to make sure that the firmware is copied into RAM before
 suspension, either via fwfs, initramfs or whatever persistence method
 gets implemented.

 The driver will not unload if request_firmware_nowait() has called
 try_module_get() on it.
 But the device could get disconnected and in that case the firmware
 load should be canceled. I'll add request_firmware_cancel().

 Why?, the current interface already provides termination notification.

 Why not?
 And anyway, request_firmware_nowait() could be used if that is an
 issue.

 Keep in mind that the "firmware in a header" method is not allowed
 any more. Drivers needing firmware will have to get their probe method
 modified to get the firmware from userspace anyway.
 Using request_firmware() if they can sleep (USB probe callbacks can
 sleep) is trivial, and using request_firmware_nowait() if they can't
 sleep is just a matter of splitting probe in two pieces.
 So, what alternative are you proposing to get the firmware?
 If your proposal is just keeping the firmware in a header so you just
 have it there all the time, you should discuss it with Alan, Greg,
 Jeff, et all, not me.
 Thanks
