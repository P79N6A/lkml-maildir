The only difficulty to remove a quantity of memory is how to find
where is easy to be removed. If this is fixed, I think it is
easier to address.
My own target is NUMA-node-hotplug.
I want to make the possibility of hotplug *remove a specific section* be close to 100%.
Considering NUMA node hotplug,
if a process is memory location sensitve, it should be migrated before node is removed.
So, process migration by hand before system's memory hotplug looks attractive to me.
If we can implement memory migration before memory hotplug in good way,
I think it's good.
