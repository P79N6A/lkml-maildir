Subject: [PATCH] 2.[46] Fix double reset in aic7xxx driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/7/12/193

Fix occasional PCI bus parity errors on the Dell PowerEdge 4600 during
boot.
Symptoms: The LCD display would turn orange and display "PCI SYSTEM
E13F5", and the following message would appear in /var/log/dmesg:
"Uhhuh. NMI received. Dazed and confused, but trying to continue".
By inserting a PCI card with a PDC20268 IDE controller and attaching to
that a Sony DRU-510A DVD RW burner with an unloaded tray, the failure
can be made to happen on every boot.
Cause: The aic7xxx driver was resetting the onboard AIC7891 SCSI controller
while waiting for a previous reset to complete.  This second reset confuses
the controller causing it to put bad data onto the PCI bus.
This is a backport of a RedHat 2.4.21-15.ELsmp fix.  A letter discussing
this problem, or one very close to it, may be found at:

Against 2.6.7 and 2.4.26.
Regards,
Joe
