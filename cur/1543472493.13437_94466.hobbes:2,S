Hi everyone,
I've written a driver for an intelligent multiport serial card.
I've got the firmware for the card in a separate file.
For "inside" the kernel, I should declare the firmware initdata and
it will get freed after booting.
For the module, I could link everything together (that's what I'm
doing right now), but this means I'm wasting a few tens of kilobytes
of unswappable kernel memory just for the firmware.
What I'd like to do is to have the "firmware" as a separate module
that can be unloaded after initializing the main driver.
The drawback is that the usage count of the firmware module will stick
at "1" if my main module is loaded. Can I decrease its usage count
"by hand" to allow it to unload once I'm done with it?
Anybody have any good tips about this?
For your information, take a look at the object files:
Two firmware objects:
-rw-r--r--   1 wolff    users        9324 Dec 19 17:08 si2_z280.o
-rw-r--r--   1 wolff    users       20368 Dec 14 12:45 si3_t225.o
and the two "code" objects:
-rw-r--r--   1 wolff    users        7588 Dec 17 16:38 generic_serial.o
-rw-r--r--   1 wolff    users       22860 Dec 20 09:49 sx.o
For the module, I'll make the main module (sx.o) depend on the
"generic_serial" module. 
If you have a Specialix SI/XIO or SX card, feel free to contact me to
help beta-testing this driver. (sorry, no free cards this time: those
have been given away already).
(If you have an SI card, you might have been using Simon Allens
driver. This is a completely new driver, and supports a few new
features. (e.g. several cards in one computer))
The new driver supports SX/ISA, SX/PCI and SI/ISA. Officially, the
SI/EISA and SI/PCI won't be supported. If someone with one of those
cards volunteers, it shouldn't be too hard to add support for them.
No guarantees though.....
Regards,
