Am I mad or is part of the problem that *everything* is in glibc? I'd love
to see things which were system interfaces but in user-space moved to a
libsys.so or libkernel.so or liblinux.so or something. A library that was
maintained with the kernel[0], which glibc could talk to. Basically make libc
what it (theoretically) once was, a library of utility functions for C
programmers. BCPL programs shouldn't need to be linked to libc <g>
[0] God knows how you deal with linking the right library for different
multiple major kernel versions installed on the same machine though; ld.so
hackery?
