Aye. The real problem with mount is that it always had been pretty
heavy-weight. Especially mount(8). I've done some (very rough) testing
on my tree - for ramfs-style filesystem latency of mount(2) is about
20% worse than latency of open(2). And it definitely can be improved -
right now I'm interested in getting the code cleaned.
mount(8) is a problem, but in nosuid namespace we can seriously cut
down on checks in the thing. And I'm very interested in designs that
would allow killing /etc/mtab - dropping it would allow very easy
mounting.
