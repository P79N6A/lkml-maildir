My point was that we go back to something simple which we can all
understand and build on.  The code which was just posted is quite
complex.  Although I trust that most of it is needed, the justification
for the complexity simply is not there.
By starting painfully simply, we can build on complexity in bits, and
justify it as we go.

I was in a meeting with a few coworkers, and we were arguing a bit about
naming.  One person there was a manager-type who didn't have any direct
involvement in the project.  We asked him which naming was more clear.
We need to think a bit like that.  What is more clear to somebody who
has never read the code?  (Hint "vx_" means nothing. :)

Could you elaborate a bit on this one?  What has cacheline problems?

We need something so simple that we probably don't even deal with ids.
I believe that Eric claims that we don't really need container _ids_.
For instance, the filesystem namespaces have no ids, and work just fine.
