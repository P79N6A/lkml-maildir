No,
1) Can you readily identify the very short code pathes? What about future 
code added to the kernel?
2) Having two parellel systems is a bad idea.
3) I believe RCU can be made much cheaper than the 
current implementation which look horrible.
I remember once discussing RCU on the list. I came up with the idea 
rcu_read_lock()/unlock() to be implemented as a per-task counter just as
preempt_disable()/disable(). The run-queue then has a sum of all the 
counters of tasks on that cpu (minus the counter for the current task).
I even made some sample code...
The only reason this wasn't considered working was the migration from CPU 
to CPU. I frankly can't see why this couldn't be fixed.
So the answer to you is: No. Fix the preemptible RCU instead. You have an 
idea above.
