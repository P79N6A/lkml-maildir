As far as I know uses Gentoo the configuration that
will be on the live-Cd. So 
1. they might be alot of not needed modules 
2. Some Hardware might be undetected.

The good thing about lspci (comparing to the others
Hardware detection like kudzu or discovery) it not
only uses the /proc files for getting the Hardware
information it also grabs its information directly
from the I/O of the Hardwares. But it lacks of getting
alls the Hardwares e.g. CD-Rom, floppy... 
It would be great if there is a Programm that gets all
the Hardware information directyl from the I/O
independent from the Kernel-installation.
