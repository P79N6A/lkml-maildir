Hello,
i have compiled AGP support and support for i81x chipsets in kernel.
My mainboard has a i815 chipset.
But while booting kernel, i get this message:
agpgart: Detected an Intel i815 Chipset, but could not find the
secondary device.
agpgart: Detected an Intel i815 Chipset.
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 262M
agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xf8000000
What does "but could not find the secondary device." mean?
Is anything going wrong?
regards,
hampel
