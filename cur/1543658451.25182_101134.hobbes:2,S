Ok, the problem is with scsi.h.
In a typedef for SCSI LUNs 'u8' is used, but not defined - either
'typedef u_int8_t u8' outside of the struct, or changing the
declaration to u_int8_t works. Thanks Misha...
Not sure whose repository this bug belongs to, it's either
linux-dj/linux-2.5 or linux/linux-2.5. The error is at line 185 of
scsi.h.

Josh
