We have to make sure we are not preemptible when we use
__get_cpu_var, since it uses smp_processor_id().  It's not clear to me
that we have ensured that in every case where we use __get_cpu_var.
Are you sure that we hold a spinlock, or are at interrupt level, or
have explicitly disabled preemption at every point where we use
__get_cpu_var?
Regards,
Paul.
