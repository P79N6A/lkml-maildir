I would have hoped so too at the time. Reporting it to the list didn't get any
response since it was already fixed upstream, but it took a while before it
was merged down to the linux tree.
Also, it seems chipsets can be wired up differently in different motherboards.
A driver can work perfectly for hundreds of boards and still fail on the same
chipset on another machine.
In any case "X code is broken" "why not use Y code instead" isn't really
productive. It's a good thing I was using the OSS drivers; if everyone used
the alsa drivers and nobody was testing the OSS drivers nobody would know they
were broken.
