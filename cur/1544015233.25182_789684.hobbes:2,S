thinking about this.. making a "pastebin" like thing for oopses is
relatively trivial for me; all the building blocks I have already.
The hard part is getting the vmlinux files in place. Right now I do
this manually for popular released kernels.. if the fedora/suse guys
would help to at least have the vmlinux for their released updates
easily available that would be a huge help.... without that it's going
to suck.
