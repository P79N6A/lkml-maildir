Tis true, and a shame...  ;o(
Rather than blaming anyone, I'd rather just get pointers to
manufacturers who make boards for folks like me who want to get
what we need, rather than suck up to windows..
The way things are going now in Linux anyways, I'll likely be
able to use any ISA cards over a LAN anyways regardless of wether
they are sound/video or whatever.
Anyone working on "isad"?  ;o)  A daemon that exports ISA devices
over ethernet?  ;o)
