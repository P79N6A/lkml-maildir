No it does not, at least not here, and neither with pcmcia-cs nor with the
kernel-based code.  The first one claims to work, but i can not access the
Modem after initialization. The second one fails to allocate all resources

I know.  But since i need windows for now to watch DVD's and to play Alpha
Centauri, there is a W98SE installation on my notebook as well. ;-)
Shouldn't be to difficult to get a help2info converter so.  The file format
