That `;' above is NOT in just the last one. In your above
example, all the labels will execute the same `;' statement.
In fact, the default behaviour of the switch() operation is
to fall through to the next defined label and you have to put
in an explicit `break;' if you want to prevent `case 0:' from
reaching the `;' below the `case 3:'...

Rik
