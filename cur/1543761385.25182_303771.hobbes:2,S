On a side, issue, e2fsck was unable to find any problem on that
filesystem after the i_blocks had wrapped exactly to zero.
The bug seems to be in e2fsck/pass1.c: we do the numblocks checking
inside process_block(), which is called as an inode block iteration
function in check_blocks().  Then, later, check_blocks() does
	if (inode->i_file_acl && check_ext_attr(ctx, pctx, block_buf))
		pb.num_blocks++;
	pb.num_blocks *= (fs->blocksize / 512);
but without any further testing to see if pb.num_blocks has exceeded the
max_blocks.  So by the time we've got to the end of check_blocks(),
we're testing the wrapped i_blocks on disk against the wrapped
num_blocks in memory, and so e2fsck fails to notice anything wrong.
The fix may be as simple as just moving the
	if (inode->i_file_acl && check_ext_attr(ctx, pctx, block_buf))
		pb.num_blocks++;
earlier in the function; Ted, do you see any problems with that?
