which speaking of cdrecord and sg...
not sure if this is a cdrecord bug or a sg driver bug, but the scan mode
of
cdrecord can't handle two scsi controllers right.  I have two wide scsi
controllers
the first one has drives at id's 12 and 13.  the second has a CD at id 2
and a CDRW at id3.  the cdrecord scan dumps the two drives onto the
second controller.  
Just wondering if anyone knew whos bug it was (is the scsi interface
returning the info that way or is cdrecord parsing it wrong).  Or is
there a way I can check?  would strace 
show me?
Regards,
Steve
