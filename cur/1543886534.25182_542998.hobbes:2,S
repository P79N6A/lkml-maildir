Thanks for the comments Jean.  I've got some questions/comments below.

Hmmm; I didn't see those warning here, but I'm probably running on a
different arch (ppc32).  I'll make it more robust.

I was following the lead of the ds1337 and ds1374 chips, but I will
happily move it if so desired.

Mostly because i2c_smbus_write_i2c_block_data allows me to specify the
tranfer length, but i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data does not.  I
couldn't figure out how to request an exact transfer size and I was
using ds1374 as an example which also transfers byte-at-a-time.

Both of these checks are from an ignorance of sysfs.  I didn't know
what was guaranteed and based on what was writting in LDDv3, I thought
that I could end up receiving a page of *anything* from userspace.
I've just looked through the code, and fill_write_buffer() does do
what you said.  I'll remove these checks.

Heh; I'll submit a patch for Documentation/i2c/writing-clients too then.

This is also from Documentation/i2c/writing-clients.  I'll fix this.

:-(  No, there is no way to id the device from the contents of the
registers.  How do I test for the number of registers?

This was done by scripts/Lindent.  I'll change it if you really want
me to.  I've gotten into the habit of running all my code through
Lindent before committing to avoid as many whitespace complaints as
possible.
If this spacing is wrong, does Lindent need to be fixed?

Ditto on Lindent.

Thanks, I'll fix it up and resubmit.
