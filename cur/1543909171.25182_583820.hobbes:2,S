Which is why it requires an LSM interface. Just checking.

The specification of your push interface that the push operation
not affect how others access the process is OK for SELinux, but
not for any other MAC scheme that I've dealt with, and I think
that's most of them. Nuts. Smack, for example, uses exactly one
label on the process for all purposes.
Are you concerned about accesses other than signals? Signals
could be staitforward to deal with in a pushed situation, but
I'd hesitate to say that the solution would generalize without
additional thought.

I'm not sure I understand what this is doing.
