No, not all of them, but the vast majority. There are multiple
differences, the most important one being the 'counting' in
semaphores. You can e.g. define a semaphore that can be held
by N users at the same time, but not more. In a mutex, N is
by definition 1, so only one thread can hold a mutex.
There are other subtle differences in the implementation, e.g.
you cannot mutex_trylock at interrupt time.
