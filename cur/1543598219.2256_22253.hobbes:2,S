Subject: Patch for bizzare oops in USB
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I ran webcam(1) with ov511 and if I hit ^C, the box oopses.
Apparently, the following happens:
1. On SIGINT, v4l closes ov511, which isses a string of
   control requests to quescent the cam.
2. One of those requests enters usb_internal_control_msg
   where it submits the URB and does schedule_timeout().
3. Since the signal is pending [sic], it does not wait,
   but spins testing urb->status.
4. The interrupt is taken on other CPU and it gets into
   sohci_return_urb, then clears status and calls urb_rm_priv.
5. The user thread sees that status becomes zero and *frees the URB*.
6. The urb_rm_priv takes a spinlock and does its dirty buseness.
7. User thread reallocates the URB and resubmits it,
   waiting on the spinlock meanwhile.
8. urb_rm_priv zaps urb->dev in the URB which was already
   freed and reallocated and releases the spinlock.
9. The user thread keels over deep inside td_submit_urb()
   dereferencing urb->dev->something
Took me a couple of days to figure it all out. :)
