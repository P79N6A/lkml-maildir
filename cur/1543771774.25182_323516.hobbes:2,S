A lot of times I see mails getting forwarded to you/Andrew/other
maintainer by someone without adding a From: or other indication of
who was the original author, but in almost all cases the original
author is the one listed as the first Signed-off-by: since authors are
the first to sign off on a patch, so, wouldn't it make more sense to
pick the author like this ;
1) If there's a "From:" at the start of the email, use that (note: a
lot of times this actually breaks since From: is often set by
maintainers to the person who forwarded the mail, not the actual
author, but that's a matter of educating maintainers).
2) if there's no "From:" in the mail body, pick first "signed-off-by:" 
3) Fall back on email headers.
