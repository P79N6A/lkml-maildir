My soundcard is a SB16, and using the wrapper for rvplayer that I believe
ignores the NONBLOCK flag makes it start working again. Unfortunately,
netscape uses dynamic libraries for the plugins instead of the rvplayer
executable and any realaudio through the plugin fails to work. Does anyone
know of a workaround for the shared libraries?
