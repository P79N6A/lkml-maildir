If you're using a recent kernel (> 2.1.something), it will work.

If you set the right optimization flags in Makefile and
arch/i386/Makefile, you can get quite a speed increase...
You might want to look at gcc 2.95.1 as well - it includes several of
pgcc's optimizations (including k5/k6 stuff), and in some situations
outperforms pgcc 1.1.x.
I'd recommend against using pgcc 2.95.something for now - there are too
many bugs in it.
