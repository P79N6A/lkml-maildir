Sounds fine.

Oh, I have a patch pending for dmsetup to export a bunch of variables in
the environment format with a single call, so we can use it udev
context.
Here is the list, just that we don't clash with names or use the same
names where appropriate:
  DM_NAME=
  DM_UUID=
  DM_STATE=
  DM_TABLE_STATE=
  DM_OPENCOUNT=
  DM_MAJOR=
  DM_MINOR=
  DM_TARGET_COUNT=
  DM_TARGET_TYPES=
  DM_LAST_EVENT_NR=
Let me know if something should be renamed.
Thanks,
Kay
