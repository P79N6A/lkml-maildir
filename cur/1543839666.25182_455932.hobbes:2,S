Hi Jeff:
(3)Yes, This is a bug, I will correct it. Thanks.
(4)This will halt TxDMA and RxDMA, after that will let reseting safely.
Should I add description in source code or in change log?
Thanks!
Jesse

Correct.
Also:
(3) Use iowrite16(), not writew().  I just noticed this bug.
iowrite16() will work for both MMIO and IO cycles, writew() only works
for MMIO.
(4) We need a description of why this change is needed.  What does
writing 0x500 to DMACtrl actually do?  Why do we need to do this?
