The numbers I have seen so far don't make this obvious.  Tony Luck
reports 95Mbps with a CPU load of 20% after a fixing a performance bug
in the software I/O TLB.  Arjan reported the same 95Mbps figure with
the highmem approach.  Arjan didn't report the CPU load and neither
Tony nor Arjan specified the test environment they were using.

We could do this if we there was a GFP_4GB zone.  Now that 2.5 is open
for business, it won't be long, right?
