Well, the code in mm/init.c is only executed really early, before zones
are initialized, and it uses alloc_low_page() to map memory.  Thus it seems
I only could make my code be executed next to init_memory_mapping(),
in which case I wouldn't be able to use page flags.  Apparently I'm missing
something but now I'm too tired to think efficiently.

Fine with me.
