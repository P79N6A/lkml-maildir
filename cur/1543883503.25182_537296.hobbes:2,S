Well, I'm a moody bastard, and I would hope other people handle
this better than I. However, all the bugzillas of this world
are full with old, ignored bugs, amd I thought this might
serve as an explanation why.
Developers are just humans and if they have no incentive to
act on a bug report they will ignore it. I think this is a
fact that you have to deal with.
It's also not necessarily the fault of the reporter if
a bug report gets ignored, but for every report a developer
has to make a decision to handle it or not, and there are
lots of reasons why he may decide to not handle it, or
at least not now (and then forget about it).
But I'm quite sure that an important bug would be reported
again until fixed.
