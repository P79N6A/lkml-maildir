From the changelog for the patch which added these functions:
Adds 3 new completion API calls, which are a straightforward extension of
the current APIs:
 int wait_for_completion_interruptible(struct completion *x);
 unsigned long wait_for_completion_timeout(struct completion *x,
                                                   unsigned long timeout);
 unsigned long wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(
                        struct completion *x, unsigned long timeout);
This enables the conversion of more semaphore-using code to completions.
There is code that cannot be converted right now (and is forced to use
semaphores) because these primitives are missing.  Thomas Gleixner has a
bunch of patches to make use of them.
