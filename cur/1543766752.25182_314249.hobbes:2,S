I did now a lot of additional tests. When running
"insmod kgettime.ko" from the console (not from x-windows)
I get:
kprobe registered address c0107bd0 // output from the module
double fault, gdt at c049bd00 [255 bytes]
double fault, tss at c03d4060
eip = c0103c86, esp = db932000
eax = ffffffff, ebx = db932134, ecx = 0000000d, edx = 00000000
esi = db932080, edi = 0000000d
Alt+SysRq did not work...
Then I removed all my modules (except 2) I was able to load the module
without problems. I added module by module and checked every time with
"insmod kgettime.ko". When loading the "ohci1394" module it crashed
again. But next time I loaded the "ohci"-module first - no crash.  (So I
don't think it is the ohci-module). I was able to load all modules and
it still worked.
Hmmm. What else to check?
