Subject: [PATCH sched-devel 2/7] cpuisol: Do not route IRQs to the CPUs isolated at boot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Most people would expect isolated CPUs to not get any
IRQs by default. This happens naturally if a CPU is brought
off-line, marked isolated and then brought back online.
There was some confusion about this patch originaly. So I wanted
to clarify that it does not completely disable IRQ handling on
the isolated CPUs. Users still have the option or routing IRQs
to them by modifying IRQ affinity mask.
I cannot test other archs hence the patch is for x86_64 only.
