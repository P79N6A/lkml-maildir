There are junk interrupt events sent to ohci1394's IRQ handler.

OK, ohci1394 shares an interrupt with IDE and USB.  (Normally not a
problem.)

It is not an issue to build firewire-ohci and ohci1394, but you should
only load one of them.  Since recent distributions insert modules
automatically according to found hardware on one hand and module aliases
on the other hand, you can achieve this by the line
blacklist firewire-ohci
or blacklist ohci1394 in /etc/modprobe.conf.  Note, many distributions
generate modprobe.conf from files in /etc/modprobe.d/, hence you should
put that line into a file in that directory, then tell the system to
regenerate modprobe.conf.  (E.g. Gentoo uses the command
"update-modules" to regenerate modprobe.conf.)
That said, I assumed so far that inserting both drivers doesn't pose a
problem.  The driver core should simply bind one of these two drivers to
the actual hardware, shouldn't it?  The only problem would be that it is
somewhat unclear which of the two drivers will be used.  (In your case,
ohci1394 won the interrupt.  You can also check the symlinks in sysfs to
find out which driver is bound to the respective PCI device.)
One thing you could quickly test is what happens if you make manually
sure that (a) only ohci1394 is inserted, (b) only firewire-ohci is inserted.
Anybody please correct me if my assumption about two PCI drivers for the
same class of PCI devices is wrong.

I thought about preventing this sort of configuration --- but in the
end, it is an entirely valid configuration.
So, could somebody clue us in where the false interrupts might come from?
