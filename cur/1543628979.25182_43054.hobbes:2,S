Is there any package or program, which can be used to accurately measure the
CPU cycles used by a program? I think the following code can only provide an
inaccurate one, beause it may count on the waiting time of the program.
gettimeofday(t1)
runprogam
gettimeofday(t2)
t2-t1
If I need to instrument the kernel, which part I should investigate? Thanks
a lot in advance
Wanghong
