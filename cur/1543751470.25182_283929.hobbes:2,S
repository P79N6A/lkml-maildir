Hello,
   I accept that we can't have a process both blocked
and in the runqueue. See, I want to give a special
state to the process blocked on a particular resource
like semaphore as TASK_BLOCKED and I will not add it
into the wait queue. 
   If the scheduler picks up this blocked process
again, I will identify the process that is having the
semaphore and I will run that.  with this, I am giving
some timeslice of the blocked process to the process
having that resource so that it can release it soon.
  So, if a process blocks on the syscall, I will
change the state as TASK_MYSTATE. Since, a process may
block on a system call for many reasons, I am not able
to clearly figure out how can I do that? Can u help me
regarding this?
Thanks,
selva
