Actually, we tend to use multiple media at the same time.
It happens very often that because of some discussion on
IRC we end up writing up a few paragraphs and sending it
to people by email.
For other things, email is clearly too slow, so stuff is
done on IRC (eg. walking somebody through a piece of code
to identify and agree on a bug).
cheers,
Rik
