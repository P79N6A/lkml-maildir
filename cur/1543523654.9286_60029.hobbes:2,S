Very right. I fixed this quite some time ago. Run 2.2.14aa*latest or apply
this my patch on the top of 2.2.14 (or 2.2.12):
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.2/2.2.14aa3/SMP-scheduler-2.2.11-E.gz
I fixed this into the mid 2.3.x series (try out something like 2.3.17) but
FYI now the latest 2.3.4? are returned to not work correctly.
