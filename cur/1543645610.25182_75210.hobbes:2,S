    From what I found until now it *seems* that we will not able to compile 
   the 2.4.x kernel. Is this true ?
There are quite a few dependencies on ELF, such as the ability to put
code/data into arbitrarily named sections.  If COFF can do this,
you're fine.
There are other dependencies on ELF, I just can't name them off the
top of my head right now.
