ext4 has quite an unusual development model for kernel code, other 
code in the state of ext4 is usually only in -mm and not in stable 
kernels.
Stable kernels are mainly meant for usage, not for trying stuff.
And although I see a point in perhaps shipping some not-yet-perfect 
device drivers for otherwise unsupported hardware or some
not-yet-perfect filesystems required for accessing foreign
(non-Linux) filesystems, I don't see any point in offering a
WIP Linux-only filesystem in stable kernels.
