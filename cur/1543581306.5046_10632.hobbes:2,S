Highly unlikely since the VM rebalancing patch doesn't change
any of the actual swapout mechanisms.
All it does is change how often the particular algorithms get
called by kswapd and by user programs.
As for trigerring the OOM killer, this strongly suggest a
memory leak since there's a bug in the code which makes it
very hard to trigger the OOM killer under normal situations
(I'm working on a fix for that now).

Rik
