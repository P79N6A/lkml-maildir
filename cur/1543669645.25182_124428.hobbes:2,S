    This, I'm not too sure about.  I see the value to kernel developers who
    boot between different versions of the kernel, but I think when 2.6 goes
    live and ships to end users, it's better not to have such numeric
    equivalency crufting up the SCSI interfaces.
I think compatibility is very important.
Linux does not arbitrarily break old systems. The aim must be
to have all combinations of (old/new) kernel with (old/new) glibc
to work well in all situations where old kernel + old glibc worked.
