Subject: serial console after panic() (2.4.21)

serial console stops working immediately when for example root fs cannot be 
mounted - kernel does panic() and serial console no longer works.
With working console I could reboot (send break+b), and choose proper kernel 
from lilo but it doesn't work that way so using own foot to get to company 
and server room is required.
Why code does something that makes serial console usunable in such case?
It seems that not being able to mount root fs isn't so big deal to do 
,,something'' that makes serial console not working.
