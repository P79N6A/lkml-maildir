Various people are running around converting open-coded kernel_thread
callers over to the kthread API.  Generally that's a good thing, and error
checking should be incorporated at that time.
So there's probably not a lot of point in making these changes now - it'd
be better to work with the various subsystem owners on doing the kthread
conversion.

This is OK as far as it goes.  But really we should propagate any failure
back up to cmm_init() and fail the whole thing, rather than leaving the
driver hanging around in a loaded-but-useless state.
