That is a purely theoretical limit.  ext2 can only sit on a single block
device at once: it cannot span block devices.  The block device layer
_cannot_ address 4TB: 2^32 * 512 bytes (the sector size) is 2TB, which
is a hard upper limit on any block device for now.  On Linux, you cannot
make an ext2fs filesystem larger than that (and if we find any sign
extension problems in the block IO request layers, then 1TB becomes the
limit).
