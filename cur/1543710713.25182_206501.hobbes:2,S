You might want to check out the list of benchmarks collected at:
http://lse.sourceforge.net/io/aio.html
I found that adapting existing benchmarks made it hard to test some of
the aio corner cases, so aio-stress is just a big state machine, with
options to tweak how badly you want to abuse the aio subsystem.  
There are a few other good ones on the page though.
