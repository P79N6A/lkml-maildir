Subject: [PATCH 0/5] forcedeth: several proposed updates for testing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The 'fe-lock' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git fe-lock
contains the following changes that I would like to get tested:
      [netdrvr] forcedeth: make NAPI unconditional
      [netdrvr] forcedeth: interrupt handling cleanup
      [netdrvr] forcedeth: process TX completions using NAPI
      [netdrvr] forcedeth: internal simplification and cleanups
      [netdrvr] forcedeth: timer overhaul
These are intended for feedback and testing, NOT for merging.
The goals of these changes are:
* move the driver towards a more sane, simple, easy to verify locking
  setup -- irq handler would often acquire/release the lock twice
  for each interrupt -- and hopefully
* to eliminate a rarely used, apparently fragile locking scheme that
  includes heavy use of disable_irq().  this tool is most often employed
  during NIC reset/reconfiguration, so satisfying this goal implies
  changing the way NIC reset and config are accomplished.
Miscellaneous notes:
* using the new napi_struct stuff in net-2.6.24, the TX completion
  process has been moved to a -separate- NAPI polling channel.  thus
  there are now two napi_structs, one for RX and one for TX, independent
  of each other.
* I feel TX NAPI is a useful tool, because it provides an independent TX
  process control point and system load feedback point.
  Thus I felt this was slightly superior to tasklets.
* But who knows if this is a good idea?  :)  I am interested in
  feedback and criticism on this issue.
