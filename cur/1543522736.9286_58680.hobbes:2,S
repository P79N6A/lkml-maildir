Hi!
I need to parse the packets received and sent when using an audio
application such as RealPlayer G2. For that, I'm going to introduce some
code in the networking IP stack of the Linux kernel. I have several
basic questions:
(1) Is RealPlayer using any kind of RTP or RTSP protocol at the
application layer?
(2) What's the relationship between RTP and RTSP?
(3) Can somebody give me the stack picture for this scenario? (maybe
something like: ETHERNET / IP / UDP / RTSP?)
(4) How can I parse the application level payload? Is it text based the
same way HTTP is?
Thanks a lot!!
Jordi
