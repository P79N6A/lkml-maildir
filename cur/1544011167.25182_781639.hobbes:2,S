Well, it's not just btrfs, it's also md, lvm and xfs.  I think the right
way is to make the single node for the /dev/disk/by-uuid/ just a legacy
case for potential multiple devices.  E.g. by having
/dev/disk/by-uuid/
	0cdedd75-2d03-41e6-a1eb-156c0920a021	-> ../../sda10
	0cdedd75-2d03-41e6-a1eb-156c0920a021.d
		foo				-> ../../sda10
		bar				-> ../../sda9
where foo nad bar could be uuids if the filesystem / volume manager
supports it, otherwise just the short name for it.

Again, that's something we should do generically for the whole
/dev/disk/ tree.   For that we need to merge libvolume_id and libblkid
so that it has a few related but separate use cases:
 - a lowlevel probe what fs / volume manager / etc is this for
   the udev callout, mkfs, strip size detection etc
 - a way to rescan everything, either for non-udev static /dev case
   or your above recovery scenario
 - plus potentially some sort of caching for the non-recovery static
   /dev case
I've long planned to put you and Ted into a room and not let you out
until we see white smoke :)
