Looking in to these atm.

The only functional difference when you enable CONFIG_SECTION_MISMATCH is the
addition of the -fno-inline-functions-called-once to CFLAGS.
So we have some code somewhere that breaks if it is not inlined by gcc.
It would be nice to sort out where.
If you have a rough idea where to look you could use the following trick.
Drop CONFIG_SECTION_MISMATCH and build a kernel.
Then for the file/directory where you think the no-inle makes
a difference do:
# To build the dir/file
rm dir/*.o
make KBUILD_NOCMDDEP=1 KCFLAGS=-fno-inline-functions-called-once dir/
# And then link the kernel
make KBUILD_NOCMDDEP=1
The KBUILD_NOCMDDEP=1 tell kbuild to ignore any commandline differences
so kbuild will not rebuild due to changed gcc flags.
Let me know if you need assistance with this.
