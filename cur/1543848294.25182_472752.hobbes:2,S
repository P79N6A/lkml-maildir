It's likely that ARM will switch over to using the MMIO resources if
this patch makes it in.  There's certain ARM platforms which would
benefit from this change (since inb() and friends are more complex
than they necessarily need to be.)
However, one issue needs to be solved before we could do that - how do
we handle the case where the IDE registers are on a 4 byte spacing
interval instead of the usual 1 byte?
I notice that this driver is calling ata_std_ports() which handles
the standard setup.  Maybe that needs to become a little more inteligent?
