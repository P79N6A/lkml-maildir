I haven't even stated which distribution I'm running. How can you
possibly know what it puts into /etc/cdrecord.conf when it detects my
CD-R? What relation has this to your man page?

I have experience that buffer underruns do not occur, when I am not
running as root. Therefore I posted a statement that running as root is
not strictly necessary. What part of that do you not understand?

Perhaps I should. But I think that in the last few days you've managed
to lose even the shred of credibility you once had. I shall now take
anything you say with an _extremely_ large pinch of salt.
