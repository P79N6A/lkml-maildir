After fixing some blecherous line-wrap issues, the patches applied
OK to a 2.6.10-rc1-mm2-RT-V0.7.11 tree (a few offsets here and there,
no rejects).
I'm currently running with 3 LSM's stacked (SELinux, capabilities, and
a local LSM that provides OpenWall functionality), and all seems to be
working *mostly* OK.  I'll post the LSM as soon as I refactor a few
patches.
One issue:  I'm seeing this from /usr/sbin/sendmail:
% /usr/sbin/sendmail
drop_privileges: setuid(0) succeeded (when it should not)
I've not tracked down what's causing this indigestion yet (I suspect some
bad interaction with capabilities - that's what caused that message to be
added to Sendmail in the first place).
