I'd have to do some tests... Hopefully in this decade, forget it for
now.
The primary reason - consistency with hw VLAN cards -> simpler
code.
The performance is already decreased (not sure if it's noticeable)
most of the time, i.e., when not transparently bridging VLAN
trunks. Bridging VLAN trunks is, of course, theoretically possible,
but it's rather not a common operation when using .1Q.
That is, with header reordering, of course.
Anyway, -ENOPATCH from me for now.
