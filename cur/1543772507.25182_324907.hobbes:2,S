The balancing code is not really aware that the loads being returned are being 
altered and it was not clear whether this would be needed or not as it 
usually bases its decisions on ratios of load rather than absolute amounts. 
The tricky part is idle balancing where we don't want to try and pull from a 
queue that only has one running task and the patch has a "if single task 
running and idle balancing tell it only one task running and don't bias" 
feature. This may cause slight performance effects on numa as I guess the 
other nodes suddenly seem much more loaded and we normally wouldn't try 
balancing between nodes until there was a larger load discrepancy than 
between cpus. I'll think on this and see how much more nice-aware the 
balancing code needs to be for this to not have any effect.
Cheers,
Con
