I had these problems in the past with a inconsitent XFS Filesystem, I'd 
recommend to run xfs_repair on your XFS filesystems, using a external 
Rescue CD - bootdisk/bootCD. If you have none handy, drop me a mail.
The fs-troubles on my server was arising using a Highend-Caching 
controller (ICP-Vortex), and not flushing the cache before power down.
After several power downs the XFS had headaches, and I had such 
kernel-oops.
