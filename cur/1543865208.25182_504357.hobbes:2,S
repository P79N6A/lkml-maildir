Why do you think so?  In my eyes it's actually one of the few useful
applications for RDMA, especially combined with something like pnfs [*].
Also if you'd look at the patches they're very clean - it's just another
possible transport with almost no invastion to the core code.
[*] yes, the actual pnfs spec is fugly as hell and symptom of the nfsv4
    design by comittee braindamage, but the idea is sound..
