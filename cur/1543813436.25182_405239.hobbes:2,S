Yeah, and Linux has never supported memory resource control either, right?

Not really, but I think there is a demand for memory resource control today.
The memory controller in ckrm also breaks out the LRU, but puts one
LRU instance in each class. My code does not depend on ckrm, but it
should be possible to have some kind of resource control with this
patch and cpusets. And yeah, add numa emulation if you are out of
nodes. =)
