   How necessary is it to defragment ones ext2 partitions? It just hit
   me that defragmentation is very important under the Wintendo
   filesystem. I'v= e found the program e2defrag which is just a small
   hack done to defrag (Stephen C. Tweedie) to make it work under the
   2.2 kernel. The problem is that in the README-0.71 it says:
   "I have NOT tested this yet, all I know is it compiles and *should*
   work, but I am not making any gurantees, so DO NOT use this on any
   filesystems with important data that you have not backed up. It would
   perobably even be a good idea to test this on a dummy filesystem
   first.
It's not necessary under most normal conditions, which is one of the
reasons why the e2defrag preogram hasn't really been maintained.  
E2fsck displays a statistic, "number of non-contiguous files", which is
roughly a good metric for how fragmented the filesystem is, except if
you have lots of large files, since large files that are bigger than a
block group (8 megs or 32 megs) have to be non-contiguous by the nature
of the ext2 filesystem.
Under most operating conditions, defragmentation really shouldn't be
necessary.
