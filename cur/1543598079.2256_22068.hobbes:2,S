I've done a bit more reading. The documentation I have here suggests the 
precharge doesn't erase all of memory.  Precharge copies from the sense 
amplifiers back into the current row. The erasure is a result of the 
sense amplifiers losing their contents faster than the memory cells, but 
even so only one of the 2^12 rows gets erased.
