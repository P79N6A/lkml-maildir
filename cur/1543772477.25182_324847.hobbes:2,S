Well, the bizarre part is that I think this has been around for a while, but 
it
does not exhibit itself in redhat kernels which postdate the earliest
recolloction of me seeing it. 2.6.11-rc1 is the earliest I remember,
but I am not religious about updating the kernel on this box so
my samples are spotty.
The difference between the two may be that I recompile for a P4
while redhat uses a lowest common denominator cpu type.
If I get a chance this weekend I will try some other kernels and
report back. Maybe just start out by dumbing down my cpu
type.
