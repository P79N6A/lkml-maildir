What?  And creating a high level API which allows you to implement 
totally random silicon with oodles of quirks and obfuscated 
implementation requirements creates more maintainability how?  We tried 
to stay as close as possible to the hardware ABI on purpose, 
specifically so we don't need to introduce 100 new concepts into the kernel.
