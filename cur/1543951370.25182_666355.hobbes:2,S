I certainly approve of giving page_cgroups their own kmem_cache
(and agree with Kame that it was overkill for the zones).
But I don't agree with the SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN you've slipped into
this version.  That'll be wasting a lot of (all? more than?) the
space you're trying to save with a kmem_cache, won't it?  Let me
talk about that separately, in reply to the mail where you report
the numbers.
Are you proposing this page_cgroup_cache mod for 2.6.25 or for 2.6.26?
I ask because I want to build upon it to fix up some GFP_ flag issues:
I think we end up claiming the page_cgroups are __GFP_MOVABLE when they
should be called __GFP_RECLAIMABLE; but I don't know how seriously we
take MOVABLE/RECLAIMABLE discrepancies at present.
There's a patch I'd also like to build upon from Christoph in -mm
(remove-set_migrateflags.patch), which sheds light on a similar issue
with radix_tree_nodes).  It's importance is again dependent on how
seriously we're taking MOVABLE/RECLAIMABLE discrepancies.
