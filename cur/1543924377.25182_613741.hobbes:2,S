however, if you can manage to avoid seeks by packing more data onto each 
track (or each stripe of a raid array) you could probably see a 
significant win
that's something for aspiring (and experianced) filesystem designers to 
struggle with for a while (especially trying to figure out what the size 
of a track or stripe is for the optimal layout)
