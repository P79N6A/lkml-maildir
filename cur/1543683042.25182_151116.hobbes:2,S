I'm not saying you should write your paragraphs backwards such as your
Cafe sign.  It's more of an organizational thing than an order of
reading thing.  When I sort my ToDo list I put the things most important
on top, when I sort my mail, I put the things I need to read on top,
etc.  This way the most important piece (the newest comment in this
case) is on top and I don't have to go digging for it.
Not everyone puts inline responses and they're not always needed.  If
you place some a good idea is one a co-worker uses:
  See inline comments below.
4 works, 1 line.  Tells us there is content he added mixed in.
Otherwise I don't have to waste time and effort digging through the
rants, flames and fluff wondering "is there something down here?"...
:wq!
