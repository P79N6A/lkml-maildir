Hi,
I didn't follow all of the scheduler debates and flamewars, so apologies
if this was already covered. Anyway.
lmbench 3 lat_ctx context switching time with 2 processes bound to a
single core increases by between 25%-35% on my Core2 system (didn't do
enough runs to get more significance, but it is around 30%). The problem
bisected to the main CFS commit.
I was really hoping that a smaller runqueue data structure could actually
increase performance with the common case of small numbers of tasks :(
I assume this was a known issue before CFS was merged. Do you know what is
causing the slowdown? Any plans to fix it?
Thanks,
Nick
