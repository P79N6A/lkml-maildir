I've also been seeing these messages (for a very, very long time), with
both the uhci and usb-uhci drivers, with many different devices (not
just visor).  Usually the only way to fix it is to have the usb stuff
compiled as modules, remove it all, and the re-insmod it all.  Then it
works again for a little while...
There really needs to be only one driver.  It's just confusing.

Never had to reboot though...on either x86 or alpha with UHCI...
