(relative to git-x86#mm 05afd57b4438d4650d93e6f54f465b0cdd2d9ea8) 
They should be all safe/useful enough to be considered .25 candidates.
Some minor features for pageattr.c:
- Use less memory in the !DEBUG_PAGEALLOC case
(second patch for that is just a optional cleanup)
- Support CPU self snoop (resubmit of earlier patch)
- Add some statistic counters about the direct mapping to /proc/meminfo
- Shrink code size by doing less inlining
- Remove obsolete BUG()s
The patches are all fairly independent (except the two debug-pagealloc patches) 
so it's possible to cherry-pick.
