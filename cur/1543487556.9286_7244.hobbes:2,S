Hello,
I am experiencing a funny situation on one of our machines.
Setup:
	HP NetServer LX Pro (4 Cpus)
	Kernel 2.2.1
	DPT Raid 3334UW + 12x9Gig disks formed as 6 raid-1
	512 Mb ram
	128 Mb swap
Situation:
Each evening, at 23.00, 23.20 and 23.40, 3 cron jobs are started.   They
recompiles the days work of Cobol-code (2100 objects) in 3 versions.
Every since 2.1.108 (maybe 2.1.107), the finish time of these 3 jobs has
increased - the number of objects are more or less the same.   This is
the start/end time for one of the jobs:
Start                               End
Sun Feb 21 23:40:00 CET 1999        Mon Feb 22 02:54:53 CET 1999
Mon Feb 22 23:40:01 CET 1999        Tue Feb 23 06:17:14 CET 1999
Tue Feb 23 23:40:00 CET 1999        Wed Feb 24 07:04:27 CET 1999
Wed Feb 24 23:40:00 CET 1999        Thu Feb 25 07:23:21 CET 1999
Thu Feb 25 23:40:01 CET 1999        Fri Feb 26 08:59:14 CET 1999
As you can see, the end time spans from 02:54 to 08:59, without any
incease in objects.   During 5 days, the system has become 6 hours
'slower'.    The load seems to be rising faster and faster during this
period (This system is a lightly loaded system: 6-7 people is using it
at most times).
Going back to 2.1.108 gives us 'end'-times at 2:55 to 3:15 ....
What parameters can I play around with, to get back my normal
'end'-times?
Kind regards,
Brian
