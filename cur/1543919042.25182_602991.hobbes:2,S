Hi!
I've found that gbit vs. 100mbit power consumption difference is about
1W -- pretty significant. (Maybe powertop should include it in the
tips section? :).
Energy Star people insist that machines should switch down to 100mbit
when network is idle, and I guess that makes a lot of sense -- you
save 1W locally and 1W on the router.
Question is, how to implement it correctly? Daemon that would watch
data rates and switch speeds using mii-tool would be simple, but is
that enough?
