BTW, some gunk appears to have migrated into this patch that should have
been earlier in the series.  I'll fix that up.
What do you think about the attached patch?  It delays actually touching
i_nlink until the place where saved_nlink used to be zero'd.  I assume
that is the point when we're sure that the inode is going to go away.
Also, instead of just clearing i_nlink for the directory case, I just do
two decrements.  I did that for a few other filesystems as well.  I
guess it can be collapsed to a single operation, but I'm not sure it is
worth the trouble.
Completely and utterly untested, uncompiled patch attached.  Please
consider its filename a formal apology for calling your filesystem
screwy. :)
It might also be worth putting the 'double decrement i_nlink if it is a
directory' behavior in libfs.c.  It appears to be pretty common logic
around the different filesystems.
Thanks for the thorough review!
