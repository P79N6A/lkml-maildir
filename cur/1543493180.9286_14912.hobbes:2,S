Did 26071 loops in 3.00 seconds (8692.22 loops/sec)
wh@frodo:~/programming/testing > mkdir /usr/local/tmp/newdir
wh@frodo:~/programming/testing > ./tmpfs /usr/local/tmp/newdir/
Did 32696 loops in 3.00 seconds (10912.29 loops/sec)
wh@frodo:~/programming/testing > mkdir /tmp/newdir
wh@frodo:~/programming/testing > ./tmpfs /tmp/newdir/
Did 25906 loops in 3.00 seconds (8643.41 loops/sec)
This seems to explain the difference between /home/wh and /tmp, which are
both on the same partition. But the RAID0 array /usr is still faster.
