What the hell do you need that for?  You have an obvious moment when
/sys/kernel/slab/cache_name -> <whatever> should be gone - it's when
you remove the slab called cache_name.  And at that point you don't
need to iterate over anything - you have the exact name, for fsck sake...
Why would you want these symlinks to stick around for longer than that?
