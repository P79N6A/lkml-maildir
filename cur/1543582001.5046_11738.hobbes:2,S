 That's unrelated -- duplicate reservations are due to the MP table being
located in memory areas marked as "reserved" (ROM, ususally) in the map. 
Thus the area is never freed in the first place and when smp_scan_config()
calls reserve_bootmem() for the pages a warning is issued.  Harmless,
indeed.
