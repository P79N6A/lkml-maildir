Last time it did, playing sounds and using the cardbus nic had more
problems.  But I thought IRQ allocation would use first available before
sharing.  irq 3,9,11 are available on this laptop before inserting the card.
Are there any utilities that can be used to change the IRQ of pci devices? 
I realize they won't stick if changing the IRQ at runtime is possible.
