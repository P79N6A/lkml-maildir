ext3 directory entries are always multiples of 4 bytes in length.  So
the lowest 2 bits of the offset are always zero.  Right?  Why not shift
the returned offset and f_pos 2 bits right?
JFS uses an index into an array for the position (which isn't even in
the directory traversal order) so it can handle about 2G files in a
directory (although deleted entries aren't reused).
