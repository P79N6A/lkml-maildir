This completely bogus. readb() should be present on M68K, fix the
platform to implement readb() for MMIO, even if your MMIO readb is a
moveb instruction.
check_signature is relevant for anything with MMIO space (for example you
can legitimately want to check_signature a MAC68K Nubus ROM).
S/390 is a bit of a special case as no S/390 usage of check_signature
appears sane but equally it isn't used so you can stub it out.
