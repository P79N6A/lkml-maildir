Greetings,
I am attempting to compile a kernel module under linux-2.4.9-ac9.  This
code was last known to work under linux-2.4.2.  The kernel module in
question part of the PVFS package available from
ftp://ftp.parl.clemson.edu/pub/pvfs.
  I am using the egcs-2.91.66 that
comes with redhat 7.1.  My kernel is compiled with modversions enabled.
The compilation problem I'm seeing follows:
kgcc -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -DLINUX
-I. -Ipvfs-includes -I../pvfs/include  -c ./pvfs_mod.c -o pvfs_mod.o
/usr/include/linux/dcache.h: In function `dget':
In file included from /usr/include/linux/fs.h:19,
                 from /usr/include/linux/capability.h:17,
                 from /usr/include/linux/binfmts.h:5,

                 from pvfs_linux.h:39,
                 from ./pvfs_mod.c:26:

/usr/include/asm/pgalloc.h:127: `cpu_data_Rsmp_5fa2f521' undeclared (first

make: *** [pvfs_mod.o] Error 1
I may have boiled the problem down further by showing that the above error
can be shown by trying to compile the following simple program:
#include <linux/config.h>
#include <linux/version.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/modversions.h>
#include <linux/pagemap.h>
main() {
	printf("flaah\n");
	return(0);
}
This program compiles under 2.4.2 (modversions enabled) and fails under
2.4.5++ (modversions enabled).
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
Thank You,
-Dan Nurmi
