ok, but how AUX block KBD port? if procesor-interface works, it 
shouldn't disturb communication in any way! how it is possible that 
tests do not detect broken down port? if kernel enables it in some way 
(when disabling port from command line, KBD works ok), it should be 
detected that AUX does not work correctly and lock it somehow? can it be 
etermined by analyzing data flow? or maybe tests are not enought good, 
maybe some corelations when using both KBD and AUX exist and are not 
tested? as my keyboard works now, i'm not keen on solving this, but to 
make the world better and dominate it, some "runtime hardware failures 
handling" could be added.
