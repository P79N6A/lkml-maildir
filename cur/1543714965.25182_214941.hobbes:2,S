Gpm might be a problem in high-load situations, for two reasons:
1. gpm is another process.  The mouse moves, it takes some time before gpm
   gets to read it because the cpu is busy.  Then it pass stuff onto the
   fifo that X reads from, but now X waits for a while because so much is going on.
2. You may play with the priority of x in order to get better response, but
   this does not affect the priority of gpm.
With X reading psaux directly, you avoid some waiting.  And X may get a priority
boost for waiting for the mouse to move. With gpm this bonus goes to gpm which
may have a lot less to do with it.
