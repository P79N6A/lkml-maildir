Aah, you're right.
haji tmp # time ./a.out /dev/hda
head parked
real    0m0.421s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.001s
Immediately after that:
haji tmp # time ./a.out /dev/hda
head parked
real    0m0.001s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.001s
And then I do bit of disk reads and I get this again:
haji tmp # time ./a.out /dev/hda
head parked
real    0m0.429s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.001s
So looks like it works for me too.
