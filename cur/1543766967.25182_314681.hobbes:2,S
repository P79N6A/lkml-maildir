Subject: [PATCH] fs/Kconfig: more consistent configuration of XFS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

hello,
At the moment, the configuration interface of Filesystem is not very consistent:
- All other filesystem configurations (like Reiserfs, JFS, ext3,...)
is in fs/Kconfig, but only XFS is in a separate file fs/xfs/Kconfig
- All other filesystem configuration is processed in the same screen
(using a kind of drop-down interface), but XFS configuration is done
in a separate screen.
Here is the patch to fix the problem: it moves XFS configuration from
fs/xfs/Kconfig to fs/Kconfig, makes it to do all the configuration in
the same screen (by removing "menu" directive), and removes the
unnecessary fs/xfs/Kconfig.
This patch is against 2.6.12-rc3. Please apply.
