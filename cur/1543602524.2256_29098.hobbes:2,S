You misunderstood the problem, I think: when the line moves from one CPU
to the other (the exclusive state moves along with it), that is
_expensive_.
Even when you have a backside bus (or cache pushout content snooping)  to
allow the cacheline to move directly from one CPU to the other without
having to go through memory, that's a really expensive thing to do.
So re-aquring the lock on the same CPU is pretty much free (18 cycles for
Intel, if I remember correctly, and that's _entirely_ due to the pipeline
flush to ensure in-order execution around it).
[ Oh, just for interest I checked my P4, which has a much longer pipeline:
  the cost of an exclusive locked access is a whopping 104 cycles. But we
  already knew that the first-generation P4 does badly on many things.
  Just reading the cycle counter is apparently around 80 cycles on a P4,
  it's 32 cycles on a PIII. Looks like that also stalls the pipeline or
  something. But cpuid is _really_ horrible. Test out the attached
  program.
	PIII:
		nothing: 32 cycles
		locked add: 50 cycles
		cpuid: 170 cycles
	P4:
		nothing: 80 cycles
		locked add: 184 cycles
		cpuid: 652 cycles
   Remember: these are for the already-exclusive-cache cases. ]
What are the athlon numbers?
