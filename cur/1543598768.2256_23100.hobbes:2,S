I'm sure others have contributed to this, but depending on how much delay
you're talking about, you may be able to set a startup delay via your SCSI
BIOS (reference the settings screen showing all SCSI IDs and settings for
each) if you have an Adaptec AHA2940, I know you can do this.  Others you
may need to taste before adding seasoning.
If you don't want to, or are unable to adjust the SCSI Controller's BIOS,
you can insert a startup delay if you're using LILO, and have it wait "x"
seconds which you can adjust in tenths of seconds (50=5 seconds) and have
LILO wait before starting the kernel enough time for your drives to startup.
