yeah. I'd too suggest to call it prefetch_stack(), and not make it a 
macro & hook but something defined on all arches, with for now only ia64 
having any real code in the inline function.
i'm wondering, is the switch_stack at the same/similar place as 
next->thread_info? If yes then we could simply do a 
prefetch(next->thread_info).
