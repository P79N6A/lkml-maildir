Well, yes.  But that restriction on the namespace is no doing of
cpusets.
It's some vfs namespace restriction, which should be an orthogonal
mechanism.
Well, it's probably not orthogonal at present.  Cpusets might not yet
handle a restricted vfs name space very well.
For example the /proc/<pid>/cpuset path, giving path below /dev/cpuset
of task pid's cpuset, might not be restricted.  And the set of all CPUs
and Memory Nodes that are online, which is visible in various /proc
files, and also visible in ones top cpuset, might be inconsistent if
restricted vfs namespace mapped you to a different top cpuset.
There are probably other loose ends as well.
