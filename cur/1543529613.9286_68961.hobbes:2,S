You bet that I did.

Yeah, except that if you will look intofs/reiserfs you will see a lot of
code that was obviously unmaintained for a year or so. And interating with
VFS.
In other words, if "Nobody cares if reiserfs is totally out of sync with
VFS" is a valid position - fine. But then I'ld like to have that statement
written and signed in blood. By Hans and his team. I don't think that
such position is valid for anything included into the tree. Moreover, it
pretty much makes inclusion into the tree meaningless.
