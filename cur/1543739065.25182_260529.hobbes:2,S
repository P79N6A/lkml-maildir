I actually don't want typechecking.  Sometimes you have a device and
sometimes you have a bus.  You can get everything you want (sysdata)
from either, so there's no point in doing dev->bus when all you needed
was right there.

to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
