It wasn't deliberately ripped out, it just vanished when Eric started
his SCSI rewrite in 2.3 :-). For 2.5 I would really like the change
mentioned earlier -- make sure that no block drivers should have to
deal with any request for smaller sector sizes than their hw sector
size. For 2.4, I guess I can apply much the same fix for MO as I did
for CD-ROM.
