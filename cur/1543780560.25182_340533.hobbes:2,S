Without the parameters it has exactly zero effect on the operation of
the kernel, the algorithms and the behaviour. So something odd is afoot
if its causing gentoo breakages. Do you see this using a reasonably
trustworthy compiler suite as we've not seen it on Fedora ?
If you do does the box log any stuck IRQ's during boot without the
patch
