Good idea, however there are two potential problems that I can see.
When creating a file the UID/GID name space for the file is the same as that 
for the process.  In SE Linux the name space for files to be created does not 
intersect the name space of the processes.  This makes it much less clean 
than setfsuid().
Secondly there is the issue of a lack of atomicity.  Is there a potential for 
a signal handler to create a file between the setesid() and creat() in the 
main code?  I guess the API open_secure() could remain the same and block all 
signals for it's operation...
