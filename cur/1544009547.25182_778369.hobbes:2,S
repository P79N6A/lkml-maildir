Subject: Is the Ricoh R5C822 documentation available?

The Ricoh R5C822 card reader in my laptop includes a smart card reader 
(
http://www.ricoh.com/LSI/product_pcif/pcc/5c821/index.html
) but it 
doesn't seem supported by the kernel.
So I was wondering whether the documentation for the Ricoh card reader is 
available from somewhere (or is the sdhci support the result of reverse 
engineering?).
Ricoh told me to ask HP and HP hasn't answered at all...
