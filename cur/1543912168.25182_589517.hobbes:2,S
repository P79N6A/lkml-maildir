It is for now, but once we have a system that implements them, we'd most
probably need to change the current code, so I think it's better to consider
that in advance.

At present, during suspend and resume we always call the AML interpreter
with interrupts enabled.
Frankly, I'd like _BFS and _GTS to be executed with interrupts disabled,
just as the specification tells us to do.  If you think that's safe, I'll
change the patch to work this way.

That actually depends on which version of the ACPI specification you consider.
In ACPI 3.0 (and later) there's section 15 "Waking and Sleeping" that
describes, among other things, the supposed system start sequence (in 15.3.3).
It clearly states that we're supposed to check if ACPI is enabled (and enable
if not), only _after_ the hibernation image has been loaded.  After that, in
turn, we should execute _BFS and subsequently _WAK, so my interpretation is
that we should not execute any ACPI methods before that point.
Anyway, however, if the user passes acpi=off to the boot kernel, ACPI may not
be enabled until the image kernel gets control.  Thus, it should always check
if ACPI is enabled (and enable it, if need be) before doing anything
ACPI-related and that should happen before the nonboot CPUs are enabled.
Preferrably, with interrupts off, as that should be done before we attempt to
execute _BFS.

Rafael
