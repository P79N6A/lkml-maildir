Sure it is. But the hunk above is from patch-2.3.15. And in result we
have insane code in sb_ess.c! 2 identical switch statements,
except that one of choises is commented out.
We can safely remove second switch, and a commend in the first
(if you tell me that it works for some people this way).
*And* specify in documentation, that if ESS1869 plays sounds too
slow, then specify 'esstype=-1' as module parameter to sb.o
        /* AAS: info stolen from ALSA: these boards have different clocks */
        switch(devc->submodel) {
/* APPARENTLY NOT 1869
                case SUBMDL_ES1869:
*/
                case SUBMDL_ES1887:
                case SUBMDL_ES1888:
                        devc->caps |= SB_CAP_ES18XX_RATE;
                        break;
        }
        /* AAS: info stolen from ALSA: these boards have different clocks */
        switch(devc->submodel) {
                case SUBMDL_ES1869:
                case SUBMDL_ES1887:
                case SUBMDL_ES1888:
                        devc->caps |= SB_CAP_ES18XX_RATE;
                        break;
        }

Why not make parameter, then? e.g ess1968=slow/fast?
It only makes sence if one board does not swith behaviour while
in the one PC only.
Bye,
