Hi,
The git tree from yesterday and as of right now doesn't suspend on my
laptop. It does it's regular thing, then hits:
[...]
Stopping tasks:
===========================================================================================|
eth1: Going into suspend...
Class driver suspend failed for cpu0
Could not power down device `×1x: error -22
Some devices failed to power down
Incidentally, /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/ is also empty on this
kernel. Some new magic option that needs to be enabled? Not suspending
sucks, cpufreq not working sucks as well (I'm stuck on 800MHz).
