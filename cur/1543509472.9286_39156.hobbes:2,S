You are missing the point...

The point is that this _already works_.  You get the fd in the
siginfo's si_fd struct.  What is missing right now is poll band
information for si_band, but there are patches pending for that.

Completion ports also don't implement things like child death
notification until you implement child death notification completion
ports.  :)  We already have a working model: if you want to add more
completion events, then feel free to do so.  You don't need to invent
a new delivery mechanism.

That is what happens today.  We already have that model.  That is what
F_SETSIG does.

I already implemented it --- it is in 2.2.
