Andre,
Is there any chance you will backport the Promise ATA/133
patch to the 2.2 kernel series?  If not, is anyone you
know of working on a backport?
I've got a pair of 160GB Maxtors I'd like to get working
soon, perhaps without rolling the office forward to the 2.4
kernel... :)  I guess my alternative to finding a 2.2 patch
somewhere is just using the first 137 GB of the drives, and
extending the partition and ext2 filesystem later when we
finally upgrade our kernels.
