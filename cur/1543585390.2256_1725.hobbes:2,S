"correctly".  Intel doesn't support this (mis)configuration:
especially with different steppings, not to mention models.
Alan has, or is working on, a workaround to handle differing 
multipliers by turning off the use of RDTSC.  this is the right approach 
to take in the kernel: disable features not shared by both processors, 
so correctly-configured machines are not penalized. 
and the kernel should LOUDLY WARN ABOUT this stuff on boot.
