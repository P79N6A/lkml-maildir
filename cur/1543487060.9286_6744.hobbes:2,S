Subject: quota problems with RAID

I have a machine running software raid-1 which previously was running
2.1.119 and which I recently upgraded to 2.2.1 after failing to get
quota support working.
In 2.1.119, any attempt to turn quotas on on one of the /dev/md?
filesystems would result in a 'Invalid Entry' error message from quotaon
and edquota would not report the filesystem as having quotas.
Now with 2.2.1, some limited quota support appears to be present. When
the same quotaon command is issued, the Invalid Entry error message
appears again, but edquota shows the device and allows quotas to be set.
When this happens the quota information appears (via repquota) to be
being updated intermittently.
Any attempt to run the quotacheck program on one of these filesystems
results in an immediate hang (process moves into DW state) and then any
other quota-system-control program run also disappears into this state.
This is not (I hope) a problem with quotacheck taking a vey long time to
run, as I have a test 10Mb RAID-1 volume which exhibits exactly the same
behaviour.
Is this a known or a new problem, or have I discovered a hitherto
unknown set of circumstances?
(kernels 2.1.119 and 2.2.1, raidtools 0.42 and quota 1.65 on a debian
(mostly hamm) machine)
