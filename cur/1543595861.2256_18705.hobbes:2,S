We seem to have come full circle.  My original question was about
providing a better way for sockets applications to take advantage of
SAN hardware.  W2K Datacenter introduces "Winsock Direct," which will
bypass the protocol stack when appropriate.  The Infiniband people are
working on a "Sockets Direct" standard, which is a similar idea.  No
one seems to care about this for Linux.
