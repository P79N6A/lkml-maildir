Please submit patches inline, having to copy them from attachments to
be able to reply is a pain.

I really liked the old code better. If in the future
init_srcu_struct() is changed to also return >0 for some conditions,
then that would not previously have triggered BUG(), but after your
changes it will. The code, as it were, perfectly expressed what it
wanted to happen - if it returns less than zero it's a BUG().
I say leave it alone.
