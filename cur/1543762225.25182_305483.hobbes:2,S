dear sir 
i want to call my own function inside the kernel 
after a fixed interval(i.e some kind of timer)
how to do that which function i have to use to 
repeat the function
anather way is that making my own system call 
which calls my function and 
this sytem call is being access by a user program
which calls it after a fixed inter val of time
 will this be correct
thanks 
sounak
