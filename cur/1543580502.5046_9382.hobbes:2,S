My /etc/modutils/devfsd has
probeall  /dev/discs            scsi-hosts sd_mod ide-probe-mod ide-disk DAC960
perhaps it should have something similar for /dev/hd*?
As a work around, put something like this:
alias /dev/hdd         ide-cd
or (not tested; just guessing):
alias /dev/hd* /dev/ide
in /etc/modutils/aliases, and run update-modules.

I am not really familiar with USB.
