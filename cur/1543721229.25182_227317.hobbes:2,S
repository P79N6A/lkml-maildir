A co-worker had a very similar problem with eepro100 when I switched his
computer from 100 Mbps fullduplex switch to 10Mbps halfduplex hub. The
problems went away with e100 driver. It was with a revent kernel about a
month ago but I don't remeber whether it was a recent 2.4 or a recent
2.6 kernel. The NIC in question is the onboard NIC of Intel D815EEA2
mainboard.
