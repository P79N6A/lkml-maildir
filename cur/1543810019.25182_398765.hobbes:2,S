Hmm... The problem here is that the server is returning an unexpected
error: it is normally supposed to return "lock granted" or "grace
error", but is actually returning "stale filehandle".
Anyhow, the client should be able to deal with this without Oopsing.
The attached patch ought to fix that. Please could you give it a try?
Cheers,

NLM: Ensure we do not Oops in the case of an unlock
In theory, NLM specs assure us that the server will only reply LCK_GRANTED
or LCK_DENIED_GRACE_PERIOD to our NLM_UNLOCK request.
In practice, we should not assume this to be the case, and the code will
currently Oops if we do.
