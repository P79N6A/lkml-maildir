I'm not. But the kernel does not boot with gdth and scsi as modules when
there is no the MO diskette in a MO drive hooked to the GDT6117RP. The
following patch DOES allow the beast to boot:

It does not crash. The "cat /dev/scsi/gdth/0" still oopses on a first run.
The kernel does survive the oops and I'm able to catch it. The next cat's do
show an incomplete info (no more oopses) :

Alas... I did recompile kernel with DEBUG_SPINLOCKS but I'm unable to boot
it - there a whole lot of unresolved symbols in scsi modules so the root fs
can't be mounted...

It'd be very good. But I don't know how to help you any further...
Unfortunately, I don't have a line printer around to use an lp console...
BTW, reboot does also crash the kernel so the reboot procedure doesn't
complete (all fs'es are unmounted, all processes are killed, kernel says
something kinda "Rebooting the system" and whoila - oops, segmentation fault
on running reboot)...
About the gdth driver - it seems that 2.3.35preX contains the very same
driver that my working 2.2.10-ac10 does (1.14). I doubt that 2.2.x kernel
modules are well suited for a 2.3.xx, that it could also be a source of the
problem. As one can see the last revision mark and comment in the gdth
source is:
=== Cut ===
 * Tested with Linux 1.2.13, ..., 2.2.4                                 *
 *                                                                      *
 * $Log: gdth.c,v $
 * Revision 1.23  1999/03/26 09:12:31  achim
=== Cut ===
Yes, the 2.2.10 and 2.3.35preX gdth sources do differ, but I suspect that
the driver has not being modified by the ICP-Vortex itself 'coz the revision
mark is not changed. There is no also any sign of life from achim - the
messages seems to go into the black hole... Does it mean that ICP-Vortex did
abandon to develop their drivers for Linux? May be all of GDTxxx owners are
doomed and they'd better exchange these otherwise very good controllers for
something else which IS supported? It'd be a pain in the ass to do so...
