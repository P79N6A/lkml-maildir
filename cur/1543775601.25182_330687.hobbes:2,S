That would really be a loss.
After some thinking, the whole "not allowing namespace differences
based on user id" philosophy is unenforcable and not even true sometimes
nowadays. Think NFS: have a look at the unfsd server, you'll be surprised
what it can do. Think any other networked file system exported by a
machine with an unusual disk file-system underneath. IIRC ncpfs does
this on the server based on access and thus based on uid.
(hmm, I _hated_ it seeing empty directories only because I had no access
 to anything below. Based on that I'd prefer EACCES instead of seeing an
 empty mount stub when FUSE denies access to root or any other user.)
The thing is, root rules the _local_ part of the name space. So it should
make a _huge_ difference if FUSE can fiddle with that or only with what's
below the leaf nodes.

It is _defined_ behavior. So, it is up to the quality of the programmer
whether or not it results in a security problem ;-)
