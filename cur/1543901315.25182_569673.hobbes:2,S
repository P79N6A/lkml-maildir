It has code like
	+       /* Can deadlock when called with interrupts disabled */
	+       WARN_ON(irqs_disabled());
	+
	        /* prevent preemption and reschedule on another processor */
	        int me = get_cpu();
which is against the coding conventions (and shouldn't even compile 
cleanly - but maybe we don't have the "warn about C99 variable 
declarations" thng on?).
Please don't do that.
