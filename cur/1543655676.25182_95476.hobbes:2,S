I support this, it makes all kernel-space debug tools less intrusive. 
It may be out of scope for this work but there are a couple of
other issues to consider here:
- turn trap1/trap3 to interrupt gates: kprobes does this, kgdb turns
  off interrupts in its own handler, I suppose other tools too need
  this.
- notifier lists are racy on SMP, IFAICT, read_lock(&notifier_lock)
  needs to be taken in notifier_call_chain(), but that too is 
  deadlock prone.
Andi,
Isn't this a problem on x86_64 too? What is there to prevent a
handler from being removed from the notifier list while it
is being used to call the handler on another CPU?
I am considering using a RCU-based list for notifier chains.
Corey has done some work on these lines to add NMI notifier
chain, I think it should be generalised on for all notifiers.
Thoughts? Comments?
