Yea I found a beta 1.28 bios and that fixed the detection problem, but it 
still does not count as enabled in Linux.

It is of course on. And I cannot turn it on as you usually can with 
hdparm. Maybe the problem lies on the machine - it is an old 
dell poweredge dual p2 with an eisa-chipset. I tried all 3 PCI-slots it 
had but no difference. Maybe the dell bios does not enable it or 
does not support busmastering or something alike?
Usually the HPT366 driver reports ide3: <addresses etc> but this time it 
only reports ide3: disabled by bios.
Thanks for your help!
