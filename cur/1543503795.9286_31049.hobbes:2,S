It is not only matter of ld, because the compiler must at least indicate the
size of the .rodata strings. With const objects which go into .rodata you
have .size, but not with strings. Assembler would have to keep those .L*
symbols for .rodata objects and rip them off during the final link after all
identical .rodata objects have been merged using some hash table.
