I just commented out that offending line, as I do not have Pinnacle,
so it should be never executed ;-)
If you have Pinnacle, then you'll have to get tda9887 driver somewhere.
This driver defines AUD_CONFIG_PINNACLE (as far as I can tell from
missing pieces...).
AFAIK bttv driver at 
http://bytesex.org/bttv
 has this fixed.
