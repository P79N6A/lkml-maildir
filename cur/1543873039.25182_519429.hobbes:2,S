Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Remove OPEN_MAX
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/13/75

The OPEN_MAX macro in limits.h should not be there.  It claims to be the
limit on file descriptors in a process, but its value is wrong for that.
There is no constant value, but a variable resource limit (RLIMIT_NOFILE).
Nothing in the kernel uses OPEN_MAX except things that are wrong to do so.
I've submitted other patches to remove those uses.
The proper thing to do according to POSIX is not to define OPEN_MAX at all.
The sysconf (_SC_OPEN_MAX) implementation works by calling getrlimit.
