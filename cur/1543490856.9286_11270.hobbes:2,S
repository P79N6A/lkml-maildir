I, too am an Impact IQ owner.  It is a VERY NICE ISDN adapter.
The problem lies not in the kernel, but in PPPd 2.3.
I can get dual channel ISDN on ppp-2.2.0, but options changed in 2.3, and
not one single person I know has been able to get this combo working.
I have not gone into the pppd source, since it is not a major issue for me,
but if you get it fixed, I know a great many people who will thank you.
Good Luck
Tim
p.s. - I just stayed with 2.2.0 - <shrug>
