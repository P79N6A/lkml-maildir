Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: fix dma_alloc_pages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/19/102

one system with two nodes and two ht links on every node.
the bios already have _pxm for two links.
when no ram installed for node1 will have panic.
reason: the device on second chain will get node = 1 from dev_to_node...via
pci_acpi_scan_root.
but node1 doesn't have ram installed.
in dma_alloc_pages it will pass check with first_node(node_online_map)...
and will have problem with __alloc_pages in alloc_pages_node.
this patch will check the if the node is online..., if not will get numa_node_id
to get one node with ram.
