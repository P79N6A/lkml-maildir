Hi, 
I'm trying to debug why my firewire harddrive is no longer handled by
'hald', and it seems that the value in /sys/block/sdb/device/type is 14
(0x0e) and this is not a value handled by the program.  It is expecting
0x00 for disk and 0x05 for cdrom. 
In the hald source (blockdev.c), there is a comment:
    /* These magic values are documented in the kernel source */
and for the life of me I cannot find out where.  You can't exactly grep
for 0x0e and get anything meaningful! 
Does anyone know?
BTW, I'm running the FC4 kernel: 2.6.15-1.1830_FC4 on ia32, if that
matters.
