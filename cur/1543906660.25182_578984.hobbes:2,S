not just Linus, but neither me nor Nick Piggin, nor a ton of other 
kernel hackers agree with that idea, for numerous technical reasons,
as it has been discussed to death already ;-)
and the last but not least point, although they might sound pretty 
similar, there is quite a bit of difference between "IO schedulers" and 
"CPU schedulers", just like there is quite a bit of difference between 
"Paris Hilton" and "The Hilton, Paris" =B-)
