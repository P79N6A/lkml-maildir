Hi Roland,
I haven't tested what is the behavior with my patch, or without any 
patches at all (will do), but with your patch applied, when I run the test 
program under strace, it resumes immediately ... doesn't look particularly 
OK to me:
$ strace -o /dev/null ./a.out | head -10
finished (without SIGCONT)
finished (without SIGCONT)
finished (without SIGCONT)
finished (without SIGCONT)
finished (without SIGCONT)
finished (without SIGCONT)
finished (without SIGCONT)
finished (without SIGCONT)
finished (without SIGCONT)
finished (without SIGCONT)
