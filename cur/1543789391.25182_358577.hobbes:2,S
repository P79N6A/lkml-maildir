Nope, it elides critical logic.
1) The quirk should not be enabled if IDE driver is a module.  No reason 
to perform the nasty hack at all, as the user controls module load order.
2) The quirk should not be enabled if IDE driver is not built at all. 
Standard resource reservation code works as expected here.
3) The quirk should not be enabled if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_SATA is 
enabled, which indicates that the IDE driver gets preference for the 
Intel SATA hardware in question.

My patch works fine when ahci/piix is compiled as a module.  That's the 
configuration I personally tested.

It is.  I wrote 100% of the code, and further, the quirk specifically 
enumerates which PCI IDs are affected, making it easy to verify.
