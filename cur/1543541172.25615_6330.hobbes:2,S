I think there's something wrong with this analysis. That bit isn't
appearing out of thin air, it's coming out of the pool. If the attacker
knew all the inputs to the pool, he'd know that bit as well. So this is
zero new bits. Otherwise, we could recursively generate arbitrary amounts
of entropy by calling the PRNG!
