VFS abstraction is not too limiting, because the interface to user space is
fixed by posix or other standards in the libc. So als long as the new
filesystem want to support that semantic, it is not really limited.
There are some cases which are a bit hard, for example inode numbers -
especially when you want to provice NFS support, but that is not
specifically a VFS Problem.
And: VFS has evolved over time, that is the advantage of open source, you
can just include new functions in the old filesystems when you think you
need to impriove the framework.
That said, if you look at Reiser4 for example, there are some plug-in
extensions which are not yet possible in VFS, since it is a more high level
interface...
There are some different file close/lock semantics out there, and VFS does
not even try to abstract them.
