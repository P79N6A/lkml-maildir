This is actually really well-defined in C, not fuzzy at all.
"Volatile accesses" are a side effect, and no side effects can
be reordered with respect to sequence points.  The side effects
that matter in the kernel environment are: 1) accessing a volatile
object; 2) modifying an object; 3) volatile asm(); 4) calling a
function that does any of these.
We certainly should avoid volatile whenever possible, but "because
it's fuzzy wrt reordering" is not a reason -- all alternatives have
exactly the same issues.
