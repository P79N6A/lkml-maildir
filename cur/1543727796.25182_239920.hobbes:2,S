I bet it is (unless it falls into generic filepage overheads
which shmem is skating past e.g. attempts to readahead).
Though I hope not notably more so by the time I've finished
reworking shmem_getpage (was on the right track yesterday,
but other issues have intervened today).
They should both come down to find_get_page (find_lock_page in
shmem.c's case, only an issue when contention on same page),
alloc_page, add_to_page_cache: contention on tree_lock.
Its main deficiency (aside from the lack of swap use, which in
some contexts is a plus) is its lack of resource limiting.
