Yeah that is probably what he meant.

Because even with an allyesconfig, your compile isn't testing the
entire kernel. So given the relatively minor benefit of removing
the volatiles, I suppose we shouldn't risk slipping a bug in. If
you can make gcc throw an error in that case it would be a different
story.
