You got me curious enough to try it.  It compiles and links fine with
-O1 and higher under
       gcc version 2.95.2 20000220 (Debian GNU/Linux)
       gcc version 2.8.1
       gcc version 2.7.2.3

One CAN rely on this behaviour so long as branch reduction (well,
whatever it's called) is an optimizing step following constant
expression evaluation.  The fn call will never make it outside of gcc's
internal repreentation.
