So you have to have a copy of the written offer to request the source 
code.  Anyone who gives out the binary must also give out that same 
written offer, so you may have sold it to Anne, who gave it to Bob, who 
gave it to Charles, who came to you with the written offer.  You would 
be required to give Charles the source code.  If Anne also came with the 
written offer, you'd give it to her as well.  But you would not have to 
give it to Diane if she does not have the written offer.
