Which reminds me...you were talking about a patch that adds oneshot
support for the count/compare clocksource and more cleanups, but I
don't think I've seen it...?
I've probably messed things up enough that it won't apply cleanly
anymore, but if you just send me what you have, I'll rebase and fold it
as necessary.

Right. I think I've got both those patches.

Right. I just want to get everything properly queued up before the
merge window opens.

Sure, but a bit more exposure won't hurt.

Assuming the tclib stuff comes first, yes. I'm not worried about me
having to deal with conflicts, I'm worried about Andrew or Stephen
having to fix up my mess.

Right. I was just mentioning it as one option.

Yes, getting the fundamental stuff into mainline now would help a lot.
But I was thinking about Linus' suggestions that we exploit the
distributed nature of git and do cross-tree merges to synchronize
changes to common code.
Setting up a separate git tree would allow the changes to go into the
arm tree without littering it with possibly unstable avr32 changes as
well, and it would allow me to merge them and put more stuff on top.
And if the patches are ready for mainline, there should be no need to
fix up the history of the "tclib" tree later, so it should be perfectly
safe to merge into several trees (assuming those trees don't rebase and
make them appear as different commits.)

Which goes nicely along with my priority of reducing the overall power
consumption on avr32 :)

Yeah, I didn't actually check how many TC blocks are planned on other
chips. I just want this to be a bit future-proof.

I don't entirely agree. Most drivers I've dealt with can handle an
arbitrary number of devices. I don't see why this one should be
different.

Right, that's why it's probably best to change it now rather than later.

No, I have no problems with that.

I'm suggesting that the mid-layer returns a nice struct with all the
information that the driver needs. atmel_tc_alloc() already returns two
separate values, and it might be useful to provide even more.
As an added bonus, the struct may contain a list_head so that we can
support an arbitrary number of devices as well.

I'm not suggesting we change the platform interface. That part looks
good to me.

Good point.

I've never really seen the point of indenting those defines at all.

I thought about that, but while the driver can safely call clk_enable()
on the same clock several times, I'm not sure if it's such a great idea
to call request_irq() on the same interrupt several times. So the
driver probably needs to know how many irqs there really are and might
as well use platform_get_irq() to find out.

I can do that.
It's getting late around here...I'll reply to your other mail tomorrow.
