Though not as useful as a libata driver (and not GPL, though the license
is entirely unrestrictive), there is an open source driver for the
Marvell chipsets:
http://www.highpoint-tech.com/BIOS
%20%2B%20Driver/rr1820a/Linux/rr182x-openbuild-v1.02.tgz
It wont build on 2.6 due to cli/sti (v. easy to fix though - its just
the irq locking), and it only supports 8 channel chips (only a few
#defines for PCI ids and number of ports). Intend to fix it up and test
it next week if the libata driver not out, as I have a few of these. The
highpoint card is the first PCI-X SATA card I have actually managed to
get hold of, but unlike other highpoint cards is not their chipset:
03:02.0 SCSI storage controller: Marvell MV88SX5081 8-port SATA I PCI-X
Controller (rev 03)
