Subject: builtin module aliases in 2.6.0-test11 - non-working MODULE_ALIAS_BLOCKDEV_MAJOR?

As I see after upgrade to test11 MODULE_ALIAS_CHARDEV_MAJOR has just
begun to work without modprobe.conf entries - but
MODULE_ALIAS_BLOCKDEV_MAJOR hasn't.
At least for floppy module - there is:
MODULE_ALIAS_BLOCKDEV_MAJOR(FLOPPY_MAJOR);
and it means:
$ /sbin/modinfo -F alias floppy
block-major-2-*
But accessing /dev/fd0 still causes modprobe block-major-2, which fails
without block-major-2 alias in /etc/modprobe.conf...
BTW, maybe it would be good to build in some modules more aliases which
seem constant?
I mean (from my modprobe.conf):
alias ppp-compress-21   bsd_comp
alias ppp-compress-24   ppp_deflate
alias ppp-compress-26   ppp_deflate
alias iso9660           isofs
alias block-major-11    sr_mod
alias char-major-21     sg
