I am having similar lockups with 2.2.12, 2.2.13pre[8,9], etc.
The messages I typically get are:
EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,33):  ext2_new_block:  Free blocks count
corrupted
   for block group 235  [only appears on the Dell sometimes]
and when NFS locks up I get:
nfs_dentry_delete:  //xfer:  ino=<some number>, count=2, nlink=2
About all I can do is get a dump with the SYSRQ keys.  NFS seems
to be locked up in fs/nfs/inode.c:  nfs_free_dentries()

My problem crops up when I am NFS copying 1G of files from from box A to
box B and 1G from box B to box A, all via 100-T.  Then I execute the
following on either box (e.g., box A):
 
  on box A:
    cd <some dir on NFS mounted directory box B>
    mkdir testfiles
    cp <some files> testfiles
    in a loop, do:
      ln -s testfiles testfiles-1
      ls testfiles* 
      rm testfiles-1
      mv testfiles testfiles-1
      ln -s testfiles-1 testfiles
      ls testfiles*
      rm testfiles
      mv testfiles-1 testfiles
    enddo
System:  
  Penguin dual PIII, RedHat 6.0, 
  Dell WS 400 dual  PII/300, RedHat 6.0
both are SMP boxes with 2.2.12, 2.2.13pre8, 2.2.13pre9, and 2.2.13pre9+
Andrea's patches (almost pre10) including ikd.  
I have been working with Alan Cox and Andrea Arcangeli on this issue.
If anyone has any similar lockups or other info, please share it 
with us....
Cheers,
