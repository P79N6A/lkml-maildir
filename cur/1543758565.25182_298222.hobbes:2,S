Well, you'll run into trouble with all drivers that use a non-standard
fb_imageblit, i.e.:
amifb
cirrusfb
cyber2000fb
hgafb
neofb
tdfxfb
tgafb
vga16fb
atyfb
radeon_accel
i810
intelfb
matroxfb_accel
riva
savage
Hmm, maybe I should change the vesafb test in the bootsplash code
to test if fb_imageblit == cfb_imageblit. This would make Pavel
very happy, I guess ;-)
Cheers,
  Michael.
