I've built versions of gcc 2.7 and egcs hundreds of times and it's never
'screwed up my system'.

Bollocks.
Versions of gcc and egcs install into separate directories, under 
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/<arch>/<gcc-version>, so they won't interfere with each
other. To use a different gcc version just use the -V switch. All I do is
change /usr/src/linux/Makefile to:
CFLAGS = -V2.7.2.3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
And it gets built with gcc 2.7.2.3 instead of egcs.
If you're not prepared to spend a little time getting your compilers set
up properly as opposed to installing them from your distribution, I don't see
why you expect to compile your own kernel, instead of installing that from
your distribution.
