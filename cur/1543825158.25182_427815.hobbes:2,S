Hi Guys,
Kernel 2.6.15 issue:
	I am trying to install 2 x quad NICs,with Intel chipset 
	into PCI-X slots on Super Micro board H8DC8, With NVIDIA
chipset.
	When booting, there is no probing on the kernel for those cards,
and there are no interfaces.
	When using grub with the option acpi=off, it works.
Kernel 2.6.11.6 - same server, works fine, and I can load the e1000
drivers for the cards.
Both kernel have very similar .config, and both enabled acpi.
cat /proc/interrupts shows irq 9 is sharing acpi and the e1000 drives
Can anyone tell me what is wrong?
Thank you,
Sion
