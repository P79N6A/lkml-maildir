Hi guys,
I some code on top of the writepage for all io patch (2.4.2 timeframe),
that implemented getblk_mapping, get_hash_table_mapping and bread_mapping,
which gave the same features as the original but took an address space as
one of the args.  
The idea is more or less what has been discussed, but it did assume one
blocksize per mapping.  Of course, set_blocksize and invalidate_buffers
were on the todo list ;-)  The only other gotcha was calling
filemap_fdatasync and truncate_inode_pages in put_super, to make sure
things got flushed right.
Anyway, the whole thing can be cut down to a smallish patch, either alone
or on top of andrea's stuff.  Daniel, if you want to work together on it,
I'm game.
