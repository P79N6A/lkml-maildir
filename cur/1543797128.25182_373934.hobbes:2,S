My first instinct was to introduce functions like get_user_pid() and
get_kernel_pid() which would effectively introduce the same split.
Doing that, we could keep from even referencing ->user_pid in normal
code, and keep things small and simpler for people like the embedded
folks.
For the particular application that we're thinking of, we really don't
want "user pid" and "kernel pid" we want "virtualized" and
"unvirtualized", or "regular old pid" and "fancy new virtualized pid".
So, like in the global pidspace (which can see all pids and appears to
applications to be just like normal) you end up returning "kernel" pids
to userspace.  That didn't seem to make sense.
