I would suggest not trying this out as your first patch conflict fix
attempt.  Both xfs and ac are large and touch a bunch of core linux
files.  Getting xfs to apply on top of ac requires an intimate knowledge
of the xfs (and some ac) code.  If you are interested in trying out, see
how it was done for the 2.4.3-SGI_XFS_1.0.1 rpm that SGI put out for
xfs-enabled redhat 7.1.
If you download the src.rpm from oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs, you will find
an xfs patch that applies on an ac patch.  Now, both xfs and ac have
changed a bunch from the 2.4.3 days, but this will give you a good start
at figuring out what was done to get the two to play nice together.
