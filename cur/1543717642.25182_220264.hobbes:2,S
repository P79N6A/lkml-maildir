Sorry to take so long to get back.
The patches have been at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/raven
for a while.
There is one for 2.6.0 and the 2.6.4 one caters a change that was made.
The autofs4-2.6.6-rc3-mm2-compat_ioctls.patch is to update the 32 <-> 
64 bit ioctl emulation and should apply with a small offset.
