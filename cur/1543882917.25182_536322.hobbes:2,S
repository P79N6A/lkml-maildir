We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.20.10 kernel.
This release has two bugfixes that fix the fixes that were in 2.6.20.8
and 2.6.20.9.  We are sorry for the constant stream of releases, but
these are security issues and as such, sometimes it is better to err on
the side of quicker updates rather than an expanded window of
vulnerability.
Many thanks go out to the networking kernel developers who resolved
these issues faster than seemed imaginable.
Anyone who uses ipv4 or ipv6 and a 2.6.20 based kernel release is
strongly encouraged to upgrade.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.20.9 and 2.6.20.10.
The updated 2.6.20.y git tree can be found at:
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.20.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
        www.kernel.org/git/
thanks,
greg k-h
