Hello Greg,
thank you for your comments. Just a few follow-up questions.

This turns out to be surprisingly tricky, as these macros take a device
pointer argument which mustn't be NULL either.
Could you please advise how to use these when I do not have a device
pointer available (ie. before the probe method has been called) or when
there is a risk of it being no longer valid (ie. the USB device has been
unplugged)? I can detect both cases by checking for dev==NULL, but then
what do I do if it is? Is there a dummy device structure somewhere which
I could then use instead? Somehow, replacing all our occurrences of
	info("m%sg", args);
with
	if (cs->dev)
		dev_info(cs->dev, "m%sg\n", args);
	else
		printk(KERN_INFO "gigaset: m%sg\n", args);
doesn't really appeal to me. :-)
Thanks
Tilman
