Just like done in the x86-64 patch that I just sent, I'd recommend
moving
the push added yesterday outside of the CFI-covered region (so that
in the unlikely event of being caught at the push there won't be an
ill
assumption that a [fake] return address is already on the stack, or
that
there is a return address at all):
ENTRY(kernel_thread_helper)
	pushl $0			# fake return address
	CFI_STARTPROC
	movl %edx,%eax
	pushl %edx
	CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET 4
	call *%ebx
	pushl %eax
	CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET 4
	call do_exit
	CFI_ENDPROC
ENDPROC(kernel_thread_helper)
