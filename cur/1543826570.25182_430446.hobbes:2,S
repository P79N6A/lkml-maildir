Which part of PPS doesn't work on 2.6 if you have the PPS-kit-light
installed?  There is a version for 2.6.15 around, which applies to
2.6.16 with minimal fixing.  Only problem I found so far with the code
was that it breaks the serial console on my system, but that was easy to
fix.  I still have to test it though since my serial port has the CD
line stuck high at the moment until I can get the board fixed, so
testing is a bit tricky.
I know I have run a gps receiver with PPS on the CD line under 2.6.8
using PPS-kit-light, and it worked rather well.
