Hello!
Someone once said the kernel doesn't need proper symbolic links to be 
set up for include files. Unfortunately this is not alwys true:
cd /usr/src/linux22-PPS/
make bzImage
make: *** No rule to make target 
`/usr/src/linux/include/asm/param.h', needed by 
`/usr/src/linux/include/linux/sched.h'.  Stop.
Compilation exited abnormally with code 2 at Thu Feb 18 19:46:47
Can't "./include" be used instead of "/usr/src/linux/include"? If you 
have several trees in parallel this is nasty. Despite of that "make 
kernel/time.o" worked even without the link.
Another issue:
I can "make kernel/time.o", but I can't "make kernel/kernel.o" (all 
objects in the library), nor can I "make kernel". When hunting for 
syntax and other stupid errors, you don't want all the rest to be 
compiled until you have fixed the most stupid bugs.
Finally I had forgotten to export one new symbol in kernel/ksyms.c. 
After ading it, make decided to do a full rebuild. Knowing better, I 
just mad a "make -t bzImage", and then removed the objects affected. 
When I re-started "make bzImage" all the directories were processed, 
and files were compiled, but no kernel was made! Only after removing 
vmlinux it was rebuilt. I guess there is some bad dependency inside.
Regards,
ulrich
P.S: Soon more...
