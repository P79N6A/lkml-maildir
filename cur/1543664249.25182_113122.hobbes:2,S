... you could do the same with /etc/mtab.
In fact since /etc is almost guaranteed to be on the same filesystem as
/, it seems like "/mtab.d" offers zero advantages over just /etc/mtab --
the case where /etc/mtab is the most annoying is when /etc is R/O, but
this almost always means that / will be R/O, making /mtab.d useless too.

It uses /etc/fstab.

Unless you use the `-n' flag, which an init-script should do if it
knows there's something wierd required to get /var mounted or something.
