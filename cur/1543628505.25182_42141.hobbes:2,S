From a brief perusal of the code, it looks like the commands map to basic 
operations on NAND flash - read/write/erase commands?

That definitely sounds like you're dealing with raw NAND flash chips - 
512 bytes with 16 bytes of 'spare' area - albeit through a _very_ 
strange interface.
If we have to write code to handle the actual SmartMedia translation layer,
which does translation of logical addresses to physical addresses for reads
and handles safely writing the data to a new address before updating the
metadata and possibly erasing old versions of the replaced logical sector,
etc, then we should make sure it works with both the USB readers and the 
raw flash chips.
