Yes, this sounds reasonable.  I wasn't very clear on this point, but
"by going south" I meant that TCP is starting to misbehave.  In
particular, you'll likely end up with the kernel aborting ESTABLISHED
TCP connections with extreme prejudice (and in violation of the TCP
protocol), because it thought that it had been unable to communicate
with the remote end for a _very_ long time.  The net effect typically
is that you end up with one end having a connection that's in the
ESTABLISHED state and the other end having no trace of that
connection.
