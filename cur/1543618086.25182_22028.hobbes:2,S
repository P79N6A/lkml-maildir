I've also seen:
127.0.0.1 sent an invalid ICMP error to a broadcast.
from the ipv4 stack after fixing these as per the Andi's patch.  I'm not
certain what's causing it; it only happens while the box is coming up.
In addition, there was another case in the icmp6 code that Andi confirmed
last night:

 		return 1;
 	return (optval&0xC0) == 0x80;
(another mail will be following this one with another patch...)
