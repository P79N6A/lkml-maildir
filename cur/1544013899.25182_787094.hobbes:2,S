Hmm. Ok, granted.

rcu_dereference() does more than that smp_read_barrier_depends() (which is 
a no-op on all sane architectures). 
The important part of rcu_dereference() is the ACCESS_ONCE() part. That's 
the one that guarantees the access to happen - exactly once.

No, _you_ miss the subtlety of something that can change under you.
Look at radix_tree_deref_slot(), and realize that without the 
rcu_dereference(), the compiler would actually be allowed to think that it 
can re-load anything from *pslot several times. So without my one-liner 
patch, the compiler can actually do this:
	register = load_from_memory(pslot)
	if (radix_tree_is_indirect_ptr(register))
		goto fail:
	return load_from_memory(pslot);
   fail:
	return RADIX_TREE_RETRY;
see? Imagine if you are low on registers (x86, anyone?) and look at that 
radix_tree_is_indirect_ptr() test: it does a logical "and" which can be 
done with a memory instruction on x86. So the compiler could _literally_ 
compile this as
	testb $1,(%eax)		; %eax is "pslot"
	jne indirect_pointer
	movl (%eax),%eax	; now we load it for real
rather than
	movl (%eax),%eax
	testl $1,%eax
	jne indirect_pointer
because the first version actually keeps more registers live for the 
indirect case. In fact, the compiler might be delaying that "movl" until 
much later (depending on barriers and needs). And notice how that "now we 
load it for real" may be getting a new value - including a possible 
indirect pointer value, even though we tested that it wasn't an indirect 
pointer!
And THIS is why code that depends on RCU needs to use "rcu_dereference()". 
Because otherwise you may be testing one thing, and then later using some 
_other_ value than the one you tested. You must guarantee that you really 
just load it once, and that the compiler doesn't decide that it can load 
it multiple times, and test the multiple (possibly different) values using 
different logic.

Not relevant.
Yes, when it fails, the caller can obviously assume that the pointer has 
almost certainly changed, but that's neither here nor there - if the 
page_cache_get_speculative() fails, you mustn't use that pointer *whether* 
it has changed or not. So there's no point in even testing, and the code 
obviously doesn't.

Either the value can change, or it can not. It's that simple.
If it cannot change, then we can load it just once, or we can load it 
multiple times, and it won't matter. Barriers won't do anything but screw 
up the code.
If it can change from under us, you need to use rcu_dereference(), or 
open-code it with an ACCESS_ONCE() or put in barriers. But your placement 
of a barrier was NONSENSICAL. Your barrier didn't protect anything else - 
like the test for the RADIX_TREE_INDIRECT_PTR bit.
And that was the fundamental problem.
And once you fix that fundamental problem, your barrier no longer makes 
any sense, because the barrier HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER 
page_cache_get_speculative() fails or not!
