But byte-for-byte identity isn't (necessarily) possible when actually
unifying. If the same function exists in different forms on 32- and
64-bit, then unifying requires I pick one of them (or perhaps a new
superset) to use in the unified form. That function may generate
different code compared to the one that it replaced...
But you're right, I can do the patches in a more piecemeal form. I'll
see if I can rework them.
