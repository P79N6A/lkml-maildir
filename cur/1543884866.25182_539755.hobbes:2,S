There are existing programs which parse /proc/meminfo.  If we're going to
do any of this then it would need to be via new fields.
I don't think we should be altering the meaning of the HugePages fields
like this.  One can imagine scenarios in which such a change would cause
existing userspace scripts to fail.  Plus it's Just Weird to use
/proc/meminfo in this manner.

If it's per-cpuset information then shouldn't it be presented in
/dev/cpuset/something?
