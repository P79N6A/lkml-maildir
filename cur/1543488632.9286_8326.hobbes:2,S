Subject: Strange memory preference?

After playing around with heavy memory consuming progs
like using xv in directories with +5-8000 files =>
100-200M-Swap full in use, i have the impression that after
terminating the progs, there is only swap-mem available
instead of RAM. The progs don`t have mem-leaks and it seems
that kernel preferes to use swap-mem. 
As result after 10-14 days uptime, machine get's so slow 
(everytime hdd-swapping for whatever command ) while nothing
else except std-daemons up and swap-mem +-zero,
It looks like shared/buffers/cached-mem is blocked.
so that only a reboot helps...
Machine has 2.2.1/K6-366/32M/libc5
later
