Well ... I don't have one either.  However, Grant Grundler did a
presentation to OLS about relaxed ordering, and I went over it pretty
thoroughly with him a while ago.  The bottom line is that the default is
always strict unless both the bridge and the device agree otherwise.

OK ... I think this is definitely a PCI specific API ... and probably a
generic one for requesting order flushes in devices that have negotiated
relaxed ordering.  Do you want to start a new thread on linux-pci and cc
me?
