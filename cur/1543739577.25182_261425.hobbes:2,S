Actually, now there is. Starting with 2.6.9 it is possible to force
either rescan or reconnect for devices connected to serio ports:
	echo -n "reconnect"  > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serio1/driver
should cause re-probe. Just FYI. As Greg said the USB handoff patch
is in -mm three and should take care of most of the issues.
BTW, I think that handoff should be activated by default. I am lurking
in Gentoo forums and there are coultless people having problems with
their mice/touchpads detected properly unless they load their USB drivers
first.
