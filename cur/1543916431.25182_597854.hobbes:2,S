  Found it!
  The problem was "Framebuffer Console support". It was enabled by default in older
  configs (like 2.6.22.7) but I think someone noticed this was bad and put it to
  default N in newer (2.6.23-rc7); and since I reused the .config from 2.6.21.3 ...
  So there, if one wants "ATI Radeon display support" on Radeon XPRESS 200M with
  X using radeon_drv.so, *should* put "Framebuffer Console support" to N (if it's
  not already).
  Now all I have to do is figure out what's the equivalent of "vga=791" on the new
  kernel (default text console looks really bad on my laptop).
  Sorry for all the noise (and spam),
