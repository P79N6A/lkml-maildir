Thank you.

I thought about it and thought it was over optimizing (US spelling).
But I could be wrong.

I thought about it too, but I wanted to avoid the coping of the data 
fields. Currently the callee does:
                   data = list_entry(list.next, struct call_single_data,
                                           list);
                   list_del(&data->list);
                   /*
                    * 'data' can be invalid after this call if
                    * flags == 0 (when called through
                    * generic_exec_single(), so save them away before
                    * making the call.
                    */
                    data_flags = data->flags;
                    data->func(data->info);
I would need to have a stack item like I did in my first release, and copy 
it.
	d = *data;
	smp_wmb();
	data->flags &= ~CDS_FLAG_LOCK;
	d->func(d->info).
I figured that the contention would only happen with a second caller. The
first caller does not have to wait. And I doubt that there would be many
instances of two callers contending. Matters how often smp_call_function 
is called.
Probably not enough contention to worry about.

Probably not, but I kept it just in case. I see there's a way a caller
can pass in their own data through
       generic_exec_single()
A user could potentially set the ALLOC flag. But since the enum is defined 
in this file, I find that highly unlikely. But looking at some of the code 
in the kernel, I would not be surprised if it is.

I guess someone should flag the arch list.
