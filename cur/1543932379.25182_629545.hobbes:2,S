Do I understand correctly?:  A device and the CPUs communicate via two
separate memory areas:  A data buffer and a status FIFO.  The NUMA
interconnect may reorder accesses of the device to the areas.  (Write
accesses?  Read accesses?  Both?)
To ensure synchronization between device and CPUs, you want to mark a
memory area which is to be dma-mapped with a flag which says:  "Writes
to the memory region will cause in-flight DMA to be flushed".  Whose
writes?  A write access from the device or a write access from a CPU?
