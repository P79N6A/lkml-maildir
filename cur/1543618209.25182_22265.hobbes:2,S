Is this not the effect of stopping the actual IO?
Then you have to issue another ACB to restart the IO for the next segment?
The device has to know when to stop sending.
ERM, the pain is sinking in .....
It may be possible to do this is paging requirement if on a READ(any pio),
reset or update the rq->buffer prior to reading from the data register.
Now what guarentee will the driver have if a the buffer being a full 8
sectors before the first read, and if that is not enough for the complete
segment transaction, then if we reduce the expected transfers size between
interrupts, it will allow for larger values to be put into the
sector_count register.  This reduction must correspond to the expected and
required 4k page.
This I can do, and we can move forward.
If the update of the rq->buffer occurrs afterwards, we may face a
driver--device race w/ an early and missied interrupt asserted.
This sounds like what "Davide Libenzi" is reporting.
Not really a losted, but arrived while the rq->buffer is being updated.
Thus ordering of events are wrong.
forced to set max_multi_sector to page size.
cmd->(buffer must be attached)->isr(statDRQ|BSY,read2buffer)->reload_isr()
	isr_n(get_new_buffer,statDRQ|BSY,read2buffer)->reload_isr()
if we relaunch because of statDRQ|BSY is not correct, we need to know the
new buffer is loaded.
writing becomes more interesting.
I have to overlay lay Linux on to the state diagrams and then redraft.
