A competing OS vendor is claiming that the Linux kernel has no way to 
measure the following:
a. Time spent waiting for page faults in percent
b. Total transfer time for each auxiliary memory in percent
c. Time in percent when one or more tasks were blocked waiting for 
memory resources
d. Time spent waiting for page faults in percent
I was wondering if the claims were pure FUD or are measurements 
possible -- whether they are actually implemented or not is not 
important (at least at this stage).  Apologies if the descriptions 
aren't very precise; OTOH that leaves us room to interpret the claims 
in a favourable (to us) manner :)
TIA and regards,
