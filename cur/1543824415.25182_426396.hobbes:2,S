Thanks.

Yes, I have another large pile of fixes to sort out.  Unfortunately, all
of them depend on some "code motion" driver changes that, in an ideal
world, should be deferred until 2.6.18.  Regenerating and testing them
against 2.6.17, without the code motion, is a big pain in the big
painful body region.
How do you feel about taking one code motion patch for 2.6.17?  :-)
