  You should be able to use mii-tool, or ethtool (one or both should 
work) to check the state your ethernet controller thinks it is set to, 
and change the settings.
[root@sflory cujo]# mii-tool -v eth0
eth0: negotiated 100baseTx-FD, link ok
  product info: vendor 00:aa:00, model 51 rev 0
  basic mode:   autonegotiation enabled
  basic status: autonegotiation complete, link ok

  link partner: 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD
[root@sflory cujo]# ethtool eth0
