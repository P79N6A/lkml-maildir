OK, great, this is the biggest remaing issue with -I4, because jackd
does that a lot.

2 and 1.  Now that I think about it, this could have happened during
bootup, before my rc.local set these.  I will try passing them on the
kernel command line. 
Not sure I understand the difference between 2:1 and 2:0.   Would the
latter make the kernel only preemptible at the voluntary preemption
points?

It think this one was caused by switching virtual consoles.  At one
point Andrew Morton suggested I remove the (un)lock_kernel calls from
do_tty_write.  This fixed the problem, with no detectable side effects. 
Maybe this could be incorporated into voluntary-preempt, it would be
useful to have more than one person to test it.
