Repeatedly extracting tars while compiling kernels.
Andrea, I think you mixed up what the descriptions go to. They come *under*
the numbers, not above, commenting on only the test directly above them.
(eg, "First noticeable difference" is about "xtar_load")
Yes, these are kind of meaningless without descriptions. You can find those
at the webpage, 
http://contest.kolivas.net/
 ... This will make more sense with
that, of course how meaningful it is is always up to debate :)
All of these benchmark the kernel compile while doing something else in the
background.

That's practically one of the loads, actually.
"IO Load - copies /dev/zero continually to a file the size of
	the physical memory."
Which dds blocks the size of MemTotal in /proc/meminfo to a file
in /tmp in a shell script as long as the kernel compile is running.

elevator.c is untouched, ll_rw_blk.c follows. The full patch is here:

It's called "contest" because it's a reasonably arbitrary test of what
the kernel does under some circumstances that's put out by Con Kolivas.
Con's test. Contest. It's not supposed to actually mean anything.
