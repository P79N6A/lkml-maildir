Hm, I started to wonder if this is not somewhat related to a recent
report I got.  "The victim" was running 2.2.19 (basically) on an SMP
Alpha UP2000+ with two 800 MHz processors.  He managed to reduce the
problem to a rather small test case and I attach sources,  Makefile and
a "loop.sh" driver as a shar archive if you want to have a closer look.
This "loop.sh" simply fires triplets of "harry" process in a loop.
The guy hit by this gets apparently random floating point exceptions
starting with roughly sixth process and later intervals between bombs
will vary.  I have also 'strace' outputs from failing processes but
they are not telling very much.  'gdb' is also not very illuminating:
Program received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.

He tells me that he is getting that on two different machines he has
around.
The trouble is that I tried to repeat that with different hardware,
kernels, compilers and libraries and I failed even on SMP; but I got an
access to a box with only 667 MHz processors.  OTOH he is running
right now 2.4.3-ac9 plus Andrea Arcangeli patches for rw semaphores
on Alpha and he reports that the problem went away (and, hopefuly,
nothing else will crop out :-).
Anybody can offer an insight what that may really be?  It may be,
of course, totally unrelated to this report from Victor Zandy.
