Hi Marcelo,
we missed this patch sent by Kirill Korotaev on LKML. Fortunately, Roberto
noticed it and forwarded it to me.
Since it's been there for a very long time, there's no emergency, but the
problem looks real and the fix seems to be confirmed, so if you have not
closed 2.4.33 yet, it might be worth merging it too.
Here it is as a git patch, but I've queued it in -upstream if you prefer.
Cheers,
Willy
