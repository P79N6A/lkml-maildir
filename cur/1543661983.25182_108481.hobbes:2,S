Andrew, don't you think you should write a linux manpage and/or other 
documentation when you add system calls like fadvise to linux?  Also, 
Andrew, your measurements would be a lot more understandable if you did 
not use programs written by you and not present in any linux distro (do 
I understand that correctly?) without defining what they do.  Yes? ;-)
