Subject: [PATCH 2.4] list_entry -> container_of like in 2.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/11/11/217

It was pointed out to me (thanks cdub!) that list_entry is equivalent
to container_of. However, in 2.5 list_entry simply calls container_of
as it is a more descriptive name. So here is a patch to both add
container_of and make list_entry a wrapper around it.
Thanks.
Hanna
