Yes. The problem being: how to deal with DOS-style names (no extended
records). I suspect that everybody else use them when they want uppercase.
We can do the same (show those beasts in uppercase), but it will mean
utter ugliness for FAT mounted as VFAT.
OK, just for sanity check - could you do that on a diskette and drop the
(gzipped) image on FTP somewhere? Or just email it to me if it will be
small (it will, if you will start from dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/fd0;
mformat a:).
