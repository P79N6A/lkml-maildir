The task name is not a reliable indicator of true name and truncated so
is useless. You only nominate one task, you don't integrate with the
existing interface.
What you actually need is notifiers to work on /proc (exactly the same as
we need to avoid the bogus waitfd crap). At that point you can implement
arbitary policy by using dnotify/inotify/etc on /proc.
