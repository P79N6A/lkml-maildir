Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the original AHCI enclosure patch
expose activity LEDs via sysfs?
I'm not saying there aren't a lot of non standard pieces that need to be
activated by direct commands or other user activated protocol.  I am
saying there are a lot of standard pieces that we could do with showing
in a uniform manner.
The pieces I think are absolutely standard are
1. Actual enclosure presence (is this device in an enclosure)
2. Activity LED, this seems to be a feature of every enclosure.
I also think the following are reasonably standard (based on the fact
that most enclosure standards recommend but don't require this):
3. Locate LED (for locating the device).  Even if you only have an
activity LED, this is usually done by flashing the activity LED in a
well defined pattern.
4. Fault.  this is the least standardised of the lot, but does seem to
be present in about every enclosure implementation.
All I've done is standardise these four pieces ... the services actually
take into account that it might not be possible to do certain of these
(like fault).
