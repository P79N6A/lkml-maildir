Hi,
I didn't find out whom to report this bug to and thus report to
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org as described in
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/lkml/reporting-bugs.html.
I'm posting from outside, so please CC me.
[1] The description about seccomp is outdated in some arch/*/Kconfig
    files.
[2] According to the source (2.6.23.14) seccomp is to be activated using
    pcrtl. It was previously activated using a file /proc/<pid>/seccomp.
    The Kconfig documentation (also displayed in menuconfig) does not
    reflect this change and is thus wrong.
[3] seccomp documentation Kconfig
[4] 2.6.23.14, seems to also apply to git head:
    
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=arch/x86/Kconfig;h=80b7ba4056dbbb566841c1e1cbef9475730fe199;hb=HEAD
[5] no oops
[6] less arch/x86_64/Kconfig
    /SECCOMP
[7] Ask me again if you really think you need information about the
    environment for a documentation bug.
