Alan, I think we've located the bug that made 2.2 kernels
run completely out of memory :)
Andrea, the last few pages are meant for ATOMIC and
PF_MEMALLOC allocations only, otherwise you'll get
deadlock situations.
And don't point me at buggy code that crashes if its
GFP_KERNEL allocation fails. That same code would
also crash if it were allowed to fill up freepages.min
and then run really out of memory...

Rik
