Don't worry.
Basically, merging is my job, and I happily do it. If I hit something that 
makes me nervous enough, I'll just push back and say "please merge this 
for me", but if I merge up conflicts on my own, I generally just let 
people know that I did it - not because it's a *problem*, but as a 
heads-up to let people know that they should double-check the end result.
Quite frankly, real merge conflicts happen rarely enough that it really 
isn't a problem. And 99% of the time, the conflicts are really pretty damn 
obvious, and doing them isn't a problem at all. So even when I ask people 
to "please check", most of the time I expect that the end result is fine.
So my "please double-check" was in no way meant to be a criticism or a 
"please do this better next time". It was _literally_ just meant to be 
just that and nothing more: a "please double-check", especially since for 
something like XFS, I'm not actually doing any testing personally.
So no worries.
