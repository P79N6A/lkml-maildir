Go back to the original _reason_ for this whole discussion. 
It's not really a "resume" event, it's a "populate caches really
efficiently at boot" event. But the two are basically the same problem,
it's only a matter of how much you populate (do you populate _everything_
or do you populate just disk caches. Populating just the caches is the
smaller and simpler problem, that only solves the "fast boot" issue).
