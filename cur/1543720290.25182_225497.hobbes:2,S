It does that  for the unique  filenames and id stamps (maildir format and
message ids). But it should be easy to replace this with a cached getpid
result, if this is realy a performance problem. On a traditional unix system
pid and timestamp should be locally unique for non threaded applications.

I wonder if it easyly would be possible to cache the getpid() result in some
thread local segment. Is there any, which is present for all clone flags?
Not tha I care much about this unneeded glibc optimizsation, but more out of
curiousity about the new threadind functionality.
