I just tried it... copying the exact same files across from the exact
same hdd etc. It didn't crash my system this time, and the files seem
okay. However - there were long pauses where CPU load was so high that X
wouldn't update the screen for about 10 seconds at a time, and things
were acting slightly weird for a few seconds after i got back my prompt.
And now the HDD light is on permanently whether i have disk access or
not. Hmm.
Though this *could* be a coincidence.
