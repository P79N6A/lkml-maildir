I don't think anyone has suggested that bug fixes shouldn't make it into
the stable kernels. Even if userland tools need to be updated, bugs should
generally be fixed, though I can imagine rare cases where a workaround
would be better than a fix.
On the other hand, I don't want to see new features added to a "stable"
kernel series whether they require updated userland tools or not. Nor do I
want to see performance enhancements or code clean-ups. Stability is more
important to me.
