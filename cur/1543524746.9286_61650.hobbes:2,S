Hi,
I've just read the pressrelease about MontaVista "HardHat", about enhancing the
realtime performance of linux
http://linuxpr.com/releases/1180.html
here the relevant snippet:
--
Building upon a "one hundred percent pure Linux" base, MontaVista is
   characterizing driver-level and user process response characteristics in the
   Linux kernel and engineering a range of improvements to enable guaranteed
   single-millisecond response times. All such enhancements will be released back
   to the open source community under the Gnu Public License.
....
Technical Details MontaVista improvements in Linux soft real-time
   performance include reduction in worst-case interrupt blocking times,
   development of a fixed-priority real-time scheduler with constant dispatch
   overhead, and methods for dramatically improving process-level response
   timings. 
....
Single millisecond precision is already possible with Ingo's low-latency
patches, 
I was wondering if Montavista will cooperate with Ingo's low-latency work,
or if they are doing their own low-latency implementation ?
(It would be preferable cooperating with the kernel developers,
in order to avoid duplication and/or incopatible overlaps).
Any thoughts ?
Benno.
