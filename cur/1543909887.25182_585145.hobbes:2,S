Subject: Regression in 'tty layer struct pid conversions' (2.6.21)?

Hello Eric,
Since 2.6.21, the KDE 'fish' protocol (basically remote file system access 
using ssh) has started showing problems, mostly on systems running x86_64 
kernels. The process crashes with a signal 29.
The bug log indicated a relation with the kernel. A git-bisect has shown the 
cause to be the activation patch in the 'tty layer struct pid conversions' 
patch set:
commit ab521dc0f8e117fd808d3e425216864d60390500 
Author: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com> 
Date:   Mon Feb 12 00:53:00 2007 -0800 
     [PATCH] tty: update the tty layer to work with struct pid 
 
It looks from the description of the patch set that it should cause no 
changes in behavior. It may of course be that the change in the kernel has 
exposed a latent issue in the KDE code.
Details about the issue are available in the KDE BTS:
http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145123
The comments in that report indicate that the issue is almost certainly
more related to the (relative?) speed of systems than to x86_64 as an 
architecture.
Cheers,
Frans Pop
