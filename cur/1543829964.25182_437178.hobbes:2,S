Andrey,
I began to play with your patchset. I am able to connect to 127.0.0.1 
from different namespaces. Is it the expected behavior ?
Furthermore, I am not able to have several programs, running in 
different namespaces, to bind to the same INADDR_ANY:port.
Will these features be included in the second patchset ?
