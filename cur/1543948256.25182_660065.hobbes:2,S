Thanks for the log, it helped out a lot.  I'm thinking that you have
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED set to Y, right?  If so, can you set it to N
(hopefully you have a new userspace to handle that)?
I think we're trying to add a file with the same name as the device
object for the pci bus, which is wierd, because the namespace issues
should keep this from happening.
That being said, this warning really scares me:
kobject (c7c35900): tried to init an initialized object, something is seriously wrong.

 =======================
We did just find a problem in the kobject core that might be causing
this to happen, can you try the patch below to see if this causes it to
go away as well?
thanks,

Subject: kobject: properly initialize ksets
kset_initialize was calling kobject_init_internal() which didn't
initialize the kobject as well as kobject_init() was.  So have
kobject_init() call kobject_init_internal() and move the logic to
initalize the kobject there.
