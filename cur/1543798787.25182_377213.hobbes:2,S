Yeah, I was only referring to that particular case (the ia64 code does 
test then CAS, so removing the write bias on the load avoided a lot of 
thrashing for locks under contention).

Right, in that case, biasing for read might make sense, as long as some 
other CPU doesn't cause the line to go back to shared before you 
actually get to the CAS.
