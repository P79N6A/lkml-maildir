You can have control over it, which I think the whole point of this
discussion ..

In the case of lockstat you have two cases fast and functional, and
non-functional .. Right now your patch has no slow and functional state.
The non-functional state is even the majority from my perspective.

As I said before there is no reason why and architectures should be
forced to implement sched_clock() .. Is there some specific reason why
you think it should be mandatory?
