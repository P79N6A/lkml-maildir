Remember? This is not humanity. We're a community made of one Great
Penguin (you guess who), few smaller penguins (kernel developers),
and many many little rabbits (tring to learn something, with or without
a debugger)...  what has Mankind to do with us?  B-) B-) B-)
Anyway, you mean that one could:
1) read l-k,
2) choose an item from some TODO list,
3) download the kernel tarball and correctly untar it,
4) fire the editor of choice,
5) read the Source,
6) understand the Source,
7) contemplate It,
8) even dare to modify It,
9) produce a patch file with correct diff options,
10) find out the correct address to send the patch to,
11) launch the browser, and successfully open the form page,
and after that stop for not being able to fill the template? You *really*
believe this is a likely scenario?
