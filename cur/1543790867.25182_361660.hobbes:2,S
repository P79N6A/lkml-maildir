Not generally, no. And definitely not easily.

I have to say that the bk->cvs gateway is actually a very impressive 
linearization, and I don't even know how it did it. But even that one 
wasn't perfect - occasionally it ended up with big patches for merges.
Using "git bisect" to generate successive bisections (and then building up 
a linearization patch from that) would work, but it would result in some 
_really_ strange things: it would basically have one patch do one thing, 
then the next patch might _undo_ that, and do another, and then the third 
patch would re-do it and do them both together.
And that's really sometimes the best linearization you can do. But that's 
just too strange and confusing, I think. And the patches would be horribly 
inefficient.
At that point I'd rather teach people to use "git bisect" natively. It 
wouldn't be any less confusing than the patches ;)
