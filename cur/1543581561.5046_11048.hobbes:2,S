I've just checked: "Sending a multicast list set command" is printed only on
high debug levels, so Augustin might not see them.
If "Receiver lock-up workaround activated" message is printed, then the
workaround is really activated.
I doubt that the real reason is that RX bug, but periodic multicast list set
commands may certainly affect the behavior.
Augustin, could you send the output of `lspci' and `eepro100-diag -ee', please?
(The latter may be taken from 
ftp://scyld.com/pub/diag/
)
Best regards
