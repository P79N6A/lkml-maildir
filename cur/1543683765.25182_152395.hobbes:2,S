O10 feels great here; behaviour under heavy load (make -jbignumber) is great;
gcc doesn't starves the rest of the processes; it still allows X/xchat/xmms/etc
do some work and the system remains usable; mp3 doesn't skip too much (only
when it tries to swapin some big process like galeon but i find that normal; before
this the same load in the past starved anything not classified as "compiler").
