	I have a Creative Labs Graphics Blaster TNT PCI card (using
the nVidia Riva TNT chipset).
	If I enable the VESA framebuffer support in the 2.2.0 kernel,
as soon as LILO boots the kernel, nothing else is outputted to my
monitor, even though I can hear the system load...
	The system is a Cyrix 6x86/200, and I have the newest firmware
loaded on the TNT card.
	I'm wondering if anybody else has been able to get the VESA fb
support working with a TNT card...
					Thanks,
