that's probably true, but I think it would be nice to be able to
assume that if longptr points to a location containing 1L, then
* (short int *) longptr == 1.
This doesnt work on sparc etc. Again mostly binary compatibility issues are
there between programs which took pointers to fields which later got extended.
All of them _have_ to be recompiled. On little endian, you can get away with
not doing so.
