No, there's another difference: pre3 will loop forever, even if there is
nothing to do - until something comes up that needs scheduling. Basically,
the pre3 loop boils down to
	do {
		/* not interesting */
	} while (!tsk->need_resched);
when there is enough memory.
Which obviously causes excessive CPU to be wasted.
NOTE! The "obviously" is a bit strong. What happens is that kswapd is only
woken up when needed, so most of the time it is sleeping. It's only when
it is woken up and when it has done its work when the loop turns into a
CPU-burner, but it can easily mean that kswapd will just spend CPU time
for no good reason until its time-slice is exhausted.
So think of the bug as "kswapd will waste the final part of its timeslice
doing nothing useful".
