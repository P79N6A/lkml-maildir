one problem was that the WORK_MASK definitions in thread_info.h were not 
updated - neither the word-sized tests in entry.S. This meant we missed 
delayed-preemption on return-from-kernel. But we've got one free bit in 
the first by - bit 6, so i moved the DELAYED bit there. Another bug was 
that the idle thread did not check for delayed preemption. I fixed these 
in the -48-07 patch.
