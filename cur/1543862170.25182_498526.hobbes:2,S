Subject: What's in git.git and announcing GIT v1.5.0-rc1

The tip of 'master' branch is tagged as v1.5.0-rc1; this means a
few things:
 - The focus is shifted to stabilize 'master'.  Fixes to what
   are already there are very much appreciated.
 - I'll change my $PATH to use the 'master' version, not 'next',
   for my own use until v1.5.0 final.  I ask people who usually
   follow 'next' to do the same so that we can catch breakages
   on 'master'.
 - No new features nor major changes, whether they have been
   cooking in 'next' or not, will be merged to 'master' until
   v1.5.0 final.  I might drop patches on the floor that are not
   meant for 'master', although I intend to try hard to keep up
   with whatever the list comes up with.
Tonight's update merges a handful remaining topics from 'next',
along with fixes and updates directly applied to 'master'.
