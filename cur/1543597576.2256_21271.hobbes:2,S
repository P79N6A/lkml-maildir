Unfortunately to comply with NFSv2, the cookie cannot be larger than
32-bits.  I believe this oversight has been correct in later NFS versions.
I do agree that forcing the underlying fs to "fix" itself for NFS is the
wrong solution. I can understand their desire to follow unix semantics
(although I don't entirely agree with them), so until I think up a more
palatable solution for the linux community, I will just keep my patches to
myself :)
