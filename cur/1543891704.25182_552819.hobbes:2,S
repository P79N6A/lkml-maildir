His secondary MX server:
   220 mailrelay1.lrz-muenchen.de (IntraStore TurboSendmail) ESMTP Service ready
yields at times "451-responses".  (It suffers from occasional resource starvations
and only way to get out of it is to temporarily give those replies.)
Indeed there was queue timer bug at VGER in case remote replied with
TEMPFAILs sufficiently many times, the whole destination queue to it
got kicked back way too much.
