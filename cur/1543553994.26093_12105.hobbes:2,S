I am going thru the steps atm.  The JE driver also hangs.
More information.  I have an external USB 4 port hub, in which I have one
logitech mouse at the moment.  I can cold boot and reboot to my heart's
delight fine.  But if I unplug/plug in the mouse and reboot, it will hang.
Note, I have to unplug and plug back in the mouse to get it recognized by
the system before I can use it.
So we're probably looking at something other than the uhci/je driver.
