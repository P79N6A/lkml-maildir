My secret-undocumented protocol for handling a patch which I think is
needed in 2.6.current and which is handled via a subsystem tree is:
- queue it up behind all the subsystem trees in -mm's "2.6.25:" section
  - actually it's now "2.6.25"'s "others:" section.  I've split the
    "2.6.25:" section into two parts: "me:" and "others:".
- drop it if it turns up in a subsystem tree
  - and hope like hell that whoever merged it has considered whether
    it's needed in the current kernel cycle, because I just lost track of
    it.
- let it cook for a few days or more, to give time for people to comment,
  and perhaps to get it into a -mm release
- send it out to the subsystem maintainer tagged as "[patch (for 2.6.25?)]"
- repeat.

the way to stop me from continuing to loop is to send me an "acked-by,
please send to Linus for 2.6.25".
I'll then move the patch into -mm's "me:" section (or even right up next to
origin.patch if it's simple-and-obvious) for sending to LT.
