This would be a nice thing to keep track of.
Isn't it the case that reclaimable slab pages (dentry, inode, mbcache,
dquot) should not be accounted as wired memory?  Could perhaps use
SLAB_RECLAIM_ACCOUNT for that.
It would need to be overridden for, say, sysfs inodes and dentries, but
they're about to become reclaimable anyway so no prob.
It would need to be overridden for, say, ramfs dentries and inodes though.
rd.c's blockdev pagecache pages are wired.
