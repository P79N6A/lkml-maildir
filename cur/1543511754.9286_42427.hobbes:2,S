I think we're missing something here.. I do run devfs, and I do not run a
daemon.. Things get created Just Fine.  The user-space daemon is
_optional_, not required.  devfs _does_ create and delete the nodes
itself, but if you want anything fancy, you need to tell it what to do
(thus the user-space daemon).

No, it is not.. You can unmount devfs, and it will be restored, however.
