I agree, and we probably could do so with some sparse extension (just make 
the rule be that in order to make a __user pointer, the base type needs to 
have been tagged with __user_visible). So we _could_ do something like 
that, and have a sane checking model where sparse would warn if it sees a 
user pointer of something that wasn't marked as being a user-visible type.
But I doubt it's really worth it. A lot of the usage cases for users end 
up being about constants etc that we really can't check sanely and 
automatically. And some historical user-space usage is literally just 
about user space finding the kernel headers really helpful (ie using the 
list.h headers for user-space lists, or the inline asms for atomic stuff 
for threaded apps that don't rely on ptrace locking).
