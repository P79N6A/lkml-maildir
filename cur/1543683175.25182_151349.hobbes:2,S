I was working  on a project during  my free time using BK,  and then I
get employed  by a company  contributing to Subversion. My  license is
then void, but I want to be  able to still use the files and servers I
used before. Reverse is allowed, and moral, in this case.

Without any lose of data and meta-data ?
And still, my license being void, how could I do that ?
(of course, I am not in this  case - I'll never be crazy enough to use
a non-free software to store my data).
