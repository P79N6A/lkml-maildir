Hi William,

Hmm, but you know, that users of get_user_pages() play games with
pages? They need to lock them into memory, mark them eventually
dirty, map them to a struct scatterlist and much more.
I worked on an API (I called it the page-walk-api), to make this
more and more transparent. 
So if this work will go into 2.6.x, then the page-walk-API will
be needed, or else the driver writers playing tricks with
virtual<->physical<->bus address conversions will go nuts.
So which kernel is the target of this development?
