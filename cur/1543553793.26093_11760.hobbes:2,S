Hmm. One of these weird bandwidth limiters again?

2.2 does not save RTTs between connections. The RTT is lower than 2.2's
initial 3s RTT, so 2.2 would never see it. One useful experiment would 
be to flush the routing cache between attempts or turn off the tcp metrics 
saving (why don't we have a sysctl for that btw?)
