Says you, and a number of other people around here.
App developers seem to feel differently. Accept reality.

It's fixable via #ifdef __KERNEL__ of course.

Well, ideally it'd be LGPL, but yes.

Perhaps. This is duplication of effort though.
You're the person trying to change the app developers.
If you want to change them, provide an alternative that
doesn't totally suck ass.

Most clients won't allow adding such headers manually.
I don't actually subscribe to the list. Most clients won't
expire old list traffic, and I certainly can't have lkml pour
unhindered into my inbox. It really doesn't work for me,
so I cut and paste from a list archive. Sorry. Ideas are
welcome of course, but I'm not expecting any reasonable
solution to exist.
