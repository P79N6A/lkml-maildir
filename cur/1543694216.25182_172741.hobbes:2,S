Well, unless it's an interrupts-safe critical section that's hurting,
you could take profiles, provided you have enough RAM for the profile
buffer (which appears to be large). You could easily do a quick hack
to steal the profile buffer from e820 regions not otherwise used for
RAM (i.e. unused because you did mem=) to handle that for a slow cpu
with more RAM than 8MB.
