So taking open software and closed hardware and combining it into 
something that I cannot modify is ok by you? But since you support GPLv2 
I take it you do not find it ok to take open software and closed 
software and combine that into something that I cannot modify. 
Personally, I consider both equal violations of the rights I seek to 
protect when I license my code under the GPL.

Just to make things clear, are you only having problems with the risk of 
forcing everyone to hand out their signing keys, or are you also opposed 
to preventing the hardware scenario above (provided it could be done 
without side-effects)?
