Sorry, s/file descriptor/file-or-socket-or-whatever.
Actually trying to read from this descriptor is of course a Bad Thing, but
that just means that the programmer forgot to record the file closing in
the program's global state.

Well, if it triggers a return from select(), which it currently doesn't
do under Linux, then it should also trigger a return from read() (with
either zero or -EBADF).
I wonder whether any other Unixes do that..?

Right -- I sort-of implied that. My fault.
