Have you considered publishing -mm using git?
I guess your workflow prevents you from really using git,
but even just publishing releases using git would be great.
(Just now I'm tracking Linus with my tree.  git makes that quite easy.
Tracking -mm is ugly manual work with diff, patch and ketchup...)
