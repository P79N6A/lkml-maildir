It might not be :), but surely once people see what the actual
administration challenges turn out to be, they/we can write the tools to
satisfy those needs?  I don't believe they will be insurmountable.
You had in the past played with caps quite a bit, do you already have a
sense of what kinds of admin problems people will have?

Ok, here's a patch on top of 2.6.22-rc4-mm2 to do so,
