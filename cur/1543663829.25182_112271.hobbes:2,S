First of all, let me say that you're doing wonders with this driver.
But this particular patch I don't like. It improves stuff that should
be removed. More specifically:
1. Does anything prevent you from using the medium detection
hooks the network layer provides?
2. What need is there to export manufacturer id and mac address
again?
3. Doesn't the rest belong into sysfs rather than procfs?
