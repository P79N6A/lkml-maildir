(rofl, look at that mess: it was utterly impractical, unrealistic and
stupid for gcc to go and UTFify the compiler output.  Sigh.  LANG=C, guys).

umm, the code *already* produces a warning.  So if you later add a
real used-uninitialised bug, you won't know about it, because everyone
was trained to ignore the warning anyway.
Best would be to find some way to restructure the code to make the warning
go away.
Meanwhile I'd say switch this to uninitialized_var() if it's that much of a
worry.
