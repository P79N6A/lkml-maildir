That's intresting.  I had no problem at all.
hda and hdc are using udma33 here.  hdb contains the swap, and
gets this error on boot:
hdb: Conner Peripherals 340MB - CP30344, ATA DISK drive
hdb: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady
SeekComplete Error }
hdb: set_drive_speed_status: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
ide0: Drive 1 didn't accept speed setting. Oh, well.
[...]
[same error message]
