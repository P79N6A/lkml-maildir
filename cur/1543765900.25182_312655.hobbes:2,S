Well, that would kinda be the intent behind the permissions file  --
it can specify what restricted set of images/devices/whatever the user
can mount, I suppose the sensible thing would be to always enforce
nosuid and nsgid, but I'd rather keep these as the default version of
options (allowing admins to shoot themselves in the foot perhaps, but
in the single-user workstation case, is seems like there's less reason
to be so paranoid).
