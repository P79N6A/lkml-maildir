Thanks a lot for your help. It really worked with disk driud. It 
cleverly managed the name conflicts of lables i.e. for first 
installation the root is "/" and for the second installation the root 
lable is "/1". After editing the /etc/lilo.conf of first installation 
and updating the MBR with /sbin/lilo appropriately, I can boot both of them.
