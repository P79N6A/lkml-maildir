Well, if you drop that down to 280k, and you do not beat zlib 
compression by a "comfortable margin", it's just pointless code churn in 
addition to swapping out the faster algorithm for the slower algorithm.
If you drop that down to 280k with much better compression than zlib, 
that's fantastic and useful, and people won't mind the slower algorithm :)
The issue of memory usage at high compression rates was the main reason 
why I didn't push the patch upstream and pursue bzlib further.
