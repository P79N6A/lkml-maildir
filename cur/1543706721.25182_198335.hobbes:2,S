Try booting with kernel parameter pnpbios=off, it's a problem with the 
pnp implementation of the intel 8(6?/7)5 chipset. (a bios upgrade to P18 
didn't help for me, I don't know if recent changes in 2.6.3-... address 
this issue)
I may not be the best person to answer this, I just know this is the 
problem ;-)
