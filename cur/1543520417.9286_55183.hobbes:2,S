Hi,
  pthreads don't seem to work for me under 2.3.31 on an Alpha platform.
They all seem to hang in pthread_create as far as I can tell; the same
binaries run fine under 2.2.13.  I originally found this on one of the
Linux/DVD programs and have repeated it with Mozilla and now the example
programs in the linuxthreads package.
  My C library is the libc-2.1.2 build as supplied with RedHat 6.1/Alpha
which would appear to be the latest glibc around. (Although Doc.../Changes
seem to reference a different, numerically lower version ?)
(2.3.33 won't build on Alpha).
An strace reveals at the end:
pipe([1205180, 512])                    = 3
clone()                                 = 696
write(4, "\220\371\377\37\1\0\0\0\5\0\0\0\0\2\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\10"..., 168)
= 168
sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [])              = 0x80000000 (old mask [])
write(4, "\200(#\0\0\2\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0`\5\0 "..., 168)
= 168
