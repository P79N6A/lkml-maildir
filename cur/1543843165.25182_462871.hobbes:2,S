Well, I have reproduced it with gregkh-usb-usbcore-remove-usb_suspend_root_hub.patch
reverted too.
Attached is the output of dmesg from the failing case with USB_DEBUG set.
It covers two attempts to suspend to disk, the second one being unsuccessful,

other patch to prevent the second suspend from failing applied, but it doesn't
help.]
