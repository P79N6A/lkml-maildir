Can you also send the output from "cat /proc/interrupts".
It looks like you are not using IO-APIC, but instead using XT-PIC.
XT-PIC is a lot slower than IO-APIC.
Just turn on SMB support in the "make menuconf", and it should enable 
IO-APIC.
If you cannot boot using IO-APIC, you probably have one of the bad VIA 
motherboards. I have not determined if the IO-APIC issues with VIA 
VT8235 MBs is hardware or software related. All I know, is some VIA 
VT8235 MBs work, and some don't. I am still investigating why.
