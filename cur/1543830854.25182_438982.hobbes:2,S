IIRC some Altix boxes don't support 32 bit DMA for PCI-X devices.  Based 
on the initialization code I looked at (just a quick scan), it looks 
like the command packet initialization is done before the switch to a 64 
bit DMA mask, which might cause the failure you see here.  You can try 
this patch out (totally untested).  It's not fully correct, it should 
probably try 64 bit first then fall back to 32 bit if that fails then 
give up, and the other 64 bit DMA mask call should probably be removed.
Anyway, good luck.  If this one doesn't work you'll have to talk with one 
of the SGI guys and get some more debug info about the allocation 
failure for the command packets.
