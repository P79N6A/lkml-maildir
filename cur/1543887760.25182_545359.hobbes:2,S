This breaks the compilation of the oldest of our IDE disk drivers:
<--  snip  -->
...
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
drivers/built-in.o: In function `hd_init':
hd.c:(.init.text+0x44a7d): undefined reference to `drive_info'
hd.c:(.init.text+0x44a89): undefined reference to `drive_info'
hd.c:(.init.text+0x44a95): undefined reference to `drive_info'
hd.c:(.init.text+0x44aa1): undefined reference to `drive_info'
hd.c:(.init.text+0x44aad): undefined reference to `drive_info'
drivers/built-in.o:hd.c:(.init.text+0x44ab9): more undefined references to `drive_info' follow
make[1]: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
Considering the fact that we have two more recent drivers with the same 
functionality, it might be an option to simply remove this driver...
