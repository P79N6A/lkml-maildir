Linux will do this fine but it wears on the south bridge mainly and the
disk secondarily. Typically the disk is the sturdier of the two.
Assuming you unmounted it first, your may get anywhere from 20 to 300+
successful removals depending on the sb chip ie how much abuse it can
endure. Then you start getting disk errors that are initially recovered
but eventually hang your box. The south bridge ide channel and possibly
the disk too, will be hosed.
