I'm trying to install Red Hat 6.0 on a DS20.  I'm using the default images
from the distribution.  I have the ncr53c875 scsi controller on this
machine.  Every time I boot with the installation disk, the "ncr53c8xx"
driver is used.  However, this driver seems to timeout after resetting
the scsi bus.  I have this same card on my pc but I'm using the "sym53c8xx"
driver and I've had no problems.  
My question is: how do I get the installation setup to use the "sym53c8xx"
driver instead of the "ncr53c8xx" driver?
