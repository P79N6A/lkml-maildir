Yes, but the CPU has plenty of other work to do. The sound cards that
would be worst affected by this are the big RME cards (non-interleaved) and
multiple ice1712 cards (non-interleaved blocks of interleaved data),
which AFAIK are the only cards capable of handling serious professional audio.
This could represent 48 or more channels of 96kHz audio, which
doesn't leave a lot of spare CPU capacity for running X, for example.
