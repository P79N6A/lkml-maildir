I did quite a few times and it was successfully merged in 2.4. Now I'd
need to forward port to 2.6.
I recall I recommended Andrew to merge the lower_zone_reserve_ratio
at some point during 2.5 or early 2.6 but apparently he implemented this
other thing called sysctl_lower_zone_protection. Note that now that I
look more into it, it seems sysctl_lower_zone_protection and
lower_zone_reserve_ratio have very little in common, I'm glad
sysctl_lower_zone_protection is disabled.  sysctl_lower_zone_protection
is just an improvement to the algorithm I dropped from 2.4 when
lowmem_zone_reserve_ratio was merged.  So in short enabling
sysctl_lower_zone_protection won't help, sysctl_lower_zone_protection
should be dropped enterely and replaced with lower_zone_reserve_ratio.
