  Sharing irq between unrelated devices is probably evil in all cases,
but for identical devices like multiple NICs, the shared irq results in
*one* irq call, followed by polling the devices connected, which can be
lower overhead than servicing N interrupts on a multi-NIC system.
  Shared interrupts predate the PC by a decade (or more), so the comment
about the "PC design" is not relevant. In general polling multiple
devices is less CPU than servicing the same i/o by a larger number of
entries to the interrupt handler. The polling offers the possibility of
lower the number of context switches, far more expensive than checking a
device.
  In serial and network devices the poll is often unavoidable, unless
you use one irq for send and one for receive you will be doing a bit of
polling in any case.
