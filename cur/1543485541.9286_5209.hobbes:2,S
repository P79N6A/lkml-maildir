There _are_ changes due, if anyone can find out who the maintainer is. I had a
fix up for kerneld to make it work with 2.0.x kernels (useful if you dual-boot
2.0 / 2.2, and of course 2.2 doesn't use kerneld any more).
Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@cs.leidenuniv.nl> apparently has a vast superset
of my changes waiting to go in, I'm sure he'd like to know who the maintainer
is. Mind you, he might be busy right now -- didn't he just get made a big
cheese at Debian?
Cheers,
Steve
