  Not closely enough ... ;).  Yes - your removal of 'len' does
  indeed seem to have addressed Andrews key initial comment.

  The start, end, put, get names in that *.pdf might be a
  bit quicker to read.
  I suspect that more readers would come away with the right
  understanding, first time, if you struct was (taken roughly
  from the *.pdf, using an 'end' one bigger than *.pdf uses):
	/* kfifo is empty, not full, when head == tail */
	struct kfifo {
	    unsigned char *start;	/* [start, end) */
	    unsigned char *end;
	    unsigned char *head;	/* next input char goes in here */
	    unsigned char *tail;	/* next output char comes from here */
	    spinlock_t lock;
	};
  then your structure:
	struct kfifo {
	    unsigned int head;
	    unsigned int tail;
	    unsigned int size;
	    spinlock_t lock;
	    unsigned char *buffer;
	};
  Differences include names, all pointers, ordering of struct elements,
  and comments.  Perhaps some of these differences will look better to
  you than others.

  Quite possibly.
