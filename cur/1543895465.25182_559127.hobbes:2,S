It's broken with x86 too.  I looked into it for a bit and it appears 
that the Linux driver is using more LSI commands than it was before. 
The odd thing is that it's probing some space that is marked reserved in 
the LSI manual.  Unfortunately, I couldn't understand the SCSI system 
well enough to understand what changed in Linux.
