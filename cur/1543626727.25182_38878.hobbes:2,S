Really?  I didn't know that.  :-P
Seriously, only 2 of the disks need to be spun up to start the system, 
so I'd rather be able to login and have only processes which need to 
access the disks that aren't ready yet wait.  Hence the comment about 
spinning disks up on first access...
Also, the system has a ~1200W power supply, so I think it can spin more 
than 1 disk up at a time.  Again, defaulting to 1 is right and good, but 
making it tunable would be better.
