Hi Linus, Marcelo,
In each changelog entry, it would be really useful to include the
Message-ID of that email in a regex-parsable location. This way, if the
email was cced to lkml it would be possible for folks to track down the
actual patch.
I'm not familiar with your scripts, but I'd be surprised if this were very
difficult to implement. At the same time, there are many cases of changelog
entries that read only 'USB' or something equally unhelpful, where there is
little chance that anyone could track down the corresponding patch.  Having the
Message-ID in those cases would make all the difference in the world.
Be well,
Zack
