Dear David,
The program is an atmospheric chemistry-transport modeling code that computes 
the distributions of atmospheric species (e.g., ozone) as a function of 
latitude and altitude and how that changes with time.
Thanks for taking time to think about my problem. I greatly appreciate it.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Regards.
Sheo
