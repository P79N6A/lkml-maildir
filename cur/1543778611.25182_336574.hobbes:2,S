Hmm. The only thing I can think of is someone started adding calls
to device_suspend() before device_shutdown().  Not understanding
where it was a good idea I made certain the calls were in there
consistently.  
Andrew can you remove the call to device_suspend from kernel_restart
and see if this still happens?
I would suspect interrupts of being disabled but it looks like
kgdb is working and I think that requires an interrupt to notice
new characters.
