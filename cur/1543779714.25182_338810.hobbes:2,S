	This OOPS is caused by bad implementation of PCI2PCI data transfers
(hardware related). It is not related to V4L.
	In fact, bttv code uses also a blacklist from PCI code, activating
no_overlay option on bad chipsets:
void __devinit bttv_check_chipset(void)
{
        int pcipci_fail = 0;
        struct pci_dev *dev = NULL;
        if (pci_pci_problems & PCIPCI_FAIL)
                pcipci_fail = 1;
...
        if (pcipci_fail) {
                printk(KERN_WARNING "bttv: BT848 and your chipset may
not work together.\n");
                if (!no_overlay) {
                        printk(KERN_WARNING "bttv: going to disable
overlay.\n");
                        no_overlay = 1;
                }
        }
	I don't know for sure if these new chipsets are at PCI fail blacklist.
After Bodo and Andrew Burgess made these tests, we may submit some info
to PCI guys for them to add the chipsets to PCI blacklist, by setting
PCIPCI_FAIL flag at pcipci_fail global var.
Mauro.
