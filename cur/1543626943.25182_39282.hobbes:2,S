Hi!
  I have a script that is using the /cpu/procinfo file to determine the number of cpus present in the system. But I would like to implement it using a system call rather than use the environment variables?? I couldn't find a system call for linux that would give me the result. Could anyone please let me know if there is one for redhat linux??
Thanks for your time,
Priya
