Memory.  Could it be the good old MTRR problem?
Try "cat /proc/mtrr" and check that _all_ ordinary memory
is covered by a write-back mtrr.
Having most of the memory covered lacking a little at the top only
is not good enough - you'll see a major slowdown as linux tend to
use the topmost memory most and that will be very slow without
a MTRR.
If it indeed is a mtrr problem, confirm it by booting with mem=<low number>
and see that the machine is faster when not using the "slow" memory.
After that, get a bios upgrade or echo something useable
into /proc/mtrr
