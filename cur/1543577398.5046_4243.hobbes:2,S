But in this case, _any_ non-zero number of bytes copied is a success,
because it indicates that we have dirtied a portion of the page cache.

No, because then you'd be skipping the updatepage() call if we took a
fault mid-copy after copying some data.  That would imply you had
dirtied the page cache without an updatepage().
The current behaviour should just result in a short IO, which should
be fine.
