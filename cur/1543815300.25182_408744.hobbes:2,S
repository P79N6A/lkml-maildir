It is not; e.g. unpacking a tarball or running make(1) on even a
medium-sized tree is going to hurt that way.  Moreover, the same
goes for a lot of scripts, etc.
And that's aside of the question of CPU load you are inflicting -
it's not just 2000/sec, it's 2000/sec _and_ _nothing_ _else_ _gets_
_done_.
BTW, for real lookup speed, try find(1).  From hot cache.

So what happens upon rename()?
