I have configured "nuts" UPS software on a Fedora core 4 machine. I have 
configured it for USB port. I have also put in a rule in 
/etc/udev/rules.d/10-custom.rules as follows:
BUS="usb", KERNEL="hiddev0" MODE="667" OWNER="nut"
when I do #upsc smartups@localhost, the staus looks o.k.
I don't know why I am getting the following error message in my "messages" 
file:
***************************************************************************************************
Feb  8 11:26:42 peace kernel: drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: 
usb_submit_urb(ctrl) failed
Feb  8 11:26:42 peace kernel: drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: timeout 
initializing reports
*****************************************************************************************************
It is a APC Smart-UPS 1500.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.
