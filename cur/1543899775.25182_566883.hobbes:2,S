(Finally catching up on emails since Saturday!)
The freezer is also essential for doing a full image of memory - you have to 
be able to guarantee that some of the image won't change in order to be able 
to write it out before the atomic copy. Of course the freezer alone isn't 
enough, but it solves 95% of the issue.
