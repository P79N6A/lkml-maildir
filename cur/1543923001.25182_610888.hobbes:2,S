epoll documentation easily can. there is nothig keeping it from it. don't
make silly arguments like that.

You are again implying I lakc understanding. That is, however, not true.
I don't see the point in being insulted by you, so I won'T continue
talking to you :(

Good that you understand that.
That is one of my problems, as the manpage talks about closing of the fd,
but there are multiple ways to do that, and some are not handled the same
way.

There is obviously no need for documentation to do that, contrary to your
claim. The manpages for e.g. dup or the official sus manpages manage to
document it (mostly) correctly, so your claim that documentation must use
file descriptors when the underlying file structure is meant is disproven.

No, I have no problem with dup at all.
I have a problem with explicitlx closing file descriptors in the child will
stop events for those files to be reported in the parent.
I am sorry, but I epxlained this very clearly a number of times, but for some
reason, apart from accusing me to not understanding files and file
descritpors or (clear enough) documentation, you ignore that and instead
hammer on other problems.
To me, it seems you are not the one who understands.
