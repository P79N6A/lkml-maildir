Good catch!
Also good question...
Strictly speaking, it is not necessary to block callback invocation until
just after rcu_read_lock() returns.
It is correct as long as there is no sort of "upcall" or "callback" that
can masquerade as this task.  I know of no such thing in the Linux kernel.
In fact such a thing would break a lot of code, right?
Any tool that relied on the ->rcu_read_lock_nesting counter to deduce
RCU state would be confused by this change, but there might be other
ways of handling this.  Also, we are currently making do without such
a tool.
It should be possible to move the preempt_enable() further forward
ahead of the assignment to ->rcu_read_lock_ptr, since the assignment
to ->rcu_read_lock_ptr is strictly local.  Not sure that this is
worthwhile, thoughts?
        void
        rcu_read_lock(void)
        {
                preempt_disable();
                if (current->rcu_read_lock_nesting++ == 0) {
                        preempt_enable();
                        current->rcu_read_lock_ptr =
                                &__get_cpu_var(rcu_data).lock;
                        read_lock(current->rcu_read_lock_ptr);
                } else
                        preempt_enable();
        }
The other question is whether preempt_disable() is needed in the first
place.  The two task-structure fields are not accessed except by the
task itself.  I bet that the following is just fine:
        void
        rcu_read_lock(void)
        {
                if (current->rcu_read_lock_nesting++ == 0) {
                        current->rcu_read_lock_ptr =
                                &__get_cpu_var(rcu_data).lock;
                        read_lock(current->rcu_read_lock_ptr);
                }
        }
Thoughts?
					Thanx, Paul
