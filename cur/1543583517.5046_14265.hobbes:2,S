Yes, I see the difference, but I'm not sure that it will work as
intended.
offset must be a multiple of the alignment, everything else won't work.
In which cases an offset > alignment is really a win?
Obviously using offset 32 bytes for a structure with a 64 byte hot zone
means that 2 slabs with a different "color" compete for the same cache
lines [just assuming 32 byte cache lines for simplicity] in 50% of the
cases, but otoh offset==64 halfs the number of possible colors.
