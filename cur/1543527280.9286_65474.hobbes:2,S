...fine. Once again the neverending proc
"format/compatiblity/parsing/performance"
discussion.
IMHO the only serious point against /proc [here and in the discussion
sysctl() vs.
/proc] is the formatting issue (performance set aside). 
SO: Why don't you consider introducing *binary* proc files in addition
to human readable ones?
E.G.:
meminfo would be paralleled by a binary file meminfo.b and a struct
proc_meminfo 
{...} in <linux/proc_fmts.h>. Then there would be no problem with parsing
anymore.
The human being :-) reads meminfo and the C program reads meminfo.b and type
casts it to struct proc_meminfo [introducing once again a flat namespace
:-)].
