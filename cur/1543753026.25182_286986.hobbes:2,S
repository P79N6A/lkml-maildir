I maintain that it's ambiguous. And read(2) makes it clear that short
reads can happen any time, any where. Further, your interpretation
makes for a nonsensical API as it implies being uninterruptible for
arbitrary lengths of time. 
Changing the longstanding, sensible code to match a silly and highly
non-standard interpretation of the documentation doesn't fix the
problem in apps either. Presumably they'll still be running on kernels
older than 2.6.11 and I believe most *BSDs have /dev/urandom as well.

That's a separate problem. I'll take a look at fixing that.
