Currently I'm not sure, which I was really using.  I think it was the
right one, because dmesg changed.  But anyhow, I will retest if I made
it wrong.

What a pity.

OK, I thought it to be better to have 64bit + some overhead.  I will
change that.

Any hints how I can debug that?
Currently I cannot retest, but I will dig into it again and rereport.
Thanks for your answer.
