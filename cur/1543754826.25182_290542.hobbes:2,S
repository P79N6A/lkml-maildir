 Looks like you went 2.6.7, 2.6.8, 2.6.8.1 - you didn't *need* 2.6.8.1,
2.6.9 is against 2.6.8 not 2.6.8.1.  So, when you applied 2.6.9 you got
rejections (at a minimum, the top level Makefile, but the other stuff
from 2.6.8.1 should have rejected because it had already been applied).
From there onwards, the top level Makefile still contains the 2.6.8.1
version info and doesn't match what the next patch is looking to change.
 Whenever you apply patches, you need to make sure there are no errors!
e.g. use 'find' to look for '*.rej' files.
