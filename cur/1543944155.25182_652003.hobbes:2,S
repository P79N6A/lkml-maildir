See my response to Arjan for how this is going to be very difficult to
do, unless you are willing to have patches in -next that are not in any
other tree.

It's possible to do in a series of patches, yes, but again, development
happens in parallel, with no one stopping for anyone else, and that's
fine, we work it out when we send stuff to Linus at merge time.
So with that parallel development effort, there are problems like this,
I just want you to be aware of it and plan properly for it, as it is
going to happen...
