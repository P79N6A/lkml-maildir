Ok, this is probably a long shot, but try:
setpci -s 00:00.0 67.b=11
setpci -s 00:00.0 68.b=4f
setpci -s 00:00.0 6d.b=47
setpci -s 00:00.0 9a.b=0a
setpci -s 00:00.0 9b.b=1d
after a cold boot, and then see if that changes the behaviour. My
suspicion is that Windows enables some northbridge features that affect
the behaviour of the system in suspend. Working out /what/ would be much
easier with datasheets, but ATI and VIA don't seem willing to provide
them (if anyone could provide me with northbridge PCI configuration
register specs for any non-Intel chipsets, that would be astonishingly
helpful)
