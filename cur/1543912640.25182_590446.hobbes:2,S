Subject: [PATCH] Patch pvr2 driver to allow development of maple bus driver
To: "Antonino A. Daplas" <adaplas@gmail.com>
This patch makes the PVR2 VBLANK interrupt on the SEGA Dreamcast
shareable - a small but necessary change to enable ongoing efforts to
develop a driver for the maple bus on the Dreamcast. (Maple is Sega's
proprietary serial interface for the Dreamcast and can be set to
synchronise dma transfers to the VBLANK).
This has no impact on the performance of the PVR2.
