Hmm, thanks for that. It does sound like it is deadlocking via
commit_write(). OTOH, it seems like it could be using the page
before it is uptodate -- it _may_ only be dealing with uptodate
data at that point... but if so, why even read_cache_page at
all?
However, it is a regression. So unless David can come up with a
more satisfactory approach, I guess we'd have to go with your
patch.
