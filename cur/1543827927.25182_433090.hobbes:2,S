I'm not able to get -mm tree from GIT. In
http://git.kernel.org/.../smurf/linux-trees.git/refs/tags/
 I can see
the most recent tags like v2.6.17-rc6-mm2 but cg-clone
http://git.kernel.org/.../smurf/linux-trees.git
 gives me only
2.6.16-rc3 :(
I tried "cg-fetch v2.6.17-rc6-mm2" which seemed to fetch some more
tags, then played with git-checkout & friends but still can't get the
most recent source tree.
How do I do that? Best if I could still fetch updates in the same tree later.
RTFM is all right if followed by a link to TFM ;-)
Thanks
Goo
