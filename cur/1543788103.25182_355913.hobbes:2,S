Chris pointed out privately that the LTP rename14 test always
creates a directory in /tmp and runs from there (hidden
in an ltp library call tst_tmpdir()), not from the current
working directory. So, my tests weren't really running on
tmpfs. So, I commented out the tst_tmpdir() call in the test
forcing it to run on tmpfs and immediately I got the following
errors -
llm22:/test # ./rename14

Andi, does this look any familiar ? This is on a 2-CPU x86_64 system
running 2.6.14-rc3 (UP kernel though).
Thanks
