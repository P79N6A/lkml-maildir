Well, I don't think it matters much either way because we mostly test by
checking out of svn and buliding against -mm or patched distro kernels.  I'd
leave the details up to you and Joel (who maintains our ocfs2 git) -- whatever
is easiest for you guys.

So, speaking of which, are there any barriers to merging OCFS2 now?  I think
Christoph's concerns (silly /proc files, vma walking, endian stuff) have been
addressed.
