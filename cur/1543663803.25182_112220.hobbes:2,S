Hello folks,
I've just had an odd occurance with a USB keyboard setup where the 
shift / alt / control keys became stuck.  The only way to get sane 
control of the system back was to unplug the usb keyboard and plug 
it back in.  Note that upon plugging it back in, the system logged 
a few unknown scancode messages, which seems a bit odd.  Any ideas 
if this is the fault of the keyboard or the driver?  Info on any 
experiences might be helpful, especially if someone else is using a 
Logitech iTouch keyboard.  Cheers,
		-bben
