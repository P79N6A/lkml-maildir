[PATCH] I2C PPC4xx IIC driver: 0-length transaction temporary fix
this patch adds temporary fix for 0-length requests (e.g. SMBUS_QUICK) to PPC4xx
IIC driver. This i2c controller doesn't support such transactions and this patch
just restores previous driver version behavior making SMBUS_QUICK-based bus scan
at least partially usable. This is temporary kludge until correct bit-banging
emulation is implemented.
