You seem to be getting corruptions in at least 2 days for now, though.
And reiserfs seems to trigger the problem even faster (and may be
even more faster if you enable CONFIG_REISERFS_CHECK).

There is still huge field to look at.

diff is 20M in size.

There were not much changes in reiserfs. All those patches can easily be
reverted just for verification purposes. Let me know when you are ready/want
to test this variant and I will send you a diff.

Well, suspects are all used drivers, VM, filesystem itself, arch code.

Lots of changes, 2.4.20->2.4.21 was a long trip.

Yes, I did.
Now if only we can get someone to reproduce your problems...

Yes, whenever you decide you have waited long enough (provided that it won't
crash) and decide to stop testing, please run fsck on that testing fs.

It only enables some more checks, not debug output.
