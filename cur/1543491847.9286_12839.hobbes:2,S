Hi,
	I was trying knfsd, locks and file attr. cache on nfs.
First, sendmail and pine don't work well if pine works over nfs. I tried
the fcntl function over nfs mounted files and it's ok, but I missed
mails if I delete a message in pine and then <quit> while a message was
arriving. I supossed that KNFSD could solve the lock problems on nfs, I
see that at least pine doesn't lock well against sendmail (8.9.3).
I am always using noac in my fstab options, but trying with pine I
realized that it takes up to 60 seconds to "see" new messages. That was
too suspicious, so I added the "acregmax=10" to nfs option and since then
pine takes no more that 10 seconds to see the messages (I guess it reads
the last modified field).
I thought "noac" invalidated _all_ attributes's caches. It seems it
doesn't, which brings me to think that presently is not _possible_ to have
reliable nfs shared mailbox directories in Linux .
Or, again, am I missing something else?
Thanks.
