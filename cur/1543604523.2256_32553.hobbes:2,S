Hi Alexander,
just a short comment: I got a host with PIII-500 and the same problem. A
partition on primary IDE (single partition for whole drive) vanished during use
of 2.4.10(SuSE 7.3)/11. System works flawlessly otherwise. It is booting from
SCSI, ide was only data :-). It has 384 MB RAM.
Regards,
Stephan
