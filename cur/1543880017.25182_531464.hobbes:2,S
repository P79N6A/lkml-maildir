Dunno about that, but here's a possibly related datapoint.  I reported
to Ingo yesterday that I was sometimes losing control of my GUI (KDE)
under heavy IO.  I just reproduced it in mainline rc7.  If I start a
bonnie, and click around popping windows to the foreground, then poke
KDE's menu button, I may lose all GUI capability for a _very_ long time.
Here, with bonnie, that means until it gets past writing with putc, and
moves on to rewrite.  Ages.
