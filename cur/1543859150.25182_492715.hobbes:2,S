Under US law, the distinction is between works that are copyrightable 
themselves as "derivative works" and works that are derived from others, 
but aren't copyrightable. Provided you're allowed to ship aggregate works, 
the question is whether the output of "ld" is a copyrightable work 
distinct from the inputs.
I'd agree that "ar", like "mkisofs", doesn't create a derived work, but I 
think that "objcopy" does create a derived work, and "ld" does too, by 
virtue of modifying the objects it takes to resolve symbols. Now, you 
could distribute to somebody an ar archive of your program, and the 
recipient (given fair use rights to the copy of the program they received) 
could do "gcc program.a -o program" to link it. But I don't think you 
automatically get the right (under the "mere aggregation" permission) to 
distribute the result of relocating the symbols of gnutls around those of 
your program and vice versa, along with modifying the references to 
external symbols from each of these to point to specific locations.
