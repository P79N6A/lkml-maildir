Hi,
I have a cdrom burnt by a friend with W2000 (I know, friends don't let
friends use W ;-) which has (at least) one directory on it which I
cannot
see when mounting the disk under linux. I am using kernel 2.4.4 and
the mount command is the usual
mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom -t iso9660
I have Joliet compiled into the kernel too. I can send by private email
the
first 120 blocks or so of the disk if anyone is interested. I looked at
this
with hexlify and can see the mysterious directory (s?) which is called
'sturf'.
Thanks,
Richard
P.S. Incidentally, there is an undefined symbol in video/media/buz.c --
KMALLOC_MAXSIZE, which I found by accidentally trying to build this
module even though I do not have the requisite hardware 8-)
