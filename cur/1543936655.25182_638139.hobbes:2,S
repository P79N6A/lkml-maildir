The main thing for pxa2xx would be the interrupt enable callback and
possibly also the acc_shutdown() function depending on what the startup
function had to do for the board.  If there were platform data then at
least some of the module options (AC97 link slot, for example) ought to
have at least defaults supplied that way too.  However...

It's straightforward for something discovered using the platform bus but
unfortunately these controllers are AC97 devices and are discovered via
the AC97 bus.  This makes life harder - I can't see any sensible way of
getting platform data to describe the machine to the driver.  Hopefully
I'm missing something here but if not the options are limited.

That's a concern I share - you'll likely end up with either that or
ifdefs, neither of which is ideal.  Being able to use platform data
would be much nicer for all these drivers, not just pxa2xx-wm97xx.
