hold_freezer_for_task()->thaw_process(p) will wake up the task. Or the
caller of refrigerator will notice "!frozen()". Note that refrigerator()
sets PF_FROZEN under task_lock().
In fact we have the same issue when thaw_tasks()->thaw_process(p) happens
when the freezing fails. In that case 'p' may be not frozen.

Probably yes... but if we are speaking about kthrad_stop() only, this could
be afaics solved in more simple way, as Rafael suggests.
