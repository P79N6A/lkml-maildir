A few patch protocol things:
- Please always prepare patches in `patch -p1' form
- Include a Signed-off-by: as per Documentation/SubmittingPatches,
  section 11.
- Avoid including two copies of the patch in the one email.  Inlined plain
  text is preferred, ext/plain attachments are grudgingly accepted.
I descrambled the patch, fixed a reject and queued it up in the -mm tree
for Dmitry's consideration, thanks.
