Hi all, 
Since 2.6 is turning into a continuous release, how about just taking
the last 2.6 release every six months and backport security fixes to it
for the next half year ?
This seems what distributions are starting to do with 2.6 anyway, the
only thing they need is some sort of agreement on the stabilization fork
dates so they can share the fix pool work (and add whatever value-added
enhancements they want over the result).
ie stable kernel releases used to be feature-driven but major OSS
projects like GNOME have shown you could/should do date-driven releases
once you got to the continuous development stage.
Regards,
