At one point, I had some code in there to stick the names of the
slots into a linked list and walk through it to try and detect
duplicate slot names, but after a few iterations, the cases I was
dealing with, it turned out to be easier to refcount them.
[my machines did not have colliding names between hp and non-hp
slots, it was more like seeing the same SxFy object appear
multiple times in the namespace and trying to create them
multiple times.]
It wasn't the IBM machine that was breaking; it was Fujitsu. They
were returning an error code (the numerical value 1023) when I
called the _SUN method on a slot object that existed in the ACPI
namespace but was not present (as reported by the _STA method).
By the time I got that error report, I'd already dropped the
duplicate name detection code, and was letting the kobject
infrastructure warn about duplicate names because for my test
cases, refcounting was a better solution.
[Kenji-san from Fujitsu seemed to be ok with the progress I'd
made at the time, he can speak up if he's changed his mind ;)]
But even that is not the error case you're describing, where
there is clear name collision of two physical slots in the
machine, one being hotplug, the other non-hotplug.
Maybe I would have to add some duplicate name detection code back
in there but...

Yes -- totally agreed. And I'd like to see actual examples of
name collisions or userspace breakage to get a better idea of how
to handle real world problems rather than writing some crummy
code based on what my limited imagination can think of.
So how to get this test coverage? -mm? linux-next?
Thanks.
