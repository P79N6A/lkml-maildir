Subject: [PATCH] Update emacs indentation instructions.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

For quite some time now, Emacs has supported multiple coding styles,
including one very close to the Linux style.  Update the Emacs
configuration instructions in the documentation to reflect this.
