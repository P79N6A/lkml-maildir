Well, I did a very simple implementation entirely local to
arch/ppc/kernel, that basically calls timer_interrupt on every do_IRQ, I
don't change timer_interrupt (our implementation already knows how to
"catch up" already if missed ticks and knows how to deal beeing called
to early as well). Then, when going to idle loop, I "override" the
decrementer interrupt setting to be further in the future if
next_timer_interrupt() returns more than 1.
Strangely, I got not measurable improvement on power consumption despite
putting the CPU longer into NAP mode. Note that this may be very
different with earlier (G3 notably) CPUs, since G3 users repeately
reported me havign a significant loss in battery life with HZ=1000
Later, I'll do some stats to check how long I really slept, and see if
it's worth, when I predict a long sleep, flushing the cache and going
into a deeper PM mode where cache coherency is disabled too.
Ben.
