Nope... I tried several patches from Tejun, and also some that Jeff posted
to linux-ide, but no luck. The only way to have this DVD-RW working is to
use irqpoll on the command line...
Sorry to have been unclear....
To complete, here are some more output from the machine : 
 - a dmesg without irqpoll,
 - a dmesg with irqpoll,
 - a copy of /proc/interrupts
