Subject: 2.3.27 always keeping 15M free?

Good day, all,
	I've got a P90 laptop with 40M *1.  Somewhere between 2.3.24 and
2.3.27-final the kernel started keeping 15M or more free all the time.  
On a 40M laptop that makes a big difference. *smile*
	Here's /proc/meminfo:
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  39653376 23949312 15704064        0   118784 12414976
Swap: 132083712 24813568 107270144
MemTotal:     38724 kB
MemFree:      15336 kB
MemShared:        0 kB
Buffers:        116 kB
Cached:       12124 kB
HighTotal:        0 kB
HighFree:         0 kB
LowTotal:     38724 kB
LowFree:      15336 kB
SwapTotal:   128988 kB
SwapFree:    104756 kB
	Is there any chance that the kernel is not allocating DMA'able
memory for some reason?
	I've tried "echo 20 39 50 >/proc/sys/vm/freepages", but the system
still keeps 15-16M free even if I try to open new programs.  Echo'ing "1"
into overcommit_memory (which was 0) didn't help either.  BTW - shouldn't
the default be 1 so the system will overcommit memory?  Just wondering.
	Here are the memory related boot messages:
totalpages: 00002830
Memory: 38668k/41152k available (0k kernel code, 0k reserved, 0k data, 0k init, 0k highmem)
Buffer-cache hash table entries: 1024 (order: 0, 4096 bytes)
Page-cache hash table entries: 16384 (order: 4, 65536 bytes)
Freeing unused kernel memory: 56k freed
Adding Swap: 128988k swap-space (priority -1)
	The entries from /proc/sys/vm:
[root@sparrow vm]# cat bdflush
40      500     64      256     500     3000    500     1884    2
[root@sparrow vm]# cat buffermem
2       10      60
[root@sparrow vm]# cat freepages
20      39      50
[root@sparrow vm]# cat kswapd
512     32      32
[root@sparrow vm]# cat overcommit_memory
1
[root@sparrow vm]# cat page-cluster
4
[root@sparrow vm]# cat pagecache
2       15      75
[root@sparrow vm]# cat pagetable_cache
25      50
	The (hopefully) relevant portions of the kernel config:
CONFIG_M586TSC=y
CONFIG_X86_INVLPG=y
CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM=y
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G is not set
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G is not set
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
	What kinds of things could I do to help track this down?  I'll
start off by going back to an older kernel and figure out where the
problem started.  With a 2.5 hour compile, though, it may take a while.
*smile*
	Cheers,

*1 I'd upgrade it if I could, but that's all it'll take.
