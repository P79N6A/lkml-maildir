People are using the interface, so I don't think changing it because
"it's nicer this way" is worthwhile: Ingo's "new syscall" patch has
backwards compat code for the old syscalls.  That's fugly 8(
So I'd say if we're going to multiplex, then overloading is easiest,
and in fact already done for FUTEX_FD.
But it's an issue over which sane people can disagree, IMHO.

Comment says: /* Must be "naturally" aligned */.  This used to be true
in a much earlier version of the code, now AFAICT the requirement test
should be:
	/* Handling futexes on multiple pages?  -ETOOHARD */
	if (pos_in_page + sizeof(u32) > PAGE_SIZE)
		return -EINVAL;
Ingo?
Thanks for the comments!
Rusty.
