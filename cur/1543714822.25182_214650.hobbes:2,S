Hi,
since on one side ATARAID support has vanished from 2.6 and on the other
side some parties are pushing for an enhanced MD driver in the kernel, why
 don't we do the setup and metadata handling of all those types of RAID in
userspace?
I got positive feedback by private mail from several kernel developers for
the last incarnations of raiddetect, so if you disagree, speak up now.
Raiddetect is a program to find vendor software RAID superblocks, analyze
them for validity, group them by RAID vendor and (later on) set them up
via MD/DM. It is small (~35kB compiled statically against klibc) and
designed to be run from initrd/initramfs.
raiddetect now supports the following metadata formats:
-Promise RAID
-Highpoint RAID
-Medley RAID
-Intel RAID
If you want support for another metadata format, please tell me which and
I'll try to add it. Patches are preferred ;-) My current wishlist is:
- Adaptec ASR HostRAID
- DDF RAID
Hot-add and hot-remove features can be added easily if raiddetect is
called by an udev rule on block device removal/insertion. If raiddetect
stays loaded into memory or is allowed to save its state, hotplug events
will not trigger any access to devices not related to that particular RAID
array.
It seems that there are some host adapter drivers out there implementing
their own RAID engine which could be consolidated into a single RAID
"library" instead. If you know about such drivers, please speak up.
The following issues remain still to be sorted out:

This is on hold until I receive feedback from Greg K-H whether this will
be accepted into udev or not.

Do you have an idea about the generic FIXMEs listed above?

Since the patch is already too big (~42kB) for some mailing lists, please
get the latest version from
http://www.hailfinger.org/carldani/linux/patches/raiddetect/
The patch is against the latest udev bitkeeper tree and applies fine to
udev-024 if you prefer working with officially released versions.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
