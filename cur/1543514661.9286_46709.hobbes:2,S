Andre, as you may remember from a prior email, I am anxious to get my
HPT366 controller chipset working.  At present I am using 2.2.12 with
patches: ide.2.2.12.19991014.patch & raid0145-19990824-2.2.11. The system
fails to boot when a drive is connected to either IDE3 or IDE4. In my
case, it's more important to me that I can use the 3rd and 4th channels,
than whether they run at 33 or 66. And of course I would be happy to
supply additional information to you at any time.  But I know you must be
a busy guy.
Anyway here is my question:
Do you have a web site where I check in from time to time, to see the
current status of your efforts and the latest patches and what they
address:  Here is the web address I am using at the moment, is there a
better one?   
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hedrick/
Best Regards,
Robert Laughlin
