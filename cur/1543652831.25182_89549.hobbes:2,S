Has my 2.5 Problem Report Status postings been useful?  If so, when I 
discussed this with Martin one of the roles we agreed I would play was 
taking bug reports from the list and adding them to bugzilla.  I'll also 
be a "filter" for some of the issues discussed in this thread, sort of a 
janitor if you will.  
My question is how should compile failures figure into the bug database?  
Most of the compile failures are typos or thinkos that get quickly fixed.  
Should they get tracked, or dismissed quickly unless they linger on.  I 
didn't track simple compile failures in my list.
