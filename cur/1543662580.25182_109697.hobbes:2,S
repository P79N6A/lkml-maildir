The only change is to accept ^AHxxxxx as well as ^Ahxxxxx as the per file
checksum.  I'm almost positive that someone posted a patch to the kernel
which made CSSC like BK files.
If the BK files are compressed, you have to uncompress them first and you
can't use gunzip to do so, you have to use BK.  You could teach CSSC to
read our compressed files if you like, there is no secret to how we do 
that, the top part of the file containing the graph is uncompressed and
the rest is compressed, so you have to tickle the code into being able to
start uncompressing at an offset other than 0.
The only other difference I know of is that we support files without newlines
at the end of the file and CSSC doesn't (and I don't blame them, it is 
dramatically more difficult than you might think at first glance).
