From fs/namespace.c:do_loopback, the function which does bind mounts:
	if (check_mnt(nd->mnt) && (!recurse || check_mnt(old_nd.mnt))) {
check_mnt() verifies that a mountpoint is in the same namespace as the
current process.  recurse is set for --rbind mounts, but not --bind mounts.
Notice how old_nd.mnt is explicitly _not_ checked for being in the current
namespace when doing --bind?
That says to me that Al thought about this case, and coded for it...
(I'm still not clear why the check_mnt() calls are needed at all, though).
