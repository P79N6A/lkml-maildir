Cardbus compiles as a module ok on my PICO Consul (Pentium 233 MMX, i82365
PCMCIA port) but gives 'unresolved symbols' and when loaded.
# depmod -dae
/lib/modules/2.3.36/pcmcia/pcmcia_core.o: unresolved symbol(s)
        pci_setup_device
/lib/modules/2.3.36/pcmcia/yenta.o: unresolved symbol(s)
        pci_find_parent_resource
        probe_irq_mask
Seems like this is something to do with PCI, but PCI is compiled in.
(Sorry if anyones already posted a fix, but i subsribe to the digest 
list)
