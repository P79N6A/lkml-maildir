Hi,
I have to say that when I brought this subject up, I didn't realise
quite how tricky this was going to be, however...

So if I've understood this correctly, the dentries created upon mkdir
live until such time as they are removed at some later date, presumably
with rmdir?
When creating the tree, would it be possible to build it starting from
the bottom and working towards the point of attachment and then to not
actually attach it until the last moment? That way it would not be
visible from userland until it was linked into the existing dir and that
solves the locking issue for mkdir I think.
As you say, rmdir seems the harder problem, but again, is it possible to
separate the unlink operation from the destruction of the tree by
keeping the tree, after its been unlinked, until the last userland
reference has gone away? At least I assume that is why the locking is
there. I may be a bit off the mark, but it seems like this is quite
similar to how the VFS does umount, so maybe there are some hints in
that code which may help us solve this issue?
Steve.
