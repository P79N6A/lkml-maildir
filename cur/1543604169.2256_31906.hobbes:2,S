They work, but not "fine".  There are performance issues with
Thunderbird-core Athlons in SMP configurations that may slow them down
somewhat.

Non-MP Athlons to now have all been Thunderbird (or earlier) cores.  MP
Athlons are Palomino cores.  The new Athlon XP is a Palomino core.  The
Palomino has specific fixes for MP operation (no more slowdowns due to
SMP), and various performance improvements.
If you don't want to fork out the extra cash for the "official" MP
Athlons, at least buy the XP variant.
