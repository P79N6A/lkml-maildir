Personally, I'd like to see both, but in separate files:
 1. /proc/irq/current would be useful for debugging the
    interrupt usage of a device and its driver.
 2. /proc/irq/all would be useful for when one has an ISA
    bus non-PnP card to plug into a computer and needs to
    determine an IRQ it can be jumpered to.
However, this is probably unlikely to be accepted.
Best wishes from Riley.
