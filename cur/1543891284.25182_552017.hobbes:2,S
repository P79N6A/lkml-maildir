Why does it do that? Could we supply a better interface
for whatever it is trying to do here?

Bad idea imho. swiotlb mappings should always lead to printk by default
because it is pretty dangerous.
One possible solution for this I could think of would be to define a
new pci_map_sg_couldfail() or similar that doesn't warn and use a weak
fallback just calling pci_map_sg on other IOMMU implementations.
