That code is riddled with bugs, by the way.
It fails to close/clean-up on just about every exit path.
But apart from that, it does appear to issue the command.
Another way to the same thing is with "hdparm -E",
which contrary to my earlier posting actually does
seem to work already with libata.

Can you define "doesn't work" for me?
How can I test this to see if it works one way or another ?
The command issue (ioctl) is not returning -1.
