Well 30 sec was a good timeout value. The real problem was that we must
have a two level buffer-dirty-percentage. The first one will wakeup
bdflush. The second `limit' one will wait for I/O compleatation. And
bdflush is _not_ sync(2)!!, and so we can stop bdflush as far as the dirty
buffers are lower than the lower percentage limit (we don't need to sync
back to disk every dirty buffer as happens now every time bdflush get
wakenup).
Also set_writetime was wrong according to me. If a buffer is marked dirty,
it's inuse and so we must always give it a good timeout. The point is that
the buffer flushtime has to going on only when the dirty buffers are a
few. It's only intended to avoid _old_ not used buffers to stay around.
BTW, flushtime = 0 special case was also a jiffy-wrap design bug (minor
issue I know ;).
I also found another new major problem. in bforget we care that the buffer is
not inuse and that it's not under I/O. And we obviously want to forget also
dirty-not-under-IO buffers, but we are not setting b_state to 0, so we may
put on the freelist a dirty buffer.
So finally my third patch (the one quoted abuve) in the previous email was
bogus. This new patch instead will fix these issues properly giving a great
improvement here. Now writes are cached properly and cvs rdiff performances
are impressive.
Also process stalling while writing large files seems to be gone
completly away (sleeping with ndirty == 0 in bdflush was really not
needed and was harming really too much).
Here is the new "third" patch against the two previous ones (the two ones in
the first email of this thread):

PS. I am releasing now 2.2.5_arca6.gz with this new stuff in (and the
    b_state = 0 was harming here, in first place I confused it with a
    pagemap-lru memleak ;).
