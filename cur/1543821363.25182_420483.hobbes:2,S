This module implements two distinct ideas:
(1) Multiple superusers with distinct UIDs.
More than one root on a system I think is generally regarded as a bad 
idea.  I'm not sure why you'd use a scheme like this instead of, say, sudo 
or custom setuid helpers for specific tasks -- whatever the case, I think 
such issues can be addressed entirely in userspace.
(2) Partially decomposing the superuser and protecting some users from 
    some decomposed superusers, and decomposing CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
This is a special-case security policy hard-coded into the kernel.  It 
lacks a clear design rationale, and does not seem amenable to analysis, as 
its access control coverage is incomplete.
As already suggested, it may be worth looking at just decomposing 
CAP_SYS_ADMIN, although it's not clear how do to this correctly for the 
general case.
