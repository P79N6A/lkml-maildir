But is it efficient to make every application that reads files have to
know how to get inside a tar file, just to read its contents?  That
seems like a massive duplication of effort.  Better to have the contents
accessible via a separate stream, in the same namespace.  Fix it once in
the kernel vs. fix it in umpteen apps.
The key point here is that the expressive power of the system is greatly
reduced by having a fragmented namespace.  Of course there are any
number of ways for an app to find out what is in a tar file, but
exporting all of that information in a unified namespace is nontrivial
and much more interesting.
