PS: with your approach negative entries are dead meat - they won't be
caught used unless you look at them exactly at the moment of d_lookup().
Welcome to massive lookups in /bin due to /usr/bin stuff (and no, shell
own cache doesn't help - it's not shared; think of scripts).
IOW. keeping dcache/icache size low is not a good thing, unless you
have a memory pressure that requires it. More agressive kupdate _is_
a good thing, though - possibly kupdate sans flushing buffers, so that
it would just keep the icache clean and let bdflush do the actual IO.
