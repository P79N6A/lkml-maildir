Hmm, maybe the timer interrupt should be 99 and the rest say 50.
Wouldn't it be bad if you had a fully loaded jackd (DSP load in JACK is
the proportion of the process cycle to the period time; in a fully
loaded jack setup the clients are using all the available time) and
jackd + the soundcard IRQ's RT priorities are higher than the timer
interrupt?  Seems like you could starve the timer interrupt
indefinitely.
In fact, the only IRQ thread that currently _needs_ to be lower prio
than the others is IDE - the others all execute quickly enough to only
cause a problem at _extreme_ latencies that you would never use in the
real world, at least for audio/JACK.  Last time I checked no other
hardirq ran for more than about 50 usecs.  With Jens' patch to move IDE
bh processing into a softirq, I suspect the relative priorities of the
IRQ threads would not matter at all.
