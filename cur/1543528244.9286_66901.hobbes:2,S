   Softnet is certainly there too. But I thought that Lawrence was trying the
   filesystem-only portion of the simulated dbench.
   Lawrence? Are you using the full dbench with sockets and networking, or
   are you just replaying the IO part of it?
I think he's just doing the disk portion of dbench.
Softnet could be to blame in that there may be a salient
bad side-effect to how "classical BH" is implemented in terms
of the new software irqs.
Is everyone seeing this problem using SCSI?  That would be a good
reference point, because SCSI command done processing is still
implemented as a "classical BH".
One would also wish to take a look at how the various task queues
behave in the new code as well.
