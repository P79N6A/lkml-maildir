Formally you are correct but from my POV this sounds casuistic and
fit for a patent lawyer.  You were "recently advised not to change
these symbols" and you stated that you will not. So instead you did
an end run and you removed an old interface and introduced a
replacement; but this time with EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL - which has the
same effect as what you told you will not do.

Well, I gave an example in my original question.  Yes, I asked them
to contact you.  If they will do that I have no idea.
