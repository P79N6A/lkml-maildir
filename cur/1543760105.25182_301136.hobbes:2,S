These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness. It is 
configurable to any workload but the default ck* patch is aimed at the 
desktop and ck*-server is available with more emphasis on serverspace.

Split patches and a server specific patch available.
Note:
Please do not set the mapped value any higher than the default (66) with a 
hardmaplimit on. This will bring an out of memory condition easily. Try the 
default setting and you'll find it avoids swap much more aggressively than 
higher mapped settings did on previous versions.
Added since 2.6.11-ck1:
+s10.5_s10.6.diff
Staircase scheduler update. Somehow the merge from 2.6.10-staircase10.5 to 
2.6.11 included an experimental change that was never meant to be part of 
staircase10.5. This patch removes that change so brings it back to the 10.5 
design. Some slowdown was experienced over time on slower hardware and this 
patch fixes it. To avoid confusion the version number has been updated. 
Thanks to Martin Josefsson for tracking this down!
