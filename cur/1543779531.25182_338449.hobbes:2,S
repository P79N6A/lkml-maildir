If you have 130HZ in single user mode, it's some kernel driver.
You could printk the the next timer, then grep for that in System.map:
--- linux-2.6.orig/kernel/timer.c	2005-06-27 07:51:58.000000000 -0700
+++ linux-2.6/kernel/timer.c	2005-06-28 06:57:27.000000000 -0700
@@ -571,6 +571,7 @@
 				expires = nte->expires;
 		}
 	}
+	printk("next: %08x\n", nte->function);
 	spin_unlock(&base->t_base.lock);
 	return expires;
 }
Of course the console will be useless with this patch :)
I really need to do the timertop utility at some point...
