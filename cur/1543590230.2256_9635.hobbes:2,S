So lets fix it and make it look for the swap counts.

My point is that its _ok_ for us to check if the page is a dead swap cache
page _without_ the lock since writepage() will recheck again with the page
_locked_. Quoting you two messages back: 
"But it is important to re-calculate the deadness after getting the lock.
Before, it was just an informed guess. After the lock, it is knowledge."
