I am seeing the same problem here too (Powerstack II with OF).
Using the serial console does not change to behavior in any way, it is
just stuck after the transmission of the kernel and no further
information is printed.
I even let it stay this way for a long time (read: over 12 hours) and
nothing changed.
The only difference is: Is see this problem since the 2.6.4 (or maybe
even 2.6.3) kernel. I'm a bit short on time right now, so I am
currently not able to specify a correct -BK-release. 
At least I know, 2.6.1 and 2.6.2-rc2 were able to boot, until the
problem with the Tulip/3Com cards hits me
