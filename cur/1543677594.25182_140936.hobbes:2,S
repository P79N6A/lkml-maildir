Practical or not, when you put sysfs object into a structure, you take
full responsibility for the lifetime of that structure.  Period.
Note that problems exist even when kernel is non-modular.  Even if code
stays in place, the data getting freed under you is just as bad.  And
that can trivially happen without any modules.
