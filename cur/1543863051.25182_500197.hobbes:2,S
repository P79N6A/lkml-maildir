Greetings all;
I have a card reader plugged into a usb port.  I recognizes a 512meg pny 
cf card just fine, but wwhen I plug in a 256meg Lexar cf, the led comes 
on, but there is no reaction from linux. /dev/sda is not created, 
nothing.
Is this a kernel config problem, or is this particular cf known to be a 
bad bird?
