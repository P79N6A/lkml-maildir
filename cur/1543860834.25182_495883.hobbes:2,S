  there's certainly some cleanup/speedup that could be done regarding
these numerous "memset(...,0,PAGE_SIZE) calls.
  first, there the obvious 1:1 replacement with a call to
"clear_page()" ***if that's appropriate***.
  second, there's some possible simplification, given snippets like
this one from arch/sparc/mm/sun4c.c
	pte = (pte_t *)__get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_REPEAT);
        if (pte)
                memset(pte, 0, PAGE_SIZE);
which seems to be an obvious candidate for replacement with:
	pte = get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_REPEAT)
no?
  finally, there is certainly some "double zeroing" going on, as with
this snippet from drivers/atm/eni.c:
	...
	eni_dev->rx_map = (struct atm_vcc **) get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL);
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        if (!eni_dev->rx_map) {
                printk(KERN_ERR DEV_LABEL "(itf %d): couldn't get free page\n",
                    dev->number);
                free_page((unsigned long) eni_dev->free_list);
                return -ENOMEM;
        }
        memset(eni_dev->rx_map,0,PAGE_SIZE);	// redundant, no?
	...
  so, yes, there does appear to be room for cleanup/speedup.
