This makes "blacklist X" equivalent to "install X /bin/true" right?  i.e
"ignore it".

Well, a module mentioned in hotplug's blacklist file would be a pretty
good candidate for exclusion from your initramfs builder.  Existing
install commands are already trouble for initramfs building, since they
can do arbitrary things...
How about I allow "--config=-" and hotplug can use the existing
blacklists and 'sed'?
