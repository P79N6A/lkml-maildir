Are you sure that works? When I tried it didn't. I think because
asm/smp.h isn't included by linux/smp.h for !SMP.
I needed the below to make it work, but including linux/smp.h and
asm/smp.h in the same file smells a bit fishy to me... Probably
acceptable for now if you are thinking of redoing SMP processor bringup
anyway.
