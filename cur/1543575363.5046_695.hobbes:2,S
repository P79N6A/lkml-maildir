Oh, that hardly counts as news. Both the Miguel's, erm, persuasion and
his arguments themselves.
It's a real shame that nobody had shown him polymorphic typed functional
languages. Imagine Genera-like environment with LML instead of LISP and
G-machine as the engine. _That_ has plumbing power at least equivalent
to shell. And yes, it can very well use CORBA for talking to G-machine.
I would prefer something like 9P, though. Moreover, it can easily
incorporate normal scripting. But use of strongly-typed glue without
polymorphism... Ew. There is a reason why scripting languages are not
done that way.
If you are trying to design an OS you might as well try to make it
simple and elegant...
BTW, gotta love the argument about UI consistency as a reason to make
everything monlithic - one might think that separating UI code from
the payload one would simplify making the former consistent, just
by virtue of having less code to take care of... Especially since
UI programmers tend to be, well, a distinctly separate bunch.
What came as real surprise was the defense of bloat. No, not the fact
in itself, but general, erm, disdain to logics. "People say that X is
bad since it has property P. But Y also has that property, Y runs on
UNIX, so P is OK". Especially since Y is a bunch of really crappy programs,
most of them either of non-UNIX origin or emulating non-UNIX ones.
Logics: F-. Rethorics: D, and that's being bloody generous...
