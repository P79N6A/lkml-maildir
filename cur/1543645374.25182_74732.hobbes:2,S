Hmm, works fine here so far, though I only have tested the parallel
port in polling mode (that's how it is set up by default).

Mine is "ST Lab PCI 2S1P IO Controller Card" - which has no serial
configuration EEPROM (there is an empty place for it on the PCB).
The 9710:9835 numbers are the generic defaults hardwired in the
NM9835 chip, not specific to any board type like "222N-2".

I haven't heard anything from the kernel people yet - any chances of
getting these changes into the official 2.4.x source?  I can make
a second patch (NetMos support) after the first one is accepted...
