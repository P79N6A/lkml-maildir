   For reasons unknown to me tsx-11 is not processing its incoming queue
   anymore. Mail to the archive team also went unanswered. Thus I have to make
   metalab the primary ftp server for my watchdog daemon.The tsx-11 version is
   pretty much outdated (3.3 vs. 4.5). 
Umm, oops.  <blush>
TSX-11 has been in <<media res>> most of the summer, since it's been in
between a (half-finished) computer upgrade, and I (and the other archive
team members) have been consumed with other activities.  In my case, it
was due to my changing jobs.  I've updated the watchdog deamon, and I
will be working on processing the rest of the incoming queue this week.
In the meantime, if you don't get an answer sent to the archive e-mail
address, please try sending mail directly to me (tytso@mit.edu).  I'll
make sure it gets dealt with.  
I should have the hardware transition finished this month, and things
should be better after that.  I apologize for the disruption and the
inconvenience.
In the meantime, of course, if you choose to change the primary location
of the watchdog deamon to another FTP server, I really can't blame you.
Again, my apologies.
