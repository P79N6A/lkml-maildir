Hi,
	2.1.133 seems to work fine, except that quake variants can't used
sound.
Quake I: 
/dev/dsp: Device or resource busy
Could not open /dev/dsp
S_Startup: SNDDMA_Init failed.
Segmentation fault
Quake II:
/dev/dsp: Device or resource busy
Could not open /dev/dsp
	I have a PPro 150 with a Sound Blaster 16 card; sound is modularized.
