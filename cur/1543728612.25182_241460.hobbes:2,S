We seem to be getting quite a few of these. In theory we could add a line
like this for every multi-lun SCSI device.
Can you instead try booting with scsi_mod.max_luns=8 (or such) or build
with SCSI_MULTI_LUN enabled?
You can also use the scsi devinfo stuff, but the above is easier and
should work fine, unless you have some device that hangs when IO is sent
to a non-zero LUN.
The same for 2.4, but AFAIR the option name is max_scsi_luns (but there is
no scsi devinfo imethod).
