It's in quilt mail (even the latest version), but since it's a script, I'll
see about fixing it manually.

I've looked at the tlb ones and they are hairy.  But we now have a few more
facilities in place so I'll revisit them.

There are 72 arrays still using NR_CPUS (though some legitimately) and 14 static
cpumask_t's and 11 "DECLARE_BITMAP(..., NR_CPUS)".
There are also about 5 patches left in my queue that need further testing with
the latest tip code.
