Consider reading up on devfs, which is now integrated into 2.4.
Basically it is a (optional) special filesystem, where a driver register
a
name for each device it serves, possibly in a subdirectory.
(I.e. all audio devices in /dev/sound/..., all scsi stuff under
/dev/scsi/...)
This device filesystem is mounted at /dev during boot, instead of having
a
/dev directory with special files.
