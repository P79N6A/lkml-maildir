The JFS issue is general to PAGE_SIZE > 4KB, pgcl-induced or not. shaggy
et al are already aware of it.
Most of the driver stuff I've seen is ioremap() of O(PAGE_SIZE) which
just gets denied so it fails to probe. IDE was worse (as usual), and
AGP needed an unusual amount of tweaking, which probably will be
typical for the graphics drivers in general. Block stuff seems to be
well-abstracted, so basically the only semantically significant needed
fix for block drivers is for 512*q->max_len < PAGE_SIZE (not yet done).
