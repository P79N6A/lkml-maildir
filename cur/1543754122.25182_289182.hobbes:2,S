This message means that if you load your module it is guaranteed to 
cause
a crash because it is the wrong version.  It would be best if you could
license your source code under the GPL and publish a set of small 
discreet
patches to the stock kernel to this list.  That way it would be included
and maintained across API revisions for you by the community.
