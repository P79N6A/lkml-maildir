CS5520 is one example. Also VIA VP2 seems to care but only very very
occasionally. On my 386 board its reliably borked without the delays
(not sure what chipset and its ISA so harder to tell)

DEC laptops hang is the well known example of that one.
I'm *for* making this change to udelay, it just has to start up with a
suitably pessimal udelay assumption until calibrated.
