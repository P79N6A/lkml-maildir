Here are the numbers from my box:
oscar% cd /usr/src/linux
oscar% time bk -r check -acv
100% |=================================================================| OK
bk -r check -acv  80.63s user 16.18s system 21% cpu 7:32.06 total
oscar% time bk clone -ql linux yy
bk clone -ql linux yy  77.57s user 23.49s system 17% cpu 9:50.51 total
