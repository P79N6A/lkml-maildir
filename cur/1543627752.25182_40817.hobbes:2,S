I use the byteswap feature to access these disks. It appears I was wrong
about the reason that I needed to use it, but the need is correct.
the fact is that for whatever reason the drives the tivo uses are
byteswapped compared to what they need to be for me to read them on an x86
system.
if another way is available I will use it, in the meantime I will not be
able to use 2.5 kernels to access those drives (since connecting and
disconnecting the drives requires a reboot this isn't a fatal flaw)
