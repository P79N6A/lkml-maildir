It's ok, I know it's "not a kernel issue". I just asked over here
 because I saw network code already converted to the new
 sk_buff code, and hoped someone could hint to a solution;
 I don't think it'd be extremely fruitful to ask Cisco since I'm
 already running a patched version of their latest official
 Linux release, which hasn't been updated for quite a while.

vpnc only started supporting hybrid-auth as of very, very
 recently; I used it before my company network turned to
 hybrid-auth-only several months ago. It's in my sights to go
 back to test vpnc-0.4.0 with the hybrid-auth support patch
 in the near future. But in the meantime I'll be stuck with
 the Cisco VPN client.
After clarifying all this, I'll respectfully ask again whether
 anyone has an idea about how to go fixing the five or so
 lines of the skb stuff impacted by the kernel changes -
 and will of course take no offense if nobody can help, while
 happily ignoring those who can only contribute what I do
 already know, that is - this isn't a kernel issue.
Thanks again in advance, ciao,
