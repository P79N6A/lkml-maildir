Looks buggy.

"Clearly" is not correct. What I bet happens is:

Notice how you do "waitpid()" for a _specific_ thread when you get a 
SIGCHLD.
How the heck do you know _which_ thread it was that exited?
In other words, I suspect that you got a SIGCHILD for some _other_ thread, 
and now you're waitpid'ing for the wrong thread. And while you do so, the 
thread you wait for may well be waiting for you to do something.
Rule: never EVER wait for a specific thread in a SIGCHLD handler. When you 
get a SIGCHLD, your signal handler should just wait for "any thread". 
Because SIGCHLD isn't specific enough (well, you could get the pid from 
siginfo, but because SIGCHLD isn't queued, that wouldn't really work 
either).
So your SIHCHLD handler should _always_ look like this:
	for (;;) {
		int status;
		int pid = waitpid(NULL, &status, WNOHANG);
		if (pid < 0)
			break;
		handle_exit(pid, status);
	}
and anything else is basically a bug in your program (well, your SIGCHLD 
handler might choose to just set a flag, and let the main loop do the 
above: that usually makes some races much simpler to handle, since the 
signal handler really _really_ shouldn't be taking any threading locks or 
anythign like that).

Fix your thing to use NULL and WNOHANG.

Probably just timing changes where strace effectively serializes something
(ie you probably have other threads that also get signals and do waitpid).
