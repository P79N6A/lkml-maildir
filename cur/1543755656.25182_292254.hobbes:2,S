I don't think Linus _can_ apply it - he doesn't have
try_acquire_console_sem() for a start.
I currently have:
add-try_acquire_console_sem.patch
update-aty128fb-sleep-wakeup-code-for-new-powermac-changes.patch
radeonfb-massive-update-of-pm-code.patch
radeonfb-build-fix.patch
And the patch which you've just send replaces
radeonfb-massive-update-of-pm-code.patch.
Please confirm that all four are needed.
Are you seriously proposing this for 2.6.11??
