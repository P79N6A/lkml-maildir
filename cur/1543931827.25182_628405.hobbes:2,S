Could this be the reason my BCM94311MCG rev 1 receives such terrible
performance with b43 but works well with bcm43xx? The device is
802.11b/g but my router is 802.11b. I filed a report on this issue
here: 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=413291
I was told by Michael that I would have to fix it myself, and I am
trying, but the learning curve is a little steep. If this is relevant,
I might at least have some direction to go in.
