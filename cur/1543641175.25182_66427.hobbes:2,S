Is this problem specific to certain versions of 2.95 gcc ?
For "static DEFINE_PER_CPU(atomic_t, fake_struct);", I get this
with gcc 2.95.4 -
.section        .percpu
        .align 4
        .type    fake_struct__per_cpu,@object
        .size    fake_struct__per_cpu,4
fake_struct__per_cpu:
        .zero   4
        .ident  "GCC: (GNU) 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease)"
It seems to be in .percpu section. I can't go back to the gcc that gave 
us problems at the moment.

Like DEFINE_PER_CPU(type, var, initializer) ?
For now, I will remain paranoic and keep the initializers.
Thanks
