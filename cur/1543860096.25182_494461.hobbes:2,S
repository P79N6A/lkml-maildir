Subject: [PATCH 28/28] V4L/DVB (5010): Cx88: Fix leadtek_eeprom tagging
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/27/91

From: Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org>
reference to .init.text: from .text between 'cx88_card_setup'
(at offset 0x68c) and 'cx88_risc_field'
Caused by leadtek_eeprom() being declared __devinit and called from
a non-devinit context.
