I followed your suggestion of installing the module-init-tools
to get around the "make modules_install" problem. I modified
the kernel Makefile to point to /usr/local:
	#DEPMOD         = /sbin/depmod
	DEPMOD          = /usr/local/sbin/depmod
I expect it's likely necessary to copy the /usr/local
copies over the / copies so that they are available to
the boot code; Perhaps not. 
I thought I check to see how you and/or others did
to for using the newer module-init-tools.
Also, do you think it's better to enable the use
frame pointer when using kgdb. In the past I thought
I had problems with modules due to my enabling the
frame pointer being used.
