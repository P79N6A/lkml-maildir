First, a definition. I'll use "privileged" to mean setuid, setgid,
capability enhanced, or any combination of the three.
An operating system can be behave in one of a few ways:
a. Allow privileged scripts, complete with MASSIVE SECURITY HOLE
b. Prohibit privileged scripts (like Linux does)
c. Substitute something like /proc/123/fd/3 for the script name
We can not just allow privileged scripts. (case "a")
I seem to recall option "c" being vetoed by the emperor penguin.
That leaves us with option "b". Privileged scripts are not allowed.

This does not matter. Look:
shell does exec() to start the script
kernel looks at script
kernel starts interpreter with privileges (capabilities, setuid, etc.)
user plays with links, substituting an evil script
interpreter opens the evil script
the evil script runs
the evil script can do _everything_ the original script could do

Of course, assuming the normal model is tolerable. Security systems
are totally useless if people disable them to get their work done.
("disable" often means "never installed", not "cracked")

I don't think you've quite got the idea of scripts yet. You might as
well just put the privileges (capabilities, setuid, etc.) on the
interpreter, because attackers can substitute any script they like.
