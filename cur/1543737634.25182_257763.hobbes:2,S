Hi Jeff,
Curiosity: Is this defined in any UNIX standard?
Adv. Programming in the UNIX environment says:
12.2 Nonblocking I/O
"Nonblocking I/O lets us issue an I/O operation, such as open, read,
or write and not have it block forever. If the operation cannot be 
completed, return is made immediately with an error noting that 
the operation would have blocked."
He is talking about read's on descriptors (pipe's, devices, etc) which 
block in case of no data present, not about filesystem IO.
But here we create our own semantics of O_NONBLOCK on read() of 
fs IO. As you say page_cache_readahead can block for one
trying to allocate pages, possibly while submitting IO too.
The patch is cool - might be nice to check if SuS or someone else
specificies behaviour and try to match if so?
