oh... you did... sorry.
I had deleted the original email, but just found it at
  
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0208.0/0802.html
and there are attachments.
The dmesg makes me feel very sure that you aren't using autodetect.
Please provide:
  fdisk -l /dev/sda
  fdisk -l /dev/sdb
  fdisk -l /dev/sdc
I don't understand why raidstart doesn't work.. Maybe you should show
me your /etc/raidtab as well.
