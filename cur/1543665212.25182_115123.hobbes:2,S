Didn't apply the patch cos I don't see that in the lspci output:

00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corp. 440BX/ZX - 82443BX/ZX AGP bridge (rev 03)
00:07.0 Bridge: Intel Corp. 82371AB PIIX4 ISA (rev 02)
00:07.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82371AB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01)

00:07.3 Bridge: Intel Corp. 82371AB PIIX4 ACPI (rev 03)
The rest are sound, cardbus etc.
