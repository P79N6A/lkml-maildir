I agree. Even with XML ugliness that's a fairly important area.

The other problem with the current kgdb code is that it has some serious
problems. e.g. it reinvents various kernel interfaces that already
exist -- one example is that it adds new notify_die()s just to reimplement
the standard __ex_table exceptions in a bogus way.
Couple of other issues. So even if it was a good idea to merge the
code is not really fully in merge shape anyways.
