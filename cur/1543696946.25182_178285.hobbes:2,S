Triple faults you can't debug, they raise a line outside the CPU, and 
normal PC hardware will cause that to just trigger a reboot.
But double faults do get caught, and that debugging stuff actually is in
the standard kernel. It won't give _nearly_ as good a debug report as a
"normal" oops, since I didn't want the double-fault handler to touch
anything even remotely unsafe, but it often gives a good hint about what
might be wrong. Certainly better than triple-faulting did (which we still
do for _catastrophic_ corruption, eg totally munged kernel page tables etc
- it's just very hard to avoid once you get corrupted enough).
