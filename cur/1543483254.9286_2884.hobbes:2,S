Subject: network loopback doesn't work in 2.2.1?

After booting 2.2.1, I found that, although the loopback interface was
up, no route was pointing to it, and "telnet 127.1" didn't connect but
eventually timed out.
eth0, though, was up, had a route and was working.
I then tried to add a route by hand:
route add -net 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo
netstat -r:
127.0.0.0    *               255.0.0.0   U         0 0          0 lo
yet I still couldn't connect to anything. ifconfig showed that lo did indeed
transmit and receive packets:
lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:3924  Metric:1
          RX packets:10 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:10 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
And my firewall rules also showed that the apckets were accepted:
   10  1060 ACCEPT     all  ------ 0xFF 0x00  *                              127.0.0.0/8           0.0.0.0/0             n/a
Booting into 2.1.132 and everything was working fine again (I'm now
running 2.1.132). BTW, I upgraded to net-tools-1.50 at the same time as
I upgraded to 2.2.1, so it might be some kind of synergy effect (But the
same net-tools work under 2.1.32). It also worked with 2.2.0.
Also, I minor note on Documentation/Changes, I can read there:

At least on my system there is no "rt_local" file anywhere in /proc.
HTH,
