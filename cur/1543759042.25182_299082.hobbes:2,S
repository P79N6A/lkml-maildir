This only attacks part of the problem.
Most regressions that annoy users aren't in some core system, they are 
in drivers.
What if $big_driver_update in 2.6.12 fixed a serious bug for some people 
but broke the driver for many other people, and both reverting this 
patch and fixing the driver for the people it's broken for exceeds such 
size limits?
