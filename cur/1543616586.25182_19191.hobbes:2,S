Hi all
After weeks of testing, knocking my head against all sorts of objects,
trying out other potential OSes etc. etc. ad. infinitum, I got the hint of
using the rmap patch to fix my problems with reading multiple large files
at once (see prevois thread with subject "[BUG] Error reading multiple
large files").
Will this problem be addressed in 2.4 or perhaps 2.[56] ?
My testing shows that the current vm can't handle high/non-standards load
efficiently. Isn't this something that clearly should be addressed?
