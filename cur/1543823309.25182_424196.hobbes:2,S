No, this is a function of the architecture code, not the specific
machine it is running on.
So if the architecture ensures alignment and no holes, then they don't
need the overhead of CONFIG_UNALIGNED_ZONE or CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE.
If they do not ensure correct alignment, then they must enable
CONFIG_UNALIGNED_ZONE, even if there may be actual systems which do
result in aligned zones.
