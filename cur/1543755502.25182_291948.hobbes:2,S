 Try to play with sound card's latency timer using setpci. For me,
that's the only way to silent unwanted pops on ens1370. It may work
with via, too.
 Magic command is: /sbin/setpci -v -s 01:09.0 latency_timer=40
You have to substitute 01:09.0 with your card's PCI location and play
around with latency_time value.
