The driver provides this:  /proc/v4l3/vid0/gamma.java
:-)
The very idea of a gamma table is featuritis. Just a single number
will do for most anyone. You get from 0.01 to 2.55 and "off" with
just 8 bits.
If you want to get fancy, I guess you need:
1 gamma value per primary
3 tri-stimulus values for each primary  ("What color is red?")
3 tri-stimulus values for the whitepoint (maybe)
1 black level for each primary
That is 18 values at most.
