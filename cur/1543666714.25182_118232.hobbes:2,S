When compiling NTFS support in 2.5.65 on a big-endian machine (m68k), I get:
| fs/ntfs/compress.c:167: warning: passing arg 1 of `__swab16p' from incompatible pointer type
| fs/ntfs/compress.c:207: warning: passing arg 1 of `__swab16p' from incompatible pointer type
| fs/ntfs/compress.c:228: warning: passing arg 1 of `__swab16p' from incompatible pointer type
| fs/ntfs/compress.c:333: warning: passing arg 1 of `__swab16p' from incompatible pointer type
The offending code does `le16_to_cpup(cb)', with cb a pointer to a u8.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
