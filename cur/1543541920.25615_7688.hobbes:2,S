I agree, killing init, kernel threads, etc, should be the -last- possible choice
of kills.  For some reason the OOM killer never seems to get the process that's
currently sucking in memory, it -always- gets the innocent guys and on X
machines invariably kills it thus rendering the machine unusable as the video
isn't recoverable.

Yes, it would be good.
