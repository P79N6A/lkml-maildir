I have done this.  The file is arch/x86_64/kernel/signal.c: if I compile
this with gcc 20070627 then everything works, if I compile it with gcc
20070707 then udevsettle hangs.  This is independent of the gcc version used
to compile the rest of the kernel.  (The dates refer to versions of the
Debian gcc-4.2 package and its dependencies.)
