Why?  What is the point in compiling bttv statically into the kernel?
Unlike filesystems/ide/scsi/... you don't need it to get the box up.
No problem to compile the driver as module and configure it with
/etc/modules.conf ...

Yes.  Some bt878 cards don't have a ID, and there are a few cases
where different cards have the same subsystem ID.
