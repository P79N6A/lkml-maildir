Subject: CONFIG_IDE_PROC_FS: /sys is not full replacement of /proc

May be I miss something obvious but most information that was available 
in /proc/ide is missing under /sys. At the very least, Mandriva hardware 
detection expects /proc/ide/hdX/model; nothing close is under /sys.
Are there any plans to extend IDE /sys interface to provide full range of 
information from /proc? Alternatively I appreciate description (or pointer to 
thereof) how to get information that was available under /proc/ide 
without /proc/ide :)
Thank you
