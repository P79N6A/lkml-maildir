I want this.  I've been thinking about it since your original post, and 
having just gone through a round of development involving massive amounts of 
kprint output (real time performance monitoring) I can say I'd prefer a more 
flexible way to do it, not to mention more efficient.  I'd like to have the 
option of leaving tracing code in some of my development projects all the 
time, just disabled until I say the magic word, then have it routed to a 
device as you describe.  Presumably you intend to use a ring buffer as printk 
does, simplified by the fact that you don't have to parse "level" information 
out of the string.  This will all be a lot more useful if it works from 
interrupts etc.
Perhaps you should also think about a non-devfs way of doing this, I don't 
know, it's a matter of taste.  Here's a Rube Goldbergesque way: when the 
client registers, export a dynamically allocated major number through proc 
and let the user mknod a device with that major.
Please cc me when you have something to try.
