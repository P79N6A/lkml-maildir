It certainly is dangerous. I guess we should turn off FUA for the time 
being. Barrier auto-fallback was once implemented but it didn't seem 
like a good idea as it was too complex and hides low level bug from 
higher level. The concensus seems to be developing blacklist of drives 
which lie about FUA support (currently only one drive). Official kernel 
doesn't seem to be the correct place to grow the blacklist, Maybe we 
should do it from -mm?

All sii controllers and piix/ahci seem to handle FUA pretty ok. And 
yeah, we may have to create controller blacklist too.
BTW, can you let me know what drive we're talking about now (model name 
and firmware revision)?
