I could be wrong here but this is a direct analog of devfs as far as I
can see. 'device' (note the quotes. I'm not being that exact here :)
names are just arbitary descriptors much like syscall numbers. What they
are is what got decided on. According to the above that's not policy.
Now access to what they represent would be and AFAIK this is handled
by devfsd (or it can be - not too sure of of its present state). It'll
set the permissions of the files and as such that's all in user space.
whee..
(here's hoping that everyone didn't say that in the 2-300 msgs above ;)
