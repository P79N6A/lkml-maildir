This describes the problem more accurately.  However, I didn't notice any
outbound frag-needed icmps.  That was several kernels ago and we had since
simply put up with it.

Doing the above works.  We are ecstatic.
Being naive that I am and not getting feedback *hint* *hint :), why did
setting -all- interfaces on the net devs to an MTU of 576 still fail but
setting the mss on the route work?
Now if only dhcp supported that in the options :S
