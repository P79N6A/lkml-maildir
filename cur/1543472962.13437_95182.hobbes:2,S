OK, I was told that the intr (or soft) option helps. Yes, it does. Thanks
for poiting this out.

Postings indicated that recent work on the NFS client/server helped both
problems. (At least my impression that it's being worked on was correct.)
I will upgrade to 2.1.132-acX (or whatever) and try.

(Another question is whether NFS is the best networking fs.)
Thanks for all your suggestions!

 There is  something  frustrating  about  the quality  and  speed  of  Linux
 development.  I.e. the quality  is too high  and the speed  is too high, in
 other words,  I  can implement  this XXXX feature,  but I bet  someone else
 has already done it and is just about to release his patch to Linus soon...
    [From a posting of Tigran Aivazian to linux-kernel, XXXX = disk stat]
