Hi All
I want to know which are the evnets
that can lead to the calling of alloc_skb
function which is used to allocate sk_buff.
Arrival and departure of packet are 2 events
which I know. Are there any other events/cases
which can lead to alloc_skb(...) function call in kernel.
Thanks for help
Sushant
