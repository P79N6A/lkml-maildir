Actually I was leaning towards non-overcommit as an approach if you're
that worried (I know user non-overcommit is not a perfect solution). I
like Andrea's patch but this is one of these circular issues that'll
keep popping up from time to time because there isn't a perfect
solution that works for everyone all of the time. I typically find oom
results in things I want dying underneath me. Windows does something
with extending its paging file when this happens - has anyone looked
at weird alternatives such as this for desktop Linux?

Yes ok. I was picking at the OOM Killer rather than at you - you just
didn't get my sense of humour but that's ok.
Jon.
