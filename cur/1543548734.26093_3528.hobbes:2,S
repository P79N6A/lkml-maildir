Okay who can teach me how to force hooks and ram this down the PPC
pci_write_config_word(dev, PCI_COMMAND, 0x05);
I have all the address registered.
My new PPC G3 (7600/132) toy is not allowing IO's on PCI cards to come
alive.  Thus I get some of the most beuatiful lockups ever.
I suspect that this needs to be handled down in the arch.
./linux/arch/ppc/kernel/{chrp_pci.c|mbx_pci.c|pmac_pci.c|prep_pci.c}
Basically I can not get the IO's active, regardless of BIOS on the card.
Yes this is the old trick that used to work of making ix86 cards run in
non ix86-pci slots.
Here is the fun part, I have a native mac/ppc Ultra-66 card that is fin
under Mac OS, but the IO's are not enable in linux and it crash like a big
dog also.
Cheers,
