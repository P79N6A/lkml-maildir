I put "install docbook stylesheets" into google and found:
* Norm Walsh's stylesheets for DocBook
* SGML DocBook Stylesheets
* docbook-stylesheets-doc
* docbook-dsssl-stylesheets
* DocBook XSLT stylesheets
Please tell me which of them should I install to get Linux Kernel
docs compiled.

On 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook
 there are:
docbook-dsssl
docbook-dsssl-doc
docbook-testdocs
docbook-xsl
jrefenty
litprog
slides
slides-demo
website
xslt-include-import-test
I can't see neither "docbook" nor "stylesheets". Please tell me which of
them should I use to install "DocBook stylesheets" or "docbook".

When I install gcc, I don't use any distribution-packaged whatever.
I just:
* download source tarball from GCC homepage
* ./configure
* make
* make install
Have done it already at least twenty times with various versions of gcc and
never needed anything packaged by any distribution.
