This patch would seem to have its own problems, though. See:
	#define secs_to_cputime(__secs)           (msecs_to_jiffies(__secs * HZ))
which means that since there is no overflow checking (not in the current 
tree, and not in the fixed one that uses proper parenthesis and *1000, you 
can easily end up overflowing in the *1000 case, and causing nasty things.
So would it not be nicer to just keep everything in seconds instead? 
Alternatively, seriously fix "secs_to_cputime()" to do the proper thing?
Or did I miss a patch and you already did that?
