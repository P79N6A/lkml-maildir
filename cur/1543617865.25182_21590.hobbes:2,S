That may be, but there's all the page table manipulation code that goes
along with it as well.  Yes, a similar thing could be done with that,
it needs someone with the time to look into it and cook up a patch.
(I've got my hands full, so I'm not eager to pick this up right now).

Well, I've got a BUG() in there that'll trigger when pci_alloc_consistent()
is called from IRQ, and so far no one has reported an incidence of
that occuring, despite there being USB OHCI controllers available on ARM.
Maybe no one is pushing USB hard enough on ARM to cause these allocations,
I don't know.
