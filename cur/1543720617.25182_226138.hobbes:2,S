Better to add the declaration into a header like linux/ide.h that is
included into both ide.c and ide-pnp.c so that when/if pnpide_init()
ever changes its prototype you will get a warning during compilation.
The only good reason to have declarations within .c files is for forward
declarations of functions only used in the same file.
Cheers, Andreas
