yes, I was referring only about his long term design arguments.

in theory those pages should be reserved, so it would be the same like
the pages in the mempool, but while they do nothing they could hold some
cache data, but for example they couldn't be either mapped in any
address space etc... at least unless we're able to atomically unmap
pages and flush tlb in all cpus etc.. :) it would be a mess and it's not
a concidence that Ben's first implementation wasn't taking adantage of
it and that in 3-4 years it's still not there yet :). Plus as you
mentioned it would add the local_save_irq overhead to the common path as
well, to be able to do things from irqs (which I didn't considered in
the previous email). That would hurt performance.

yes, and as said it's a problem that doesn't affect performance or
scalability, nor it wastes a _percentage_ of ram, it only wastes a
_fixed_ amount of ram.

100% agreed (as said above too :).
