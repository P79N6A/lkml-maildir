someone (randy appleton?) is already looking at adding madvise().  i hope
the work i'm doing doesn't make his work more difficult to implement.
FreeBSD has madvise() and adjusts its read-around depending on the
application's suggested access pattern.  it doesn't appear that it has any
sophisticated guessing heuristics about whether an application is
accessing in sequential or random order.
interestingly, though, it appears that FreeBSD's read() simply does
clustered reads rather than any complicated read-ahead.  but i could be
wrong about that.
