I twisted my brain, why the watchdog thread might change the problem and
I think I have a rough idea of the scenario. 
Can you apply the following patch, which prints out the CPU on which the
kernel messages are generated and upload the screenshot when the hang
happens ? Oh, please enable CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME or add "time" to the
kernel commandline.
