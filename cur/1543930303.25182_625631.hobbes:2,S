I tried running powertop, it complains about not having timer 
statistics, I looked throughout the kernel config for a timer stat 
option, but can't find one.
I didn't have hpet compiled in, i'm not sure if this is required but a 
lot of places seem to suggest hpet and high precision timer and tickless 
be compiled together.  I also disabled cpuidle and i'll reboot and try 
that.
