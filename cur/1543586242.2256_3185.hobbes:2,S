What does /proc/slabinfo say? The most likely leak is a dentry leak or
an inode leak, and both of those should be fairly easy to see in the
slab info (dentry_cache and inode_cache respectively).
Obviously, it could be a data page leak too, but such a leak should be
easy to see by creating a few big files and deleting them..
