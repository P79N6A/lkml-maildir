why does it have to be pinned? The page is mostly private to this thread 
until it manages to flip it into the pte. Since there's no pte presence, 
there's no swapout possible [here i'm assuming anonymous malloc() 
memory, which is the main focus of Arjan's patch]. Any parallel 
unmapping of that page will be caught and the installation of the page 
will be prevented by the 'bit-spin-lock' embedded in the pte.

but the page wont be found by any other CPU, so it wont be freed! It is 
private to this CPU. The page has no pte presence. It will only be 
present and lookupable as a result of the cmpxchg() flipping the page 
into the pte.
