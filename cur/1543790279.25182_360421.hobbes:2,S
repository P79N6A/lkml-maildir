Ingo,
So what's the fix here?  The PIT is used for jiffies and the NMI lockup
uses the apic timer to test against.  So if there isn't a ktimer that
goes off for 5 seconds (usually on slower machines), you get a false
positive for a lockup.  Is this really a bug that the apic doesn't go
off for 5 seconds?
So, do we move the NMI detect back to the PIT, or use a more generic
solution that I supplied?  I actually prefer my generic solution because
1. we don't need to worry about which timers we are using at the moment.
2. Like you said, it can be used later on with things like dynamic
ticks, or tickless solutions.
