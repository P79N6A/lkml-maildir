You might want to float this idea by Eric Raymond.  It's POSSIBLE (distant 
but possible) that the new CML2 stuff might make this sort of thing easier to 
automate.
Correction, it's possible CML2 might make this POSSIBLE to automate.  It 
sounds like it would still be a female dog and a half to implement.  But I'm 
not the one to ask...
