That requires to dynamically allocate and initialize kthread if you
can have potentially multiple threads (= too much to write) 
I think it would be better to pass data as a separate argument.
You can put the kthread and the data into a private structure on
the stack, pass the address of it to kernel_thread and wait until the 
thread has read it using a completion. 
That would make a nicer API.
