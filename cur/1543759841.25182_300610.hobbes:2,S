Hi all,
Can someone please tell me where can I find and which random/pseudo-random number generator can I use inside the linux kernel? (2.4.28)
I found out 1 function get_random_bytes() in linux/drivers/char/random.c but thats not what I want.
I want a function where I will be supplying a seed to that function as an input, and will get a random number back. If same seed is used, same number should be generated again.
Can anybody please help me with that?
Thanks and regards,
Vineet.
