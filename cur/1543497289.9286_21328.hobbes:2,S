Not exactly, but often.  It complicates things like error recovery
enormously, and it rapidly becomes useless as soon as you have devices
on multiple buses (although SANs such fibrechannel fabrics do help
there).  As long as you have spare bus bandwidth, doing zero-copy
transfer through the OS is as fast, and it is much cleaner.
