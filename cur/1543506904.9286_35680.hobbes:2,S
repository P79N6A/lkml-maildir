Is it possible to install linux on a PC without a graphics card and
monitor via the serial cable, like it's possible on SparcStations?
More specifically I'm trying to install RedHat 6.0.
The machine I'm installing on has serial ports and a network connection.
All I need is a way to see what would be on the screen to use the
installation program.
