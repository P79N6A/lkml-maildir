Huh, not an hour after I said I hadn't heard anything I get two patches
and an explanation of what the base problem is, so I can apply it to any
other similar problems. I assumed that no one else was using this old
stuff.
Note: I have an old tulip card with a BNC and 10baseT connector on a
single card. I had assumed one or the other, but with 2.5 kernels the card
appears as two NICs, with separate io and irq addresses. Since I have to
support thinnet or replace a bunch of devices with network built in, and
cards which support BNC are getting scarce, this looks like a nice
semi-firewall solution.
