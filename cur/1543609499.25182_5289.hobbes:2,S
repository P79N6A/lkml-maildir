He's talking about asm-i386/io.h.
__ISA_IO_base (what's in a name, why not call it __ISA_MEM_base?!?!?) is the
kernel virtual address of the start of ISA _memory_ space. On ia32 PCs, ISA
memory space overlaps with the first 16 MB of real RAM, at CPU physical address
0.
(DISCLAIMER: my ia32 knowledge is limited)

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
