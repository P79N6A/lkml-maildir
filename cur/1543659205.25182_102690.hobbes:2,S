Yes, exactly. Lazyness is good. Any second spend on hitting Ctrl+F
and typing in the name of a cleanup function is lost. Any time
you overlook something because the cleanup and the code are
not on the same screen is a bug that is overlooked.
Any time one of the cleanup functions is overlooked can cause
hours lost in debugging after a change.
