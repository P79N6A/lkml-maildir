I've tried using setterm...it doesn't take (permanently anyway). In
FreeBSD, you can set teh default colors in the syscons.c (defaults are
FG_LIGHTGREY || BG_BLACK....I set them to FG_WHITE || BG BLACK) file and
recompile the kernel, so that all programs use those colors by
default. I'm assuming that this is set somewhere in the console driver
code in linux, but I have thus far been unsuccessful in finding where.

:(Is that otherwise in FreeBSD? I can hardly imagine.)
