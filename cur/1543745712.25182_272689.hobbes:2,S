Hi Andrew,
I haven't tested it yet on any of my machines (due to the hang). 
I am about to give it a try. But my understanding (please update 
me if I am wrong) is,
1) DISCONTIG_MEM support is not working yet - so i can't use any
of my NUMA boxes.
2) AMD64 is not supported - i can't use my Opteron machine.
3) ppc is not supported - i can't use Power3 and Power4 machines.
So, I can only try it on non-NUMA i386 smp boxes. I have few of
those to try. I will give an update next week on my testing.
Thanks,
Badari
