setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, ...) can be used to limit the amount
of virtual memory an application uses, but the corresponding
call to limit physical memory, setrlimit(RLIMIT_RSS, ...),
is not implemented in the main tree.
Rik has implemented this feature several times in the past...
here's his 2.4.0 patch,
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=97811999316400&w=2
and his 2.5.27 patch
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102719516200414&w=2
I need this feature on my embedded system, which uses 2.4.17 or so.
Is the 2.4.0 patch the best place to start, or has anyone
updated that patch for a more recent 2.4?
Thanks,
Dan
