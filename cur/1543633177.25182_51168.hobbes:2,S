Doesn't this still have a problem if you touch data in the same cache
line as the DMA buffer after the pci_map but before the DMA takes
place?  The CPU will pull the cache line back in and it might not see
the data the DMA brought in.
It seems to me that to be totally safe, pci_unmap would have to save
the non-aligned part outside the buffer to temporary storage, do an
invalidate, and then copy back the non-aligned part.
In any case if this is what pci_map is supposed to do then we have to
fix up several architectures at least...
Thanks,
