It _is_ important.  Not because kernel developers do care about it,  
but because it's important for reasons of its own and therefore they  
should.  Networking timeouts and highres audio timers are two _VERY_  
different applications of "do this thing then", and kernel developers  
should be made aware of them.  If you disagree, please explain in  
detail exactly why you think the lifetime is unimportant.  I have yet  
to see an email regarding this, and I've searched the archives pretty  
carefully, in addition to watching this thread.
Cheers,
