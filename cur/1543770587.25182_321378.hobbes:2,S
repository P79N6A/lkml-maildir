Hi Karel,
Sorry for the delay.

I don't think there is a driver for that. A driver isn't the only
solution to do that though.

The eeprom driver supports the 24C01, 24C02, 24C04, 24C08 and 24C16. In
other words, all models which can be read using SMBus read byte data
commands.

Exactly.

Some have, but that's unrelated.

You may want to look at the prog/eepromer directory of the lm_sensors
project. We have a set of user-space tools to write to EEPROMs of
various sizes. They rely on the i2c-dev driver as the user-space/kernel
interface.
