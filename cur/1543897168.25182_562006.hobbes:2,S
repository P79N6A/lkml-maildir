We have the __ASSEMBLY__ define for this, so just for asm code we don't 
need a separate header.

What's the point in splitting these two?
After this patch <linux/elf.h> seems to be pretty much empty, I'd rather 
suggest to move the function declarations to elfcore.h and leave the basic 
elf definitions in elf.h. Many small header files have the disadvantage 
that it takes longer to find the needed information.
bye, Roman
