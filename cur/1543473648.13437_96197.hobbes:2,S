Linus, 
wouldn't it be better to do something like
   config_486_alignment        (does the "rediculous alingments" for '486)
   config_assume_working_tsc   (you call that pentium+)
   config_assume_working_apic  (pentium pro)
That way if you turn on "assume working tsc" you'll get a kernel
that does that assumption, possibly augmented with:
   panic ("Your machine doesn't have a working tsc, "
          "but this kernel was built with that assumption");
(just like for the math coprocessor stuff.) 
Of these options, the first is an performance issue: 486s will run
faster, others will not notice/ perform slightly worse.  The others
statically compile assumptions into the kernel, which if not true
prevents the kernel from running.....
Why change it now? Well, this way we can expand towards the future
where every different processor has specific features. That way we
lose the intel-names that may or may not apply to intel-competitors.
