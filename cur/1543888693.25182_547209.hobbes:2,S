Well this indicates that something destroys the sysfs pointer structure 
that SLUB is using. Could you reenable CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG and boot with the 
option "slub_debug" on the kernel command line?
Also enable the list debug options in kernel hacking.
This should show up on the console since the failure is in slub_sysfs_init 
which is long after the console has been enabled. I wonder why it did not 
show so far?

Hmmmm..... We have seen this before
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=117891943401284&w=2
I suspect this is due to an interaction with other debug flags you have 
set. What I see in your .config is
CONFIG_DEBUG_RT_MUTEXES=y
Try to switch this off if switching off the lockdep flags does not hel.
CONFIG_DEBUG_PI_LIST=y
Will go off with the above
# CONFIG_RT_MUTEX_TESTER is not set
Leave off
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES=y
Try toggling if the disabling lockdep flags does not work.
CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y
CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y
CONFIG_LOCKDEP=y
I suspect the above are the main candidates for trouble. Could you
switch those off?
# CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCKDEP is not set
CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y
# CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCKING_API_SELFTESTS is not set
CONFIG_STACKTRACE=y
# CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT is not set
Debug kobject may be helpful.
CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=y
