But if they are not constant, then you do, and my current area of
interest (
http://www.op.net/~pbd/quasimodo/
) doesn't feature such
objects. there's an RT-FIFO "DSP" like thread running (and perhaps
bound) to one processor, and another bunch of threads playing with its
parameters and injecting work requests into its queue. this *isn't*
going to be lockfree.
As I said, I need to think through more carefully whether or not
sigsuspend() and the current schedule() semantics stand any hope of
working correctly for the general case (of a multithreaded, variable
workload, pipelined application).
