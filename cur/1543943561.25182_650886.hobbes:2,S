The problem is current behaviour is already broken as it applies the quirk 
*unconditionally* for all Nvidia hardwarde where no hpet is detected. The 
latter is just heuristics. *If* correct Nforce2 ID gets added to the proposed 
patch, behaviour would be equivalent to current situation for me (nforce2, 
mcp51). Still I am saying mcp51 doesn't belong per-se to the list of chipsets 
which need to be quirked, as for me it shows adverse effect. Taking mcp51 out 
would be an advancement.
If there are situations where quirking is correct and other situation where it 
is incorrect for the same type of chipsets, I think then the quirk should not 
be applied automatically.
So I suggest something like this as a start. The quirk only gets applied for 
nforce2 unconditionally, as it was intended originally. For chipsets between 
nforce3 and before nforce5 the user gets a message and no quirk gets applied 
automatically. If there are known bug reports (Andi Kleen didn't supply any 
references) some more infos could be asked from the reportes. Then for known 
broken bios versions the quirk could be applied by DMI scan *selectively*. 
(This part of code is missing here.) I also don't know whether the list of 
IDs is complete.
Warning I hand edited the original proposed patch, so it won't apply and 
probably won't compile. But I hope one gets the idea.
