Any of those available in the kernel. Where's the problem?

A swap device is doubtlessly easier. But isn't the problem of using
a swap file already fixed? The writeout seems the easiest part of

Then use a "fake reboot" option and save the image to a ramdisk.
It isn't that hard. You must be able to survive that, as io errors during
write out are possible.
