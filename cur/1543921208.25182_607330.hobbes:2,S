There was a commit ab9c232286c2b77be78441c2d8396500b045777e regarding libata 
on linus's master tree that happened on Friday, that was pulled into kvm git 
over the weekend.. I dont know if that may be affecting you.. there is/was 
also chatter on LKML regarding some problems with s/g, you may want to check 
there.
Cheers
Mike
