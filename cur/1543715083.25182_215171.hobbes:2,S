 I'm glad to read this.

 Well, the bug has been introduced by IBM in their firmware (SMM code).  
;-)  The patch only works it around.  Functionally the changed code is the
same for your configuration.
 If you are asking about the problematic code, then it's there since
2.3.x, so it's in 2.4, too.  It's a part of the NMI watchdog support,
though it's used for ordinary timer interrupts for certain systems as
well.

 Apparently there are problems with the workaround on certain AMD
Athlon-based systems.  I suppose they need to be resolved somehow first.

 Ask IBM.  The reason is an incorrect handling of PIC (8259A) state
saving/restoration.
