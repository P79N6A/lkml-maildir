Subject: 2.4.10pre12: IO_APIC_init_uniprocessor undefined

Compiling without SMP but with "APIC and IO-APIC support on
uniprocessors" enabled, i.e.
# CONFIG_SMP is not set
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
fails with IO_APIC_init_uniprocessor undefined. This comes from
init/main.c line 486, which has the only mention of this routine 
in the kernel source - it seems pre12 removed this routine from
kernel/io_apic.c. So is this just a forgotten remnant of that
clean-up, or should there have been a replacement in the patch?
