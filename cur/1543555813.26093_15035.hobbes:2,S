I have a big problem with Redhat.  They make incompatible changes to
utilities, do not feed patches back to maintainers then expect the rest
of the world to follow their lead.  The -i and -m flags to modutils are
not the only example, I recently found IA64 and Sparc patches they had
added to modutils code and not bothered to tell me.  Other distributors
are much better about sending me patches, Debian and SuSe in particular
do the right thing.
Since "-F System.map" in modutils is equivalent to "-m System.map -i"
and works on all distributions, not just Redhat, the "-m -i" patch is
unnecessary.  Consider this my protest against bad habits by
distributors, they created the mess with their lack of communication
and they have to fix it.
