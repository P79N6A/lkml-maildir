Hi
Sorry - lost the topic of the email.
Anyways, i am currently running the 5328 version of the NVidia drivers 
(pre-patched).
Thank you all for your patience and help. 
How was it resolved? I formated and started from scratch. Not elegant, but it 
worked. Dunno what the real problem was, but it's over and my card is 
working ... Hurrah ...

with kind regards,
