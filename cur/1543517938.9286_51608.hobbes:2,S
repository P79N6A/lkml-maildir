Yes, and I have proposed similar solutions many times before.

Exactly.

Yes.

Wrong. You will only get a performance hit *if* there has been a 
change to the internal kernel API's that necessitate a compatibility 
layer to be implemented so the old drivers can still be used. This 
doesn't mean that a performance hit is necessary for all drivers. 
When a new kernel is released where the API's have changed, the 
drivers should be changed to eliminate the performance overheads by 
updating them to use the newer, faster interfaces.
And the kernel API's don't get frozen because of this. If you change 
the kernel API's, you just need to extend the exported device driver 
API to include the new kernel level API's so that newer drivers can 
take advantage of this for maximum performance.
This is what developed OS'es in the real world is all about. Every 
commercial OS on the planet does things this way because that is the 
only way to guarantee reliability down the track. Alan can complain 
about the stability of Windows 9x being attributed to binary drivers, 
but the same argument does not hold true for Windows NT, OS/2, 
Solaris, Netware, QNX, BeOS, MacOS or any other commercial OS. Fact 
is they all use binary device drivers, and many of them are a lot 
more stable than Linux is.

Garbage. It takes finite amounts of time to re-implement existing 
device drivers using a new kernel level API. No-one in the right mind 
is going to arbitrarily change this at will. Doing so will then break 
compatibility with all the existing device drivers that have been 
developed, requiring all the device drivers to be re-worked to 
support the new interface. As soon as you do that, you have to retest 
*evert* single device again to ensure it is working properly and you 
have not introduced new bugs.
Hence before Alan or Linus or anyone else seriously considers 
changing critical kernel level API's, consideration must be paid to 
ensure compatibility with the existing sources. Doing so could push 
back the release of a new Linux kernel revision by months to iron out 
the potential bugs that introduced into all the existing device 
drivers.
> I know which I'd prefer.
Put it this way. I would rather have the latest wiz bang internal 
kernel interface get developed with a compatibility layer so existing 
drivers can actually work (with a performance hit), rather than 
having to wait for months before I can use it at all because the 
kernel drivers for my devices have not yet been updated to support 
the new interfaces. Or worse that someone considering themselves to 
be superman hacks the existing drivers so they will compile with the 
new interfaces without actually being able to test all the drivers.
