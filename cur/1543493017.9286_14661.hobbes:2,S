Maybe I'm wrong, but the impression I've gotten from you, David, is
that whenever a new person pops up into this debate and disagrees with
you, you tell them they're ignorant (not reading beforehand, not
thinking, etc.).
Like I said, maybe I'm wrong, and maybe it's just my perception, but
even so, you might want to run a self diagnostic and see why you are
giving that impression.

I've not responded for days because I've been busy, not because I feel
your argument "blows away" the suid-root scheme.
You want privileged inheritable bits, fine. You can do that with
suid-root or with sticky+immutable. After all, the inheritable bits in
both cases are stored in the CAP ELF header. So to solve the security
problem, you drop privs on exec if they're not in the inheritable
mask. And you don't allow lusers to modify the inheritable mask.
IIRC, Pavel was suggesting lusers can modify the inheritable mask. I'm
not supporting that.
Where I think you are concerned with the suid-root scheme is that it
implies /bin/sh must be suid-root if you want it to inherit the caps
of a calling god process. I don't see a problem with that. Whether
you have a suid-root or a sticky+immutable magic flag, either way,
/bin/sh *is* special.
Now, I think that you think that a suid-root /bin/sh implies that
when you run a non-caps kernel, a random luser then does /bin/sh and
boom! Crack, crack, crack.
Well, this isn't the case. If you read one of my earlier messages, I
suggested putting the suid-root+CAP ELF header stuff into user
space. So that means when you run the setcap programme, you either
edit the binary (if it's statically linked) to insert some magic code,
or ensure the dynamic linker has the magic code.
This magic code does all the work of raising caps if euid=0, if the
kernel has caps, and then sets euid to the stored euid in the
header. On the other hand, if the kernel doesn't have caps, the magic
code can elect to refuse to run the binary, or to set euid=uid, or
whatever.
This means you can safely switch between a caps-enabled and a non-caps
kernel. You can elect, on a per-binary basis, what should happen when
running a privileged binary on a non-caps kernel. This gives
incredible flexibilty, allowing a sysadmin to configure the level of
paranoia they wish.
This scheme also has the advantage of running over NFS, CODA, ISO9660,
AFS and so on. You can run a special auditing programme at boot time
if you want to check the integrity of the dynamic linker, for extra
paranoia.
And best of all: it's all in user space!

Those suid-root binaries will be quite safe, because of the magic code
that gets run before main().
