I'm having a similar problem...  Do you have the kernel compiled with SMP on?
I've seen some references to bugs in the SMP related code that is apparently
not a problem with a non-SMP kernel.
I do and I'm going to test it without SMP.  One of my boxes IS SMP but most
are not.
It seems to be related to the SCSI driver since it crashes or panics when
there is heavy disk activity and log messages or the occasional console
messages indicate IO related interrupt problems.  (Aeiiii, etc., very large
stack traces, or just a cold black screen completely dead.)
