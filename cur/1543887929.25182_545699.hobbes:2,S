Hi Alan, Erik and Hirofumi and the rest,
I want to inform you of my success. So first of all thanks for your help! 
Assuring, that the buffer is aligned according 4k (pagesize = getpagesize() 
and multiple of sectorsize = blockdev --getss) using memalign or 
posix_memalign, did the job. Thanks a lot. A very nice feature.
The compiler option -D_GNU_SOURCE helped also to avoid including asm-header of 
fcntl.h.
bye
Hubi
