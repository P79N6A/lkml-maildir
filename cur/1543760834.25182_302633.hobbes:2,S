This should be fixed since 2.6.10.

HFS+ metadata is also in the page cache, so as long as everything is 
cached, HFS+ won't notice a problem.

Currently nobody tells fs about such events, so even if I check for 
write errors, it can still take a while until the error is detected.
I acknowledge that this is a problem, but I don't think it's a HFS+ 
specific problem, there is currently no standard procedure for fs what to 
do in such situations, so I didn't implement anything.
It would be nice if the fs would be tould about plug/unplug events, e.g. 
HFS+ could check the mount count to see if it was connected to a different 
host in the meantime and react appropriately.

This actually might be a real HFS+ problem :), I have to look into it.
