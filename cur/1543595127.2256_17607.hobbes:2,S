Who is maintaining the /dev/nvram driver?  I have a couple things I want to
suggest/ask.  
Currently it tracks O_EXCL on open() and sets a flag, whereby no other
open() calls can succeed.  Is this functionality really needed?  Perhaps it
should just be a reader/writer model : n readers or 1 writer.  In that
case, should open() block on a writer, or return -EBUSY?
nvram_release() calls lock_kernel() - any particular reason?
various other bits (nvram_open_cnt, for example) are not SMP safe.  I'm
making sure it is safe now.
What I really want to know is: should I bother making nvram_open_cnt SMP
safe, or should it just go away all together.  I vote for the latter
option, unless something depends on this behavior (in which case, other
fixes are needed, because it is broken :).
comments?
