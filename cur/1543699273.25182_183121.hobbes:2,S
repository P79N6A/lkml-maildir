Without commenting on the "right thing to do", I can only witness, that
the patch from Matthew does remove the Oops (or at least I couldn't
reproduce it any more).
Also, Russell, as you are maintaining PCMCIA code as well, I might just
remind, that the i82365 driver doesn't have the release method, which
produces a nice kernel-message with a backtrace on unloading of the
module. Or does that driver have a separate maintainer?
Thanks
