Consider this.  We're currently experimenting with a
transition from 8k to 4k stacks on x86, and that is
considered a very good thing.  Allocating a single-
page stack is easy, two (contigous) pages might fail.
So a bigger kernel stack is out.
As for rewriting code so it doesn't use stack - it
_is_ easy, but it might be a lot of _work_.
The simple approach is to replace all (big) stack
allocations with an explicit stack structure that you manages
on the heap. There'll be more code, but it won't be slower
because all the extra code is stuff that happen automatically
with the hw stack. (I.e. stuff the compiler normally take
care of.)
There is some more work if your interpreter also does deep recursion.
It involves making one big function of those that do the recursion
and manage the "calls" yourself with an array and a switch statement.
Again, not particularly hard, but it could take some time to implement.
