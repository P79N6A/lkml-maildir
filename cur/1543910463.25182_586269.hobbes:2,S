Subject: MTD_WRITE called by a kernel timer OK in 2.4.20?

Hi,
	I'm trying to periodically write to flash on a small embedded device I'm 
playing with. I want to sync a buffer to flash every 15 seconds if it's 
dirty. I'm using a 2.4.20 kernel(not my choice) and have connected my 
buffer_write routine to a kernel timer both directly and also via a tasklet 
initiated by a kernel timer. Both methods give me an oops when attempting to 
write the flash. Is there anything basically wrong with this method? Will 
MTD_WRITE not function in interrupt context? It works just fine when called 
from an ioctl.
Hope you can help
Andrew
