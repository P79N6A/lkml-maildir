This is somewhat a kernel issue...
I have this problem with 2.1.x & 2.2.x kernel series:
I have a Digiboard - serial line multiplexer. This is how it is detected
by 2.0.36 and 2.2.1 but the difference no THE PROBLEM is that in 2.0.36
my standard serial connector work but with 2.1.x and 2.2.x doesn't ! :(
--- dmesg sect. 2.0.36 ---
Serial driver version 4.13 with no serial options enabled
tty00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
tty01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
Digiboard PC/X{i,e,eve} driver v1.5.7
PC/Xx: PC/Xe (64k) I/O=0x200 Mem=0xd0000 Ports=16
--- dmesg sect. 2.2.1 ---
Serial driver version 4.27 with HUB-6 MANY_PORTS MULTIPORT SHARE_IRQ DETECT_IRQ enabled
ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 0) is a 16550A
DIGI epca driver version 1.1.0 loaded.
AND the modems connected on the Digiboard do work great in 2.0.36 but the
don't work at all in 2.1.x & 2.2.x

I NEED HELP BADLY ! Thank you for any help! I really want to move over to
