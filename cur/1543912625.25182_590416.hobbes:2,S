if you export weak symbols in your own module AND you have some
piece of kernel that will start using the symbol (which means the
kernel already needs to know about it) AND you don't know what you're
doing you get shot in the foot... BFD
maybe if you have such a case you should publish the source code of
that case so that we can suggest alternative approaches of what you're
trying to do..
