I don't doubt that there are some rare systems with very large
capacity flash chips.  However the size of all BIOS chips are measured
in bits.  Anyone talking about the capacity of BIOS chips in bytes
and not bits always raises a red flag with me because that is a very
common mistake.
I would be very surprised if the high volume commodity boards have
exceeded 8 megabits.
