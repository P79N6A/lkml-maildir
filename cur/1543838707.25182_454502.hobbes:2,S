It looks invalid, but its not, once again.  To understand why this
isn't a problem requires looking at the xfs_alloc_ag_vextent_small
call sites (there's only two).  If (*flen==0) is passed back out,
then the value in *fbno is discarded, always.

Nothing.  But its not a problem in practice.  However, that final
else branch is very much unlikely, so theres no real cost to just
initialising the local fbno to NULLAGBLOCK in that branch, and we
future proof ourselves a bit that way I guess (in case the callers
ever change - pretty unlikely, but we may as well).  How does the
patch below look to you?
cheers.
