You really need a CPUID hook.  The instruction is non-virtualizable, and 
anything claiming to be a hypervisor really has to support masking and 
flattening the cpuid namespace for the instruction itself.  It is used 
in assembler code and very early in boot.  The alternative is injecting 
a bunch of Xen-specific code to filter feature bits into the i386 layer, 
which is both bad for Linux and bad for Xen - and was quite ugly in the 
last set of Xen patches.
