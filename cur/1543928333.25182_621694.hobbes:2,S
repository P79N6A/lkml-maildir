Yes, it's in my queue still.  Kay and Alan want the patch as it fixes
the new /sys/block -> /sys/class/block patches.  When I add that one
back to my tree (Kay has debugged your old G5 problem now), I'll either
add this patch too, or figure out why it should not be needed.
For now, I'd recommend dropping it from your tree Andrew, as it might
cause odd issues on device removal (not quite sure though...)
thanks,
