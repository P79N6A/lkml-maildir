	Well... A bit of background...
	The Wavelan hardware has been obsoleted for the last 5
years. I put the driver in minimal maintainance mode, because I
already have a lot on my place (you would not want me to spend less
time on the IrDA stack, the Orinoco driver or the new Wireless
Extensions ?).
	The point is that the driver didn't work. I didn't look any
further and I decided for better or worse to use the version that is
in the Pcmcia package that has been working for more than one
year. Now that the two version are in sync, I can work from there.
	I tried to make sure to not loose any changes. Of course, I'm
only human.
	I hope that explains the situation.
	Attached you will find a patch that address some of your
concerns. This patch will apply to both the kernel version AND the
Pcmcia package version.
	Note also that it applies to the kernel *after* driver move
(that is pending - because I've put this patch at the end of my patch
queue).

	That's only personal preference. And the wrapper in theory
would allow to simply change the locking strategy if needed (like
disabling irq on the hardware instead of in software).

	For such an obsolete driver, it's not worth replacing code
that is working fine and has been debugged and tested for
years. Moreover, on most case the wait is really small.

	If you want to spend time on this, please send me a patch and
I'll apply it to both the kernel version and the Pcmcia package.

	I would not bother.
	By the way, I looked at the __FUNCTION__ business, and IrDA
will need a massive cleanup. *sight*...

	I didn't knew about that, and my gcc doesn't give any
warning. I can't believe that gcc is too stupid to realise that you
can't have trigraph within a string or a comment.
	Done. And guess what, it will also go in the Pcmcia package ;-)

	I'm sorry, but "XXX" doesn't mean "???" in any variation of
the english language that I've ever encoutered.

	No need to change working code.

	Thanks for the quick review...
