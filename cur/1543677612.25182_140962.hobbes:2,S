AFAIK, on ia64, it makes absolutely no sense at all to define this
magic CLOCK_TICK_RATE in timex.h.  There simply is nothing in the ia64
architecture that requires any timer to operate at 1193182 Hz.
If there are drivers that rely on the frequency, those drivers should
be fixed instead.
Please do not add CLOCK_TICK_RATE to the ia64 timex.h header file.
