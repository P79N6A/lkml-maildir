hrm.  it misbehaved on ac9 now.  i'll try a different soundcard and see
what happens.  is es1370 known to be relatively stable?  i have one of
those lying about somewhere.
i'm fairly sure its not ram at fault, since nothing else is acting
strangely, and it only crops up when i use /dev/dsp.
anything else i can try to narrow it down?  this is just a home
workstation, so i can try practically anything if necessary.
