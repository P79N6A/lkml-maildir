Hello!
We would like to offer V_I_A_G_R_A soft tabs,
These pills are just like regular Vìagra but they are specially formulated 
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue. The pill is absorbed at the 
mouth and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach. 
This results in a faster more powerful effect which lasts as long as the normal.
Soft Tabs also have less sidebacks (you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with them).
