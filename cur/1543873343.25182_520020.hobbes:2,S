But the whole point is that this is *not* a 32-bit file.
It's a file *shared* between 32-bit and 64-bit kernels.
Which is why plain "x86" is the right name. Yeah, Intel calls it "IA" 
these days, but that's just crazy speak (and probably a combination of a 
reaction against "amd64" and a way to hide the embarrassment that is 
"ia64" by confusing the naming so much that one day people won't remember 
that there was _another_ IA that was a total failure).
