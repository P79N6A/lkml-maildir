Cool.
F/S:
How are file attributes laid out on the disk?  Do you pick up
the attributes of all the files in a directory in one disk read?  Do
you use this attribute system to store permission bits and the like?
O/S:
What is the interface to read an arbitrarily-sized attribute?  Do you
use the same interface to read permission bits?
NFS:
Do you always transfer an attribute in one syscall, or do you have an
open/read/close model?  How does the buffer space to store an
arbitrarily-sized attribute get allocated in user space?  (The real
question here is: does it take two round trips -- one to get the
attribute size, and the next to do the read?)
