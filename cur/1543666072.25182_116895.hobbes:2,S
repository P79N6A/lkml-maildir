I never used it to receive netflow data.
I used netramet to generate flow information on a linux-based backbone
router, and to periodically move the flow information to another node
for batch processing/analysis.
I used the netramet tools to extract that information from the netramet
"meter" (the flow measurement daemon running on the router), for storage
on the remote accounting/processing machine. Some custom Perl scripts
process the flow information thereafter.
You asked for netflow data export. Netramet can give you something
similar to netflow (I never used netflow, but from what I hear, netramet
is similar only more flexible).

With 10 lines of Perl you could do full ASN-1   ;)
Netramet uses SNMP for the data transport - and I am very much surprised
if Cisco does not use SNMP - but again, I did not use netflow so I
wouldn't know.
In any case, to the "end user", it's as simple as calling a tool saying
"get me my data" - whether it's SNMP based or not.
Point being; if what you want is flow information from a Linux router,
excellent user space software (both "meter" and retrieval/filtering
tools) already exist for that.
If you want something else, then I have completely misread your mails.
Please elaborate, in that case  :)
