SMP safe code
Actual source code when recompiling modules
Reviewing things like driver code use of disable_irq by hand
Reviewing driver code for situations where it requires a small timing delay
	and a large one is unacceptable
Checking anywhere you use the cpu id that you don't do somthing where it
	might change under you (eg per cpu variables)
