TCP has no real out-of-band data. It has urgent data. If you see it 
as urgent data the Linux behaviour makes sense.  I don't think it is
worth the effort to change it to be 100% BSD compatible. The bug is really
that the sockets API maps urgent data to something called out-of-band
data. 
I'll document the behaviour in my network man pages.
