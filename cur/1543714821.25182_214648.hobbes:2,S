Oh, I saw the problem too: a slow client couldn't do full-size reads from
a fast server because the buffer on the client's network card was just 8k.
Granted that the client is a slow m68k Mac, but 2.4 was fast enough to get
the first packet entirely off the card before the last one overruns the
buffer -- while 2.6 has a bit more latency, so it can't.
Apparently that bit of increased latency is offset by the fact that the
machine still limps along if I packet-bomb it. Under 2.4 it locked solid,
so overall I think that the 2.6 situation is an improvement.
