You were right once more.  I was using the cdrecord version 1.10 shiped
with Debian 3.0 (woody).  After compiling the latest
cdrtools-2.00.3.tar.gz and grasping the manpage I could see the -raw96r
option.  Now the final test is to burn the cd.  But I'm sure that all be
fine.
Once again I can't thank you enough.  This 'strange' error have been killing
my brain cells all day.
My best regards, Marco.
