From the README:
 To install system-wide:
 $ python setup.py install   # change python to python2.3 if 2.2 is default
 To install in your home directory (~/bin and ~/lib, actually), run:
 $ python2.3 setup.py install --home=~
 $ export PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/lib/python  # add this to your .bashrc
 $ export PATH=${HOME}/bin:$PATH         # 
 And finally:
 $ hg                                    # test installation, show help
 If you get complaints about missing modules, you probably haven't set
 PYTHONPATH correctly.
