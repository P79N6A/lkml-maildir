/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   72 MB in  3.03 seconds =  23.80 MB/sec
Note: i just added "noapic" to my boot options.
bash-2.05b# cat /proc/cmdline
BOOT_IMAGE=bk8dev26 root=305 psmouse.proto=imps hdc=cdrom ide0=ata66 noapic
I dont know if ~24MB/sec is a good speed, but remember: the cpu is on full
usage
and the BUFF memory usage increases (and is later released again). And as i
wrote to Lionel there seem to be a linear dependency between cpu clock rate and
i/o result. Lionels words to this fact: "There seems to be an unusual amount of
cpu time spent in IRQ processing for your disk drive's accesses but I really
can't put a finger on why."
BTW: those who dont know: i made a nice "bug"-report and put it on:
http://rcswww.urz.tu-dresden.de/~s4248297/gubed/report.html
You will find all the interesting things like dmesg and hdparm -I /dev/hda
output in the "files" section.
