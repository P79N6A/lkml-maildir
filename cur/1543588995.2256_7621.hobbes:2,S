I tried vanilla 2.4.3 yesterday, on a box which has one DPTA (IDE) drive
and two Seagate SCSI drives along with a CD-ROM attached to some 2940.
Linux 2.2.19 is fine on that box, but 2.4.3 tells something about an
abort that returned some value and fails to detect what Linux 2.2 calls
/dev/sda. Reset -> Inquiry delay in kernel is 10,000 ms.
Does any of the aforementioned merges remedy detection problems or
should I try a current 2.4.3-ac version and file a full report in case
the problem persists?
