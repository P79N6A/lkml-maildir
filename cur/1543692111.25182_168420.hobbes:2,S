Have you tried it lately? I'm not sure who's behind because I've never 
used bk, but only having a look at arch and using it for a couple of 
weeks would convince anybody of the opposite. Just wait that there is a 
linux arch repo with the bk detail and facts will speak.
That's why there's the need of having all the bk linux related repos
exported to CVS, not to limit linux development. If only one of these
repos is not exported, many people have difficulties in keeping off bk. I 
appreciate you comment that all will be exported RSN.
The same that you demand respect for bk, please respect the others too and
don't spread false comments. Moreover, you are on an advantadgeous
position as you can test arch, read its code and learn -it's GPLed-, while
the rest of people can't even benchmark arch with bk as it's forbidden by 
your license. Don't misunderstand me, I'm not flaming anyone, I'm just 
exposing facts.

It would be great to keep an arch gateway with the same detail than bk 
changesets. It looks very easy to do.
