NACK, files longer than 4KB should not be symlinks, and maybe (if you're
paranoid enough) files without a magic header should not be symlinks, too.
BTW: What about storing short symlinks (strlen(name)+strlen(symlink) < 200)
in the filename as $name.modified_base64($symlink) and storing the split
position in ctime? This would reduce the need for data blocks, which may
be valuable on small devices.
