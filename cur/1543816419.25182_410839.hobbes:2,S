Coverity is correct that something is wrong:
<--  snip  -->
...
        struct dentry *dentry = group->cg_item.ci_dentry;
        int ret = 0;
        int i;
        if (group && group->default_groups) {
...
<--  snip  -->
The question is only whether the dereferencing is a real bug or there's 
only the harmless issue of a superfluous check.
