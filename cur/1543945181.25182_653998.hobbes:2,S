Perhaps what is happening is that cpu0 comes online ... safely skips
over the early printk calls.  Calls cpu_init() which sets up the resources
*it* needs (ar.k3 points to per-cpu space), and then executes
sched_init() which marks it safe for all printk's. Then cpu1 comes
up and does a printk before it gets to cpu_init().
Try with Ingo patch and CONFIG_SMP=n to see if you can come
up on a uni-processor.
