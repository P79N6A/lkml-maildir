The patch needs to do some kind of work in kernel_pmd_ctor() and
introduce a kernel_pmd_dtor() and do things analogous to what the
re-slabification patches are doing for the non-PAE case in order to fix
the bugs where pageattr.c doesn't get a chance to clean up cached pgd's
and add a pmd invalidation loop to set_pmd_pte() in pageattr.c.
