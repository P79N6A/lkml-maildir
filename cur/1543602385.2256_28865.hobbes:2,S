Currently, you can't. 
I've added a GFP_FAIL flag at 2.4.5-ac1 to be used by the bounce buffering
allocation code to avoid highmem deadlocks, but it was removed due to no
more need.

 is a
similar patch which I proposed to the XFS people)
The only problem by of a GFP_FAIL flag for some users is that it cannot
fail _too_ easily. Think about the SCSI layer trying to allocate big
memory chunks to do more effective (bigger) scatter-gather transfers.
If we use GFP_FAIL to mean "get memory without any efforts", the
scatter-gather big tables are never going to happen, thus we'll have
crappy performance. For _those_ kind of allocations, we want to try a bit
more instead failing so easily. See?
Thats why I think Linus will not like such a flag with no exact meaning.
Well, ask him. :)
