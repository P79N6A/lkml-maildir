Let me try again.
For workloads where plugging helps (ie. lots of smaller, contiguous
requests going into the IO layer), the request pattern should be
pretty good without plugging these days, due to multiple page
readahead and writeback.

Taken to its logical conclusion, you are saying readahead / dirty
page writeout throttling is obviously inferior, aren't you?
Non-rhetorically: Obviously there can be regressions in plugging,
because you are holding the disk idle when you know there is work to
be done.
