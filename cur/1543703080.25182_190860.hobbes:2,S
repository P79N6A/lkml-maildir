Hi,
I would like to know the access to a particular partition on a disk. In 2.4, I used the 'request' structure in the ide-disk.c to obtain the exact drive I was accessing(reading/writing). But, in 2.6, gendisk is being introduced, and I am unable to get to the exact drive I would like to trace. Could someone help me to find the exact drive from within the kernel.
I tried using the gendisk->minor, but that did not help me, as it gave value 64 always, even if I made read/write on different disks. gendisk->major is 3. How do I catch the other partitions/drives?
From what I know, the partition values are now shifted to block layer. Could you help me find out the exact place, from where I could find out the partition details.
Thanks in advance,
Sumit
