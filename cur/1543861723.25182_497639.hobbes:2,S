That's not correct.  freeze_processes() will freeze *all* processes.  All
of them are forced to enter refrigerator().  With the mysterious exception
of some I/O-related kernel threads, which might need some thought.

Am not sure how that's related.

It could be that the freezer needs a bit of work for this application. 
Obviously we're not interested in the handling of disk I/O, so we'd really
like to do a simple
try_to_freeze_tasks(FREEZER_USER_SPACE|FREEZER_KERNEL_THREADS), but the
code isn't set up to do that (it should be).  The other non-swsusp callers
probably want this change as well.  But that's all a minor matter.
