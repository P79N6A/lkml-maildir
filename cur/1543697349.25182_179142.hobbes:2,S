No.  You really don't want to -- the native instruction set doesn't
look like anything Linux likes to see, and worse, there are binary
incompatibilities not just from processor to processor but sometimes
from silicon revision to silicon revision.
It's also not faster in any meaningful way, since the dynamic
translator does optimistic optimization.

The biggest problem we've found is that a lot of distributions will
install an i586 libc even though we have (and export) all the
necessary features.  Crusoe reports family = 5 mainly to work around a
bug in Some Other Operating System[TM], but supports all
userspace-visible i686 features gcc expects.
