Well the scsi and ide way is that the next controller continues with tfe
f g h, and the next controller has tfi j k and l, etc.  Doesn't mean you
should do it that way, just that that is how it is done for ide and scsi
when multiple controllers are present.  After all normal ide controllers
handle 4 disks maximum (through two ports).  A system with two dual port
ide controllers would have hda ... hdh.
