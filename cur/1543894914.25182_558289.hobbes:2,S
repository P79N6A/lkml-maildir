I'm puzzled.  The cpuinfo shows that this cpu doesn't have speedstep, so
why acpi-cpufreq successfully loads is a mystery.
What's in/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies  ?
Maybe the acpi implementation is faking multiple speeds using throttling
a la p4-clockmod, which would be a bit loopy, but possible I guess.
