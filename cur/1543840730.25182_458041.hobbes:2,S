Please use inline patches if your mail system supports/allows it.
Attachments make it difficult to review a patch.
(now do some cp-n-paste for comments)
+/* Bits 10 of command_set_1 and cfs_enable_1 must be equal,
+ * so on non-buggy drives we need test only one.
+ * However, we should also check whether these fields are valid.

Long comment style in Linux is:
/*
 * foo bar
 * comments
 */
+static inline int idedisk_supports_hpa(const struct hd_driveid *id)
+{
+        return (id->command_set_1 & 0x0400) && (id->cfs_enable_1 & 0x0400);
+}
Please use a #defined value for the 0x400.
(Yes, you just moved it from somewhere else.)
+	/* check to see if this is a hard drive
+	 * if it is then checkhpa needs to be
+	 * disabled */
Comment style again.
+	if(drive->media == ide_disk && idedisk_supports_hpa(drive->id))
space after "if".
