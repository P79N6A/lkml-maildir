Subject: kexec x86_64: VFS: Cannot open root device, kernel panic

On x86_64 I am trying out kexec/kdump
The root fs is reiserfs
1. Boot the current kernel with crashkernel=64M@16M 
2. # cat /proc/cmdline
root=/dev/cciss/c0d0p5 selinux=0
resume=/dev/cciss/c0d0p3  splash=silent numa
=off crashkernel=64M@16M
3. Preload the capture kernel using
kexec --load-panic /boot/vmlinux-2.6.16-rc4-3-kdump
--args-linux --append="root=
/dev/cciss/c0d0p5 selinux=0 resume=/dev/cciss/c0d0p3
splash=silent numa=off"
4. force  a panic echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
 
While booting the capture kernel, it panics with the
following message:
 
VFS: Cannot open root device "cciss/c0d0p5" or
unknown-block(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root
fs on unknown-block(0,0)
 
1. When the capture kernel boots what happens to the
io/nw drivers and any other modules which were
inserted into the first kernel
2. Is there anything wrong with the steps I followed
