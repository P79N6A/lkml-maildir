OK, this is getting a little silly, and I don't have many new arguments
to make, so I'll just respond once.  Feel free to have the last word :-).
Peeling information off memory sticks would be silly.  It's already _on_
them memory, and it costs nothing to leave it there.  Moreover, if you're
using a packaging system, putting config info in the package is precisely
analogous to attaching an informative sticker to the kernel.
Adding configuration information to the kernel is a change to the status
quo, and has a cost.  The cost is small, but I'm unsympathetic to that
argument because many small convenience features, each with a small cost,
add up to a large cost.
You appear to be justifying a change to the kernel status quo with the
argument "it is a useful feature for some people, so it should go in".
I agree that it's useful for some people, but I feel that the kernel
should hold to a higher standard for feature inclusion: "It's a useful
feature for some people, and it is impossible or impractical to implement
it well in userspace."  Even esoteric drivers meet my test; IMHO the
inclusion of configuration files in the kernel does not.
My contention is that not only is it _possible_ to implement a solution
in userspace (which alone should be enough), but that a userspace solution
is _already implemented and widely used_, and that moreover I am perfectly
happy using it.  I don't see why that shouldn't be the kiss of death for
adding a new feature to the kernel.
