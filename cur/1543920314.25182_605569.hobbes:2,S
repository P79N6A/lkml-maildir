git-scsi-misc adds this:
struct scsi_eh_save {
	int result;
	enum dma_data_direction data_direction;
	unsigned char cmd_len;
	unsigned char cmnd[MAX_COMMAND_SIZE];
	void *buffer;
	unsigned bufflen;
	unsigned short use_sg;
	int resid;
	struct scatterlist sense_sgl;
};
which will not compile unless the includer has earlier included
scatterlist.h.
