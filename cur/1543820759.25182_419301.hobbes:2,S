How do you get correct mode and ownership? The kernel doesn't handle
that either. If you need something special, you use the tools to set it
(chmod, chgrp, ...). Ditto for SELinux.
Users already have to deal with that: fetchmail will fail to run if
~/.fetchmailrc has more permissions than 0600.
SELinux can make it even easier for you if you want: 
It has a database which stores the default labels for files. You can use
"restorecon $file" to set the default label for any file. You can also
change your editor so it queries this database and sets the right label
when saving a new file.
Fedora also just added restorecond, a small daemon which uses inotify to
watch certain paths and set the right label when the file or directory
is created. Reportedly it works very well, so you can do a
	mkdir public_html; ls -lZd public_html
and already see the right label on the file.

Well, then I don't understand your threat model. When I move files to
another place I certainly don't want the label to change. Imagine Linux
did this on file permissions and suddenly everyone could read your
passwords out of your .fetchmailrc.old which you saved there for backup.

Users already set modes themselves (see .fetchmailrc, .ssh,
public_html), so I don't see a problem with them calling restorecon
(see above).

I don't think that fits the Unix model. If you want that you should use
separate directories.
Giving untrusted programs write access to your homedir is a bad idea,
but even if you need to do that, SELinux can protect you. In this
specific example, procmail would simply not be allowed to read files
created by untrusted programs (e.g. your IRC client).

Certainly there are things which could be made better - both
documentation and userspace-tools. But I don't think it requires
changing the kernel mechanism.
