Grrr..
 We have a mixed environment here. We are running 60+ Linux boxes, a few
Suns (Solaris 2.6) and our main AFS and NFS file servers are IBMs running
AIX 4.3.2 . On the Linux boxes, we are running the 2.2.2 kernel since
that is the current supported kernel by Transarc for AFS. AFS seems stable,
and NFS to the *Suns* is stable, but writing to the AIX nfs servers is
very confusing. Short comopiles writing to AIX/NFS are fine, but large
operations (like compiling CVS source) result in corrupted object files,
and linking fails with many errors. The same operation but on the Sun
NFS mounts works fine, every time. I *know* I'm not the only one to see this.
Is there anything we can do to make this work? We are sorta locked into
the 2.2.2 kernel...
Thanks,
Tim
