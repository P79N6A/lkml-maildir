This is a rewrite of the scheduler policy for 2.6, based on the current
O(1) scheduler.
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.7-rc1/experimental/patch-2.6.7-rc1-s5.5
Here is a link to the original announcement email:

This release is mainly a bugfix and resync with 2.6.7-rc1. Some issues have 
been addressed with the bugfixes, and the overall design has not changed 
dramatically.
The previous version was run on a machine with 50 days of moderate use uptime 
suggesting reasonably good stability. I have yet to find any serious bugs 
with this release.
Please feel free to test and report back. Note I am quite aware there are 
still quirks, but for normal daily use it works very well at the moment. 
Depending on the level of interest I will decide how much to develop it.
