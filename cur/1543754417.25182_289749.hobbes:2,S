After writing the "- - -" to the scan attribute, the management applications
assume the udev has created the relevant entries in the /dev directly and
try to use the devices _immediately_ and fail to see the devices
Is there a hotplug event which would tell the management applications that
the device nodes have actually been created now and ready to be used?
I tried this simple script to re-create the failure. Assume there is one
scsi disk, which is the installation disk. Now load the megaraid driver,
with a few logical drive already created.
# insmod megaraid_mm.ko; insmod megaraid_mbox.ko; ls -l /dev/sd*
<driver loads>
<not all scsi devices are available>
<try again after a brief delay>
# ls -l /dev/sd*	# all devices show up now
Thanks
