Has this potential degradation been measured?  This is a lot of extra
complexity which needs to justified by the resulting performance.

It seems to me that a type with a name which better matches the intended
semantics would be a better choice than u64.  Even something like ino64_t
would help file systems maintainers to correctly implement the appropriate
support.
