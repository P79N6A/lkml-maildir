Hi Folks!
Here is an update to the Kernel Cross Compiling thread 
I started ten days ago ...
1) CROSS COMPILER / TOOLCHAIN
   there are different solutions for the toolchain issue:
     - Dan Kegel's Crosstool [1]
     - PTXdist [2]
     - my simplified approach [3]
   in one mail [Ref-A], Jim Wilson mentioned that using the 
   'inhibit_libc' trick will break the gcc in a subtly way, 
   so I decided to verify the fitness of the compiled gcc.
   because 'normal' checks won't work without the glibc and
   the includes, I decided to take the following approach:
     - build gcc 3.3.2 with Dan's crosstool, and with my 
       simplified approach.
     - select all tests from the test suite which contain
       tests relevant for the kernel (no floats, no (g)libc
       includes)
     - compile each C source into Assembler code (gcc -O2 -S)
       with both compilers (crosstool gcc version and mine)
     - compare the resulting Assembler code and check for
       differences
   the GCC testsuite contains 2854 files in the relevant 
   subdirs consistency.vlad, gcc.c-torture, gcc.dg, and
   gcc.misc-tests.
   after removing the non relevant tests (file matching 
   egrep '#include|float|double') 1799 C files remain.
     
   the result of the tests and comparison[4] shows that
   both compilers produce the same code, except for one
   little difference[5], which I'm unable to explain ...  
   my conclusion so far is that my approach should be
   sufficient for Kernel Cross Compiling.

   interesting is that some architectures (arm, chris, v850)
   do not even have an appropriate default config, where 
   others seem to require different? binutils (sh and sh64)
   but most other issues seem to be inconsistent configs or
   broken headers/code (details [6])... 
   
   mips/mips64 seems to break because of an cpu= option 
   which was depreciated in gcc some time ago, so they might
   build again if those changes are merged back into mainline
   
   hppa/hppa64 seems to require heavy patches to make them
   compile, which might be too intrusive to get into mainline
   very soon.

   the logs[7] for the 2.4.25 kernel build suggest similar
   reasons for similar architectures (compared to 2.6.3)
3) CONCLUSIONS
   it seems that the fast/easy way to build a cross gcc
   compiler (at least on x86 ;) is sufficient for kernel
   cross compile tests. 
   6/7 out of 19 'supported' architectures are currently 
   building with the kernel default configuration, when 
   cross compiled in an x86 host (about a third).
   
best,
Herbert
