Shrug - the chip documentation isn't good enough to indicate either.
What I do know is:
- setting the bridge and eepro100 up with 16-bit IO addresses causes PCI
  master aborts.
- setting the bridge and eepro100 up with 32-bit IO addresses which
  correspond to the host MMIO region, it works perfectly.
It appears that the first bridge converts the mmio access into a PCI
IO read/write cycle without any address translation.  So, when I
access mmio 0x90011000, it would appear to cause a PCI IO cycle at
the same address.
The MMIO region for this bus is 0x90010000 - 0x9001ffff, so its impossible
to test the effect of different upper 16-bits.
I suppose I could waste some time by getting Linux to generate lots of IO
cycles and scoping the PCI bus lines to find the PCI address, but I think
its rather academic in light of the above.
