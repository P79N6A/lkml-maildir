Well the allocation structure used to be kmalloc'ed and free'd by this
function and gfs2_alloc_get. I changed that to put it inline in the
struct gfs2_inode since there didn't seem a lot of point in having it
dynamically allocated. I had left this function though since it was
useful to have some demarcation points in the code which showed where
the structure was in use. My plan was to later add some debugging to
detect any use outside of those points, hence, I'd left in this
function.
It could be removed now, but I'd prefer to give it a stay of execution
for a little while at least if nobody has any strong objections to that,
Steve.
