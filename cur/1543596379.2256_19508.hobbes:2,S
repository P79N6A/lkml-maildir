Running 2.4.6-pre and 2.4.6 proper on several machines. Quite busy and all
have 256 to 512MB of RAM. As I type this, I am in the process of converting
an entire production server farm over to 2.4.6 from 2.2.19 as the 2.4.6-pre
series proved out well on a test machine in that farm.  No stability
problems at all. The only reboots were for patching up the kernel to the
next -pre revision on that test box.
