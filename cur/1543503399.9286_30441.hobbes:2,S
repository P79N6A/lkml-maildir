Well I've eventually managed to get something that boots, secret here is that 
"Enable loadable module support" doesn't and you have to select the "Kernel 
module loader" as well (this is non obvious), but there is nothing I can do to 
make nfs work with this kernel -- the config just refuses to even offer me 
"nfs server" and xconfig just shows it greyed-out so the rpc.nfsd just gets an 
ENOSYS.  (Any suggestions why 2.2.10 does not support nfs serving?????)
With no nfsd, these servers might as well be crashed.
Looks increasingly like I will have to backoff to redhat 5.2 on these machines.
Richard.
