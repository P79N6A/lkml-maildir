Doesn't the kernel always create the main block device for this device?
If so, udev will catch that.  If not, there's no way udev will work for
this kind of device, sorry.  You could make a script that just creates
the device node in /tmp, runs dd on it, and then cleans it all up to
force partition scanning.
