I think we have terminological problems here.  I know that the
various kinds of sedation are termed differently by different
manufacturers, but usually:
'standby' refers to a state of mildly reduced power consumption
which can be ended immediately;
'suspend' refers to a state of severely reduced power
consumption in which peripherals are switched off but the
CPU and RAM are kept powered up;
'hibernation' refers to a state of zero power consumption
in which the entire system state is saved to disk and the
machine is powered off.
On a ThinkPad, standby seems to consist of the screen 
being switched off.  Suspend and hibernation are as 
described above.
