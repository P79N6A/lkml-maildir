It's a fairly standard term. Basically, it means that some feature
(interpreted broadly, e.g. "compiles this piece of code correctly")
worked in version X but fails to do so due to a bug (as opposed to a
feature change or removal) in version Y, where Y>X. Most often, the first
step of fixing the problem is increasing X or decreasing Y successively so
that X==Y-1.
