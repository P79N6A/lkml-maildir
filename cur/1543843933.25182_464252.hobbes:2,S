I did another run and confirmed this. The tcpdump capture shows that
seven retransmits are sent, obeying the exponential backoff. Then
something odd happens. Instead of the 8th retransmit at 7th + 26.88
seconds, there is an arp at 7th + 4.159722 seconds. There are three
arps in fact, each one second apart and directed to the MAC of the
powered-off machine. After this there are further arps (in groups of
three one second apart), but they are broadcast and have a backoff
schedule.
The kernel debugging shows that tcp_write_timeout() and
tcp_retransmit_timer() are still being called though, right up to what
would be the 16th retransmit.
I suppose that the TCP retransmits aren't being sent because the
ethernet and/or IP layers don't know what's going on, which is what's
producing the arps. Is that correct? Is that documented anywhere?
I was expecting to see all 15 retransmits, and was confused when I
didn't see them.
