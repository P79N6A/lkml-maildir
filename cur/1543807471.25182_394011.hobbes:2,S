Nah, we can just special-case the lookup for pid==1 to always return the
single real init, or insert the single real init into the pidhash for
every container.
If we're going to provide the option which you need to have your own
init, then I guess the best behavior is to add a flag to whatever
mechanism creates a container specifying to either hash the real init
into the pidhash, or make the first exec()d process the container's
init?  Does that seem reasonable?
