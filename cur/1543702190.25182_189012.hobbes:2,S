Hi,
I have released kgdb 2.0 for kernel 2.6.0 for i386 and x86_64 architectures at 
http://kgdb.sourceforge.net
.
This version of kgdb has been supported by TimeSys Corporation and Storad Inc. 
It contains code from kgdb patches maintained by Andrew Morton (George 
Anzinger), Andi Kleen and Jim Housten.
Significant changes since previous version:
1. This version contains three patches: architecture specific patches for i386 
and x86_64 and a common patch.
2. Automatic loading of modules in gdb is available on x86_64 platform now. 
Debugging of modules, including those in initrd, should be trivial with this 
feature.
3. Hasslefree detach and reconnect from gdb possible on x86_64 platform also.
4. New format of kgdb kernel command line options: kgdbwait, kgdb8250.
5. Shadow thread to get backtraces lost when gdb can't go beyond do_IRQ.
6. Uses new thread list packet qf instead of qL. This fixes the thread 
information loss previous versions of kgdb had.
