Oh right, my bad.
At normal logging levels, the largest output is from stuff like this
Zone PFN ranges:
  DMA          1024 ->   262144
  Normal     262144 ->   262144
early_node_map[3] active PFN ranges
  0:     1024 ->    30719
  0:    32768 ->    65413
  0:    65440 ->    65505
So, that is one line per zone, one line per map entry (that can get
large). There is also lines outputting pages used for memmap, that's
more lines per zone and the DMA zone reserve.
Ok.... it's adding up.
With loglevel at KERN_DEBUG, there can be a very large number of lines
like
Entering add_active_range(0, 1024, 30719) 0 entries of 256 used
I see your point. I'll look into doing something like apic_printk().
