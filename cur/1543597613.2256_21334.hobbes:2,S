Inactive shortage and free shortage are different things.
Think about the case where you have high inactive shortage and no free
shortage at all.
It is a valid and real case.

There is no problem with such a case. (if that is what you mean) 
        /* 
         * If we are doing a zone-specific scan, do not
         * touch pages from zones which don't have a 
         * shortage.
         */
        if (zone && !zone_inactive_shortage(page->zone))
                return;
We will always do pte aging for zones which have an inactive shortage, if
doing zone specific scanning or not.

The "zone" parameter passed to swap_out() means "don't unmap pte's mapping
to pages belonging to not-under-shortage zones". It can (and it should) be
replaced by a "zone_specific" parameter.

I haven't exactly understood what you mean here, but I suppose changing
"zone_t *zone" to "int zone_specific" paramater answers your question,
right ? 
Or I'm missing something ?
