This is just a 'me too' plus a fix that works for me.  Hopefully it'll
help someone else.  My symtoms were USB works, foredeth (network)
doesn't.
I have an nforce2 MB etc etc., and got everything working by:
1) recompiling kernel with UP LOCAL-APIC and IO-APIC support.
2) enabling APIC support in BIOS options.
Now it works.
