2.2.11 has a Tcp/Ip memory leak in it where as 2.2.12 has a slow page
leak..  my "guess" is most people tend to use more tcp/ip on there Linux
boxes than pageing .  I am suprised indeed that you had such long
uptimes with 2.2.11

I have not tried any of the 2.2.13 kernels yet so cannot say.. with
2.2.12 I am just watching my system closely watching the system to see
'signs' that it is starting to act funny, paying particular attention to
the memory. With 2.2.11 my system froze completely, where as 2.2.12 has
not done that.
If you want to run 2.2.11 pathced the patch is at
http://www.linux.org.uk/VERSION/relnotes.2211.html
the patch for 2.2.12 is
http://www.linux.org.uk/VERSION/relnotes.2212.html
Oh some of the "signs" that I watch for are programs behaving
differently.  One example is a program I had written in Perl::Tk.  After
my system was up for 15 days the program would crash an window redraws.
If I opened up a gnome term it may crash, if I had two instances opend
it would crash if I minimized one.  After I re****ed (bad word on this
list :-O) the system the crashes went away.  Apparently the memory had
gotton to low or something and was causing the crashes.   And no it was
not my code as it is fine after the re****.
Personally I wish that when 2.2.11 was released and found to have a mem
leak it was either pulled or 2.2.12 was released with just the fix for
2.2.11.  If you patch 2.2.11 you cannot then patch it to 2.2.12 without
modifing the 2.2.12 patch.  2.2.13 should have been released with just a
fix for 2.2.12, but that is just my opinion. Incidentally this prompted
me to write a little gnome app to show my uptime in the gnome panel :-)

I think it prompts something like "vmware does not have modukles for
your system, do you want it to build them for you?"   This could be
because I have an smp system and they may not distribute smp modules.

did you get the additional utilities they have? I run "that other OS"
(hope this acts as flame retardant :-O) under vmware at 800x600 and can
get it up to 1024x768.. in full screen mode.. no problems..

doh!

I only wonder why they do not use the existing drivers and they write
there own?
