100% agreed. People really are going too far IMO.
Given that most people will never read those comments, the
effort would be much better spent proof-reading/correcting
documentation than comments.
The "its just a spelling mistake, it cant break the build!"
mantra is also way off base. If you touch a .c/.h file, you
introduce the possibility of breakage.
The cant -> can't pedantry is an example of just how extremely
silly these are getting. Is there really someone who sees
"cant" and doesn't understand what it could mean?
It just pedantic masturbation AFAICS.
