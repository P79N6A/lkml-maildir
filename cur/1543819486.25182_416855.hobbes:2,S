Hi Jens,
Instead of reading the status register and returning ide_stopped
from the handler, which was resulting in the 'status error', I 
tried ending the request and returning ide_stopped when the drive
is in a confused state. Using this I dont see the status error.
Following is the patch, kindly review.
Thanks
Rachita
