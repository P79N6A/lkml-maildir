Oh, I left one other thing out: writeq() and __raw_writeq() shold be
atomic in the sense that no other transactions should be able to get
onto the IO bus in the middle -- so implementing writeq() as two
writel()s in a row is not allowed

Yes, I agree that's a good plan, especially the documentation part.
However I would argue that what's in drivers/infiniband/hw/mthca/mthca_doorbell.h 
is legitimate: the driver uses __raw_writeq() when it exists and uses
two __raw_writel()s properly serialized with a device-specific lock to
get exactly the atomicity it needs on 32-bit archs.
It's an open question what drivers that don't actually need atomicity
but just want a convenient way to write 64 bits at time should do.
