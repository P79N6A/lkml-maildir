Well, you use event device in any case; as for finding right one - I guess
you look at device capabilities and filter what you need ...
{pts/0}%
cat /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXPWRBN:00/input/input1/capabilities/key
100000 0 0 0
you could also check name but I guess it is unreliable
{pts/0}% cat /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXPWRBN:00/input/input1/name
Power Button (FF)
Then you have your event device:
{pts/0}% ll -d /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXPWRBN:00/input/input1/event1
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 2008-01-07
15:32 /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXPWRBN:00/input/input1/event1/
the problem that you *really* have - nobody prevents user from using udev to
renaming /dev/input/event1 away into anything (s)he likes. Of course you
could do
{pts/0}%
udevinfo --query=name --path /devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXPWRBN:00/input/input1/event1
input/event1
.. but at some point we have to commit to support this interface forever.

I ask myself about LNXVIDEO as well.
