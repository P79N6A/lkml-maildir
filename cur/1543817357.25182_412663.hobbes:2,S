While useful, I don't think it is critical.  As you mention, it is possible
to do this by creating a lot of directories, though it might be tedious
(need over 16k directories for a 2TB filesystem, 64k for an 8TB fs).
Also, since this increases the allocation for each inode's reservation from
16 bytes to 20 (really 32 because it is in a slab), it might have a small
performance hit.
If it was available under some sort of compile-time configuration option
it might make sense for developers.
Cheers, Andreas
