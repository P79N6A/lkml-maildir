Con, those cycles are not "magic", if you look at the numbers, the time is
not spent in the process itself. From what has been observed since the
beginning, it is spent :
  - in other processes which are starvating the CPU (eg: X11 when xterm
    scrolls)
  - in context switches when you have a pipe somewhere and the CPU is
    bouncing between tasks.
Concerning your angriness about me being OK with (0,0) and still
asking for tunables, it's precisely because I know that *my* workload
is not everyone else's, and I don't want to conclude too quickly that
there are only two types of workloads. Maybe you're right, maybe you're
wrong. At least you're right for as long as no other workload has been
identified. But thinking like this is like some time ago when we thought
that "if it runs XMMS without skipping, it'll be OK for everyone".
