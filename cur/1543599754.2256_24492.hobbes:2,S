Is there anybody here from IBM that might be able to get in contact with
me?  I need to ask some questions concerning getting some hardware
documentation on the IBM Net Camera (produced by xirlink).  I've tried to
get a hold of someone there that might be able to get me some
documentation but all the seem to think I need is windows API docs
*shrug*.  Here's a good chance for you guys to help linux without having
to spend a billion dollars, lol :-D .  No offense intended of course.
Just trying to write a driver for this webcam that I bought, thought it
might be a bit easier to ask rather than trying to hack this out on my
own.  Mostly what I'm concerned about is control documentation and the
data compression format of the data coming from the camera.
