There is a firmware upgrade you need to obtain from WD if you are using their 
drives with a 3Ware controller.  The WD drives were optimized for desktop use
and they go into a "powersave" mode of sorts which will cause them to disappear
and reappear mysteriously with all sorts of strange errors.  WD is aware of 
this problem and so is 3Ware.
