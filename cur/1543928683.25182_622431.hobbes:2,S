If the IGNORE_DEVICE flag is set, access to the device's virtual-cd is
no longer possible, and might not be the correct approach. Just as an
example, one of my country's ISP has an ini file on it, with quite
relevant information: Dial number, login, password and APN. Of course
that, all of this information could be obtained with a simple phone call
to that ISP.
Just to remember that that specific flag was one SET and, was removed,
in part, because of what I state. Of course we aim at perfection but, if
the benefits are only for a few situations and, will cause all this
problems for all other, perhaps the reinsert of that flag would be a
positive action.
