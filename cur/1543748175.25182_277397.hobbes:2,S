If find_vma() returns NULL, it is bad_area, and no further tests occur.  Otherwise
if vma->vm_start <= address, it is good area.
Only when these two conditions are satisifed (find_vma found vma, and this vma begins
above vma's vm_start, regs->esp is checked.  And as vma->vm_start can be at most 
0xFFFFF000 (it is page aligned, and you cannot have vma at 4GB - actually you cannot 
have vma above 3GB on normal kernel, or 4GB-<whatever>MB on 4G/4G kernel), there is 
no way how 'address' could be in top 4KB, and so adding 32 to it cannot overflow 
32bit variable.
At least I believe this...
