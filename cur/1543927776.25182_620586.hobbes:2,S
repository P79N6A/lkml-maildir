That's not true.  When packets are in flight, references go
to the device and the device cannot be unloaded until those
references get dropped.
This behavior makes sense because otherwise you have to figure
out the myriad of references (each ipv4 address, each ipv6
address, routes, ARP entries, etc.) just to perform such a
simple operation.
If you do not mean to unload the device, simply do not do it.
