Hi, everybody.
I wonder does anybody try to compile 2.3 kernels at all ? I'm not for a
blood, but I can't understand how can it be that _EIGHTH_ 2.3.43 pre in a
row have drivers/block/xor.c required for RAID5 missing ? I can't understand
how could anybody hasn't noticed that the thing fails even the "make dep"...
I can't understand that nobody has noticed that wanpipe does not build in
several _RELEASED_ kernels in a row because somebody has removed enable_IPX
and network_number that are spread all over the wan drivers code from
include/linux/wanrouter.h...
People, what's going on ?  I can't believe that somebody did succed in
kernel compile having such mistakes in a source tree :(( It looks like
nobody has even tried to compile them, less for booting... How can it be
tested if it fails even to compile due to obvious mistakes ? Or it has not
to be tested at all ?
