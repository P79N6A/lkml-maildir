Right. In order to use freezer for CPU hotplug, we need to perform

Ok. A minor doubt.
When you say FROZEN, do you mean frozen due to suspend ? If yes, then
it makes sense. Otherwise once cpu-hotplug starts using the freezer
(hopefully it will someday soon
:-)) won't this patch become redundant ? [Except of course fixing a few glitches
due to the assumption that the system is fully functional, when it's
actually frozen.]
I am of the opinion that we should have notifications which help the
cpu-hotplug aware
subsystems differentiate between a normal cpu-hotplug  and a
cpu-hotplug initiated by
suspend. Thereby they can handle it accordingly and not destroy any
percpu resources
and reuse them instead during resume.
Am I missing something?

Other than that, I am ok with the patch.
