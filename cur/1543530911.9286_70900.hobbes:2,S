   No, allocated. I was assuming a system without overcommitment of memory.

   Too bad the OOM killer may kill your program anyway in an OOM situation
to free up memory. So touching every page still doesn't get you anything.
You did manage to kill performance, though. The system will run slower when
touching each and every page becomes a standard measure in glibc, etc.
