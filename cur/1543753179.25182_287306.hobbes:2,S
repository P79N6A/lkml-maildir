I have no problem with proposing my patch. The reason I've been waiting 
is that I got information from Jim Getttys (of HP) that the SD spec. 
would be made public very soon. So I was waiting for it to be released 
so that we could avoid the legal discussion completely. This was in 
october though and I haven't been able to reach him for an update. So 
perhaps it's time to try a submission notetheless.
What is Russell's position on this issue? After all the MMC layer is his 
baby ;)
