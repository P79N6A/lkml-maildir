I know that, but for my setup at least, there seems to be a need for a 
non-power of two cache between 512 and 1024. What I am seeing is average 
allocation size for kmalloc-512 being around 270-280 which wastes total 
of 10 KB of memory due to internal fragmentation. Might be a buggy caller 
that can be fixed with its own cache too.

Curious, /proc/meminfo immediately after boot shows:
SLUB (debugging enabled):
(none):~# cat /proc/meminfo 
MemTotal:        30260 kB
MemFree:         22096 kB
SLUB (debugging disabled):
(none):~# cat /proc/meminfo 
MemTotal:        30276 kB
MemFree:         22244 kB
SLOB:
(none):~# cat /proc/meminfo 
MemTotal:        30280 kB
MemFree:         22004 kB
That's 92 KB advantage for SLUB with debugging enabled and 240 KB when 
debugging is disabled.
Nick, Matt, care to retest SLUB and SLOB for your setups?
