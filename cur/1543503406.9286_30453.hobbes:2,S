Hi,
I'm trying to get 2.3.10 to work on Alpha. However it will not boot
cause the SCSI card driver has a problem:
sym53c8xx: at PCI bus 1, device 13, function 0
sym53c8xx: setting PCI_COMMAND_PARITY
sym53c8xx: rev=0x03, base=0xb100000, io_port=0x9000, irq=20
sym53c8xx: ID 7, Fast-20, Parity Checking
sym53c8xx: on-chip RAM at 0xb101000
CACHE TEST FAILED: script execution failed
sym53c8xx: start=802b5cf8, pc=802b5cf8, end=802b5d18
sym53c8xx: CACHE INCORRECTLY CONFIGURED...: giving up...
(copied by hand, not sure if the all the sym53c8xx bits are correct)
and of course the kernel eventually panics cause it can't mount
anything.
It's not to do with the driver, cause i copied the sym538xx files
from 2.2.10, where it all works fine. The ncr53c8xx driver does the
exact same thing. So it must be a more fundamental change. I also had
the exact same thing when i tried to boot a 2.2.7-ac kernel a good
while ago.
Here's the message from 2.2 where it works fine:
sym53c8xx: at PCI bus 1, device 13, function 0  
sym53c8xx: 53c875 detected   
sym53c875-0: rev=0x03, base=0xb100000, io_port=0x9000, irq=20  
sym53c875-0: ID 7, Fast-20, Parity Checking  
sym53c875-0: on-chip RAM at 0xb101000  
sym53c875-0: restart (scsi reset).  
sym53c875-0: Downloading SCSI SCRIPTS.  
scsi0 : sym53c8xx - version 1.3c
The machine is a Samsung Alpha 21164A 600MHz, Samsung PC164UX
motherboard. AFAIK 2.3.10 works fine on the original Digital
machines. 
regards,
