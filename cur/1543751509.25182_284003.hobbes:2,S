With split interfaces (machine-/human-readable) as proposed a few months
ago, we wouldn't need to clutter /proc with such cruft. We could simply
add the obvious field to /proc/maps and add another field to nproc.
Using procfs for both humans and software means over time it will get
worse for _both_ sides, and switching to a saner solution won't get
cheaper, either. I still believe we should bite that bullet now.
