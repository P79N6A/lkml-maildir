I am not sure I understand this description correctly, but it looks
pretty much like what d_splice_alias() is supposed to do according to
the comment on top of it.
What I missed is that inode can have no more than one disconnected
dentry even if it has multiple names. Hence when lookup-by-name happens
list we can d_move disconnected dentry in place of the named one. This
is no worse that what is done currently by d_find_alias() that
identifies disconnected dentry with arbitrary connected.
