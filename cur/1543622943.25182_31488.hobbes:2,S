Another possibility in this same vein is if you're a board level
manufacturer integrating somebody elses silicon, prod the chip
manufacturer to help with a driver (GPLed code, docs, whatever). It
costs you very little, and you get to claim Linux support. If your extra
(binary) firmware only works with your card (technical or market
reasons, doesn't matter) you aren't giving away the store any more than
with a closed driver.
