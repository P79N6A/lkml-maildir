There are multiple "blocked" fields to deal with. drive->blocked
indicates we can't feed it commands because it is blocked due to
power management.
idedisk_suspend sets the drive->blocked field so that we panic if
anything is sent to the disk after we turned it off (since it
would be a corrupter).
idedisk_resume is called on the resume path and marks the drive
as safe to use.
So if you hit that bug, you did I/O after shutting the drive down,
which is not allowed.
