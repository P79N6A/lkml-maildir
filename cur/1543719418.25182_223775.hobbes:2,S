As an aside, it seems like gcc-3.3.3 is pretty good.
There are some known problems with it, but the number is small.
I haven't tried gcc-3.4.0 much yet, but I have seen a few kernel patches
to fix issues 3.4.0 found in the kernel source.
I agree 2.6 should continue to support and compile correctly under gcc-2.95.3,
even if that means working around compiler bugs.  By the time linux-2.7
rolls around, I suspect nobody will mind if we drop 2.95.3 in favor
of 3.4.x.  It'll be interesting to see if newer gccs optimize the kernel better...
