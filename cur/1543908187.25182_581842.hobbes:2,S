It comes out of the device tree, just like a regular kernel. The
device tree for the kdump kernel is built by kexec-tools, it parses
/proc/device-tree and does a bunch of logic to avoid various reserved
regions: the kernel, TCE tables, RTAS etc.

maxcpus is poorly tested and is known to be broken on Cell, please
don't use it, or fix it first :)
