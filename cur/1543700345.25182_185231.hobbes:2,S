i am really sorry to have wasted anyones time but i
found when i moved
from 2.4 to 2.6 the network cards numbers got switched
around and the init
script wasn't bringing up the right card i'm not sure
why they switch
around and assume this is only a big problem to people
running gentoo     
again a apologies for wasting peoples time
 regards
ewan paton
