For the specific case that is clearly the better solution,
as it already exists, and it handles the weird 32/64bit
logic.  The ELF_PLATFORM bit I was commenting on was 32bit
only.
I'm not ready to implement any new functionality at the moment,
but what I heard suggested and was it may be reasonable to allow
machine to be modified on a per uts namespace basis.  If that
kind of thing is ever to happen ELF_PLATFORM needs to be per
uts on x86.  Actually allowing modification of machine is
an entirely different conversation.
