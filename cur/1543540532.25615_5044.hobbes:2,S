Sorry to interrupt, but unless you take a careful look you just can't
know if gcc or the kernel is/are to blame. In this case, there are
indications that (again!) it is the kernel code making unwarranted
assumptions about gcc's optimizations.
In any case, it has to be checked: Someday the current unstable gcc _will_
be the released version. Then what? Tell people to use the old, severely
broken 2.7.2.3 again?
