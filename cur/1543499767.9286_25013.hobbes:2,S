Built. Big fat one too. Works fine it seems. 1 day of slopping about
invested.
No NeXT port. No clue about Objective-C as a language.
Why?  	A: Why not?
  	B: I'm interested in what is a minimal complete Linux-based OS.
My definition of complete is, can maintain and update and add to itself
from source. That means a compiler. That also means it's a Linux/GNU or
whatever you prefer. In the interest of smallness, I don't currently keep
cc1plus or cc1obj around. In 2.7.2.3 the hit for adding Objective-C is
160k or so and slowing the compiler down by 2, and a few easy kernel
tweaks.
	In other words, for a 2x slowdown of the compiler and some minor
kernel tweaks my compiler gets 160k larger and I have something
disconcerting to say to the OOP weenies without mentioning Forth. I may
not go that way, but I am glad to know that's an option. That the kernel
is so close to already supporting Objective-C is a side-effect from my
point of view.
