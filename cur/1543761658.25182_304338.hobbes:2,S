There is a conflict. Thanks for pointing that out.
Both the obsolete __setup() parameter code and the module parameter
code in kernel/params.c are limited to a single matching parameter.
The first matching parameter will be used, and non-early obsoleted
parameters are overridden by module parameter code. If I understand
the code correctly that is. =)
Maybe it is possible to (mis)use early_param instead of __setup and
let these parameters become "high priority" parameters that only are
parsed by do_early_param()...?
