This is an open design problem. Going through the xattr interface is too slow 
for the nfs_permission_mode hack (which if enabled masks off permissions 
before sending them to old clients to be on the safe side). On the other 
hand, always going through the inode operations is also quirky as we would 
need to dispatch xattr names and decode values both in the VFS and in the FS. 
A clean solution to this would be very welcome.

They will once permission() also takes dentries. Before that they can't.
