Actually, what I was thinking is that if you use the swsusp infrastructure to 
suspend all processes, all dma, quiesce the heck out of the devices, and 
_then_ try to move the kernel...  Well, you at least have a much more 
controlled problem.  Yeah, it's pretty darn intrusive, but if you're doing 
"suspend to ram" perhaps the downtime could be only 5 or 10 seconds...
I don't know how much of the problem that leaves unsolved, though.
