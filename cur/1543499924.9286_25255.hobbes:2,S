I'm not comparign a 4kB filesystem to a 1kB filesystem, Stephen.
I'm comparing the new code to the old code (with a 4kB filesystem in both
cases).
What I'm saying is that the new code is so much better than the old code
that I want to get numbers from it - before I have NUMBERS I don't intend
to do anything at all.
