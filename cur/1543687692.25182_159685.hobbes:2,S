selinux/hooks.c won't build on ia64.
2.6.0-test3 + ia64 patch or 2.6.0-test4.
security/selinux/hooks.c: In function `selinux_file_fcntl':
security/selinux/hooks.c:2032: error: `F_GETLK64' undeclared (first use in
this function) security/selinux/hooks.c:2033: error: `F_SETLK64' undeclared
(first use in this function) security/selinux/hooks.c:2034: error:
`F_SETLKW64' undeclared (first use in this function)
The __64 versions of these are defined in include/asm-ia64/compat.h. I don't
see a good way to #include asm/compat.h, nor is it available for all
processor architectures.
