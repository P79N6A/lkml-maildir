I've stuck an updated keyutils tarball and SRPM on:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/keyutils/keyutils-0.3-2.tar.bz2
 
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/keyutils/keyutils-0.3-2.src.rpm
For those who want to play with the new facilities.
Alexander Zangerl: I've incorporated my take on your patch by which
/sbin/request-key can be made to dangle a slave program at the ends of a pair
of pipes to do the work. The callout_info is passed to stdin and the payload
data retrieved via stdout. You configure it by sticking a '|' symbol in front
of the program name in /etc/request-key.conf. Can you test it please. That bit
compiles, but I haven't had time to test it yet, so it may not work.
