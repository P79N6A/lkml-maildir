Side effect really, not intentional. 'as' always registered itself with
the elevator core as "anticipatory", the logic to match elevator=foo
string to scheduler used to be completely seperate prior to the addition
of online switchable elevators. So when those two were tied together,
the "as" disappeared. I guess the right thing to do at that time was to
rename "anticipatory", but that didn't happen...
