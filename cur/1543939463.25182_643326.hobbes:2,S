My point was about "obvious" errors, and I really think that one
or two configuration will found most of these, doing in an
automatic way, and without delay the process.
Anyway more test are surely better.
BTW, IIRC there are already few "testing farms" which tests
automatically  a lot of environment and configuration (IIRC,
also run time tests).

few hours, but a lot of changeset will broke bisect (few doc tell
us how to continue bisecting on compile errors).
But I agree with you.

As usual, "One level more indirections" ;-) . Along a spamfilter,
we (or Linus) need a patch filter.

PS: I don't want to be pessimistic. I only want to raise the problem,
to see if it is possible to improve testing environment without
affecting the development of Linux.
