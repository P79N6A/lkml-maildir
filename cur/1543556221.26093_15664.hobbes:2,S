Even if the lowlevel driver handles the error case, it would still
make more sense to stick with the normal kernel practise of -ERROR,
and 0 for success.  Then, if in the future we can do something with the
error codes, at least we don't have to change the interface yet again.
Also, it is a bit confusing, because the lvm (and md, I suppose) driver
returned "0" for success in 2.2, so now you need to special-case the
return value depending on kernel version, if you want to keep the same
code for 2.2 and 2.4.
Cheers, Andreas
