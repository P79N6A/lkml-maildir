There are drivers that do it, for a variety of reasons.

Exactly :) This would imply busses/subsystems could never be unloadable
modules.

zfcp comes to mind. They register some units in zfcp_aux.c, which don't
have anything to do with the bus the zfcp adapter is on (the ccw bus).
Currently, that is "solved" by disallowing zfcp module unloading.
