I think this change has the potential to significantly increase the hold
time of tvec_base_t.lock.  Quite a lot of code has been moved inside that
lock, but most worrisome is that hrtimer_get_next_event() is also now
inside it.
What workloads is this change likely to impact, and how can we set about
verifying that we aren't introducing a problem?
Was that (unchangelogged) locking change even needed?  If so, why?
