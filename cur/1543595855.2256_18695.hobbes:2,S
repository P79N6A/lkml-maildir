For NICs at least, there's already a generic way... :)
Sigh, in my technically correct heart I know putting driver versions in
dmesg is probably not the best thing, but it makes support -so- -much-
easier that I am not inclined to change the existing code.
FWIW, all the NIC drivers I mess with (most originated from Becker)
should print out:
<one line version>
eth0: short product name, base addr, MAC addr, irq
eth1: ...
eth2: ...
I grant you there are tons of exceptions even in NIC drivers, but that
is the goal I am striving for.  One line version, plus one line per
registered netif.
FWIW I find usb and parport messages exceptionally verbose, but some of
that is probably related to KERN_DEBUG being set in the bootloader or
kernel/printk.c or somewhere...
