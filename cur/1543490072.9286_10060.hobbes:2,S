Subject: Stuck shift key on one virtual console (2.0.36)

Somehow when I was editing with Emacs this morning, the shift key on
my first virtual console became `stuck'.  Now, when I try to use shift
on that console, the keypress is ignored, and certain other keys are
ignored too.  For instance, if I change vt to that console, I can't
switch away with Alt+Fn.
All the other vts behave normally.
I'm using a mechanical switchbox for keyboard and monitor switching,
so I switched to another machine and ssh'd in and ran chvt to switch
away.  Then I killed the emacs and bash processes running on the rogue
vt, dropping back to the login prompt there.  But I can't log in since
I can't type any shifted characters.
Suggestions?  Is this something I did wrong or is it a bug somewhere?
I tried loadkeys just in case, but it didn't change the behavior.
Thanks in advance,
Ben.
