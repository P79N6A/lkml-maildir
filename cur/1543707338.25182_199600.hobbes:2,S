This is because scripts differentiating between upper and lower case are
rare exceptions in the world.
Unfortunately, commonly used exceptions, and still locale dependent.
Having a samba-helper kernel module that would contain this table (I am
confident that it's only a single table in existing versions of windows,
but maybe they improve that in future versions) could solve this problem.
I still wonder wether it ever can be made efficient, though.
