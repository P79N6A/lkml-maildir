Surely, it can. You just have to tell the compiler that it's not
properly aligned, and it'll emit code to cope. Hence the suggestion that
you use 'unsigned long long __attribute__((aligned(BYTES_PER_WORD))'.
But it's probably better just to make sure it remains aligned; you're
right.

Really? Other than the alignment of the second redzone, what's wrong?
Remember that the 'user word' is still not necessarily 64-bit. And in
fact I suspect that's what is causing the problem -- your object _size_
will be aligned to 8 bytes, including the user word, and then we look
for the second redzone word 12 bytes before the end of the object.
Does this fix it?
