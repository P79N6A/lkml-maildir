Subject: Query on remap_pfn_range compatibility

I read the messages on lkml from September 2004 about the introduction of
remap_pfn_range and have a question related to coding for it. What do you
recommend for driver coding to be compatible with these functions
(remap_page_range, remap_pfn_range)?
For example, I see at least two (or three) combination I need to address:
 - 2.4 (with remap_page_range) OR 2.6.x (with remap_page_range)
 - 2.6.x-mm (with remap_pfn_range)
Is there some symbol or #ifdef value I can depend on to determine which
function I should be calling (and the value to pass in)?
Thanks.
