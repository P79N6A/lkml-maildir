Yes. 
For example, if the only different access speeds you have were "on the local
node" vs "on another node", and access times to all *other* nodes were the
same, you'd have 2 levels.
If you have "on the local node" (10 ns) vs "on any node 1 hop away" (100ns), 
"on any node 2 hops away" (110ns), that'd be 3 levels. (latency numbers picked
out of my portable random number generator ;-) ).
If the latencies on a 4 level system turn out to be 10,100,101,102  then it's only
going to be worth defining 2 levels. If they turn out to be 10,100,1000, 10000,
then it'll (probably) be worth doing 4 ....
