Well I haven't really changed the code at all apart from the bits
to do with module loading and parsing the device name for resume.
What I've done is:
* Split swsusp.c into swsusp-core.c and the rest based on whether it
is called by do_magic() or not.
* Added EXPORTs for the symbols needed by what's left of swsusp.
* Added module parameter parsing.
The renames are part of the second step as the symbols
resume_device/suspend_name/resume_Name were too generic.

The point of this is to allow inclusion in distribution kernels where
block devices are built as modules.
As a side-effect it also allows you to resume from devices that couldn't
be done before due to the need for user-space setup.  Examples are LVM
and NBD.

Is that really necessary if the user-space caller ensures that all
disk accesses are shut down? After all the loading for resume will
occur in the initrd before any disk activity has occured.
