Let me jump in here. Short info: Toshiba MK2003GAH 1.8" 20GB 
PATA harddisk, in a Sony Vaio U3 (x86, gray-blue PhoenixBIOS).
If idle for more than 5 secs, unloads. Even when not inside any OS, 
which really sets me off.
    So I wrote a quick workaround hack for Linux, 
http://tinyurl.com/y3qs6g
It reads a predefined amount of bytes (just as much to not cause 
slowdown yet still cause it to not unload) from the disk at fixed 
intervals.

Parking heads is worse than a seek - it takes more time to reload it 
than to seek to the other side.
