We've been here before.  I argued the userspace interface was broken to
require this looping, Linus said it was fine, Ingo said "userspace will
assume < 1024 cpus" and if we get more than that we'll need a new
interface, and that's what glibc does today with its cpu_set_t.
Shades of select-style pain, but it's not likely to change in the near
future.
Note also that saying "Schedule me on CPU 1 and 999" 'succeeds' at the
moment.
Yes, NR_CPUS needs to get to userspace somehow sanely if we want to fix
this in general.
Rusty.
