OK, I've finally found out why agpgart locks up the machine upon
resuming from swsusp/pmdisk.
The reason is that the gatt table is remapped with ioremap_nocache,
which on i386 machines capable of PSE will result in 4M pages being
split.
When swsusp/pmdisk copies the pages back, the top page table is
written before the entries that it points to are filled in.
Depending on whether the second-level table lies before or after
the 4M-page in question, this will result in a page fault.
A simple solution is to copy the pages in reverse.  This way the
top page table is filled in last which should resolve this particular
issue.  The following patch does exactly that and fixes the problem
for me.
Cheers,
