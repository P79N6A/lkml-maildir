I assumed that the posted results were apples and apples. That may not be
the case. If this was one kernel tuned for dbench and one for something
else, then the information content is pretty low, to me at least. But if
it is both tuned or both stock, then I would hope 2.5 would be better. If
the text said that and I read past it, I apologise.

I confess to being a kernel junkie when I have the time, I have run into
the limitation of 19 boot stanzas in LILO :-( I have a case statement in
rc.local to tune -aa VM, stock, and -ac rmap a little differently, since
this machine is fairly fast and has bigish memory (2GB this week) and
getting several ISO images in RAM and then having bdflush kick them out is
bad. Looking forward to the io scheduler.
I like to see 2.4.19 vs. 2.5.{29+} both tuned and untuned, but I have no
days off in the next ten. By then there will be more new stuff, but the
fast machine will be several area codes away, perhaps one of the people
who like to do benchmarks might be too curious to wait.
