       "If  the name of the device node that has been speci■
       fied on such a system refers to exactly one SCSI device, a shorthand in
       the form dev= devicename:@ or dev= devicename:@,lun may be used instead
       of dev= devicename:scsibus,target,lun."
So @ is equal to 0,0,0 or 0,0?
Threads indicated that every device under linux is "exactly one SCSI device",
which is why I was asking for this behind-the-scenes translation of /dev/hdc
into /dev/hdc:@.

I think mount uses this syntax (`mount /dev/acd0 /mnt`).
