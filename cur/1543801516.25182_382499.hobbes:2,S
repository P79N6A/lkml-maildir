Subject: [PATCH] lib: Fix bug in int_sqrt() for 64 bit longs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The implementation of int_sqrt() assumes that longs have 32 bits.  On 
systems that have 64 bit longs this will result in gross errors when the 
argument to the function is greater than 2^32 - 1 on such systems. I 
doubt whether any such use is currently made of int_sqrt() but the 
attached patch fixes the problem anyway.
