That makes sense, at least for anything that can be described as an

And these will remain macros as well.  Without type checking there

If that statement was meant to be generic, it failed for me.  Now, I
happen to be used to one thing and you are used to another, so a large
part of that may only be habit.  Still, I have have thought about what
I'm doing and believe to have a slightly more objective reason (better
grouping).

If that were true, why are function and line included in BUG() then?
And after looking up BUG(), why is the loglevel missing from every
printk in it?  Looks like a "naked" printk is far from uncommon.  Plus,
in my testing, something magically added a default (<4>) loglevel to
every printk.
This leaves me a bit puzzled and wondering whether I should change each
and every printk in my code.  After killing the bogus ones, of course.

Does anyone have a header suggestion?  fs.h is the obvious one, although

Hey, I _do_ use it.  But only for logfs_*_ops.  So clearly I did it once
and then copied one from another.

Anyone living in any doubt that a function declaration in a header is
not meant to be global has my deepest sympathy.  I'll kill the existing
"extern"s.

But that is pointless.  In particular the "for now" part is pointless.
"For now" is exactly what I have already.  And the less I waste my time
with cosmetics the sooner I can spend time to fix it "for good".

#define max_t(type,x,y) \
	({ type __x = (x); type __y = (y); __x > __y ? __x: __y; })
Both x and y get implicitly cast to type.  Whereas max has the much
stronger
        (void) (&_x == &_y);            \
Even with a single cast, at least one parameter receives strong type
checking, which in C exists only for pointers but not for any integer
types.

You have to come up with a better reason than your personal preference.
In particular when your suggestion is to remove useful documentation.

What was the context again?  Oh, yes, comments.  Hmm.
	/* fairly short one-line comment; is just barely within 80 columns */
	/*
	 * slighly longer two-line comment; would be just barely over 80
	 * columns
	 */
I think it is unfortunate that the second comment is just 6 characters
longer and yet has to fill four lines instead of one.  Oh well,
consistency wins.

That _does_ look better.  Consider me convinced.

Can do.
Just like for any other filesystem, fuzzing an image will uncover many
bugs.  More than in other filesystems simply because LogFS is younger.
The only exceptions are JFFS2 and ZFS - and even those only if the
attacker^Wresearcher didn't bother to recalculate checksums after
fuzzing.
Hardly material for 8 o'clock news.

Then it should be generically implemented and commented somewhere once,
so that other filesystems can just use the functionality.
I haven't closely followed Nick Piggin's work, but it could be entirely
possible that some of his patches make this obsolete.  Might be a bad
time for such a cleanup.

Why do you want to see this code gone?  Unlike many of the #if 0 Adrian
added, this code has a maintainer that cares about it.  Surely there
must be better candidates for removal.

Then please ask specific questions.  My abilities to guess what others
consider obvious are quite limited.  Doubly so because I am more
familiar with many basic (to LogFS) concepts than any potential reader.
So familiar in fact, I usually don't even notice.

That implies I would also do this without actually wanting to.  Or maybe
not me but some other kernel hackers.  Is that realistic?  Have such

Helpful to whom?  If you volunteered to do this testing, I will gladly
change the code to your liking.  If, as expected, I will do this work
then I actually like it as it is "for now". :)

Ah, yes.  One day I should go through all my patches, interdiff them and
see how many lines I actually wrote.  There has been a huge amount of
churn and this is not the first case where I missed an obvious cleanup
after some other code change.

Yup.  I'm converted.

Sometimes I get this feeling that none of my code is obvious.  Maybe I
should add a file giving a rough design overview and what part of the
design each file is supposed to deal with.

Does not seem to be documented either.  Not sure if I can trust every
driver on it.  But I should be able to trust my own code, which is

Finding it in the logs when looking for it is definitely not a problem.
What could be a problem is that people not looking for this could find
it in their logs.  So the fsck as a whole should be hidden behind a big
sign forbidding civilians and children to enter.  Or just moved to
userspace.
