Wrong.
If I get a patch in an attachment (other than a "Text/PLAIN" type
attachment with no mangling and that pretty much all mail readers and
all tools will see as a normal body), I simply WILL NOT apply it unless
I have strong reason to. I usually wont even bother looking at it,
unless I expected something special from the sender.
Really. Don't send patches as attachments.
