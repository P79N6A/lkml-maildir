The board supports up to 4 GB total (4 DIMM slots), DDR 400/333/266. I'm
normally using 2 * 512 MB DDR 400 on Single 128 bit mode. And the board's
been tested to support up to 4 of the modules that I have (
KVR400X64C25/512 ) shown at :

(GA-8SQ80
0%20Ultra2).htm
I tested both modules seperately just minutes ago, AND GET NO ERRORS on
either one. The errors occur when I have both in.
I've tried running them different speeds (e.g. 333), and it made no
difference in what Linux did (black screened after kernel load).

Hi,
I have a Gigabyte SINXP1394 motherboard, and 2 Kingston 512 MB DDR 400 (CL
2.5) RAM modules installed. Whenever I try to install any Linux
distribution, I always get a black screen after the kernel loads, when I
have dual channel enabled; If I take out 1 of the RAM modules (either one),
everything works as it should -- it's not a bad module (works perfectly
under Windows by the way). I can't disable dual channel without taking out
half of my RAM, and I really do not want to run with only half of it. Does
anyone have any idea how I can fix this problem, or is it something that
needs to be updated in the kernel?
Thanks for any info.
