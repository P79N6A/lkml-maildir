How much private ioctls do you need actually ? I assume that for sending raw
commands you use SG_IO already...
BTW it would be really nice if the various raid controller drivers could
come up with a joint common IOCTL api since it seems every raid controller
driver right now has a largely overlapping but yet different set of ioctls.
