Which is a problem because the kernel is GPL, that isnt GPL compatible
and until this was pointed out nobody has been going to print their blurb
in all the manuals - because after all it says GPL.
Licenses cannot be ignored. If I merge non GPL compliant code I'm doing to
the contributors to the kernel the very same thing people pirating windows
do to microsoft.

Doesnt work in modules. See previous twice repeated discussion. 
As Matthew has noted, we have a source of newer firmware, and because the
sparc's have this annoying firmware problem it is going to be appropriate
to add build in firmware as a config option (probably set with def_bool on
sparc..)
At the time a) I didnt realise the sparc setup was so anal, and b) I didnt
know about the firmware update.
