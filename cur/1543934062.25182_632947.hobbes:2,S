Ok, you are right, it was late and after some wine and I shouldn't have
been responding to email :)
I'll rework this, and send out a patch tonight or tomorrow when I get a
chance (am on the road right now).  We should only care about NULL being
returned here, that's the only "real" error.
And in thinking about it some more, I should go audit all the debugfs
callers to make sure they are doing something sane too, it shouldn't be
this complex at all...
