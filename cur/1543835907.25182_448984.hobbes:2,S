It think you mean ->writepage - reiser4 desn't implement ->writepages().
I assume you considered hooking into ->set_page_dirty() to do the
add-to-atom thing earlier on?
We'll merge mm-tracking-shared-dirty-pages.patch into 2.6.19-rc1, which
would make that approach considerably more successful, I expect. 
->set_page_dirty() is a bit awkward because it can be called under
spinlock.
Maybe comething could also be gained from the new
vm_operations_struct.page_mkwrite(), although that's less obvious...

That's not good.  The ability to properly support SELinux is likely to be
important.
