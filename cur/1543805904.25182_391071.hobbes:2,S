Hello all,
DIPC (Distributed IPC) makes the system V IPC's shared memories, semaphores, 
and messages work transparently over the network for easy data transfer 
among distributed applications.
A package containing an unfinished port of DIPC to 2.6 kernels 
(dipc-2.1-alpha1.tgz) can be found here: 
http://www.cs.uwindsor.ca/~kamran/downloads.html
 in the DIPC section.
The user-space tools and the kernel compile, but no tests have been done. 
Also, due to changes in 2.6 kernels, some of the code in DIPC's shm.c code 
has been commented out, so the shared memory won't work for now.
Any contribution in this effort is greatly appreciated.
