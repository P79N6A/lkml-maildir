Subject: [PATCH] PPC64 log firmware errors during boot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/17/311

Firmware can report errors at any time, and not atypically during boot.
However, these reports were being discarded until th rtasd comes up,
which occurs fairly late in the boot cycle.  As a result, firmware
errors during boot were being silently ignored.
