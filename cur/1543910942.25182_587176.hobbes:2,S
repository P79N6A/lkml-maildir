Actually yes, I did and am still considering to do that. Still I feel that there are a few things that need to be changed in the gcov-kernel code before it's suitable for inclusion into mainline (e.g. move from use of /proc to debugfs, use of seqfile mechanism instead of custom code). Part of that work has already been done by yyangcdl@cn.ibm.com and myself but we've stalled about half-way due to a lack of time.
Seeing that there seems to be some support for the idea, I'll try to come up with a patch for further discussion.
