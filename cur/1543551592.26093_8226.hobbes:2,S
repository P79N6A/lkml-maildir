If you can boot your system without hitting this problem (shouldn't be a
problem in your case...), you can also use the setpci tool to change these
values. That way, you don't have to patch your kernel. A simple script should
do the trick (see the following example). I tried it, it did not blow up my system. My box does fine without it, but this might help in your case.
