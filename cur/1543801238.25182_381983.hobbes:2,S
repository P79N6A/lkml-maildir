This sentence makes this in my mind: real people = lazy people. The error 
codes are documented well. Also, aplay in the alsa-utils package has
good error recovery code including test pcm.c utility in alsa-lib.

Well, it's better to create only "fast parameter setup" and "default error 
recovery" functions.

While "official" examples exists for a long time. Also, we already noted 
that we are not best documentation writers, but everytime when we ask for 
help we hear nothing from other people.
