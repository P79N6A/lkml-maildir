Cool stuff!  However, it's not working (2.6.20.6):
	Core dump to |/home/caker/bin/dumper.pl.4442 pipe failed
even though...
	# cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid
	0
	# cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
	|/home/caker/bin/dumper.pl
Looking at the code, it seems to me that format_corename() is appending 
.pid, regardless if !core_uses_pid and corename[0]=='|', in which case 
it creates an invalid path for call_usermodehelper_pipe().
Bug in the code, or bug in my methods?
