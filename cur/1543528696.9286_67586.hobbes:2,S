Well, though Linus used to reply my email concerning this Toshiba kbd
patch, after I sent to him the latest version he ceased to reply.
Since this was in December, I think, and Transmeta was about to
release it's processor in January, probably he was very busy.  I tried
to send it a couple of times more, didn't got any answers, probably he
is busy, or this patch is not of such a great interest.  Or, maybe my
new (strange) email setup generates messages that are filtered out by
whatever filters he has installed.  Anyway, no problem, I didn't
push it because it's a specific hardware problem and it would be
better to just forget about it than to make it a patch into the
kernel.
However, for those interested, here is the message that I tried a few
times to get through to Linus.  If you cannot get it to work, please
send me the drivers/char/pc_keyb.c file you are using and I'll send
you the patched file back.  I have a patch for 2.3.x, but I am sure x
is too small to be of any use...
Regards,
Andrei

Hi Linus,
Sorry to bother you, just wondering if my kbd patch is going to find
its way into the kernel or not.  I hope you received the latest
version (though I suspect a problem somewhere, it was CCed on
linux-kernel, nobody answered - I am not a subscriber, therefore there
might have been replies to the list only, but...).
I can tell you that this patch helps a lot: not only it removes
glitches, but it also evens the kbd repeat delay, which is in the
range 160-250 on my laptop and it seems that on other kbds as well.
It can be thought off as a pre-handler, maybe taking care of other
problems (if any) in the future.
I have included it in this message, for your convenience, not as a
patch, because I am really not fully aware of how to find the latest
source tree (CVS, perhaps?) and I saw that he latest 2.3. version has
some rearrangements in that area of pc_keyb.c.
The fix consist of a function: 'handle_delay', which should be called
like this:
	handle_delay(scancode);
instead of (replacing) the call to handle_scancode in pc_keyb.c,
wherever this may be in the current version:
        handle_scancode(scancode, !(scancode & 0x80));
Thanks,
Andrei
