Manu, have you actually looked at the patch?  It seems like you are just
rejecting everything that has anything to do with dst out of hand.
Can you point to any line of code there, and say what it breaks or what it
will make impossible?

Again, did you actually look at the patch?  I never so much as used the
word frontend to describe the dst.  I didn't change the operation of the
dst in any way.  I didn't move it to a new place in the framework.
The bt8xx driver talks to the dst module via the dvb_frontend object, my
patch has nothing to do with this.  It is a simple patch for simple
programming issues and nothing to do with these larger issues you bring up.

Is the problem that there is a bug in my patch?  Or is your problem that I
was rude in submitting any patch at all that had anything to do with your
code?  Do you feel that this part of the Linux kernel is owned by you, and
that no one else should be permitted to have anything to do with it?

This is not correct.  The dvb_attach() system has no assumption that it will
be used for a front-end device.  There are already users which are not
front-ends, such as tuners or lnb supply control chips, and yes, dst, which
will all know very well is not a frontend.
It also has nothing do with the i2c.  The attached device could be connected
in any way.  I plan to add dvb_attach() support for the cx88 secondary i2c bus
driver (aka vp3054), and that isn't even a different chip.

The dst is already using dvb_attach()!  I'm not changing that at all.

Can one become a maintainer just be declaring ones self to be so?  Or is there
an expectation that a maintainer will in fact, maintain.  That is to say,
address concerns in a timely fashion, review patches and work in good faith to
resolve problems with said patches.

So as maintainer you are declaring that no changes of any kind are permitted?
That is to say, the code should become frozen, un-fixed and un-updated, in
other words, _unmaintained_.
How can you have it both ways, that you are the maintainer and that it should
be unmaintained?
