It's not the lack of defragmentation but due bad allocation of memory.
Just to make an example look at the inode cache. It uses a _bad_ way to
alloc memory. That's the _best_ way to generate _persistent_ fragmentation
all over the place.
And btw I think that for vmlloced areas would be possible to defrag them
at runtime, but for normal __get_free_pages memory it's not possible, it's
the allocation in first place that has to be smart to avoid fragmentation
according to me.
