I have written a driver for a pci board that uses interrupts.  I install 
the shared handler with a unique dev_id, or at least it should be unique 
as it is the address of my driver's internal data struct for that card. 
 I get not only my interrupts, but also the interrupts of the shared 
device, namely the network card.  Is this what I should expect?  If I 
get a notification for the network card, why is the dev_id the same as 
what I passed?  If I didn't have an interrupt pending bit on my 
hardware, how would I distinguish between the interrupts?
TIA
