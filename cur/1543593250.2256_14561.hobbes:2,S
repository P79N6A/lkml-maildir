For PL-2301/2302 devices, "ifconfig up" is mostly just posting a bulk read.
True with both "usbnet" and its (now obsolete) predecessor drivers "plusb"
and (for different devices) "net1080".
Laplink-style cables can often support another mode (poll via USB "interrupts",
and then issue reads only when data is available) but not every device can work
that way (like, I seem to recall, an iPaq PDA).  And that'd increase the latency
per packet by a couple milliseconds, even when it's possible.

This problem is UHCI-specific, not USB-generic, yes?
Doesn't happen with OHCI?
