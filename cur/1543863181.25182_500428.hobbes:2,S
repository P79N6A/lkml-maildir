It looks like what you're getting is an actual NCQ write timing out. 
That makes the bisect result not very interesting since obviously it 
wouldn't have issued any NCQ writes before NCQ support was implemented. 
Seeing as how it's also an entirely different driver I imagine it's a 
different problem than what I've been looking at.
Maybe that drive just has some issues with NCQ? I would be surprised at 
that with a Seagate though..
