Just hit poweron button? Maybe you can download & install
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/vmware/vmware-any-any-update45.tar.gz
 before,
but there is no need for it unless you are using prebuilt RedHat's
kernels which are built with -mregparm=3... (and update45 does not
contain Christopher's patch for -mm4 yet).
BTW, anybody knows how to explain to gcc that inline assembly uses
push & pop, and so $esp relative addressing is not going to work very
well?
