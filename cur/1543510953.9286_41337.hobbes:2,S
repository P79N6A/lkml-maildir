   I don't think so.
   Look at what is printed...
OK, I assumed Mike had converted the sector number back into a block
number, but obviously, without his actually sending actual data, this
may have been a bad assumption. 
The fact remains that the likeliest cause for this sort of thing is
garbage read from a inode table or an indirect metadata block, and that
to date this is usually caused by hardware problems.....
