The only problem I see with this -- and its a minor problem -- is that 
some patches that belong in the 2.6.X.Y tree go straight to you/Andrew, 
rather than to $sucker.
It's perfectly workable from a BK standpoint to do
	-> linux-2.6 commit
	-> cpcset into linux-2.6.X.Y [see Documentation/BK-usage/cpcset]
	-> pull from linux-2.6.X.Y into linux-2.6 [dups cset, but no
	   real code change]
but that causes dups in the BK changelog and history.  Not a big deal, 
though, just a minor technical nit.
