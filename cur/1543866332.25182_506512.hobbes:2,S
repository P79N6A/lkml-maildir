I see. But sorry, I can't see where is preventing it... Finally, I
think we do the following on second write(2).
This is write, so create == 1, and ->lock_type == DIO_LOCKING,
and dio->block_in_file > ->i_size, so DIO callback fat_get_block() with
create == 1.
Then fat_get_block() seems to allocate block without fill hole,
because it can't know caller is prepre_write or not...
Well, anyway I'll test it on weekend. Thanks.
-> blockdev_direct_IO()
  -> direct_io_worker()
    -> do_direct_IO()
      -> get_more_blocks()
		create = dio->rw & WRITE;
		if (dio->lock_type == DIO_LOCKING) {
			if (dio->block_in_file < (i_size_read(dio->inode) >>
							dio->blkbits))
				create = 0;
		} else if (dio->lock_type == DIO_NO_LOCKING) {
			create = 0;
		}
