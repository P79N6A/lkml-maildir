What will this code do at the (increasingly common) misconfigured sites
- many places (hotels, airports, etc) return a MTU of 64... to which the
DHCP3 client faithfully attempts to set, only to receive:
	SIOCSIFMTU: Invalid argument
And is one of the easiest issues I've had during my travels - thankfully
I don't do it all that often; trying to tell the helpdesk folk that
their DHCP server is handing out bogus DNS servers, MTU, even networks
is an exercise in futility.
