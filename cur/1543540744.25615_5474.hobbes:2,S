     Is it good that dirty superblocks can take so long before they get
   written out?
     What is the correct fix?
Surprisingly you don't even mention as a possible correct fix the one
hinted at by your first question :-)
I can't see any real benefit to the different flushtime settings for
sb vs. non-sb dirty buffers.  Just use the same value for both types,
I doubt it really matters at all.
