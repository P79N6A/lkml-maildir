ok... then '20'???  IE it would seem that that might be 1/4th using 
the same 'what number is next in this series?'  :)  That's not bad,
but what about the one last case of '0%'???  IE I want to run 
something that is going to take days to run, but I don't want it to
slow down my compiles at all, and I don't want it to interfere with
Crafty when it is playing on a chess server.  I just want this 
'ultra-low-priority' job to run when one or more cpus are completely
idle...

it's not something that is critical, just something that would give us
all 'more control.'  I'm in no rush, but am willing to test most anything
(if nothing else, I've become quite adept at applying patches, building
kernels and rebooting.  :)  )
