Subject: [PATCH] Missing include in swap.h for some architectures
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings All,
This flaw broke kernel builds configured with SWAP=n on some architectures,
particularly alpha and ia64.  Since i386 managed to include pagemap.h
indirectly, this did not crop up there.  See log for details.
This applies to linux-2.5 BK as of 0400 UTC 10/20/2003 and passes all kinds of
ridiculous compile tests, probably including (allyesconfig - broken stuff) on
sparc, sparc64, ia64, alpha, and i386.  Don't know about VAX...
One could place this include within the #ifdef'ed block that contains the
relevant function uses, but that's not generally within the style of this file
or most others, per my recollection.
I didn't know who takes things like this, so if anyone would like to pick this
up, please do so.  Otherwise, I will send it to Linus after a few days.

# --------------------------------------------
# 03/10/16	noah@caltech.edu	1.1368
# The linux/swap.h header uses the page_cache_release and release_pages
# functions declared in linux/pagemap.h when CONFIG_SWAP is disabled.  Add
# an include of linux/pagemap.h so swap.h finds those declarations on
# architectures that don't include pagemap.h indirectly.
