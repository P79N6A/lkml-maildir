First of all, let me say I really like what I've seen so far.  The file
descriptor paradigm seems really elegant to me.

As previously discussed, I think this should be a filesystem rather than
a system call.  There are a couple of advantages to doing it that way, IMO:
- Strings, rather than numbers, which means fewer constraints across
  architectures.
- The events available can be exported in the filesystem itself (via
  readdir) rather than via sysfs.
- Compatibility with existing tools, esp. non-C tools.
I'm thinking of something like:
/dev/perfctr/3/cache_misses/all/simple/300
i.e. /dev/perfctr/<cpu>/<event>/<pid>/<type>/<period>.  I am putting
<cpu> ahead of <event> in the hierarchy, so a readdir() on the <cpu>
directory can show the events available by name on that CPU.  Raw
hardware events can be accessed by something like
/dev/perfctr/<cpu>/0x4064/...
