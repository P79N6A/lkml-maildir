I found I have a similar problem with the cpia driver. With cpia support
built into the kernel, the last thing I got was
usb.c: Registered new driver cpia
and the system stopped. Note that no USB initialisation messages
appeared prior
to the final line. This occurred with and without the camera (my only
USB
device) connected.
Building the cpia support as modules and modprobing them in after the
system
has booted seems to work without any problem.
