Could be.  On my system, the X server runs for about 15 seconds to
five minutes before it wedges up and locks up.  This is why it took me
a while before I finally figured out that the way to reliably
reproduce the problem was to do a suspend/resume.  So it's not
*identical* to the report, but its really close....
When I have more time I'll try to find some actual bisection points
that actually will successfully boot on the X61s laptop, and not die
within 6-8 seconds of the kernel loading.....
