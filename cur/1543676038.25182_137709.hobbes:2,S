NUMA systems don't have any benefits (well other than engineering 
considerations like practicality of construction). From a software
perspective NUMA is simply a question of making the loss as little
as possible.
There are patches to do more NUMA aware scheduling which help a bit
as well as to do things like replicate the kernel code to each node.
