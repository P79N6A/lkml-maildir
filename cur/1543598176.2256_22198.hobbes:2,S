Because of other reasons i'm back to 2.2.19
/proc/mtrr from 2.2.19 show this
-- /proc/mtrr --
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x40000000 (1024MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1
reg02: base=0x60000000 (1536MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1
reg03: base=0x70000000 (1792MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
reg04: base=0x78000000 (1920MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1
reg05: base=0x7c000000 (1984MB), size=  32MB: write-back, count=1
-- end --
(32MB "missing". Seems like Linux uses these "missing" MBs.)
For the 2.4.X-Kernel i had switched off the MTRR-Kernel-Option!
Maybe i should try it another time with MTRR-Support switched on. 
Or i should use "mem=2016M".

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as 
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
