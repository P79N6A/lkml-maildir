I think you just don't like Microsoft. It is very bad to let your
hatred of Microsoft cloud your judgement.
NT has an ACL model that can emulate the Netware and POSIX ones.
It is good even before you consider smbfs, Samba, NTFS, and Wine.
Roughly: the read-write-execute permissions are broken down into
six basix permissions and some object-specific (file, dir, etc.)
permissions. Access may be explicitly granted or denied. As far
as I remember (don't make me boot NT), denial is applied last.
You can mark files for auditing success or failure of various
permission bits. Inheritance can apply to files, directories,
both, or neither. Inheritance can be one-time-only.
Here is a real need that NT can satisfy:
Wietse Venema (mail system author) wants:
% ACLs that allow me to specify: this maildrop directory has file
% create permission for every user; this maildrop file has read and
% delete permission for the mail system.
Stephan Zegherd <inverter@nbs.it> seems to be doing ACL support for NTFS.
Anyone doing ext2 should consider working with the NTFS people.

Security means more than ACL support. Microsoft screwed up some of
the authentication. Also, Netware is a business tradition.
