(I'd be asking the same question in that case, but don't worry about it!)

Phew, thanks, please drop that hunk.

No great meaning, hence "BOGO".  I put that in when hpa (IIRC) found
tmpfs directory size 0 didn't suit some apps.  I thought it would be
nice to have a size which indicates the current number of entries
(which your 1 would do), looks plausible (for short filenames),
and easy to make sense of in an "ls -l".  Bogus, yes; but I'd
resist changing it after all this time, without very good reason.
