I tested if I can boot with 2.2.0-pre4 without and with your patch.
Stil don't boot after detecting drives it is repeating...

until I don't press reset button :(
BUT I also found NEW WORKAROUND :)
it works like this:
I turn ON computer and I FIRST boot in 2.0.36 and
then I reboot in 2.2.0-pre4 and it boot fine !!!
I can then (re)boot fine in 2.2.0-pre4
UNTIL I do not turn OFF my computer
That is very strange and I did one more test
I turn off my computer ; and back turned on
boot in 2.0.36 ctrl+alt+del then del ( to enter bios setup )
then I disconected power  from my cdrom only (on live ; I know it is dangerous )
after 30 minutes I reconected power back to cd rom
went out of bios setup and I boot fine in 2.2.0-pre4.
Now I do not think that problem is with cdrom any more,
so I now have reasonable doubt that the problem
is somewhere in motherboard chipset initialization :(
With my old goldstar 816B I din't and I don't have this problem
and it shows only with my udma asus 340 and my VX board .
Normal booting looks like this:
2.0.36
