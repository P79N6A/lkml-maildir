That has been the idea. Maybe if you have better way to 'communicate'
with David Singleton (oppoint) since he refuses to be drawn into the
merge discussions.

Yes, it is a good first step. Please comment on the PowerOP patches to
see if there is something in the OP notion that is missing in your
opinion.

I believe the PowerOP patches from Eugeny and Matt do not touch
suspend-resume issues and make the kernel-userspace interface to define
OP as an optional patch.
Oppoing patches on the other hand touch those issues.
