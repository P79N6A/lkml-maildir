Sounds fine, once i get some working code i'll send it to you for
inclusion/testing/whatever...if anyone has one of these CPU's and wants to
test some stuff out, let me know by private email and we'll work something
out.

alright, i'll see what i can find..

I wish i could, but it's quite ambiguous.. from the C6 Processor Data Book
(paraphrased from chart, p A-13): 
Attribute bit 0 : Enables store combining on non-stack non-string writes
Attribute bit 1 : enables store combining on string instruction writes
   "      bit 2 : enables store combining on stack instruction writes
	bits 3+4: write order strategy for memory region: Strog/weak
ordered..
but i have not found anywhere where they define "string" or
"stack"...howver, i'm new to reading these things so i thought maybe
someone here could shed some light on it...(for tests, i just turned 0,1,
and 2 on)
i'm also working under the (what i consider to be logical) assumption that
"store-combining" is "write-combining" from ythe PPro MTRR code.

appearently, you can tune the winchip's MCR's to not change the order of
writes...i'm actually rather impressed, there are like 8-10 different bits
you can set to tune the behavior of a given range, even if that does make
it a lot more confusing to program ;)

couldn't tell ya without going to Matrox, although this is a Mystique,
which appearently has hardware 3d support (a pleasent surprise when i
picked it up for 20$), maybe this range has something to do with that?
Xfree doesn't even report it..
