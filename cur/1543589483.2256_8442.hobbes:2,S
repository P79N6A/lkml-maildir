Basically.  It's weird because we could change tcp_sendmsg() to grab a
"little bit" of space in skb->data after the TCP headers area, but
that would screw all the memory allocation advantages carving up pages
gives us.
TCP used to be really rough on the memory subsystem, and in particular
going to a page carving scheme helped a lot in this area.

Tulip I think falls into this category, I could be wrong.  It has two
buffer pointers in the RX descriptor, but one might be able to chain
them.
Alexey added SG support to Tulip at some point, and I can probably dig
up the patch.  It doesn't do hw csumming, though.
