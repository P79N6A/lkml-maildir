Doing this (ie omitting stuff like all spinlocks, accounting etc code)
would be fairly easy (by intelligently linking at load time), and yes,
the price would be in register allocation. But what about data
structures?.. Either you'd have to leave them alone, in which  case the
"generic" kernel would eg be faster on UP than on MP, but would still
not be as efficient as a dedicated UP one; or you could fix up all
references, but then this becomes much too complicated. At that point
I'd prefer to simply have a two+ stage boot process where the final
kernel is recompiled (possibly from some kind of precompiled form to
speed this up) to match the hardware. Or you could have all possible
versions of the code prebuilt and link only the required objects on boot.
IOW, making a generic kernel a bit more efficient when certain
features aren't needed is possible, but the price isn't only worse
register allcation. (yep, some things can be done at runtime, but the
only feature from the above list i can see this making sense for is
bypassing the rt layer when it's not in use)
