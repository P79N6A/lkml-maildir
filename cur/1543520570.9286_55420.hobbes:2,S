That's bullshit. Prakash has had an answer from Karsten Keil, where
Karsten also commented that kernel 2.2.14 didn't exist yet. So now
Prakash suddenly has jumped to kernel 2.2.20. Also Karsten told him
that the PRO version of the Diva is not supported, yet he continues
to complain that it doesn't work, giving wrong information (e.g.
about his kernel version). Such responses are good at suppressing the
urge to answer messages.
Also don't forget that most of the western world are having holidays at
this time.
