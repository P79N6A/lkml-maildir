Subject: Interrupting __free_pages_OK results in OOPS

My device driver has an interrupt handler which
handles interrupts at a very high priority. Sometimes
the interrupt handler OOPS in __free_pages_OK. Any 
idea why it happens. (The process that was executing
at that time is Python).
System is Redhat 8.0, kernel 2.4.18-4
OOPS happens as follows. 
The interrupt handler pushes "gs" segment register,
while entering and pops "gs" while leaving. Always, it
OOPS at "pop %gs". The value that is popped to "gs" is
0007. The "lar" instruction (load access rights, with
parameter 0007) gives a value 0x0010ec00, which shows
it is a system segment. The code given by the General
Protection Fault is 0004.
Thanks
Santhosh
