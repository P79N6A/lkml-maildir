Subject: [RFC: 2.6 patch] allow disabling DNOTIFY without EMBEDDED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This patch allows disabling DNOTIFY with CIONFIG_EMBEDDED=n.
I'm currently running a kernel with dnotify disabled and I haven't run 
into any problem. Is there any popular application left that breaks 
without dnotify support in the kernel?
Note that this patch does not remove dnotify support, it still defaults
to "y", and the help text recommends enabling it.
