So doing it in the loop doesn't really give you a deterministic
maximum latency if somebody is out to cause trouble, does it?
OTOH, I guess libc or some shared memory segment may be mapped
into a lot of processes even on RT applictions.
Another thing, I don't mean this to sound like a rhetorical question,
but if we have a preemptible kernel, why is it a good idea to sprinkle
cond_rescheds everywhere? Isn't this now the worst of both worlds?
Why would someone who really cares about latency not enable preempt?
