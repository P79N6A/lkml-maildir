I'm curious about the performance of the 4-way and 8-way systems.  I know 
nothing about this benchmark.  IIRC correctly it simulates chat clients 
connecting to a server and talking to each other.  Is it a CPU, memory, or 
disk bound benchmark?  What is causing the 4-way machines to be only 2x the 
performance of the 1-way machine and the 8-way machines to be < 3x the 
performance?  Is the system bus the limiting factor on those machines?
Curiosity aside, it looks like Ingo's scheduler is coming along nicely.
