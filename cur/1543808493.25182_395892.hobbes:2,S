<<< the logic with child_reaper which can be somehow partly inside 
pspace... and this check is not that abvious.
Actually I can't say your patch is cleaner somehow.
It is very big and most of the changes are trivial, which creates an 
illusion that it is straightforward and clean.

1.
flags are neither atomic nor protected with any lock.
So if it will be used later for something else in future, there will be 
100% race. You also assigns them here, while everywhere in other places 
a bit is checked.
2. due to 1) you code is buggy. in this respect do_exit() is not 
serialized with copy_process().
3. due to the same 1) reason
 > +		kill_pspace_info(SIGKILL, (void *)1, tsk->pspace);
can miss a task being forked. Bang!!!
4.
So you are effectively inserting a code for cleaning up pspace here and 
the same is actually required for other subsystems like networking/IPC etc.
I think you suppose that other resources are freed when the last 
reference is dropped, but to tell the truth this is a way to deadlocks. 
Because refs are put in too many places, where you can't make a real 
cleanup due to locking etc. You can't for example call syncronize_net() 
from bh, which is required for network cleanup.
Just an another argument why containers are easier/better and why you 
will eventually end up with it.
