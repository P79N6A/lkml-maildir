Ick, indeed.  Yet another victim of my sneaky attempt to whack one large
patch up into three small patches.  Let's just forget this patch ever
existed, since it doesn't add any new functionality and probably shrinks
the running kernel by a good three bytes.
And I'll quit trying to be sneaky.
Thanks again for your help and patience on this stuff.
