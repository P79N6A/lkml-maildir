There's an ancient one at
http://www.alphalinux.org/archives/axp-list/October1999/0500.html,
although it's probably easier to write it from scratch. I'd write the
whole thing in C, the trap is already so expensive that it's of no use
trying to be clever when emulating the particular instructions (except
when you replace the instruction with a jump to a stub, which seems
somewhat hairy, but feasible).
