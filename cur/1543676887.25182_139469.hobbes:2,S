Why?  It still has our dentry refering to it and contributing into its
->d_count.

->d_parent will not become negative.

Please, take a look at the way normal links work.

Now, _that_ is interesting.  What are you actually seeing there?
Note that unhashing doesn't change _any_ ->d_count - hash chains
are not counted in it and ->d_parent is not changed.
