hi
I'm sorry if this is OT in LKML, but I've tried searching around, and
couldn't find anything.
I have this set-top box with a National Semiconductor Geode SC1200 chip
with a built-in watch-dog plus a lot more.
Does anyone know if there is any support for the sc1200-specific features
in the current kernels, or if there are patches available?
thanks
roy
