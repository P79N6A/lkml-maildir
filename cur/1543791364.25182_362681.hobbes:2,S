 Okay - and 'generic unpluggable kernel RAM' has not been a goal for
 the hypervisor based environments.  I believe it is closer to being
 a goal for those machines which want to hot-remove DIMMs or physical
 memory, e.g. those with IA64 machines wishing to remove entire nodes.

 Ah, but the hypervisor often manages large page sizes, e.g. 64 MB.
 It doesn't manage page rights for each guest OS at the 4 K granularity.
 Hypervisors are theoretically light in terms of memory needs and
 general footprint.  Picture the overhead of tracking rights/permissions
 of each page of memory and its assignment to any of, say, 256 different
 guest operating systems.  For a machine of any size, that would be
 a huge amount of state for a hypervisor to maintain.  Would you
 really want a hypervisor to keep that much state?  Or is it more
 reasonably for a hypervisor to track, say, 64 MB chunks and the
 rights of that memory for a number of guest operating systems?  Even
 if the number of guests is small, the data structures for fast
 memory management would grow quickly.
