I get Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?
On a PPro 200MHz (DELL OptiPlex Pro) with builting Soudblaster (OSS)
and massive access to SCSI disk AHA 1524 (tar xzvf of a big archive)
  7:     686036          XT-PIC  soundblaster
 10:     614871          XT-PIC  aha152x
I would be worth the effort to block interrupts within the drivers
only on an absolutely necessary way. Or is it already happening?
