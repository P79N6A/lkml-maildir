Yours was a good sledge hammer :-) the way it should have been done
but carried legacy boot from i386 that wasnt pretty. The one iam referring
to is pretty darn slow, and think it wont be liked my many to slow down the
system just to add a new cpu.

The only other workable alternate would be to use the stop_machine() 
like thing which we use to automically update cpu_online_map. This means we 
execute a high priority thread on all cpus, bringing the system to knees before
just adding a new cpu. On very large systems this will definitly be 
visible.
Just curious, what performance impact did you allude to that would be lost
if we dont use the shortcut IPI version?

There is nothing currently there to find out if something is hotplug
capable in a generic way at platform level, other than adding cmdline options 
etc.  
Also FYI: ACPI folks are experimenting using CPU hotplug to suspend/resume
support. So hotplug support may be required not just on platforms that support
it but also for other related uses.
