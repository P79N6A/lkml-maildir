But doesn't that approach also make it nearly impossible to script ????
Having to hack source for any apps that one wants to use it on
sounds rather barbaric.. 
(sure I *can* still script it, with background tasksand wait and ..
 but that's getting rather complex again).
Meanwhile.. I'll now cook up a module to try the set/remove_acceptable_latency thing.
Thanks
