I took these out for a brief maxcpus=1 spin yesterday, and noticed
something.  Running 4 copies of chew-max, one as a user, the context
switch rate was high (~1800/s).  I increased sched_min_granularity_ns to
see if that would lower it, and it did, but it also upset fairness.
With sched_min_granularity_ns bumped to half of sched_latency_ns (40ms
default) it was a largish skew.
