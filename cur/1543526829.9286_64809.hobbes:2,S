problem: performance gets roughly halved on a single processor box when
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC is enabled.
hardware: compaq deskpro. 400MHz PII/64Mb RAM/Intel PIIX4 controller, eepro100
network card.
Enabling APIC on single processor boxes seems to roughly halve the performance:
this isn't benchmark rates, but real world applications, e.g. the following
from /usr/bin/time:
2.3.42 without APIC
        Command being timed: "bunzip2 tmp.tar.bz2"
        User time (seconds): 17.86
        System time (seconds): 0.21
        Percent of CPU this job got: 99%
        Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:18.09
        Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 102
        Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 911
        Page size (bytes): 4096
2.3.42 with APIC        Command being timed: "bunzip2 tmp.tar.bz2"
        User time (seconds): 37.80
        System time (seconds): 0.42
        Percent of CPU this job got: 196%
        Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:19.49
        Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 534
        Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 911
(bits snipped that didn't change). Note that the number of major page faults
has jumped massively (and the wall clock time was completely wrong). I've also
noticed that /proc/interrupts shows that the number of interrupts on IRQ 11
(usb-uhci & ethernet) seems much higher with APIC enabled. 
 Can't see any immediate fix, apart from a change to the config menu to put a
warning and maybe remove the comment "Such a kernel will still boot on
IO-APIC-less sstems with no slowdown at all." 
I've got a feeling this is more to do with educating people like me who tend to
select 'y' for anything they've not tried before than actually being a bug but
it's probably worth clarifying.
cheers
