Really? Because most Unix tools don't behave all that strangely when I
enable metadata. If Linux incrementally changes into something that is
not Unix, what is lost, besides the name?
Remember that a filesystem is a specialized database. It is specialized
for performance. If Hans can generalize it without losing that
performance, who can complain?
