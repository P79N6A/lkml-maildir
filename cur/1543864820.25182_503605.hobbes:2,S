I see little difference between your and John's code: both poll 
something - you poll an atomic "did a new clocksource arrive" flag in 
the timer interrupt, John takes the clocksource_lock spinlock and checks 
a "did a new clocksource arrive" variable. Both are global atomic 
variables in essence.
what i'd see as a real cleanup here would be to get away from this 'poll 
whether there's any clocksource update' model, and to just ensure that a 
running timer irq will always see the latest clocksource. I.e. to run 
the change_clocksource() logic (and the following updates) when a new 
clock source is selected - not when the next timer interrupt runs. That 
would propagate all effects of a new clock source immediately.
