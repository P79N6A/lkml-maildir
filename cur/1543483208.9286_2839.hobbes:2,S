This morning, when I switch on my 486, it oopsed while remounting /
read-write.  I didn't write down the entire oops (doh!), but here's what I
managed to salvage:
EIP: c017d8aa (ide_do_request=c017d820)
eax was 13261105, fault address was this plus a bit
call trace:
 c017c11e make_request=c017bc30
 c017bff1 make_request
 c017de09 do_hwgroup_request=c017ddd0
 c017de2b do_ide0_request=c017de20
 c017b6f8 unplug_device=c017b6c0
 c0125006 __wait_on_buffer=c0124f80
 c01251c1 sync_buffers=c0125060
 c01252d7 fsync_dev=c01252b0
 c0128350 do_remount=c0128310
 c01284c9 sys_mount=c0128430
 ...
code: 8a 80 2c 01 00 25 ff 00 00 00 ...
I don't have the object files to put this in source-code context, but I
can regenerate them.
Tim.
