Any driver that uses SCSI bus reset for last-resort error recovery 
(and I think it's pretty typical) needs to be able to renegotiate the 
connection. Maybe even after a SCSI device reset; I don't recall. So 
initiating that negotiation as part of (or after) resume doesn't seem 
all that burdensome.
You need that anyway for "deep sleep" that powers down devices completely.
