Yes.  The basic unit of IO in there is a 64k BIO.  So once readahead
is cruising, pages come unlocked in 16-page batches.  In 2.4 they'll
come unlocked one at a time against a device such as a floppy drive.
But with default settings the readahead code lays one to two of these
BIOs out ahead of the read point, so the application never stumbles across
a locked page unless it's outpacing the device.
At least that's the theory, and the testing I did yesterday
was succesful.
So I'd appreciate it if Simon could invetigate a little further
with the test app I posted.  Something is up, and it may not
be just an NFS thing.  But note that nfs_readpage will go
synchronous if rsize is less than PAGE_CACHE_SIZE, so it has
to be set up right.
