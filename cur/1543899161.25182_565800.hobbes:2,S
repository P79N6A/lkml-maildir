The material on my website was somewhere between pseudocode and
code.  The web site is tutorial in nature, and what Vlasenko did
is follow my tutorial and adapt a working chunk of code from the
many code snippets in the tutorial.
If a signoff from me is required, someone will need to tell me how,
since I have no experience with the protocols for Linux code
development.  I am entirely content with the current form of credit
given to me in the code (a comment with a pointer to my web site).
Frankly, I remain a bit surprise that my work has significant payoff
on a Pentium.  I was motivated by the problems of doing fast binary
to ASCII decimal conversion on a brain-dead little microcontroller
with an 8-bit ALU.
