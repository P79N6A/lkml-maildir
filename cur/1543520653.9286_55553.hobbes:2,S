That is sysadmins "better mousetrap" ;-)

Far too many times, but the rate _has_ slowed down significantly in the
last few years. Might be my imagination, though.

No such attack has been posted recently...

There are audit projects around, the software _is_ getting fixed, server
stuff is being designed/programmed more carefully these days. Sure, you
could decree that all servers must be written in Java or some other "safe"
language, but that will just shift the problems to the implementation of
the language, and have a huge cost in rewriting and retesting. Plus cost a
bundle in performance...

Where do you think script kiddies get their exploit scripts from? They
don't write them themselves: The real crackers share them with the
community. Just like the hacker community shares patches and cool
programs. So you can keep out 99.99% only until one of the 0.01% finds out
a way around it. The danger of "nonexecutable stack" is that it creates a
sense of security, which might be justified as long as it is rare. Once it
becomes widespread, it will be useless in short time, and _everybody_ will
have to pay the cost for nothing at all, while feeling smugly secure.
