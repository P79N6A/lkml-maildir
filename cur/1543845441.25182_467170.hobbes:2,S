Per the standard patch format in Documentation/SubmittingPatches, these 
sort of comments should go beneath the "---" separator.  Otherwise, if 
they are not hand-edited out, they will go into the final changeset

These changes should be in a separate patch.  Makes 'git bisect' work 
better, makes the changes more reviewable, and in general follows the 
"separate logical changes" rule.
