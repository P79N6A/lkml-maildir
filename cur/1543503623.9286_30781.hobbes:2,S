That wasn't really the issue: the problem was that a lot of the important
libraries were in ROM (that is, the code was in ROM; the library struct &
jump table were copied to RAM IIRC, otherwise SetFunction() wouldn't've
worked). Certainly exec.library, intuition.library, dos.library were all in
ROM.

If you think the problem is bad now, just wait until we've solved it.
