Here's a new cut of the shared page table patch.  I divided it into
two patches.  The first one just fleshes out the
pxd_page/pxd_page_kernel macros across the architectures.  The
second one is the main patch.
This version of the patch should address the concerns Hugh raised.
Hugh, I'd appreciate your feedback again.  Did I get everything?
These patches apply against 2.6.17-rc1.
