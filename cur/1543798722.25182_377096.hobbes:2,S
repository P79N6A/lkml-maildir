A number of architectures have a "prefetch for write ownership" 
instruction that you can use for this. Exactly because "ld+cas" should 
not get a shared line initially.
I though sparc had an ASI to do the same? No?

I don't think anybody does, although it wouldn't be impossible. Any OoO 
processor would _tend_ to have enough visibility that they could see any 
stores that are "close" (not just a cas) and might be clever enough to 
modify a memory read to be a read-with-intent-to-write op.
Of course, if it was in memory (as opposed to somebody elses caches), I 
think most cache protocols will start it up in exclusive state anyway. 
Same may or may not happen when you have a dirty hit on another CPU that 
requires a write-back (ie the other CPU would always invalidate on 
writeback).
It would seem to be the obvious thing to do for better lock performance, 
and I'd assume that locks are some of the most common cases of real cache 
interactions, so maybe the shared case only effectively happens if two 
CPU's are reading at the same time.
Somebody who looks at cache protocol diagrams could check. I'm too lazy.
