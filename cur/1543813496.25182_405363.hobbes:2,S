Yes. The RPC_TASK_QUEUED bit can only be cleared when both the
RPC_TASK_WAKEUP bit _and_ the queue spinlock are held.
If you are holding either one of those two, then it is safe to test for
RPC_IS_QUEUED(). If the latter is true, then it is also safe to
dereference the value of task->u.tk_wait.rpc_waitq.
