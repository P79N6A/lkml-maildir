Andi,
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB and CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC show no corruption.
It turns out that NUMA is the culprit and LVM has no effect on any
configuration.  The machine has 6 memory slots.  If I have 4 sticks of
2GB in the machine, it makes zone 0 w/ 8GB and zone 1 disabled.  If I
add two more 2GB sticks (total 12GB, filling all possible 6 slots),
then I have 8GB in zone 0 and 4GB in zone 1, and then a mke2fs on a
280GB /dev/sdb1 works fine.
In conclusion:
    NUMA + 12 GB   -> works
    NUMA + 8 GB    -> OOPS
    no numa + 8 GB -> works
And I suspect that without CONFIG_SMP, 8GB will also work, by virtue
of there only being one NUMA zone.  I haven't tested that yet, but
Randy referred me to these posts, where somebody with the same problem
confirms that disabling NUMA and SMP fixes his problem:

When I boot NUMA w/ 12GB, I get:

When I boot NUMA w/ 8GB, k8topology.c prints out:

I can get you the full dmesg of both configs tomorrow.
Anything else you'd like to see?
