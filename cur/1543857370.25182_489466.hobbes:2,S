Subject: [PATCH 003 of 18] knfsd: nfsd4: clarify units of COMPOUND_SLACK_SPACE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/7/353

From: J.Bruce Fields <bfields@fieldses.org>
A comment here incorrectly states that "slack_space" is measured in words,
not bytes.  Remove the comment, and adjust a variable name and a few
comments to clarify the situation.
This is pure cleanup; there should be no change in functionality.
