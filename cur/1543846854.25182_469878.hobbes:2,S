Hello
unifdef is not only very old and unmaintained, the binary does not work
and the source does not compile on a pure x86_64 system. There is
another tool that worked for me--though it 'closed with remarks'--and
that was updated recently (several times this year). It is called
sunifdef, is under an equal (new) BSD license, and is proposed to be
the successor of unifdef. See the project page:
http://www.sunifdef.strudl.org/
Regards,
Dennis
