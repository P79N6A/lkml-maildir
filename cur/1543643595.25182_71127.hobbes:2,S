Hmmm ... it's not called. The above is exactly all that is called
and LOCAL_END_REQUEST is set. OK. I see what you are saying. Yes, I
will direct my attention to that function instead ...
 ... and yes, I see a possible path in which the queue spinlock may be
taken twice. OK!
Thanks!

!! :-)
Thanks, yes I know! However, it's taken me about 4 days to get it this
far. As you know, complete lockups are hard to debug! There's a race
condition between the printk appearing on the console and the machine
stopping :-(. 
Thanks again.
