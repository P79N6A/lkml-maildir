To what level would you see this going?
I'm currently doing some documentation work on the input subsystem, and it 
produces events (/dev/input/eventX) for every mouse movement, every key press 
(and release), etc. Now most of the application interested in those events 
will get them via X (we just need to interface the input subsystem event 
interface to the X event interface). I see this as a separate daemon or 
daemons. 
Basically you get eventd on every system, and inputd for each console (in a 
multiheaded, multiuser setup).

I think that the eventd advantage is that it is easy to do integration with 
non-event aware apps. Example: eventd re-writes the config file and SIGHUPs 
the application.
