Well, yes and no.
Yes, it's usually a bad idea to do that and expect to get a production- 
level kernel out of it.
But on the other hand, there's a lot that *could* be done with OS kernels  
that has never been tried (even though I certainly couldn't give a list).  
Until someone implements one of those ideas, and experiments with the  
results for a while, it's impossible to know what it would be worth in  
practice. (I certainly wouldn't want to trust a theoretical evaluation!)
Then, *if* it looks good in an experimental OS, people still need to  
figure out how to make use of it in a more traditional kernel. Sometimes  
that's where it breaks. Sometimes not.
If you just remember that academic OSes are *research*, not production  
material, then they are fine. Unfortunately, too many people (including  
many academics) forget that.
There's a reason we have both science and engineering, and they're not the  
same discipline.
