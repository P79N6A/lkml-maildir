It is my understanding that by setting "Protocol" to "auto-dev" and
"Device" to "/dev/psaux" you can freely switch between 2.4 and 2.5.

Does the touchpad sensitivity is OK for you when using then native XFree
driver? Should we bump it up a little?
Plus, there were issues in mousedev regarding PS2 emulation for touchpads
in absolute mode, it should be fixed in -mm or you can try grabbing patches
from 
http://www.geocities.com/dt_or/input/2_6_1/
You are probably mostly interesed in one that deals with mouse jitter.

Why would you document something that is deprecated? It was removed so the
new users would not start using it instead of psmouse.proto. psmouse.noext
should be gone soon.
Plus, you not only disabling Synaptics extensions but Genius and Logitech's
ones as well.
