Perhaps I'm not posting this in the right place, maybe someone will 
point me elsewhere, sorry and thanks in advance.
Basically my problem is getting a coredump by issuing the
``depmod -a'' command on a Linux box... If I insert the modules 
I need by hand using insmod (or modprobe with a modules.dep generated 
on another machine with the same Linux installation (same HardDisk on 
another PC)) I don't get coredumps, everything seems being loaded 
correctly (I'm loading the needed module(s) for a network card). But 
some truly silly networking problems arise:
pinging from another PC (connected to this box by a RJ45 crossed
cable) and vice versa reports success.
If I try to telnet to this box sockets got open immediately, but
I've got a 20 seconds delay before getting to the login screen.
After this initial delay the transfer speed is normal! No more
delays! (I do my job via telnet as I'd do normally on a 10MBps LAN)
Other network services (like SMB/Netbios) don't work, maybe because
the 20 seconds suffice to timeout them...
Among these things the link led of my 3c509 NIC card blinks all 
the time, _regularly_, as to signal an error...
I really don't know it this is a kernel problem (depmod crashes) or
something related to network's setup or again something in the 
3c509.o module...
Thanks a lot for your help!
