Nope, it doesn't fake IDE. It's a bit like EMM - it lives in upper memory, and 
you page in a 8K or 4K chunk of the flash at a time.
In the first page there's a BIOS extension which adds an INT 13h handler to 
drive it, and the driver always leaves the thing with the first page mapped 
in, in case you reboot suddenly.
I knocked up a driver for something similar once. Take a look on 
ftp.yggdrasil.com in the mirror of dwmw2.robinson.cam.ac.uk. It's called 
mtd-98xxxx.tar.gz - You'll need to play with it a bit, and it's only a module 
so far, but it should give you enough to go on.
