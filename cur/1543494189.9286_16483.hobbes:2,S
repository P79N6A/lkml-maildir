I just noticed that even if I mount my NFS mailspool with noac, the
atime stamp doesn't get updated when I read the file. This ofcourse
is because the file is cached in memory, and NFS has no open/close.
It happens on both 2.0.36 and 2.2.7
Right now my "you have new mail" doesn't work, because even if I read
my mail, the atime stamp doesn't get updated.
Sounds like upon a read, the NFS client should update the atime on
the server even if the file was cached. Ofcourse this shouldn't
happen too often - perhaps acatimemin and acatimemax mount options
should be considered? Or as a workaround only after the first read()
on a freshly opened file?
Mike.
