    Erm... Some of /proc/stat data has no relations to disks, namely CPU counts.
    It would be strange to have CPU stats in /proc/diskstats...

    Rick is proposing that all the disk stuff be in /proc/diskstat and
    that all the process stuff be in /proc/stat.  ie: move all the disk
    accounting out of /proc/stat.
