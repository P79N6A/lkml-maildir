Well, Linux is now working on these machines.  I couldn't get a normal
distribution to work but I was able to pull the hard drive, load it on another
machine, and put it back in.  Due to the fact that the system has no legacy
PS/2 ports (or serial and parallel ports) I had to comment out the "Keyboard
timed out" and "pc_keyb: controller jammed" messages in order to see any of
the boot up messages and I've attached them below.  There's a long pause (~3
minutes) right between the "Uncompressing Linux" and "Linux verion ...."
messages on both 2.4 and 2.2 kernels - does anyone have an idea what this
might be from and how to fix it?  I'm assuming it has something to do with the
lack of an AT keyboard and I'm going to start experimenting soon to find it.
Once I get XFree86 working with the Intel i810 video card then everything will
be great.
