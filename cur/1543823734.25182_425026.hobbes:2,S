the most recent one is always in the Fedora rawhide kernel RPM/SRPM. 
(that means it closely tracks upstream.)

certainly looks good to me! What are the changes you did to the 
exec-shield implementation of vdso randomization? The patch seems 
largely identical to the one in exec-shield.
(and it would be nice to do this on x86_64 too - exploits already exist 
using the fixmapped VDSO there as a trampoline.)
