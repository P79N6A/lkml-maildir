So what's the right approach?  I can invent my own easily enough, 
but each driver doing its own thing doesn't seem right.  I assumed 
that it was in scsi.c foi common usage, so each driver that wanted 
to say, use these device type strings in diagnostic messages or 
some such wouldn't have to reinvent this wheel, and so all the 
drivers would consistently use the same names.  Will it be 
replaced with something else?
Just want to know so I don't waste (even more :-) time 
doing something dumb.
Thanks,
