   Agreed.  It's better to keep flush_page_to_ram out of filemap_nopage
   (and how many other _nopages that ought at present to have it according
   to David, but don't).  As things stand, it's being done unnecessarily
   twice on the shared maps: your proposal fixes that.
There are many other cases where flush_page_to_ram overflushes,
its deficiencies are known.
This is why I am suggesting "don't touch this in 2.4 and let's
kill it off in 2.5"
