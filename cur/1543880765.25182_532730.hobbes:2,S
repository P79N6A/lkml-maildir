I 100% agree on this method because I came to nearly the same conclusion on
paper about 1 year ago. What I'd like to add is that the expected wake up time
is not the most precise criterion for fairness. The expected completion
time is better. When you have one task t1 which is expected to run for T1
nanosecs and another task t2 which is expected to run for T2, what is
important for the user for fairness is when the task completes its work. If
t1 should wake up at time W1 and t2 at W2, then the list should be ordered
by comparing W1+T1 and W2+T2.
What I like with this method is that it remains fair with nice tasks because
because in order to renice a task tN, you just have to change TN, and if it
has to run shorter, it can be executed before CPU hogs and stay there for a
very short time.
Also, I found that if we want to respect interactivity, we must conserve a
credit for each task. It is a bounded amount of CPU time left to be used. When
the task t3 has the right to use T3 nsecs, and wakes up at W3, if it does not
spend T3 nsec on the CPU, but only N3<T3, then we have a credit C3 computed
like this :
  C3 = MAX(MAX_CREDIT, C3 + T3 - N3)
And if a CPU hog uses more than its assigned time slice due to scheduler
resolution, then C3 can become negative (and bounded too) :
  C3 = MAX(MIN_CREDIT, C3 + T3 - N3)
Now how is the credit used ? Simple: the credit is a part of a timeslice, so
it's systematically added to the computed timeslice when ordering the tasks.
So we indeed order tasks t1 and t2 by W1+T1+C1 and W2+T2+C2.
It means that an interactive task which has not eaten all of timeslice will
accumulate time credit have great chances of being able to run before others
if it wakes up again, and even use slightly more CPU time than others if it
has not used it before. Conversely, if a task eats too much CPU time, it will
be punished and wait longer than others, and run less, to compensate for the
advance it has taken.
Also, what I like with this method is that it can correctly handle the
fork/exit storms which quickly change the per-task allocated CPU time.
Upon fork() or exit(), it should not be too hard to readjust Tx and Cx
for each task and reorder them according to their new completion time.
I've not found a way to include a variable nr_running in the tree and
order the tasks according to an external variable, hence the need to
rescan the tree upon fork/exit for maximum precision. That's where I
stopped working on those ideas. If someone knows how to order the tree
by (Wx+(Tx+Cx)/nr_running) with nr_running which can change at any time
but which is common for everyone in the tree, that would be great.
Best regards,
Willy
