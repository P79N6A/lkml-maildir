   Okay, okay. Let's spread delays and polling all over numerous init 
scripts.
   You might be ten thousands time right. It is asynchronous process.
   But please listen to me: you are not going to handle that in _every_ 
system application which deals with modules.
   If there is problem, it doesn't mean we just pass it over. Probably 
we need to solve it?
