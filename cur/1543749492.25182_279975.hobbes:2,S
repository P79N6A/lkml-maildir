Hi, im mainly a lurker but need to ask whether the newer freeBSD fs
(UFS2) is readable and writable.
I have googled a round to find that i can mount / as read only but no
more. Is it possible to mount my /usr partition within the BSD slice.
(ie i want to get ot /usr/home/$user/
-- 
Theres no place like ::1
Thanks,
SimonB
