And it's just that initial installation boot, via grub, which really
matters.  Thereafter can be edited, before perhaps switching to LILO.

I do agree that positives are easier to understand than negatives,
and if it were some C variable I'd be arguing the same way.
But we seem to have a long tradition of "no" boot options to disable
features, and you're asking to reverse that tradition: fair enough,
but let's be clear about that.  Might be easiest to understand if
every "no" has a no-"no".  (But then where does the CONFIG come in?)

Good, but then they should be in a separate patch.
