	One of my collegues is using Aironet 342 card at his Linux
	laptop with lattest PCMCIA-CS package.
	The basic card functionality is ok, but hardware crypto usage
	isn't (string/buffer overflows, and some runtime parameter
	passing stupidities) - he made some patches to get 128 bit
	crypto to work.
