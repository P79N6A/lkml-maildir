You guys all sound confused about this.
The original reason writing for the onetouch driver was because the
button on this disk drive isn't an HID device!  That is, the drive
doesn't include any of the usual HID descriptors for the button and the
button doesn't send HID-style reports.
Torsten's assessment was correct.  Originally there was no PM support 
for the onetouch driver.  Now there is (although it isn't very good), 
so it would be legitimate to remove the !PM condition.
As far as I know, the only person who ever used the onetouch driver was 
its author.
