Yes, they're not merged because the are no contiguous blocks in the list.

Yes, I think
  if (!MERGE(rq))
    ADD_NEW(rq);
is not atomic when the list is full.

NOREQ is shoun only when it tries to add a new item to the list, but it is
full.

Elevator latency is not the problem in this case. (Yes, I checked it too)
