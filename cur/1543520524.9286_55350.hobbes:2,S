It sounds like you want a VM-based block device not a RAM-based block
device.  Since you have to format the RAMdisk, you are going to touch a
bunch of pages inside your 64M ramdisk, which makes OOM a distinct
probability.
If a VM filesystem is what you want, check out Eric Biderman's shmfs.
URL should be somewhere in linux-mm archives.  I don't have it handy,
but I'll dig it out if you can't find it.
I also have a tiny bit of code which attempts to the 2.3.x
map_user_kiobuf code to do the same thing, but it isn't working yet (for
obvious reasons).
