 I followed the advise to compile a new util-linux package and this did
 the trick. I made a copy of the old login version before so I could find the 
 problem. Unfortunately now even the backupped version works better than 
 before i.e. it doesn't loop forever anymore but just a few minutes....
 Anyway I added an strace (It was quite a lot hacking work to get
 strace-3.1 to compile, a more recent version anyone?)...
