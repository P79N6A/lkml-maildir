Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As this patch is too big for the list, it can be found at:
http://jumi.lut.fi/~paalanen/scratch/mmio25-b/0004-x86-mmiotrace-move-files-into-arch-x86-mm.patch
The patch is 85 kB and Documentation/SubmittingPatches says I should not
post it to the list if it exceeds 40 kB.
Ingo, I can also send this directly to your email, if you wish.
