And because, in a filesystem, you have to handle collisions
you balance the cost of the hash quality against the cost of
collision.  A cheap hash with low colission rate is probably
better than an expensive hash with a near-zero colission
rate.

Nicely described, but each block now needs a reference count
which is incrmented if the raw compare yields a positive and
decremented when a reference to it receives a write.
It may help to also have a reverse reference somewhere
from the block to the hash.
More detail than this gets into writing pseudocode.

Under current schemes if i overwrite an already allocated
block of a file the block list need not be updated unless
the block is relocated.  But that is a nit.
