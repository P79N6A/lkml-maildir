vSMP is a hypervisor based architecture. For some reason that is not
100% clear to me, but Kiran or Shai can probably explain, it needs this 
additional bit in EFLAGS when interrupts are disabled. That gives
it some hints and then it goes somehow faster. That is clearly
paravirtualization.
Since paravirtops is designed to handle such hooks cleanly I request
that you move vSMP over to it or work with the vSMP maintainers to 
do that. Otherwise we have two different ways to do paravirtualization 
which is wrong.
