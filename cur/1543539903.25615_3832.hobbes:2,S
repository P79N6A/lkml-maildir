The kernel has "zones" for different kinds of RAM that can be accessed
in different ways, but it still assumes they are more or less the same
speed.  This means that if the PCI RAM were allocated for a user space
page, it would stay continue using the PCI RAM even if it's used
heavily.
If instead you use the PCI RAM as a ramdisk and swap to it,
any program which makes heavy use of a page will cause the page to stay
in main RAM where it should remain.
