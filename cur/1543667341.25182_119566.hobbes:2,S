Try it with a modern library (like the one in the RH phoebe beta), and
you'll see system calls having sped up by a factor of two. Even on UP.
But there's certainly something wrong with your open/close/stat numbers.
I don't see anywhere _near_ those kinds of differences, and there are no
real SMP locking issues there either. Are you sure you're testing the
same setup?
Oh, and the TCP bandwidth thing is at least partly due to the fact that TCP
loopback does extra copies due to debugging code being enabled.
