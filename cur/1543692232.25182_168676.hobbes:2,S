To the part below. Sorry, I changed the structure of the mail but forgot to

The A2091 and GVP-II drivers want to traverse the list of SCSI host adapters in
their interrupt handler, to find their Scsi_Host instances and check whether
the (shared) interrupt was meant for one of them.
An alternative would be to register the interrupt handler multiple times and
use the Scsi_Host instance pointer as the interrupt handler data pointer.
For 53c7xx it's a bit more complex, I don't know anything about its internals.
In all 3 cases, I don't have the hardware...
