Don't assume "nobody does..."  There is always someone that do.
This particular one will easily come up for anybody who
develop boot floppies:
1.  Mount the boot floppy at /mnt
2.  Test the device files in /mnt/dev, _perhaps by using them
    in every way imaginable_
3.  Umount the boot floppy. - There goes /mnt/dev and a bunch
    of block devices.  
Umounting some dev/ is common enough.
