This "supersync" already exists, and it is supported by all of the
journaling filesystems for LVM snapshots.  This is the VFS method
write_super_lockfs in the ext3/reiserfs/XFS/JFS super_operations.
Not only does it sync the dirty data to disk, but it also forces
the journal to be empty and marks the filesystem clean, so that it
can be snapshotted and read-only mounted (basically equivalent to
unmounting the filesystem).
Unfortunately, even though the filesystems themselves have supported
this VFS method for a long time, the actual code that calls these
methods (sync_super_lockfs() and unlockfs()) are still only available
as a patch from LVM.  The LVM/reiserfs folks have talked about submitting
it to Marcelo for a long time now, but apparently still haven't done so.
Cheers, Andreas
