	That tells you nothing more than the processor that was running when the
document was generated. Similar data is available from the IP address, host
name, user name, date/time, and the MAC address.
	But I don't follow the general argument. That a feature can be used for a
bad purpose is not grounds for disabling it, is it? If it has the potential
to make something a bit more secure, surely that's a good thing. If it
doesn't, then how can it compromise privacy?
	If a malicious program wants to leak person information about you, then it
can do so with or without a PSN.
