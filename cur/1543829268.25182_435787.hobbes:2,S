You probably first suspend a process? If a process was suspended by 
swsusp then we can just ignore the restriction because it will be 
returned later.
The admin wants the system to behave in a consistent way. If he suddenly 
finds a process running on a cpu that was forbidden then that is weird 
and surprising to say the least and may go undetected for a long time.
If the process gets killed when he disables the cpu then he will have to 
fix up his cpu restrictions.
