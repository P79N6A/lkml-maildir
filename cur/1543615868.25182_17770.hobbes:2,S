agreed, a truncate_inode_pages before ->truncate is needed, or after an
extension the old bh could be still there mapped to random in the
leftover page. But still the whole vmtruncate looks overkill, there
cannot be vm mappings in the way of our truncate because in
prepare_write we worked after the i_size if truncate will later do
something. pages in the middle if i_size cannot be mapped either, so if
it was a partial write that still couldn't be mapped.
