Andre, The summary of the change is this: without this change, the PCI init
for chipsets does not get called.  I'll speak specifically about the CSB5. 
The CSB5 in non-native mode has a PCI irqline register forced to 0.  The
PCI probe then skips it's PCI init and it never gets called.
We then see that there is no file in /proc/ide for the serverworks
chipset.  With this fix, there is.
Is there something else we aren't doing, instead?  This seems obvious -
there is NOWHERE else that calls the init_chipset() method.
I put a printk in the pci_init_svwks routine, and it doesn't get called.

Please show me what you mean - my desktop has an IRQ of zero, also.  I do
have some control over BIOS, too.
Please, I'd like to resolve this issue once and for all :)
Patch attached again for completeness..
