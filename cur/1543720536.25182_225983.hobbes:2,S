well and low-powered handhelds are one field where linux should run :)
at least on my zaurus its running happily [okay this doesn't have a
pcmcia slot, just an sd/card and cf/card]

Well I wouldn't put PCMCIA into the same part as ISA and Pentium I,
because my 2 year old Sonylaptop with a Pentium-M 4 1.5Ghz has PCMCIA
slots ... So its not like it is found only on stone old Laptops.

yeah but its very rare to find 386 (except perhaps junkyards), but its
very common to find PCMCIA. way more easy than Pentium I or ISA slots ...
