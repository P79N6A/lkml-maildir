	That is about the 'Large-File-Summit' thing.
	The file must be opened with  O_LARGEFILE, if the desired pread
	offset isn't presentable in kernel  off_t  type variable. (32-bit
	signed integer at i386, 64-bit signed integer at Alpha..).
	(Maximum begin offset is INT_MAX-1 anyway, as the last readable
	 character is at INT_MAX -- without O_LARGEFILE flag, that is.)

	Quite so.
