Hi,
I can't compile with success my kernel, i've got this error message :
   Building modules, stage 2.
   MODPOST 1750 modules
WARNING: Can't handle masks in drivers/ide/pci/atiixp:FFFF05
WARNING: "try_to_freeze" [drivers/usb/atm/ueagle-atm.ko] undefined!
make[2]: *** [__modpost] Erreur 1
make[1]: *** [modules] Erreur 2
When I uncheck this module, the compiled kernel works, but there are 
many problems and the kernel fails after minutes.
I use a Nvdia Geforce graphic card.
Thanks for help,
Thibaud.
