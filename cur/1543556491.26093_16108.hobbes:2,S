Most architectures dump their code as a string of bytes and print the
code after the registers and trace back.  Alpha dumps the code before
the trace and also decodes the instructions which really confuses
ksymoops.  Somebody changed 'Trace: ' to 'Trace:' between 2.2 and 2.4
kernels so ksymoops no longer picks the trace data.
Is there any chance of changing arch/alpha/kernel/traps.c to print
registers, trace and _raw_ code, in that order so it is more like other
architectures?  You can print the decoded instructions as well (prefix
Decode:, not Code:) as long as the raw code bytes are also available.
In the meantime, this patch to ksymoops 2.3.5 will pick up the change
to the trace lines.  It will still complain about a bad code line,
ksymoops is built for raw data.
