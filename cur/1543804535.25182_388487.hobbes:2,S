The one machine I've got running 2.6+devfs under debian chokes in initrd 
with an inability to find devfs during boot so I had to go back to static 
/dev entries for it since atleast in sarge right now I'm not seeing a 
quick-and-easy way to get devfs like support bundled via mkinitrd, but I 
haven't looked, and I shouldn't have to.  It shouldn't have gone away in a 
stable kernel in teh first place.  I realise things are changing, and need 
to change but that's called development, and belongs in a development tree.
