Ahh yes, the per file limit.  BTW, why are you saying "To" and "Go" when 
you apparently mean "TB" and "GB"?

The fat data structures do not encourage fragmentation any more or less 
than ext2/3.  NTFS is slightly better, more comparable to reiserfs than 
ext2/3, but the difference is small.  What causes massive fragmentation 
is how the driver chooses to allocate new blocks as you write to files. 
  Microsoft has always used about the worst possible algorithm for doing 
this you can imagine, which is why fragmentation has always been a big 
problem on their OSes.  Linux is smarter and allocates blocks such that 
fragmentation is kept to a minimum.

I have not done any testing, but I know no reason why it would be worse 
than fat.  It does not do transaction logging, and there currently is no 
fsck for it, so for safety reasons, it may not be such a good choice. 
If you want reliability, efficiency, and posix semantics, I'd go with 
reiserfs or ext3.

I agree.  I think the VFS layer should process the uid/gid options.  By 
default it should replace nobody with the specified id, and fat and ntfs 
  should just report all files as owned by nobody.  Then a new option 
should be added to force the translation for all ids, not just nobody.

Eww, that is quite a kludge.
