Here's an update to my patchset
http://kernel.kolivas.org
Includes:
O(1) scheduler with batch scheduling
Preemptible
Low Latency
Read Latency2
Autoregulated VM
Variable Hz
Scheduler Tunables
Desktop Tuning
Supermount NG
XFS 1.2
ACPI
CPU Frequency Scaling
NForce2 update
Packet writing
GCC 3.3 fixes
Optional extras not included in full patch but available:
2.5 Interactivity update
Swap prefetching
Lowest Latency Disk Hack
AA VM addons
RMAP
Compressed Caching.
Changes:
Patch restructure to allow easy selection and applying of split out patches.
Major change is my VM hacks that are now the default. These use the default VM 
with changes based on the system and memory stress the kernel senses to 
create a VM that's cachier with free memory and aggressive at avoiding swap. 
It builds on the lean nature of the default VM without adding noticeable 
overhead. See my website for a lengthier description or the patch itself for 
documented code.
The desktop tuning is now 10/40 ms for min/max timeslice, and further tuning 
to avoid that nasty nasty i/o elevator pause problem. MCP and I are working 
hard on trying to find a useful fix since noone else is interested any more. 
See 
http://kernel.kolivas.org/elevator.html
 for more info.
Supermount has been revamped to the new supermount-ng code 
(
http://supermount-ng.sf.net
)
Nforce2 update and GCC3.3 fixes.
Optional:
I've implemented some simple (read braindead) but effective swap prefetching 
code which slowly trickles in pages from swap when the machine is idle and 
there is free ram.
For the most resistant cases of i/o induced pauses I have the nasty lowest 
latency disk hack I made which drops throughput significantly but will remove 
them entirely.
The AA VM addons are now optional instead of the default as I've moved to my 
VM addons, and will rip out my changes (as is the case with rmap).
Compressed caching adds to my VM addons instead of AA.
Feel free to send me queries, comments, suggestions, patches etc.
Regards,
Con Kolivas
