#! would be a nice option to increase capabilities on invocation. But the
final target must be linked to the invocation by an entity/revision binding.
Since we do not have modification versions i could think about checksums:
#!#/bin/setcap

+NET_ADMINe
This even will add another integrity checking layer tp the system.
