Maybe you are right in theory. There are 3 things that make theory different
from practice right now:
1) Serial sysrq is reported no to work for 2.4 kernels. 
2) You cannot compile a 2.4-test kernel without CONFIG_VT but with 
   CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ right now; the dep_bool change is just making 
   this explicit.
3) Even 2.2.16 doesn't seem to contain code for Serial sysrq
Please, fix the first two issues before removing the "dep_"....
