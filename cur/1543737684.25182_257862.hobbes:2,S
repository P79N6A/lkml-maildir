I don't really understand this comment.  update_cpu_clock is called from
schedule and from scheduler_tick.  When it was last called by schedule,
p->timestamp will mark this time.  When it was last called by
p->scheduler_tick, rq->timestamp_last_tick will mark this time.
Hence the max of the two is the last time update_cpu_clock was called.

I don't know what you think is missing.  If the "normalization" you are
talking about is this kind of thing:
		p->timestamp = p->timestamp - rq_src->timestamp_last_tick
				+ rq_dest->timestamp_last_tick;
then that is not relevant here.  That normalizes the timestamp to the new
CPU when changing from one CPU to another.  This is not something that
matters for the sched_time tracking, because that only uses the difference
between a timestamp when the thread went on a CPU and the timestamp when it
went off.  When a thread switches CPUs without yielding, this normalization
will happen to its ->timestamp, and then the next update_cpu_clock will be
taking the difference of the newly-appropriate ->timestamp value against
the current CPU's sched_clock value.

Here again I don't know what you are talking about.  Nothing is ever read
"off another CPU".  A thread maintains its own sched_time counter while it
is running on a CPU.

Please explain.
