The binary issue could very easily be solved, as you said, by a small 
generic program to do the conversion. Upside it only shell scripts need 
this, while more advanced (lower level) programs will get better preformance 
out of binary format. Downside? I am not sure I see the problem. If a 
program needs to get a lot of /proc info frequently, a binary interface will 
be faster. Idealistically, do we want the kernel interfaces binary or ascii? 
Do we want them to preform best with (be native to) shell scripts or 
programs?
In any event, is the format of process info (actually should be in /proc) or 
the-other-stuff the issue? If it is the latter, the compatibility issue has 
a fairly easy solution...

I like this idea a lot, and so far I haven't heard any objections, save 
compatability...

Simple solution is to move /kernel stuff of /proc to /kernel (new format, 
bin, ascii, whatever) and put transition code (old code still serving the 
old format /kernel stuff) serving in /proc. Make the backwards compatibility 
/proc a compile option. That way, userland developers will have time to 
migrate to /kernel (or whatever it should be called). Not too much effort, 
makes userland developers not sweat to death...
