I own the private I2C bus and eeprom is the only chip that will attach
to the bus. I need to do the link in the driver since there are four
busses and upto two monitors. The driver knows how to pair the head up
with the right bus.
if (dev_priv->primary_head.connector != ddc_none)
  list_for_each(item,
&dev_priv->i2c[dev_priv->primary_head.connector].adapter.clients) {
    client = list_entry(item, struct i2c_client, list);
    sysfs_create_link(&dev->primary.dev_class->kobj,
&client->dev.kobj, "monitor");
    break;
  }
