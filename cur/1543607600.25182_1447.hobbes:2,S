Is that manual page incorrect?
I would think that 
	strsep() returns NULL  when *stringp points to '\0' character
	and that if delim is not found in stringp then stringp
	is just advanced to '\0' character of string (and original
	*stringp value is returned)
If that is not true, then these all patches are incorrect.
Namely last token will be skipped.
