Besides "make menuconfig", is there anything else in the kernel that's 
using lxdialog?
I ask because I have always wanted to add an "Abort" button for when you 
exit menuconfig that gives users the choice of returning to the root 
menu, rather than exiting (e.g. You're exiting by mistake).  I started 
working on a modification this morning and realized that menuconfig 
relies on lxdialog (particularly scripts/lxdialog/yesno.c) for 
displaying the dialog with the "Yes" and "No" buttons on it.
I almost completed a modification that will display the "Abort" button 
*only* if called with the correct parameter (in other words, it defaults 
to only the "Yes" and "No" buttons).  However, I'd like to test that I 
haven't broken anything else that might be relying on lxdialog.  In 
particular, I'm concerned with anything using the "yesno" functionality 
of lxdialog that I may have overlooked.
Thank you,
