Okay, I give in.  If we do wish to support RAID-1, we still need a way
of mapping one logical block to multiple physical blocks.  I suggested an
index to the call, Werner suggests a variable length return.  Anyone have
any strong opinions?
Note that Werner's objection to whether or not the file pointer is
advanced if one is supposed to make a repeated call can be solved by
changing FIONDEV to never advance the file pointer, after all the
application can do this for itself quite easily.
