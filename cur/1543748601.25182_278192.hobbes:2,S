Good question...  When I originally released Squashfs (Oct 2002) the 2.5 
kernel had just gone into the feature freeze and I was waiting for the 
unfreeze that would happen when 2.7 arrived.  As the official stance on 
additions to 2.6 has been relaxed I have thought about submitting it.
I need to tidy up the code a bit before I submit it to the merciless 
scrutiny of LKML :-)  Nothing bad (I hope) but there's lots of long 
lines and I do know LKML'mers like 80 columns.
I'm planning on adding ea/acl support (people have been asking for 
them), I can't decide whether to submit it now or wait until I've 
finished them.  Suggestions and advice would be welcome.
Slightly off topic, I've noticed you're the kernel maintainer for 
Gentoo.  You mentioned somewhere you're down to 4 kernel patches, 
including Squashfs? :) A lot of people/projects are now using Squashfs 
and it would help a lot of people (and me) if it did get into the 
kernel.  Plus it would be a nice thing for me anyway to have finally got 
it included.

Phillip
