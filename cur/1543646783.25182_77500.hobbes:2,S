The user times are really comparable. And total user time, too. I'm
taking the node affine patches to 2.5.39 and will rerun them ASAP.

I was running several of these to see which features help and to try
to understand where the advantage comes from. In the output tables
you can see where the job has spentits time and on which node it started.
You can also recognize from the user time how well a job ran. Alone on
it's node: 27s, away from it's memory: 36s (or so), sharing the node
with others: 27-32s, running on wrong node with others: up to 43s. And
seeing these you can understand how well a feature works or how much
you miss another feature. It wasn't my plan to advertise the node
affine scheduler, it just has most of the features.

Yes, great!

OK, but how about the node-wise selection and balancing? Then we get
the approaches closer...

Is in preparation. First step: pooling scheduler without multi-level
support but node-wise initial balancing.

Sorry about that. Didn't have a newer measurement.

Yes. We're trying to get that stuff in but David's away from his email
for a while as you know.
