For users you use resource limits to stop them *before* they reach OSS.
We were discussing sophisticated applications which need to take control
over mm of their address space. No bad you need root permissions to do that.

I don't think the above comment is about overcommitting swap space.
He's talking about sharing the text segments of processes, i think.
But you should ask Linus, I was not there at the moment (01.12.91) B-).
