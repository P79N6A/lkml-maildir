rmk> Here is some more of the patch for the assembly rule migration.  This
rmk> time, it covers just the x86 makefiles.  As you can see, to enable
rmk> the new rules, we need to set USE_STANDARD_AS_RULE to be "true", and
rmk> any extra flags that the old rule was using must be included into
rmk> EXTRA_AFLAGS.  If we have any extra per-file flags, they go into
rmk> AFLAGS_name_of_object.o, just like EXTRA_CFLAGS/CFLAGS_name.o.
