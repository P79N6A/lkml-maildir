Hi,
About your /dev/sysdat patch - have you actually benchmarked and proved
that it does indeed speed up gettimeofday(2) (or more precisely new 
gettimeofday(3) vs old gettimeofday(2))?
Yes, conceptually your approach is obviously correct but seeing benchmark
numbers is somewhat more pleasing to the eye...
Regards,
