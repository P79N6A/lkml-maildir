Hi,
	Seems there is a problem with the inode generation number handling in
	ext2. The problem is when an inode gets reused after a file is created
	and later deleted causing it's filesystem inode to get released. Now if
	the same inode (on disk) gets reused then the inode generation number
	won't properly reflect that the inode does'nt refer to the old file any
	longer (the one that was deleted).
	CURRENTLY:
	In ext2_new_inode() we call get_empty_inode() that clears the
	"i_generation" in the inode that it returns. ext2_new_inode() then
	increments i_generation before returning to the caller (say
	ext2_create()). Now should'nt we be updating the inode generation
	number with whats there on disk ??? Else the inode gets a new
	generation number which is incorrect.
	When we "sync" an inode back to disk then we store the i_generation
	value into the disk inode (in ext2_update_inode()). But when a inode is
	allocated newly as in ext2_new_inode() while we set up the inode we will
	need to set i_generation to the value thats there on disk.

   475                  inode->i_flags |= MS_SYNCHRONOUS;
   476          insert_inode_hash(inode);
   477          inode->i_generation++; /* <-- need to set this to the
					generation counter on disk ??
   478          mark_inode_dirty(inode);
