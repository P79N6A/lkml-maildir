ah ...
could this be some DMA starvation effect? Or is this xrun calculated
from arrival of the audio interrupt (hence DMA completion) to the actual
running of jackd?

your above observation wrt. linearity of the xrun makes it less likely
that the issue is caused by page sharing between jackd and
mlockall-test. (if then they share a constant amount of pages.)
but it would be nice to test it anyway, i've attached mlock-test.cc.
