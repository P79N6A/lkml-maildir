OK I've updated fslint which can be downloaded @
http://www.iol.ie/~padraiga/fslint/fslint-1.11.tar.gz
To merge 2 linux trees you do: ./findup -m /usr/src/linux[12]
This will take about 37 seconds (note freedups takes 15
minutes to do the same). Note be careful that your editor
handles hardlinked files as you expect.
