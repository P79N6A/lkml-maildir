Robert Hancock thought this was a hardware problem.
He was right.
I switched around cables on the hot-swap backplane, figuring that I 
would determine whether I had a bad cable or a bad backplane ( hoping 
for a bad cable ) and the problem went away.   One of the cables wasn't 
seated properly apparently.  ( It was a tight 1U box with very 
aggressive twist-ties that I had to cut to switch them around, so this 
wasn't immediately obvious.
I would make sure that all cables are seated properly, and try a 
different cable if the problem persists.
