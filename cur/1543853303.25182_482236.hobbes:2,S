tried it again with this patch (on top of all the other patches).
overall things are much better than they've been in a long time
(thanks!), but... when cdparanoia gets stuck, if i abort the process
and restart it the ripping proceeds very slowly (~5x before, ~1.5x
after). if i eject/insert the cd and then restart cdparanoia the speed
is as before (~5x). something doesn't get reset until the cd is
ejected, don't know if it's the kernel's fault though. same thing
happens if i get an error reading a sector but then cdparanoia manages
to recover. from that point on the speed is very slow (again until i
eject/insert the cd; a new instance of cdparanoia is just as slow).
