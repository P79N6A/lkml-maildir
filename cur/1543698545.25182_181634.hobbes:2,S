Yes that was me. PATA TCQ is currently disabled in the 2.6 kernel
configs, and it will most likely just go away sometime soonish. It's not
a very useful feature, PATA TCQ is pretty broken. I knew this from the
beginning, but thought that it would be fun to try it in real life. It's
just not worth it, though.
SATA host queueing support will be useful.
