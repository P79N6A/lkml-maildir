Subject: PATCH: SCSI scanorder enhancement

The kernel assigns minor SCSI device numbers dynamically. This is done by
assigning them only to actually connected devices in order of their SCSI-id's
(mostly ascending). This means that connecting an external SCSI device changes
the minors of all internal devices with a higher SCSI-id forcing me to change
/etc/fstab when connecting the external device and to change it back when
disconnecting the device.
I created a small scsiorder patch to solve this by fixing the problem where it
originates. For example the kernel parameter "scsi_scanorder=1,10,6" means to
scan the devices in the following order: 1,10,6,0,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,13,15.
Which means SCSI-id's 1,10,6 and 0 will allways be mapped on sda, sdb, sdc en
sdd (if all connected).
The latest version supports the specification of a specific adapter as well,
based both on io address and base address:
"scsi_scanorder=base=0xfdffa000:1,10,6;io=0x330:1,2"
The patch applies to both 2.2.10 and 2.3.12 kernels.
I hope the "base=.." qualifier makes it useful for non-intel hardware as well,
so if people with that hardware would like to test it...

 There's
a small description of the alternatives like devfs and scsidev as well.
cheers!
Rolf.
