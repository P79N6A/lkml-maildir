It is an unrestricted SCSI low-level call.
Prepare to reformat your drive after it is executed, this rips everything.
It does not touch the hardware in any bad ways.
It is small, compact, and can be pushed into a shellstack.
There is no protection patch for this to date.
Your only way to stop it is a SCSI-IOCTL command-parser.
You asked, have fun........
