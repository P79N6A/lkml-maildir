Hey there-
I'm not sure on the first question, but I suspect no is the answer.
On the second, I attempted to have a module driver install multiple
network devices (register_netdev() I believe) based on data passed to
it from a SIOCDEVPRIVATE call to the installed module. This failed
because SIOCDEVPRIVATE calls get a kernel lock, and register_netdev()
attempts to get the same lock.
There were two ways I could see around this: (1) create a /dev file to
control the device, or (2) hack the SIOCTL handler source. I haven't
done either yet.
