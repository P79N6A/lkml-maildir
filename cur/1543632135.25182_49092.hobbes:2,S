Subject: Kernel zombie threads after module removal.

This is very close to the problem related in 
http://lkml.org/archive/2002/2/4/368/index.html
but I have no USB. I have SCSI with aha152x_cs.o,
and after doing "cardctl eject" that removes the module,
the process scsi_eh_0  stays as zombie.
If I repeat the operation of card insert and eject,
I get  several  scsi_eh_0  zombies.
Now  with 2.4.18, but  I have got this problem with others 2.4 kernels.
