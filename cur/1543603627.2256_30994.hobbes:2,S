Not really.  The latest UML is sometimes pretty far ahead of what's in the
-ac tree, but it usually works fine.  So, if you're interested in the generic
kernel, and not UML itself, that shouldn't be a problem.  And currently, 
the -ac tree is pretty close to my CVS.
Also, the latest patches usually go pretty cleanly into the -linus pre kernels,
so getting those running in UML shouldn't be hard.

This is just because no one has written the code to do it.  It is perfectly
possible to do hardware device driver development in UML.  Various USB people
have started trying to do USB driver development under UML, for example.
