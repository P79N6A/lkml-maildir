The majority of "nfs sucks" complaints result from the general lack of
understanding by sysadmins of the nfs caching model. I'd be very
sceptical of any claim that most sysadmins "expect" broken cache
consistency as a result of mounting the same filesystem with different
mount options.

NFSv2 has a close-to-open caching model which works fine as long as you
don't break the underlying assumptions. See my comment above.
