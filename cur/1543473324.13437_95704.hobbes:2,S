AFAIR that statement is recommended to append to your program's
source and/or display.  If you say "This program is GPL version 2
period" I believe it is then GPL 2 period, regardless of wether a
3 comes out.  Richard, do you care to clarify this?
Also, keep in mind that probably 90% (total random guess) of all
software out there that claims it is GPL, does not follow the
guidelines of the GPL properly, and display the proper messages,
etc.  Many GPL programs don't include the COPYING document
either, which is also a requirement.
Sooner or later someone will end up in court.  I guess within 2
years...
