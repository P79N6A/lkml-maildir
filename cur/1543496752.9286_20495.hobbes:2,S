For elf executables it is easy: just add NOTE segments and put
whatever you want into it. Elf executables already _have_ structure
inside. It is not easy to manipulate but it can be done.
Why not add NOTE sections for icons? I could create nice filesystem
into podfuk to manipulate NOTE sections as easily as files... Would it
solve your troubles?
If you did some hack with adding tar files at the end of executables,
you could do your proposed things with minimal changes! Take a look at
podfuk.

PS: Or you may go for tar files. On my system [this already works]:
	cat file.tar | uuenpipe | mail you 
will work, and even
	cat file.tar#utar/some.file | uuenpipe | mail you.
Without modification on kernel! This might be solution for many of
your
problems. (
