I tested this again today with a few changes.  It appears that if pcmcia.ko
(or rather the .c files that make it up) are compiled with -Os, it will fail
to register a character device.  Being that one of my goals for this was to
fit everything on a floppy, I had to use -Os when building the kernel. 
(pcmcia was not one of the modules that belongs on the floppy, however I
did not want to have to compile the kernel and then again for the modules
w/o -Os)
I believe that pcmcia.ko is the only module I am using that  uses a dynamic
major.
