In a widely anticipated move, Linux "headcase" Torvalds today announced
the immediate availability of the most advanced Linux kernel to date,
version 2.6.20.
Before downloading the actual new kernel, most avid kernel hackers have
been involved in a 2-hour pre-kernel-compilation count-down, with some
even spending the preceding week doing typing exercises and reciting PI
to a thousand decimal places.
The half-time entertainment is provided by randomly inserted trivial
syntax errors that nerds are expected to fix at home before completing
the compile, but most people actually seem to mostly enjoy watching the
compile warnings, sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, scroll past. 
As ICD head analyst Walter Dickweed put it: "Releasing a new kernel on
Superbowl Sunday means that the important 'pasty white nerd'
constituency finally has something to do while the rest of the country
sits comatose in front of their 65" plasma screens". 
Walter was immediately attacked for his racist and insensitive remarks
by Geeks without Borders representative Marilyn vos Savant, who pointed
out that not all of their members are either pasty nor white.  "Some of
them even shower!" she added, claiming that the constant stereotyping
hurts nerds' standing in society. 
Geeks outside the US were just confused about the whole issue, and were
heard wondering what the big hoopla was all about. Some of the more
culturally aware of them were heard snickering about balls that weren't
even round.

Shortlog since 2.6.20-rc7. Fixes, fixes.
There's a full ChangeLog together with the tar-ball and patches, but let 
me just summarize it as: "A lot of stuff. All over. And KVM."
I tried rather hard to make 2.6.20 largely a "stabilization release". 
Unlike a lot of kernels lately, there aren't really any big fundamental 
changes to some core infrastructure area, and while we always have bugs, I 
really am hoping that we fixed many more than we introduced. 
Have fun. And remember: the thousandth decimal is, of course, 9. There 
*will* be a test on this afterwards.
