Hello Russell,

I completely understand what you keep on saying, but that would imply
that the following piece of code in chip.c is completely bogus anyway!
(snip from mainline 2.6.23)
handle_simple_irq(unsigned int irq, struct irq_desc *desc)
...
	if (unlikely(!action || (desc->status & IRQ_DISABLED))) {
		if (desc->chip->mask)
			desc->chip->mask(irq);
...
}
Why trying to mask the interrupt if that is illegal use of the interrupt type?
This piece of code assumes that there CAN be a handler for masking
interrupts for the simple_irq type. This is in contradiction what you
are trying to explain.
If what you say is (completely) true the code is better to be:
....
		if (desc->chip->mask)
                             BUG();
....
IMO, interrupts can still be simple_irq types if the interrupt source
does **not have to** be disabled to be able to handle them. These
(GPIO) interrupts signal an event, that is already gone when the
interrupt handler starts, they are **never** really pending, waiting
for some device driver to handle the event. The device does not really
care if the interrupt is really handled, it just generates a new
interrupt on the next event.
And yes, it is possible that these interrupts can be seperately
masked/unmasked, but it is not necessary, and therefor others chose
apparantly for the simple_irq() types.
So, I do not think that the argument of **can** masked/unmasked is
valid, but more the **need** to be masked/unmasked is valid.
I think we should not argue if this is correct use, or misuse.
Fact is now that there is a bug in RT, that this type of 'misuse' does
not work on RT and breaks the interrupt handling. There are even more
patches floating around to fix this.
According to what Daniel also mentions, there are already several
architectures that use this type of interrupt with a masking/unmasking
implementation, apparantly all without the **need** to masking them.
So, the code must prevent this type of 'misuse' (and thus not
supporting it as it is doing now) or fully support it on RT, just like
on mainline.
So, in short: IMO, only RT is broken, not mainline -> thus fix RT,
otherwise we will have regression compared to mainline.
Kind Regards,
Remy
