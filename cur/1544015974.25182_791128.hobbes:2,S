Yep.  Right now it might be simpler to fix the mainline drivers.
If we can sit down and write some nice clean obviously correct patches
I am all for fixing this bug, possibly even a chipset at a time.
However this is a really weird case and people seem to be really struggling
to understand what is going on and to write those patches.  We are outside
the descriptions provided by ACPI so it requires chipset specific knowledge,
and a general understanding of how chipsets work to actually even comprehend
the problem.
