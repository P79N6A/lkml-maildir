George said he would change the code to meet Linus's issues (re the sub
jiffies stuff).  But there was not much debate either way, and I suspect
George may in fact be correct.
George also offered an interface-only version of the patch that
implements the POSIX clocks and timers syscalls, without the high
resolution support, so it would be nice to at the very least merge the
missing POSIX functionality.
