You said "top -d .1" was 18%, with 11% user, and konsole at 9%.
So that gives:
9% konsole
7% kernel
2% top
0% X server ????
If konsole is well-written, that 9% should drop greatly as konsole
falls behind on a busy system. For example, when scrolling rapidly
it might skip whole screenfuls of data. Hopefully those characters
are rendered in a reasonably efficient way.
