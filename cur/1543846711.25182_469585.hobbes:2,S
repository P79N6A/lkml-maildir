Sangoma's NICs used to work for me..but it seems their latest drivers 
broke the
support that I need.  I think there aren't too many people interested in 
bit-streaming, so
the feature probably doesn't get tested that often...  If I can get the 
digium hardware to
work with a particular zaptel.conf, then I can try Sangoma and see if it 
will work when
configured in that same manner...
Thanks,
