No, 2.0.36 was the last `final' 2.0.xx kernel release. there should be a
2.0.37 when it's various issues get sorted out.

See the Documentation/Changes file in the 2.2.x source tree.
That said, I was able to switch from 2.0.xx to 2.2.xx without breakage
and without package upgrading on my Debian Linux 2.2 system. Debian has
a faster development cycle than other Linux distros though, and there
was work to prepare it for 2.2.x while still in the late 2.1.xxx
kernels. YMMV.
