Many ELF constants are used without direct reference to their 
corresponding structures.  My linux/elf-const.h header is just a 
generalization of the existing linux/elf-em.h header, which just 
contained the ELF EM_* constants.  Given that there seems to be a 
preexisting need for the EM_* constants in a separate header, and having 
a separate elf-*.h for each group of constants is a bad idea, it seemed 
to me that elf-const.h was the appropriate direction to take.
