You need a more recent version of the nfs-utils (former knfsd
package). You can find the latest one on
   
ftp://ftp.linuxnfs.sourceforge.org/pub/nfs
The new program required to start the locking daemon as of
linux-2.2.14 is called rpc.lockd.
Cheers,
  Trond
NB: You will still need to start nfsd and rpc.statd as before...
