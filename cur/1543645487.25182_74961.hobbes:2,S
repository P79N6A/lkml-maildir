Hi Jens,
since your "Cleanup Config.in, and remove unused options" patch the
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_{IDEPCI,GENERIC} configure options look very strange (this
is "make oldconfig"):
<--  snip  -->
  Generic PCI IDE chipset support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI) [Y/n/?]
    Generic PCI IDE Chipset Support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_GENERIC) [N/y/?] (NEW)
<--  snip  -->
Could you fix this?
TIA
Adrian
