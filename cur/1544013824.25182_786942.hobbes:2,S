The compression code is somewhat tied to the btrfs internals, but it
could be pulled out without too much trouble.  The big question there is
if other filesystems are interested in transparent compression support.
But, at the end of the day, most of the work is still done by the zlib
code.  The btrfs bits just organize pages to send down to zlib.
