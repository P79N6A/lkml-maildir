That's really nice because it gives us the opportunity to
look at the major offenders and see if we can fix those,
instead of bloating up the kernel further.

On large machines ZONE_NORMAL is in a big squeeze, so
growing a kernel data structure without any justification
is a big no-no.
I take it you've used /proc/stack to find out what the
major offenders are ?
If so, could you share the list of major offenders with us
so we have an idea which functions to fix ?
(I take it you must have run into some problems, otherwise
you wouldn't have posted the patch)
regards,
Rik
