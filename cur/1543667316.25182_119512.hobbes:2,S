I don't understand the need for this.  It seems to me, upon 
first inspection, to be another one of those "remove the 
code to shave some KB off the kernel source tarball size" 
type of things.  Even if it isn't that, it sure seems like a 
step backwards for linux.  I recall that the whole point of 
devfs was to eliminate the need for userland programs which 
required manual intervention.  It also disturbs me that this 
so-called userspace program provides less 
features/functionality then devfsd did.
Why would I complain?  Simple, devfs has been around for 
awhile, and IMHO has finally started to settle in as 
seasoned means of dealing with /dev.  For instance, we 
encourage our users to use devfs, because it allows us 
greater control and a finer grain of tuning for each users 
profile during boot-up.  It is rather convienient to have a 
silent daemon which handles all the necessary configuration 
in the background.  It's nice to have something which is 
live and can be changed w/o user intervention.  Your change 
would mean that we'd have to rewrite an entire system just 
because you decided that the kernel could do with a few 
hundred less KB.  It isn't just us, either.  I'm sure many 
out there in distro/user land might be at least annoyed 
about the approach you are taking.  There are many other 
reasons why this is not a good idea, most of which Jordan 
seems to have covered, so I will spare repeating them.
The more reasonable approach, at least to me, is the current 
clean up that HCH is doing.  He's reducing the devfs impact 
on the kernel and centralizing it into private source files 
without sacraficing much (if any) compatibility & 
functionality.  Why not work towards this route instead?  At 
the very least, give people a choice as to which 
implementation (big or small) they want use. If you don't 
like it, then don't compile it.  But don't remove it for 
others just to save some piddling space.
So, I advocate strongly that Linus should not apply this 
patch!  Of course, feel free to disagree...
Cheers,
Nicholas
