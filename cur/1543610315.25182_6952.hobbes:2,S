Why do you think that something on the client is 'aware' of the remote
fs?
My guess is that you need to redo your test using a TCP mount for the
Linux machine (that's what your Solaris client is doing). My guess is
that you are hitting a UDP transport reliability problem in the
DirectIO case...

No.
