You can use the following to disable the interrupt debugging: 
Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt:
        noirqdebug      [IA-32] Disables the code which attempts to detect and
                        disable unhandled interrupt sources.
But there is definately something wrong with the driver. Jeff?
