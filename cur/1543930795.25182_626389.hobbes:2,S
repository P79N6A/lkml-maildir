Allright. I don't set CONFIG_ATA_NO_LEGACY on powerpc anyway, as I do
support legacy ATA just fine on a range of machines. 
For example, Pegasos does the a quirk the other way around which is to
put it back the VIA IDE into legacy mode as there are issues with the
way that VIA chipset is configured on those machines.
It's mostly a matter of making sure for me that the IRQ routing match
what the platform code is set to deal with or that sort of thing as
unfortunately, anything that involves legacy stuff is still pretty much
full of hacks.
