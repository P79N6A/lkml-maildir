There are problems in multi-process setups. Say I have one process
which wants to have /dev/repeat return 01010101. I have another
process which wants 00000000, and another which wants 11111111. The
first process writes 01010101 to /dev/repeat. The second writes
00000000. Then the first finally gets around to reading
/dev/repeat. Then the third process writes 11111111, and the second
process reads. Oops. :)
I could be wrong, but it seems that one of the primary uses of
/dev/zero are to mmap it and get copy-on-write pages. Adding different
device objects for different bit patterns doesn't seem too useful to
me.
If you want a particular repeated pattern, use a function like
memfill() from Lars Wirzenius's 'publib' library. If you don't want to
use publib, such a function is easy to write, provided you know the
length of your pattern.
In fact, here's his code:
/*
 * memfill.c -- fill memory area with pattern
 *
 * Part of publib.  See man page for more information
 * "@(#)publib-strutil:$Id: memfill.c,v 1.2 1994/02/05 17:08:42 liw
Exp $"
 */
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>
#include "publib/strutil.h"
void *memfill(void *buf, size_t bufsize, const void *pat, size_t patsize) {
        char *p;
        assert(buf != NULL);
        assert(bufsize > 0);
        assert(pat != NULL);
        assert(patsize > 0);
        assert(!memoverlap(buf, bufsize, pat, patsize));
        for (p = buf; bufsize > patsize; p += patsize, bufsize -= patsize)
                memcpy(p, pat, patsize);
        memcpy(p, pat, bufsize);
        return buf;
}
That code snippet depends on memoverlap(), which is also defined in
that library.
This library is available at
ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/debian/dists/unstable/main/source/libs/publib_0.28.tar.gz.
