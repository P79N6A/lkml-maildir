It would also be interesting to see memory consumption figures for a benchmark 
with many large processes. With this type of load, memory consumption 
through PTEs is already a problem - as far as I can see, rmap triples the 
memory requirement of PTEs through the PTE chain's doubly linked list 
(an additional 8 bytes per entry) ... perhaps my calculations are wrong?  
This is particular problem for databases that tend to have thousands of
processes attatched to a large shared memory area.
A quick rough calculation indicates that the Oracle test I was helping out 
with was consuming almost 10Gb of PTEs without rmap - 30Gb for overhead 
doesn't sound like fun to me ;-(
