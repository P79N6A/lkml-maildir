Why should there be something to prevent that?
If a programmer does that to an ioremapped area, that is a bug.  Pure

We do not need extra mechanisms simply to guard against programmers

I have heard a good argument from rth about creating a pci_ioremap,
which takes a struct pci_dev argument.  But there is no reason to change
the ioremap prototype.
