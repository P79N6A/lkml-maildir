I know that the disk that I'm using has been sitting on a shelf since about last June. It still
seems to be a shipping model though. It's showing itself as model: ST380013AS, rev: 3.18. 
It would be nice if the problem gets fixed someday. Be even nicer if there was a firmware update
that could be applied to the older drives.....
