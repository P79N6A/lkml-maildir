Linus accepted _many_ things in 2.6 ;)

Not only Fs's, the entire vm got replaced and the fact that was made
doesn't mean it was right.
AFAICT, Marcelo isn't taking any decision that would unstabilize the stable
tree. I'm happy with that. He isn't taking other things which are _far_
more importante for people, ALSA for example (drivers that you can just
disable. And it doesn't touch VFS code) and _nobody_ cares abouth that.
(Personally I don't think Marcelo would refuse XFS if it wouldn't touch
the VFS code. The fact that some people think Marcelo is refusing it because
he doesn't likes the code is stupid - he made clear that the problem
is the VFS related part)
Hopefully hch will review it, he will agree that it's
right, or he will find bugs that nobody has triggered with the xfs patches,
and xfs will be merged and all this fscking flame will stop
