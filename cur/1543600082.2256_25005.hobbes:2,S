Hello!
> I hate rebooting :-)
Relax. Really, this will not change anything. After more careful look
into the first tcpdump, I did not find any signs of false fast retransmits.
All the problem is due to wrong rtt estimator at sender.

No. Defaults are defaults, because they are the best defaults. :-)

I do not understand, do you share this link with someone or
ping over tcp connection?
If the last is true, reduce window to 4K, maximum 8K. Default 64K, combined
with misconfigured queues and/or with broken error correction is disaster.
Actually, you dump shows that window is not open.

But I do not see _any_ sacks in your tcpdumps.

It is dominated by rtt, one rtt per segment. It is very strange
that cwnd does not want to open. Maybe, it is worth to tcpdump at proxy.
