This is true.  What I suppose would be the solution is that if faulty
hardware is found, a reduction in performance should be made.  This is
already the case for things like broken PCI BIOS where one can either
set the initialization to work a different way or try to make the
machine autodetect it.  I certainly approve of more effective use of any
given component, but sometimes I think it's better to offer the user a
choice in the case of faulty hardware.
