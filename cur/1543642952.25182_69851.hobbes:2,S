>  o i845G fixes
I just tried 2.4.20-pre6 on my Intel 845GBVL board (845G chipset). 
For the first time DMA is available with the DVD drive, 
without a -ac patch. But UDMA(25) as opposed to UDMA(33) 
with 2.4.20pre5-ac1.Also I got some junk characters in 2.4.20pre6 
when it was probing for IDE devices: 
*****DMESG 2.4.20pre6 snip of the Intel board *****
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
ICH4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev f9
PCI: Device 00:1f.1 not available because of resource collisions
PCI: Found IRQ 5 for device 00:1f.1
PCI: Sharing IRQ 5 with 00:1d.2
GARBAGE CHARACTERS HERE: BIOS setup was incomplete.
ICH4: chipset revision 1
ICH4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xffa0-0xffa7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio

Here is a Dmesg snip of 2.4.20pre5-ac1 on the Intel Board:

***********
2.4.20-pre6 came up fine with my Gigabyte 845IGX (845G chipset)
equipped machine. (Award BIOS as opposed to Intel's). DMA
started to work with 2.4.20-pre5 on this board. The
latest -ac patches do not work on this machine.
Here are full links to the Intel 845GBVL dmesg and lspci:

Thanks! If anyone needs more info, let me know.
