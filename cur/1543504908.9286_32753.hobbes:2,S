But it doesn't work in certain cases and it is not even an optional
"feature". For example, certain programs are not available for Linux
but they are for other UNIXes. So in our company we do a rsh to the
server (OSF/1 4.0) to execute the command there, all automated. This
breaks due to negative dentry caching. Now we always have to patch the
Linux kernel because of this unconditional "feature".
2.2.6-ac3 and other prior versions did not have this behavior and to
my knowledge no other UNIX client currently does (AFAIK only OSF/1 3.2
NFS did something which is even more evil, rendering it *completely*
useless).

To rephrase: The while loop will never find the file if it's too tight (<1
sec).
