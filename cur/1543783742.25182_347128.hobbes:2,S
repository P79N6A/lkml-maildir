I'd be happily surprized to see more documented ADSL PCI/USB device in the
near future. :o(

Ok. Your suggestion may have more impact if there is a patch to convert
the sole existing in-kernel driver to use this module.

An uniform codingstyle is useful when people need to review code. Something
is wrong when a reviewer must uncipher a piece of code. You will find areas
in the kernel whose trends differ but a codingstyle from Mars is usually a
hint. So it is not _only_ a matter of taste.

You may have more feedback/review then. I only gave a cursory look at the
code.

Rather the "typedef struct atmsar_dev atmsar_dev_t;" (yes, I know the "It
saves typing" argument). Maybe something could be done at the same time
regarding the need for the forward declarations.

s/what/why/
And no, documenting a call to skb_reserve is silly.

The value returned by sprintf and friends contains the needed offset, i.e.
buf += sprintf(buf, ...);.

No.
for (), while (), return rc;

OTOH, it makes ugly code to have it fit in a 80 columns console.

atmSend. Probably others.
If you can make the code look like existing in-kernel code (not fs/cifs
please) say network or ata driver code and you do not need goto, it's fine
too.

struct foo zoy {
