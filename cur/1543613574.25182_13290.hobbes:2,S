True, but IMHO only for standard mmap semantics.
Well, the background is slightly different here, but very much the same
problem: I'd like to get rid of some page(s) which are mapped to an
userland vma. At certain points I need to force a page fault on this and
so the overloaded vma->nopage() gets called and can do the right thing.
zap_page_range() does exactly what I want. IMHO zap_page_range() is some
kind of symmetric buddy of remap_page_range() - it's somewhat surprizing
to find one exported but not the other one. And, AFAICS, there is no
technical reason as well, not to use it - at least for me it's working
perfectly fine. Of course it needs proper mm serialization provided by
down_write(&mm->mmap_sem).
