My point was it's better if the driver always check the return
value regardless of which interface is ultimately agreed upon.
(in reference to whether "no one cares a flying fish".)
If one accepts that requirement, the only improvement in Arjen's proposal
is the platform DMA support can guess what might be better and make that
the "effective" mask.  The driver still needs to check the effective mask.
I happen to agree with davem : redefining this interface in 2.5 for
a trivial improvement doesn't seem reasonable at this point.
