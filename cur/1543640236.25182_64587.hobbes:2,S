But of course it would. You can make your own async-io-like things by just 
using clone() directly, that's what all the original clone() users were.

Even from a practical angle, it's not a "global" property. Sure, the code 
that does the clone() itself must have come in through the execve() (or 
through a loadable library later on), so in that sense you can think of it 
as a global thing - since the code must obviously be in the address space 
that the clone thing shares.
But a lot of the clone() decisions can be local, without anythign else 
really knowing about the fact that something started up a thread. The most 
trivial example is simply something like the appended, which just does a 
asynchronous read (yeah yeah, stupid example, but it's basically a 
threaded "cat").
Notice how none of this depends on any global state, so a library could do
the clone() without the caller even knowing that it does part of its work
in a local thread (it obviously wouldn't be doing anything this stupid,
but an async writer thread for sound output etc is not impossible to
imagine in a game library or something like that).
In fact, inside libraries there may well be reasons _not_ to use a global 
threading model like pthreads, because the library might want to take 
advantage of things like separate file descriptor address spaces etc that 
clone() can give it.
