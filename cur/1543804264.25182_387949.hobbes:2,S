Ben,
There' plenty of cases where adding a new notifier chain will be
preferred to adding a long list of if (foo) call() items. One place is
the fork()/exit() path for more system accounting. Being able to sleep
in those places is needed. Fortunately one can do them lock free as
they are in task context, but you need to be able to kmalloc() there.
Cheers,
Jes
