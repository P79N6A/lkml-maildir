After making the kprobe_mutex static, the only alternative we have is to
protect the arch_remove_kprobe (empty on some architectures) call with
kprobe_mutex, which, as Christoph pointed out, is not so great. Besides,
I think the kprobe_insn_mutex would make more sense than taking a mutex
in the arch-specific arch_remove_kprobe() for a resource that is not
clearly identified.
