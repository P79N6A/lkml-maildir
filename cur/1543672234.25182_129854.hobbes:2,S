ABIT IC7-G Main Boards and Linux
Warning! These boards are being shipped without the On-board
Intel CSA Gigabit LAN that is clearly specified in the user-
manual, and in the advertisement on the Web-Page.
Yes, I got ripped off. Also, the AGP slot will not work properly
with the normal AGP video boards like NVIDA GForce, etc. You need
special 1.5V or 0.8V AGP cards (page 2-15 in the manual). The 3.3V
AGP cards will seem to work, but the machine will just STOP, for
no apparent reason at all.
So be forewarned.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
