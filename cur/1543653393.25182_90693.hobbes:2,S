Hmm, I'm not entirely convinced.  Moving back into subdirs introduces
a namespace which isn't really there.  However, as you say, it's
trivial.

I'm actually tempted to push your patch for the moment, since it might
be a week before device ID support is tested and polished enough to go
in, with everything else I am doing.  OTOH, the current method exposes
kernel internals to external userspace programs, which is why I do it
differently.

Yes, it's a fairly obvious optimization: I'd be very interesting in
timing measurements.  Another method is to use
/var/cache/modprobe/`uname-r`.dep and use it if available and more
recent than any module (removes the requirement for depmod).

From the (just posted) FAQ:
Q: Doesn't putting linking code into the kernel just add bloat?
A: The total linking code is about 200 generic lines, 100
   x86-specific lines.  The ia64 linking code is about 500 lines (it's
   the most complex).  Richard Henderson has a great suggestion for
   simplifying it furthur, which I'm implementing now.  "insmod" is
   now a single portable system call, meaning insmod can be written in
   about 20 lines of code.
   The previous code had to implement the two module loading
   system calls, the module querying system call, and the /proc/ksyms
   output, required a little more code than the current x86 linker.
Q: Why not just fix the old code?
A: Because having something so intimate with the kernel in userspace
   greatly restricts what changes the kernel can make.  Moving into
   the kernel means I have implemented modversions, typesafe
   extensible module parameters and kallsyms without altering
   userspace in any way.  Future extensions won't have to worry about
   the version of modutils problem.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty,
