What I suggested to Intel at the Developer Days is to have a MSR (or, 
better yet, a bit in the page table pointer %cr0) that disables "lock" in 
_user_ space. Ie a lock would be a no-op when in CPL3, and only with 
certain processes.
The kernel really isn't that critical. We always need the locks in SMP 
(unlike user space, which never needs them if the process isn't threaded), 
and in the kernel space we occasionally need it even with UP to protect 
against devices. And we _can_ do these instruction rewrites, and they are 
even pretty trivial for the non-hotplug case.
User space is actually a lot more important. People spend more time in 
user space, and there the lock prefix is much more often totally useless 
and cannot just be edited away once per boot.
