Yeah it has "affine wakeups" now, which will do that for all
types of wakeups, and not just to idle CPUs either (sync
wakeups just get pulled a little more strongly).
IIRC SGI reported something like a factor 8 improvement in
CPU efficiency on a database IO simulation on a smallish
system (16-way maybe).
