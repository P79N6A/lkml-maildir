Why not?
Letting the build system select a default target is often a
better choice than some random choice by a developer.

Not discussing different platforms, only discussing kernel targets.
For arm I see the following:
zImage, Image bootpImage uImage
And some test targets: zImg, Img, bp, i, zi
Not counting the test targets it is only 4 target of which 3 is
documented in help today.

Maybe Wolgang can jump in here - I do not know why mkimage is needed.
But I do like to have it present for convinience.
It is btw called mkuboot.sh in scripts/ to better say what it does.
