Unfortunately, no.  You have to use the same offsets as the in-kernel
DEFINE_PER_CPU declarations, meaning that each cpu's stuff needs to be
"sizeof kernel per-cpu-section" apart.
Which means an allocator which keeps a linked list of NR_CPUS * sizeof
kernel-per-cpu-section things, and allocs and frees from that.
Hence this patch just tacks it on the end of the module, rather than
deal with an allocator.  A minor improvement would be only to allocate
for the maximum possible CPU, which means about 6k * numcpus per
module which declares per-cpu data, which is probably fine.
Rusty.
