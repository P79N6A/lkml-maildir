Sure.  But I wasn't proposing this as a way to make slub cover slob's advantage.
I was wondering what effect it would have on a more typical medium to large sized
system.
Not much, really: if any particular subsystem is using a "lot" of slab memory then
it should create its own cache rather than using kmalloc anyway, so forget it ;)
