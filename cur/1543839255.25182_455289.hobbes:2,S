Actually, the NFS client has several different styles, and mine's not without
precedent, eg:
extern int nfs3_setxattr(struct dentry *, const char *,
			const void *, size_t, int);
extern ssize_t nfs_direct_IO(int, struct kiocb *, const struct iovec *, loff_t,
			unsigned long);
static inline loff_t
nfs_size_to_loff_t(__u64 size)

Depends how much you want to upset those people who tremble with anxiety at
the sight of a line longer than 80 chars.
