Powering off invokes the BIOS. BIOSen are known to have bugs.
You really should check if a BIOS update is available.

Your APM/ACPI config seems Ok, but what does CONFIG_SMP look like?
Enabling SMP disables APM's power off code, unless one boots with
apm=power-off.
Did your kernel have to actually enable the local APIC, or did
the BIOS boot us with it already enabled? Please send me a dmesg
from a boot with local APIC support enabled.
I can't seem to find any place where we disable the local APIC
on shutdown; reboot seems Ok but not poweroff (as far as I can see).
I think this might explain why some BIOSen hang at poweroff.
