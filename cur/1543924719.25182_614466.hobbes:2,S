I suspect all we need is an offset-pointer field pointing into the 
kernel image.  As far as the kernel build process is concerned, it 
becomes a section in the boot/compressed link script.  That offset then 
needs to get exported to the setup.elf link stage and there adjusted to 
become a file offset.
The ELF note format is sane enough, although it looks like it's not 
self-terminating, so we'd either need an offset and a length field, or 
adopt the convention that namesz = descsz = type = 0 terminates the 
block (I prefer the latter, myself.)  We also need the notes documented, 
obviously.
