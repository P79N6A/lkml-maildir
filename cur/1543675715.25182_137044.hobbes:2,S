Subject: 2.5.70 and 2.5.70-mm3 hang on bootup

Both 2.5.70 and 2.5.70-mm3 hang right after "Ok, booting the kernel..." on 
one of my test boxes (at the point, nothing works, not even turning on/off 
the NumLock LED).
Hardware: ASUS A7S333, Athlon 2600+, 1 GB RAM
Compiler: gcc 3.3
Haven't had the time to debug this yet (and probably won't have the time 
for a couple more days, busy with work ATM); any ideas?
