Hi Mark,
> Is someone actively working on USB Suspend/Resume support yet?
I've got some patches that need refreshing and splitting-out that
don't seem like 2.6.14 material in the "new world", but maybe a
few of them are.
There are also a handful of EHCI and OHCI fixes pending for 2.6.14
which aren't in Greg's latest batch, some of which affect USB PM.
I understand they'll get into the MM tree soon.

That's strange.  For me it's been closer to the other way around,
except that things never crash for me.  Something tells me your
hardware and/or BIOS is different...
Some of the PM and usbcore changes have been tweaking assumptions;
which of course makes some of the more sensitive code paths unhappy.

I don't know that anyone's looking specifically at the issue that
the HID (mouse) driver has; I'm not.
If your system behaves OK without that mouse connected, it ought
to be easy to fix that one bug.  If not, forward details to
linux-usb-devel (separate thread).
