Hi @ all!
I need some Information:
I'm currently developing the the wireless functions for the rtl8180
chipset.
There's only one problem:
I don't know how to perform a wireless scan.
How does it work?
Is there an algorithm or a GPL based driver which does this well?
I'm happy about any help.
Thanks
Matthias-Christian Ott
