It would have send an event over attached opened file.  Attached at
creation time.

Or if passed event contains opened mountpoint-to-be.

Vetoed.  ioctl() is _not_ an acceptable way to implement any generic
functionality.  It basically says "my interface is a garbage".
And yes, we need to think about a new syscall for mount-related
work.  With sane API - mount(2) one is _not_.  sys_mount() would
still stay, obviously.
