For SD cards we can also use the RCA, which tends to be a bit random.
Perhaps a generic hash function so that we can extend and tweak this
algorithm in one place?

I can't say that I approve of this code. It's my firm belief that
drivers that are protocol aware are horribly broken.

Sounds like a much better solution. Hacking around problems instead of
solving them usually lead to even more problems.
I haven't studied all drivers in detail, but I believe all of them
should be able to handle the transistion.
