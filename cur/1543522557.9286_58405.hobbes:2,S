	So put such a system behind a ``firewall'' (which does not
	necessarily mean expensive things, perhaps just IP ACL at
	the network egress router) and divert all incoming email to
	do so via a bastion server by means of MX records.  Trivial.
	If you don't want to construct such bastion yourself, ask
	your ISP to act as such, and do router ACL blocking to
	limit incoming SMTP connectivity from your ISP's server
	network.

	If the receiving server is vulnerable to things like:
		<"foo@somewhere.com"@receiver.com>
	these ISP bastions don't help, as ISP can't analyze
	that the address in the local part is a cocoos egg..
	(Same *may* also harm self-kept fw/bastions.)
