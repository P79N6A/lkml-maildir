 1.2 Kernel data
 ---------------
 
 Similar to  the  process entries, the kernel data files give information about
 the running kernel. The files used to obtain this information are contained in
-/proc and  are  listed  in Table 1-3. Not all of these will be present in your
+/proc and  are  listed  in Table 1-4. Not all of these will be present in your
 system. It  depends  on the kernel configuration and the loaded modules, which
 files are there, and which are missing.
