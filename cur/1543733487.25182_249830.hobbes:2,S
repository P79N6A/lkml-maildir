Hopefully we can ;-) Or does anyone use it? There are not that much
userspace programs in any way interacting with the kernel cryptoapi...

This is a compile time thing, e.g. something like:
	.cia_min_keysize = 1,
	.cia_max_keysize = 128
for variable keysizes, and
	.cia_keysizes = { 128, 192, 256, -1 }
for discrete keysizes.
typeof(cia_keysizes) would be "int[]".

I didn't know about such a rule. If it is that strict we could have a
subdir modules with a node for each module (aes, aes_i586, padlock, ...)
and a symlink (are symlinks allowed in sysfs?) default pointing to the one
with highest preference.
Attached is my patch introducing preferences for current cryptoapi. How
can this be done with the kobject model?
- During registration the kobject for a given algo should be looked up. If
found (i.e. there already is a module loaded) the new module would be
somehow "attached" to it. If not found a new kobject for the algo would be
created and then the first module attached to it.
- During lookup the kobject for a requested algo will be further examined
and the "struct crypto_alg" of the most preferenced module will be
returned.
Could this be done? (I don't know too much about sysfs and kobjects).
