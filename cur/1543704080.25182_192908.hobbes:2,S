FYI module_parm is just a convenience wrapper around
	module_param_call(name, set, get, arg, perm)
Where get and set are the callbacks:
	/* Returns 0, or -errno.  arg is in kp->arg. */
	typedef int (*param_set_fn)(const char *val, struct kernel_param *kp);
	/* Returns length written or -errno.  Buffer is 4k (ie. be short!) */
	typedef int (*param_get_fn)(char *buffer, struct kernel_param *kp);
With these the implementation should be fairly neat.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
