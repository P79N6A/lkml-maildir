This discussion came up earlier, with Bastian and Roland and my understanding
was that we should fix the SigIgn line in /proc/pid/status - so I had added
a TODO for this patchset.

But it is ignored right ?
Also, if user space looks at the SigIgn line and assumes that SIGKILL or
SIGUSR1 will kill init, user space can still be confused when it doesn't
really kill - no ?

You are right that its not strictly tied to this patchset. init was
dropping SIGKILL before too.
So, should I just post separately or drop altogether ?
