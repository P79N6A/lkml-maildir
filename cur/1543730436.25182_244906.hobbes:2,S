So, correct me if I'm wrong, you want this price to be paid at *every* 
context switch, isn't it? Independently from the fact that the task does 
or does not I/O operations.

It was in the lazy FPU code ;) and this patch is utterly simple and sets 
the most restrictive policy, by later verifying in the GPF code. It does 
not leave stale bitmaps from previous tasks in search of optimizations.

Apps that do use I/O a lot will likely issue more than one I/O per context 
switch, and the cost of even one I/O op will be greater than the GPF cost. 
This w/out even accounting the cost saved on context switches where no I/O 
is done. Talking about X for example, yesterday test (that I should better 
confirm today) revealed that more than 60% of context switches do *not* 
trigger the GPF fault, that is, for in 60+% of context switches X does not 
use I/O operations. This is not a surprise given the way the X server works.

Personally Ingo, I do not like logics like:
if (io_apps <= 1) pretty_good(); then screwed();
But that's just a matter of personal taste. Anyway, today I'll recode with 
Brian get/put_cpu suggestion and on top of var-bitmap bits, and I'll 
repost. Then if you guys like it you take it, otherwise we keep the 
current memcpy/memset on switch_to.
