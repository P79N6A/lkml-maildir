Hi,
With both 2.6.0-test1 and test2 I am unable to use
de pipe (|) key in textmode (??). When in X it works again.
I have tested this on 2 machines. One machine is a laptop with Japanese
keyboard the other a regular PC with wireless Logitech USB keyboard.
All the other keys seem to work properly...anyone else with this strange
problem?
Greetings,
Jurgen
