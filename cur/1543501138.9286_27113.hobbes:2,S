Why all this complexity. Leave a camera on the desk, and take a picture
when
the big moment comes (try a fast film, a fairly slow exposure and a
steady
hand - the picture should be pretty readable from experience). No serial
cables, no time consuming configuration, no errors when writing things
down
quickly, no delays in booting.
