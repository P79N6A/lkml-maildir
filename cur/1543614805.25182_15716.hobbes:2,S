You certainly don't need a server process.   And as was pointed out
earlier, it's nice not to have them, then you don't have to worry 
about them still being there.
I can write you up a multi writer version using in file locks (which
work over NFS, we had do that for BK and I'm pretty sure it is platform
independent, I can't break it).  We have to do this sort of multi
reader/writer crud in BK all the time and have lots of experience with
locking, breaking locks, waiting, NFS, etc.  Much more experience than
we ever wanted :-)
You don't need to sync to disk at all, let the data sit in memory, that's
why mmap is cool.
Give me a spec for what you want, I'll crank out some code.  Maybe I'll 
finally actually be useful to the kernel after all these years...
