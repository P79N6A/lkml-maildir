and in this specific sched.c case, are we going to put in magic comments
every 25 lines inbetween:
/* this is CONFIG_SMP conditional code */
just to save us some scrolling up? I dont think #endif is special wrt.  
such comments.
in header files the #ifdef jungle often makes proper nesting hard. In
those cases putting comments to #else and #endif makes a real difference
in readability. But in sched.c there is not a single nested #ifdef. (and
that's very much intentional.)
