The advice was not quite correct. You should tell kernel that
192.168.1.0 is _not_ broadcast, because all the packets with broadcast
source are unconditionally dropped.
You can make this with ip (ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/iproute2-*):
ip route del broadcast 192.168.1.0
BTW could you tell me (for database of bogons), what firmware
sends bogus packets, and what kind of packets it sends.
