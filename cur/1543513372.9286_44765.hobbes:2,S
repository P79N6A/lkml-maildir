Well, I have recently changed machine at work from Compaq DeskPro 5100 to
Compaq DeskPro EN 6450 and OS from RedHat Linux 4.2 to RedHat Linux 6.0;
Both systems are IDE, but with PD-CD connected to BusLogic SCSI;
While my previous system behaved normal when writing to PD, the new one
was completely unusable during write (I was not even able to switch
between screens on X);
Then I went to BIOS settings and changed PCI Busmastering enable
option from default NO to YES (and also disabled serial 2, so I had a
separate IRQ for SCSI card); After this change the system work quite well
during transfers to PD.
I am not sure how much relevant it is to your problems, but as symptoms
were similar, I thought I would post this.
Best regards,
Wojtek
