It's possible that there are better fixes for this, but at least
my simple patch seems to work here. I admit I was banging my
head against this for some time and when I did the fix I just
wanted the bug to go away and didn't really go for subtleness.
The bootmem allocator is quite spaghetti in fact, it could
really need some general clean up (although it's' not quite
as bad yet as page_alloc.c)
