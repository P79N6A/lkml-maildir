Define "using", as long as the count is different from the cpuset is 
active and the possible actions on it are limited.

No, as long as you own the cpuset (i.e. increased count) no one else can 
take it away from you (without proper locking). So once you get the 
locking right, the rest will fall in place. :-)

But you take task_lock currently, which is replaced by the new spinlock.
In general _any_ access to tsk->cpuset is protected by the spinlock.
