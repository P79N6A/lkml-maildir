Subject: linux-2.4 bitkeeper repository not up to date
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The repository linux24.bkbits.net is only at 2.4.19-pre3; however, the kernel 
test directory is at 2.4.19-pre4.  I seem to remember that when we had this 
problem with the 2.5 repository it was a scripting issue.
Anyway, could someone with access to the relevant sites fix it?
Thanks,
James Bottomley
