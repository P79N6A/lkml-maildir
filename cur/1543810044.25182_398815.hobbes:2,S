I tried to play with mpg123 using OSS emulation, so that it does not
have anything to do with ALSA. No luck. Trying aplay:
root@hobit:/dev/snd#  aplay
/usr/share/xemacs21/xemacs-packages/etc/sounds/hammer.wav
aplay: main:533: audio open error: No such file or directory
while stracing:
open("/dev/snd/pcmC0D0p", O_RDWR)       = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
close(3)                                = 0
write(2, "aplay: main:533: ", 17aplay: main:533: )       = 17
write(2, "audio open error: No such file o"..., 43audio open error: No
such file or directory) = 43
write(2, "\n", 1
... but pcmC0D0p is not described in devices.txt...?
