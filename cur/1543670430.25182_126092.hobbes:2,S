Dave, I recall reading there are problems with building an ext2 initrd
because of the small size, and it seems that ext3 is fine at the moment.
Just try to tweak the initrd script to do a ext3 (add -j to the mke2fs).
Search for "Recent changes broke mkinitrd" on lkml for more details.
Greets, Antonio.
ps. I'm having problems running make menuconfig under gnome-terminal,
    and so filled a bugreport on bugzilla.redhat.com
    xterm works fine at least
