Hi Andi,
	For the IDE oopser, I used the 16-bit size trick and a very
simple static huffman encoding, which IIRC brought the size down to
~100k (I can't find numbers at the moment).  I relied on a linked-list
of tables (for things which were more than 16 bits apart), which is
not such a great idea for the kallsyms table.  Maybe eliminate
aliases, and then use a 0 size to prefix a full new pointer?
Anyway, here's the post if you're interested:

Cheers,
Rusty.
