I am trying to run a DC21040 in full duplex mode.  The driver says to
compile the driver with a define in the .c file.  I did this and I don't
think it is functioning correctly.  When I enable Full Duplex on my switch
the transfer rate drops to 80K/sec from 800K/sec...   Any hints?  Also,
could this be made into a command line lilo option?  I usualy keep my
kernel fairly non-modular becuase I ahven't totaly figured out
conf.modules and switching between kernel versions.  Maybe someone can
point me to better Module howto files...  all of the ones I have found are
for seting up basic things.  I always have problems like modularizing
filesystems and it doesn't auto detect fs types because the module is not
loaded and so on...  I have just never found good documentation on it...
Especaily the new kernel based loader.
