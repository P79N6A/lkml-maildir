fdisk/format and reinstall but stick with a 2.4.19 or 2.4.19-ac kernel.
I would bet money that the problem is purely a .20-preX-acX thing.
run it a while on 2.4.19 to verify that life is good.  then build a new 
2.4.20-pre1-ac3 and boot it. I bet that within minutes of normal use, you 
will have a problem.
(I have done this loop 3 times.)
