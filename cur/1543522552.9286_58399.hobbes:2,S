Correct, the first paragraph above is a thinko.  Please see followup
where I retract it.

Now you're thinking about GCC, not the ISO C standard.  In ISO C, sign
bits don't exist (not every machine does signed arithmetic with 2's
complement -- rounded floating point is possible for example), and the
shift you described leads to undefined behaviour.
Even real compilers don't always sign extend signed right shifts.

GCC and probably most C compilers do that but it is not guaranteed by C
in general.  Maybe all known x86 compilers use sar.  However, I am sure
there have been C compilers that donn't use arithmetic shifts.  If only
I could remember which ones :-)
