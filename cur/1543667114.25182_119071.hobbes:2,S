Hi,
2.5.65 doesn't connect to my network via my network card:
00:0b.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c905 100BaseTX [Boomerang]
My switch does show a link, but the dhcpcd negotiation fails, and no activity 
is shown.
All kernel logs look normal, no errors, card is detected correctly.
My configuration is attached.
