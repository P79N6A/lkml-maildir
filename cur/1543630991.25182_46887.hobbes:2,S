Well, not everybody trusts "make install" to do something useful.
I'd do something like this:
make clean
bzip2 -dc ../foo.bz2 | patch -E -s -p1
make menuconfig
time script build-log
make vmlinux && make modules && make modules_install && exit
cp vmlinux /boot/vmlinux-2.5.16
cp System.map /boot/System.map-2.5.16
cp .config /boot/config-2.5.16
sync
su -
joe /etc/yaboot.conf
sync
exit
-
