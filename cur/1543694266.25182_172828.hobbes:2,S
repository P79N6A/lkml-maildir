Subject: [PATCH] tmpfs 4/7 getpage/truncate race
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Extend use of that SHMEM_PAGEIN flag to where shmem_getpage adds a page
to the cache.  It couldn't have caused a BUG_ON(inode->i_blocks), but if
i_size is reduced (from another cpu) the instant after shmem_swp_alloc
checks it, shmem_getpage could insert a page into the cache just after
truncate_inode_pages has passed through cleaning it, leaving stale data
(which may mysteriously reappear if the file is later extended).
Easily fixed for tmpfs, using the mechanism just added for swapoff; and
probably more important there, since its read from swap can insert non-0
data.  But is there not a similar issue, a tiny window, in filemap.c?
if truncate_inode_pages comes in between checking i_size and adding new
page to cache.  Not worth getting excited, but something to beware of.
