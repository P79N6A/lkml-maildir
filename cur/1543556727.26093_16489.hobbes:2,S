Why is double_fault serviced by a trap gate? The problem with this is that
any double-fault caused by a stack-fault, which is the usual reason,
becomes a triple-fault. And a triple-fault results in a processor reset or
shutdown making the fault damn near impossible to get any information on.
Oughtn't the double-fault exception handler be serviced by a task gate? And
similarly the NMI handler in case the NMI is on the current stack page
frame?
