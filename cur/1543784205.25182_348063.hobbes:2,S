To kill a kernel thread, you need to make __it__ call exit(). It must be
CODED to do that! You can't do it externally although you can send
it a signal, after which it will spin forever....
// Main loop of the thread
     for(;;)
     {
         set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
         if(signal_pending(current))
             complete_and_exit(&info->quit, 0);  // <--- HERE!!!
         interruptible_sleep_on(&info->twait);
         do_work();
     }
// Start a thread
     info->pid = kernel_thread(local_thread, NULL, CLONE_FS|CLONE_FILES);
// Stop a thread
     if(info->pid)
     {
         (void)kill_proc(info->pid, SIGTERM, 1);
         wait_for_completion(&info->quit);   // MUST wait!
     }
With newer kernels, we use the allow_signal(SIGNAME) macro as one
of the first things executed to allow the kernel thread to respond
to a signal.

I apologize for the following. I tried to kill it with the above dot :
