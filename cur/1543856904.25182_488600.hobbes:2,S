I only have 32-bit userspace.  When I run your program against
a directory on a JFS filesystem (msdos ioctls not supported)
I get this on vanilla 2.6.19:
$ ./vfat_ioctl32.ex .
268 : 82187201, 82187202
268 : 82187201, 82187202
Calling VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH32
ioctl: Invalid argument
Calling VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH
ioctl: Invalid argument
After reverting the msdos compat ioctls patch it changes to:
$ ./vfat_ioctl32.ex .
268 : 82187201, 82187202
268 : 82187201, 82187202
Calling VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH32
ioctl: Inappropriate ioctl for device
Calling VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH
ioctl: Inappropriate ioctl for device

I get those messages when the ioctl call returns 'invalid argument.'
In fs/compat.s::compat_sys_ioctl() you can see it changing the
return value after it prints the message:
                static int count;
                if (++count <= 50)
                        compat_ioctl_error(filp, fd, cmd, arg);
                error = -EINVAL;
So apparently this is a feature?
