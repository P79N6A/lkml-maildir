Sorry for writing back so late , for something interrupted me.
I have one 3c509B installed on a PC. While booting , the kernel(2.2.5-12)
displays the following message:
...
3c509.c:1.16 (2.2) 2/3/98  becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov.
eth0:  Setting Rx mode to 1 addresses.
...
but I clearly remember I've seen somewhere these messages: " erh0: Setting Rx
mode to 2 address."
or " eth0: Setting Rx mode to 3 addresses"
I want to know what makes the difference.
What's more, here we have some 3c508 cards, but no driver is avilable in
Redhat 6.0.
Could you help me find the proper driver?
Thanks.
