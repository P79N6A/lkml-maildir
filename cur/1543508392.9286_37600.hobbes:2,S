I may be wrong here, but I believe that modem falls into the category
generally referred to as "WinModems". A quick check would be to look
for a "Minimum System Specification" on the box, as a non-winmodem
shouldn't need one but a WinModem inevitably does.

No idea, but I doubt it.

The usual complaint against WinModems is that the manufacturers will
NOT release the specs to the Linux community, with the result that any
driver development has to start by reverse engineering the product to
find out how it works...

Sounds about right...
Best wishes from Riley.
