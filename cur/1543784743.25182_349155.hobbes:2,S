Actually, I took another look at this matter and I now think that you
had the correct approach.
The rebuild speed is the speed at which the new disk is being built, not
the total rebuild i/o. This means that it does not contain the read
operations. So the PCI limit is a limiting factor. On a 32-bit 33MHz PCI
controller (132MB/s theoretical bandwidth) a 2->3 rebuild cannot be
faster 44MB/s and a 3->4 is limited to 33MB/s.
I think this is true.
The same limit will also apply to any raid i/o as we read/write to all
the disks for any data.
To use 5 60MB/s disks I will need 300MB/s bandwidth which a 64-bit 66MHz
PCI can deliver. A 32-bit/66MHz will come close - what can PCIe do?.
A proper RAID card will alleviate the PCI limitation as it will have
dedicated channels for each disk (well, a good controller should) with
full bandwidth and the PCI will only need to go at the one-disk speed
(for raid-5).
On-board SATA controllers will have better bandwidth if they sit on a
better than PCI bus (or on more than one PCI bus).
