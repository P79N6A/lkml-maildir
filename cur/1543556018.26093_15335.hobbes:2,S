On a totally unrelated to the resourcesnote, for your benefit, Jan:
the ->user->uid is maintained for a reason completely different from your
usage above (see kernel/user.c to learn why -- it is to easily find out
given user_struct which real uid it belongs to in uid_hash_find()). If you
wanted this process' uid you should have used p->uid. If you wanted this
process' effective uid (more likely) then you should have used p->euid.

Tigran
