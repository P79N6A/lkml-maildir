Human reason needs only to will more strongly than fate, and she is fate.Do not be afraid of defeat. You are never so near to victory as when defeated in a good cause.
The modern sympathy with invalids is morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.
Our will is always for our own good, but we do not always see what that is.
