Subject: [BUG] compile error in 2.4.19-pre5-ac1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

  init/do_mounts.c uses SCHED_YIELD, which seems no longer defined
although grep tells me it's heavily used in non-Intel code. I noted that
yield() is back, defined via an asmlink, so I replaced the SCHED_YIELD and
schedule()  loop with a call to yield(). I also include linux/sched.h
which may not have been needed but avoided trying a compile without.
  No patch, I'm not sure if defining SCHED_YIELD in sched.h would have
been the better fix, or would even work, but this worked, I built my
initrd file, and it all booted correctly several times (and is up as I
type).
  Note of warning to new Redhat users, for some reason /usr/include/linux
is a directory instead of a symbolic link to /usr/src/linux/include/linux,
so changes in includes aren't used. Possibly an artifact of the install on
that system, but something to note.
