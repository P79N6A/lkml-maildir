Yes serio and gameport (which I am planning to convert to driver model as well)

I have been looking at it entire weekend and I do not presently see a way to
make this facility truly generic. That is because pretty much all buses
perform additional steps besides code in driver->remove() which driver core
does is not aware of. What is needed it bus->device_disconnect function that
would disconnect device and probably destroy all children.
For now I added:
- "driver" default device attribute that produces name of currently bound
  driver uppon read.
- bus->rebind_handler method that is called when someone writes to "driver"
  attribute and allows to perform bunctions like disconnecting device or
  rebinding it to alternative driver in bus-specific way.
- "bind_mode" default device and driver attributes that can be "auto" or
  "manual". When device or driver marked as manual bind device_attach()
  and driver_attach() will ignore them. They are expected to be bound by
  bus->rebind_handler (via driver_probe_device()).
I also renamed bus_match to driver_probe_device() and exported it, along
with device_attach and driver_attach.
Please let me know if its acceptable.
The patches are suitable for importing with bkimport utility (by Bjorn
Helgaas?) that allows preserve per-file comments.
