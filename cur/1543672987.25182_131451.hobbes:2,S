Yes.  Note that the names 'lan' and 'internet' in the example
are name of possible configurations, not "physical" interface names.
They are only used by the ifupdown package; they do not show up
in an "ifconfig" listing.  Thus, doing "ifup eth0=home-wireless-1"
brings up interface eth0 in the home-wireless-1 configuration.
What implements the ability to work in terms of MAC addresses is the
mapping script /path/to/get-mac-addr.sh.  When, e.g., eth0 comes up,
get-mac-addr.sh scans for the MAC address and outputs either the
name 'lan' or the name 'internet'; ifupdown then configures eth0
with either the "lan" configuration or the "internet" configuration.
(The configurations are called "logical interfaces" in the ifupdown
documentation.)
