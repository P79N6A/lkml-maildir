I've had less than terribly good luck with the i2o pci driver on these 
things. the promise pti_st  driver does working fairly well. tweaking the 
bios and playing with firmware versions was pretty hit-or-miss with the 
sx6000. for consistencys sake we just went with the promise module accross 
all our sx6000 using machines.
