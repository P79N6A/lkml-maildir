Subject: dumb 2.3.18ac2 question on vmlinux.lds

There's obviously something I'm not understanding here.  I used the
2.3.18ac2 patch on a clean 2.3.18 tree (patch -p1 < patch-2.3.18ac2) and
got told it was trying to make a new file called arch/i386/vmlinux.lds
which already existed.  Running make mrproper gets rid of that file and
lets the patch run cleanly.  Here's the confusing part to me:  The
README file says to patch your kernel, then run make mrproper.  But if I
do that it gets rid of the file the patch just created.  Could someone
hit me with the cluestick on this one?
