This will deadlock if work->func() does flush_workqueue(), because it may
run when _cpu_down() holds this lock (note that it doesn't help if we
re-introduce take_over_work()).
This is a reason why mutex_lock(&workqueue_mutex) was removed from
flush_workqueue().

We can freeze all tasks :) Otherwise we can't forbid them to call
flush_workqueue().
flush_workqueue() is OK. create/destroy is a problem.
