Release 0.6.0: Sun Jul  2 00:53:39 EDT 2000
	* Abolished the configsymbol lexical class.
	* Rulebase corrections for HP300 by Tamminen Eero.
	* Don't croak on a malformed -i or -I file.
	* Fixed bugs in curses mode g and / commands.
Another simplification in the language.  The practical implication is that
configuration symbols could begin with small letters now, if we wanted that.

"...The Bill of Rights is a literal and absolute document. The First
Amendment doesn't say you have a right to speak out unless the
government has a 'compelling interest' in censoring the Internet. The
Second Amendment doesn't say you have the right to keep and bear arms
until some madman plants a bomb. The Fourth Amendment doesn't say you
have the right to be secure from search and seizure unless some FBI
agent thinks you fit the profile of a terrorist. The government has no
right to interfere with any of these freedoms under any circumstances."
