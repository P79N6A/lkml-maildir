My problem turns out to be an apparently undocumented requirement that the
family type must be set in the buffer for SIOCGIFADDR to work (but not for
the mask or broadcast commands to work) and if you don't (i.e. all bytes 0)
it will return the last four bytes of the network card's MAC address but set
this byte (the 18th, at offset 17) to 1 which will cause it to work the
next time.
