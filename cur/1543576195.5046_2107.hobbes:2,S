Hi
Ive been working on getting the wireless modem from novatel work with my
linux box.
I see that all incoming ip packets larger than 450 bytes get corrupted ..the
last two bytes (checksum) goes missing when it reaches the ppp driver..
if the packet is less than that (450 bytes ) everything is fine .
Ive not been able to isolate the problem to the card or the serial driver
The  card works very well with windows and mac
Im using kernel 2.2.16 with pcmcia version 3.1.8 
thanks
