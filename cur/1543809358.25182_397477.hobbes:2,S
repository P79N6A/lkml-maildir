Ah, I referred to the CKRM e- series controller as "existing controller"
and referred to the controller that I had sent as "a new CPU resource 
controller."
So, the controller that I had sent is the existing controller of
f- series.
Sorry for confusion,

Thanks for the clarification.
I was actually confused by the words "This patchset adds a CPU resource
controller for CKRM" in the earlier mail. I thought this is some new
controller..
Currently I have downloaded cpurc_v0.3-2614 and plan to look in to it
for understanding CKRM. Later I guess I can catch up with the current
changes that you are making..
