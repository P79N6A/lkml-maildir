Subject: traffic shaper in 2.4.18 working?

(initial conditions)
I have two existing IP addresses on eth0 belonging to the same subnet as a
virtual host.  This machine is a dual CPU box at 450MHz with an Intel
EtherPro 100.
(what I've done)
I've executed:
shapecfg attach shaper0 eth0
shapecfg speed shaper0 19000
ifconfig shaper0 10.0.0.80
However, it seems whenever I subsequently connect to this
machine's 10.0.0.80 from another machine, it still transmits at full
bandwidth of the media and not the 19K (Bytes/sec?) that I expect?
Is this a proper usage of this device or is it a bug?
Thanks,
-bc
