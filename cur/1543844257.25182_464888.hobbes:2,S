No. djprobes already does safely insert other stuff than just
int3, that's the whole point.
Here are the relevant postings by Hiramatsu-san:

Unless there's something *I* fundamentally misunderstood from
Hiramatsu-san's implementation and input, djprobes can replace
the 5-byte filler with a 5-byte unconditional jump. IOW your
mechanism works, no int3s involved.
