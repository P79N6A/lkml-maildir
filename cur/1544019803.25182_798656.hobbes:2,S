But which kernel version are you looking to get this merged into?

yeah, I often do that.  If I see nothing fatal in the patch I'll merge
it so that it gets a bit of testing and so that it doesn't get
forgotten about.  Especially if it's a bugfix.
Sometimes I'll send a reply and the originator goes to sleep for weeks,
and stuff could even get lost.  I hate losing stuff.  I'll mark the patch
as "needs an update" in the series file so I don't accidentally merge it
upstream.

Sure, when convenient.
