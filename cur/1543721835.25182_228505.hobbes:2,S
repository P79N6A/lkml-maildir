Yes, this is the way it was designed.  The thinking was that a device
would be registered to a driver by the time the class code was
initialized for it.

The sd use of classes is a monumental hack.  So much that every time I
see one of them in the hall at work I run the other way just to avoid
talking about it again :)
No, seriously, if this is a problem for the sd driver, we should fix it.

Yes, that is a recent change.

The symlink should be removed by the class, right?

Hm, I was not wanting to have to have struct device know about classes,
only classes knowing about struct devices.  Any input here would be
appreciated.
