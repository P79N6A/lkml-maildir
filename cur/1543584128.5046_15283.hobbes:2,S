Unfortunatly I entered this command remotely. The console Display was
off at that time.

I would not really like to do that, as of now everything runs fine again for a day.

After the first crash I needed to reboot. It crashed again shortly after
boot message that it starts to resync.
This happens several times until I used the kernel parameter MAXcpus=1.
Then it worked without a problem. After resyncing finished I could start
it again in SMP mode and everything worked fine again.
Sorry that can not shed any more light on it.
