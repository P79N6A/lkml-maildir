+/**
+ * Ridr synchronization (see radix-tree.h)
+ *
+ * ridr_find() is able to be called locklessly, using RCU. The caller must
+ * ensure calls to this function are made within rcu_read_lock() regions.
+ * Other readers (lock-free or otherwise) and modifications may be running
+ * concurrently.
+ *
+ * It is still required that the caller manage the synchronization and
+ * lifetimes of the items. So if RCU lock-free lookups are used, typically
+ * this would mean that the items have their own locks, or are amenable to
+ * lock-free access; and that the items are freed by RCU (or only freed after
+ * having been deleted from the ridr tree *and* a synchronize_rcu() grace
+ * period).
