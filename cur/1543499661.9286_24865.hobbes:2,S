You know, I don't know a whole lot about the internals of an operating
system... but I do believe that you have to be crazy to think that you can
change the *core* of an OS and not reboot it... Think about it.  You can't
do that with a user-level program, the exact reason escapes my mind now,
but it has to do with how the memory is mapped during execution.
The OS is nothing but a user level program from the CPU's view instead of
the user's view.  (That's not exactly what I mean to say, but I think I
convey my idea... that's the best way I can think of to describe it at the
moment.)  You have to restart that program if you want to change it.
