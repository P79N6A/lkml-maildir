Yes, it *is* rather unfair. Sorry about that. But having 2 different
limited compressed filesystems in kernel does not seem good to me.

Okay, having limit on 4GB compressed is slightly better (and should
mean that SquashFS would actually be usefull to me).

Well, out-of-tree maintainenance takes lot of time, too, so by keeping
limited code out-of-kernel we provide quite good incentive to make
those limits go away.
Perhaps squashfs is good enough improvement over cramfs... But I'd
like those 4Gb limits to go away.
