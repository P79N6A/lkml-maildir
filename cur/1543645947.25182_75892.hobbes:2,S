Yeah, I figured you wouldn't like that part, especially based on your 
discussion with Mark yesterday about the upcoming gendisk changes.
EVMS has traditionally used the gendisk list to get information about what 
disks are available in the system. The walk_gendisk() function in genhd.c was 
suggested last year by Christoph as a method for safely accessing the list, 
and even made it into the 2.4 kernel. Thus we just ported it forward to 2.5 
in our tree. It worked just fine in its original form until 2.5.40. Based on 
your comments in genhd.c about the gendisks array, I assumed further changes 
would be coming. But we had to come up with an interim solution to work on 
2.5.40, and thus we have the version in the submitted patch, which I did not 
intend to be a permanent solution.
So the question is, will there be a method to simply get a list of registered 
disks on the system, or an API to call to run a function for each disk? If 
so, we'll gladly switch to using that. If not, do you have any suggestions 
for how this kind of functionality can be achieved with your upcoming changes?
