PowerPC was designed 64-bit from the start too!  It's just that the  
architecture design group also realized that there would be a demand  
for 32-bit CPUs, and so from the _64-bit_ system, they designed a 32- 
bit system whose entire instruction set would be forward-compatible  
to 64-bit systems when they came out.  That's why 32-bit PowerPC  
machine code and 64-bit PowerPC machine code are completely identical  
except that 64-bit CPUs also have a few opcodes to process 64-bit  
data and a few extra kernel-mode registers.
