Subject: [PATCH][RFC] Semi-pointless NULL test in uli526x driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
In drivers/net/tulip/uli526x.c::uli526x_interrupt() there's a test 
of the function argument 'void *dev_id' against NULL. But that 
test is pretty pointless, since if ever 'dev_id' is NULL we'll 
already have crashed inside "netdev_priv(dev)".
I don't think dev_id can ever actually be NULL, so the whole block 
inside "if (!dev) {" could probably just go away. But I guess 
there's a good reason someone put that ULI526X_DBUG() in there - and
if 'dev_id' /can/ actually be NULL then it's nice to have and in 
that case this patch actually fixes a possible crash (hence the 
version number update). 
So I guess that in this case we should just move the 
"db = netdev_priv(dev)" assignment past that NULL test. That's what 
this patch does.
Found by the Coverity checker.
Compile tested.
PS. Please keep me on Cc when replying.
