We are not living in a world where everyone had good intentions...
For _some_ "wrong-doers" your approach works.
But how do you convince the "wrong-doers" who do things like putting 
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") into their binary-only modules and who ignore you 
and get away because noone sues them?
The spirit of the GPLv2 is to defend the freedom of the software 
(different from the spirit of the BSD licence), and considering that 
there aren't many people defending the GPLv2 copyright of the Linux 
kernel at court against abusers, making it harder for people to do the 
abuse might not be the worst choice...
