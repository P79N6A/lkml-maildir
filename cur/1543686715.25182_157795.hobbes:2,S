i2c-dev.c is annotated in 2.6.  Did I miss anything that needs to be
marked as such?

That's something that will be necessary anyway, if we want to get this
to ever work on a 64 bit processor running with a 32 bit userspace
(amd64, ppc64, sparc64, etc.)

Hm, how about just fixing the tty core to always pass in kernel buffers?
That would fix the "problem" in one place :)
Anyway, that's a 2.7 change that has been on my list of things to do for
a while...

Hm, I had already applied your patch, so this one doesn't apply.  Care
to re-do it against 2.6.0-test4 whenever that comes out?
