I didn't mention any of that here; my reply was simply to correct Helge's 
misunderstanding about why I dislike stuck processes.  Regardless of whether 
the bugs get fixed or the kernel finds a way to work around them, my dislike 
has nothing to do with the overhead or "ugliness" of stuck processes; I 
dislike them because they render my system useless for 75% of the things I 
use it for.
