Hi,
I wonder what a good way is to stress test my JFS filesystem. Is there a tool
that does something like that maybe? Dont't want performance testing, just
all kinds of stress testing to see how the filesystem "is" and to check
integrity and functionality.
What are you filesystem developers use to do something like that?
Thanks,
Axel
