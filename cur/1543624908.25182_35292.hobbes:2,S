Same here (I'd rather say 100%). Temperature reading seems to work in
all machines as well. That's just machines I'm actually touching,
though; so they tend not to be supermarket bargains.
On a halfway related note APM fails to power down my Siemens PCD-5ND
(Pentium 75 laptop) (which obviously doesn't support ACPI).
The interesting thing is that the kernel shipped with RH 7.2 does
power down the machine, just the one from kernel.org doesn't
(2.4.16). (APM compiled as a module).
Is there some patch I could try?
So long,
