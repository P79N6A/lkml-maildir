To back this with numbers:
I'm usually using a non-modular kernel on my computer.
This is the size difference between the same kernel with 
CONFIG_MODULES=y and CONFIG_MODULES=n:
  3799589 vmlinux-with-modules
  3447297 vmlinux-without-modules
Yes, the kernel is becoming bigger by 10% only for supporting modules.
Since the size increase is the space for the module support part of the 
kernel plus some additional space in many object files for stuff like 
EXPORT_SYMBOL's, the relative size increase is most likely even bigger 
for small kernels.
