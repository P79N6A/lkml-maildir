     For what it's worth, SunOS 4.1.4 would also let you do this.  The 'ln'
command wouldn't, but if you were super-user, /usr/etc/link would allow you to
make hard-links to directories, and /usr/etc/unlink would allow you to unlink
them. 
     I played with them somewhat, and never found anything that it broke by
hard linking directories, fsck seemed to handle it fine.  Unlinking a directory
where there were still files and it was the last link would of coarse orphan
those files. 
     I never found any use for this capability that couldn't equally well have
been served with a sym-link, but it was there.
