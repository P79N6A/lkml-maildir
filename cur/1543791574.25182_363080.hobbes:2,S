The problem is how these zones get resized. Can we hotplug memory between 
them, with some sparsemem like indirection layer?
Real customers have shown us that their workloads shift, and they have
different needs at different parts of the day. We can't just pick one
size and call it good. It's the same argument as the traditional VM
balancing act between pagecache, user pages, and kernel pages (which 
incidentally, we don't use zones for). We want the system to be able
to use memory wherever it's most needed.
