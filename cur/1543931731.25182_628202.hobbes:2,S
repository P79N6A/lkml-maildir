No, I don't have module autoloading disabled. modprobe-ing b43
automatically loads ssb. Neither, however, will load rfkill or
rfkill-input. And if they aren't loaded, then b43/ssb are *completely*
silent during load. Nothing to dmesg at all.

WTF? Please read *YOUR OWN MESSAGE* to the bcm43xx-dev list:
https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/bcm43xx-dev/2007-December/006456.html
I'm going to blame this on you being tired or something, okay? But in
the meantime, could you *PLEASE* start giving me the benefit of the
doubt?

There's a patch from Larry Finger to address this and other issues. It
hasn't made it's way fully upstream yet. Please read your message
here, in particular item number seven on Larry's list:

<shrug> Well, then they've made changes to udev or something else to
make this work okay for mere mortals such as myself, and haven't
pushed those changes upstream so that others can benefit from it.

Yes, I know. I'm sorry I was unclear.

As I've said multiple times earlier in this thread, I did try that and
it didn't work. Do you believe me now?

So, do you want a scorecard on this?
One problem related to b43 source code, patch exists, has yet to be
merged upstream.
One problem related to udev rules, that may or may not be fixed in the
latest udev. I have udev version 113, which is the latest shipped in
Ubuntu's nightly development snapshots (hardy heron). I see that
version 117 of udev is available on kernel.org, but mine is from the
end of June. One would think that wouldn't be so old as to be a
complete deal breaker. Especially as bcm43xx works fine with my udev.
The b43 code requires the latest firmware, something that isn't quite
obvious from skimming the changelogs. But is in dmesg, so thanks for
that.
With udev rules hand-edited to include the ATTRS{type}==1 Larry
pointed out (thanks Larry), b43 also seems to create an odd extra
device, wmaster0. Same MAC as eth1, my wireless. It's just an odd
thing that wasn't there before with bcm43xx. May be good, may be bad,
dunno.
And yeah, in my opinion, making the kernel play well with up-to-date
userspace actually *is* part of your job, but then again, what do I
know.
Michael, you're a good guy, I believe that. You're doing unglamorous
and mostly thankless work, and I am thankful for it. I'm afraid the
only way I could make it glamorous is to offer to send you a fancy
feathered outfit to wear while coding :-). But try to meet us testers
halfway, okay? Please keep in mind that I'm really only trying to
help.
Now I'm going to go off, sit in the sun, sip some coffee, and think
happy thoughts of kittens playing with yarn for a while.
