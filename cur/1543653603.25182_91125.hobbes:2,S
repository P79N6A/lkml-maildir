AMD Athlon 800Mhz
Kernel 2.4.19, built with GCC 3.2
VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo Super ACPI]
PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8371 [KX133 AGP] (rev 0).
I've compiled the VIA82cxxx driver into the kernel, not as a module. The
driver works correctly for some time, but after a while it seems that it
can't set certain output frequencies (but it still plays sound), as I
noticed that XMMS plays songs at a slower frequency.
Small output of "dmesg", whole log in attachment:

via_audio: ignoring drain playback error -11
Quake 3 sounds ok, probably becuse it's playing audio at a rate that the
driver still can set (11Khz i think).
