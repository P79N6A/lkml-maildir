Originally, I thought since the PA-RISC stack grows up, we'd want to
place the stack at the bottom of memory and have copy_strings() and
friends work in the opposite direction.  It turns out, though, that
this ends up being way more headache than it's worth, so I just
manually grow the stack down with expand_downwards().
