This may be a little off topic, but is there a way to manually select
this?  I can see having a mode where everything stops thrashing
for a while, in order to let the admin calmly kill off the offending
process, as a useful feature.
It would be useless in an environment where OOM is actually needed
(can't wait for a human admin to show up), but cool for those that
like to bring their machines back from the edge.
