Sure. BTW, (a) that check really belongs to ll_rw_blk() and (b) usage of
buffer cache in fs/partitions/* seems to be _wrong_.

Oh, sure we'll have to call the foo_geninit() from foo_init(), along with
resetup_one_dev(). Then we'll get the same code for module- and built-in
initialization. Actually I've sent such patch to Linus half an hour ago.
Look: what I want to get in the longer run is to reduce dependencies
between block devices and the rest of system as much as possible. It means
	* the less glue we have the better.
	* code duplication between drivers is evil. Changes _never_
propagate and we are ending up with all sorts of breakage on hands.
	* the less we export the better.
	* with the obvious exception of method tables glue structures
should be allocated by the kernel.
	* drivers should not know about partitioning. Things like md
should be able to refer to major:minor, indeed, but that's it - e.g. if we
support partitions _within_ md the driver has no buisiness to know about
their boundaries.
	* drivers should not know about the major:minor splitup, let alone
the tricks with MKDEV(MAJOR(foo), MINOR(foo)&mask|bar).
	* drivers should know as little as possible about struct {file,
dentry, inode, super_block}. Most of them simply don't need to know that.
	* we should have a structure for unit (disk, whatever).
	* we need a way to refer to that structure from block_device and
we need a way to find all opened block_device's belonging to the given
unit.
	* ioctls that refer to partition should be done by VFS (easy).
	* partitioning should belong to VFS (or layer between VFS and
block devices - look at it as you prefer).
	* exclusion between the open and rereading partition table should
be done by VFS. Ditto for module counters upon open/release and for
per-unit reference counters. That way for 90% of devices ->open() and
->release() become NULL.
	* ideally we should have block device methods depending only on
unit. It's defintely so for ->check_media_change() and ->revalidate(), but
it turns out that other stuff it's also so. We have a couple of places
where the thing cares for whole device/some partition (in ioctls), but I
suspect that closer look will show that it just should be unified to
something reasonable - e.g. IDE and SCSI differ in that respect.
	* crap with dropping the old partitions/rereading partition table
(in ->revalidate) should be done in VFS. To start with, devices have funny
differences here (sync_dev vs. fsync_dev, for one) and That Is Not
Good(tm). Besides, this kind of things should be done by _all_
partition-bearing devices and duplicating them to each driver is asking
for trouble.
	* _no_ post-install initialization - we can't have it for modules,
so we must duplicate it in module_init() anyway. Should I mention the fact
that in half of cases we didn't? So setup_dev() logics is _evil_ - driver
should declare all disks (== methods table + name + starting device number
+ amount of device numbers + size) and that should be it. The less
differences between module and built-in cases we have the fewer fsckups
we'll get.
	* (here is the only change to drivers proper) we'ld better do
sector number adjustment/boundary checks in ll_rw_blk.c. Drivers should
not bother with that.
	* I doubt that doing fs/partitions/* stuff via buffer cache is
right. For one thing, it leads to ugly stuff with block sizes. For
another, conceptually it sits below buffer cache - immdeiately above the
IO requests layer.
	* per-major tables are evil. Some of them are actually per-minor
and thus should sit in block_device. Some are per-unit and they should go
into disk_struct.
	* we need an analog of classless routing for device numbers. That
code is completely generic and can be used both by block and character
devices. The structures associated with ranges (and meaning of the ranges)
are going to be very different, though. The only place where we need to go
through such routing tables is loading the drivers (i.e. upon open) - I
have the patch doing that. Normally you keep pointers to the structures
refered from device numbers blocks.
So there... It's a lot of changes in glue, but it fixes quite a few bugs
and reduces the size of said glue big way. Besides it makes the thing much
less prone to breakage upon VFS changes. Changes to the devices proper are
minimal (or none if we don't go for sector number adjustment in
ll_rw_blk).
