That's pretty much what I meant when I said "kernel space hooks",
sorry.  :)
I agree with Egbert, there should not be an x86 emulator in the kernel. 
However, it would be very helpful to kernel space and user space alike
if someone developed a generic way for a device driver to do stuff like
int10 calls.
