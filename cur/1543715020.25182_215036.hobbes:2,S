Hi all.
	I am in doubt about the linux kernel behaviour is this situation:
supose a have the process A, with the highest realtime
priority and SCHED_FIFO policy. The process then issues a syscall,
say read():
	1) Can I be sure that there will be no process switch during the
syscall processing, even if the system call causes a page fault?
	2) What if the process was a non-realtime processes (ordinary
one, SCHED_OTHER)?
Thanks a lot.
Fabiano
