No, I actually think it makes tons of sense. If only because we really
don't have any better guesses (just zeroing it is worse than guessing it
will behave similarly).
One thing that _may_ make sense is to decide that when we "execve()" our
behaviour changes, and as such avg_slice might be different. However, I
again do not see that zeroing it is the right answer. I don't know what
the right answer is, but I bet that leaving it alone is likely to be "more
correct" than most other answers.
