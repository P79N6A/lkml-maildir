That's very important. Yes.

The kernel should boot up in non-trusted mode (with root and SUID root binaries
recieving full capabilities, as it's implemented now).
A simple syscall could then switch the kernel to trusted mode. Afterwards, root
is treated as all other others.
Switching to trusted mode then can easily be done in init scripts, ...
Of course, there shouldn't be a way to switch back to  non-trusted mode...

Andreas
