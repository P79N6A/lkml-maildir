It turns out that while procfs uses a different "mechanism", those
procfs symlinks do point to the real socket dentry, so when you
readlink() on it you do d_path() on the real socket dentry.
If you unhash these things, I'm pretty sure you'll see an ugly
"(deleted)" at the end of the symlink string for /proc/$pid/fd/$X
files that are sockets or something like that.
Al Viro just suggested a way around this to me:
1) Just mark the dentry HASHED by hand in the dentry flags, but don't
   actually hash it.
2) Create a special dentry->d_deleted method for sockets that returns
   0 and clears by hand the HASHED flag bit in the dentry (see what
   dput() does when this happens).
It's an abuse but it will work.
