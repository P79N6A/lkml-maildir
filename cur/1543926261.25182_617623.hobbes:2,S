I guess if you *know* for whatever reason that you hold two references
on the dentry, then that might be safe.
I'd be happier if we could come up with some better way for the setlease
code to determine whether someone has the file open for writing.  The
current tests seem incredibly fragile.
Would it be at all reasonable, for example, to keep a count of the
number of readers stored in the inode?
