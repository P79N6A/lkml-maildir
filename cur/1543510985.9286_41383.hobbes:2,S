If xconfig is known to be broken and nobody wants to fix it then there
is no reason why it cannot be removed from the kernel tree.

Ok so I didn't make it clear in the original posting, however my standpoint
is of course: if there was a bug it should be fixed, but it has still
be very painful to deal with changes due to broken config tools
(ie. xconfig) even recently.

Right I never read that document, it wasn't there when I started
hacking the kernel and I didn't notice it going in. I am not going to
run off chasing new code on some web site, I want to hack the kernel
not modify scripts.
