Again, my point is I'll take klibc out of the udev and hotplug-ng trees
when it is actually on people's systems because it is in the kernel
source tree.  Until that happens I'll continue to keep it in the udev
and hotplug-ng trees, ok?

I don't know, and I really don't care :)

Huh?  You are free to take klibc and do whatever you want to with it
based on the license it has.  No one is restricting you from doing that,
right?

Yes.

Because we still want to actually be able to boot a kernel, right?  :)
Let's just get the early boot stuff building and working properly, and
then we'll worry about ripping the stuff out of the kernel tree then.

Hm, like the other things in the kernel source tree that are also only
in userspace?  :)
thanks,
