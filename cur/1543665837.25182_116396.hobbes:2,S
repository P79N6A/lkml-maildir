You would want a  directory listing command that is a single system 
call, and then that could be made isolated, without risk of userspace 
failing to unlock.   Then you have to worry about very large directories 
straining things in user space, but you can probably have the user 
specify the maximimum size directory his process has space for, etc.
In general, DOS issues are what makes it difficult to introduce 
transactions into the kernel.  We are grappling with that now in 
reiser4.  It seems that the formula is to create atomic plugins, and 
then it is the system administrator's responsibility to verify that he 
can live with whatever DOS vulnerabilities it has before he installs it 
in his kernel (or our responsibility if it is sent to us for inclusion 
in the main kernel).  Allowing arbitrary filesystem operations to be 
combined into one atomic transaction seems problematic for either user 
space or the kernel, depending on what you do.
In general, allowing user space to lock things means that you trust user 
space  to unlock.  This creates all sorts of trust troubles, and if you 
force the unlock after some timeout, then the user space application 
becomes vulnerable to DOS from other processes causing it to exceed the 
timeout.
Ideas on this are welcome.
