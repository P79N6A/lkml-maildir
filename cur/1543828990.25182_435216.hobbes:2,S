The reason I have a special cleanup for the other branches is the easy way to 
tell if the branch wasn't taken is the pswa = orig pswa + instruction length.
The relative branches get cleaned up the same way if the branch was taken or
not, pswa = probe_addr + (out of line end psw - out of line start psw). These
are all relative branches and while they need cleanup, they don't get treated
differently based on the branch status.

Yep, I misunderstood that. The serialization is the point, not the replacement
of a word in memory.
