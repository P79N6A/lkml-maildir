Is it correct that drivers which call {interruptible_,}sleep_on can miss
wakeup events unless they either own the big kernel lock or the
global-cli lock before calling sleep_on()?
Normally, I would use the sequence
* add_wait_queue
* set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE)
* check that you must wait, and that someone will wake you up.
* schedule().
If you use sleep_on(), then the sequence is
* check that you must wait, and that someone will wake you up.
* within sleep_on:
  add_wait_queue
  set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE)
  schedule().
If this is really a problem, then (AFAICS) the DAC960 driver could lock
up.
