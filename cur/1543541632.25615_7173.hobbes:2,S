   While I'm not neccissarily an "NTFS person," I feel 
   compelled to point out that NTFS named streams operate 
   as normal files, and are accessed via a namespace 
   extension, the ":" character. BeFS, HPFS, etc. Extended 
   Attributes can be built on top of NTFS-style Named 
   Streams by providing accessor functions that simply 
   opening a stream, writing a chunk of data to it, and 
   closing it again. NTFS is the only FS, AFAIK, that 
   supports such a generic view of streams. BeFS, the Mac,
   etc. all use Extended Attributes available as name-value 
   pairs only via special functions.
Trying to map Extended Attributes on top of the Named Streams
abstraction is at best problematic.
For example, suppose you have an EA:
	Creator=tytso
Now suppose you do the following:
	fd = open("~/Myfile/Creator")
	write(fd, "acox", 4);
	close(fd)
What does the EA contain now?  Is it:
	Creator=acoxo
or is it 
	Creator=acox
Under Named Streams, it should be "acoxo", but trying to implement that
on a filesystem that uses Extended Attributes is very strange.  
If you go in the other direction, and you write:
	fd = open("~/Myfile/Creator")
	write(fd, "The ", 4);
	write(fd, "Eric ", 5);
	write(fd, "Youngdale ", 10);
	write(fd, "Committee" , 9);
	close(fd);
This is going to be awkward at best for a filesystem with Extended
Attributes, as it will need to do an EA replace operation for each
write, while it simluates the concept of a file pointer ---- which
doesn't exist in the standard EA programming interface:
     int attr_{get,set}(const char *path, const char *attrname,
		   char	*attrvalue, int	*valuelength, int flags);
So as much as I understand the desire for one API "to rule them them all
and in the darkness bind them", I really believe that Extended
Attributes are fundamentally different from Named Streams, and you
really shouldn't try to stretch EA's over the Named Streams procrustean
bed.
