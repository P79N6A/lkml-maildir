On s390 we currently don't do anything suspend related at all - I'd
need to think about that. (I use device_move() to reflect topology
changes on the (virtual) hardware, so I'd guess the "don't suspend
parent before child rule" should still apply afterwards. But of course,
that also depends on what we actually need to do on the parent's bus and
what on the child's bus.)
