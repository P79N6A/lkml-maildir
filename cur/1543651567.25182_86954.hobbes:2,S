Yes, we are putting that in as one of the alternative dump targets
available. I have done quite a bit of work on that implementing the
ideas we talked about at OLS, and that's what I've been referring
to as the memory dump target.  Its not quite ready yet and we
need something like kexec to be available which we can use on Intel 
systems to achieve the softboot (the acceptance status of that still
doesn't seem to be clear), so I was looking at this as a
follow-on thing once the core infrastructure is there. More so 
because we probably need to give it some time to stabilize and try 
it on different environments and look at the issues you mention.
Why do we even consider the other options when we are doing 
this already ? Well, as we discussed earlier there's non-disruptive dumps 
for one, where this wouldn't work. The other is that before overwriting 
memory we need to be able to stop all activity in the system for certain
(system may appear hung/locked up) and I'm not fully certain about
how to do this for all environments. Maybe an answer lies in 
rethinking some parts of the algorithm a bit.
Also having the interface allows people to develop more specific/
reliable solutions for their environment. So we do not necessiate 
code duplication, but if something exists, then the infrastructure 
can use it. 
The general feeling here is that a one solution fits all thing 
may not work best right now ... and hence the focus on an interface 
based approach that gives us the needed flexibility.

Hope that helps a bit.
