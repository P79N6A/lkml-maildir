i brought up this issue on the KJ list once upon a time:
https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/kernel-janitors/2007-February/017847.html
and there didn't seem to be much enthusiasm for it.
  however, i am still curious why there isn't more use of the
already-defined "clear_page" macro.  most architectures appear to
define it:
$ grep -r "define.*clear_page" include
but there are still numerous explicit calls to memset() to zero a
chunk of memory that is exactly PAGE_SIZE in size.  just an
observation.
