You misunderstood my objection:
we cannot assume that every page is mapped in the kernel linear mapping:
- with DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, lots of pages are removed from the linear mapping
- even without it, all pages that are used for AGP are removed from the 
mapping.
Thus if something fails with DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, it will fail sometimes 
with AGP gart as well.

DEBUG_PAGEALLOC unmaps pages on kmem_cache_free and __free_pages(). The 
pages are mapped again during get_free_pages and kmem_cache_alloc.
0x86000 looks like a normal page - what guarantees that it's not used by 
the kernel?
