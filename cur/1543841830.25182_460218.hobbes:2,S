Well yes, because it is not "mine". ;)
It is, after all, just a typedef of the C99 _Bool-type.

A generic boolean to an integer? And if Andrew toss that patch, this one 
will follow.
So what is wrong with this path?

If _that_ is the problem, I am happy to help. Did not want to touch more 
then the already defined "booleans", because it seemed to scare some people.
After all, what interest me next most to a generic boolean, is using 
booleans when it obviously is a boolean.

Is that set in stone? Or is there a chance to (in my opinion) improve 
the readability, by setting the variables to their real type.
