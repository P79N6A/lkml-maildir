Well, it has, in the past week, ran memtest86-3a for 12 full passes 
over the whole gig of ram with no errors.  This was the longest test, 
I gave it a 2 hour, 5 pass test before I ever booted linux the first 
time on this motherboard over 2 weeks ago now, a new Biostar 
M7NCD-Pro, with an nforce2(3?) chipset.  I did that because I was 
comeing from an older board whose memory had been overstressed by a 
failing video card and I wanted to make sure this new memory, nearly 
$210 worth of it, was good. I gave it another, probably 4 hour test 
after the first couple of crashes, which it also passed.  And it got 
worse as the kernel versions incremented from 2.6.7.  I can have the 
same fault in prune_dcache() while running a 2.6.7 kernel without an 
instant lockup, but it will eventually die, maybe half an hour later.  
Move to 2.6.7-mm1, which has a patch to fs/dcache.c that remains 
untouched thru 2.6.8-rc2, and those kernels, if they lock up, do it 
totally, often with nothing in the logs at all.  That was the case 
today, on 2.6.8-rc3, which has a new dcache.c patch in it if I read 
the release notes correctly.
If this is dodgy hardware, give me something to take to tcwo.com when 
I ask for an rma.  Not having M$ windows of any kind here, I frankly 
haven't had the inclination to look at the cd's that came with the 
board.  Should I?
Or does linux have a hardware test suite I've not heard about?
