at the same time I'm not 100% convinced it's ok to always run all quirks
at resume, for one the difference is that there now is a driver active
owning the device... Almost sounds like having a per quirk flag stating
"run at resume" is needed ;-(
(also I think the quirks are currently __init but that's relatively easy
to fix)
