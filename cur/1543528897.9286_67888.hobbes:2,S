Hi Stephen,
We at NUS have implemented network packet scheduler support for 2.0.34
kernels (a port of FreeBSD's ALTQ, with CBQ and EDD packet scheduler and
RSVP support) as part of our activities here at the NUS Mobile IP project.
Codes can be obtained from 
http://mip.ee.nus.edu.sg/v3.0beta
 
while a prerelease can be obtained from 
http://mip.ee.nus.edu.sg/v3.1beta
More information about the NUS Mobile IP project can be obtained from
the NUS Mobile IP project web site located at 
http://mip.ee.nus.edu.sg
Volunteers are greatly encouraged to participate in this open-sourced
project, we've plenty of networking (QoS, Mobile IP, MANET, etc) projects
requiring people to work on.
P/S AFAIK 2.0 and 2.2 are significantly different beasts, IP networking
wise. 
Best regards,
Foo Chun Choong
