Would the next step be to find the various per-CPU data in the kernel
and convert it to your new form?  I.e., is this a general purpose
interface for per-CPU data structures, or am I missing something?
If it is, this is a good idea.  Other Unices have this (IRIX comes to
mind).  One of the biggest advantages, IMO, is simply the readability --
data structures that are per-CPU have varying methods of creation and
referencing.  The implicit locking (i.e., none) can be unclear.
Bring everything together can be a good thing.
