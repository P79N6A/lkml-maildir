Right.  And the abstract namespace does nothing with the current
filesystem.

The socket entry in the filesystem but really the socket
inode number in that entry.  This entry has nothing to with dentry's
or mount refs so if I read the correctly every path to that socket
should yield the same entry.

Yep.

Nope.  Except for the fact that names are peculiar (sockets, network
device names, IP address, routes...) the network stack splits quite cleanly.
I did all of this in a proof of concept mode several months ago and
the code is still sitting in my git tree on kernel.org.  I even got
the generic stack reference counting fixed.
