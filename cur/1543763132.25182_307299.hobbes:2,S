Here's some belated comments.  I won't even pretend to understand
any of your (imo overcomplex) driver - which is the reason I haven't
bothered commenting before now.
However, it seems that there may be some duplication between what
you're doing and what the rest of the kernel is doing for you.
This may not be desirable, and may actually cause subtle problems,
especially if you and the rest of the kernel decides to send, eg,
an XOFF character (so the remote end sees two XOFF characters).

This is not necessary.  Since you're using the serial core, if you
look at what it's already doing for you, you'll see that uart_shutdown()
already takes care of this.

Wouldn't you think the kernel already takers are of flow control, given
that it already handles the sending of the X* characters?
