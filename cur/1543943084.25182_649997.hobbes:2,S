See? It even has completely useless help text.
Does WMI stand for Windows Management Instrumentation? It is some
server management feature? What is it good for?

  WMI (EXPERIMENTAL) (ACPI_WMI) [N/m/y/?] (NEW) ?
This driver adds support for the ACPI-WMI mapper device (PNP0C14)
found on some systems.
NOTE: You will need another driver or userspace application on top of
this to actually use anything defined in the ACPI-WMI mapper.
