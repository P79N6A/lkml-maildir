I don't really see the relevence of what you're saying.
Maybe I wasn't clear when I said 'audited for security issues' - I meant
ensuring that fixes for 2.4 also eventually went in to 2.6.  I'm not talking
about doing any kind of complete audit of the entire codebase.
For a long time, (since before 2.6.0), there were known local root exploits
that had been fixed in 2.4 and not in 2.6.  I never saw those fixed, but I
don't have the details of them to hand, nor do I have the time to search
through years of mailing list archives at the moment.  However, I am also not
claiming that 2.6 is stable, (yet).
John.
