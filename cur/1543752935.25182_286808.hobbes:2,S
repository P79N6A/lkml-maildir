Yes. On various models, I can turn off some ASIC cells, some of them
being PCI devices. I do that dynamically for power management typically.
Depending on the chipset, tapping one of those "disabled" cells with
config space accesses results in either all 1's or a lockup. On the
former, I currently do nothing special (but that cause problems with
various distro HW detection/configuration tools or the possible problem
with X you mentioned, among others), on the later, I have a special
filter in my pmac low level config space access routines to block access
to those sleeping devices (and currently to return all 1's).
I'm pretty sure similar situations can happen on other archs when
pushing a bit on power management, especially things like handhelds
(though not much of them are PCI based for now).
That's why a "generic" mecanism to hide such devices while providing
cached data on config space read's would be useful to me as well.
Ben.
