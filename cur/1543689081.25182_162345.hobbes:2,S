I do not think any of these implications are true, except (4).
A stable driver API would certainly imply (4).  But I see no relation to
(a) -- actually, an API would bring complications and thus bloat, if
anything.  I see no relation to (2).  And (3) just seems like a wild
guess.
I agree that (4) would be a good thing.  The problem is, its really not
what we have here today and not what any of the kernel developers want. 
95% of the drivers (and 100% of those that the kernel developers use)
_are_ source-based and in the tree, so why have a stable API for them?
In other words, yes, (4) is nice.  But not that nice, as a stable API
and driver interface implies a lot of other things that are not
necessarily good.
On the bright side, I do think that we will see a much more stable API
in 2.6.  2.4.n for n after Marcelo took over has also been stable.
