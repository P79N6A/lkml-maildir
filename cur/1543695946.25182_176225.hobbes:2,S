Most of that story is just submitting and completing URBs.
I'd either try changing the spots in drivers/usb/core/hcd.c
marked as appropriate for generic MONITOR_URB hooks (printk
if it's your HID device, maybe), or manually turn on whatever
HCD-specific hooks exist (maybe use a VERBOSE message level).
Such a thing wasn't possible in 2.4 since there were too
many different bizarre (and sometimes buggy) ways for URBs
to return to the usb device drivers and get implicitly
resubmitted.
