nice work Peter, i find this "system sets" extension to cpusets a much 
more elegant (and much more future-proof) solution than the proposed 
spreadout of the limited hack of isolcpus/cpu_isolated_map. It 
concentrates us on a single API and on a single mechanism to handle 
isolation matters. (be that for clustering/supercomputing or real-time 
purposes)
Thanks for insisting on using cpusets for this!
i've queued up your patches in sched-devel.git, and lets make sure this 
has no side-effects on existing functionality. (it shouldnt)
