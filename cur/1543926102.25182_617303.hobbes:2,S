Hi,
I tried the series of patches and I encountered some problems.
Since I don't have enough time to investigate them, I can only
report them at present. My environment was ia64 machine with 64
hotplug slots (shpc & pcie). Those slots can be handled by
acpiphp too, though I have not tried it yet.
- Problem(1)
  Two kind of Call Traces were displayed so many times at the
  boot time. Those are attached below. I guess it relate to
  the ACPI Namespace definition.
- Problem(2)
  Many of the shpc slot initializations failed with the
  following error messages. I guess the cause is Problem(1).
  shpchp: pci_hp_register failed with error -17
  shpchp: shpchp: slot initialization failed
- Problem(3)
  All of the pcie slot initializations failed with the
  following error messages. I guess the cause is Problem(1).
  pciehp: pci_hp_register failed with error -17
  pciehp: pciehp: slot initialization failed
BTW, I have some comments about the patches.
- I think your patches assume that all the hotplug slots have
  ACPI _SUN method regardless of the hotplug controller type,
  because pci_slot.c is the only place to call pci_slot_create().
  But I think there are hotplug slots without _SUN. If the
  hotplug slot doesn't have _SUN, slot initialization by the
  hotplug controller driver doesn't work (does it?), because
  there are no slot directory.
- I think pci_slot.o should be kernel module so that users can
  select to enable or disable this functionality.
Here is the Call Trace mentioned above:
