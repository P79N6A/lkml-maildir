Subject: [OSDL][BENCHMARK] OSDL-DBT-2 - 2.4 vs 2.5 4-way/8-way with vmstat

As Andrew requested, we now have posted DBT-2 results with vmstat
  data included for the 8-way workloads we reported previously.
  Runs have been included from both the cached and non-cached variants
  of the workload. The 8-way results used the same database cache
  size setting (2656M).
  In addition, we have results for DBT-2 running on STP for the cached workload
  comparing 2.4.18 versus 2.5.54dcl (the Data Center Linux kernel). In these
  runs we varied the database cache size setting (LM=2031MB, MM=2344MB,
  HH=2656M).
  Summary of results (Higher Metric is better)
  CPUs OS  Load Memory Metric (Avg)
  ---- --- ---- ------ ------------

  4way 2.5 Cached MM----2939.8
  % speedup 2.5vs2.4----- 5.51 <---
  4way 2.4 Cached HM----2786
  4way 2.5 Cached HM----2947.2
  % speedup 2.5vs2.4----- 5.79 <---
  Here are some highlights/comments:
  Both the 4 way runs and the 8-way runs show improvement going from
  2.4 to 2.5.  The improvement is larger for the 8-way run. We believe
  the 2.5 4-way would have improved more if it had not hit a CPU wall.
  Observe the plot of vmstat percent user data  at :
  
http://www.osdl.org/projects/dbt2dev/results/STP_4way/us.html
  From the data and the plots, you will notice a big change about
  every 10 minutes.  That is the time the database does a "savepoint".
  It writes dirty pages to the database files.  This happened in the
  cached runs and the non-cached runs.
  We welcome your comments on why we are seeing this improvement.
  As, always we also welcome suggestions for improvement, and random complaints.
