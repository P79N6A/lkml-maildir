Oh, I remember one performance caveat of this code on preempt kernels:
at very high loads, (ie. lots of tasks being woken in the up path),
the wakeup code would end up doing a lot of context switches to and
from the tasks it is waking up.
This could be easily solved by disabling preempt (and would be still
better in terms of interrupt latency and lock hold times), however I
never got around to implementing that.
