Now that I've had some time to actually apply your patches to
2.6.16-rc1 and look them over more carefully, I see my mistake.  I
overlooked the assignment of 
	conf = mddev->private 
In the lines just below there, and I see how you do clean it up.  I
guess I would have just done it the other way around:
	conf = kzalloc()
	if (!conf) 
		goto abort:
	.
	.	
	.
	mddev->private = conf;
Though now that I look at it, don't we have a circular reference
here?  Let me quote the code section, which starts of with where I was
confused: 
        mddev->private = kzalloc(sizeof (raid5_conf_t), GFP_KERNEL);
        if ((conf = mddev->private) == NULL)
                goto abort;
        conf->disks = kzalloc(mddev->raid_disks * sizeof(struct disk_info),
                              GFP_KERNEL);
        if (!conf->disks)
                goto abort;
        conf->mddev = mddev;
        if ((conf->stripe_hashtbl = kzalloc(PAGE_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL)) == NULL)
                goto abort;
Now we seem to end up with:
	mddev->private = conf;
	conf->mddev = mddev;
which looks a little strange to me, and possibly something that could
lead to endless loops.  But I need to find the time to sit down and
try to understand the code, so don't waste much time educating me
here.
Thanks for all your work on this Neil, I for one really appreciate it!
John
