To Whom It May Concern:
I rebuilt my kernel (2.4.22) yesterday, and when I rebooted, I
got the following screen:
Uncompressing linux...
...ran out of input data.
-- System halted.
At that point, even the keyboard was frozen; I had to power down
my computer by pressing the switch instead of rebooting with
CTRL+ALT+DEL.  I had been running a 2.4.22 kernel when I built
the new kernel; however, I enabled the following options between
builds:
Modules: check version information
BSD process accounting
Check for stack overflows
Compile kernel with frame pointers
I am posting my config file at:
