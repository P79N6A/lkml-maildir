Great, now a standard mass-market computer is an embedded device. I can
(and will) certainly do it, but this looks like a ticking bomb to me.
More than half the original problems where the option was labelled
CONFIG_SERIO_I8042 instead of something user-understandable like PS/2
input, and it's just been replaced by another mess that will make no
sense to the average user. There's even no notice in the input menu to
where this was moved :(
Anyway, thanks for the tip. I hope for you I'm the first and last to ask
you about this.
