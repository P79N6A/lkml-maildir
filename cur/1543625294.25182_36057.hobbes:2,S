Does it also lock up when the text console blanks?
The X lockups were what had been plaguing me for the past two weeks.  
I thought it was the new Radeon (7500), but it seems[1] to have been my 
Asus CUSL2-C's[2] broken APM implementation (Quite recently Alan Cox 
mentioned this problem with Asus' BIOS).
Out of fear, I do not compile in ACPI[3].
I have since recompiled with APM as a module and life seems much more
stable.  (I issue "modprobe apm" at shutdown so the box actually turns 
off :)
Perhaps your BIOS has similar "issues"?

[1] No lockup in 3 days.  Knock bits.
[2] Intel 815ep, 700MHz Coppermine PIII not overclocked.
    RH6.2 frankensteined to 7.2 (mostly)
    kernel 2.4.15 (with Viro's inode patch) (yes, yes, I'm slow)
    (RH's gcc-2.96-98)
    XFree86 4.2.0 from their binary tarballs.
[3] One of the side-effects of ACPI support is disabling APM if
    an ACPI capable board is found.  This, I suspect, is why reports
    of CUSL2 hangs are rare...
