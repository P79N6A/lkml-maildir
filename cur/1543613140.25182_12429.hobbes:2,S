Thought about slightly different idea but didn't test it (I'm now about 300 km
away from a box where I did the tests and it will be so up to Cristmas):
	move both port operations used before and after call to
	__start_dac() and __start_adc() inside these inline procedures.
	In this case we would have waiting for results of __start_dac
	only when it really needed, so no possibility of deadlock
	there

If we moved 
                outb((inb(port+OFF_CIV)+1)&31, port+OFF_LVI);
and 
                while( !(inb(port + OFF_CR) & ((1<<4) | (1<<2))) ) ;
from inside __i810_update_lvi to __start_adc and __start_dac (inside
if block) we would avoid deadlocks. If You like to have noticed that
__start_dac ot __start_adc is called when they should not, then
add printk with message there (or even disable sound support totally with 
additional error message in log, so user will complain). I think leaving out 
possiblility of deadlocks is too dangerous.

I would suggest to disable sound support and give reasonable error message
in this case. So user will able to complain if this happens. It's more 
difficult to get usefull report when deadlock happens (and many users may not 
want to debug and provide additional info it in this case any more)
