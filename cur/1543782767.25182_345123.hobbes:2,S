Sadly, this patches doesn't improve the situation for my Mobility M7 
mounted on a Dell C640.
(and no, I didn't apply the 4:th patch regarding locking it to only the 
M9 version).
Everything but the display resumes properly.
All I get is a small white box which I can move about using the mouse.
Switching between virtual terminals doesn't improve the situation either.
I'll gladly help you out if you want me to do some testing.
With best regards
