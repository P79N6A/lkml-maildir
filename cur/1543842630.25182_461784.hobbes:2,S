In fact, on most systems you absolutely do have ordering between
MMIO and memory accesses.
So you are making an extremely poor engineering decision
by trying to fixup all the drivers to match PowerPC's
semantics.  I think a smart engineer would decrease his
debugging burdon, by matching his platform's MMIO accessors
such that it matches what other platforms do and therefore
inheriting the testing coverage provided by all platforms.
Otherwise you will be hunting down these kinds of memory
barrier issues forever.
