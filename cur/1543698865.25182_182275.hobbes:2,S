well, judging from the Super Micro documentation
(which looks sufficient to me I would say it shouldn't 
be too hard to code a watchdog driver similar to the 
one in linux-2.4.23/drivers/char/wdt.c
the testing will be a little more complicated, as
as you'll have to do it with the 'reboot' activated
which will force your system down, if it works
(in development the actual reset is often replaced
by a signal light showing that the reset 'would'
occur)
best,
