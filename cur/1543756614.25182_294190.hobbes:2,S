They are all the same except they have a different owner.  What I was
trying to do was have them initialized in the tpm specific drivers so
that the attribute ownership would be correct but then create them in
the generic driver since that was common to all the specific drivers.  I
could have one copy of the attributes like the one in the mm tree now
and change the owner when ever I want to add or remove the attribute. 
Would that be correct?
