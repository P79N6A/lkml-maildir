We've thus-far avoided doing this.  In fact a similar construct in
device-mapper was recently removed.
Unlike many other attempts, this one appears to be correct (people usually
get powerpc wrong, due to its u64=unsigned long).
That being said, I'm not really sure we want to add this.  It produces
rather nasty-looking source code and thus far we've just used %llu and we've
typecasted the sector_t to `unsigned long long'.  That happens in a lot of
places in the kernel and perhaps we don't want to start innovating in ext4
;)
That also being said...  does a 32-bit sector_t make any sense on a
48-bit-blocknumber filesystem?  I'd have thought that we'd just make ext4
depend on 64-bit sector_t and be done with it.
Consequently, sector_t should largely vanish from ext4 and JBD2, except for
those places where it interfaces with the VFS and the block layer. 
Internally it should just use 64-bit quantities.  That could be u64, but
I'd suggest that the fs simply open-code `unsigned long long' so that we
don't need to play any gams at all when passing these things into printk.
Finally, perhaps the code is printing block numbers too much ;)
<Notices E3FSBLK, wonders how that snuck through>
I'd suggest that "[patch] ext3: remove E3FSBLK" be written and merged
before we clone ext4, too...
