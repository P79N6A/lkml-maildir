The two backup systems we use make use of "tar" and "ufsdump".
I understand that some systems use proprietary backup agents.
However, this is Linux we're talking about. If you want to 
mount NTFS as your native partition, then you probably don't 
need backups, because you're crazy. And the "default" filesystem 
-- ext2 -- doesn't support EAs or streams.
For systems running streams-capabile filesystems, there will be
versions or tar, pax, and fsdump that will work, I'm sure. The
tar and pax people are already talking about doing it *anyway*,
I think.

Mmm. Yes, but is file=(file+directory) the right way to present it?
It means than the file will respond properly to tests to see if
it's a directory. So tools will end up thinking that it *is* a 
directory.
