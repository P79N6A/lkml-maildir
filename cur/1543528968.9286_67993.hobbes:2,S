Before you use it, you might want to change this:
--->  if [ "$CONFIG_PCI" = "y" ]; then
         if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
            tristate '    DM9102 PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter support (EXPERIMENTAL)' CONFIG_DM9102
         fi
      fi
I missed the closing " on "$CONFIG_PCI" in the
patch.  I couldn't figure out why it wouldn't
work -- I should have turned on syntax highlighting.

That would be really nice and would fix things like the problem I had on 
2.3.48 with CONFIG_PCI breaking parport code (?!)  I have yet to try 
anything later.
