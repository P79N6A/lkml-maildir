ok, some aditional information:
Driver were loaded as module.
Shortest cable I used is roughly 60cm long, has 3 connectors and shipped
with an 2940U. Terminators were all active (didn't use the passive onboard
terminator of the NCR). Easiest Setup was:
active internal terminator
  |
  | 20cm
  |
  +NCR
  |
  | 40cm
  |
  +DDRS with termination turned on.
Did I get the simplest possible setup? Maybe I should have used an active
external HD-DSub terminator, but I had none. I tried a HD-Dsub to Centronics
Adapter with an external active Centronics Termonator, too.
This is only one out of a zillion SCSI setups I tested.
I used a Gigabyte 586HX2 board (Intel 430HX chipset) with a 200MMX Pentium
and a Gigabyte 6LX1 board (440LX chipset) and a 266MHz P2. Nothing was
ever overclocked, PCI bus runs at regular 33 Mhz.
The 200MMX has 96MB RAM with (real) Parity, ECC is enabled. The P2 has 64MB
PC66 SDRAMS.

I'm currently using the NCR with a 1,50 meter cable and

and have no problems. The IBM DORS is a Wide devices with an adapter. The HP
disk is the above mentioned Seagate (relabeled) with SCA-80 connector and
appropriate adapter. I suppose none of this devices does ultra SCSI.

To be more precisely, I think it isn't only hardware's fault. Maybe the
ultra DDRS behaves kind of strange, but the BSD-driver seems to be able to
cpmpensate it. It would be nice if the linux driver did  this, too.

jepp - until I tested this with FreeBSD on the *same* system I definatly
thought I had hardware that is (too) defective. Maybe FreeBSD *does* special
workarounds, but why can't we, too?

This inspired me to search linux-kernel archives, too. Damn why didn't I do
this earlier? There are much more useful replies than I found in linux-scsi
archives. See below for some quotes.

The intention was to to supply Shaw with additional Information I had. As
mentioned above I have kind of solved the Problem (although I'm still
interested in really resolving it).
What information do you need exactly? Kernel? Controller? Disk? cabling?
Termination? Most of them were in my mail. I posted more info in a follow up
and in a mail to linux-scsi. I put everything else I could imagine might be
impurtant into this mail. Ofcourse I dont expect you to dig through any
list/archive to find them.

exactly. But if you don't know A you need to find it somehow. And doing
sensless things is still better than doing nothing.

In two different boards which dont show any problems otherwise? One of those
boxen usually runs 24/7 and is quiet busy. Yes, I know, it's still
possible, but isn't it rather improbable.

possible. But why isn't the aic7xx driver vulnerable? I doubt, I'm capable
finding the guilty part in this case.

FAT is known to be broken ;-) (citing Alexander Viro), but I get phase
change errors with ext2, too.

Shaw has a DDRS, too. This makes 3 DDRS and one DCRS. This needn't say
anything, but maybe the Ultra (?) IBM drives attrakt the trouble?
Thanks
