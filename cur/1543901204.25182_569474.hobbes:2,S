Well, this illustrates the problem.  With ACPI, the devices are suspended
and without it their kind of quiesced.
Generally, we need to make them be quiesced with or without ACPI.  IOW,
the per-driver callbacks used before hibernation should be different from those
used before the suspend (to RAM and similar).

No, we don't.
Still, my question was related to how kexec _normally_ handles devices.  Are
they shut down or they are just left in the state in which they were before?
I assume that kexec loads a new kernel into memory and then passes control
to it, but I think the new kernel needs to set up devices for itself.  I assume
that this is done in a usual way, ie. devices are detected, registered,
initialized, etc.  So, my question is if kexec prepares devices for that in any
way.

We don't use PG_nosave flags any more at all.

This is not the point.  There are memory regions that you should not _restore_,
because that will cause harm.

No, it's not.
