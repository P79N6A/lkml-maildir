Hello all.
I also can say this, maybe its help:
At old kernels my servers do 100% soft interupt if traffic more 600mbs.
Without your patches at new kernel i get crash only at heavy network
load PCs (more then 400mbs-500mbs). Servers that get 100-200 mbs not
crashed long time.
I remember that i not test patch #4, because you sat what its only
another way to temporary fix and mainline problem in hrtimer , but i try
turn on HiRes and Dynamic Tics in kernel - its not help for me.
Best Regals. Slavon
