Hi,
Well, I tried backing out the vm changes from pre4, no
luck so started disabling things.  So far, it seems my
firewall script is at fault.  I looked through the
pre3-pre4 diff and the only change to the nat code is a
one-liner.

# [NETFILTER]: NAT range calculation fix.
# 
# This patch fixes a logic bug in NAT range calculations, which also
# causes a large slowdown when ICMP floods go through NAT.

Reversing that change has thus far fixed things over here
but time will tell.  Is there any possible way that that
particular change is somehow not smp safe?
