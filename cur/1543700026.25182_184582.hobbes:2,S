For the record: PCI Express is _not_ PCI-X.

software point of view, it's (more or less) backwards-compatible with PCI,
while PCI-X is completely backwards compatible with PCI.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
