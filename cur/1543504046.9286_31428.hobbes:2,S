Is that 20-40 usecs response to an interrupt on the port?  I'm finding
that the interrupt latency is around about that, at least by the time you
respond to the interrupt.  Perhaps I'm doing something wrong though.
I have a 'virtual printer' up and running, but of course it's much slower
than a real printer.  If I do 'tunelp /dev/lp0 -w 40' on the 'host',
I don't miss any interrupts.  -w 30 and I start losing them.
Tim.
