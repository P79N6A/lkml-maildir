Hi Linus,
I'd like you to pull the task_killable branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/willy/misc.git
All the patches have been posted to linux-kernel before, and various
comments (and acks) have been taken into account.
Andrew's had the first fifteen patches (up to, and including 'Use
lock_page_killable') in his tree for a few months.  There's a lot more
work pending, but it's all incremental improvements.
