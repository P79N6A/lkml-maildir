It looks like this has been addressed in the thread "242-ac3 loop
bug".  Jens Axboe posted a patch, but the list archive I'm reading
mangled it.  Jens, could you make this patch available somewhere, or
at least email me a copy?  (If it's going in an upcoming -ac patch,
then don't bother; I can wait until then.)
Thanks.
