This patch fixes an inefficiency and potential system lockup in the 2.4
kernel's ext3 filesystem.  The problem has been present since 2.4.20-pre5. 
This patch is applicable to 2.4.20.  A copy is at
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.4/2.4.20/ext3-scheduling-storm.patch
Anyone who is using tasks which have realtime scheduling policy on ext3
systems should apply this change.
Details:
At the start of do_get_write_access() we have this logic:
	repeat:
		lock_buffer(jh->bh);
		...
		unlock_buffer(jh->bh);
		...
		if (jh->j_list == BJ_Shadow) {
			sleep_on_buffer(jh->bh);
			goto repeat;
		}
The problem is that the unlock_buffer() will wake up anyone who is sleeping
in the sleep_on_buffer().
So if task A is asleep in sleep_on_buffer() and task B now runs
do_get_write_access(), task B will wake task A by accident.  Task B will then
sleep on the buffer and task A will loop, will run unlock_buffer() and then
wake task B.
Net effect: the system does 100,000 context switches/sec until I/O completes
against the buffer and kjournald changes the value of jh->j_list.
Unless task A and task B happen to both have realtime scheduling policy - if
they do then kjournald will never run.  The state is never cleared and your
box locks up.
The fix is to not do the `goto repeat;' until the buffer has been taken off
the shadow list.  So we don't go and wake up the other waiter(s) until they
can actually proceed to use the buffer.
