It looks like the migor_config has NUMA=y so is there not a cpu_to_node function?
(looking with cscope didn't find it.)
I believe this may be the source of the error:
include/linux/gfp.h:
static inline struct page *alloc_pages_node(int nid, gfp_t gfp_mask,
                                                unsigned int order)
{
...
        /* Unknown node is current node */
        if (nid < 0)
                nid = numa_node_id();
include/linux/mmzone.h:
#include <linux/topology.h>
/* Returns the number of the current Node. */
#ifndef numa_node_id
#define numa_node_id()          (cpu_to_node(raw_smp_processor_id()))
#endif
I can't put into include/linux/topology.h the catchall default:
#ifndef cpu_to_node
#define cpu_to_node(cpu)	(0)
#endif
Because some arch's have it defined as an inline function.  Perhaps the
easiest would be to add to include/asm-sh/topology.h a simple define of
cpu_to_node()?
Thanks,
Mike
