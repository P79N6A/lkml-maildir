Ugh, I was afraid of that :(

Well, for that, I'll have to set the bus ops when they are discovered.
So the same callback I mentioned can be used for that (due to the need
to check the ranges in the MCFG table).  I'll work on that too.
Does the K8 box just not have MCFG entries for the northbridge busses?

Ah, I thought it was to also actually support the MCFG table for boxes
that supported the different mmconfig addresses.

Ok, I'll work on this and the above mentioned stuff too.
