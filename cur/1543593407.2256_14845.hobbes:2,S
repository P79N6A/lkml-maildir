I see.  Your explanation makes sense, and close won't affect the mmap
(unless you explicitly trigger it in the driver, which you should).
Other drivers deal with this; you may want to go grepping for do_munmap
and see how they handle it.

Look at drivers/char/drm, for example.  At mmap time they allocate a
vm_ops to the address space.  With that you catch changes to the vma
structure initiated by a user mmap, munmap, etc.  You could also
dynamically map the pages in using the nopage method (optional).
The less elegant way of doing this is to put in your userspace API some
conditions which say:  if you do the following:
    open(fd);
    ioctl(fd, give_me_the_buf);
    munmap(some_or_all_of_the_buf);
    buf2 = mmap(...);
    close(fd);  /* or ioctl(fd, shrink_the_buf); */
    buf2[27] = 3;
you will be killed with a sigbus.  I.e. don't manually munmap the
region.
