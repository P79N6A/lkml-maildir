Subject: Bugs in NFS client in Linux 2.2.3 - I need your help to debug it.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I continue seeing problems with Linux 2.2.3 NFS client. I am editing text
files under XEmacs. After long time working, I see that the files on the
server are corrupted with NULLs at the start, or truncated to size 0.
If I look at the files from the Linux client, they look OK. This message
is logged:
nfs_refresh_inode: mismatch, ino=3726, fattr=4085
nfs_refresh_inode: mismatch, ino=3726, fattr=3610
nfs_refresh_inode: mismatch, ino=3726, fattr=3610
This problem happened with kernels 2.2.0preX, 2.2.0 and 2.2.1. It was reported 
to this mailing list.
This machine is a Linux 2.2.3, compiled for SMP with 2 Pentium II 350MHz
CPUs.
I cannot debug the problem with tcpdump, because it does not work. When
I try to run tcpdump, it gives this complain:
tcpdump: socket: Socket type not supported
I did not see anything about tcpdump in the file Changes. Do I need to 
upgrade it?
Please, give me any hint about how to debug this problem. I would like
to send a kernel patch, but I cannot do so without some help.
