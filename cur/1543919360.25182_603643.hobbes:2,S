the drivers are all opensource and the code is available.

For me the reason is that some drivers in the kernel which that driver
depends on are broken now. Those drivers got broken by several people
who disagree with me.
My conclusion after providing patches to fix those things is that I
won't run after those people anymore. I'm not going to have further
discussions with those people about it since there are enough other
outstanding things to do with that driver. After 1 1/2 years I'm just
fed up with it now and I want to continue to improve the driver.

it does not since it's broken and feature limited. On the other side
it requires a firmware from userspace too so I don't think it matters
at all if the algorithm is done in kernelspace or userspace since it
depends on such a blob (and I cannot get the source for that firmware,
if someone's interested in that he has to disassemble the firmware).
