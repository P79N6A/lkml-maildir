I'm no clean freak, but fiddling with scheduling information all over the 
place seems like a very bad idea. (before anyone says it, yes, we fiddle 
with state all over the place;)  I can imagine doing something dirty in 
driver code for specific cases (kdb/mouse are always interactivity 
indicators), but not in generic code.
Besides, the logical bindings for foo | bar | ... | baz do not exist in the 
kernel.  The kernel knows and cares only that single entities are using 
open/read/write/close primitives.  This is why I said I could _imagine_ a 
process struct... as the container for this missing (it lives in userland) 
information.
Another besides:  it makes zero difference it you add overhead to wakeup 
time or go to sleep time.  If it's something you do a lot of, adding 
overhead to it is going to hurt a lot.
