CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY was a concession to the fact that using ACPI for
processor discovery only was possible already, but in general an
all-or-nothing approach to ACPI is IMHO the safest bet.
So, let's assume in the very near future it becomes possible to compile a
kernel without MPS or $PIR support. Where should those config options go?
These, in addition to pnpbios, are also unneeded with ACPI. That is why I
was advocating the more general "Platform interface options" menu, so we
could have *one* place to config these and ACPI in or out, instead of having
the many different platform interface options in different logical areas.
