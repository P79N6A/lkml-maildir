really? if it was dual licensed (that's what I meant, perhaps the "or" 
should be an "and"? ;-), v2 in the kernel and v3(or any later version, 
etc.), if the code is used outside of the kernel, it would "fall back 
to" v3+ as soon as it's taken out of the kernel and used in something else.
If I'd want to contribute code to the kernel, I'd have to comply with 
the license of the kernel, which is v2 of the GPL. If I would actually 
prefer my code to be licensed under v3 or higher, I'd have to specify 
that my code is only licensed under v2 for the kernel to humour Linus 
Torvalds and respect the license of the kernel, but in all other ways 
the code is used, I only grant a license to copy under the conditions of 
the GPL v3 or higher. I don't see why that would affect the distribution 
of the kernel at all.
Cheers
Simon
