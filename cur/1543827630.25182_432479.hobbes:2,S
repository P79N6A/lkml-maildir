Depends on what you want to test, of course! I can't give you an answer
on that.
The thing about IO schedulers is that it's easy to provide good
throughput or good latency, but hard to do both. The tests you did so
far have x processes doing the same thing. Try something that has eg an
async writer going full throttle, and then a/some sync readers.
