It's nice to have something that's easy to use, but that's not a great
justification for addition to the kernel.  Esp. when there's a
functional userspace solution.

No, it doesn't support that.  I suppose it could, whether is should
is another matter.

Hrm, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.  The whole point of the
mlock rlimits code is to enable this policy to be pushed to userspace.
A generic method of enabling capabilities is the best way to go, long
term.  Any interest in pursuing that?
