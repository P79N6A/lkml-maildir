This is contrary to the documentation ("man socket").  The behavior
you describe is what I would expect for SOCK_SEQPACKET, not
SOCK_DGRAM.
Is the Linux behavior even consistent with POSIX?  You are saying that
SOCK_DGRAM behaves fundamentally differently for local connections
than for remote ones; in particular, the latter *do not block* while
the former do.  Even if this is standard, it ought to be documented
better...
I am pretty sure other Unixes do not behave like Linux does here (when
I ask for SOCK_DGRAM, I expect fast, non-blocking, unreliable
delivery), but perhaps I am wrong.
