You can't keep the ps->devsem lock and use ps->dev->serialize, because it
leads to deadlock.  Actually, simply replacing ps->devsem with ps->dev->serialize
cannot lead to any new deadlocks, it makes deadlocks that could occasionally
happen always happen (such deadlocks exist right now in usbfs).  Some of the
current deadlocks can be eliminated without giving up ps->devsem, but not all.
So the question is: must ps->dev->serialize be used?

No, because it needs to do operations on interfaces it hasn't claimed (such
as looking them up and claiming them).  This is why it needs to protect
itself, at least momentarily, against configurations shifting under it.  This
can be done by using the BKL more.  However it can be done more simply
using ps->dev->serialize (in fact it is simpler than what is there now).
By the way, if it is somehow fatal to do usb_put_dev after disconnect,
what is the point of referencing counting at all?  You might as well
free up the usb_device structure immediately after disconnect, since
there is sure to be a reference before disconnect, and (apparently)
there had better not be a reference after disconnect...
All the best,
Duncan.
