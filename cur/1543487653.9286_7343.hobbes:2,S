That depends what dial-up number you're using - some lines have
Ascends, yes, but others have USR/3COM units...specifically the
so-called "Purple ROMP", the 660 test line and the C&W ROMP (that
closes on 28th Feb 1999)...
The above information is from a good friend of mine, who prefers to be
known as Soruk when online...I'm not a Demon customer myself...
Best wishes from Riley.
