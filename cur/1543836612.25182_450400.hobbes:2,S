Say wha?
There's a lot you can do with the _representation_ of the on-disk format 
without changing the _physical_ on-disk format.  As a very simple 
example, a plugin could add a sysfs-like folder with information about 
that particular filesystem.  Yes, I know there are better ways to do 
things, but there are things you can change about behavior without (I 
think) touching the scheduler.
Or am I wrong about the scope of the "scheduler"?

Cryptocompress is compatible with kernels that have a working 
cryptocompress plugin.  Other kernels will notice that they are meant to 
be read by cryptocompress, and (I hope) refuse to read files they won't 
be able to.
Same would be true of any plugin that changes the disk format.
But, the above comments about behavior still hold.  There's a lot you 
can do with plugins without changing the on-disk format.  If you want a 
working example, look to your own favorite filesystems that support 
quotas, xattrs, and acls -- is an on-disk FS format with those enabled 
compatible with a kernel that doesn't support them (has them turned 
off)?  How about ext3, with its journaling -- is the journaling all in 
the scheduler?  But isn't the ext3 disk format compatible with ext2?

What is?  The FS?  I use neither on desktop machines, though I'd 
appreciate xattrs for Beagle.
Or are you talking about the plugins?  See above, then.
