Interesting, I wasn't aware of that.

Ok, that is the reason why the get_cycles_sync() function only exists on
x86_64 and not on i386, because on i386 gettimeofday() is a real
syscall?

The problem with KVM here is that they wan't to migrate guests between
Intel and AMD boxes. So they don't export RDTSCP or FEATURE_SYNC_TSC to
the guests in the CPUID calls. A 64bit Linux guest will execute the
CPUID in that function.
