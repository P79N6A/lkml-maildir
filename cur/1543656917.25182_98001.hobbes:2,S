You need to read about softirqs, but here is a quick explanation: there are
several points where softirqs are serviced, like bottom halves were in the
past (softirqs are much nicer), one example:
do_IRQ -> irq_exit -> do_softirq -> net_rx_action
So basically search for places calling do_softirq, they look if there is
softirqs pending and call do_softirq that will call the appropriate _action
function registered at softirq creation (look at net/core/dev.c, function
net_dev_init, line 2875.
