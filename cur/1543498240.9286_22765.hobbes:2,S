True, but Squid didn't exist, or wasn't well known in 1996.

Not enough for the CNN Web site, which is probably at least half a
terabyte of stories by now.  The large selection set of
frequently-viewed pages demands something more than simple buffer
cache.
cachefs comes in really handy, too, setting up "diskless" machines with
nothing but NFS cache and swap space.
