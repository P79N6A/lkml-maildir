Agreed. Someone could want to look at the data about the pci devices
_before_ the module is compiled, without needing to compile the module
or parsing C code.
I'm not sure if it will be worth, but it would be possible, for example,
to have a tool that says what modules you'll need to compile, just
looking at your hardware, at config time.
Just my 2 cents,
