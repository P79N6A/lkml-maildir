No, the current API would not support this.
These kind of features are a subset of general hardware support (rather
than simple arch specific extensions like the s390 stuff), which I think
we need to take into account before making changes to the API.
Perhaps we should set up a list specifically to discuss & implement the 
hardware crypto API, as there seem to be several disparate efforts going 
on.
