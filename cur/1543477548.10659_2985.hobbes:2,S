Subject: Mouse and Watchdog Timer options in wrong place in make xconfig.

In the v2.2.0-preX kernels, when using "make xconfig", the option to enable
Mouse support is in the "Character devices" section, rather than in the
"Mice" section.
Also, the options for QIC-02 tape support and Watchdog Timer Support show up
in the "Mice" section rather than where they belong.
