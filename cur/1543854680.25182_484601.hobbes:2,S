I don't think this is the right thing to do. This cannot be causing the
deadlock as for a deadlock you need (at least) two locks. Now, since any
calls from userspace to d80211 acquire the mutex first, they should be
fine. They also both acquire the rtnl lock first.
The deadlock must be somewhere deeper. Can we run this with lockdep
enabled? Might give us a hint before we dig out all the used locks
here...
