Hum, I think it's actually not necessary in this particular case when
(1) "the next contender is us" and (2) we are in the "ret != 0" path
so that the only thing we really care about -- if we were exclusivly
woken up, then wake up somebody else [*].
"the next contender is us" implies that we were still on the 'wq'
queue when __wake_up_bit() -> __wake_up() has been called, meaning
that wq->lock has also been taken (in __wake_up()).
Now, on our side, we are definitely on the 'wq' queue before calling
finish_wait(), meaning that we also take the wq->lock.
In short, wq->lock is a sync. mechanism in this case. The scheme is as follows:
our side:
[ finish_wait() ]
lock(wq->lock);
delete us from the 'wq'
unlock(wq->lock);
test_bit()   [ read a bit ]
waker's side:
clear_bit()
smp_mb__after_clear_bit() --- is a must to ensure that we fetch the
'wq' (and do a waitqueue_active(wq) check) in __wake_up_bit() _only_
after clearing the bit.
[ __wake_up_bit(); -> __wake_up() ] --> we are on the 'wq' (see conditions [*])
lock(wq->lock);
wake 'us' up here
unlock(wq->lock);
Now the point is, without smp_rmb() on the side of wait_on_bit(),
test_bit() [ which is a LOAD op ]can get _into_ the wq->lock section,
smth like this:
[ finish_wait() ]
lock(wq->lock);
test_bit()   [ read a bit ]
delete us from the 'wq'
unlock(wq->lock);
If (1) is true (we were woken up indeed), it means that __wake_up()
(from __wake_up_bit()) has been executed before we were able to enter
finish_wait().
By the moment __wake_up_bit() was executed (we were woken up), the bit
was already cleared -- that's guaranteed by a full MB on the
wake_up_bit side (in our case [*] wq->lock would do it even without
the MB) -> meaning that we don't miss !test_bit() int this particular
case [*].
p.s. if the explanation is vague or heh even wrong, it's definitely
due to the lack of sleep ;-))

yes, I think so.
