Hi all,
I'm a bit confused over 2.6 threading with respects to real time
scheduling settings...
In 2.6 all my threads appear as a single PID, if I use chrt -p <pid>
will it set the scheduling priority for my main thread or for all
threads in the application?
Can I used the thread IDs from /proc/<pid>/task/ to chrt the other
threads in my app to different priorities?
Thanks,
Dave.
