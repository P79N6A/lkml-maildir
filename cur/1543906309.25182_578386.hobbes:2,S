Hello Carlo.
The ranters! comment:
I can understand your way of looking at things.
But you'd better be a bit more careful with statements like these below, 
if you don't really know what's going on.
Just FYI: All possible traces - Ingo asked for - are on Ingos desk!
My intention is to support you folks as good as I can to get the issues solved.
As a user, with a rather limited knowledge about ck or cfs, I am just able to 
judge on the results these patches are delivering. 
I'll go always for the one  - if I have a choice - matching my requirements! 
Since there is just one patch left in the near future, at least the way it looks to me today, 
I am trying of course to support Ingo the best I can to identify potential issues.
Constructive critism - always welcome! 
Best regards
\Klaus
