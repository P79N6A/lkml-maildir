Fair enough.
I was misguided, that the return func had to be called.

Yep, trash it.
Seems that arg3 is not used here and since the timer is 64 bits, we can
store the bottom 32 bits in arg2 and the top in arg3 (this will work for
both 32 and 64 bit archs).
This will eliminate the need for kmalloc (I didn't like that solution
anyway).
New patch on its way (after I get some food to eat).
