Your problem is probably because read() need not actually read RAND_LEN
bytes.  Particularly with /dev/random, since it will only return bytes
up to the entropy estimate.  But you assume it read RAND_LEN, when those
are unread.  And possibly zero.  So that is probably your bug.
The AND makes zero sense, either.
Just use dd(1).
