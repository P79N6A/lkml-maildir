I hope you actually wrote serious proc-using code. If not, you should
not argue. I wrote the new ps, and I think /proc is a crawling horror.
My fix would be to add the exact same binary files that Solaris has
and to make all non-process information invisible. The filesystem
code could also be used for /sys or /kern, with a mount option to
show everything but the processes.

Parsing kernel data is evil. The native format is binary. Parsing is
something you do for human-supplied data.
I'd love to have the binary structures for C. In spite of being
100% C, "top" can use 50% of my CPU time. Real code is C anyway.

Damn right. BTW, some people feel a need to tweak the format!!!
Parsing assumptions get blown away when somebody does something
weird to the data, like adding whitespace where there was none
or changing the spelling of keywords in /proc/*/status.

Nope, most /proc access is does via programs written in C.
Humans are not happy with one kernel-supplied output format.

ROTFL!!!
The /proc/*/status keyword SigCat was changed to SigCgt.
This is fine for a human, but programs shouldn't have to deal
with this. Plain text in /proc costs you both reliability and
performance.

NO. The kernel API is not supposed to be "convenient" for humans.
The kernel API should not even be POSIX. The kernel API should be
as fast as possible. It should efficiently support POSIX, Java,
and even Win32. The C library should hide the kernel API, and there
should be tools that humans can use.
