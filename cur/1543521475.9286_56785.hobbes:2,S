Oh. My. God. They are requiring you to do WHAT??? Do you mean that you
really ship 2.3.x to your customers? Arrggh. "Source" == "source of what
we are shipping". And not "anything that was written by other guys who
started from the same source". It's utter nonsense. _No_ license can
oblige you to include the modifications done by somebody else. Otherwise
you'ld have those drivers in the main tree, BTW - _that_ much should be
clear even for your LD.

You do realize that stability of the system doesn't exceed that of the
weakest link, don't you? You _are_ shipping untested software if you are
shipping 2.3.whatever + your drivers. It's called unstable for a good
reason. Ouch... OK, what if Linus will put a
pre-patch-2.3.39-dont-even-think-of-using-it-anywhere-near-your-data-3.gz
on ftp.kernel.org tomorrow? Will your LD require you to ship _that_? No?
Is the notion of 'untested software' completely alien to them?
BTW, you could point them to Debian or RH - none of them ships the 2.3.x
in released versions _and_ it's not even the latest 2.2.x existing. Hell,
Debian 2.1 is shipped with 2.0 - switch to 2.2 is in potato (== Debian 2.2
to be). RH uses 2.2.12, AFAICS (with a lot of patches). And all of them
have darn good reasons to do so - stability being the first one. Is there
any chance to get your legal folks talking with RH lawyers? Or Caldera, or
Corel ones...

Which might mean that repository of pointers to 3rd-party drivers (along
with the contact info) might be Good Thing(tm).
I would suggest the following: keep this information in DNS (RBL-like
scheme; i.e. <driver_name>.<author_or_company_name>.drivers.linux.org
having TXT record with URL and kernel version(s) in the body). Then all
you need is (a) standard address (e.g. update@drivers.linux.org) aliased
to the script; (b) said script verifying (PGP, GPG, whatever) the source
of mail and updating the record. IOW, all it really takes is somebody with
nameserver, clue and decent connectivity. Any takers?
