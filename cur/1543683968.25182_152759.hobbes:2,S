Thanks. When using "make oldconfig", every time I have to press
enter to continue for:
  BT848 Video For Linux (CONFIG_VIDEO_BT848) [N/m/?] (NEW) 
This is the case for the last couple of pre releases I tested (currently using
pre8 & compiling pre9). It looks like the option is not saved in the
.config file.
Otherwise the compilation with my .config works without human intervention.

I will reserve some CPU cycles.
