Hi!
A while ago I have seen someone here talk about a tool for
nondestructively adding a new partition to an existing raid0 set, which
afterwards seems to have grown in size, but all the contained information
is still on it, and if using ext2 on it, w/ e2resize it also can be
expanded.
Now can you please tell me, if and where is it available, and how stable
it is?
