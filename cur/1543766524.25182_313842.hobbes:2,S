Andrew,
Libor Michalek posted a much more reasonable (to my limited
understanding) bug description in <20050412180447.E6958@topspin.com>.
(And I'd love to provide a URL, but damned if I can figure out how to
find that message on gmane.  Clue-bat applications gladly accepted.)

# The driver did use get_user_pages() to elevated the refcount on all the

# The problem we were seeing is that the minor fault by the app resulted
# in a new physical page getting mapped for the application. The page that
# had the elevated refcount was still waiting for the data to be written
# to by the driver at the time that the app accessed the page causing the
# minor fault. Obviously since the app had a new mapping the data written
# by the driver was lost.
# 
# It looks like code was added to try_to_unmap_one() to address this, so   
# hopefully it's no longer an issue...
Which makes me think that Timur's bug is just an
insufficiently-understood version of Libor's.
