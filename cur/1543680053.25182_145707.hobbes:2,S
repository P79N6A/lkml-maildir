The dmesg output shows both CPUs being put online.
/proc/cpuinfo lists both CPUs too
I don't use ACPI, even though I enabled it in the BIOS so I could use
acpismp=force (else the kernel finds no ACPI table of course).
I will see if disabling it in the BIOS helps, I will check it tomorrow
(I have to let the array be rebuilt anyway).

Hm, I don't want anything to do with ACPI actually :)
Anything that could give me a lock free smp machine with a working 3ware
card, would make me happy. 
I hope I don't have to wait for the 2.6 series to have a stable machine.
best regards,
Vincent
