Happy cherrypicking.

I am not sure, but I would tend to say "no".
kallsyms.c:
	p1 = table[i].sym;                                              
                                                                                
	/* find the token on the symbol */                              
	p2 = memmem(p1, len, str, 2);                                   
	if (!p2) continue;                                              
My first impression would be that 'p1' is a multi-nul-terminated string
array ("foo\0bar\0next\0symbol\0..."), much like the entire .strtab
section (I have not actually bothered to check, so it is a raw guess), and
I do not think strstr would replace memmem here if that was the case.

Humm humm. Linux's /usr/include does not have any (glibc) file with the
string __EXTENSIONS__ in it. Though, the linux manpage for fileno() does
not mention fileno() conforming to anything. Under Linux, fileno() is
wrapped inside __USE_POSIX, and the comments in Solaris's headers also
indicate it is something posixy.
Perhaps have something like
#ifdef __sun__
#	define __EXTENSIONS__ 1
#endif

Exactly.

How much do we want to support Solaris anyway? It's like trying to make
ICC a thoroughly supported compiler. Hey, do we want to support GCC
compilation under BSD too? What about CYGWIN - there have been efforts
before! :p  Seriously, what build platforms do we want to support in
the near future?
Thanks,
Jan
