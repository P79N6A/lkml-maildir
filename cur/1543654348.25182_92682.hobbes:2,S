Hi Wang,
	Thanks for the bug report, but I think you misunderstand.
symbol_get() does not take a string, it takes an identifier.  This
way, we can ensure the type is correct.  eg.
	/* In header somewhere. */
	extern int their_integer;
	....
		int *ptr = symbol_get(their_integer);
		if (!ptr) ...
Does that help?
Rusty.
