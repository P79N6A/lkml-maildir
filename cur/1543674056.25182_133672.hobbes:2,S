Only if you program it wrongly. Its not exactly hard.
As to an interface. The simplest is probably
	request_firmware()
and
	request_firmware_nowait(......, workqueuehandler)
The issues brought up about it failing appear bogus too, if the hotplug
run returns a non zero exit code you know about this already.
