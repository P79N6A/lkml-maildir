Nope, in general the saw-off is that signal processing and protocol
implementations that are beyond a few bits of logic are done in userspace.
The exceptions are echo cancellation (which has to be done very close to
the itnerface) and RBS protocols which are easy and important enough to be
done in the kernel.  DTMF detection and the FSK modems for Caller*ID and
ADSI are done in userspace, as well as the PRI implementation (libpri).

:)  Just look at "zaptel" as being the kernel interface and "zapata" as
being the user-level interface.  Biased as I am, of course, I think that
Asterisk is the most interesting application of the technology but not
everyone seems to agree ;-)
A direct link to the whitepaper is:

Actually, Linux right out of the box on modern PC hardware (400+Mhz) seems
more than fine for the task.  We even have people running this on 200Mhz
cyrix machines (single channels) and I've been able to driver a T1 on a
233 Mhz PII, although I don't think I'd recommend this configuration
officially!  I'd be happy to see what hard-realtime might be able to do in
terms of pushing the hardware requirements even lower, but it seems pretty
exciting just as it is!
One more thing that might be interesting would be seeing how small we
could push the "chunk size".  Right now, we use a chunk size of 8, but
a chunk size of 1 (that is, interrupting for EVERY sample) would put us
at a level indistinguishable from hard TDM.
