It appears that you're using some variant of the 2.6.7 kernel, yes?
That kernel (and many preceding ones) will create large pty indexes and old
(and/or buggy) userspace fails to handle it correctly.
Post-2.6.7, the allocation of pty indexes was switched to first-fit and
things should now work OK.
Please test a current kernel and send a report.
2.6.7 plus
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/patch-2.6.7-bk9.gz
would be suitable.
