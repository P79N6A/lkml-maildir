Ah, I think what's the keyboard problem. If I don't have usb compiled into
the kernel, my keyboard shows stuck keys continuously. I just posted my .config

Cool, I'll check it out.

Excellent, I'll try it out as well for the PCMCIA.
Here's a bios patch that gets rid of one error and allows the machine to
boot with ioapic option. I've not yet verified that it's this patch though.
With ioapic, the USB and network interrupts stop working, so there's
something else.
