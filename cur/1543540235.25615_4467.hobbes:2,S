Linus,
A while ago, it was suggested that the assembler rule ought to be
moved into Rules.make.
Looking at what the various architectures do, this may cause breakage
for these architectures.  eg, look in arch/i386/lib/Makefile:
.S.o:
        $(CC) $(AFLAGS) -c $< -o $*.o
and compare that with the following rule:
--- linux-orig/Rules.make	Sat Jun 24 10:54:37 2000
+++ linux/Rules.make	Fri Jul 28 16:48:15 2000
@@ -61,6 +61,9 @@
 %.o: %.s
 	$(AS) $(ASFLAGS) $(EXTRA_CFLAGS) -o $@ $<
 
+%.o: %.S
+	$(CC) $(AFLAGS) $(AFLAGS_$@) -traditional -c -o $@ $<
+
 #
 #
 #
Let me know if you want to suffer breakage of these other architectures
and "do the job properly", or whether you'd prefer to receive a fix for
the drivers/acorn/* subdirs.  I think I know you'd prefer the former.
(At the moment, the asm stuff in drivers/acorn/* is uncompilable without
the addition of additional patches).
