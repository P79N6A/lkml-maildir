Subject: Patch for removing 2TB RAID1 component limit (for pre 2.6.16)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have googled, looked through release notes, and investigated everywhere I 
know to investigate, so I'm hoping this short note will find the help I need.
I am working on a Redhat-based system (CentOS) and would like to compile the 
kernel to support RAID1 components larger than 2TB (5.1TB in this case).  I 
know the 2TB limitation went away somewhere in 2.6.16, but I cannot find any 
reference to the patch or the change in the ChangeLogs.  Is it as simple as 
replacing everything in /md, or is there more involved?
I've tried experiment with 5.6 TB sparse files, but even on systems where I 
have 5.1TB raid components working, try to do this:
mdadm -C /dev/md10 --auto=yes -l raid1 -n2 sparsefile1 sparsefile2
returns:
mdadm: Cannot open sparsefile1: File too large
mdadm: Cannot open sparsefile2: File too large
mdadm: create aborted
So, I can't determine experimentally whether or not the patch has been 
included, nor whether or not a 5.1TB component would work.
So, any tips, pointers, or patches for the large MD devices?
Thanks!
