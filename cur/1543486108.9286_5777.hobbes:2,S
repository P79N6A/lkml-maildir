Digital Unix on Alpha, and I think Alpha Linux as well (sorry, work
machine), long is 32.
The C standard doesn't let you assume anything like your post,
although they're often true.  Certainly, if you only program on DOS
(as did the people who wrote one program I had to deconstruct today),
you can assume all that, and for much of Linux's life, it was safe.
But no longer, and it'll become less safe as time goes on.
(I found myself doing a 
#define long int
in a piece of code because so conflated long with 32 bits.  It caused
me great torment, but it worked.)
