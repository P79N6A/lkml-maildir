IMHO, that's nothing but a cover for the weaknesses induced by using 
exclusively sleep time as an information source for the priority 
calculation.  While this heuristic does work pretty darn well, it's easily 
fooled (intentionally or otherwise).  The challenge is to find the right 
low cost informational component, and to stir it in at O(1).
The fundamental problem with the whole interactivity issue is that the 
kernel has no way to know if there's a human involved or not.  My 100%cpu 
GL screensaver is interactive while I'm mindlessly staring at it.
