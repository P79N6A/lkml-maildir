Don't you just need to READ memory?  The memory controller hardware 
takes care of the rest in the vast majority of cases.
You only need to rewrite RAM if a correctable error occurs, and the 
chipset doesn't support automatic write-back of the corrected value (a 
different problem altogether...).  The actual memory bits themselves are 
refreshed by the hardware quite frequently (max of every 64ms for DDR2, 
I believe)...
Cheers,
Tim.
