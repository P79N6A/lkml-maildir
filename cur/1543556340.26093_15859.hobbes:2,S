Yep. It assumes that if the required randommness numbers aren't met a read
to /dev/random will block.
And it's not the only program that assumes this : I also did. 
/dev/random is called a blocking random device, which more or less implies
that it will totally block. I suggest we put this somewhere in the kernel
docs, since lots of people out there assume that it totally blocks.
Means I've got to updates some sources of mine :)
