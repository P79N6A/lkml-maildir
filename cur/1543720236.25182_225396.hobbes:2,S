 Thanks for the patch
 Unfortunately that didn't do the trick. It does not even suspend
 sometimes when hitting the suspend button. This is very strange.
 It reproducible does not resume the second time.  Seems like
 the system has been left in an unstable state after the first
 suspend/resume cycle. I'm definitely not the born hardware/BIOS
 programmer although I have been involved in graphic device
 programming (a pain) but in this this case which is a real pain I
 would be willing to at least help by further debugging the issue.
 Kernel 2.4.x proved that the BIOS can be talked into properly
 interacting with linux. So it's at least not totally brain dead.
 One might argue that the hardware is already a little bit out dated
 but I really do not have the resources to buy a new
 laptop every year and  it  also represents some kind of masochistic
 challenge to get this thing going.  But I really do not know how
 to debug the stuff or where to look.
 Any hints how to proceed would be highly appreciated
 Sebastian
