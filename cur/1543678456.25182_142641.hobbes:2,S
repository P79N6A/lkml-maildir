Subject: [PATCH][2.5.73] restore UP spinlock workaround for gcc-2.95.3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/23/112

[Sent to Linus and Andi, forgot to cc: lkml]
This patch reverts Andi's change to include/linux/spinlock.h
which made gcc-2.95 use empty structs and empty initializers for
spinlocks on UP. gcc-2.95.3 requires the workaround. Please apply.
A short boot-rebuild-kernel-reboot cycle with 2.5.73 compiled
with gcc-2.95.3 resulted in five "Unitialized timer!" stack
traces on my P4, the first three during boot+init. Recompiling
with gcc-3.2.2, or with 2.95.3 and Andi's patch reverted,
eliminated these problems.
At least on x86 gcc-2.95.3 compiles faster and generates smaller
object code than 3.x.y for at lot of us, so I'd prefer to restore
the workaround rather than deprecating 2.95.3.
