When did you need a magic constant NO_IRQ in generic code.
One of the reasons I want to convert the drivers is so we can
kill the NO_IRQ nonsense.
As for struct irq.  Instead of struct irq_desc I really don't
care, although the C++ camp hasn't not yet weighed in and mentioned
how that creates a namespace conflict for them.

We might need this.  But I don't think we need reference counting in
the traditional sense.  For all practical purpose we already have
dynamic irq allocation and it hasn't proven necessary.  I would
prefer to go to lengths to avoid having to expose that kind of
an issue to driver code.

Well I just find that comment cute, in the current context :)
I actually don't like the idea of having two version of the
infrastructure or for that matter any driver visible changes except
the type change at the same time.
That makes the conversion much harder because you have to think about
the change.  If I have to go in touch a huge percentage of the drivers
I don't want to have to think, I don't want something I have to code
review.  I want something that any first grader can do correct so when
I am fatigued after having converted 1000 drivers I can still get it
right, and so that there is a chance I don't have to convert drivers.
But otherwise I agree we seem to be largely on the same wavelength.
I also don't like infrastructure changes that never get finished,
which is the big danger with providing a backwards compatibility
API.  Some drivers just never adapt to what is new and better.
I think with a little care I can get 99% of the drivers compile
tested by enabling everything in the kernel (allyesconfig?)  
I guess when it comes to that I will have to see if I'm crazy or not.
