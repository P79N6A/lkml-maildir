We're straying from the subject here. Please describe your machine,
in terms of how many cpus it has and how much highmem it has, and
your workload, so I can better determine the issue. Perhaps we can
cooperatively devise something that works well for you.
Or perhaps the kernel version is not up-to-date. Please also provide
the precise kernel version (and included patches). And workload too.
Thanks,
Bill
