Yeah.... I don't know. OTOH it would be more logical to enable
MAXSMP iff UV is enabled (or change the MAXSMP limits for when
UV is enabled). Or you could select Intel CPUs if UV is enabled,
or disable GRU if UV is not set etc etc.
I didn't want to get too fancy with config options because arbitrary
linkages seem to just cause headaches. I figure if someone wants
to enable it, they can do so.
