the sysadmin shouldn't do that.  sysfs is needed for proper operation
in a modern system and there's nothing to hid in there.

I didn't say we should make using the loopback driver a non-privilegued
operation.

It just mean that a) the system admin should be careful what drivers are
loaded and b) we need to audit block based filesystems better.
Note that in many current distributions users can mount iso9660 filesystems
through user mount hacks already.  Accessible to everyone and in the global
namespace.
