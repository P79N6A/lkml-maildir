Great testcase! Note that we already do RT-overload wakeups further 
below:
                /*
                 * If a newly woken up RT task cannot preempt the
                 * current (RT) task then try to find another
                 * CPU it can preempt:
                 */
                if (rt_task(p) && !TASK_PREEMPTS_CURR(p, rq)) {
                        smp_send_reschedule_allbutself();
                        rt_overload_wakeup++;
                }
what i think happened is that the above logic misses the case you have 
described in detail, and doesnt mark the current CPU for rescheduling. 
I.e. it sends an IPI to all _other_ CPUs, including the 'wrong target' - 
but it doesnt mark the current CPU for reschedule - hence if the current 
CPU is the only right target we might fail to handle this task!
could you try the (untested) patch below, does it solve your testcase 
too?
