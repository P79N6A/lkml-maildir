No, I've not investigated this scenario. It looks like you are right and my
patch can leads to a long delays.
In my experiments I've decreased ip_conntrack_max lower than number of hash
buckets and got the "table full, dropping packet" errors in logs. I've looked on
the conntrack list and found a huge number of conntracks that can be freed.
However my hash bucket was empty and therefore I even did not have any chances
to free something. That's why I would like to check the other hash buckets too.
Ok, let's limit the number of conntracks that can be checked inside
early_drop(). What do you prefer: some round number (for example 100) or
fraction of ip_conntrack_max (for example 1%)?
Thank you,
