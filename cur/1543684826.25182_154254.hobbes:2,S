It's entirely software RAID, and as much, doesn't offer anything over
existing Linux software RAID ("md" driver).
I'm sure someone will eventually support it, but since Linux software
RAID works just fine, right now, in production, there is little
motivation to create yet another vendor-proprietary software RAID.
