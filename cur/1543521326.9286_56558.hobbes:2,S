vmalloc is sloww, especially on SMP computer because it must unconditionally
flush all tlb's on all cpu's. I'd prefer a linked list, each entry up to
PAGE_SIZE. Either kmalloc'ed(), or kmalloc + gfp().
And: move the lock_kernel() calls as near a possible to the actual do_poll()
calls. You don't need the big kernel lock for the memory allocations or the
copy_from_user() calls.
