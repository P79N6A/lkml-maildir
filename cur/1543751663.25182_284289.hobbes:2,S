But the result looks ugly
I keep core0 and core1 of node0 to use 0/1 got
4407.29 BogoMIPS (lpj=2203648)
CPU: L1 I Cache: 64K (64 bytes/line), D cache 64K (64 bytes/line)
CPU: L2 Cache: 1024K (64 bytes/line)
CPU 7 -> Node 3
phy_proc_id[0] = 0
phy_proc_id[1] = 0
phy_proc_id[2] = 9
phy_proc_id[3] = 9
phy_proc_id[4] = 10
phy_proc_id[5] = 10
phy_proc_id[6] = 11
phy_proc_id[7] = 11
CPU: Physical Processor ID: 11
 stepping 00
Total of 8 processors activated (35209.21 BogoMIPS).
If only keep core0/node0 to use 0.
Will get
phy_proc_id[0] = 0
phy_proc_id[1] = 8
phy_proc_id[2] = 9
phy_proc_id[3] = 9
phy_proc_id[4] = 10
phy_proc_id[5] = 10
phy_proc_id[6] = 11
phy_proc_id[7] = 11
it separate core0 and core1 of node 1

I'm not convinced we do. Things seem to work with BSP APIC-ID = 0.
Is there any real reason to not just require that?

Early PCI scan would work in the worst case. All Opterons have a builtin
northbridge with a specific ID.  There is already other code that 
checks for these.
