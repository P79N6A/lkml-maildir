That's on an 8-bit channel, as used on Clawhammer (AMD's lower cost
CPU for desktop market). The spec allows 2, 4, 6, 16 or 32-bit
channels. If I recall correctly, the AMD presentation at OLS said
Sledgehammer (server market) uses 16-bit.

I'm not so sure. Clawhammer has two links, can do dual-CPU. One link
to the other CPU, one for I/O. Latency may well be negligible there.
Sledgehammer has three links, can do no-glue 4-way with each CPU
using two links to talk to others, one for I/O.
    I/O -- A ------ B -- I/O
           |        |
           |        |
    I/O -- C ------ D -- I/O
They can also go to no-glue 8-way:
    I/O -- A ------ B ------ E ------ G -- I/O
           |        |        |        |
           |        |        |        |
    I/O -- C ------ D ------ F ------ H -- I/O
I suspect latency may become an issue when more than one link is
involved and there can be contention.
Beyond 8-way, you need glue logic (hypertransport switches?) and
latency seems bound to become an issue.
