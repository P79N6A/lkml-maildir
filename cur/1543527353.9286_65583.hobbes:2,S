Nope, the state of the art back then was to poke around in /dev/kmem,
guided by a possibly obsolete symbol table, and blissfully ignorant of
any locking or such.
Whenever any of the kernel-internal tables changed, ps and friends
died a horrible death or started generating strangely incorrect
information, and there was a week of confusion in linux-kernel.
With the introduction of /proc, it became possible to write utilities
that didn't need to be updated twice a month. That's why we have a
decent collection of proc-related utilities now. (For the record, the
average release interval of psmisc is approximately half a year and
the last change for proc compatibility was in February '98. That much
about the oh so terribly fragile text files.)
I don't remember any system calls that disappeared because of /proc.
