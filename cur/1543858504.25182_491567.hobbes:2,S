ACK, I agree completely.  I think its a silly, political, non-technical 
decision being pushed here.
For the record, I also disagree with the sneaky backdoor way people want 
to add EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() to key subsystems that drivers will need. 
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() is more to emphasize that certain symbols are more 
'internal' or frequently changed, and therefore use of them would imply 
you are using a derived work of the kernel.  EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() is 
/not/ a place for political activism either.
