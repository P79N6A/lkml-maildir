I'm compiling without reslabify now.
I got 
patching file arch/i386/mm/pageattr.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 67 (offset 9 lines).
when backing it out - is this the effect of
some other patch touching the same file or could
my source be wrong somehow?
Which patch is the netfilter cset?  None of
the patches in mm2 looked obvious to me.  Or
is it part of the linus patch? Note that mm1
works for me, so anything found there too
isn't as likely to be the problem.
