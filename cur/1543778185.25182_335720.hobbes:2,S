Hi,
currently, i'm using the ondemand governor. My CPU supports the
frequencies 800, 1800 and 2000 MHz (AMD Athlon64 Desktop with
Cool&Quiet). The simple bash commands
  while true
  do
    true
  done
cause 100% CPU usage, and the CPU immediatly switched from 800 to 2000MHz.
Using the conservative govenor, nothing happens. I would expect, that
the cpu switches to 1800 and than to 2000 Mhz after some seconds of full
CPU usage.
What's wrong?
My guess is, that the conservative govenor would need more frequencies
between 800 and 1800MHz to work properly.
Thx
  Sven
