They can be difficult (I know, I write them :)
With a good design ahead of time, it isn't that bad though.
Which kind of funny, for the types of multithreaded programs I'm
writing,
LinuxThreads has done better on my tests than 95/NT.  Which one of the 
biggest boosts I saw under linux was actually in what I see as proper
thread scheduling.  That is if I have 10 threads ready to execute the
order
in which they run is fairly random.  NT was more predeictable.  Makes it
harder to test for race conditions.  Also, I have been really
unimpressed
with NT's SMP support, I got a dual P166 a while back and NT barely ran
as fast as a single P166.  Nuked NT, installed linux on it.  WOW...
Impressive.  I'm even running the 2.0 series... :)
Only thing I haven't liked about LinuxThreads so far isn't a linux
problem,
but a posix one.  There are some primitives in win32 I miss in posix
threads
area.  But, I almost have port of my semaphores to linux ready (adds 
extensions to pthreads), so I guess that complaint is going away too...
