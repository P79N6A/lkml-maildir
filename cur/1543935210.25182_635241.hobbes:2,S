Hi,
I've notice this hang on bootup every so often. Sometimes it hangs for a
second and sometimes it can hang for hours. Always at the same location.
This is a soft hang. That is, interrupts are still enabled, and I'm able
to perform a sysrq-t.
Here's the problem child:

This happens after it installed cpu_idle_ladder, and later while
installing cpu_idle_menu it hangs. But it's not the menu that is the
problem. But it looks like the cpu_idle_wait is.
In cpu_idle from process_32.c we have:
		while (!need_resched()) {
			void (*idle)(void);
			if (__get_cpu_var(cpu_idle_state))
				__get_cpu_var(cpu_idle_state) = 0;
			check_pgt_cache();
			rmb();
			idle = pm_idle;
			if (!idle)
				idle = default_idle;
			if (cpu_is_offline(cpu))
				play_dead();
			__get_cpu_var(irq_stat).idle_timestamp = jiffies;
			idle();
		}
and in cpu_idle_wait:
	set_cpus_allowed(current, cpumask_of_cpu(this_cpu));
	put_cpu();
	cpus_clear(map);
	for_each_online_cpu(cpu) {
		per_cpu(cpu_idle_state, cpu) = 1;
		cpu_set(cpu, map);
	}
	__get_cpu_var(cpu_idle_state) = 0;
	wmb();
	do {
		ssleep(1);
		for_each_online_cpu(cpu) {
			if (cpu_isset(cpu, map) && !per_cpu(cpu_idle_state, cpu))
				cpu_clear(cpu, map);
		}
		cpus_and(map, map, cpu_online_map);
	} while (!cpus_empty(map));
Basically, we set cpu_idle_state to one for each online cpu. Clear the
cpu that is currently running. Then keep sleeping and wait till each cpu
passes the cpu_idle and clears the cpu_idle_state per_cpu variable.
The problem I see here, especially in boot up, is that it doesn't check
to see if a cpu is already idle.  So if a CPU is idle and NO_HZ is set
(yes I have that set), we can shut down an online CPU if there's no
interrupts to run nor any threads to run. Which is the case on bootup.
I first thought about adding an "in_idle" per_cpu variable to check, but
then I'm thinking that this can cause other races. Because this is used
in the idle governor code, and that code can also be a module, we might
remove the idle code when CPUS are still using it.  So perhaps a simple
smp_call_function to an empty function might be good enough. Something
like this?

Thoughts?
Disclaimer: I've been seeing this when working with the mcount patches.
So I haven't seen it on a vanilla git repo. But... I haven't been
booting vanilla git repos, and this hang doesn't look related to mcount.
Another problem is that this hang only happens once every 100 boots or
so.
