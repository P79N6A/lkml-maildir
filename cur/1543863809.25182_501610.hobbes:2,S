Good, that was nasty ...

That rings a bell.

Just so we don't lose count here:  this is the *third* example of
an SPI protocol tweaking option that seems to be needed just to
support an MMC-over-SPI stack:
 - Claiming the SPI bus so that chipselect can stay high even
   between spi_message interactions (although you seemed not to
   run into that one);
 - Efficiency in the routine "poll for status" operation, where
   data must be read over MISO (CS high) until 0xff bytes stop;
 - This issue, where a deselected device must be clocked.
I knew that not every SPI controller driver would be able to
support that particular stack...

At a first glance, this seems like a reasonable approach.
Let me think about it a bit.  The ability for a controller
driver to advertise a capability is reasonable, but so far
it hasn't been used with SPI.  (It ought to suffice just to
reject unsupported requests, modulo the issue of trying to
sort out exactly what was unsupported.)

Right.  Unfortunately there's not a lot of protocol tweaking
support we can currently expect to be "mandatory".  Testing
such requirements would be problematic too.

There's no "chip select" feature in the API.  It's only part of
the protocol described by messages delivered to the controller
driver.  Don't confuse the "bitbang" framework (which works with
more than just bitbanged hardware, of course) with the API; it's
just an implementation aid, and not one that all implementors
would choose to use.

Sounds fair.
