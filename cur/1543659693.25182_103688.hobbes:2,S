They are indeed simple, but only because it's impossible to implement
anything more complex.
An example: A "rmmod -w loop" will currently deadlock on a busy loop
module. Could you please explain, how it will be possible to force a
safe removal of the loop module?

What is the problem with a half unloaded module? Only the module knows
which interfaces it can safely remove to prevent new users, afterwards
it only has to wait for remaining user to leave to complete the cleanup.
BTW this also solves nicely the module init race.
