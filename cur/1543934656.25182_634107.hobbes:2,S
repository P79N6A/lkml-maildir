On closer look the safer test is:
	!test_bit(STRIPE_OP_COMPUTE_BLK, &sh->ops.pending).
The 'req_compute' field only indicates that a 'compute_block' operation
was requested during this pass through handle_stripe so that we can
issue a linked chain of asynchronous operations.

md: Fix data corruption when a degraded raid5 array is reshaped.
We currently do not wait for the block from the missing device
to be computed from parity before copying data to the new stripe
layout.
The change in the raid6 code is not techincally needed as we
don't delay data block recovery in the same way for raid6 yet.
But making the change now is safer long-term.
This bug exists in 2.6.23 and 2.6.24-rc
