You shouldn't need atapi_enabled=1 anymore, and combined_mode only 
applies if you're using an Intel controller with that 
combined/legacy/AHCI selection braindamage. Did you select the right 
driver options in the kernel configuration? You'll either have to 
compile the driver(s) into the kernel or potentially do some 
distro-specific magic to ensure the modules get loaded in the initrd.
