Disagreed. It is a bug and needs to panic machines.

Actually that's wrong. Because I fixed that code long ago if
you mean the access in battery.c
(if you search the ACPI mailing list for my name you should find it)
And there was no AML code involved here.
For some reason the ACPI guys didn't merge my patch though,
but that just needs to be revisited.
