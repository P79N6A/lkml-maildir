It's not that you might forget to revise your configuration, but that 
the vast majority of users will not revise anything, and still expect 
things to "just work".  Kind of like multi-band cell phones.  
This isn't that big of a deal in the 2.4GHz band, but when you start
talking about 5GHz, especially in France, things get a lot trickier.
Of course, all of this automagic "just work" crap only affects the STAs. 
For AP operation, we have to trust the user to set the correct locale --
I don't see any way of including a sane "just-works" default in the
stock kernel.org tree, so I think the default should be be "none".  This
way the user is forced to explicitly set the regdomain in order for the
AP startup to succeed.
...and pray that the AP isn't migrating to a different regdomain, but 
there's really nothing anyone can do about that.
