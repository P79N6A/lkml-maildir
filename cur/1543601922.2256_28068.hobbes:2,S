1)
  I think I saw some BIOS report DMA0 for "none" (could even have
  been ACPI which is returning PNP formatted legacy resource data).
2)
  I have never seen DMA0 for parport configured by a BIOS.
3)
  Try "lssuperio" if you want the real hardware thing.
This qualifies the code as it is as a sanity check.
