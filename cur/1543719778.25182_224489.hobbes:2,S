Hi,
As far as I understand devices in Linux, device file is only some kind of 
note to the *local* kernel that operations on that file is to be 
redirected to the device. It is always resolved by the local kernel and 
redirected to the local device (if tere is driver that claims this 
major/minor number). Life would be to simple...
