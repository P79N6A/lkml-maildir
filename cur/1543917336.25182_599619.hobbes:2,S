For the "most" performance connection, the ULP would use IB, and all these
problems go away.  :)
This proposal is for each iwarp interface to have its own IP address.  Clients
would need an iwarp usable address of the server and would connect using
rdma_connect().  If that call (or rdma_resolve_addr/route) fails, the client
could try connecting using sockets, aoi, or some other interface.  I don't see
that Steve's proposal changes anything from the client's perspective.
