Let's not confuse owner with user and let's not confuse ownership of
copyrights with ownership of particular copies.

No. The copyright to the software is owned by those people. But particular
copies of copyrighted items can be owned by other people.

That's right, they do have that right so long as they condition it on the
exercise of something I could not do without their permission. (Ignoring for
the moment the fact that the software is a derivative work of GPL'd
software.)
I'm not sure whether you think this disagrees with or refutes anything I've
said.
