When memory add was merged into mainline in 2.6.14, there were
various bits and pieces missing that prevent it from working on
ppc64.  The following patches are against 2.6.14-git7 and address
all but one of the know issues.
1) Create hptes for new sections
2) Clear page count before freeing new pages
3) Kludge to add new memory to node 0
4) Ensure probe file is created for memory add via sysfs
