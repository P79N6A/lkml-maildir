I'm no gcc expert but afaik this really needs unit-at-a-time. (someone
who knows more about gcc please correct me if I'm wrong).
On the good news side:
-f-unit-at-a-time can be enabled for gcc 4.x; the stack bug that caused
it to be disabled is fixed in gcc 4.x
and .. -ffunction-sections may well be a good thing anyway; that works
even for non-statics.
(but iirc it needs some linker script changes because sections change
name)
