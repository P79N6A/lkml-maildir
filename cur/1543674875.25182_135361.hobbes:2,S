Well, things are better since I upgraded to 2.5.69-bk14
I haven't been able to cause an oops, and up until just a minute ago
things seemed to be working fine.  But on my latest sync attempt, I got
this in the dmesg log:
hub 1-0:0: debounce: port 2: delay 100ms stable 4 status 0x101
hub 1-0:0: new USB device on port 2, assigned address 3
usb 1-2: USB device not accepting new address=3 (error=-110)
hub 1-0:0: new USB device on port 2, assigned address 4
usb 1-2: USB device not accepting new address=4 (error=-110)
hub 1-0:0: debounce: port 2: delay 100ms stable 4 status 0x101
hub 1-0:0: new USB device on port 2, assigned address 5
usb 1-2: USB device not accepting new address=5 (error=-110)
hub 1-0:0: new USB device on port 2, assigned address 6
usb 1-2: USB device not accepting new address=6 (error=-110)
and the sync failed.
I'll be upgrading to -bk[latest] later today anyway, and will let you
know if I see further problems with visor USB hotsync...
