Back in October 2007, this thread to which I am now (Jan 2008)
responding had a discussion of realtime versus normal load balancing
and how to setup sched domains for this, perhaps using cpusets.
Thanks to Peter Zijlstra, this discussion has started up again on lkml,
in the new thread:

Come on over and join the fun if you like.
