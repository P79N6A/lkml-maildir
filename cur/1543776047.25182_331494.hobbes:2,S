The reason for creating a kernel mount of selinuxfs at that point is so
that the selinuxfs_mount vfsmount and selinux_null dentry are available
for flush_unauthorized_files to use.

We need to be able to assign specific security labels to specific inodes
in selinuxfs, particularly for the booleans, but ideally for any of
them.
Userspace compatibility is obviously a concern for such a change.
libselinux determines where selinuxfs is mounted during library
initialization by checking /proc/mounts for selinuxfs, and rc.sysinit
does likewise.  /sbin/init performs the initial mount of selinuxfs prior
to initial policy load.  Further, the existence of selinuxfs
in /proc/filesystems is used as a test of whether SELinux was enabled in
the kernel (e.g. is_selinux_enabled in libselinux).
I'm not sure such a change is worthwhile for SELinux; large amount of
disruption for little real gain.
