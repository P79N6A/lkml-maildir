Oh, btw - another thing:
 when you re-send with a non-broken mailer, could you please also change
all the duplication of the
+                               /*
+                                 *  If this task is in a thread group, make sure
+                                 *  this signal kills all tasks in the group.
+                                 */
+                                if (info.si_code != SI_TKILL) {
+                                        struct task_struct *task;

+                                       for_each_thread(task) {
+                                                force_sig_info(signr, &info, task);
+                                        }
+                                }
+
                                do_exit(exit_code);
to use some common routine instead of being duplicated for each
architecture. It should be easy enough to do all of this in a
	do_signal_exit(signr, &info, exit_code);
and not have the same logic duplicated N times.
