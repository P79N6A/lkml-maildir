Covered in "bad coding style" and "hard to read code", at least.

Wrong. The author has to work with the code, but there are much more people
that have to read it now and fix it in the future. It doesn't make sense
having everybody using their own indentation style, variable naming scheme,
and ways of defining constants. For better or worse, #define /is/ the
standard idiom (in kernel and elsewhere) to define constants in C. See also
<
http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/ten-commandments.html>,
 particularly
comandment 8. And consider also the /spirit/ of Documentation/CodingStyle.

I'd rather ask for the higher requirements of authors of new code... not
demand, just ask.
