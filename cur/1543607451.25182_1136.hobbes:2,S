/proc/meminfo did show the number of shared pages in the whole system
independent of SYSV shared mem.
In the -ac series it shows all shared anonymous pages
(i.e. tmpfs, shared mmap and SYSV shm pages)

linux:~ # ipcs -mu
------ Shared Memory Status --------
segments allocated 3
pages allocated 256
pages resident  12
pages swapped   87
Swap performance: 0 attempts     0 successes
It shows it.

That would only show the posix shared memory segments in this
instance.
