The short term fix is probably to just add a version number to
the zero page and make sure new changes only add stuff to the
end and the kernel has reasonable compat code for old versions.
Then LinuxBIOS would need to be changed to supply that version number.
Perhaps it could also include a checksum just to detect old BIOS
that don't supply a version number.
Long term I'm not sure. Adding LinuxBIOS specific tables also doesn't
sound very attractive.
