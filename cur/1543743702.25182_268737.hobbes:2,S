You need to make sure you or any of the later string match/extract 
functions are not reading outside of the skb, after the current data 
segment.
From what I could tell this was missing in your proposed change. If the 
helper sees a packet with a C as last byte it would read past the end of 
the skb, and without looking at the whole source I see it very likely 
there is operations on the data further down assuming a null terminated 
string..
