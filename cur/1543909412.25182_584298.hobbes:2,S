Not good enough, that only makes one thread wait.  Look here:
    
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/13/788
An unlimited number of threads can come in, each consuming resources of 
the virtual device, and violating the throttling rules.
The throttling of the virtual device must begin in generic_make_request 
and last to ->endio.  You release the throttle of the virtual device at 
the point you remap the bio to an underlying device, which you have 
convinced yourself is ok, but it is not.  You seem to miss the fact 
that whatever resources the virtual device has allocated are no longer 
protected by the throttle count *of the virtual device*, or you do not 
see why that is a bad thing.  It is a very bad thing, roughly like 
leaving some shared data outside a spin_lock/unlock.
