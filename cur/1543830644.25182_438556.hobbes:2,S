Eeek!  You mean the longhaul driver can change the frequency of the PCI
bus?  Oh, that's a recipe for disaster...

No, it's a hack :)
No, this is not acceptable.  What exactly do you want to do here?  Make
sure the PCI drivers are not doing DMA when the longhaul driver wants to
change the pci bus speed?
How often will this bus change happen?
Does it really save battery?
Will all PCI devices work properly at different speeds from what they
originally thought they were running at?
And what about PCI devices that always do DMA?  (think USB controllers,
they can easily saturate the PCI bus all the time).
Why not just suspend all PCI devices make the bus change, and then
resume them?  That would require no PCI core, or driver changes.
thanks,
