That attribute seems to violate the rule of "only one thing" and needs
to be parsed.  That does not seem like a good fit for configfs or sysfs.

Then it's not a perfect fit, sorry, as you are trying to get it to do
things it is not supposed to, or designed to, do.

That's one reason it is so easy to just write your own filesystem then.
What is it these days, less than 200 lines of code?  I bet you can even
condence more things to make it 100 lines if you really try.  That seems
much more sane than trying to bend configfs into something different.
Why are people so opposed to creating their own filesystems?
