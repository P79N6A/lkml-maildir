IIRC, this error is not what happen on the time [301.7320xx] during
boot, but happen before the boot.  Since the record says "Processor
context corrupt," MCE handler should call panic(or do something stop
the system) if the context actually corrupted during the boot.
In other words, it seems that 1) the error was recorded at last time
when your machine crashed unexpectedly(by cosmic-ray etc.) and not cleared
yet, or 2) your machine is doing something wrong in every reset/poweroff.
Could you try "mce=nobootlog" boot option?
Thanks,
