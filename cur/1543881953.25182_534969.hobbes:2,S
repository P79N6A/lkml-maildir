Fsck in chunkfs is still going to have an element that is proportional
to the file system size for certain cases.  However, that element will
be a great deal smaller than in a regular file system, except in the
most pathological cases.  If those pathological cases happen often,
then it's back to the drawing board.  My hunch is that they won't be
common.
