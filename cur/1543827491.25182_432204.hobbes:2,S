Since you haven't read my original reply to Matti, your comments aren't
appropriate for me since you don't know the full story.
However, I will point out that I'm at liberty to choose any option I
deem to be appropriate, for whatever reasons I feel appropriate.  In
this situation, I feel that withdrawing from providing mail forwarding
facilities is most appropriate.
I've been thinking about withdrawing that for some time for other
reasons - the SPF argument has provided another, and the final reason
to make it happen.
