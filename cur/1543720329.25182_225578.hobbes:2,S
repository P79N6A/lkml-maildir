I upgraded one of my boxes, and old Tyan Tiger 100 dual CPU box from
2.4.23 to 2.6.5, and for some reason, when I run lilo under 2.6.5, it
doesn't work right. WHen I reboot, all I get is LI
I have to boot to 2.4 to run lilo if I want to re-boot. The boot disk
is IDE, and there's some SCSI drives in the sytem as well. Anyone seen
anything like this before??
