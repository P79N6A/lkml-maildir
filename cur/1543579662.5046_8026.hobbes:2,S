Oopts I did this last week (fdisk /mbr doesnt do lilo any good :P)
Insert Debian boot cd, boot to install, press Alt f2  Create mountpoint,
Mount /dev/hda1, CD to that directory chroot to it, cd into /root and
./.profile (prolly not needed but can be useful sometimes)  run lilo. 
All fixed (except by the time i rebooted my motherboard had commited
suicide on me for being so stupid.  Im about to go collect the
replacement right now :)

If i boot my laptop to windows I have to do a total shutdown befire
booting back into windows or else gpm goes all crazy.  It occurs to me
that maybe OTHER things are going crazy too but are just not doing it as
loudly :)
I think it would be a good polacy to NOT boot from windows immediatly
into Linux without a shutdownn in between (a pain in the ass for sure :)
