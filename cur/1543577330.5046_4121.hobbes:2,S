The problem with this is that it means that page aging of
the mapped active pages is no longer balanced against the
aging of the unmapped active pages.
Though I guess this is not an issue in practice since the
downward aging for all active pages is done in
refill_inactive_scan() anyway and only the mapped pages
which aren't on any list have the potential to be balanced
badly.

Rik
