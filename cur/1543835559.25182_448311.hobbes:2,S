I believe we do know what the problem is: a) write_tsc() doesn't work, b)
the TSC's are unsynced (or have an offset), c) we removed a check which
would have caused pmtmr/rtc fallback.

yes.

There's no need for that, I think.  synchronize_tsc_bp() knows for-sure
that the synchronization failed, in a way which works on all CPUs.
So all we need to do is to set some flag in synchronize_tsc_bp() if `buggy'
is set, telling the clocksource code to give up on the TSC.

I was hoping the Intel guys could help out with that.
