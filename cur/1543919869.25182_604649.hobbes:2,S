$ cat m68k-export-asm-cachectl-h.diff 
Subject: m68k: Export cachectl.h
From: Matthew Wilcox <matthew@wil.cx>
libffi in GCC 4.2 needs cachectl.h to do its cache flushing.  But we
don't currently export it.  I believe this patch should do the trick.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
