How many is enough? I do not think we should reserve a particular number
of slots. Also, that only covers the first problem.
Let's imagine that it is 2003, Linux 3.0 is out, and everybody is using
capabilities. Someone decides to split CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH into less
powerful components CAP_DAC_SEARCH and CAP_DAC_READ.
Do you change the meaning of an existing bit, or do you end up with
all three capabilities? If you have all three, how do they interact?
If you change the meaning of an existing bit, stuff will break.
If there is a "known set" fK associated with the file, it is safe to
redefine the old bit. New kernels will know that the executable does
not define the new bit, so they can set it equal to the old bit.

One (or both) of us doesn't understand the other I think.
What I propose could work like this:
1. The kernel calculates the draft capabilities. (call them d_pP, etc.)
2. The kernel calculates old-style values too. (call them o_pP, etc.)
3. The kernel has /proc-configurable masks. (call them p_pP, etc.)
4. This is done:
pP = (o_pP & p_pP) | d_pP;
When the mask is 0, we get draft behavior. When it is full, capabilities
can be inherited in a more normal manner.
One might place these in p_pP:
CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH
CAP_KILL
CAP_NET_BROADCAST
CAP_IPC_LOCK
CAP_SYS_BOOT
CAP_SYS_NICE
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
These could be left out:
CAP_CHOWN
CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE
CAP_FOWNER
CAP_FSETID
CAP_SETGID
CAP_SETUID
CAP_SETPCAP
CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE
CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
CAP_NET_ADMIN
CAP_NET_RAW
CAP_IPC_OWNER
CAP_SYS_MODULE
CAP_SYS_RAWIO
CAP_SYS_CHROOT
CAP_SYS_PTRACE
CAP_SYS_PACCT
CAP_SYS_ADMIN
CAP_SYS_TIME
