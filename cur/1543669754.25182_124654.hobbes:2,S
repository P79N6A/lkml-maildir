I guess you don't see these without kernel preemption?
These are not errors, just warnings.  Most likely you only see them when
CONFIG_PREEMPT is enabled, because otherwise the kernel cannot detect
them.  But they still happen.
Does anything go wrong?  Or just these errors?
It looks like one of the scsi command functions grabs a lock and then
does wait_for_completion.  I have not identified what lock, yet.  But
its a bug in the SCSI code if so, and unrelated to preemption.
