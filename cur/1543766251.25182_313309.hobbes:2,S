Hi,
I have recently run into problems with 2.6 NFS clients accessing Irix 
servers. After extensive searching, I found the problem referred to on 
the kernel mailing list, in this thread:
http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/1/message/19372/thread
I could not find any other discussion of this issue and was wondering if 
there has been any further work done to write a patch for this issue? 
This bug definitely breaks 2.6 NFS clients, while 2.4 clients works fine.
Thanks,
-Eric
