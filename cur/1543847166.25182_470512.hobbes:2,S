The Dell Inspiron 9400 and Inspiron E1705 are pretty much the same 
laptop.  I'm glad to hear it's not just my keyboard or anything like that.
It sounds like there are several others who are experiencing the same or 
related issues.
Is there a way to change the interrupt trigger for the keyboard (the 
other devices seem to work just fine)?  Is there a way to force i8042 to 
XT-PIC on interrupt 1, to see whether it's related to the interrupt 
trigger, or something else that just looks similar?  Any other ideas for 
debugging or fixing?
I'd really love not to have to do the noapic or nolapic workaround...
