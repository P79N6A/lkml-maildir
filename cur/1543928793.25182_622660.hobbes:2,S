Does this oops occur under 2.6.24?  The SCSI async scanning code was
changed between 2.6.23 and 2.6.24, in a way intended to prevent exactly 
this sort of thing.

It has probably already been fixed.
Besides, it's not the flogging an unplugged device that causes the 
oops.  It's trying to unregister a device that was never registered in 
the first place.
