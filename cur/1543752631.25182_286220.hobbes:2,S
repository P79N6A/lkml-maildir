I know about that, but many people don't.

Less frustrating, yes, safer, not even slightly. You are still left on the
thin ice precisely the moment you are notified about the vulnerability (when
it goes public). Those not being members of vendor-sec still don't have the
privilege to know about the vulnerability ahead of time, before it goes
"officially" public. Besides, I know a few people who administer linux
machines who don't know what bkbits.net is, and they don't have to. There
should be a single place, a webpage which you can visit (or get an rss feed
of) and be sure you will be among the first to know about a vulnerability
(yes, I know about the CIA feeds, but this is still not the real thing,
IMHO).
