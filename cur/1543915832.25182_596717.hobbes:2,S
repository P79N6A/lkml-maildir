I still think this version is very wrong. It makes the ->signal->stats
absolutely meaningless. Quoting myself:

	No, no, this is wrong.
	tsk->signal->stats contains the accumulated info about the already exited
	threads, we shouldn't throw it out.
	Also, fill_tgid() doesn't make sense here, current is the last live sub-thread.
