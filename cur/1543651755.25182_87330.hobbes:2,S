    I see that the SARD changes have been merged, but MSEC() still has
    the overflow problem.  This takes care of it:
Thanks.  These patches left my control late in the game and have a couple
of other problems with them too. Watch for at least one more patch to
remove the old statistics counters as well. Inexplicably, we are now
counting statistics twice.
