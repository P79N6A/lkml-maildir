I've never seen that one before.  There's this comment in the source:
        update_stats(ioaddr, dev);
        /* HACK: Disable statistics as an interrupt source. */                                    /* This occurs when we have the wrong media type! */
        if (DoneDidThat == 0  &&
            inw(ioaddr + EL3_STATUS) & StatsFull) {
            printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: Updating statistics failed, disabling "
                   "stats as an interrupt source.\n", dev->name);
But it looks like you don't have the wrong media type?  Please check
this.
The 3c595 is ancient, and there are numerous reports of PCI bus
problems with it.  Fiddling with the PCI latency timers sometimes
helps.
My advice: buy another NIC.  Even a ten-dollar rtl8139 will
perform better than the 3c595.  Sorry.
