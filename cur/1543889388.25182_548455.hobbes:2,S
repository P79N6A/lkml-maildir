Subject: [PATCH 16/21] Unionfs: Disallow setting leftmost branch to readonly
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/23/447

From: Erez Zadok <ezk@cs.sunysb.edu>
Unionfs requires the leftmost branch to be writeable for copyup to work
properly and simply.  If, through branch-management commands (add, delete,
or mode change), the leftmost branch will becomes readonly, then return an
error (and tell the user to use "remount,ro" if they want a readonly union).
[jsipek: fixed up to apply cleanly]
