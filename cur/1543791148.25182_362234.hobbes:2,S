 I remeber similar problems with es1370 and OSS/ALSA driver. OSS were
fine, ALSA produced noise.
 It turned to be PCI latency timer issues. OSS driver changed it's value
to working good values. ALSA didn't touch latency timer, and during hard
disk activity sound stuttered.
 Got rid of problem by running setpci -d CARD:ID latency_timer=40
