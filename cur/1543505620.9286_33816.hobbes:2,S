Old X terminals maybe. But the XFree86 xc/nls/Compose/iso8859-1 file
contains only the following ways to produce a C with cedilla:
<Multi_key> <C> <comma>               : "\307"        Ccedilla
<Multi_key> <comma> <C>               : "\307"        Ccedilla
<dead_cedilla> <C>                    : "\307"        Ccedilla
Ctrl<T> <C> <comma>                   : "\307"        Ccedilla
Ctrl<T> <comma> <C>                   : "\307"        Ccedilla
Noone is using an apostrophe for a cedilla.

The file you should look at is defkeymap.map, not defkeymap.c. A cedilla
is typed as <Compose> <comma>. Therefore your patch is not necessary.
If you can't type the Compose key on your system (e.g. because you are
running SuSE Linux in France with a US keyboard, like I do :-)), you can
assign the Compose function to RightCtrl like this:
  $ (dumpkeys ; echo 'keycode 97 = Compose') | loadkeys
