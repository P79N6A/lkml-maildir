If anything, that will lead to readdir() flushing the heck out of dcache.
We had that system and we had dropped it.

If you are doing massive lookups after readdir you are very likely to do
it sequentially. Moreover, you will create additional pressure on dcache
and I suspect that it will cancel all benefits. Allocation and balancing
are not cheap. And if you have big directories (otherwise it simply
doesn't make sense) you'll have to think about hash pollution too (albeit
it's less serious, IMO). Try it - you will get seriously more complex code
and a hit on performance.
