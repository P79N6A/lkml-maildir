After several attempts of booting I got similar, but not the same message:
all things are similar like
last sysfs file: /block/hda/range
eip, and other registers, but
process not init:
Process htplug (pid: 942, ti=c7424000 task=c7420590 task.ti=c7424000)
Also, I should say that I can reproduce problem on real machine, and on qemu.
