Since this is one commit, could you also add the $PATCH number in the
ChangeSet,v log file? For merge operations you get the commit logs
from the merged tree but they wouldn't be mapped to the "1.x.patch"
logical change.
Should the BKrev value in ChangeSet,v have a correspondent on the
bkbits.net site? For example, for the ChangeSet,v RCS revision
1.26418, BKrev is 41fe523ecAJ3I6z55zHXaAI1vsDZ8Q. This changeset is
actually a bundled patch containing several patches but the bkbits
seems to show an empty patch:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/gnupatch@41fe523ecAJ3I6z55zHXaAI1vsDZ8Q
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@41fe523ecAJ3I6z55zHXaAI1vsDZ8Q?nav=index.html
On a side note, is the ChangeSet,v file updated before or after (or
in the same commit) the source files are checked in? It would be
better if it is updated after a commit since this way you can
guarantee that for a given revision of this file you have all the
"logical changes" checked in.
