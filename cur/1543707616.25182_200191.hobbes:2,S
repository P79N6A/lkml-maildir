OK, I think there _is_ a problem here.  I was suspecting my NFS setup 
maybe causing the NIC (eth0) to timeout and get reset, as I mount 
files from an old 486 -> 2.6.3 box.
But after messing about a bit, I checked the logs on my 2.4.24 box 
via SSH (AND eth1).  It hung as issued #> pico /var/log/messages  for 
about 3 seconds.. then came to life.  So...
... in the logs on 2.6.3 box straight after:
Feb 19 19:33:13 Linux233 kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit 
timed out
Feb 19 19:33:13 Linux233 kernel: eth1: link up, 10Mbps, half-duplex, 
lpa 0x0000
