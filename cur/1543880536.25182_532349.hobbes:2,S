what about create a module "user-gpio" for example that could request
some gpios that the board could have declared using resource
subsystem, like this:
static struct resource foo_gpio_resource[] = {
        [0] = {
                .start = 10,
                .end  = 11,
                .flags = IORESOURCE_GPIO,
        },
       [1] = {
                .start = 26,
                .end  = 31,
                .flags = IORESOURCE_GPIO,
        },
};
struct platform_device foo_device_usergpio = {
        .name           = "user-gpio",
        .id             = -1,
        .num_resources  = ARRAY_SIZE(foo_gpio_resource),
        .resource       = foo_gpio_resource,
};
This way "user-gpio" module knows which pins are avalaible to userspace.

This point is actully the one where I'm really not sure...
Enumerating user GPIOs would always start from 0 to GPIO_USER_NR - 1
and an application that need to be portable should use a config file
to specify which GPIO num to use...

Well an extreme solution would be to test in gpio_request(), if the
passed gpio nr is a user one then gpio_request() would return an
error. We could use is_user_gpio() function implemented by user-gpio
module
