If you even take 2 minutes to actually inspect the NVIDIA video driver sources 
(extract the .run file with --extract-only, and cd to usr/src/nv) you'll find 
the "glue" which is provided as source, but not under the GPL, does indeed 
#include kernel headers at compile time.
It does not distribute them, however, but it is completely nonsensical to 
class this as having "no dependency". It has a compile time and runtime 
dependency on the current kernel. What driver wouldn't?

There's clearly a grey area here, but I have no understanding of the law so I 
will not comment beyond stating fact. But you are at least wrong about the 
NVIDIA driver.
