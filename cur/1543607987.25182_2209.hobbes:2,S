Bryan,
I have an A7V-133 motherboard, and the VIA IDE just started to work finally,
after upgrading my BIOS to 1007, the latest one, which came out on the same
day as your 1009.  I never experienced "data corruption" as you described,
just irq timeouts which crashed fatally.  It seems like everything is normal
now, in other words, I could install Mandrake 8.1 with no problems whereas
it failed dozens of times before.  There was one other I did different this
time, and that was that I created the partitions in Partition Magic 7.0 for
Windows instead of using DiskDrake.  I can't see this would have any bearing
on things, so I can only attribute the recent successful install to ASUS's
new BIOS.
