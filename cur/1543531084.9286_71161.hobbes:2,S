   That respawner is just another program which has to stay around
regardless of OOM situations. The kernel doesn't know that this program is
supposed to respawn other daemons, and the kernel doesn't need to know it.
It just needs to let the program use the resources that have been
successfully allocated. That is necessary if you want a reliable system
where programs aren't killed unexpectedly.
