    I think that it wouldn't be that hard: some cases (like
CONFIG_EMBEDDED) are easy to spot, and the harder ones are going to bite
someone's arse sooner or later. If a bad dependency tracking doesn't
cause any harm, it doesn't need to be fixed right now, and if it bites,
it can be fixed before the next -stable release sees the light.
Fortunately, all dependencies (at least all that can cause harm if
untracked) will be spotted before the next minor kernel release.
    Hopefully...
