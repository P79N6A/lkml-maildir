Now I made all my partitions noatime, and wow,
sync; hdparm -C -Y /dev/hda; sync; hdparm -C /dev/hda
does not necessarily spin up the disk!
Someone suggested noflushd (does anybody have pointers?), because every write
would trigger spin up, but that is okay for me, I'd like to have a system where
no writes are done else when needed. About a minute (some more or less seconds)
after spindown, the disk spins up again, but now I cannot find out the cause.
I tried to strace the whole system with
strace `ps x|grep -v PID|grep -v $PPID|awk {' print "-" "p " $1 '}`
but this was not very clueful, because if some process writes, the buffers are
only changed in memory. Then the disk spins down (spindown time set to 20
seconds). After some time, the disk spins up again, because kupdate sends the
buffers to disk. Unfortunately, this way I cannot find (time-)relations between
writes or write-like functions (like munmap) and disk access.
Is there a simple switch or a patch out there which makes every buffer (head)
release synchronous (yet not discarding the buffer, it is still needed so all
daemons can fully run in RAM).
Xuân. :o)
