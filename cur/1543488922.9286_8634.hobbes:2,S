Yes, as I said the option now disabled.
About the BIOS support for the DMA/UDMA - this is that I found:
*there is a place to switch UDMA for the master/slave, but the switch
 is whether UDMA will be auto or disabled so of course it was and is auto.
*In the autodetecting the possible modes to set are LBA/NORMAL/LARGE.
 it was LBA, I tryed NORMAL -> destroyed the MBR and something more and
 then returned it to previous LBA.
Anyway on boot of the computer(not linux) there is this table and it shows me
that the disk mode is LBA,UDMA2.

the new hdparm is now attached.

what is host adapter? - isn't it on the motherboard?

info on the disk -> then hdparm has it,
otherwise info on what ?, or it doesn't relates to me.
Thanks,
