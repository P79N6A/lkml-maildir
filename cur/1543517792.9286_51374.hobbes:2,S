I don't want *anyone* writing to my inodes! But I do want them to be
able to hardlink to them.
And Andrea: why do you keep pointing me to "basic admin docs" or basic
Unix permissions info? Are you trying to be rude?

*I* haven't suggested removing anything. You're the one who is
suggesting that functionality be removed/restricted. I'm advocating
that things not be changed, since it works for co-operative
environments as well as very very hostile environments.
Again: if you're worried about hard links, lock up your directories.
That's all you need to do.

Where do you get this stuff from? Nowhere have I suggested that
permissions checking should be removed. There is no logical connection
between what I've been saying and what you say above.
I can't imagine where you get this chgrp "requirement" from. You seem
to be implying that I need to do that today to share data. Well, I
can't even remember the last time I (as a user) have called chgrp.

You've snipped the relevant context.
