My bad, that's the code I'm referring to:
121 static unsigned long getreg(struct task_struct *child,
122         unsigned long regno)
[...]
126         switch (regno >> 2) {
127                 case GS:
128                         retval = child->thread.gs;
129                         break;
What seem weird to me is that putreg(GS) will end up putting 'value' in:
child->thread.esp0 - sizeof(struct pt_regs) + (GS - 1)*4
whereas getreg(GS) will return the value of child->thread.gs
I must miss something, but the symetry seemed odd to me.

Frederik
