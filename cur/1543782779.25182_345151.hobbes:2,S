Subject: Why is kmem_bufctl_t different across platforms?

While exploring the asm-*/types.h files, I discovered that the
type "kmem_bufctl_t" is differently defined across each platform,
sometimes as a short, and sometimes as an int.  The only file
where it's used is mm/slab.c, and as far as I can tell, that file
doesn't care at all, aside from preferring it to be a small-sized
type.  I found this comment:

It appears to state that the max kmem_bufctl_t value is ~56 on most
setups, although it could be higher with 64-bit or bigger pages.
Since this value is never used by anything except that kernel-internal
file, should it be unified across all architectures?  If so, I'll send
a patch to remove the various typedefs and introduce a single
"typedef unsigned short kmem_bufctl_t" in include/linux/types.h
Cheers,
