  The suid root is well in place here.  What cripples is that the max
  size for the to phys locked memory segment which does not allow for
  more then 512 MByte.

  Implementing something like SIGDANGER (available under AIX 4.x for
  example) is much nicer.  I.e. reserve a signal for processes becoming
  a thread for the total available virtual memory pool.  This to suite
  any virtual memory exhaustion.
