Definitely not. It does not give unfair cpu towards interactive tasks. That's 
a very different argument.

Check the number of feedback reports. I don't feel petty enough to count them 
personally to give you an accuracte percentage.

Now you're really making a stretch of things. Where on earth did I say that 
interactive tasks don't have special requirements? It's a fundamental feature 
of this scheduler that I go to great pains to get them as low latency as 
possible and their fair share of cpu despite having a completely fair cpu 
distribution.
