One small thing that still bothers me about PCI is the duplication of
info in pci.h and devlist.h.
Would it be reasonable to build new file pci_ids.h with a build tool,
from data in devlist.h?  Or perhaps use a build tool to generate both
pci_ids.h and devlist.h from your pci.ids database (once it is in sync
with the kernel)?
