This has some importance to database users, as orderly shutdown of
userspace is required for data integrity there in a similar fashion as
it is for the kernel to undergo orderly shutdown so as not to corrupt
filesystems (in both cases, some pains are taken to recover from these
kinds of situations as best as possible, however, neither's recovery is
infallible). So OOM kills during client overloads are highly undesirable.
I'll take this as a more general directive to audit and clean up the
non-overcommit accounting, which I don't have an issue with taking on,
before moving on to refining the semantics.
I'll do this up as a series of small fixes and so on. mlock coverage is
a certainty given database usage patterns and my current position.
