Not in my situation. The separate disks perform about the same if I
shoot down rc5des. Have a look.
Btw. What kind of motherboard/cpu are you using? I'm running a Abit BH6
(BX chipset) with a Celeron 300A overclocked to 450 MHz. I used one of
these disks in a system with a K6-200 and a VIA chipset (TX clone) once,
but the disk would only do about 9.5 MB/sec. I didn't have VIA Apollo
support in the kernel though. Oh, and I'm running 2.2.6 on my box.
