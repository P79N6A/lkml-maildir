Silly accidents like that happen.  A lazy tarballer in action:
# ls -ld foo
drwxr-xr-x  2 root   root  48 Oct  6 17:34 foo
# cd foo
# tar cf ../foo.tar .
And too sleepy root who blindly untars to /tmp
# ls -ld tmp
drwxrwxrwt  2 root   root  48 Oct  6 17:34 tmp
# tar xf foo.tar
# ls -ld tmp
drwxr-xr-x  2 root   root     72 Oct  6 17:36 tmp
woops.
