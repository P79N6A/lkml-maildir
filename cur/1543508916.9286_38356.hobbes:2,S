Probably.  Check for overrun errors - in /proc/tty/driver/serial - they
show as oe:.  For example, I see
0: uart:16550A port:3F8 irq:4 baud:115200 tx:0 rx:61213 oe:5 
5 overrun errors.  Not surprising at 115200 baud on a K6-2 300???
Well, I had an incoming stream at 115200 and it could display
fine - until there was disk activity... when I would get the errors.
To drop characters on a 16550 even at 115200 baud requires interrupts
to be blocked for a long time.
I have tried the irqtune program which rearranges the IRQ priorities
and using it, I have received hundreds of MB of data with only
a few overrun errors.  However, I'm not sure of the safety of
this program.  It worked for me.
