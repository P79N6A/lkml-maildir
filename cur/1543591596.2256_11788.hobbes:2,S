Hello all,
I was investigating a problem we believed we had with our monitoring
software (from sysorb.com), where it failed to report the number of
free and allocated inodes.
However, looking into the problem I found that it's the kernel that's
returning bogus values.
What do you think of this ?
[root]# cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-nr 
157097	-180
The number of free inodes is negative !  I find it hard to believe that
that's correct.
Kernel:  2.4.4 on i686
All filesystems are ext2fs.
If you need more information, let me know.
