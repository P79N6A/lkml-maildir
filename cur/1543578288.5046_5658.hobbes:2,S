I'm using a USB keyboard (on x86/uhci) without too much trouble.
Occasionally I seem to miss a key release event, causing the thing to 
autorepeat until I hit the key and release it again.
Also, the behaviour on pressing multiple keys simultaneously seems to be 
strange - 'grep' tends to come out as 'grerp' and 'mount' as 'mouunt' if I 
type them fast enough. That may simply be the keyboard's fault though.
