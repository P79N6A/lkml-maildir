The particular people that I deal with care about constraining things
on a per-cpuset basis, so that is the information that I personally am
looking for.  But it is simple enough to map tasks to cpusets and vice-versa,
so this is not really a serious consideration.  I would generically be in
favor of the per-process stats (even though the application at hand is
actually interested in the cpuset aggregate stats), because we can always
produce an aggregate from the detailed, but not vice-versa.  And no doubt
some future as-yet-unimagined application will want per-process info.
