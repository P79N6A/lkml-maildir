First of all, I largely consider this a joke.  All real-life embedded
kernel builds take place on hosted platforms; anything else seems to be
done "just because it can be done", as a kind of show-off art project.
Cute, but hardly worth impeding the rest of the kernel community for.
We're not talking about general platform dependencies here, but build
dependencies for the kernel.  A platform that can build the kernel is
not a small platform.
Second of all, these patches are not fullworthy replacements.  The
original patch using bc had less dependencies, but bc failed on some
platforms, mysteriously.  The new patches have *more* environmental
dependencies than that ever did.
Third, if someone actually cares to do it right, I have a smallish
bignum library at 
http://git.zytor.com/?p=lib/pbn.git;a=summary
 that
might be a starting point.
