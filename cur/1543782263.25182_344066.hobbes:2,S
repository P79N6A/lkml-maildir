The USB and IEEE 1394 subsystems have kernel threads which manage node 
additions and removals (usb/storage/usb.c, ieee1394/nodemgr.c). The add 
and remove functions of their storage drivers are called from these 
threads' non-atomic context. However if you don't need an own thread for 
any further bus management purposes, a workqueue looks suitable for hot 
plugging and unplugging.
