The linux tree is certainly a derivative work of itself.  The more important 
(and much more difficult) question is whether the metadata about the tree is a 
derivative work under the rules of the GPL, or whether it is mere aggregation.
I think you could make a compelling argument that the linux kernel history 
metadata is *not* covered under the GPL, and hence can be restricted by licensing.
