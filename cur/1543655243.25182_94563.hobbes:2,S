Yeah, Randy said that about 30s before I got this. :)

Ok, I can see that. But, are there really many systems that do not come 
with lspci(8) pre-installed? I would expect that most distributions do; at 
least the one I use does..
But, look the usage model. Who queries PCI information from the system? I 
would argue a) developers, b) power users, and c) users hitting a bug. 
a) are going to use lspci, since it's much more powerful. b) may use 
either text format, but it's also likely they'll use a graphical tool. 
Looking at my gnome setup, I do not find anything that lists PCI devices 
(besides a file browser in sysfs :).  And, c) are most likely going to use 
lspci becaus a developer asks for it. I do not remember the last time I 
saw someone ask for the output of /proc/pci. :)

I totally agree with you. But, I don't think the answer is in 
consolidating files; I think it's in writing intelligent and efficient 
tools to grok that data.

IMO, yes, since those tools provide the summary, and exist almost purely 
in userspace. I forgot to mention in the orginal email that we could 
also drop the PCI names database, right? This would save a considerable 
amount in the kernel image alone..
