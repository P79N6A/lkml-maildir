2.6.0-test1 and test1-mm2 b44 ethernet modules fail to work with the following 
card:
Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4401 100Base-T (rev 1).
For those struggling with this, please download and patch jgarzik's latest 
netdrv patchkit available at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patchkits/2.6/
which fixed it for me and it works flawlessly now.
Thanks
Con
