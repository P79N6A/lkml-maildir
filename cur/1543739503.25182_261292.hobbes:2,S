You are wrong, David. The kernel *does* have the information. I haven't
seen anybody except you deny this.
What has been said, is that it is considered too expensive to do the check
at select() time, based on the information that *is* available.

Not after select() has stated that the packet is ready for
reading. That is correct. I would to the definition of select() that
was posted earlier in this thread. You've chosen to ignore this
definition, it seems.

Not future behaviour. POSIX, based on the definition of select() would seem
to suggest that, in a delayed-drop implementation such as Linux's, that
select() should feel free to drop the corrupt packet. recvmsg() just makes
the use of select() with blocking sockets unreasonable. Don't you see this?

Again - we're not talking about the future. Get off that. The packet
is already in the queue. Linux already has the information to know whether
the packet will be dropped or not.
If you want to say that select() on blocking sockets is invalid, please
say it. Don't recommend against it. Say - the use of select() on blocking
sockets is invalid under Linux. Put it in documentation that people will
read.
That's all we want.
Cheers,
