Anything in linux/* that is included by userspace should not
presume that stdint.h has already been included or include it on
its own, because the userspace program may have already made its
own definitions of uint32_t, or it may not want them defined at
all.

Exactly!  This is why I want to create kcore/* and kabi/* that
define the appropriate types, then both userspace and the kernel
could use whatever types fit their fancy, defined in terms of the
__kcore_ and __kabi_ types, which could be _depended_ on to exist
because they are guaranteed not to conflict with other namespaces

looked at
it in the right way, did not become still more complicated.
