Yep it was all unmounted. But I don't have a transcript of this session. 
I was directly logged in, sorry.

Remounting filesystem read-only
This is with 2.6.1-bk6 and no concurrent access. With 2.4.25-pre7-pac1 
this does not happen.
So I rechecked the filesystem (with 2.4), hoping it won't get corrupted 
  and I would be able to delete the files, but:
sfhq:~# fsck /dev/myraid/lvol1
fsck 1.35-WIP (07-Dec-2003)
e2fsck 1.35-WIP (07-Dec-2003)
/dev/myraid/lvol1 contains a file system with errors, check forced.

Do you need the complete output? Btw. I have the same error on another 
partition (also on raid5, dm).
