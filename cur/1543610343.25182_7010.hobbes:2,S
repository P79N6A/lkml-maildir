The x86-64 port uses SYSCALL/SYSRET as the native call method for 64bit
programs.
Before x86-64 it turned out that SYSCALL is not really usable because
of some builtin limitations (which are fixed in x86-64). This is only
a problem for the K6, K7 should have support for SYSENTER/SYSEXIT (the 
Intel equivalent), which seems to be better designed. There is a patch
to use SYSENTER/SYSEXIT.
