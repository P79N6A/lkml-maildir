Anton fixed the code recently, but forgot to fix the documentation.
There is no "ia32" thing, its i386. The other thing is named 'ia64' in arch/

 The intent of this file is to give a brief summary of hugetlbpage support in
 the Linux kernel.  This support is built on top of multiple page size support
-that is provided by most modern architectures.  For example, IA-32
-architecture supports 4K and 4M (2M in PAE mode) page sizes, IA-64
+that is provided by most modern architectures.  For example, i386
+architecture supports 4K and 4M (2M in PAE mode) page sizes, ia64
 architecture supports multiple page sizes 4K, 8K, 64K, 256K, 1M, 4M, 16M,
 256M and ppc64 supports 4K and 16M.  A TLB is a cache of virtual-to-physical
 translations.  Typically this is a very scarce resource on processor.
