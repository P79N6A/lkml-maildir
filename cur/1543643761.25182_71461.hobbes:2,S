Actually the correct fix seems to be already in Linus' tree:
ChangeSet@1.564, 2002-09-15 22:53:19-07:00, david@gibson.dropbear.id.au
   [PATCH] Remove CONFIG_SMP around wait_task_inactive()
So after all, my patch wasn't all that wrong, just a little ... ;).
As it seems also the ieee1394 patches went in and the USB storage 
compilation problem is also fixed.
Best regards,
Roberto Nibali, ratz
