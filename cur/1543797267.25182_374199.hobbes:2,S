The documentation aspect could solve this chicken and egg problem.
If the OEM has provided documentation and initail versions of the  
driver under GPL (and we assume that they intend to complete the driver)
then we can give them the logo before the driver is 100% perfect in  
order that they can print their product boxes etc.
However, an OEM with a certified device which has become broken over  
time (or they didn't bother to finalise the driver after they had  
been granted the logo) will not be able to get any further hardware  
certified. They will have to fix the existing stuff first.
