A backport is not that likely. The patch removes iget4 and as a result
breaks compatibility for binary-only kernel modules that use iget and/or
iget4. So, I don't believe this patch is appropriate for a stable series.
I'm going to fix the iget4 race in 2.4 by adding a per-superblock
semaphore around the call to iget4 in Coda. My guess is that NFS and
ReiserFS will have to do something similar. Filesystems that do not
use a special 'find_actor' (i.e. iget) don't have a problem in 2.4.
