The knee-jerk reaction here is 'memory problems', but maybe not. If you restart
make after a sig11 kernel compile problem, does it blow up again straight away
at the same place, or does it run on for a bit then blow up somewhere else?

Was the old disk in the same machine? (If so, I guess that eliminates the idea
of memory problems).
2.2.x allow you to specify if (U)DMA should be used in the kernel config; I
don't know off-hand how 2.0.x decides whether to enable DMA on boot up or not.
You're not forcing DMA on with hdparm, are you?

Well, I reckon if toggling DMA on using hdparm brings the problems straight
back, that's a pretty clear indicator. More important than getting your disk
exchanged though, is reporting the model type here (hdparm -i, hdparm -I) so
it can be added to the DMA black list if necessary.
Oh, what motherboard do you have? (VIA?)
