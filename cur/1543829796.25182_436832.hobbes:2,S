Subject: -git: Why is drivers/net/wan/hdlc_generic.c:hdlc_setup() exported?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/25/137

Commit 4a31e348e3ecaf54c50240109ac4574b180f8840 added an 
EXPORT_SYMBOL(hdlc_setup) with the justification
   hdlc_setup() is now EXPORTed as per David's request.
Is a usage of this export pending for the near future or could this 
export be reverted until a user is submitted for inclusion?
TIA
Adrian
