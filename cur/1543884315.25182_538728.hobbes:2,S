I couldn't make sense of that sentence.  Could you restate it?

While it is true that 'echo -n' works here, I think that this will
cause confusion and irritation to users.  We have gone out of our way
for years now to support newlines as optional trailing characters on
input to the various bitmask formats, and to provide the newline on
output, in order to provide a comfortable interface for use from shell
scripts and prompts.
I think it would be an annoying inconsistency to not do so here.
I'd vote for adding a couple of lines of code to handle this:
+	char *bp;
+	bp = buf;
+	while (isspace(*bp))
+		bp++;
+	if (!*bp) {
+		cpus_clear(trialcs.cpus_allowed);
+	} else {
