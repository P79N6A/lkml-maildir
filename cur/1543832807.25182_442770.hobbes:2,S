Subject: [PATCH] i386 kexec:  Allow the kexec on panic support to compile on voyager.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch removes the foolish assumption that SMP implied local
apics.  That assumption is not-true on the Voyager subarch.  This
makes that dependency explicit, and allows the code to build.
What gets disabled is just an optimization to get better crash
dumps so the support should work if there is a kernel that will
initialization on the voyager subarch under those harsh conditions.
Hopefully we can figure out how to initialize apics in init_IRQ
and remove the need to disable io_apics and this dependency.
