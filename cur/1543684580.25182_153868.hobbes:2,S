Well I see in Linus's current tree:
	ndev->regen_timer.function = ipv6_regen_rndid;
And ipv6_regen_rndid() ends up calling get_random_bytes() which calls
extract_entropy() which now does a bare spin_lock().
So I think if the timer is run while some process-context code on the same
CPU is running get_random_bytes() we deadlock don't we?
Probably, we should make get_random_bytes() callable from any context.
