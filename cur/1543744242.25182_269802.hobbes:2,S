and i say: good catch! that does it!
i did "bk undo -a1.2000.5.108" on a current tree, booting this still gives
an oops:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-2.6.9_a1.2000.5.108.txt
excluding this single ChangeSet with "bk undo -r1.2118" does work with
CONFIG_EDD=y:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-2.6.9_r1.2000.5.108.txt
(the filename here should really read "...r1.2118.txt" because that was
the number of the changeset representing the above [PATCH] *after* i did
"bk undo -a1.2000.5.108". right?)

understanding a lot less of all this than you guys i also wonder why only
this single driver broke. i've always loaded a couple of drivers here,
maybe i could play around a bit e.g. CONFIG_SND_ENS1371=y instead of =m or
see if other hw drivers break too.

do userspace tools matter here? there is "sysfsutils-1.1.0-1" and
"libsysfs1-1.1.0-1" (both debian/unstable) installed here, /sys is mounted:
   sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)

thanks so far to all involved here, i really enjoyed "working" with you.
first class support at no charge...it's just incredible.
you guys rock,
Christian.
