Looks good. You can go ahead and add it to your tree. 
I do have one question, though. Here:
> +static struct kobj_type ktype_smbios = {
> +	.sysfs_ops	= &smbios_attr_ops,
> +	.default_attrs	= def_attrs,
> +	/* statically allocated, no release method necessary */
> +};
I have no .release method because I have not kmalloc'ed any 
instances of this struct. Do I need to re-add a release
method here?
