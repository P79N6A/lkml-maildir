Ok, I see it now.
In it you did not mention if this change was already in Linus's tree,
and if so, what git id it was.  As you sent it primarily to lkml, I
assumed that it was not upstream at this time, hence I did not apply it.
As 2.6.24 is pretty much not being maintained anymore, I don't think
this is an issue anymore :)
