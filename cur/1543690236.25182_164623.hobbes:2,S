Very nice! (The test setup & web-page, not the fact that the boot
failed... ;-).
As for perfmon under Ski: the latest perfmon should have the necessary
code, but I don't remember whether it made it into test5 already (and
I don't have CONFIG_PERFMON enabled in my Ski setup).  If it's not
there already, it should be there tomorrow, as Linus pulled on the
ia64 repository a couple of hours ago.
