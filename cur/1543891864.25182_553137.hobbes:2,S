I'm behind a firewall that doesn't allow it.  Luckily, the
firewall has some holes to allow me ssh access to a few
external machines.  It looks like I can use a "git:" url on a
box outside the firewall, then clone that to inside Sony
with a "git+ssh:" url.
I'll do that, unless someone else has a better suggestion.
Pushes and pulls will be two steps each, but at least it works.
