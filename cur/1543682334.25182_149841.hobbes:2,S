Paul,
I recently ran across something similar after having received a warranty
replacement drive. Mine turned out to be some real funky geometry being
reported by the ide-disk layer. I came up with a fix, that worked for
me, not sure how universal it is. See the thread at:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105840994419059&w=2
My patch that is attached in the first message of the thread is not
recommended, but the final simple fix worked also in my case. Does Linux
perhaps see the other drive with strange geometry? You can check with
cat /proc/ide/hd?/geometry
In my case, the head count reported by Linux was 255, which was bogus
and caused the problem. Hope this helps,
-Walt
