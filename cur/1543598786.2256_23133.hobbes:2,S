Hi,

Do you mean I should use something LIKE the WAITQUEUE_DEBUG (eg.
implementing something like that in skbuff.c) or I should use
WAITQUEUE_DEBUG?
The code in wait.h mainly seems to consist of issuing BUG() calls, and
thats not quite what I want to ;) But how is it to use? I don't know much
about waitqueues in the Linux kernel, I mainly played with the network
stack...
Are there any examples how to use the WAITQUEUE_DEBUG?
CU,
Jens
