In the world I've been living in for the last few years, GCC people don't
seem to take that much care to avoid breaking the kernel, especially when
the kernel is being gratuitously broken. David's __builtin_ct_assertion()
stuff looks like a sane way of getting the desired behaviour without having
to sacrifice any chickens, and getting that merged into GCC so that we can 
start to use it seems like a good idea.

Heh. That's magic.
