Greetings;
I just booted to a 2.6.6-mm2 kernel, and discoverd I had no sound.  So 
I logged back out of x, and found I had no keyboard!  ssh'd in from 
the firewall and rebooted it.
Both sound, and the backswitch from x were working perfectly up to and 
including 2.6.6.
1400 mhz Athlon, half a gig of memory, FC1 all yum updates.
Ideas?

Cheers, Gene
