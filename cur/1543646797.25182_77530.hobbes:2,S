It does.
I will not apply a patch that removes bcopy() in the name of 
"cleanliness", if it then results in a number of modules just adding their 
own
	#define bcopy(a,b,c) memcpy(b,a,c)
because then the whole cleanup would be pointless - it would just make 
some modules even uglier than they were before.
So I'd much rather see the XFS etc code moved away from bcopy() first,
because that's the _real_ cleanup. The library code isn't all that ugly in
comparison.
