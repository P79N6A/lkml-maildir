   How does a device know the region is not in use, if the generic PCI
   code takes care of that?
If you care that much about I/O and MEM resource usage, you can indeed
get what you want.  Look at how check_region works now, the I/O port
top-level parent always exists, and represents the whole space.
When a check_region is done, it's carving out a "piece" of the I/O
port top-level parent space and marking that "piece" as in-use.
It makes a new resource to represent this, and hangs it as a child
of the root.
Actually, it hangs it as a child of the "least specific" parent, so
you could nest these things arbitrarily, so as to represent things
like:
MEM space				[0x00000000 --> 0xffffffff]
	my card				[0x00100000 --> 0x00200fff]
		sram buffer A		[0x00100000 --> 0x0017ffff]
		sram buffer B		[0x00180000 --> 0x001fffff]
		control registers	[0x00200000 --> 0x00200fff]
You get the idea.  In fact, I have just this situation on my
UltraSparc right here, the EBUS is what Sun uses as a bridge between
PCI and the "ISA like" devices (mostly a NatSemi chip with floppy
controller, serial ports, etc.) and that portion of /proc/ioports
looks for me like:
fffff9fff1000000-fffff9fff17fffff : EBUS
  fffff9fff1000000-fffff9fff1001fff : clock
  fffff9fff1200000-fffff9fff120003f : cs4231 regs
  fffff9fff13062f8-fffff9fff13062ff : su(mouse)
  fffff9fff13083f8-fffff9fff13083ff : su(kbd)
  fffff9fff1400000-fffff9fff140003f : serial(sab82532)
  fffff9fff1400040-fffff9fff140007f : serial(sab82532)
  fffff9fff1702000-fffff9fff170200b : 4231 playback DMA
  fffff9fff1704000-fffff9fff170400b : 4231 capture DMA
  fffff9fff1706000-fffff9fff170600b : floppy DMA
  fffff9fff1726000-fffff9fff1726003 : LED auxio
