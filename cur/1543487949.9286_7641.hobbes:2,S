Well, it can be used unconditionally as long as the file is MCA only...
(Such as ne2.c, 3c523.c, ibmmca.c, fd_mcs.c, etc.), however, it is clearly
another small bag for me to wear...
There are also some drivers that never mark the adapters as used, and some
that mark it used but not unused. They need to be fixed too...
The reason why they should be marked used/unused is for multi-detection to
work properly, and to make it possible to register the name of an adapter
without having a driver loaded for that adapter, etc.
