You can read the code, say in util-linux-2.10*.
This time-setting stuff is a bit of a mess - not all chips follow
the original mc146818rtc in all details.
The result is that, even though kernel (/dev/rtc) and "hwclock --directisa"
do more or less the same things, "hwclock --directisa" succeeds in some
cases, where the kernel fails (e.g., hangs). I think I do not know of cases
where the two possible approaches of hwclock, namely via /dev/rtc and via
direct port access, both fail.

But the timezone offset is already maintained in the kernel.
(The way it is done is broken, but that is a different matter.)
And hwclock tells the kernel about the present timezone.
