Agreed and I'm willing to run test-scripts on my system, that has these
hangs (long ones with 2.4.19-pre1 to 2.4.21-rc5 and only short ones with
2.4.21-rc6). But at the moment I have neither time nor enough knowledge to
write a test to reproduce it.
So if someone comes up with a suitable test skript, I'm happy to try it
and use it on different kernel versions.
Bye,
Matthias
