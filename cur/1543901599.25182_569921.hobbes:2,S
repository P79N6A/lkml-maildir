Subject: [PATCH 0/10] CPU hotplug error handling fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This series of patches fixes the error handling for cpu hotplug.
The problem is revealed by CPU hotplug/unplug test with fault-injection.
The patch 1-3 are sysfs or driver core related error handling fixes.
These are not directly related to cpu hotplug. But these are needed to
pass the stress test.
The patch 4 changes the behavior when one of the callbacks in notifier
chain returns NOTIFY_BAD with CPU_UP_PREPARE event. This change makes
cpu hotplug error handling simple.
The patch 5 simplifies the cpu hotplug event handling in topology.c
by the patch 4.
The patch 6-10 are error handling fixes in cpu hotplug event callbacks.
These fixes also depend on the change by the patch 4.
Here is the test script I have confirmed with these patches.
I guess we still have the similar bugs that I could not test due to no
hardware. So it may be worth someone trying this script.
