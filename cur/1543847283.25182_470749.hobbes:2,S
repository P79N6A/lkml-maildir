But in this case how can you ever solve the
problem of ld.so executing the binaries for which
the user does not have an exec permission?
Yes, the userspace apps usually should not enforce
the kernel's access control, but ld.so seems to be
the special case - it is a kernel helper after all,
so it have to be carefull and check what it does.
