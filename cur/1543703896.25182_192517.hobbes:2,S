2.4 is fine if you use the ataraid code. mirroring is not fault tolerant 
so you would not want to use that. raid-0 and jbod is ok. i am currently 
looking into 2.6. i will probably write an evms plugin for the new 
kernel. the nice thing is that it will work also for 2.4er kernels with 
the evms patches plus we get a proper mirroring solution for free. :)
