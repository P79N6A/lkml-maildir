Guys. This is Network section of my config:

# CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP is not set
# CONFIG_NETLINK is not set
# CONFIG_NETFILTER is not set
# CONFIG_FILTER is not set

CONFIG_INET=y
CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST=y
# CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER is not set

I work on this config (2.4.13) now and my machine has eepro100.o loaded.
Now I test it. This problem is appear when some options of IP section is
enabled. Now I can't say which of them. (I think SYN or MROUTE but it's
my assumption).
