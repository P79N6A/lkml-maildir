I think your got something  wrong, I've a 2 cpus box, all is ok,see below:
[root@info /proc]# cat interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:    1245694    1389471    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:        157        121    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:          0          1    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
 10:      10685      10958   IO-APIC-level  usb-uhci, e100
 14:      36926      50216    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 15:          1          1    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
NMI:          0          0
LOC:    2635076    2635074
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
Read the IRQ-affinity.txt which should usual be at
/usr/src/linux/Documentation, and change the configuration maybe your can
specify cpu1 processes the IRQ 18. And check the result.
