Yes I only have the first patch you sent on lkml on top of 2.6.24-rc4-mm1.
attached below. I didn't see the second one on lkml ?

my n/w environment seems to reproduce these issues quite easily. if you
need some testing, just ping me.

Subject: [PATCH] [TCP]: Fix fack_count miscountings (multiple places)
1) Fack_count is set incorrectly if the highest sent skb is
already sacked (the skb->prev won't return it because it's on
the other list already). These manifest as fackets_out counting
error later on, the second-order effects are very hard to track,
so it may fix all out-standing TCP bug reports.
2) Prev == NULL check was wrong way around
3) Last skb's fack count was incorrectly skipped while() {} loop
