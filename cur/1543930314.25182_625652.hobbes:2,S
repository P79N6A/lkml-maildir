i wanted to write a reply to suggest a checkpatch policy for this. When 
i noticed this sentence at the end of your mail:

/me too :-)
any policy that gets into checkpatch.pl's default output is a policy for 
arch/x86 patch merging. (as long as it's not a false positive) And 
because we do all these unifications the effects of checkpatch.pl 
permeate basically every aspect of arch/x86.
one approach would be to make new macros in include/* a no-no. That 
would hurt a few of the legitimate uses though, so maybe a useful 
refinement would be to check the structure of macros: are arguments used 
twice (side-effect), are arguments unused (typechecking dager), are 
arguments cast (type-loss danger), etc. Looks very hard to implement 
though :-/ Andy, what do you think?
