  I did a busy-loop microbenchmark, and I think it's informative enough. :-)
  The following command is run on three versions - vanilla version, one 
with read_down/up(->s_umount) added to vfs_write(), and one with 
brsem_read_down/up(->s_umount) added to vfs_write().
# time -p dd if=/dev/zero of=out bs=32 count=10M
  The test is run three times and the results are averaged.
a. vanilla
real 58.63
user 5.61
sys 52.37
b. rwsem
real 59.24
user 6.06
sys 52.29
c. brsem
real 61.74
user 5.78
sys 55.04
  I don't think brsem has any chance of being faster than rwsem if it's 
slower in this micro benchmark.  One weird thing is that the result of 
rwsem consistently showed higher user time and lower system time than 
vanilla (no synchronization) case, maybe oprofiling will tell something.
  Anyways, you were absolutely right.  My brsem was a pretty stupid idea 
after all.  Let's hope at least I learned something from it.  :-(
  Thanks a lot.
