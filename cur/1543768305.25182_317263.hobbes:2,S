Revert all spinlock_t types that kgdb uses to raw_spinlock_t to get the
actual spinlock code. A compile trick matches up the right functions
with the struct definition so that changes to the kernel code is minimized.
The spinlock_t defintion in the RT patch is #defined to be a blocking lock
which is not what kgdb wants in order to be happy.
Also, make the interrupt handler setup uses SA_NODELAY or something like
that from my memory. The rest is relatively trivial.
Thanks for making the attempt. Somebody needed to do this a long time
ago. :)
