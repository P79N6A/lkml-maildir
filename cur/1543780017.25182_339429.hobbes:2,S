I tried to compile the patch on top of 2.6.13-rc4-mm1, it applied with a few 
offsets, but it looked ok.
Here is the error I get when I compiled it:
  CC      arch/x86_64/kernel/traps.o
arch/x86_64/kernel/traps.c: In function `show_trace':
arch/x86_64/kernel/traps.c:228: warning: implicit declaration of function 
`print_traces'
arch/x86_64/kernel/traps.c:228: error: `task' undeclared (first use in this 
function)
arch/x86_64/kernel/traps.c:228: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported 
only once
arch/x86_64/kernel/traps.c:228: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [arch/x86_64/kernel/traps.o] Error 1
I took a look at the traps.c file, but couldn't find any solution, as there is 
no print_traces function and task variable too in this section.
