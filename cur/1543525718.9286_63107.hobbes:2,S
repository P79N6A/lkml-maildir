Markup. At one point, just before the introduction of DMA IDE chipsets,
the price differential was closing in on $30 or so - the ratio of people
buying new SCSI drives to IDE was climbing rapidly and for a brief while
it looked like the PC industry might actually end up going the SCSI route. 
Now UDMA 66 drives have more than enough performance for just about
anything you'd want to do on a typical PC and SCSI is relegated to the
price inelastic server domain. The only thing that will change that
dynamic in favor of SCSI or other new technology is changing peoples'
expectations of what you can do with a desktop machine. That could mean
everyone running Unix-like systems and wanting good I/O or it could mean
things like hotplugging. I suspect that IDE will be marginally extended to
make that happen rather than everyone jumping over to a completely
different interface though.
