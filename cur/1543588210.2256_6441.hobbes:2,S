This must be a Dell issue then, because I wrote a lm_sensors (
http://www.netroedge.com/~lm78/
) driver for the
ServerWorks OSB4 (SouthBridge) some time ago and they have merged it with the PIIX4 driver. lm_sensors 2.5.5 and above
should have support for the ServerWorks System Management Bus. I have been running lm_sensors 2.5.5 on several mobos
with ServerWorks chipset of all kinds (LE, HE, HE-SL) and most of them work with the PIIX4 driver (with OSB4 support).
The only one I've had problems with so far, is the Compaq DL360 which seem to have disabled the SMB on the OSB4 and
instead using another approach (proprietary). This could be the problem with the Dell machines too (2450, 2550, 1550).
Best regards
