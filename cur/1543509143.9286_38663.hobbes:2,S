hi all,
i know this question is too elementary for the list, but i am posting it here
hoping to get some doubts clarified.
can anyone elaborately tell the differences b/w
1. 32-bit OS vs. 64-bit OS
2. 32-bit Kernel vs. 64-bit kernel
is it necessary to have 64-bit I/O, 64-bit addressing etc. (i.e. all the 64-bit
things to be there for an OS to be called 64-bit?).
these are quite confusing terms, hoping that experts can help me out here.
regards
-sandeep-
