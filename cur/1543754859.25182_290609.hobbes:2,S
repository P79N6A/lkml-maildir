Subject: Correct way to release get_user_pages()?

Reading through the tree, I see that some callers of get_user_pages()
release the pages that they got via put_page(), and some callers use
page_cache_release().  Of course <linux/pagemap.h> has
	#define page_cache_release(page)      put_page(page)
so this is really not much of a difference, but I'd like to know which
is considered better style.  Any opinions?
Thanks,
  Roland
