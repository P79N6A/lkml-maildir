Is there something lighter weight than this? This is called during the 
function tracer and that is called at ever function. I would also rather 
this be an inline function defined in asm/ftrace.h if possible.

Actually, didn't you say current is not available either? We are testing 
current first.
I still wonder if there's a better way to find out if it is safe to run.
Perhaps the arch code can test the %gs register to see if it is actually 
something valid?
