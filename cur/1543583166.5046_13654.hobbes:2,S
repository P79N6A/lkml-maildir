Wait! 57 and 77 are not in use, but 65 and 77 are?
(Is the second 77 a typo for 66 or 67?)
A lot of partition IDs are attributed to Novell.
64 (Netware 286) and 65 (Netware 386) are well established, and
you tell me 66 is Netware SMS, 67 is Wolf Mountain and 69 is Netware NSS.
But also 51 and 68 occur in reports. Do you know anything about those?
