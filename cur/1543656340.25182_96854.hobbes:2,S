	With all due respect, your fix is quite ugly.
	And think about it this way : your new param architecture is
supposed to be flexible and supposed to allow modules to get
parameters in any shape or form. But, on the other hand, it's
impossible to implement something as simple as 'c' without ugly hacks.
	Maybe we can deduct from this that the new param API is not
flexible enough and that the simple addition of an opaque type (priv)
can have some value. From personal experience, most APIs that didn't
had mechanism to pass private data between an entity and the entity
handlers ended up regretting it and having to add it back at some
point.
	Have fun...
