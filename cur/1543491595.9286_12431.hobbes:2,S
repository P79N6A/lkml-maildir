In my 2.2.4 kernel device aliases don't show up in /proc/net/dev (which
implies they don't show up in ifconfig when started w/o parameters).
They are operational however, even ifconfig eth0:0 shows relevant
information.
In 2.0 kernels device aliases do show up in /proc/net/dev
Which kernel is "right"?
