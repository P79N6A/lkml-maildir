What about:
<*> serial i/o (mouse, keyboard...) support"
  <*> PC PS/2 and keyboard controller (i8042)
    <*> PS/2 mouse support
    <*> Typical (AT) keyboard support 
  <*> Serial port (COM) <something> support
    <*> Serial port (COM) mouse support
  [*] Advanced keyboard support
    <*> Other keyboards here
  <*> [the other Things]
Yes, it confuses people who only wants a mouse working. 
Still i think it's better than selecting the driver controller
and after that selecting the device controller (if i'm understanding
the current menu ;) BTW, we'll never be able to put a <*> Mouse support
so i think that this is the best way. 
Also, the current menu has some things that i dislike ;)
- Please, don't use names such "i8042 ". Most of the people
  (even people in this list i guess) didn't know what
  a i8042 controller is until they had to configure that ;)
  "Help" is the right place for explainig that i guess ;)
- Replace "mice" by "mouse support" or something. English isn't the only 
  language in the earth. Many people think that the plural
  of "mouse" is "mouses" ;)
- In the current menu, you can disable the i8042 thing and you still can see
 the [*] Keyboard entry alone.
and another (crap) suggestion could be to put the pc speaker support under a /proc/something
and remove the menu entry ;)
