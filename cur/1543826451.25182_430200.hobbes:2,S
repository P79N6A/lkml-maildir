That's a bug in sound/pci/cs4281.c.
There's a debug patch in -mm
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.17-rc5/2.6.17-rc5-mm3/broken-out/debug-shared-irqs.patch
which trips up drivers which request an IRQ before their IRQ handler is
ready to accept IRQs (they'll crash in real life if the IRQ is shared).

So does that.

Try reverting debug-shared-irqs.patch, or disable the sound driver?
