This might work.
I've no earthly idea yet how it might work.  But I take you at your word
that there's potential here worth pursuing.
I've gotten behind on my email the last three days - sleeping off a
cold.  Do you have any suggestions for readings, or further explanations
you can provide, that might help me better understand how you intend to
accomplish this minor miracle?  Perhaps there is something in one of the
messages that I haven't digested yet.  I see your work-in-progress patch
of Wed, 06 Oct 2004 17:51:07 is one of the messages still in my input
queue.
