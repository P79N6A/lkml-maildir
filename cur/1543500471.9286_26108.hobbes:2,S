	And? Is it a mountpoint with different block sizes on mounted and
underlying filesystems? Or you had a bunch of files there at some moment?
Directories do not shrink. Any sort of shuffling the stuff towards the
beginning and truncating the tail *begs* for trouble. Syscall should not
touch too many metadata blocks - the more you are touching the bigger odds
to screw up on a dirty reboot you get. There is a very good reason why
entries do not cross the block boundary - we don't have to worry about
ordering of writes that way (well, we have, but not as hard as in case
of VFAT which *has* such entires).
	Trimming the slack on the fly is royal PITA. Doing it upon request
is trivial - cp -rl foo foo.old; rm -rf foo; mv foo.old foo; (or doing the
same by hands).
