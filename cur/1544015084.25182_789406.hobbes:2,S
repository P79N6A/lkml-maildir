What happens when you say -fno-inline-functions-called-once? Does it
disable inlining for those functions IN GENERAL, or just for the LARGE
ones? See?"
-fno-inline-functions-called-once disables the heuristic that always inlines
(static!) functions that are called once.  Other heuristics still
apply, like inlining
the static function if it is small.  Everything else would be totally
stupid - which
seems to be the "default mode" you think GCC developers are in.
