Unfortunately I can't really do to much messing around with this
machine right now, it's being used pretty heavily.  Even after bdflush
died and I needed to bounce the machine, I just about had to beat the
developers off the machine with a stick. :-)
Eric Sandeen suggested turning off DMAPI support, so I'm going to give
that a try first.  I'll go ahead and grab a copy of your patch, and
give it a try if the problem still resurfaces.
