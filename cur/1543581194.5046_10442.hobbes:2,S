Think about a given number of pages which are physically contiguous on
disk -- you dont need to cache the block number for each page, you just
need to cache the physical block number of the first page of the
"cluster".
SGI's pagebuf do that, and it would be great if we had something similar
in 2.5. 
It allows us to have fast IO clustering.

Usually we need to cache only block information (for clustering), and not
all the other stuff which buffer_head holds.
