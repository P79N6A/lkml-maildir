AIM7 results might be interesting, especially when run to crossover.
OTOH, AIM7 can make the current VM explode spectacularly :)
I saw it swap out 1.4GB of memory in one run, on my 2GB memory test
system.  That's right, it swapped out almost 75% of memory.
Presumably all the AIM7 processes got stuck in the pageout code
simultaneously and all decided they needed to swap some pages out.
However, the shell got stuck too so I could not get sysrq output
on time.
I am trying out a little VM patch to fix that now, carefully watching
vmstat output.  Should be fun...
