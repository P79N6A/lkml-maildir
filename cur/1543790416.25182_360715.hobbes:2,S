I think this always shows this amount of RAM. Windows does the same thing
AFAIK. It's basically some sort of limitation and the motherboard reports an
specific amount of memory.
There is a deeper reason, ask google.
(IA32 does not support all that much RAM, so it shows like 3.xxGB RAM but uses
the rest for System Resources like Video, PCI, bla bla)
EM64T is not really 64Bit so, is still IA32.
