Hi,
If I'm correct, this patch won't make to 2.6.22, and the first possible 
inclusion would be 2.6.23?
Could you summarize what other regressions were reported? I can't find 
much information about sata_mv regressiobs on linux-ide list (at least 
when looking at the subjects: lots of patches from you, and two reports 
from me).
