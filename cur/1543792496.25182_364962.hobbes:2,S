Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Sam, do you like the syntax? I hope properly indented rendering will
appear soon.
------------------------------------
[PATCH 5/6] kernel-doc: nested structs and unions support
Now something like this
	struct a {
		struct b_s {
			union {
				int c;
				int g;
			} u;
		} b;
		struct d_s {
			int e;
		} d;
	};
is possible to document with the following kernel-doc comment:
	/**
	 * struct a - ...
	 *
	 * @b: ...
	 * @b.u: ...
	 * @b.u.c: ...
	 * @b.u.g: ...
	 * @d: ...
	 * @d.e: ...
	 */
