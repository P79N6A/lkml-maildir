Christoph, can you comment on what Steve said to my patch which is exactly
the same as yours acl-endianess-annotations.patch?
============================================================================
From: Steven French <sfrench@us.ibm.com>
You may be correct, but making the in memory representations of these
structions little endian seems wrong and I would be surprised if it were
little endian, but I have not had time to think through what happens when a
local filesystem takes an existing hard drive with ACLs on various inodes
and moves the drive from a little endian to a big endian machine and the
endian implications on this structure.
Although the representation on the wire for the cifs protocol is clearly
little endian for the acl entries, I am uncomfortable with changes to the
in memory representation until I do more checking.
