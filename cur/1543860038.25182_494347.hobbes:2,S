Yes, 64-bit kernel was used.

Volanomark and Re-Aim7 ran close to 0% idle time for 2.6.19 kernel.
Idle time
increase significantly for Volanomark (to 60% idle) and Re-Aim7 (to 20%
idle) 
with the rt kernel.  For netperf, the system was 60% idle for 
both 2.6.19 and rt kernel and changes in idle time was not significant.

Turning off PREEMPT_RT for 2.6.20-rc2-rt0 kernel
restored most the performance of Volanaomark
and Re-Aim7.  Idle time is close to 0%.  So the benchmarks
with large number of threads are affected more by PREEMPT_RT.
For netperf TCP streaming, the performance improved from 40% down to 20%
down from 2.6.20-rc2 kernel.  There is only a server and a client
process
for netperf.  The underlying reason for the change in performance
is probably different.

Thanks for the pointer.  Will let you know of any relevant traces.
Thanks.
