The specific card in question is a 3com 3c905c-tx-m, but the
motherboard (a Soyo KT400 Dragon Ultra) also has a via-rhine on-board
interface that behaves the same way.  I can reproduce this on 2.4.18,
2.4.19, 2.4.20-rc1, 2.5.44, 2.5.45, and 2.5.46, with the following
exception: if ACPI is turned on in the 2.5.x kernels (completely on --
if CPU enumeration only is used, the behaviour is the same as if ACPI
is turned off), the network starts working fine again, but USB (using
uhci-hcd) stops working (rather completely -- I have a USB hub that
has an LED to show whether or not it is powered, and it actually shuts
off if ACPI is turned on).  The various sub-options of ACPI seem to
have no effect.  It does not matter whether the driver is compiled as
a module, or compiled into the kernel.
The following is left in the logs, repeating once per minute or so:
