There are PCI cards for each of Rhine-I, -II, and -III.

What exactly does on-motherboard mean in this context? Separate chip
soldered to the motherboard? Or integrated into the south bridge? Or both?

VIA uses the PCI revision number to identify their chips. In fact, I have
some patch lying around that identifies the model of every Rhine ever
produced (at the time, anyway): VT86C100A, VT6102, VT8231, VT8233, VT8235,
VT8237, VT6105, VT6105L, VT6107, and VT6105M. I am not sure whether this
can be used to identify the models with this particular quirk, though.

Correct. But 0x3065 is fairly meaningless in VIA world.
