When the bits don't match, mine reduces to a mask-and-shift.  The
original reduces to a mask-and-conditional, which is usually slower.
Hopefully GCC optimises the latter to the former these days, but there
is no harm in helping.
I vaguely recall GCC being able to optimise (x&mask1) | (x&mask2) to
x&(mask1|mask2), not 100% sure though.  If so, the PROT_ bits
translation will reduce to prot & 7.
