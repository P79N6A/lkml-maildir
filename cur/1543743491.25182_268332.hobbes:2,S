Subject: QM_MODULES not implemented in 2.6.9

I noticed that this issue was there before but thought it was being taken care of since my Linux-2.6.2 kernel did not complain. Now I loaded Linux-2.6.9 and this QM_MODULES Function not implemented error pops up whenever I run module related command.
If I need update module patch, could someone tell which module patch I should apply? If something else is wrong, please advice. The kernel is configured to support module.
Thanks!
Eddie
