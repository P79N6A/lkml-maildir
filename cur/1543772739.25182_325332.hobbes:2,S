It's better to use different terminology. The notion of real time
is *not* a single dimensional vector that is either "more" or "less"
than of any particular thing. It's much more complicated than that.
There's at least more than one definition of hard real time floating
around with various degrees of determinism. Deterministic is
deterministic and many RTOS are capable of that. Theoretically provable
anything is pushing it and is not RTOSes are typically constructed.
I recommend dropping that ridiculous terminology because how complex
this problem/domain is as well as how misleading it can be.
