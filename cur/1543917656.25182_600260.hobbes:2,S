I wonder how that got there.
Printing something like
	bytes remaining: 0x12 (18)
is a quite logical thing to do, although pretty darm pointless.
otoh, looking at the various instances, we have lots of stuff like this:
  printk(KERN_ERR "seq-oss: unable to delete queue %d (%d)\n", queue, rc);
which I would argue is wrong and is inconsistent with most other error
reporting.  It should be
	unable to delete queue %d: %d
And this:
	printk(KERN_ERR "%s:  context size (%u) exceeds payload "
doesn't need the parens
Here:
	printk("hardirqs last  enabled at (%u): ", curr->hardirq_enable_event);
	print_ip_sym(curr->hardirq_enable_ip);
	printk("hardirqs last disabled at (%u): ", curr->hardirq_disable_event);
	print_ip_sym(curr->hardirq_disable_ip);
	printk("softirqs last  enabled at (%u): ", curr->softirq_enable_event);
	print_ip_sym(curr->softirq_enable_ip);
	printk("softirqs last disabled at (%u): ", curr->softirq_disable_event);
	print_ip_sym(curr->softirq_disable_ip);
all the parens are just illogical and should be removed.
Here:
		xlog_warn("XFS: %s: unrecognised log version (%d).",
			__FUNCTION__, INT_GET(rhead->h_version, ARCH_CONVERT));
should use "unrecognised log version: %d"
This:
		printk(KERN_ERR "udf: unknown compression code (%d) stri=%s\n",
		       cmp_id, ocu_i->u_name);
should use colon as well.
So in fact a large number of the instances I see in there are illogical and
basically gramatically wrong and should be converted to use a colon.
