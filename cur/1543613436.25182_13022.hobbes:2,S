Subject: Problems downgrading from Kernel 2.4.8 to 2.2.20

I am trying to downgrade, to see if an issue with the 2.4.x series
kernel is also present in the 2.2.x series. I have successfully
downloaded, compiled and installed a 2.2.20 kernel and added the
necessary lines to lilo in order to have it as an option and to boot
into the same root partition as the 2.4.8 uses.
I am getting an error when I boot up 2.2.20. Right after the partition
check it says this:
Invalid session number or type of track
hda: lost interrupt
and keeps repeating hda: lost interrupt once every ten seconds or so
until I reboot. 2.4.8 boots up just fine. I've done a search of the
unofficial archives and only found solutions to problems regarding CD
images and such.
Does anyone know what the problem is, and can anyone give me some help?
Is it even possible to downgrade like this?
Thanks.
