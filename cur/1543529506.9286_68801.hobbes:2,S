Subject: [PATCH] Ensoniq SoundScape with 2.3.51 (mpu401 changes broke it)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
Your patch to clean up the OSS stuff has broken the Ensoniq SoundScape.
Reverting one small portion fixes it.
Can you decide whether you want to wrap this in some magical #ifdef's
and send it on to Linus?
BTW, the documentation in Documentation/README.OSS suggests that this
card cannot be used with isapnp?
This is not my experience.
See 
http://www.huggie.dial.pipex.com/linux/sound.shtml
 for how it Works
For Me(TM).
Also since I applied my patch, I get this when I modprobe -r:
[root@byers /usr/src/linux/drivers/sound]# modprobe -r sscape
Trying to free nonexistent resource <0000-0001>
Sound device 2 went missing!
kmem_free: Either bad obj addr or double free (objp=c61bd000,
name=size-4096)
I imagine this is because of the changes too?
Simon.
