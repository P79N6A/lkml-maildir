I havn't followed this thread but I have a machine with an Asus A7V
motherboard with KT133 chipset and we had massive corruption before
christmas, both ide and network had corrupted packets. and now after
christmas we ran memtest86 on it and a 256MB module was very very broken.
and we got alot of Oopses and all kinds of strange stuff happened.
We've replaved that memory module now and now it's better but I have to
say that the KT133 or atleast the Asus A7V motherboard seems to be quite
broken. we have a lot of spurious irq's and the ide controllers freak when
but under some load and start getting irq timeouts and resets the ide
channels over and over again with some delay in between when it kind of
works, slow as hell but works.
We are going to replace the motherboard with one with VIA KT266A chipset,
hope that works better.

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
