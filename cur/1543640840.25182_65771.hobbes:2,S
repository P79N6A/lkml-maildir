Assuming that you have firmware.  What about the case of PCMCIA drives
that you plug in after the kernel has booted and get registered with
IDE almost immediately?

Erm, no.  Read the spec.  When the drive is spinning up from power on,
BSY is set.  BSY may be set for up to 30 seconds or so until the platters
are at full speed.  (Some drives take even longer, maybe 40 seconds.)
Once this is so, there are magic bytes you can read from the drive
register that tell you if the device is AT or ATA.  These aren't valid
until that BSY bit has cleared.
