Yes, there is some rework we can do here....

All of these are somewhat less important, because most users call the 
kallsyms generic functions which will in turn call these functions if 
the symbol isn't global.
So, they should suffer basically the same transformations as the 
kallsyms_ counterparts and can be considered almost "internal" to the 
kallsyms infrastructure.

This one look fine, as there is no duplication in any other function.

These 4 functions can probably be condensed into just one, by allowing 
NULL pointer arguments to mean "don't need this result":
kallsyms_lookup_size_offset(a,s,o) <=> kallsyms_lookup(a,s,o,NULL,NULL)
lookup_symbol_attrs(a,s,o,m,n) <=> kallsyms_lookup(a,s,o,m,n)
lookup_symbol_name(a,n) <=> kallsyms_lookup(a,NULL,NULL,NULL,n)

These 2 are probably fine.
There is a difference in the way the module name is passed, because 
kallsyms_lookup assumes it can return just a pointer to the module name.
However, we should probably change that interface so that the caller 
provides the buffer to hold the module name, to avoid races. The 
stop_machine should help already, but returning a pointer that can be 
stale just a little bit later isn't pretty anyway.
I can do a patch for this, but this will touch a few subsystems that use 
these interfaces (there are not a lot of them, though). The major change 
would probably be the allocation of a small buffer (56~60 bytes) in some 
of the callers to hold the module name.
