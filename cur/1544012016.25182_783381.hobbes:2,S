Well, more interesting is what's /not/ yet in linux1394-2.6.git but will
hopefully be ready for the post-2.6.28 merge window, and that's the
following changes to the <linux/firewire-cdev.h> ABI:
  - Add ioctls for isochronous resource management,
  - add ioctl for broadcast write requests,
  - add ioctl for iso context removal, allow more than one iso context
    per fd.  (This is the least important feature though.)
Jay Fenlason has had implementations of all of these for a while now, I
just need to bring them up-to-date with the latest fw-cdev changes,
notably the client resource idr change.
So, I hope to have some substantial additions ready soon, on top of what
/is/ in linux1394-2.6.git at the moment:
David Moore (1):
      firewire: Include iso timestamp in headers when header_size > 4
Frans Pop (1):
      ieee1394: ohci1394: don't leave interrupts enabled during suspend/resume

      ieee1394: consolidate uses of IEEE1934_BUSID_MAGIC

      firewire: add a client_list_lock
      firewire: typo in comment
      firewire: improve refcounting of fw_card

      ieee1394: ohci1394: flush MMIO writes before delay in initialization
      firewire: fix resetting of bus manager retry counter
      firewire: reorder struct fw_card for better cache efficiency

Some further notes:
  - We still need to increment the ABI version number due to David's
    patch, and document the change appropriately.
  - There is still an old fw-topology patch in #master which is not yet
    merge-ready, my "insist on successive self ID complete events".
  - I really should stop messing around with drivers/ieee1394 and
    instead concentrate on drivers/firewire now.
But wait, there is one other thing sitting in linux1394-2.6.git:  The
firedtv driver which went from Greg's staging tree to linux1394-2.6.git
before it was decided to put several staging drivers into 2.6.28
mainline --- and so it happened that firedtv is still out of the
mainline.  I still want to do some mostly trivial updates to it before I
post a snapshot on LKML for review.  I hope to get this done during the
coming merge window, or slightly thereafter, and to get it finally into
mainline for 2.6.29.
There is one todo-item of this driver which is not trivial, and that's
its adaptation from drivers/ieee1394 to drivers/firewire.  But this
should not block its mainline submission.
