	I don't think it's a good idea either, and I'm sorry this turned into an 
argument over the merits of RFC2385. I don't like it, and that's one of the 
reasons I didn't suggest a thorough implementation. I just want enough to 
solve the particular problem that I have, which is that Zebra on Linux can't 
interoperate with Cisco BGP implementations using MD5 authentication.
	There is some merit to the argument that one shouldn't crap up a network 
stack just because someone else did. The question is, is interoperability 
worth this small piece of crap. I personally think it is, but I'm prejudiced 
since I happen to need it.
	I'm trying to decide if I need it badly enough to make it worth the effort 
it would take to implement it. One factor that would go into that decision is 
whether the patch would have a chance at being accepted into the kernel or 
whether at least kernel hooks to allow it to be implemented as a module might 
be accepted.
