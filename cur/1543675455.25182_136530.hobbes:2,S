Yes, that 64KB should be increased. The sg driver
allows up to 255 * 32 KB (just less than 8MB). From
memory cdparanoia uses a 128 KB packet size.
cdrecord uses 63 KB so it gets through.

That is unhelpful. Is there a good reason for that?
I plan to get working on the SG_IO ioctl in the block
layer shortly. Andy has a patch to address the units
of the command timeout. sg's iovec may map simply as
well (maybe it won't either).
