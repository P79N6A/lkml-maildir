Lately I've been seeing my kernel logs spammed by these events:

This is with the various 2.6.16-rc*-git* kernels, and possibly older 2.6.15 series as well.
They always seem to arrive in large bursts, like the bunch shown above.  Using wifi
over ipw2200 to a WPA2 AP.
Either this is "normal" behaviour, in which case the code should NOT be spamming me,
or something is broken, in which case.. what?
Cheers
