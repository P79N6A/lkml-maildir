Agreed, this certainly isn't a huge page bug.
But, I do think it is absolutely insane to have pmd_clear_bad() going
after perfectly good hugetlb pmds.  The way it is set up now, people are
bound to miss the hugetlb pages because just about every single
pagetable walk has to be specially coded to handle or avoid them.  We
obviously missed it, here, and we had two good examples in the same
file! :)
