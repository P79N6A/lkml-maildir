Or you use 4MB pages.  That tends to work much better and has less 
complexity.  Shared page tables don't work well on x86 when you have 
a database trying to access an SGA larger than the virtual address 
space, as each process tends to map its own window into the buffer 
pool.  Highmem with 32 bit va just plain sucks.  The right answer is 
to change the architecture of the application to not run with 5000 
unique processes.
