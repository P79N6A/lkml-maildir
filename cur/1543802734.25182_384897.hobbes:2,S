I would prefer:
  	data.block[0] = length;
 	memcpy(&data.block[1], values, length);
... because it goes with the data.block[0] above it. Same for the copy
back later.
And yes, memcpy() should be about as optimized as you can get, certainly
at least as fast as the copy-loop, maybe more, and it uses less code.
