Subject: [PATCH 0/22] fsaio, pipe aio and aio poll upgraded to 2.6.7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Its been a while since I last posted the retry based AIO patches
that I've been accumulating. Janet Morgan recently brought
the whole patchset up-to to 2.6.7.
The patchset contains modifications and fixes to the AIO core
to support the full retry model, an implementation of AIO
support for buffered filesystem AIO reads and O_SYNC writes
(the latter courtesy O_SYNC speedup changes from Andrew Morton),
an implementation of AIO reads and writes to pipes (from
Chris Mason) and AIO poll (again from Chris Mason).
