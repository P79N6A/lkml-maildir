 All three suspend/resume methods are always called while holding the
 usb_device's PM mutex.  For external events -- but not necessarily for
-autosuspend or autoresume -- the device semaphore (udev->dev.sem) will
-also be held.  This implies that external suspend/resume events are

 mutually exclusive with calls to probe, disconnect, pre_reset, and
 post_reset; the USB core guarantees that this is true of internal
 suspend/resume events as well.

 The rules for locking order are:
 
-	Never acquire any device semaphore while holding any PM mutex.
+	Never acquire any device mutex while holding any PM mutex.
 
 	Never acquire udev->pm_mutex while holding the PM mutex for
 	a device that isn't a descendant of udev.
 
 In other words, PM mutexes should only be acquired going up the device
 tree, and they should be acquired only after locking all the device
-semaphores you need to hold.  These rules don't matter to drivers very
+mutexes.  These rules don't matter to drivers very
 much; they usually affect just the USB core.
 
 Still, drivers do need to be careful.  For example, many drivers use a
