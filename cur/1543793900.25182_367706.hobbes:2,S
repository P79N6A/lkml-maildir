Lee,
   I've been reading that thread with interest. Thanks.
   Also, at this point I have no reason to believe that I'm not 100%
xrun free with the right set of apps, meaning I cannot really say any
xrun I see today is kernel induced. (They may be...I just cannot say
that.) For instance, I've yet to see an xrun in days of using Ardour
and running Jack from a terminal. However running Jack from QJC and
using Aqualung results in one or two every few days. This is a low
level issue from my perspective.
   My interest is, in general, audio only. However, on the odd
afternoon I have no qualms about rebooting into a different kernel or
a different video driver that might support a bit of game playing.
That's all that's going on here. Someone recently said there might be
PCI Express support in 2.6.15 so I was just looking.
   That said, over the last couple of years I have done a couple of
jobs that are sound track related. (Pro Tools, Vegas, etc. under XP)
I'm keeping my eyes open for a tool set that might allow me a similar
opportunity one of these days under Linux. (No rush at all)
   Note: It may not be obvious, but I'm young(-ish), retired, and
pretty much get to do what I want now. The only thing that stops me
from doing this on two machines is space and noise concerns.
   Thanks for all your inputs. You've been a great help.
cheers,
Mark
