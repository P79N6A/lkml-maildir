This tunable caused an 11% performance difference in (I assume) TPCx. 
That's a big deal, and people will want to diddle it.
If one number works optimally for all machines and workloads then fine.
But yes, avoiding a tunable would be nice, but we need a tunable to work
out whether we can avoid making it tunable ;)
Not that I'm soliciting patches or anything.  I'll duck this one for now.
