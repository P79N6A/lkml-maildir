I've been debugging some timer bugs in a daemon library I'm developing
and have been stracing it.  Among many things done are a variety of
kills, including -KILL, -INT, -TERM and -HUP, while being straced.
When I do the kill, I see strace output showing the events correctly
and in the case of -KILL the process definitely goes away.
This is with kernel 2.4.13.  So this is not a broad problem and may be
specific to states vtund is in, or changes since 2.4.13, or both.
