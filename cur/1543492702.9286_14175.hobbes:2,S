If some of the suggestions that I have seen posted (change ELF to FLE for
the sig for example) would not have this capability, and you are still
faced with the problems of shared filesystems (I am not talking about the
use of capability bits in the ELF header for this I am referig to the
alternatives I have seen posted.)

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
