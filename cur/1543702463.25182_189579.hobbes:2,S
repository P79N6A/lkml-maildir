	Um, adding all 16 partitions for a block device that has 5
defined is opposite of the intention of udev, no?  While I'd prefer the
partition code in-kernel provide hotplug events for each partition, if
it is instead scanned by udev, udev should indeed scan the partition
table.  Remember, udev should be able to give the appropriate
system-defined names for the partition, not just 'sda1'.
