okay, it seems that some code that restarts a hung chip has been
added.

aha? I see stalls occuring frequently too, but earlier than 2mb. the
card is then resetted by "NETDEV WATCHDOG", which appears in dmesg,
and you'll also see a "transmit timeout eth0" (or something similar).
so, if the patch is for a chip that does not recover, I guess it
will not address this problem then (because the netdev-watchdog restarts
the chip which *does* recover then).
my concern is that both vt6102 and vt6103 have been assigned the same
pci-device-id by via. I dont think that the via-rhine driver does
differ the two chips and treats the 6103 as a 6102.
also, on ftp.via.com.tw/...NIC/VT6103, there are no chip-specs, as
opposed to the 6102 and 6105-directory. I've just mailed to
robert_kuo@via.com.tw, I hope they will put up the missing specs.
do you know of any other sources of specs beside ftp.via.com.tw?
regards,
h.rosmanith
