Subject: printk() without KERN_ prefixes? (in 2.5.59) and Q: small kernel image doc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello everybody,
until now I believed that all printk()'s should have a KERN_ prefix - but to 
my surprise it ain't so:
	grep printk -r . | grep -v "KERN_" | wc -l
	  29932
	grep printk -r . | grep -v "KERN_" | cut -d: -f1 | uniq | wc -l
	   2636
so there are ~ 30 000 printk() lines in 2600 files which don't have such a 
specifier.
Should they be fixed to KERN_INFO or some such? I'm willing to contribute a 
patch (which will be done by script, of course). Or am I missing something 
and they shall stay as they are?
I'm looking at this part as I'm trying to get a smaller kernel image, as my 
boot media (1.44 MB disk :-( is getting full (yes I know that there's a lot I 
can do about userspace too :-) and so I'm thinking about dropping all 
KERN_DEBUG, maybe KERN_INFO and possible KERN_NOTICE to save some space. I 
remember having read some ideas (and possibly a web reference) on lkml in 
mid-2002 but couldn't find them yet.
Anyway, are there some other resources on the web for building small kernel's? 
(that is, small kernel images, not for use in small machines). I already 
searched a bit and found some sites (mulinux, superant/smalllinux, 
linuxrouter, linux embedding, small unix, ...)
I know that I could use an older kernel (2.0 or 2.2) but because of driver 
maturity (ie. workarounds for bugs in recent hardware) and performance I'd 
like to use current kernels.
Regards,
Phil
