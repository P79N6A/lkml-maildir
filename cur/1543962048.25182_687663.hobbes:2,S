hey, sorry about invading your turf of trivial patches ;) I dont see it 
as a problem that the thought process and the initial patch is 
incomplete and ad-hoc. My preference is to work with people out in the 
open, even on trivial issues. Dmitry is a capable maintainer who 
understands his code very well and he'll resist me if i'm full of it. 
Just like i resisted you when you were full of it. That's what 
maintainers do, their job is to know their code.
And, occasionally, as in this case, i might end up being faced with a 
bug in the code i maintain ;)
