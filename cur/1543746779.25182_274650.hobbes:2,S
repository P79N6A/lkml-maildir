Hi,
Since I started using 2.6.10-rc kernels, my usb flashdrive only seems to
be partially detected by HAL. It shows up fine in dmesg, the device is
detected and the partitions recognised, however in the HAL device
manager it shows as a SCSI host interface, without the volume being
detected underneath it. This all works fine on 2.6.9 running the same
kernel options.
Anybody got any ideas, before I go compiling kernels to find out where
it changed?
Cheers,
Eamonn
