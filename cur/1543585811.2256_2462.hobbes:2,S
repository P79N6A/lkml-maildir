Support for building third party drivers and patch sets as separate
source trees.  Base kernel in in one source tree, external patch or
driver set is in another source tree, kbuild reads from multiple source
trees and writes to a separate object directory.  The multiple source
trees break the assumption that all source is in one tree, lines like
  #include <../drivers/scsi/aic7xxx.h>
do not work with multiple sources.
You are right about the long compile lines though, example with three
source trees, reflowed for readability.
