I wouldn't count on it. The 'normal' USB controller (uhci,ohci,ehci(usb
2.0)) specs are defined in terms of PCI accesses. PCMCIA means no PCI, so
even if such a card exists, I think it is very unlikely to work with
(semi)standard drivers.
However, someone on this list once mentinned he had an ISA USB adapter, so
you never know.
