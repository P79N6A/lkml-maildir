That's good to know.  Being able to grow (online of course!) is great,
but so would shrinking as well.   It makes life so much more flexible
for the SysAdmins, which is my particular focus... since it's my day
job.

So let me get this straight.  Are you saying that quotas would only be
on the volume level, and for the initial level of sub-volumes below
that level?  Or would *all* sub-volumes have quota support?  And does
that include snapshots as well?

Neat.  As long as the idea is kept around a bit, that would be nice
for an eventual addition.  Or maybe someone needs to come up with a
stackable filesystems to take care of this...
