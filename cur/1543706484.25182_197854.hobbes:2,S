The reiserfs commit option doesn't work to suppress reiserfs journal
writing to disk. The value that needs to be changes is the transaction
max age instead of the commit max age which is being change now.

commit option (there is no reset to default commit value option at the
moment).
It won't take too long but if anyone is impatient I can send them a
patch to fix reiserfs.
