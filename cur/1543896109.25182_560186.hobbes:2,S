    I'm not sure why these are copied *only* here. Shouldn't they be copied 
only once, at init. time?

    Yeah, at least new_xsec calculation is duplicated in timer_recalc_offset()..

    Why? By the time it gets called (form the timer softirq context) 
tb_last_jiffy should've been incremented. Well, this won't happen wither in or 
right after the timer interrupt... since timer has no IRQ on PowerPC -- it 
signals "exception". Well, HRT works somehow anyway. :-)

    Moreover, it will get called for settimeofday() as well which would seem 
to double the overhead since your clocksource hook will get called beforehand.
