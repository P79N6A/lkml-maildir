Here's a better fix for the kernel stack data
leaking out into user-space. (due to padding)
This fix takes advantage of the fact that an i386
machine is little-endian. The type of st_rdev may
be widened to fill the gap, causing the extra 2
bytes to get zeroed when st_rdev is written to.
Everybody: use -Wpadded to find these
