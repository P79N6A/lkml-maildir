   2.4.14-pre6 on UP alpha, newly reformatted and reinstalled :)
   Machine was nowhere near OOM, and no other adverse messages appeared in
   dmesg.  An rpm build and an rpm install were running in parallel.
Hmmm... the oops suggests that truncate_complete_page() gets a page
not in the page cache.  The page count should be at least 2 when
it gets passed there.
Franks a lot,
