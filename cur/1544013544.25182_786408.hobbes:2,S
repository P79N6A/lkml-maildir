Fine.  However you want to describe that last second is immaterial.  The
point is that diddling the clock is not a true solution.  Take seconds
since epoch for January 1 and subtract the seconds since epoch since the
previous day and if the result isn't 86401 it's wrong.  Is Linux wrong? 
(I gather it is.)
