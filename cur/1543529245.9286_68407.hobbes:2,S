I may be wrong, so would someone more knowledgeable about Linux's
implementation of NFS please either confirm or refute me.
I've seen this sort of problem on other NFS implementations when the
permissions on the underlying directory were wrong. Unmount the NFS directory,
and do "ls -d -l" on the underlying directory being used for the mount point.
Insure that its permissions are at least "r-xr-xr-x" (555). Then remount the
NFS directory to see if the problem goes away.
