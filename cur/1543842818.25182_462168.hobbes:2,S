Don't start the new container or change the guarantees of the existing ones
to accommodate this one :) The QoS design (done by the administrator) should
take care of such use-cases. It would be perfectly ok to have a container
that does not care about guarantees to set their guarantee to 0 and set
their limit to the desired value. As Chandra has been stating we need two
parameters (guarantee, limit), either can be optional, but not both.
