Hello all.  Just to add some data points, I've timed
the compile of kernel under stock kernels UP 2.2.0-pre4 
through pre6 and under 2.1.131. Hope you will find useful.
 For each, in sequence the commands
  make clean
  time make -jn zImage
are applied for successive values of n=4,4,5,6, and 7.
Since in real life one hopes the cache to contain useful "stuff", 
my idea is to simulate this with the first compile, in order 
to "precondition"  the cache/buffers.
Second and subsequent compiles with increasing j-values to simulate
performance under increasing cpu load.  Granted it's very artificial;
just trying to mimic my typical use pattern; and also trying to avoid 
case where memory starvation is major factor.
Reported are total elapsed time (minute:sec) for each compile.
Processor is K6-266 with 32MB memory, 512k cache memory.
Kernel |  j4(1)  j4    j5    j6   j7
--------------------------------------
220-6  | 4:53   4:40  4:53  5:15  5:54
220-5  | 4:50   4:39  4:55  5:00  6:16
220-4  | 4:59   4:45  4:57  5:34  5:52
2.1.131| 4:49   4:45  5:20  6:25  8:02
--------------------------------------
It appears the 2.2.0-pre series are making better use of the 
"preconditioning", with pre5 and pre6 showing the smoothest
response to increasing j values for the 'make'.  
For the qualitative look and feel, I have an informal personal
benchmark which involves rapidly displaying a cyclic sequence 
(51) of large (600x800) X11 bitmaps while doing text editing 
with xemacs, which I have been following since version 2.1.109.
Strong preference for the pre-6 kernel among all those tested.
