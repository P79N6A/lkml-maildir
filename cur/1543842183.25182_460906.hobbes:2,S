Hmm, well, kevent_user and ukevent are perhaps the only ones I'm concerned 
about. What about calling kevent_user a kevent_queue, kevent_fd or 
kevent_set?

Hmm. The concern here is pinned memory, is it not? I'm trying to think of 
the best way to avoid compile-time limits. select() has a rather 
(infamous) compile-time limit of 1,024 thanks to libc (and thanks to the 
bit vector, a glass ceiling). Now, you'd be a fool to use select() on that many
fd's in modern code meant to run on modern UNIXes. But kevent is a new 
system, the grand unified event loop all of us userspace programmers have 
been begging for since many years ago. Glass ceilings tend to hurt when 
you run into them :)
Using the size of the memory mapped buffer as queue length sounds like a 
sane simplification.

You are right about my first suggestion sometimes coming up a page extra. 
What I'm worried about is that the current ALIGN() based calculation comes 
up a page short if KEVENT_MAX_EVENTS is certain values (say 4095). This is 
because the "unsigned int index" is inside kevent_mring for every page, 
though the ALIGN() calculation just factors in room for one of them. In 
these boundary cases (KEVENT_MAX_EVENTS == 4095), your calculation thinks 
it can fit one last mukevent on a page because it didn't factor in room 
for "unsigned int index" at the start of every page; rather just for one 
page. In this case, the modulus should always come up non-zero, giving us 
the extra required page.

Interesting idea. It would certainly simplify the interface.

Obviously it's not a huge deal :)
If kevent is to screw up the hard drive, though, we must put in an 
exception for it to avoid my music directory.

Thanks again!
