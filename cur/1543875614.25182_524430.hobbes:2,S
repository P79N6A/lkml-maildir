Thanks. Can this go to Doc*/ somewhere?
...but... If I can attack your system using knoppix, I can get at your
data, already, right? So you'll need to encrypt your data, anyway?

How does passphrase work here?
...so you have your data encrypted, and you have bootloader that
verifies kernel/initrd (you need that, anyway). Because you data are
encrypted, knoppix attack will not work... assuming crypto does some
integrity checks, but IIRC crypto needs to do that.
							Pavel,
who is afraid, that this code will come back and bite him. He has
nightmares of opening PS4 box as a christmas gift, then not being able
to hack his new hardware.
