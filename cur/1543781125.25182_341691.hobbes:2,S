I still don't see why you can't lift your flags up into the VMA.  The rmap 
mechanism is there precisely to let you get from the physical page to the 
users and user data, including VMAs.
I am also not sure why you are talking about efficiency here.  Did you measure 
the impact on suspend performance?
