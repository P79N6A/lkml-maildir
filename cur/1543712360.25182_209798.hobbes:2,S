Sorry - I plead ignorance :-)  As the protection is recursive and
transitive, I suppose that you could do this. When the UMK (user mode
kernel) went to change the "real" machine it would get a protection fault
that would be handled by the KMK, emulating the effect. Getting it right and
also performant would be tricky though - is UML a necessary feature?

Pretection is in the *virtual* space, not physical. The physical-page
manager (who has the TLB and underlying mapping tables in its space) can see
and deal with any physical address, which in turn has the usual aliasing
relationship with virtual addresses. Of course, physical is just one of the
virtual spaces (and is distinguished solely by the one-to-one
virtual-physical mapping). So the protection can be penetrated by anyone who
can see the underlying physical page - but that's always true.

Nope. Apertures in the memory controller. We looked at doing I/O in virtual,
but the extra traffic on the pins was too expensive (although it did permit
I/O onto paged memory). But it's easy to give each IO its own aperture base,
just by adding a few more high-order bits to the address, and the controller
can make sure that each DMA stays in its aperture. Sort of a poor-man's MMU

I fear that it might be more extensive than that :-)
