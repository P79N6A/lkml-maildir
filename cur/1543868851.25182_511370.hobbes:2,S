But it is still RCU friendly? destroy_nbp() is rcu-callback which
calls release_nbp() if we have a last reference to ->kobj. This
means that dev_put() may be done a bit later, but not earlier.
And RCU can only garantee "not before", any rcu-callback could be
delayed unpredictably.

I can't understand any single word in the paragraph above :)
But the bug (the stable tree has it too) is real. If this patch is
really wrong, could you please take care of it?
