I've not found the cause of this, but I've seen a similar issue w/ RHEL
3.0. It seems to have to do w/ glibc being compiled to use some feature
(futexes?) which is not available in self-compiled kernels. I found
replacing the i686 compiled glibc w/ the i386 compiled package solved
the issue for me.  Your mileage may vary. 
I'd be interested to hear the real cause. 
thanks
