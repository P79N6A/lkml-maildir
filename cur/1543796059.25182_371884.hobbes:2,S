Well, it's a sign of convergence :)

Lower overhead? Lemme absolutely disagree with you. Please be aware that 
memory allocation routines are abstract, so no necessary memory allocation.
Yeah, anyway, your latest core doesn't look DMA-unsafe to me.

Your taking semaphore in spi_write_then_read which all the sync routines 
are based on may lead to priority inversion and of course is not optimal 
in terms of overall performance, if there's more than one controller 
(have you tested your core in this situation BTW?)
Suppose you have two kernel threads with different priorities dealing 
with SPI controller each... Of course you'll get priority inversion when 
the thread with higher prio will wait for semaphore release!

It's just a *reasonable* _default_ policy.
