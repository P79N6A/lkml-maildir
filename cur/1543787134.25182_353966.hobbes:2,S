I doubt if multcount will make a difference, but you can try.
Probably next best thing to do is profile the slow kernel to find where it 
is spending time. (pass profile=2 on kernel command line and use 
readprofile or use oprofile).
Did you try hdparm -tT /dev/hda? It's going to be slow, thats for sure 
from what you described but try that and then post dmesg (for both 
kernels) and profile results - may be someone will get a clue from that.
