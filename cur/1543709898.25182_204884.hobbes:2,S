what other apps use gigs of shared memory where that shared memory is
not an IO cache?

dropping pte_chains on mlock() we implemented in RHEL3 and it works fine
to reduce the pte_chain overhead for those extreme shm users.
mind you, it still doesnt make high-end DB workloads viable on 32 GB
systems. (and no, not due to the pte_chain overhead.) 3:1 is simply not
enough at 32 GB and higher [possibly much ealier, for other workloads]. 
Trying to argue otherwise is sticking your head into the sand.
most of the anti-rmap sentiment (not this patch - this patch looks OK at
first sight, except the increase in struct page) is really backwards.
The right solution is to have rmap which is a _per page_ overhead and
the clear path to a mostly O(1) VM logic. Then we can increase the page
size (pgcl) to scale down the rmap overhead (both the per-page and the
locking overhead). What's so hard about this concept? Simple and
flexible data structure.
the x86 highmem issues are a quickly fading transient in history.
