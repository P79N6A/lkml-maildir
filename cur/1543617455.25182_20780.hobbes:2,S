Marcelo,
The issue here is not whether drivers can do 4K IO relaibly. If you
go thro filesystem, they are doing I/Os in 4K chunks. Infact, the I/Os
get coalsed into bigger size (64K etc).
The issue here is, whether drivers can handle buffer heads with
multiple sizes (b_size) in a single IO (coalsed) request. Inorder to
address this concern, I limited my patch to work only with few tested 
SCSI drivers for now. So I think, I already addressed 'safety' issue 
with untested drivers. 
But if you want to get some testing thro -ac kernels, I will be happy
to go that route. I already sent a version to Alan for consideration 
to next -ac kernel.
Regards,
Badari
