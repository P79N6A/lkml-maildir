Subject: [PATCH] kernel/sys.c : Get rid of expensive divides in groups_sort()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

groups_sort() can be quite long if user loads a large gid table.
This is because GROUP_AT(group_info, some_integer) uses an integer divide.
So having to do XXX thousand divides during one syscall can lead to very high 
latencies. (NGROUPS_MAX=65536)
In the past (25 Mar 2006), an analog problem was found in groups_search()
(commit d74beb9f33a5f16d2965f11b275e401f225c949d ) and at that time I changed 
some variables to unsigned int.
I believe that a more generic fix is to make sure NGROUPS_PER_BLOCK is unsigned.
