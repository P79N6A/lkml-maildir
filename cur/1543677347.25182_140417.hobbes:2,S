Best case 128 bytes - ppc64 cacheline size. Worst case 512 bytes - our
pci-pci bridge likes to prefetch in 512 byte increments. From Herman's
data you can see this in action:
Linux sending one 1514 byte packet   (777 Mbits sec rate)
      Address     PCI command Bytes xfered
      420A8       MRM         344
      42200       MRM         512
      42400       MRM         512
      42600       MRL         128
      42680       MR           18
With the buffer 512 byte aligned this is completed in 3 transactions.
Yes the hardware could be more intelligent about these unaligned
transactions but we cant do much about that now.
We might be able to do the alignment at a higher level but its not
straightforward (see my previous mail).

Lets ignore TCE lookup overhead for the moment. As Herman pointed all
these DMAs should occur on the same page.
