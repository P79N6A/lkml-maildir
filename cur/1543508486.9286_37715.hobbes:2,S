	This is a template.
    i = open("/dev/ttyS0", O_RDWR|O_NDELAY);   /* Open non-delay */
    j = open("/dev/ttyS1,  O_RDWR|O_NDELAY");
    fcntl(i, ... ~O_NDELAY);      /* Restore delay */
    fcntl(j, ... ~O_NDELAY);
    ioctl(i, TCSETS, &termios);   /* Set to binary mode */
    ioctl(j, TCSETS, &termios);
    for(;;)
    {
       select(i+1....)    /* Timeout on select about 2 character times */
       {
           len = read(i, buf, LEN);
