   This patch fixes an obvious bug introduced with the ext2 changes in
   2.2.18pre (look up the definition of le32_to_cpu on BE machines
   without a special assembler version for it and on machines that
   have it)

Durr, this explains why small bits my home directory disk got
corrupted while running 2.2.18pre, nice spotting Andi :-)
