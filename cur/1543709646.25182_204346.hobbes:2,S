Hi,
I've Soltek SL-75FRV mainboard (VIA KT400 and vt8235 chipsets).
Also i've two IDE disk both runing on UDMA(100) (DMA enabled).
I'm using 2.4.22 kernel from Fedora Core 1 + patch for XFS suppport.
Several checking md5 sum of big file (650MB) give different results
(e.g: first, second and third* *file check give good md5 sum, but fourth 
check give bad sum).
Also if i copy big file through network (ethernet), file have bits 
difference, the same
thing happen during file copy (also big file) betwen two disks.
Usually there are from 1 to 3 differneces in file, each difference is 
one bit  (e.g good file - 4B, bad file - 4A).
That is not a memory problem because memtest86 shows no errors.
I found some old message:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0111.0/0914.html
where author had similar problem to mine.
Could you give me some hints how to more deeply diagnose this problem.
