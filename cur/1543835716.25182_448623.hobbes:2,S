What code duplication?  Doing it the way I suggested doesn't require 
adding any new code at all.  You, on the other hand, added several 
routines for bus glue that does virtually nothing.

Yes it does.  From uhci-hcd.c:
static struct pci_driver uhci_pci_driver = {
        .name =         (char *)hcd_name,
        .id_table =     uhci_pci_ids,
        .probe =        usb_hcd_pci_probe,
        .remove =       usb_hcd_pci_remove,
        .shutdown =     uhci_shutdown,
	^
--------^ See this?
#ifdef  CONFIG_PM
        .suspend =      usb_hcd_pci_suspend,
        .resume =       usb_hcd_pci_resume,
#endif  /* PM */
};

The shutdown routine doesn't have to be consistent with other functions 
because it runs in a very special environment.  Furthermore, those other 
functions use bus glue because they need to do a lot of things in common 
with other HCDs.  A shutdown method doesn't need to do those things.
