Yep. Specially when new 2.5.X-preY or 2.5.X are generated at a rate of 2 or
3 a week. Look at the history of the kernel. This would only create even
_more_ pressure to get new patches in, and that is bad.
When a freeze (or slush) is decreed at the very end, it makes sense.
Remember that a large part of the success of Linux is due to "Release
early, release often".
