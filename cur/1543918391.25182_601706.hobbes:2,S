Nope: Intel(R) Pentium(R) D CPU 3.20GHz

Not really. With that first test I did have:
$ cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
tsc
If I boot with 'notsc', I get:
cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
hpet
But the problem is still exactly the same:

Some relevant lines from kernel log:

hpet0: at MMIO 0xfed00000, IRQs 2, 8, 0
hpet0: 3 64-bit timers, 14318180 Hz

I tried your script, but the clock runs perfectly. Never saw anything
other than a 1 second increment.
The following may well be relevant.
With 2.6.22 and early 2.6.23-rc kernels (rc3-rc6) I often had this in my
kernel log (see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/16/45
):
   checking TSC synchronization [CPU#0 -> CPU#1]:
   Measured 248 cycles TSC warp between CPUs, turning off TSC clock.
   Marking TSC unstable due to check_tsc_sync_source failed
Some boots the TSC synchronization would be OK, but I'd see ~2/3 failures.
Kernels before 2.6.22 did not have this problem.
However, checking my logs now I see that these messages have disappeared
since 2.6.23-rc7. Now the TSC synchronization check always passes.
I also tried with 2.6.22-6 and with that the jumping around is _not_
present. This was a boot where TSC synchronization failed, so with hpet
as clocksource.
Also, the numbers stay constant much longer and have bigger increments
(updates look to be once per minute?):
