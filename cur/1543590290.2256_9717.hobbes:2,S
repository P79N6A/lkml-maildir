Well, then, you don't specify the guard capability!  If your MV147 isn't 
wired for serial, then leave SERIAL off.  The point of the derivation

Sometimes the law defends plunder and participates in it. Sometimes
the law places the whole apparatus of judges, police, prisons and
gendarmes at the service of the plunderers, and treats the victim --
when he defends himself -- as a criminal.
