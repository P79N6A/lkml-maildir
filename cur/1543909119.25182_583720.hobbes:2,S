Laurent's patch gives the best of both worlds: on old 'top', you get 
guest time accounted as user time, while on new 'top' it is accounted 
separately.  This is done by reporting user time as the sum of the real 
user time and guest time.  A newer 'top' can subtract guest time from 
user time to get the correct statistic.

Okay, so the code should be under that config option, and kvm should 
select it.
