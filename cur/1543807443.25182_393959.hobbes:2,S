That's all very interesting, but is purely based on some statistical
analysis of some workload of your choice, and ignores other possible
measures like contention or average/max hold times.
One could concoct a workload for which some other lock is the "*most*
central", strangely enough.
Anyway I'm not trying to say that the runqueue locks are not important,
nor that large latencies should not be avoided in the mainline kernel..
But we've known about this theoretical latency for years, ditto for
rwsem latency (which can also be a central lock in some workloads). I
was simply surprised that you just now jump into action when you see
an equally theoretical workload show you what you already know.
Enough talk from me. I'm looking at a couple of ideas which might help
to improve this too.
