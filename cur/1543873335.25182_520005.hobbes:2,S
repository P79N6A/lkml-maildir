User beancounters patch has got through all these...
The approach where each charged object has a pointer to the owner container,
who has charged it - is the most easy/clean way to handle
all the problems with dynamic context change, races, etc.
and 1 pointer in page struct is just 0.1% overehad.

big PAE doesn't make any difference IMHO
(until struct pages are not created for non-present physical memory areas)

But it lacks some other features:
1. page can't be shared easily with another container
2. shared page can't be accounted honestly to containers
   as fraction=PAGE_SIZE/containers-using-it
3. It doesn't help accounting of kernel memory structures.
   e.g. in OpenVZ we use exactly the same pointer on the page
   to track which container owns it, e.g. pages used for page
   tables are accounted this way.
4. I guess container destroy requires destroy of memory zone,
   which means write out of dirty data. Which doesn't sound
   good for me as well.
5. memory reclamation in case of global memory shortage
   becomes a tricky/unfair task.
6. You cannot overcommit. AFAIU, the memory should be granted
   to node exclusive usage and cannot be used by by another containers,
   even if it is unused. This is not an option for us.
