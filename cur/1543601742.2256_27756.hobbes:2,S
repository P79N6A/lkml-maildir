age - PAGE_AGE_DECL may be a 2^32-1 or so, but when you cast it back to int,
it is at most 2^31 again. It rolls over, so you get the sign bit back.
Witness:
vherva@linux:/home/vherva>cat n.c
#define FOUR 4
void main()
{
   unsigned three = 3;
   printf("%u\n", three - FOUR);
   printf("%i\n", (int)(three - FOUR));
   printf("%i\n", (int)three - (int)FOUR);
}
vherva@linux:/home/vherva>./a.out
4294967295
-1
-1
Perhaps a lucky incidence, but it works as Daniel wrote it. (At least on
32-bit architecture.)
I agree that Rik's variant is much more readable.
