On average very well, that is, the time spent in finding
the next pid is very small on average, but once in a while
there is a small hiccup.
On a hard real time system it may be reasonable to choose
for an average that is ten times higher and avoid the hiccup.
For systems that really have lots of very short-lived
processes, one might do what I suggested a moment ago
for a MP context: have the processes live in several lists,
that each only use part of the pid-space.
(One wants for_each_task to take a limited amount of time.
With N tasks, and sqrt(N) list heads one first picks the
shortest list, then loops over the list, all in time of order
sqrt(N). That works well, certainly up to a million processes.)
