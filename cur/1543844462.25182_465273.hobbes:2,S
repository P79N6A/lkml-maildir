Very strange, I rebooted into deadline scheduler kernel, the drive
performed as fast as with 2.6.17, due to a different problem I had to
do a hard reset and the box booted back into 2.6.18 with anticipatory
scheduler, but this time the dirve performed fine!
I had initially upgraded the kernel remotely and had only done
shutdown now -r, not a hard reset, Is it generally advisable to do a
hard reset when upgrading the kernel? (ive never read that) Is there
any way to do that remotely?
One last question, I recently got a sata dvd writer for this box as
the pata ports on the jmicron were not supported, I notice there is
now support for them in 2.6.18 (with generic ide), but which would be
best supported ? the sata dvdrw or the pata? I currently have both
available and neither is installed.
Thanks
Andy
