DK or DKIM comes to mind. SpamAssassin 3.1.5 handles it neatly.
Off hand expecting a list to maintain perfect anti-spam is rather
difficult. Distributed processing works better. Folks should have
their own anti-spam tools and train them to their own preferences.
(It helps with a list like this one to have a SpamAssassin meta
rule that boosts the scores for BAYES_80 and above while reducing
scores for BAYES_40 and below. It also helps to run a lot of the
SARE, SpamAssassin Rules Emporium, rule sets. Pick and choose for
your particular needs.
