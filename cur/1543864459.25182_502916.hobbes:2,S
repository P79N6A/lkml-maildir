Why do you ignore reality?
MSI does *not* work fine, exactly because the firmware screws it up.
The fact that on a "hardware level" it may work is totally irrelevant. The 
*only* thing that matters is what people actually see.
"Positivism" may not be a hot philosophy these days any more, but dang, it 
certainly is better than what you seem to espouse: "in theory things work 
fine".
And if you don't like positivism, how about just simple scientific method: 
a theory is *proven*wrong* by a single observation to the opposite. And we 
have several people standing up saying that your theory is wrong.
