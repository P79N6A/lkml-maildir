The output of lspci -vvv is here 
http://pastebin.com/f126dc794
 and it is 
exactly the same on 2.6.27.10 and 2.6.28. I noticed various Thinkpad 
models besdies Subsystem. They are all very close to mine but not 
exactly A22m. Could this mean I need to tweak the DSDT file?
Should I try the above patch at the risk of having to use a custom 
kernel for the rest of my life or do you think there's a way to fix this 
without breaking other systems?
