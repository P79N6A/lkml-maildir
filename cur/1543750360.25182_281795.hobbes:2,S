Subject: bug: cd-rom autoclose no longer works (fix attempt)

Hello.
CD-ROM autoclose stopped working in
2.6 kernels quite some time ago.
Attached is the patch that fixes it
for me.
The ide-cd.c change is as per 2.4.20
which works. For some reasons
sense.ascq == 0 for me when the tray
is opened.
The cdrom.c change is here because
rigth after the tray closed,
drive_status() returns CDS_DISK_OK
even when there is no disk, which
probably only means that the tray
was successfully closed. Calling
drive_status() again gets the right
status.
With this patch autoclose works again.
Can someone please make any sense
out of it?
