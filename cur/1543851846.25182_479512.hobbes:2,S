So, the reasoning behind this, is that we have this construct..
config X86_POWERNOW_K8_ACPI
    bool
    depends on X86_POWERNOW_K8 && ACPI_PROCESSOR
    depends on !(X86_POWERNOW_K8 = y && ACPI_PROCESSOR = m)
    default y
Which makes us use the ACPI stuff if it's there, otherwise not,
and in your case, it seems your system _needs_ this enabled
to make powernow work.
Thing is, this was there in 2.6.18 too, so strictly speaking,
we haven't regressed here, and you're getting exactly what you asked for.
The problem is that it's completely silent as to why it then fails.
I'm open to improvements, but I'm not sure what the right thing to do
here is.. opinions ?
