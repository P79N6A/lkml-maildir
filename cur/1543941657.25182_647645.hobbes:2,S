FWIW I'm in complete agreement if you are referring to
CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES and not just this patch...
As to the rest, the short version:
* The sendmail thing was a subtle problem trying to map setuid(non-0)
into a capability framework. The long and the short of it was that an
unprivileged user could prevent a privileged application from exercising
all of the privilege it needed and getting root access as a result.
* I'm saying setuid(0) apps will most definitely continue to be
supported by a kernel even with CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES=y. All
the patch does is make it possible for a capable(CAP_SETPCAP) process to
declare itself as the parent of a process tree in which that is not the
case.
Here is the very very long version (which took some time to write, and I
thought was a bit much to spam these lists with):
