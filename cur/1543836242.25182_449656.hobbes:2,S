That would be my preference as well - I don't really have the bandwidth 
to do a full review / test and integration of Stas's patch right now.  
Subtle isn't really the word for this change - NMIs, debug handling, 
sysenter, kernel stack copying, segment registers, interrupts, kernel 
exception fixup, 16-bit stacks, descriptor tables and now CFI 
annotations all come into play.  Basically, all the evil and tricky 
parts of i386 all come out to play together, and the control flow is 
non-linear in places.  Sadomasochistic is a more appropriate word.  But 
it is a very nice change, and I would like to see it merged into -mm 
eventually.  I actually have an ad-hoc test suite that tests most of 
these paths, but I've never gotten formal and rigorous enough with it to 
publish.  I'll see if I can do that sometime in the next two weeks ;)
