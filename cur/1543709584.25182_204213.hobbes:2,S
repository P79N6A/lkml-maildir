Does it need fixing??
If you remove this, then people who compile a kernel without nfsd
support, and then later decide to compile an nfsd module and load it,
will not be able to mount the nfsd filesystem at the right place.
You might say "that won't happen", but it does, and has.
You might say "they shouldn't do that", and maybe they shouldn't.  But
it still causes a support burden on the mailing list.
I think it is a very small cost, and a measurable gain, to leave it
there.
Do you really think otherwise?
