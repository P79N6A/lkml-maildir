i could agree with this oneliner patch for 2.6.9, it only affects the
SMP balancer and there for the most common boxes it likely results in a
similar migration cutoff as the 2.5 msec we currently have. Here are the
changes that occur on a couple of x86 boxes:
 2-way celeron, 128K cache:         2.5 msec -> 1.0 msec 
 2-way/4-way P4 Xeon 1MB cache:     2.5 msec -> 2.0 msec
 8-way P3 Xeon 2MB cache:           2.5 msec -> 6.0 msec
each of these changes is sane and not too drastic.
(on ia64 there is no auto-tuning of cache_decay_ticks, there you've got
a decay=<x> boot parameter anyway, to fix things up.)
there was one particular DB test that was quite sensitive to idle time
introduced by too large migration cutoff: dbt2-pgsql. Could you try that
one too and compare -rc3 performance to -rc3+migration-patches?

yeah, it would be nice to test the following 3 kernels:
 2.6.9-rc3 vanilla,
 2.6.9-rc3 + cache_hot_fix + use-cache_decay_ticks
 2.6.9-rc3 + cache_hot_fixes + autotune-patch
using as many different CPU types (and # of CPUs) as possible.
The most important factor in these measurements is statistical stability
of the result - if noise is too high then it's hard to judge. (the
numbers you posted in previous mails are quite stable, but not all
benchmarks are like that.)
