The blacklist rule treats all Latitudes the same, since most of
them are broken. Your C840 may or may not actually work. Simply
remove the blacklist entry in dmi_scan.c and run some tests:
- does it hang at boot?
- does the kernel fail to enable the local APIC? (it's HW absent
  in many mobile CPUs)
- does it hang when the power cord is attached or detached?
- does it hang when the BIOS setup hotkey is pressed?
  (Fn-F1 on my ancient Latitude, may be different now)
- does it hang under long periods of heavy load?
- does it hang when idle for a long time?
- does it hang at suspend or resume?
If it survives these tests, with nmi_watchdog=0 and =2, then
please tell us about it so we can white-list this particular model.
