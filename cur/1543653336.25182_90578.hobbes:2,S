We found out the root cause of this problem.  There are different levels
of privilege in bugzilla, and the bug owners (like Jeff Garzik) have
the privilege to move bugs among different states (like RESOLVED or
CLOSED), but *not* ASSIGNED state.  The original intent of Bugzilla
is that bug owners only work on bugs assigned to them, and the
screening (assigning) bugs is the responsibility of screeners.  I think
this does not apply to kernel bugzilla very well, so we will give bug
owners enough "power" to assign bugs to themselves as well.  Jon has
already given Jeff this power; more will come later (this is a manual
process, sigh :-))
