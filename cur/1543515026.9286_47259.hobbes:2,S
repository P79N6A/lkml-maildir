   On _really_ screwed up files it is worse than that. I recently got
   rid = of two undeletables using debugfs: Directories that had turned
   into block devices with humongous major/minors. They even used triple
   indirect blocks(!). fsck from e2fsprogrs-1.17 segfaulted on them.
Umm... you wouldn't happen to have saved the output of debugfs's stat
command on these badly mangled inodes, would you?  That would be really
helpful towards fixing the bug --- if you can get e2fsck to segfault,
that's a bug.
