What are you talking about?  isd200_ata_command isn't called by 
queuecommand.

Why?  And why do you need to get to the scsi_device in the first place?

Yes.  The three lines of code there are unnecessary.  You should remove
them (and the comment) instead of adding more somewhere else.  Or if
you want to keep them, just add a line to kfree(us->extra) before 
us->extra is set to NULL.

The first patch is okay except for style violations:

This should be
	u8 *sense_buffer;

The "else" should go on the same line as the closing brace, and it
should have its own opening brace.
