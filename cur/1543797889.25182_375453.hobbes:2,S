It shouldn't be done by the kernel. Perhaps a shared configuration, but
the same way keymaps aren't handled by the kernel for the applications,
mouse button remapping shouldn't be there.
On the other hand, we have button remapping in joydev, to support old
applications that can't handle it themselves. By the same logic, it
could be in mousedev, to support remapping of buttons on applications
(older vmware), where there is no way to change it.
