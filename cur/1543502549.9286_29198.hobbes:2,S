	I agree. 
	It's only a few hours since we installed it,
	so maybe it's not a final score, but it works 
	('til now :)
	- 2.2.10 kernel (with the proper acl patch)
	- RH 6.0
	- single processor
	- no large files.
	- no acl on / (on one /data partition only)
	We found only a minor aestetic problem,
	and commented out the debugging message 
	/* printk ("sys_acl_ctl called\n"); */, 
	on line 212 of acl.c.
	When we used the acl code on a large filesystem,
	we had tons of identical messages to cope with... :(
