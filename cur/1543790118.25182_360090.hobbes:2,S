My opinion is that:
	-- rx_errors should count all "on the wire" hardware errors;
	-- rx_missed_errors should count frames w/ no "on the wire"
	errors that cannot be received by the hardware (generally
	due to lack of DMA bufers); and,
	-- rx_discards should count frames dropped by the kernel
	after successful reception by the hardware.
I do _not_ think rx_missed_errors should be counted as part of
rx_errors, but I could be persuaded otherwise.

It does seem like a netdev stats clarification doc would be
appropriate.  Does anyone have the beginnings of this?
