 as usual.
Does that also fix the "crashes on switch back from X11 to text (or
frame buffer) console" that's been around since 2.4.9 or 2.4.10, but not
before, that bites so many users of SuSE Linux 7.3?
de.comp.os.unix.linux.* has at least one report every week. SuSE shipped
kernel 2.4.10 with 7.3.
