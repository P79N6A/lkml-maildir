No, quite the other way around.
For creating a hibernation image you don't have to suspend devices.
Furthermore, you don't want to suspend at least some of them, because you'll
be using them to save the image in a while.  Also, there's no need to worry
about what power state to put the device into, so that it can wake up the
system from the sleep state etc.
We've made hibernation use suspend-specific callbacks and that causes quite
a lot of problems to appear.

No, that is not the way to go, IMO.  We can shut down devices before creating
the image, but not suspend them.

Here, instead of just powering off, we may want to make the system enter a
sleep state (S4 in ACPI systems), which is similar to suspend.

Shutting down devices and reinitializing them is costly.  I wouldn't like to
do that.
Of course, in a proof-of-concept version this is viable, but IMO not in the
final one.
