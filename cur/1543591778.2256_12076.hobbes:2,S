I think you're too pessimistic. Don't mix "disks" and "controllers" --
SCSI adapter with 10 drives attached is a single DMA agent, not 10 agents.
If you're so concerned about Big Iron, go ahead and implement 64-bit PCI
support, it would be right long-term solution. I'm pretty sure that
high-end servers use mostly this kind of hardware.
Oh, well. This doesn't mean that I'm disagreed with what you said. :-)
Driver writers must realize that pci mappings are limited resources.
Ivan.
