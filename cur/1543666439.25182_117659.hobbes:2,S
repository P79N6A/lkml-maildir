I agree that duplicating files into different subarch dirs sure isn't the 
way to go.

I think VPATH has never been meant to be used for anything like this, it 
could be make to work, though it would interfere with the separate src/obj 
thing. But I don't think it's a good idea, we'll have object files 
magically appear without any visible source file, that's just too obscure.
I can basically see two options at this point:

Something like this, but using ln -sf would be nicer, since that avoids 
someone editing the wrong file by mistake.
Or:
Make the build enter mach-default always. However, make compilation of
setup.c and topology.c conditional on CONFIG_X86_DEFAULT_SETUP and
CONFIG_X86_DEFAULT_TOPOLOGY (or combine those two into one config
variable). Then, you'll have to deal with those two variables explicitly
from Kconfig. Basically, set them to n for voyager and visws, y otherwise.
Yes, that means changing another line in Kconfig when you add a new 
subarch, but that doesn't happen all that frequently. And it's sure better 
than crashes on boot because your setup.c disappeared after a bk commit 
and the build chose to use the mach-default one instead...
