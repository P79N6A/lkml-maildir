In my testing of pre-6 I also noticed the same. Got a big dump of binary
data right in the middle of an oops report. I could not tell where it is
coming from, there were certainly a lot of zeros in it ( ^@ ) but it was
probably a few hundred bytes. The file itself looks ok, just looks like a
pile of raw binary data got shoved into it.
