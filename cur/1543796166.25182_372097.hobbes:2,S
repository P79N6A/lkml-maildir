Hi Jeff,
I unfortunately haven't had much time to look at the status of the PAT
code I had been working on. there are really 2 steps to the code:
the first is enabling and configuring the PAT registers. this then
allows a page table entry define that can be passed to traditional
interfaces, such as remap_page_range or change_page_attr. this is
pretty simple and we've been using a similar interface in our driver
for some time now.
the second part was to make sure we didn't create any cache aliasing
via duplicate mappings. this part is a bit more involved and what was
holding everything back. I've been meaning to get back to looking at
this, but really haven't had the time.
I don't know if you still want to limit the additional of the first
step, based on completion of the second step. I can try to set time
aside over the next month to try and sync up and take a look at where
we stand w/ the cachemap portion of the code. I think there where
still issues with gathering/passing in the correct attributes.
Thanks,
Terence
