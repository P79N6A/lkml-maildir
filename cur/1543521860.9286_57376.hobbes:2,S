I've read that LS-120s work for some, but not for me.
I have an  IDE model, it's recognized by  the BIOS, and it's able  to boot a
floppy, however linux doesn't want to deal with it.
isher(@va):~# fdisk /dev/hda
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0x1840-0x1847, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
hda: Q, ATAPI UNKNOWN (type 17) drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: driver not present

Some have suggested to move the LS-120 to  slave (hdb or hdd) but I can't do
that as I have an SCSI only system. Using hdc doesn't make a difference.
Some other  ones have  suggested to  load ide-floppy  (maybe that's  for the
parallel port version), but that didn't do anything either in my case.
Any suggestiongs?
Thanks,
Marc
