This is a bad assumption IMHO. It pushes policy on to the system
designer of a RapidIO network.
It is very possible to use multiple controllers as entry points
in a single RapidIO network fabric space. The reason one would do this
is to provide optimized paths to some endpoints in the system.
If possible, there should never be a policy assumption like this in
kernel space. It's much better to assume that one may or may not
have a unique id space.
