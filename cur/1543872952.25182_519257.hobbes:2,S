I think the problem starts with the question. It supposes the BIOS knows
the answer to the question in the first place. It also supposes we
haven't reconfigured the port in some cases I believe.
My guess is the problem needs approaching from the other end. Ask the
question "What does the ACPI BIOS expect it to be ?". If I follow the
spec correctly we can answer that question by asking what methods (_SDD,
_GTF etc) it provides.
I don't think anything else is reliable.
