You know why the code you reported is *wrong* (besides from how
techincally do things) ? Mixing lower and upper case, using long variable
and function names, etc... are simply a matter of personal taste and you
cannot say that such code is "absolutely" wrong. The code is damn wrong
because it violates about 25 sections of the project's defined CodingStyle
document, that's why it is wrong.
