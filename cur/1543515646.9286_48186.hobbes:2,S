Don't take such opinions as representative of anyone other than the
individual that posted it (the same applies to my comment, although I do
think that people are generally not hostile to portability issues, rather
merely uninformed).  Personally, I try to avoid writing non-portable code,
but the fact of the matter is that it's impossible to ensure that a piece
of code will work properly on an architecture that it hasn't been tested
on.  That said, the fixes are usually pretty simple.
