I think the patch you have is adequate for ext3.  It closes the
important hole.  I think the extra patch for ext3 in the gmane link
above is not entirely necessary so I wouldn't push it for stable.
That doesn't make it a wrong choice for RHEL4 though.
The ext2 patch, on the other hand, should probably go in to stable.
I include it below so you don't have to scrape it off the web page...

---------------------------------
Have ext2 reject file handles with bad inode numbers early.
This prevents bad inode numbers from triggering errors in
ext2_get_inode.
