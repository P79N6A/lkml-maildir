Subject: scsihosts kernel param broken?

Hi,
After tweaking my kernel today and moving my SCSI controller drivers
into the kernel instead of using them as modules, I wanted to use the
scsihosts kernel parameter as described in filesystems/devfs/README, to
tweak the order of my 3ware (3w-xxxx) and Adaptec (aic79xx) [two
controllers] drives.
I'd like:
scsihosts=aic79xx:3w-xxxx:aic79xx
But the aic79xx code is running first, and leaving all my 3ware stuff to
last.
What's broken here?
Please CC me with responses, as I usually just lurk via the mail
archives.
