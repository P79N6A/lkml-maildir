Just updated the bios, there was an update available, but it didn't affect
my situation.
I'm not aware of doing anything different as far as PCI scanning unless
RH6.1's kudzu does anything.  I did have to reconfigure all my device when
going from 2.2.x to 2.3.x, althought the DEC cards were not mentioned in
that reconfigure.
