Zab, great stuff!
I've found a little time to take a look at the patches and throw some 
comments at you.
Keep in mind though, that the last time I seriously looked at this stuff, 
sched.c was like 2K lines of code, and now it's 7K. Enough said ;)

As I said in another email, I think this is a *great* idea. It allows for 
generic async execution, while leaving the core kernel AIO unware. Of 
course, ot be usable, a lot of details needs to be polished, and 
performance evaluated.

Why do you need this "special" fibril for the submission task?

Maybe an arch-specific copy_thread_info()? Or, since there's a 1:1 
relationship, just merging them.

Yes ;) Brutally copying the structure over does not look good IMO. Better 
keep a pointer and swapping them. A clone_per_call() and free_per_call() 
might be needed.

Fine IMO. Better keep scheduling code localized inside schedule().

Eeek, ... poll, epoll :)
That might solve the async() <-> POSIX bridge in the other way around. The 
collector will become the async() events fetcher, instead of the other way 
around. Will work just fine ...

This is the *big win* of the whole thing IMO.

Stack allocation can be optimized/cached, as someone else already said.

This should not be a huge problem IMO. High latency operations like 
network sockets can be handled with standard I/O events interfaces like 
poll/epoll, so I do not expect to have a huge number of fibrils around. 
The number of fibrils will be proportional to the number of active 
connections, not to the total number of connections.

Agreed. Most definitely not worth it, for the reasons above.

That seems the correct policy in any case.

Fibril should IMO use current thread signal policies. I think a signal 
should hit (wake) any TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE fibril, if the current thread 
policies mandate that. I'd keep a list_head of currently scheduled-out 
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE fibrils, and I'd make them runnable when a signal is 
delivered to the thread (wake_target bit #1 set to mean wake-all-interruptable-fibrils?).
The other thing is signal_pending(). The sigpending flag test is not going 
to work as is (cleared at the first do_signal). Setting a bit in each 
fibril would mean walking the whole TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE fibril list. Maybe 
a sequential signal counter in task_struct, matched by one in the fibril. 
A signal would increment the task_struct counter, and a fibril 
schedule-out would save the task_struct counter to the fibril. The 
signal_pending() for a fibril is a compare of the two. Or something 
similar.
In general, I think it'd make sense to have a fibril-based implemenation 
and a kthread-based one, and compare the messyness :) of the two related 
to cons/performnces.
