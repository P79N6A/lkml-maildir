Hi,
In arch/i386/kernel/i387.c:mxcsr_feature_mask_init(), one can read:
	asm volatile("fxsave %0" : : "m" (current->thread.i387.fxsave)); 
But I would rather have written:
	asm("fxsave %0" : "=m" (current->thread.i387.fxsave)); 
Considering the code around, it doesn't do much difference, but it makes
more sense (i.e. we just fill fxsave).
