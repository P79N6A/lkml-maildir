Hmm. That leaves apparently just alpha/ppc/powerpc as supporting pcspkr, 
and *not* doing this. Maybe they should be forced to do the i8253 lock in 
arch code too, and expose it through <asm/i8253.h>, instead of having that 
butt-ugly #ifdef remain in the sources?
Paul, Jay, Ivan: right now drivers/input/pcspkr.c does this:
	#if defined(CONFIG_MIPS) || defined(CONFIG_X86)
	/* Use the global PIT lock ! */
	#include <asm/i8253.h>
	#else
	#include <asm/8253pit.h>
	static DEFINE_SPINLOCK(i8253_lock);
	#endif
and wouldn't it be nice if we just changed it to
	#include <asm/i8253.h>
and got rid of one totally unnecessary stupid arch difference?
