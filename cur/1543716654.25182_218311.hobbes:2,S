I can confirm on my Asus A7N8X Deluxe v2.0 with BIOS 1007 (the latest),
that its reporting
60: 08 00 01 20 20 00 88 80 10 00 00 00 01 ff 0f 9f
So, it looks like it needs the new value as per the note.
I haven't applied that patch that was posted yesterday, am awaiting more
reaction from Len, Ross and all.
