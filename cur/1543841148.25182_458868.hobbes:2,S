It is pretty weird that permission bits on vfat can magically change in
response to memory pressure.
But no, I'm not really advocating any changes in this area - I don't recall
any complaints (surprised) and the chances are that if we changed it
(ie: not permit the inode to accept changes which cannot be stored on disk)
then someone's app would break.
otoh, it is pretty bad behaviour...
