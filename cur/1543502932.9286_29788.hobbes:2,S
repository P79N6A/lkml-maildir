Had a problem today, I don't know if it's hardware related or not.
This machine has 2 adaptec aha2940U cards.  I have 2 of the exact cdroms. 
One on each controller. (0:4:0 and 1:5:0 are the ids).
I started ripping an audio cd on 0:4:0 and forgot the id of the 2nd one so I
did a cdrecord -scanbus.  It showed me all the devices on scsi0, but as soon
as it printed scsi1, the system froze solid.  alt-sysrq-b didn't reboot the
machine.
The machine is a dual p233mmx /w 256mb of ram, 8 scsi hard drives (4
(2 x 2g, 2x 1.7g all micropolis) on scsi0 and 4 (9.1g quantum, 3x 2g
micropolis) on scsi1), the 2 meantioned scsi cdroms, a 2x6 scsi burner, and
a 4gb (dds2) scsi tape.
