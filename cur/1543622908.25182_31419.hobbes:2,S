Let's see, the choices are to (a) keep the old scheduler which has many
performance issues, or (b) put in the new scheduler and let people who
need the old drivers either fix them or stop upgrading.
Bad performance should go the way of a.out kernels and xiafs (which at
least did have utility), not be justified as a way to force people to
patch their kernel.
