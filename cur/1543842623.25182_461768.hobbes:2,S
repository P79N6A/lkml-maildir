The revamped version is much simpler than the previous ones. We are
basically back to the early ones we had in 2.6.17-mm5, with a tiny
modification to fix the oops that was reported there.
AFAIK, the possible problems that my patches might generate should only be:
* an obvious bug in the code leading to an oops during pci_enable_msi()
or pci_enable_msix() ;
* a wrong detection of whether MSI are supported or not, leading to MSI
being disabled while supported (should not be bad for most drivers), or
enabled while unsupported by the root chipset (would be bad).
Do we have Brandon lspci so that I can see if any of the MSI quirks is
involved?
