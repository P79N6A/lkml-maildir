Andrew,
The following patch seems to be breaking my ia64 sn2_defconfig
build of 2.6.16-rc1-mm5:
    gregkh-pci-altix-msi-support-git-ia64-fix.patch
I'm guessing you should remove it for now.
Details:
========
When I try to build an ia64 sn2_defconfig 2.6.16-rc1-mm5, the
build fails:
    arch/ia64/sn/pci/tioce_provider.c:699:49: macro "ATE_MAKE" passed 3 arguments, but takes just 2
    arch/ia64/sn/pci/tioce_provider.c: In function `tioce_reserve_m32':
    arch/ia64/sn/pci/tioce_provider.c:699: error: `ATE_MAKE' undeclared (first use in this function)
If I remove the patch:
    gregkh-pci-altix-msi-support-git-ia64-fix.patch
then it compiles fine.
It seems that someone added a patchset to change the ATE_MAKE()
macro from 2 to 3 args, then someone added this above fix patch
for a missed change, then someone reverted it all back to 2 args,
but leaving this fix patch.
I guess it means Andrew should remove the above patch.
But I really do not know what is going on here.
