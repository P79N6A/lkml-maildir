OK. Firstly I rebuilt the kernel (2.4.9) with CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO
enabled. I also configured the parallel driver to be a module, to enable
easier testing.
I found that whatever I did, printing was not stalled (this must be a
result of CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO).
However, I found that dmesg gave some strange messages every so often under
PIO and DMA modes.
	FIFO is stuck
	BUSY timeout
	dma write timed out
I don't know what they mean (the printing itself was not affected) but
I guess it would be better to avoid modes which give such messages.
At the moment I am loading the module with:
	insmod parport
	insmod parport_pc io=0x378,0xa800 irq=auto,auto dma=nofifo,nofifo
If there is anything more I should be doing, please let me know.
Thanks for all the help,
