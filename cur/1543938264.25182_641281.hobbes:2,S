Odd, I couldn't reproduce it Friday and could today. Clearly I was not
firing on all cylinders. The problem was because NUMA && FLATMEM are
incompatible. Thanks for nudging a second time.
However in the patch below addressing the problem below, would it make more
sense to replace X86_PC with !NUMA instead of having X86_PC && !NUMA?

Subject: Do not allow FLATMEM && NUMA to be set on x86 at the same time
The FLATMEM memory model references a global mem_map and max_mapnr. This
is incompatible with how memory models used for NUMA view the world.
Builds fail if FLATMEM && NUMA are set on x86. This patch forbids that
combination of config items. This is consistent with x86_64
enforcements.
