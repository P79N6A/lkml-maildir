And I am assuming that vserv is implemented as a container, hence this
is an example of nested containers very likely to be used.  But given
what I now think is your definition of nested, I think we are agreed.

Alas, the spacing on the picture didn't quite work out :)  I think that
by nested containers, you mean overlapping nested containers.  In your
example, how are you suggesting that cont1 refers to items in
container1.1.2's shmem?  I assume, given your previous posts on openvz,
that you want every shmem id in all namespaces "nested" under cont1 to
be unique, and for cont1 to refer to any item in container1.1.2's
namespace just as it would any of cont1's own shmem?
In that case I am not sure of the actual usefulness.  Someone with
different use for containers (you? :)  will need to justify it.  For me,
pure isolation works just fine.  Clearly it will be most useful if we
want fine-grained administration, from parent namespaces, of the items
in a child namespace.
