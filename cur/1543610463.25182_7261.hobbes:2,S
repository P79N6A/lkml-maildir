Subject: Sparc64 Compiles OK, but won't boot new kernel

Hi,
I have been able to successfully compile the 2.4.14 and 2.4.15 kernels
for Sparc64 but each gives me an error on boot-up:
Image to large for Destination  (twice)
It then kicks me back to the silo prompt.  My kernel is trimmed back
quite a bit and there isn't a lot there.  
It's not a compressed kernel -- should it be?  How do I do that since
the bzImage make is missing from the Sparc64 makefiles?
I am using Redhat 6.2 on an Enterprise 4000, 4 Ultrasparc-II CPU's and
2Gb of Ram.
Any suggestions??
Norm
