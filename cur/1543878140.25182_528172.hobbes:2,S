Probably it is I who missed something :)
But why can't we do both changes? I think it is just ugly to use init to
reap the kernel thread. Ok, wait4() can find zombie quickly if we do the
->children split. But /sbin/init could be swapped out, we still need to
deliver SIGCHLD, etc.
And I personally agree with Linus, it is nice to hide the kernel threads
from /sbin/init (or whatever) completely.
No?
Oleg.
