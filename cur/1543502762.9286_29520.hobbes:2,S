as i wrote earlier, i do not know to reproduce it.
but i'm going to install this pre-patch (and maybe 2.2.11 etc.) and if
error do not occurs in about 2 months from now, we can consider it fixed.
it's not very plesant idea but it's also not very plesant bug (or
misconfiguration?).
thanks for help.
sincerely
