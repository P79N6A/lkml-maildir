Then the tgid stat sending on exit will need to be turned on for everyone.

It can choose not to, by not inserting its "fill my fields" function 
inside the do..while_each_thread
loop within fill_tgid. So while they would still necessarily receive the 
per-tgid taskstats struct on exit
(because some other subsystem needs it), they can atleast save on 
filling up their part of the struct
if they don't need it.

Yes, thats what will have to be done. If one user wants, all users will 
need to get the stats. They can
limit their impact by not processing the parts of the netlink message 
that correspond to the per-tgid stats
(since the per-tgid stats are sent as a separate attribute, thats easy 
to do).
This patch covers the use case where someone like CSA is the only user 
(delay accounting is turned off)
and wants to reduce the performance impact of the kernel allocating, 
sending and userspace discarding
the per-tgid stats.

Yes, its a performance optimization.

No :-(
Will try to get some numbers.
Jay/Chris, if you can try to do that too, for the kind of usage that is 
typical of CSA,
that would be great.
