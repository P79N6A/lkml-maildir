Any "customer" using a security model other than provided by their Linux
distributor instantly voided all support from that distro by doing that.
So, since the support is gone, they can easily build their own kernels,
with their own LSM interfaces, and get the exact same lack of support :)
And, what are these "other LSM modules" you speak of that people rely on
to run their businesses?

Wait, what?
Since when does Sarbanes-Oxley decree that a company must use a
"standard kernel"?  And just exactly what defines such "standard
kernel"?  Can you point out where in that bill it requires such a thing?
Totally confused,
