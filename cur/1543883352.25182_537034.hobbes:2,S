Hi all,
today, with 2.6.21, my laptop had a really odd behaviour. It started 
writing to disk for a few minutes with no interactivity at all (no 
redraw on screen, only hdd led on). It's the first time i noticed 
OOM-killer started do kill programs.
It was totally unresponsive for minutes, after back to life it had a 
load of ~19.0, and 300+ MB on swap (first time i saw this).
It's an HP pavillon core duo 2.0 GHz, 1 GB RAM
