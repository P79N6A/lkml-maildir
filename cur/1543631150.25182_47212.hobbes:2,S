Sadly, l-k is notorious for flames...  expect a flame for just about 
_any_ post to this list.
You might want to try the kernel-newbies list first with questions... 
that list seems less prone to roasting people with near-routine 
questions.  The address for that list is kernelnewbies@nl.linux.org. 
(And yes, accessing a file from the kernel is a fairly routine question 
around here.  Which is part of the reason the first response was a bit 
curt.)
And the footer of a message from the kernel-newbies list has some other 
things you might find helpful:
Kernelnewbies: Help each other learn about the Linux kernel.
