The SCSI layer submits stuff to libata inside spin_lock_irqsave(), and 
from there we DMA-map and send straight to hardware.
So, changing the hot path to permit sleeping would be difficult and add 
needless complexity, IMO.
I would rather pay the penalty of resubmitting if the 
map-inside-spinlock fails, than to slow down the hot path.
