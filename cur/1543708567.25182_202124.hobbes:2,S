It is a misleading error message, I'll look into correcting that.

The filesystem typically shuts down on detection of corruption,
so you should get just the one error report.

No, not all filesystem behave this way.  And it is configurable
in XFS; if you don't want this to happen, you can switch it off
via the sysctl/procfs interface - see the "error_level" section
in Documentation/filesystems/xfs.txt.
