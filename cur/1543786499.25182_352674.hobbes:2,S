Noone bothered defining it, but most everyone is happy about it being
as it is.  Non-journalling filesystems would have severe corruption on
unclean umounts.  lost+found would fill up much faster than people are
used to, if 4-6 was common for hard disks.
Journalling filesystems actually would be robust against 4-6, as long
as their block size was large enough.  The journal must contain the
complete erase block from flash - which is commonly in the area of 64k
or 128k.  Ext3 blocks are much smaller, so the fs would still corrupt.
Well - DataFlash appears to have very small block sizes.  So yes, it
would be possible to use ext3 on it.  But then there's still the
problem of limited per-block flash lifetime and ext3 doesn't do wear
levelling.
