Sorry that this came out wrong.  kernel-doc provides structure, but it can't 
provide content.  And authors seem unable to think from the POV of someone 
*using* the API.
With some work, I tracked it back to Stephen Hemminger for this comment in 
12d9c8420b9daa1da3d9e090640fb24bcd0deba2.  It's since been fixed and moved,
but it's still:
 * __fls: find last set bit in word
 * @word: The word to search
 *
 * Undefined if no set bit exists, so code should check against 0 first.
Which would be *fine* if fls() didn't have such confusing bit numbering and 
the exact same one-line description.
Thanks,
Rusty.
