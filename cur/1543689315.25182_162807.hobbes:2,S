IMO... even though you do lose a tiny bit of performance, I definitely
prefer the save/restore versions.
It allows the arch a lot more flexibility, so I even have a [weak]
argument that {save,restore} variants increase portability.  And it's
safer, as I like to avoid code which winds up doing (as it passes
through layers) spin_unlock_irq() followed by spin_unlock_irqrestore().
