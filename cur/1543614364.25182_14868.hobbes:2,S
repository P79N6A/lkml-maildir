I don't see this.   With egcs-1.1.2 and assembler 2.11.90.0.25,
your patch actually (and mysteriously) shrunk the kernel by 500
bytes - the new .text is a little smaller than the sum of the
old .text and .text.lock.
As you say, if the assembler is generating long-form branches for
the `jle' in the below sequence, we have a problem.
#APP
1:      lock ; decb timerlist_lock
        js 2f
.subsection 1
.ifndef .text.lock.bust_spinlocks
.text.lock.bust_spinlocks:
.endif
2:      cmpb $0,timerlist_lock
        rep;nop
        jle 2b
        jmp 1b
.previous
Keith, perhaps you could ship a .s file and a version number to HJ?
