"How do I disable core dumps?" - "mkdir core; chmod 000 core"
was a common FAQ over here when we had HPSUX 9 machines (with no
ulimit for core dumps).
Another point: if something goes belly up in /usr/src/linux/net, it
most probably is cc1 and the reason is a hardware flaw. That's also
one reason why the Makefile tries to remove every core file.
