	Hmm, I think the first idea works better, have a /dev with actual
files on it which have permissions and whatnot, all in ext2.  Then when devfs
starts up, if /dev exists, it reads it and uses it for permissions.  Hmm, I'd
actually suggest saying that it also shows the devices in /dev even if it
doesn't find them in the system.  If it does find them, it should have some
way of matching them up, catch my drift?  Or at least working around them.
	Something where, you have /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s0, then you add a new
controller in a different PCI slot, and take out the first one, well, if
possible it'd be kind of nice to have the new controller come up as
/dev/dsk/c1t0d0s0.  I'm just thinking here, so this might not be the best
idea.
	Hmm, perhaps a /devices that is set up based off of (as best it
can figure it out) hardware information, whereby you have it be this UnionFS
with the permissions and whatnot stored in the background, and then you have
a userspace tool that scans through /devices (When you run it, not 
automagically) and creates symlinks in /dev to things in /devices?  Though
it is carefull to never delete symlinks, that should be a manual operation.
(Or at least a seperate one).
	Then you have daemons for hot-swap devices that can create symlinks
to newly created things in /devices.  Again, brain storming, so perhaps this
is uglier than it should be...

	It may, not TOO familiar w/ how quotas work exactly.
