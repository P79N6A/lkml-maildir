Ah I know what the problem is. I already fixed it in CVS two weeks ago, but 
the merge with marcelo was in the brokenness window and I forgot about
it because of the long delay (the patch got only applied three weeks
later or so)
Just copy arch/x86_64/lib/copy_user.S from an 2.4.20 kernel or revert the 
changes in  that file in 2.4.21-rc1, that should fix it.
Thanks for testing,
-Andi
