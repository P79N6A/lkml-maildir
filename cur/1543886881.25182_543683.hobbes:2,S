Thank you very much for looking at this, Len.

Yes, the device is using MSI.

Agreed, although I had one user back in March report APIC errors on the
Asus M2V board while running Debian x86_64.  I personally have never
encountered the problem under a 64-bit kernel, but I admit that just
might be random luck.

This is a PCIe LAN-on-motherboard.
My goal is to understand whether this is a problem in the atl1 driver,
or a problem on the motherboard.  If it's the former, obviously I want
to fix it.  If it's the latter, then I want to disable MSI in the driver
when we discover we're running on this motherboard.
Thanks again for taking time to look at this.  Any advice or hints you
provide will be greatly appreciated.
