It is a kernel thread which is used for making calls out to userspace
applications from within the kernel.

Strange.  I assume that what's happening is that the children of khelper
are being created and are dying, and init is somehow seeing this happen. 
Maybe SIGCHLD, probably via wait4().  Perhaps init should be changed to not
complain about processes which it did't parent.  But then, that should
already be the case.
Could you please apply the below debug patch, then send us all the relevant
syslog output, including the messages from init?
Thanks.
