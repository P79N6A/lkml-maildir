Hi,
I tried your .config, and I can't reproduce the problem.
(No errors in i2o and no errors in smbfs). This means that something 
is terribly wrong, either in your setup (or mine, but it compiles for me
:-), or there is some weird missing dependency in the MODVERSIONS code.
Could you try a "make mrproper" before compiling (remember to save your
.config)?
Greetings,
