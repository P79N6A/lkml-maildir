BSD is wrong for not choosing a different name
for the new system call and leaving the old one.
There could have been a signal2() with the new
behavior. X/Open even did this, with bsd_signal()
as the name. Breaking compatibility is bad.

Non-default behavior is nearly irrelevant. The default
should have matched traditional UNIX and Linux behavior.
The best of both worlds certainly means traditional
signal() and a bsd_signal(), with a non-default option
to choose the BSD signal() behavior.
