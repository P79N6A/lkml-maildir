Hello,
I have just compiled and booted 2.2.3. I can confirm that I am still able
to _totally_ (no sysrq) freeze my machine by running the kdm
(XF86_FBDEV/kde) _while_ playing a wav file.
Since I can reliably repeat this crash, I can try to debug the problem.
Andrea can you give me a pointer to the kernel debugger patch ? May be it
is of some help.
Ciao,
	Riccardo.
