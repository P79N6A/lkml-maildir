I think you're jumping to conclusions about what causes this - let's
actually try to find the real root cause. These things have many different 
causes ... for instance, rmap has been found to be a problem in some 
workloads (especially things like the fork stuff). If you want to 
try 65-mjb1 with and without the the shared pagetable stuff, you
may get some different results. (if you have stability problems, try
doing a patch -p1 -R of 400-shpte, it seems a little fragile right now).

Also, if you can get kernel profiles for each test, that'd help to work
out the root cause.
