Never mind.  That was a bad suggestion.  I do think it would be a good
idea to mark the 'struct page' of ever page we use as bootmem in some
way.  Perhaps page->private?  Otherwise, you can simply try all of the
possibilities and consider the remainder bootmem.  Did you ever find out
if we properly initialize the bootmem 'struct page's?
Please have mercy and put this in a helper, first of all.
static void free_usemap(unsigned long *usemap)
{
	if (!usemap_
		return;
	if (PageSlab(virt_to_page(usemap))) {
		kfree(usemap)
	} else if (is_vmalloc_addr(usemap)) {
		vfree(usemap);
	} else {
		int nid = page_to_nid(virt_to_page(usemap));
		bootmem_fun_here(NODE_DATA(nid), usemap);
	}
}
right?

How is this any different from pfn_to_nid() on the thing?  Or, can you
not use that because we never init'd the bootmem 'struct page's?
If so, I think the *CORRECT* fix is to give the bootmem areas real
struct pages, probably at boot-time.
