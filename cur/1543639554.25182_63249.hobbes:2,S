In which case you might as well do the rest of the world a favour and
restrict US usage of Linux in the license file while you are at it.
Unfortunately the USA forces people to deal with this crap. I'd hope SGI
would be decent enough to explicitly state they will license this stuff
freely for GPL use (although having shipping Linux themselves the
question is partly moot as the GPL says they can't impose additional
restrictions)
