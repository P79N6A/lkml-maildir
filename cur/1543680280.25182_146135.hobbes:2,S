IIRC, Al vetoed the NFS cto change that went into 2.4.x because he
claimed he was planning on providing an alternative fix that would
better fit the unionfs.
As that apparently won't materialize in 2.6.x, I'm in any case
planning on presenting the open(".") patch (or some variant of it) to
Linus.
That said, just backing a bugfix out of a stable kernel without
providing an alternative solution should only be done in those cases
where keeping it would cause a worse problem. For instance if the fix
is a security issue...
Cheers,
  Trond
