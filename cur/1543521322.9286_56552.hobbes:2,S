Hi,
Looking through the various implementations of mmap2(), it occurs that
at least the sparc implementation is byggy.
Sparc's mmap2() consists of:
        /* Make sure the shift for mmap2 is constant (12), no matter what PAGE_SIZE
           we have. */
        return do_mmap2(addr, len, prot, flags, fd, pgoff >> (PAGE_SHIFT - 12));
What happens if you have an 8K page size (PAGE_SHIFT == 13), and the
user supplies an odd number in pgoff?
You are unable to represent the requested offset into the do_mmap2()
call.  Surely, in this case, mmap2() should return EINVAL.
I haven't looked at all the architectures, but I know that ARM was
more buggy than this before tonight. ;)
