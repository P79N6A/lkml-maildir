Cool. According to my thinking, madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) even in today's
kernels using down_write(mmap_sem) for MADV_DONTNEED is better than
mmap/mprotect, which have more fundamental locking requirements, more
overhead and no benefits (except debugging, I suppose).
MADV_DONTNEED is twice as fast in single threaded performance, and an
order of magnitude faster for multiple threads, when MADV_DONTNEED only
takes mmap_sem for read.
Do you plan to include this change in general glibc releases? Maybe it
will make google malloc obsolete? ;) (I don't suppose you'd be able to
get any tests done, Andrew?)
