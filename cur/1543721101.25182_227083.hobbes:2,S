You could try kmsgdump, which Randy Dunlap ported to 2.6 :
   
http://developer.odsl.org/rddunlap/kmsgdump/
Upon panic, it switches real mode, uses the bios to change display to text
mode (which does not work for every video card, but still most of them),
then put you in an interactive screen in which you can scroll the last
32 kB of kernel messages, then decide to dump them on a floppy disk or
print them on a parallel printer. This can also be configured to dump
automatically without user interaction and automatically reboot once
done.
Clearly what you need it seems,
Willy
