Is the end_io field from the kiobuf structure still used?
The only usage of it that I can find is in fs/iobuf.c:end_kio_request().
	if (kiobuf->end_io)
		kiobuf->end_io(kiobuf);
I can't find code in the kernel that sets the end_io field.  The kiobuf
structure should be hidden from drivers, so a driver shouldn't be
setting it.  The callback routines for the IO are set in the individual
buffer headers.  So far it looks like this check in end_kio_request()
always does nothing because the end_io field is initialized as 0.
Am I missing something?
Thanks,
Andrew
