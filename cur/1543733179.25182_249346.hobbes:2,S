msync(p, sz, MS_ASYNC) only does set_page_dirty() at the moment and
returns 0 unconditionally AFAICT, so things are stuck blocking and
waiting for disk to reap the status of the IO at all. Maybe if that
worked the fault handling wouldn't be as important. Maybe we should be
reaping AS_EIO and/or AS_ENOSPC in the MS_ASYNC case, or wherever it is
we stash the fact those IO errors ever happened. I'm also not sure what
people think would be the right way to kick off IO in the background
there, as trying to kmalloc() a workqueue element, then doing
schedule_work() on it has resource management issues, but forcing
userspace to block on the IO to ensure it's been initiated at all
defeats the point of it.

I believe SIGBUS is conventional, though you seem to be leaning toward
solutions outside the fault path. I presume the "You're screwed without
msync(2)" bit is standards-conformant.
