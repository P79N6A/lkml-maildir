I did a freetext search of the LXR for 'remap' and came up with this function:
820 /*
821  * maps a range of physical memory into the requested pages. the old
822  * mappings are removed. any references to nonexistent pages results
823  * in null mappings (currently treated as "copy-on-access")
824  */
825 static inline void remap_pte_range(pte_t * pte, unsigned long address, 
unsigned long size,
826         unsigned long phys_addr, pgprot_t prot)
This looks promising, although it's a bit ambiguous to me.  Treating the 
physical pages as distinct from virtual pages:
[1] maps a range of physical memory onto the requested pages
I assume 'the requested pages' here refer to 'the specified virtual pages', 
since the statement makes no sense if it's referring to 'the specified physical 
pages'.
[2] the old mappings are removed.
Looking at the source, it seems that this means 'if these virtual pages were 
pointed to any physical pages before, they won't be anymore'
[3] any references to nonexistent pages results in null mappings ('copy-on-access')
I have no idea what this means, and I can't figure it out reading the code.
Obviously it refers to something not really being there (thus 'nonexistent'). So 
copy-on-access? How do you copy something that doesn't exist?
