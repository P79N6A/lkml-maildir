Please don't until all the framebuffer drivers are able to deal with
suspend and resume (which will also require some mechanism to switch
backlights back on). Currently, it's far easier to restore some amount
of state on a standard VGA or VESA mode. There's no real support for
doing so with most accelerated framebuffers.
