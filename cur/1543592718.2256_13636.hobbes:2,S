I found some references to bzdisk breaking in 2.3.28, followed by a fix.
Checking /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S, the fix has remained
and has not been lost. See:
http://web.gnu.walfield.org/mail-archive/linux-kernel/1999-November/1818.html
However, something else must have changed since then to cause the image
size to go over its maximum. Has bzdisk being abandoned (or at least
ignored)?
