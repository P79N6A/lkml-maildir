Good to know, thanks for testing.

And you are right, this is best a fractional value of the total number
of requests.

Yes, that is right. I have a newer version in my tree, that uses the
complete split pending lists (and nr pending counter) along with
separate wait queues. I'm just doing some testing on it now, to make
sure it is 100% safe. This makes performance even better than the -3
patch here.

Naturally, -3 was never a proposal for inclusion, just a quick test
patch ;-). This is also in my current tree.
