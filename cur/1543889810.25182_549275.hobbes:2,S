Isn't that awful?
By now we should be in the situation where if a tester is hitting a
kernel crash we can say to them "please turn on crashdumps and send me
the image".  But we're not - kernel developers don't know how to turn the
thing on in $RANDOM_DISTRO, testers have no experience with the feature
and kernel developers don't have experience handling the crash images.
And I'm not sure that the (required) "don't dump user memory and pagecache"
feature has been implemented yet?
It'd be in our interests to push all this along a bit.
