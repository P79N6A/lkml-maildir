I just has a test run with a virtual sched_clock and your patch. 
Unfortunately, it doesnt work. top shows 100% for a cpu bound process, but 
steal time shows about 5% stolen cpu.
This brings me to another problem: runtime.
Let me give an example. You get 90% cpu from your hipervisor in a shared 
environment. If you now start a cpu bound task that gets the full cpu for 
lets say 10 minutes. I REALLY want to see 9 minutes in ps and top because my 
department might pay for used cpu cycles.

Well, as I said we started with the same approach (virtual cpu) but we learned 
that these numbers have no meaning at all because the hypervisor does have 
different scheduling timeslices and having 100% inside the guest can still 
result in almost nothing if the system is really loaded.
