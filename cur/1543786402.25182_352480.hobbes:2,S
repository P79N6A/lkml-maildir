That's not really an accurate explanation/understanding of what's going on
in there.
There's an extremely special-case in the pagefault handlers where we fail
the fault if in_atomic().  It's unrelated to spinlocks (spinlocks don't
even cause in_atomic() to become true if !CONFIG_PREEMPT).
It has to do with kmap_atomic().  There's tricksy code in mm/filemap.c
which will fault the target page in by hand and will then take an atomic
kmap and will then raise current->preempt_count by hand, so in_atomic()
becomes true even if !COFNIG_PREEMPT.
So at this stage we expect to be able to do a copy_to/from_user to/from
pagecache without taking a fault, because we just faulted the page in by
hand.  And we're not allowed to take a fault, because we're holding an
atomic kmap.  But if we _do_ take a fault (extreme memory pressure, racing
munmap, etc) then we want to fail the pagefault immediately.
The in_atomic() test in x86's do_page_fault() is in fact a message passed
into it from filemap.c's kmap_atomic().  It has accidental side-effects,
such as making copy_to_user() fail if inside spinlocks when
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y.
So I think this change is only needed if UML implements kmap_atomic, as in
arch/i386/mm/highmem.c, which it surely does not do?
