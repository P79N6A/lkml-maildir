It is not because of the sake of the tools and we have no capable enough 
developers. It's just about an example that came to my mind, as I 
mentioned before and also,it is the same thing as we, all the time, did. 
I mean getting and sharing codes from many different open source 
projects like BSD and countless others. So, OpenSolaris makes no 
difference at this.
