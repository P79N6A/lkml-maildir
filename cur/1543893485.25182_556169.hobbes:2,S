Subject: Can we get rid of zImage this time?

I brought this up a few years ago, and had it shot down, because of a
few poorly substantiated claims of zImage-only machines; those claims
really need to be debugged since they might indicate A20-related failures.
Anyway...
Can we please kill zImage?  In addition to be completely useless for
modern kernels, it causes unnecessary complexity in boot loaders.
