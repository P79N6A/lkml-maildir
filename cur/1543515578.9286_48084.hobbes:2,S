That's a nice thing of the BP6 motherboard, you can change the motherboard 
clock speed with 1 MHz increment (from 66 MHz or 75 MHz onwards, I not sure
exactly which).  One more thing I forgot to add from a separate mail to you
Grobbebol is that the PCI de-couple with motherboard speed at 92 MHz.  I think
we are getting way off topic here :)  We can discuss on more on email if you
like.
