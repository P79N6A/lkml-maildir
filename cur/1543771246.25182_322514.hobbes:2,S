Well, "certainly" is hard to say without the kind of PCI-bus level
logic analyser thing.  Flakey PCI implementations could chew up lots
of bandwidth.  It _should_ not take 8 MB/s bandwidth.  But if it's
chewing up bandwidth, and you're already near the limit in terms
of throughput on that hardware (doesn't need to be at the theoretical
ceiling!) then regular small demands could conceivably chew up more
bandwidth than you'd like.
