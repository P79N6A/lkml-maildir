looking at the source code of xmms and found that xmms OSS output
plugin behaves differently if the process is SCHED_RR.
when xmms is started with SCHED_RR, it won't create an (another) audio
thread.  perhaps this explains also the difference found in some
cases.
well, i'm not 100% sure about this theory, now needs to practice :)
please try to turn off the check of SCHED_RR in
xmms/Output/OSS/audio.c, something like:
        realtime = xmms_check_realtime_priority();
replaced with
	realtime = 0;
