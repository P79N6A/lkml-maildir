cool, we're discussing on jackit-devel if this could be added to jackd's
libjack which would do the gettimeofday calls right before and after
calling the process() callback. This might indeed be very very very very
useful as in this case the clients themselfes wouldn't need to be
changed and jackd might then print a console message for example when a
client does something nasty.
