Ooh you have a vm patch that helps swap on the desktop! I can help you here 
with my experience from swap prefetch.
1. Get it reviewed and have noone show any evidence it harms
2. Find hundreds of users who can testify it helps
3. Find a way of quantifying it.
4. ...
5. Merge into mainline.
There, that should get you as far as 4. 
I haven't figured out what 4 is yet. I believe it may be goto 1;
