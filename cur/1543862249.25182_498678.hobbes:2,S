I agree : this a side-effect I pointed out in my LTTng presentation last
summer at OLS.
Here is a quick idea of the potentially problematic instrumentation points
(i386 example) :
- with the task_rq_lock held (therefore preemption is disabled, so it's not a
  problem)
sched.c wait_task_inactive()
sched.c try_to_wake_up()
sched.c wake_up_new_task()
sched.c sched_migrate_task()
sched.c schedule() after prepare_task_switch call, before context_switch call.
  Surrounded by preempt_disable(), preempt_enable_no_resched(), should be ok.
- IRQs : irq_enter()/irq_exit() calls in do_IRQ makes sure that the
  preempt_count is incremented. irq_enter() is called with interrupts still
  disabled.
kernel/irq/handle.c handle_IRQ_event()
- NMIs : nmi_enter() -> irq_enter() -> add_preempt_count(HARDIRQ_OFFSET) called
  with interrupts still disabled.
  Therefore, preemption is disabled within trace points in do_nmi.
- traps : GPF, do_trap, do_page_fault, do_debug, spurious_interrupt,
  math_emulate.
  It is not uncommon for these trap handlers to reenable interrupts very soon.
  They do not increment the preemption count.
  Therefore, preemption must be expected when these handlers run : we cannot
  rely of the fact that hard IRQs would be disabled to prevent the scheduler
  from running, as markers becomes a new source of scheduler events.
- local_irq_enable()/local_irq_disable() :
  It can call trace_hardirqs_on()/trace_hardirqs_off(). These macros are
  sprinkled in _every_ possible context cited above, from trap handlers to
  preemptible code.
Other contexts or code location are not a problem (process context, softirq).
If we are sure that we expect calls to preempt_schedule() from each of these
contexts, then it's ok to put preempt_enable(). It is important to note that a
marker would then act as a source of scheduler events in code paths where
disabling interrupts is expected to disable the scheduler.
