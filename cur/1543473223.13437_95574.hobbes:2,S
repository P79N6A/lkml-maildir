Can anyone explain to me how the watchdog reset works on a sun running linux?
I am getting them on a piece of non-sun hardware (Meiko dino1) that I'm
trying to get working with linux.  Basically I have made some changes to get
past the custom boot and idprom and have it pretending it's a "sun4m" (which I
think is more or less correct).  We get part way through the boot-up sequence,
to the point where the two CPU's are found, and then get bumped back into the 
monitor with "Watchdog Reset".
Presumably this is a timer tied to a hardware reset line?  If so, where do we
feed the timer new values?
Clue please?  :-)
