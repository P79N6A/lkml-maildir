Thanks. I use outlook and tried many approaches before, but patches always have unexpected line breaks when I attach them as inline text. Anyway, I found a new approach to avoid that. Next time, I will paste patches as inline.

In theory, it's a problem which doesn't exist in fact. The smallest page size on IA64 is 4KB (default is 16KB) and cpumask_scnprintf uses hex format, so one page could store cpumask of (4K-1)*4 cpu. I can't imagine a machine has more than (4K-1)*4 cpu.

I agree with you.
