What you describe is _exactly_ one of the schemes we discussed.   
Maintaining that device state info is cheap.
You will need to consider the arrival rates, so you would sample the
(same way we do in the patch) and maintain the average queue-contrib,
per-device. The elegance required is in deciding the per-device quotas
dynamically incase some devices is not using up its quota.
Another scheme would be to do per-device queues ... soft-irq does a RR
We need to experiment, show some numbers. That code exposes the problem
and gives a less than optimal solution since no per-device state is
maintained.

The dynamic sharing of the per-device quoatas would help.
