I didnt got very clearly what you actually did. But i guess you did faced
some problem to work with work queue ( Bottom half of the handler ) I
suggest you with an example code so that you could try with it and hope your
doubt would get cleared.
/* work queue register and initialize */
static DECLARE_WORK(queue_name,(void *)func_name,func_arq_ptr);
eg :-
static DECLARE_WORK(my_queue,(void *)my_func,NULL);
/* In the Interrupt handler you need to call the bottom half of the function
*/
schedule_work(&my_queue);
/* The function defination is like this */
void my_func(void)
{
       printk(" Hello from kernal land \n");
}
I hope this example will make your code to work for you , for any
clarification please let me know 
thanks
