easy, it doesn't :-)  we don't currently have HFS support, mainly b/c the
only freeware implementations of it (that i'm aware of) are GPL'd, and no
one has been able to devote enough time to it to get a BSD-licensed
version.  although the darwin stuff is now available.  i'm not too sure
how much of it is useful (i haven't looked at it either, tho).
later.
