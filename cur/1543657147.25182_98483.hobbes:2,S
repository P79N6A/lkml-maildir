Hello,
I have:
   bear:/var/cache/apt/archives# mount | grep archives
   beaver:/var/cache/apt/archives on /var/autofs/iucha/archives type nfs (rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,addr=10.10.0.10)
Then:
   bear:/var/cache/apt/archives# ls vim*
   ls: vim*: No such file or directory
   bear:/var/cache/apt/archives# find . -name vim\*
   bear:/var/cache/apt/archives# md5sum vim-gtk_1%3a6.1-266+1_i386.deb
   11a6d8dbfb51688d7ac275562540c327  vim-gtk_1%3a6.1-266+1_i386.deb
   bear:/var/cache/apt/archives# 
Note that /var/cache/apt/archives is a symbolic link to /var/autofs/iucha/archives.
So "ls", "find" cannot find the name for the file, but if I know the
file I can open it just fine.
On the client:
   bear:/var/cache/apt/archives# ls | wc -l
   91
On the server:
   florin@beaver:/var/cache/apt/archives$ ls | wc -l
   441
Server has 2.5.53 with no other patches. For clients I have used both 2.5.53
and 2.4.19 (Debian package).
Cheers,
florin
