Hi, this is per-zone/reclaim support patch set for memory controller (cgroup).
Major changes from previous one is
 -- tested with 2.6.24-rc3-mm1 + ia64/NUMA
 -- applied comments.
I did small test on real NUMA machine.
My machine was ia64/8CPU/2Node NUMA. I tried to complile the kernel under 800M
bytes limit with 32 parallel make. (make -j 32)
 - 2.6.24-rc3-mm1 (+ scsi fix) .... shows soft lock-up.
   before soft lock-up, %sys was almost 100% in several times.
 - 2.6.24-rc3-mm1 (+ scsi fix) + this set .... completed succesfully
   It seems %iowait dominates the total performance.
   (current memory controller has no background reclaim)
Seems this set give us some progress.
(*) I'd like to merge YAMAMOTO-san's background page reclaim for memory
    controller before discussing about the number of performance.
Andrew, could you pick these up to -mm ?
Patch series brief description:
[1/10] ... add scan_global_lru() macro  (clean up)
[2/10] ... nid/zid helper function for cgroup
[3/10] ... introduce per-zone object for memory controller and add
           active/inactive counter.
[4/10] ... calculate mapper_ratio per cgroup (for memory reclaim)
[5/10] ... calculate active/inactive imbalance per cgroup (based on [3])
[6/10] ... remember reclaim priority in memory controller
[7/10] ... calculate the number of pages to be reclaimed per cgroup
[8/10] ... modifies vmscan.c to isolate global-lru-reclaim and
           memory-cgroup-reclaim in obvious manner.
           (this patch uses functions defined in [4 - 7])
[9/10] ... implement per-zone-lru for cgroup (based on [3])
[10/10] ... implement per-zone lru lock for cgroup (based on [3][9])
Any comments are welcome.
Thanks,
