Also, removing CAP_SYS_PTRACE from the capability bounded set does
not close the hole (well, as shown by the exploit) either. It seems
CAP_SYS_PTRACE only closes the case of PTRACE_ATTACH, all other
ptrace()'s work, eg PTRACE_TRACEME -> strace echo foo and the exploit 
works too.
Should CAP_SYS_PTRACE not do as the name suggests and completely 
disallow ptrace()? (not just PTRACE_ATTACH).
