yep you are right.
i had this fixed too at a certain point, there is one subtle issue: under
certain circumstances tasklets re-activate the tasklet softirq(s) from
within the softirq handler, which leads to infinite loops if we just
naively restart softirq handling. This fix is not in the -B0 patch yet.
