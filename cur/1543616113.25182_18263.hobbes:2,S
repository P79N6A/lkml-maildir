On every architecture I'm familiar with. But that's a userland issue. I 
don't believe the kernel cares how userland uses its stacks. 
Change gcc. Recompile world. All should work, assuming your gcc changes are 
bug-free, no one made assumptions about stack layout, no one wrote assembly 
code, etc. [In other words, after 4 months of debugging you might get X 
running again...]

Some architectures have hardware assistance for downward growing stacks. One 
example is 68K. I think x86 does too. OTOH, I don't think PPC does, though I 
haven't read the Green Book recently. 
Actually, if I were to be implementing split-stack, I'd probably have one 
grow upward. Probably the data stack, because some architectures (68K, at 
least) force the address stack to grow downwards. 
Put an unmapped page between the two stacks, and all should be fine.
