I'm looking into this bug, I just finished the first large
dbench test set on 2.4.17-rmap11b with 512 MB RAM, tomorrow
I'll run them with 128 and 32 MB of RAM.
Luckily you have already shown the other recent kernels to
have the same performance, so I only have to do half a day
of testing. I'll try to track down this bug and get it fixed.
regards,
Rik
