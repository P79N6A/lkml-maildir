Use of obsolete (racy) module reference count interface. ie. someone's
upping the reference count with __MOD_INC_USE_COUNT() or
MOD_INC_USE_COUNT(), not "try_module_get()", so we can't tell them
that the module is going away so they couldn't get a reference.
Going through and fixing these up is generally fairly easy.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
