Cool, thanks.  
This is both good, and bad.
The Good: This BIOS call is only used to populate disk_info to get the
          disk geometry, which is only in hd.c, and further this call
          rests on a broken assumption that the both the first and the
          second BIOS disks are IDE, so it should be safe to remove
          the call from setup.S,  And there is another filter in 
           that makes it work.
The Bad: That would take patching the kernel, so on some machines
         older kernels will not work...
I have not setup the x86 pic so it may be worth setting that up and
testing to see if that helps.

I would not be surprised, if that is part of the problem.
Did you have to edit the aic7xxx reboot notifier to get scsi reboots
to work?  The reboot notifier should be what sets the controller up
so it can be reinitialized by Linux later.
I am attempting to figure out where to go with the user space side to 
get a useable, and useful ability to boot new kernels.
Pieces:
1) If loaded from loadlin or a sufficiently buggy BIOS is present
   we need to skip the 16bit BIOS calls already.
2) It is ideal to requery the system BIOS in case there are enhancements
   like the EDD work that make the new kernel more useable.
So my strategy will be:
1) As much as is reasonable fix setup.S to work in strange hostile environments,
   there is a lot to be gained and currently it usually works as is.
2) Query the existing kernel infrastructure and as much as possible
   fill in the table of data wants.  And I will skip to the 32bit entry point,
   with that information.
The second will take a bit more work, but having it as an option looks like
a very healthy thing to have.
