Just so everyone knows what we're talking about, some examples from C99:
33 EXAMPLE 9 Arrays can be initialized to correspond to the elements of an  
enumeration by using designators:
enum { member_one, member_two };
const char *nm[] = {
        [member_two] = "member two",
        [member_one] = "member one",
};
34 EXAMPLE 10 Structure members can be initialized to nonzero values  
without depending on their order:
div_t answer = {
        .quot = 2,
        .rem = -1
};
35 EXAMPLE 11 Designators can be used to provide explicit initialization  
when unadorned initializer lists might be misunderstood:
struct { int a[3], b; }
w[] = {
        [0].a = {1},
        [1].a[0] = 2
};
