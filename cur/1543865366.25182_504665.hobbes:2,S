Do we have any explanation about the weird /proc/interrupts output?
i.e. Multiple MSI irqs being assigned to the same card?
Does /sbin/ifconfig ethN down ; /sbin/ifconfig ethN up have anything to do
with the duplication in /proc/interrupts?
I can't see any way for a pci device that doesn't support msi-x to be assigned
multiple interrupts simultaneously.
I just skimmed through the code and there hasn't been any significant
generic MSI work since 2.6.19.
Did this device really work with MSI enabled in 2.6.19?
