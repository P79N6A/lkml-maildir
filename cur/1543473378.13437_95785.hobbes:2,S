Maximum usable memory without patching the kernel is 960M. If your BIOS does
not report the amount of RAM correctly to your Linux, you have to help it:
append mem=256M to your kernel parameters upon boot (/etc/lilo.conf).

There can be various reasons for this. The most famous one (compiled 2.0.3x
with egcs) is not true for you. 
Can you check whether with your current config, X runs on 2.0.3x?
If yes, look out for a kerneld running in 2.1.xx. It shouldn't as kmod does
 the job now. 
If no, the problem is with your setup. Maybe you have setup your X
 incorrectly. (E.g. Links /usr/X11R6/bin/X and /var/X11/bin/X ...) With new
 XF86 dists, you need to use the Xwrapper, if you want to start X as
 non-root (xinit does it for you, however)
What VGA do you have? Is it correctly setup by your PCI BIOS? Have a look at
/proc/pci (or lspci -v).
Hope this helps.
