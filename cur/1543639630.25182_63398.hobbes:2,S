Does Wine and the BIOS actually want the same? I would believe there
would have to be a small difference. Having Wine and BIOS using the
same memory doesn't sound right to me.
Wine wanting segment 0x40 to point to virtual address 0x400 and BIOS
wanting segment 0x40 to point to physical address 0x400 sounds more
reasonable to me. But physical address 0x400 would be virtual address
0xC0000400 with the default PAGE_OFFSET.
