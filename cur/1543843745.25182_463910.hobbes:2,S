will do. If you consider this for -mm then there's some djprobes noise 
in the patch [djprobes isnt upstream yet] - it's not completely 
sanitized yet. (but it should actually work if applied to upstream - 
kprobes and djprobes are disjunct.) Also, i havent tested with 
CONFIG_KPROBES turned off, etc. I'll do a clean queue.

that portion seems a bit tricky - i think what happens is that the 
pre_handler() sets stuff up for single-stepping, and then we do this 
recursive single-stepping (during which preemption remains disabled), 
and _then_ do we re-enable preemption.
