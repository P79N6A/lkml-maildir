Two things:
1) You don't want to boot with a partition that lives somewhere
outside of the first 1024 cylinders on a disk.  This is sometimes
called the "8.4GB boundary".  Though, I think that your using
EZ-Disk gets you around that.  You might want to make a small
(~50MB) /boot partition at the head of the disk if it's the one
you're booting with.
2) You probably want to use a kernel version 2.2.14 or later.
I recently pruchased a 37.5GB IBM IDE disk for my mp3's (why
waste a SCSI disk on it?), and 2.2.12-20 (RH 6.1 default kernel)
wouldn't work with the disk (a multitude of errors).  A lot of
work went into fixing IDE problems for 2.2.14, and my large
disk works fine for me with 2.2.15pre7 ...
