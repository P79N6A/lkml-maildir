There isn't a switch for that and as near as I can tell, no L2 cache 
on this board, only the L1 in the cpu.  If there is an L2, then 
memtest86 can't find it, and I don't see any chips that look like 
seperate memory.  Memtest86 may not know howto enable it if its an 
nforce2 option.  Whatever cache shown as switchable in the bios, 
turning it off makes a very sick bird out of the machine, like a 
33mhz 386sx?
I've located the bios docs on the Biostar site, and was set to print 
them when it locked up the last time. So I'll restart that project 
shortly.
But it does run with it off and for the short time I left it that way, 
no errors.
