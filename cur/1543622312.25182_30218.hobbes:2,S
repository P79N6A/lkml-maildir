Yes, but actually the bus speeds are never 'wildly off', the realistic
values being somewhere between 25 to 41.5 MHz, and because all the new
mainboards have the FSB tunable with a resolution of a single megahertz,
almost all values in this range are posible. And even quite small
changes make sometimes a huge difference (works or doesn't).
