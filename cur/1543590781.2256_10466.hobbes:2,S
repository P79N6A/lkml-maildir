Yes, I understand that.  You're not reading the derivations correctly.
Let's take an example:
derive MVME147_SCSI from MVME147 & SCSI
This doesn't turn on MVME147_SCSI on every MVME147 board.  It turns
on MVME147_SCSI when both MVME147 *and SCCI* are on.  So to suppress
MVME147_SCSI, one just leaves SCCI off.
All these derived symbols will still be controllable.  The difference
is that instead of being controlled by a low-level hardware-oriented
question they're controlled by a capability or subsystem symbol like
SCSI, NET_ETHERNET, or SERIAL.

I'm in touch with Ray Knight directly and will fix this as he requests.

Does this mean you'll take over maintaining the CML2 rules files
for the m68k port, so I don't have to?  That would be wonderful.
Reasoned objections can change my behavior.  Grunting territorial
challenges at me will not.  You have two options: (1) persuade Linus
that the whole CML2 thing is a bad idea and should be dropped, or (2)
work with me to correct any errors I have made and improve the system.
Growling at me and hoping I go away won't work, not when I've invested
a year's effort in this project.
