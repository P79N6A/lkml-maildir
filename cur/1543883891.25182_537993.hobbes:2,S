Subject: [PATCH] [17/30] x86: Use RDTSCP for synchronous get_cycles if possible
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

RDTSCP is already synchronous and doesn't need an explicit CPUID.
This is a little faster and more importantly avoids VMEXITs on Hypervisors.
Original patch from Joerg Roedel, but reworked by AK
Also includes miscompilation fix by Eric Biederman
