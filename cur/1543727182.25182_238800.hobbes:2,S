I have boot.h in /usr/include/ thats why I did not see it. Running i386 as
you already guessed.
Knowledge of include2 should be restricted to the core kbuild files though,
so I will se if I can come up with something smarter.
That would require splitting CPPFLAGS in two parts and we already have
enough variables...
