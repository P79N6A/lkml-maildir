Yes. If a thread is within kernel space, touching that
filp->f_dentry->d_inode is dangerous.

Check fs/namei.c.
Al Viro is cursing because the logic is too complicated.
fs layout:
/mntpoint
/mntpoint/directory
/mntpoint/directory/file
thread 1:
	rename("/mntpoint/directory/file","/mntpoint/file");
thread 2:
	disable_fd for a fd that points to /mntpoint/directory
It seems that your disable_fd calls
	down(&root->d_inode->i_sem); /mntpoint
	down(&inode->i_sem);		/mntpoint/directory
The problem is that a rename will acquire i_sem for /mntpoint and
/mntpoint/directory as well, but it might to that in a different order
(it relies on the memory ordering, see double_down or triple_down)
	down(&inode->i_sem);
	down(&root->d_inode->i_sem);
--> deadlock.
