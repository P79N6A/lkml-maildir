Actually a meritocracy is an oligarchy ruled by those with 'merit',
a ruling body that consists of a dictator is a *DICTATORSHIP*.  
Since when has a dictator ever been benign?  I hear all this 
libertarian garbage being spouted from the "linux community",
and then have people apparently celebrate the existance of a
dictatorship.
And I don't know if you noticed, but the trains aren't running
on time...

Or perhaps positive feedback to the non-obnoxious...  Whoa,
rather than policing those you don't like with a stick, 
encouraging contribution.  What a unique concept!  So, Linux
rather than being an "open" society, is a new form of
domination and policing.  Yeah.  Sign me up.  I want to 
be a Linus crony so that i can beat up on the 
unenlightened.  Really, i do...
And in terms of negative feedback, the majority of my posts
go unheeded, and the questions unanswered, but I say a few
cusswords, and YES!  Someone read my post!  The negative
feedback is *obviously* working very well!

Well, since you want a flame: Oooh, you have big American 
penis.  I am scared.  My penis is so tiny -- miniscule.

Oh GOD no I don't think it gets me what I want! I was just 
being honest.  To tell you the truth, I don't want anything
except for open discussion, and for people to get off of
arguing stupid points, and really having open discussions.
This all started with me asking what the difference between
a feature and a bug fix is.  Apparently it is an arbitrary
decision that "our benevolent leader" makes from what I've 
seen.
As to people getting mad about me cc'ing their posts to
linux-kernel:  Aren't we supposed to be having an *open*
discussion on the list?  What's so stinking bad in the 
posts, and why is it rude?  Or should we commit everything
we do in the dark?
