We are restoring the entire msi flags register which includes the enable bit,
setting it a second time is gratuitous.
In addition if we are restoring the register when the enable bit is not set.
(because we don't have a mask bit) enabling the msi state is actually
the wrong thing to do.    But I admit that case can only happen after
the additions in my last patch.
