No. The number of "mount" options is complex enough as it is. I don't
see the above as being useful.
If you need the above tweak, you should be able to get round the above
problem by first attempting to force the TCP protocol yourself, and then
retrying using UDP if it fails.
Changing the default r/wsize should normally be unnecessary. You only
want to play with them if you actually see performance problems under
testing and find that you are unable to fix the cause of the packets
being dropped.
Cheers,
