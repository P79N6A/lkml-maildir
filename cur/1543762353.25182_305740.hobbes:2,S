Sorry about that,  I had actually checked a fairly recent bk version
and noticed quite a few changes.  I used that to figure out what I could
do that would apply reasonably to both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels,  and then
forgot about all those new changes and used the older release kernel.
See the new patch.

Both the OCF port that I am working on and Evgeniy Polyakov's acrypto
support devices that could use such an API.  The OCF port has already
has two drivers (hifn and safenet) that are using this and,  depending
on how this pans out,  there will be another for Xscale soon.
Whether or not these users of it end up in the kernel is out of my hands
somewhat :-)
Cheers,
Davidm
