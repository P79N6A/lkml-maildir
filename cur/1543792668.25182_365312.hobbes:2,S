I think it is clearly the case that the design is wrong. The existance
of kgdb shows how putting the complex logic remotely on another system
is not only a lot cleaner and simpler but can also provide more
functionality and higher reliability.
The presence of user mode linux and Xen also provide solutions to the
usual concern about needing two systems, as will future hardware
features.
