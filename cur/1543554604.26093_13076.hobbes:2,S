There is a flaw in the eepro100 driver that apparently doesnt initialise 
something properly. The problem is exasperated by the fact that the 
eepro100 driver doesn handle the buffer problem properly. We've corrected 
it by (effectively) resetting the card (by calling close and then open) 
when the first out of resources event occurs. Its not elegant, but it seems 
to work.
We have identical hardware with dual boot disks (linux and freebsd) and the 
problem only occurs with linux, and it only seems to occur with  linux. Of 
course on the DLE supermicro boards FreeBSD complains about an unsupport 
PHY, so there is no joy in mudville no matter what you do :-)
