i tried to test the dfe-550fx card with the new driver from Donald Becker. the version is "sundance.c:v1.09a 7/16/2002". 
the chip of the d-link card is DL10050B. a DL10050A card work with the v1.02d driver. but there are some problems with the DL10050B one.
the kernel version is 2.4.19pre1.
i run the following commands:
	insmod pci-scan.o
	insmod sundance.o
and it worked. the log is as follows:

then when i run the cmd "ifconfig eth2 192.168.0.10"  to bring the card to work,it failed. the problem is as follows,
	sh-2.03# ifconfig eth2 192.168.0.10
	SIOCSIFFLAGS: No such device
and there is no log for this.  so is there some problem on the support of DL10050B? 
please cc. thanks.
