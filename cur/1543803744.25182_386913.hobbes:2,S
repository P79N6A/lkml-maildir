It's pretty sad to go and make something like this a config option.  But
given that it is, believe it or not, an exported-to-userspace interface, I
guess there's not much choice.
The patch is a desirable change (I do get seasick reading x86_64 traces,
but I'll get over it), but it'll cause various bits of downstream grief.
