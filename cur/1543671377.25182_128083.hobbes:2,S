I recently upgraded to RedHat 9.0 only to find that my 600GB RAID system no
longer works.  It worked fine with RH 8.0, however once I upgraded, it no
longer came up cleanly and I got lots of error messages during boot.
I contacted RedHat and they said to try a fresh install, which I did-and got
the same thing.   Currently I am running RH 9.0 with the 2.4.20-9 kernel.
I read through the list archives regarding other's problems with 3ware, and
while at first it sounded like the same problems I am having, when I went to
the Western Digital site to download the firmware (as suggested in the
post), I found that it was only for 180GB and 200GB drives.  All my drives
in my RAID array are 120GB.
The western digital firmware upgrade page is here:

The kernel thread I am referring to is here:

Any ideas?  My system worked fine with RH8 and there have been no hardware
changes.  I checked the ARRAY's integrity with the 3ware tools and it
reported ok.
Here's a snipit of my boot log regarding the 3ware controller (there should
be only one big partition (sda1)

I have A LOT of stuff on there I need to get to, if anyone has any advice on
how to get it working again, please let me know.  I did try to go back to
RH8, but it just sat there after I select "no I don't want to initialize
/sda1 and destroy all data).
Thanks.
