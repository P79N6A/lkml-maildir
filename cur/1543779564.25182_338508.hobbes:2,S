Horms-
Thank you for the effort of trying to get this into 2.4, but I don't 
think there is any support at all for cx88 cards in kernel 2.4 v4l.  I 
wasn't involved in v4l back then, but I took a look at Marcelo's 
linux-2.4.git/tree , and /drivers/media/video/cx88* just doesn't exist.  
There is no cx88-video.c file present for this patch to be applied to!
This one-line fix does make a very big difference, but unfortunately, it 
looks like 2.4 doesn't have the cx88 driver for the fixing...
Good to see that debian has backported it to their 2.6.8 kernel, 
though.  That really makes me smile.  :-)
