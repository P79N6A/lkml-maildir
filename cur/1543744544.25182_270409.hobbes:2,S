sounds good, I can do that.
on a related note, there are a couple of flags that I'm not 100% clear
on the difference between, mainly:
VM_LOCKED
PG_locked
PG_reserved
everything I've seen in the past has suggested that drivers set the
PG_reserved flag for memory allocations intended to be locked down in
memory for extensive dma (the bttv driver had always been pointed to
as an example of that).
I'm not clear how that differs from PG_locked and VM_LOCKED. is
PG_reserved still the suggested way to properly lock memory down, or
is there a more generally accepted method?
Thanks,
Terence
