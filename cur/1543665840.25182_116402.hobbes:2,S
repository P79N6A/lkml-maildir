Any change in the order of dentries returned is likely to run into problem
when seeking in a directory. Given that readdir() is usully followed by
either zero or many stat()s, perhaps when the first stat() comes along you
could pre-read the inodes in optimal order and cace them. However you
tuned the size of your sort should work exactly as well as the size of the
pre-read.
This seems consistent with readahead and AS disk io.
