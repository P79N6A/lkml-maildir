Either the older versions of Linux are totally broken WRT the spec, or
the spec totally broke compatibility. Either way I guess you would be
crazy to depend on that :(

I must have missed the post where you enumerated all said applications
when changing from 2.4 and 2.5.67 behaviour to current.

2.4 semantics, actually. I have an example of a _regression_.

But it is so. Why did you change 2.0 semantics so much? Obviously because
it was broken WRT the spec - I can tell you right now there could have been
a whole lot of applications that preferred the semantics of just throwing
out the data because it is faster, so it wasn't that.
If you want to prove me wrong by quoting buggy behaviour from a 7 year old
kernel.... how am I supposed to argue with that?

Sounds like someone else must have screamed in 2.0 because it was buggy
and the behaviour was changed to match standards for 2.4 and AFAIKS 2.2 does
the same (although I'm not so good at reading 2.2 source).
So those people who didn't like it must have been screaming for a long long
time until it was finally changed in 2.5.68. Unfortunately we have someone
else screaming now (and two years ago) because of the most recent change.

They may sound sane to you but if you go throwing away the dirty bit
against then standards then it is very broken.

It seems very obvious to me that it is a hint. If you wer expecting
to call msync(MS_SYNC) at some point, then you could hope that hinting
with msync(MS_ASYNC) at some point earlier might improve its efficiency.
