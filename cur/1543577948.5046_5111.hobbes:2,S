As I just mentioned, I haven't been able to test this yet due to my
current binary being linked against an older libc with doesn't seem to
have these parameters.  But here's one other data point, I just thought
I'd ask if this jives with your theory:  if I configure the linux kernel
to be able to use 2GB of RAM, then the 870MB limit becomes much lower, to
230MB.
Cheers, Wayne
