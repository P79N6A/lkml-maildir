I would still like to see "MODALIAS=platform:<string>" exported by the
bus, and matching aliases the modules, just like every other subsystem
does.
Like SCSI, with the "artificial" aliases for the modules it wants to
autoload:
  $ /sbin/modinfo sd_mod
  ...
  alias:          scsi:t-0x0e*
  alias:          scsi:t-0x07*
  alias:          scsi:t-0x00*
  ...
  $ cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2/host0/target0:0:0/0:0:0:0/modalias
  scsi:t-0x00
That way you would get full control over the loading or blacklisting
with module-init-tools config files, which doesn't work with direct
module name requests, and no magic in the bus code or the drivers would
be needed.
