The document looks good, but whether:

is a legitimate use case for volatile is still not clear to me (I
agree with Alan's
comment in a previous thread that this seems to be a case where a memory
barrier would be applicable^Wbetter, actually). I could be wrong here, so
would be nice if Peter explains why volatile is legitimate here.
Otherwise, it's fine with me.
