So what's actually wrong with the gazel driver? I'm not an user or
author of it.
When it's the use of old APIs, I indeed think that __deprecated is
exactly what we want. If a driver is superseded by a different one (OSS
vs. ALSA, eepro100 vs e100, ...), sticking a #warning or #error right
into the driver (and not into an included header file) looks quite right
to me.
