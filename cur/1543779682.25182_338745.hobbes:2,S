Please note that ARM already has dyn-tick merged in mainline.  If
we're going to be adding dyn-tick for x86, please do it in a way
that we don't create another goddamned awful mess like we did for
the ARM IRQ stuff.
I notice that this version does some things in a different way to
the ARM version - for instance, it doesn't pass the "number of
jiffies to skip" to the arch reprogram function.
