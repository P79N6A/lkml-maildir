Well, that doesn't necessarily make the idea itself completely crap just  
because the standard implementation is.
Sure, calling a variable "I point to a char! And by the way, I'm named  
Fritz" may be a bad idea, but in some situations it may well make sense to  
say that a certain variable is a container and another is a lock.
And it seems that sometimes, the kernel does just that. (pagecache_lock,  
page_list, just picking two fast examples from 2.4.0 mm)
But lpfilename is, indeed, fucking insane.
