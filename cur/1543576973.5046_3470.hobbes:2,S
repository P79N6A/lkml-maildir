OK ignore the above.... putting it in agpsupport doesn't fix it.
My kernel tree went a bit T-zone after I did that.  Even removing the
fix totally generated
a completely working module!  I had to 'make distclean' to restore the
old (buggy) behaviour.
Possibly something in the auto-dependencies?  Unfortunately I don't have
the info files for gcc so
I can't work out why the '-include' directive would be
overridden/ignored.
