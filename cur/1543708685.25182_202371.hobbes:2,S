Once again (as I previously mentioned in
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0402.3/0442.html
) the
problem is that on alpha CONFIG_ISA is set (to y), but isa_virt_to_bus,
isa_page_to_bus, isa_bus_to_virt are not defined, which results in the
following unresolved symbols:
*** Warning: "isa_virt_to_bus" [drivers/scsi/wd7000.ko] undefined!
*** Warning: "isa_page_to_bus" [drivers/scsi/wd7000.ko] undefined!
*** Warning: "isa_bus_to_virt" [drivers/scsi/wd7000.ko] undefined!

After some investigation (comparing changes in include/asm-i386/io.h,
drivers/scsi/wd7000.c and code in include/asm-alpha/io.h with probably
missing changes) I see that previous proposal was probably incorrect,
and this one should be better...
isa_virt_to_bus and isa_bus_to_virt defines are based on changes for
i386 (where virt_to_bus and bus_to_virt defines have been basically
renamed to isa_virt_to_bus and isa_bus_to_virt - the only difference
is that on alpha virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt and virt_to_phys/phys_to_virt
are not 1:1).
Unlike on i386, on alpha there was no page_to_bus - but I see that it's
something like phys_to_bus(page_to_phys) - so I wrote one basing on
virt_to_bus().
But I'm still not sure - are these changes correct?
