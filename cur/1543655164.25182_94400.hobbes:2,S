Subject: [PATCH]  Make `hash_long' function work if bits parameter is 0.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/12/6/37

If the bits parameter of hash_long (in <linux/hash.h>) is 0, then it
ends up right-shifting by BITS_PER_LONG, which is undefined in C (and
often is a nop).
This patch just handles that case explicitly.
