Hi Li,
we have been discussing this with Marcel previously, and the decission was 
to let the hidp code where it is right now, due to it being very closely 
connected to the bluetooth network stack.

I didn't have time yet to review the patch you sent previously, but I 
don't still quite understand why does the transport layer matter here? The 
generic HID layer, as it is in kernel now, makes an abstraction in a way 
that the HID-specific drivers should not care about the underlying 
transport layer.

That's quite unfortunate. I'll try to review it nevertheless, but it'd be 
much more convenient if you manage to send a patch.
Thanks,
