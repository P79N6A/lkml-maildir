It doesn't matter to me, but I don't see the benefit to doing that.  It's
rather unlike what initramfs is used for now and would need a bunch of
extra code to accomplish something very simple.  
The DSO images are not stored page-aligned and padded in the kernel image,
so the pages can't be used directly.  Storing them that way would use more
space in the kernel image on disk, and then you'd want to free initdata
page containing the unused one.
