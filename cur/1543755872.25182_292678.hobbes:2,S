No problem. Let the kernel tell the userspace application which card
to reset.

That could be very helpful for secondary cards.

With the approach I detailed in the thread starter, this is easily
possible. vesaposter can call the kernel function used to synchronize
in an endless loop and this kernel function would not only be used
to synchronize, but its return value would tell vesaposter what to do
to which card. An alternative would be to restart vesaposter as soon
as it has finished its job, which would make the POSTing reliable
even if the BIOS code hangs or causes crashes. The kernel can simply
store a list of video devices and their respective treatments and
the kernel function called by vesaposter would just iterate through
the list. Hmmm... why not call it
int video_helper(struct video_actions *what_to_do)
and it blocks until we have something to POST. It could contain
all the locking needed to serialize access to the video cards.
OTOH, if starting applications from initramfs at resume time is
easy, we could make video_helper non-blocking and start vesaposter
on demand.
And the problem of locking all application memory: The current tool
for POSTing and restoring video state (vbetool) uses only 27k on
disk. If we put it in initramfs, we could maybe avoid mlock
completely (if we can guarantee initramfs contents aren't swapped
out). And it would be available early enough for initializing
video hardware on boot.

Thanks for the pointers! I'll have to compare it to our current
userspace reset and vesa register restoring program
