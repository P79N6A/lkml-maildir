Exactly my thoughts. Increasingly as the numbers are rolling out it is clear 
the defaults seem to be pretty darn good (thanks mingo), but for -ck at least 
I wont be able to resist and will autoregulate them once I have a full set of 
numbers to play with. I'll get subsets of numbers (too messy to post them all 
here) and decide what to use for my ranges. It's my impression so far that 
the desktop experience with static numbers can only be improved upon by 
dropping the max timeslice to resemble that of the old scheduler. Perhaps a 
max timeslice of around 150ms.
