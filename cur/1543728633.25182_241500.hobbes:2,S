Hi Dan, 
I'm having the exact same problem on Mac OSX with the case-insensitive
HFS+ filesystem.
After looking the only files that use this rule are the vmlinux.lds
files. (Although there is one of them for each architecture.)
It is actually a bit frustrating because due to the way make works
this is a problem even if you use a separate build directory.
The solution is fairly striaght forward -- just change the suffixes,
the problem is exactly how to change them. I would propose changing it
such that was stick with "vmlinux.lds.S" and have it generate "vmlinux.lds"
This would require the fewest changes to implement, just
1/ change %.s %.S rule to %.lds %.lds.S
2/ change the link flags from "-T vmlinux.lds.s" -> "-T vmlinux.lds"
Cheers,
Benno
