hi
is it possible to determine the maximum number of processes at runtime?
I know about #define NR_TASKS, but that might not work if the binary is run
on a different machine than the one the program was compiled on.
PS
 I'm not looking for the maximum number of processes per user. I've found
that
by getrusage().
TIA
