One of my favorite "optimizing for Pentium" docs is
	
http://www.agner.org/assem/pentopt.pdf
		from
	
http://www.agner.org/assem/
which is current through newer P4's AFAICS.
It notes on the P4 specifically that LEA is split into additions and 
shifts.  Not sure what it does on the P3, but I bet it generates more 
uops in addition to the data dependency.
