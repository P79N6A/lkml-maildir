OK.

My reasoning behind this is - state is for device state
register and active is well for the state of the driver. All the other
names seemed for me to be too opaque for the purpose of it or already used.
flags souns static to me.
And you have to agree that it is *very* special
purpose if you look at the IDE_BUSY bit.
And finally - I took this name from the FreeBSD
code to make it look a bit more similar.
Another tought:
- We will have then an IDE_DMA which will indicate clearly
that we are expecting some async event for the sake of DMA.
But we have IDE_BUSY overloaded with both:
- Flagging that we are expecting an IRQ to arrive during
   PIO io (in conjencture with ->handler != NULL).
- Flagging that the do_request code path should be reentered
   immediately or is busy.
I thihink its hard but worth it to split the semantic overload.
In esp. a very fragile change. But I *feel* like it would
be worth it. Suggestions opinnions?
