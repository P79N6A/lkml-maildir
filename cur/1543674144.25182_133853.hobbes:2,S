This function only checks for HPA command set enabled (not supported).
I find it only useful when we see failed command in logs
and ">= 0", then we now it was READ_NATIVE_MAX command.
We check for secret OS in init_idedisk_capacity(). :-)

It is covered by init_idedisk_capacity() (capacity != native capacity)
and hdparm (HPA command set supported/enabled).
Can it go away?
