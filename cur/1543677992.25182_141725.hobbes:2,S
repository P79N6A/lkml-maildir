It looks like that someone tried to print something on the console
during fbcon initialization. It is not allowed to call fbdev's putc 
before mode set was issued (at least I always believed to it; before
first mode set hardware is in VGA state). Do not you see some error 
message in dmesg with these fixes?

Instead of plugging these tests into fast path please call
"matrox_init_putc(PMINFO NULL, NULL)" somewhere in the initMatrox2(),
before call to the register_framebuffer. At worst some part of video
memory gets smashed by painted characters, but no damage should
occur.
