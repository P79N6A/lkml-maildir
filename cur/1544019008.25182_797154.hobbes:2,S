Hi, I'm a new Linux kernel developer.
I filed a bug two weeks ago( 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/315782
 )
and now after some further research to determine the bug's location, I
am now determined to patch it.
I searched 
http://lxr.linux.no/linux
+v2.6.28.2/+search after
SYS_rename to see what the process is for renaming a file however I
can't find anything. Could anyone knowledgeable of the kernel point me
to where I should start digging?
Best regards
Nicklas W Bjurman
