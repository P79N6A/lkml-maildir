Linux supports entire _architectures_ of which there are single figures
of people using it.  What makes your hardware special ?

If you're adding kernel modules, you're more than using Linux, you're
developing _for_ linux.  You're just choosing to keep the fruits of
those labors to yourself.

You could.  But would you have had access to thousands of worldwide
contributors making your code better?
This is what you've missed out on with your current stance.

This excuse has been given time and time again, and repeatedly been 
proven false.  And as soon as one of your competitors makes their
drivers open, guess which one gets 1000+ free developers working
on their code ?

Please, revisit the 1990s. Read the cathedral and the bazaar.[1]
Listen to MC Hammer.   Realise the funky horror.  Then when you're ready
to revisit us with some points that haven't already been dismissed
please post again. Until then, you're offering nothing new.
