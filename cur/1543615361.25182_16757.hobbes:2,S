I'm curious as to why kernels shouldn't be built in /usr/src/linux. Also
this may be a dumb question but if I have built my kernels in /usr/src and want to move them to /home for eg. will that screw up things? Installing some apps from source sometimes they search for the kernel source during configure. If a kernel was compiled and moved to a different dir will this matter?
