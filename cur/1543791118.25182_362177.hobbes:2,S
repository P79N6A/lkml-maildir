P.S. There's a reason I'm trying to make a real working development system 
based on busybox and uclibc.  I think things like live CDs should be using 
that, not the GNU packages.
There seems to be a periodic trend, where ever few years open source programs 
get feature-laden enough that somebody forks off (or starts over) a version 
that has the sole virtue of being smaller and simpler.  From glibc->uClibc, 
gnome/kde->xfce, OpenSSH->dropbear, gnu->busybox...  Of course mozilla had to 
do this twice (Galleon, then Firefox) to get something remotely reasonable, 
but oh well.
(And it'd be really NICE if tcc became a reasonable replacement for gcc.  
Guess what the bloated memory-thrashing load that selectively triggers the 
OOM killer (when swappiness=0 but not when swappiness=60) I reported earlier 
is?  Building gcc 4.0.2, genattrtab and compiling the resulting 
insn-attrab.c.  It won't run in "only" 128 megs of ram at the best of 
times...)
