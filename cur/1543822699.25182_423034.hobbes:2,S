Hi,
I am using a linux-2.6.14 kernel.
I am trying to load my iSCSI module but when using insmod the error is
insmod: error inserting 'unh_scsi_target.ko': -1 Unknown symbol in module
linux:/home/chhavi/unh_iscsi.1.6.00/src # dmesg
unh_scsi_target: Unknown symbol scsi_bus_type
I had exported scsi_bus_type and rebuild the kernel.
its seen as exported in module.symvers.
I had used  EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() to prevent any license issues.
but still the error persists.
any help will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
