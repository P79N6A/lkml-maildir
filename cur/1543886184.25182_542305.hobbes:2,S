Ok, so your "acceptable use clause" of your addition should include that 
fact.  That the volatile type qualifier is legitimate when developing a 
new architecture and the only implementation you support for compilation 
of such text has a one-to-one correspondence between actual and abstract 
machine semantics.

Padding bytes are unspecified, not undefined.  I doubt ANSI C says 
padding bytes are undefined because then any implementation that pads 
members of a struct object would not be strictly conforming.
