Mode.
How does MASTER mode differ from PCI?
I have:
PDC20267: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 50
PDC20267: chipset revision 2
PDC20267: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PDC20267: ROM enabled at 0xe8000000
PDC20267: (U)DMA Burst Bit ENABLED Primary PCI Mode Secondary PCI Mode.
Another question - I have Promise Ultra100 and 2 disks:
hda: QUANTUM FIREBALL CX10.2A, 9787MB w/418kB Cache, CHS=19885/16/63, UDMA(33)
hdc: IBM-DTLA-305030, 29314MB w/380kB Cache, CHS=59560/16/63, UDMA(100)
Why Quantum is shown as UDMA 33 when Promise BIOS shows it as UDMA 66?
Why DMA Mode:       UDMA 4 in /proc/ide/pdc202xx for IBM disk?
Shouldn't it be UDMA 5?
