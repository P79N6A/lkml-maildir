Maybe.  It used to be that the superblock was not journaled, but I think
that recently changed.  This means that if tune2fs modified the superblock
and then a transaction also tried to modify it, the superblock would be
dirty and not part of a transaction, so an assertion would trigger.
It may be that we need to add journaled ioctls to ext3 to change the data
fields in the superblock, or find some other way to do this safely (maybe
Jeff Garzik's ext3meta filesystem to just read/write the "label" file?).
Cheers, Andreas
