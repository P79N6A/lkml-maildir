It's not about being not interested.
It's because I'd want my programs, and other users, to have exactly
the same access to the tgz contents through vfs as they have when
accessing the tgz file directly.  Not some baroque combination of
unobvious hard-coded permission rules, that aren't even visible
through stat(), and which both increase permissions for the user and
decrease it for others at the same time.
I see why you may want to hide certain things from other users
sometimes - the sshfs example is a good one.  I daresay Al Viro could
come up with a per-user or per-keyring mount point for those occasions :)
