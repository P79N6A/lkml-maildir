badblocks -n (non-destructive write-test) -vv /dev/hdc5

3 bad blocks found
This means it's broken?

I've to boot from a seagate 2 GB drive, which have real bad-blocks.(IT was
my fault).
And when I used it with linux, the error messages were very different (and
they are different today).
Those messages doesn't appears here. I don't think it's broken.
If someone can confirm that it's broken, please mail me. I bought it a
month ago and I can change it.
