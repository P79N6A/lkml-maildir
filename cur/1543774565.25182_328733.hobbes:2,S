Well the yealink driver is specifically targeted for the USB-P1K from
Yealink, I would be suprised if it works with the SK04.
Apart from that, the SK-04 manual seems to indicate that its a generic
HID keyboard with a generic USB sound card.
I dont have a generic HID usb keyboard myself so I cant give you first hand
infos.
In any case its best to consult the linux-usb-* mailing lists.
