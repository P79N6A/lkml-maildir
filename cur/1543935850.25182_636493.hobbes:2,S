This seems rather hacky.  Although it may turn out to be the most efficient
fix, dunno.
I'd have thought that the right fix would be to plug the race which you
described at the top-of-thread.  That might require some redesign, but it
sounds like the design is wrong anyway.
Maybe your proposed fix is suitable for a 2.6.24 bandaid..

OK, it's called infrequently, so a few extra IPIs there won't hurt.
btw, it's pretty damn sad that cpu_idle_wait() will always stall for at
least one second.  That's a huge amount of time and I bet it's thousands of
times longer than is actually needed..
