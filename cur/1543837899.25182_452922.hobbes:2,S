It'll override it, you can't run both at the same time.
Well, unless you have a dual-core/multi-cpu system, where you
could have a different governor per-core. But that would be loony,
and we should probably disallow that possibility before someone
gets any bright ideas.
Looking at your log however, you only have a single CPU, so it'll
be using userspace exclusively.

A userspace governor can pretty much invent its own rules. I'm not
familiar with what constraints powernowd has.  It may even have
limits defined in a config file someplace.
Is it behaving again with ondemand ?
