So we had two very different versions of "switch to 64-bit" and now we
have two mostly similar versions. Not a big improvement...

HPA tells me it is.

Please?

Mostly. I've written it at some point.
It may be a mess, but patch below is wholesale rewrite, mixing
cleanups (ebx->rbx) with serious changes (PGE). And then you tell me
it was tested on one machine. It is hard/impossible to rewrite, and
changelog is not helpful, either.
Please split it up.
