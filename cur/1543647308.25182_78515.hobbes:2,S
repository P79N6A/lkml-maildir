  [PATCH] Compaq PCI Hotplug bug fix
  
  Found the bug.  The following patch fixes the hot plug
  driver so that it has a fallback when there are no unused
  IRQs on a system.  At some point intialization got re-
  ordered and this was broken.
  
  I found another bug that was preventing the existing scheme from
  working.  It looks like the function "pcibios_set_irq_routing" is
  returning 1 for success, but the hot plug driver was interpreting it as
  failure.

  [PATCH] IBM PCI Hotplug: small patch
  
  This is a small patch on top of what you sent out to the kernel
  already.  I basically uncommented out another place, where we call
  pci_hp_change_info and changed to the new method.  And also, when I sent
  you those (polling, isa, pci...) patches sometime back, I made a mistake
  when I was translating the code from the way RPM is to the way we want in
  the kernel (since in RPM we cannot have option to compile kernel).
