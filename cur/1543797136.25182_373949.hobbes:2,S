It doesn't remove any "duplicated code", it only changes a spinlock to
an atomic_t for one single value (which I personally do not think is the
best thing to do, and based on the number of comments on this thread, I
think others also feel this way.)

Sure, that's the way kernel development is done.

The "normal" way of doing work like this is, do it somewhere, and then
break it all down into a series of steps, after you have figured out
exactly where you are going to end up.
Feel free to send me any patches that you feel should be applied that
work toward this end goal.
