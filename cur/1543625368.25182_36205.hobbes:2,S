I don't understand what you mean by this. As I see it, close-to-open 
consistency checking mandates that you do this. What if somebody changed the 
data on the server while you had the file closed?
Furthermore, inode->i_count == 0 offers no guarantees that the client doesn't 
for instance have dirty pages to write out.
Messing around with the value of i_mode in nfs_find_actor as you want to do 
in your patch is going to introduce new dimensions to this problem. For 
instance, magically changing a regular file into a symlink without first 
flushing out dirty pages and clearing the page cache is certainly going to 
produce som "interesting" results...
As I said yesterday: a test of the form
	if ((inode->i_mode & S_IFMT) != (fattr->mode & S_IFMT))
		return 0;
in nfs_find_actor might make sense since that forces the creation of a new 
inode. However it doesn't help at all with the same race if inode->i_mode 
hasn't changed. There is simply no way you can test for whether or not the 
file is the same on the server.
