Ok 2.4 (but for future try and mention which kernel version). You'll have 
to forgive me if i misunderstand you..

Are you referring to hardirq_trylock()?

Why after? it's currently in an interrupt anyway, the local_irq_count is 
per cpu so it's not used on other cpus why do you need to make it 
visible on other processors? (save irqs_running() but even that's ok)

I don't see or understand the race condition you're describing, 
local_irq_count is per cpu.
