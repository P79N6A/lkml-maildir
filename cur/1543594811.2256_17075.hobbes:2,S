They probably *want* people to port the .NET VM to Linux.  You should 
have seen their diagrams...  Lots of pretty boxes saying how the various 
parts of .NET work and a small greyed out area at the bottom saying 
'Win32'.  They kept saying 'Cross platform' and 'Open standards' (the 
VM* has been submitted to ECMA apparently)....
Of course when that happens everyone will continue using MS software, 
but on top of their chosen OS.  MS make more $$$ (we keep buying 
Exchange, Office, etc. but running them on Linux) and they are happy. 
MS Exchange runs on AS400/Solaris/etc., so it becomes an 'Enterprise' 
solution that PHBs throughout the world inflict on us, and MS make even 
*more* $$$.
