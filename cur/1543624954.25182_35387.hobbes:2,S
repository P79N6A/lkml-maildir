Some programs depends on tapping the system call table. For example private
ice and oprofile do this for execve and other calls to know when a new 
process is started. It would be possible to add function pointers to all these
functions, but just tapping the system call table actually looks cleaner
to me. 
[yes, the approach has module unload races, but these modules tend to just 
make themselves not unloadable]
