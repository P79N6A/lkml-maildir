     Well, for what it may or may not be worth, I've written to PTI and asked
them if this board in fact has NVRAM for loading new firmware or not.  I can
tell you I am amazed at the amount of stuff they manage to get on one single
S-bus slot, supposedly is a dual CPU card.  I think there is only about half a
dozen chips on the entire card and not much in the way of other components. 
     I remember the old SCSI-3 cards for Sun VME based systems, or actually
originally for the multi-bus, and then stuck in a multi-bus to VME adapter
which was a nightmare in itself, there must have been three or four hundred
components on those.
