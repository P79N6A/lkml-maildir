There is an idea.. :-) It would mean preserving page->reserved, but SLUB
has plenty of page flags to pick from. Or maybe I should move the thing
to a page flag anyway. If we do that SLAB would allow something similar,
just look up the page for whatever address you get and look at PG_emerg
or something.
Having this would clean things up. I'll go work on this.
