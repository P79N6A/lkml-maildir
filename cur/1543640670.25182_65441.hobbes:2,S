It shouldnt make any difference. Very old grb always passed mem=, which
did break some things because at one point it overrode the reporting of
holes and the like.
Shared graphic ram shouldnt in theory ever be causing hangs. The BIOS
E820 memory reporting should be excluding any video reserved memory from
its reporting. For the i810/845 its fractionally more complex once we go
into X11 (we allocate from the AGP pool ourselves) but not in console
mode.
