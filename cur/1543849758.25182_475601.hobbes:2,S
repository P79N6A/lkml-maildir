Is this for a 2.6 kernel?
If so, you need to build a 3.ko file, using the 2.6 kbuild
infrastructure.  See Documentation/kbuild/* for doc & examples.
Your error messages isn't a modversions error, but you can
easily enable or disable modversions using make <your_favorite>config.
It's listed under the "Loadable module support" menu.
