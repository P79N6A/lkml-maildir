Hello,
It seems "mem=2016M" is what we need, box works
approximately as fast as without enabled HIGHMEM.
Thank you!
BTW, we are using 4x512 Mb ECC Registered memory
modules, so they seems not to be mixed...
As this problem has gone, there is last question (I
hope ;-):
How can I control amount of memory used for disk cache
in recent kernels (2.4.18, 19)?
("Cached:" field in `cat /proc/meminfo`)
I have to be sure that free memory is not used for
caching of disk operations (or how many of it is used
for caching)
Thanks and please CC.
