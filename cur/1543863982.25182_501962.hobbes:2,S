I am using isochronous receive in RAW1394_DMA_PACKET_PER_BUFFER mode
because I am closing a simulation loop around the data that is
received/transmitted.  Just for giggles I cranked up a test
isochronous stream from a bus analyzer at 1kB per packet at 8kHz at
the S400 rate (i.e., one packet on each cycle start: 8MBps ), set the
machine up to listen, and was able to maintain 8kHz interrupts at ~12%
CPU utilization on a 2.8GHz Opteron.
   1744719 interrupts int 218.112 seconds is 7999.193 ints/sec
I wasn't doing anything with the data for this test, but I have had
the aforementioned sim running steady at a somewhat lower rate.  This
test ran under 2.6.20-rc5-rt10, but the more "productiony" system is
on 2.6.16-rt29.
So hopefully you can get markedly lower latencies.  Myself, I'm
tickled pink by the performance that can be achieved.
