It doesn't relate at all. The kernel still uses its own memcpy.
Note that a lot of the traditional memcpy optimizations (like WC copies) 
are pointless in kernel space because the kernel rarely deals with continuous 
memory areas larger than a 4K page.
The only difference from the patch is that instead of using an own
heuristic when to use an out of line memcpy trust gcc's heuristic.
