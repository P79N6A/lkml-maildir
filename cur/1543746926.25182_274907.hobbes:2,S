If you have a "can't happen" condition, it is just plain wrong to
return 0 and succeed. If you can't understand that, well, that's your
problem, not mine.
Now, if you want kernel that asks user "really mount ext3 on /dev/hda3
filesystem to /, WARNING: you should run fsck first, press f to do
that", that's your option, feel free to start your own kernel fork.
