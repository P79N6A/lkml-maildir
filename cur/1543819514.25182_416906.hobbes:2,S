xpc does something similar to this.  We have a module (xp.ko) which gets
loaded.  The client modules (xpnet.ko and xpmem.ko) register with xp.ko.
If xpc.ko is not loaded, the modules can not do any communication with
the other partitions of an SGI machine.  If xpc gets loaded, connections
are made to the other partitions and the modules begin to work across
the boundaries.
Hope that helps,
