Greetings,
Im using a Huawei E220 USB modem, currently running 2.6.22.5 vanilla kernel. It has worked fine for me since 2.6.21.
The lights give you a hint what mode its in. Green = usb_storage, Dark-blue = MODEM_slow, bright-blue = MODEM_fast (3G).
If the light is green after reboot, I need to reboot again until it turns blue. I know this sucks, but just something I've noticed.
One hint is to put the USB modem as static in kernel and usb_storage as module.
Best wishes
Kristoffer Ericson
