Hey all,
I just attempted to upgrade my kernel to 2.6.13. The kernel appears to 
boot and run just fine, but when I try to build any larger projects like 
Mozilla or the Linux kernel I constantly get segfaults from gcc. All 
other apps *seem* to work fine. I remember seeing this with 2.6.12 too 
when I tried to upgrade to it too but I didn't have the time to 
investigate at all then, but now I see the same problem with 2.6.13. The 
last version I've used that didn't show this problem is 2.6.11.3, and 
that's running with no problems here.
When gcc segfaults I get the following messages in the messages log:
cc1[16775]: segfault at 0000000000000000 rip 00000036f2b0119e rsp

I'm on a dual AMD Opteron system, running x86_64 code. Using Fedora Core 
2 (yeah, old, I know...) and gcc 3.3.3 20040412.
I've ran memtest etc on this system, and with 2.6.11.3 and older kernels 
I've ran this system under moderate load for months w/o rebooting and 
I've never had any problems like this, so I'm fairly certain that I 
don't have bad hardware.
Anyone have any clues as to what could be causing this problem?
