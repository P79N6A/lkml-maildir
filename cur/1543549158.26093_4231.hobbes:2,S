Hi, I've noticed that there are quite a few hardware performance counter
patches (which allow access to things like the Pentium Model Specific
Registers for gathering profiling info) floating around, including Rabbit
(
http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/Projects/Rabbit/
), Richard Gooch's patches, and
PAPI (very cool and portable, IMHO).  But I haven't seen any of these that
supports delivering interrupts when counters overflow (the last version of
PAPI that I saw provides high-level emulation of this on Linux/x86, but
it's not really accurate enough for serious work).  
  Is there any other patch that supports overflows on Linux/x86, or is it
work that still needs to be done?  Monitoring these overflows is the trick
behind large parts of Intel's VTune and SGI's SpeedShop, and I'd love to
see a profiler like this come to Linux.  Basically, I'm a student and I
think it would be an interesting project, but I don't want to re-invent the
wheel unnecessarily.  
  Thanks a lot!
