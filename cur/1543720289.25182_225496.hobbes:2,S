Does ever /etc/rcS.d/* require initrd?
Moreover, not all the world uses a keyboard, either.

Things even worse  can happen, too, such as  harddisk dying.  In those
problematic situations,  you'd rather boot a failsafe  partition, or a
rescue floppy, or Knoppix CD.

How  do you  do the  same if  you had  only SCSI  disks, but  the SCSI
modules are not loaded or compiled in?

Does embedded systems always have a keyboard?
