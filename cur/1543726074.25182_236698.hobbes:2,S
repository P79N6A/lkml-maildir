Subject: [PATCH] ppc64 SMT bugfix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/7/27/251

This patch is fairly straightforward.  maxcpus should be per SMT thread 
and not per physical processor.  SUSE picked this up back in May (was 
discussed on ppc64 mailing list) and has had no trouble with it.
