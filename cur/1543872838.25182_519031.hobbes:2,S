There is a way that I toyed with of creating maps of slots to use for each 
different priority, but it broke the O(1) nature of the virtual deadline 
management. Minimising algorithmic complexity seemed more important to 
maintain than getting slightly better latency spreads for niced tasks. It 
also appeared to be less cache friendly in design. I could certainly try and 
implement it but how much importance are we to place on latency of niced 
tasks? Are you aware of any usage scenario where latency sensitive tasks are 
ever significantly niced in the real world?
