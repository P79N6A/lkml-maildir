Why?
kmalloc() works fine. Anybody who needs 200 groups may be sane, but 
anybody who needs more than fits in a kmalloc() is definitely so far out 
that there is no point. 
The vmalloc space is limited, and the code just gets uglier.
Have you been looking at glibc sources lately, or why do you believe that 
we should encourage insane usage?
