Is there a tool though to map bus (PCI,USB etc) id's back 
onto modules which are likely[1] contain driver for them.
Given that many driver contain the Ids of the devices they will handle
within their source, if this tool doesn't exist it could be built
by ask modules to define a test_id function used both by themselves
in the normal (ie , called in place of the code it moves into a
seperate fucntion) way and compiled into a user space utility from the
same kernel source.
TTFN
[1]	Only likely, having met the nasty case of different
	hardware with the same PCMCIA id, and PCI hardware which has
	a range of Ids associated with it.
