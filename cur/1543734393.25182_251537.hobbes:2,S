The glaring exception is the IDE io completion, which can run for 2000+
usec even with a modern chipset and drive.  Here's a 600 usec trace:

The timer, RTC, and soundcard interrupts (among others) will not like
being delayed this long.  Ingo mentioned that this was not always done
in hardirq context; presumaby the I/O completion was done in a softirq
like SCSI.  What was the motivation for moving such a long code path
into the hard irq handler?
