so does Thomas and Jes. So what's the point?
i judge LTT by its current code quality, not by its proponents shouting 
volume - and that quality is still quite poor at the moment. (and then 
there are the conceptual problems too, outlined numerous times) I have 
quoted specific example(s) for that in this thread. Furthermore, LTT 
does this:
 246 files changed, 26207 insertions(+), 71 deletions(-)
and this gives me the shivers, for all the reasons i outlined.
