	This is a common result of this sort of scan.  The scan merely
provides good information, not a perfect patch.  There are two
possibilities:
	1) The scan is right, and the dereference is dangerous.  The
	   patch is correct.
	2) The dereference is not dangerous ("can't happen"), and the
	   later check for NULL is spurious.  A correct patch would
	   merely remove the check.
	This is clearly a case of (2), but I bet that (1) is seen just
as often.
