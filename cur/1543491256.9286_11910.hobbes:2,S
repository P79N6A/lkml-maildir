Actually, RedHat does distribute their own version of the kernel.
It is a modified kernel which includes PCMCIA, modular sound, and
several other patches.  So I guess we could look at it as the
RedHat kernel...

I agree with all of this too, and I prefer to just say "Linux"
myself as well.  I do believe however that GNU deserves much
credit that is not given due to the lack of the average person's
understanding of the whole picture.  It would be nice to see more
people credit GNU for their contributions to the community.  I
doubt we'll see it in the form GNU/Linux though, and I personally
would prefer some other form of credit given.  More GNU advocacy
perhaps.  I try to do my small part in my sig file...
