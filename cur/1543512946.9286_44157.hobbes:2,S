I recommend 2.9.5.x.x  ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/binutils/

Try running the gas testsuite through the old assembler ;-)
The major changes in the x86 assembler over the last year or so are:
 o  Greatly improved syntax checking to help catch hand-assembly errors
 o  New .intel_syntax mode
 o  Fixed badly broken 16-bit mode assembly - .code16 and .code16gcc
 o  Recognise new instructions - AMD, PIII, MMX, XMM etc.
 o  Assembly bugs fixed in a number of infrequently used instructions:
      o fwait form of floating point insn with another prefix.
      o "mov %al,(,1)", and other unusual index/base combinations
      o probably others, I forget.
 o  Don't emit prefixes when they will be ignored.
 o  Always use smallest form of index/base alternatives.

I assume Chris means my last two points above.  As far as I know, 
2.8.1.0.23 didn't completely mis-assemble anything used by the kernel.
