Yes, it does.  Cannot comment on your exam, though.

Not too big, actually.  The obvious implementation has to write data
twice (plus metadata, but that's minimal), so performance is ~50% of
normal.  With hard drives and a smarter implementation, you don't have
to worry about seek latency too much for the log, so performance is
usually better than 50%.  Basically, it hurts where you are good
enough anyway (large sequential writes) and goes unnoticed where
performance is bad (many small scattered writes).
The real problem is storage size.  Each write will *permanently*
reduce the filesystem size.  Maxtor and friends should happily sponsor
such development. :)
Seriously, such a thing is the perfect cure for "rm -rf foo /" and
similar famous mistakes and you can always just remove the oldest
backup data (preferrably after writing it to a tape).
