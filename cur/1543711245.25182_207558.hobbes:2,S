good to hear this (even scheduling inside an atomic kmap could be made
to work but I would find it less obviously safe since kumap_atomic would
need to be a noop for example).

I see what you mean now, so you suggest to run an unconditional
get_user(). It's hard to tell here, I agree the cost would be nearly
zero since the loaded byte from memory it'll go into l1 cache and it
would avoid a page fault in some unlikely case compared to what I
proposed, but I don't like too much it because I really like to optimize
as much as possible for the fast path always, so I still like to keep
the get_user out of the fast path. But you're right to argue since it's
hard to tell what's better in practice (certainly one could write a
malicious load where the additional pagefault could be measurable, while
the get_user would always be hardly measurable).
