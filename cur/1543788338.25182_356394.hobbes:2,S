Well, it's hard to swallow...
It's not about being not fully fair, it's about deadlocks that started
to appear after code changes inside retry loops...
A practical question is whether there is an "official" way to tell the CPU
that it should synchronize with memory, or if you have ideas how to make it
less costly than queued locks.
A theoretical question is how many places in the kernel use such retry loops
that may start to fail some day (or on some machines)...
