I got a new DSL connection last week, and right now I have a flat rate

That's the problem:
NIS is configured and tries to connect to the NIS server on localhost.
It uses portmap to locate the server, but portmap is not running.
2.2 just forwarded the error message to the application, but 2.4
silently ignores the error message because these error messages caused
spurious application faults.
Check your nis configuration (afaik /etc/nsswitch.conf)
