That is caused by klogd assuming it knows where the System.map is and
blindly using the wrong one.  Sorry folks but klogd as distributed is
broken.  Either start klogd with "-x" or apply
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops/v2.3/patch-sysklogd-1-3-31-ksymoops-1.gz
and use ksymoops to get a real back trace.
