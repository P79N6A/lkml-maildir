I need noapic since ever (5 years!) to get my USB controller running.
Without noapic it doesn't get any interrupts for some reason.
If now is the time to fix those bugs, I would be happy to try a new kernel
and get you the dmesg + result of plugging in an usb mass storage device
and reading from it on a DAILY basis.
If you need anything else to resolve the issue, I would be happy to help 
out here.
Maybe a pattern can be detected, which could help others.
If you like to blacklist this machine by DMI, that would also
help me.
Many Thanks!
Best Regards
Ingo Oeser
