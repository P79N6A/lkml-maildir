	Taking myself out of the role of someone who knows anything about the kernel --
and only knows application writing in the fields of GUI's and audio, what do you think
I'm going to use to check if their has been a playable CD inserted into the CD drive?
	There is an application called 'famd' -- which says it needs some kernel 
support to function efficiently -- perhaps that technology needs to be further developed
on Linux so app writers don't also have to be kernel experts and experts in all the
various bus and device types out there?
	Just an idea...?
