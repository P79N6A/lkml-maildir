Can we please have proper Kconfig dependencies instead of
| #ifdef CONFIG_LIRC_I2C
| #  error "This driver is not compatible with the LIRC I2C kernel configuration
| #endif /* CONFIG_LIRC_I2C */
| 
| #ifndef CONFIG_PCI
| #  error "This driver requires kernel PCI support."
| #endif /* CONFIG_PCI */
in drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtv-driver.h? Especially a dependency on
CONFIG_PCI would be nice (CONFIG_LIRC_I2C doesn't exist in mainline?).
| drivers/media/video/video-buf.c: In function 'videobuf_queue_pci':
| drivers/media/video/video-buf.c:399: error: 'pci_map_sg' undeclared (first use in this function)
Probably some new driver does a select VIDEO_BUF, which overrides that
VIDEO_BUF depends on PCI?
Thanks!
