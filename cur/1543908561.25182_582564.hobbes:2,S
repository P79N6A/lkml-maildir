What's the problem?  That line sets threshold to the smaller of the
current value or 125, which is exactly what one would want to do if
the maximum value is 125.  Just do a couple of examples: eg if threshold
is 100 going into that line, then the value is left alone; if
threshold is 150 then it gets set to 125; and that seems exactly correct.
