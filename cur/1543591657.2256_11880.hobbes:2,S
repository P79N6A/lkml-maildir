Well, if we did something like modify(int fd, char *how), you could do
modify(0, "nonblock,9600") 
which looks slightly better than special ioctl. You could even hack
libc to emulate ioctl with modify.
I thought about how to do networking without sockets, and it seems to
me like this kind of modify syscall is needed, because network sockets
connect to *two* different places (one local address and one
remote). Sockets are really nasty :-(.

Yup. OTOH making "new" system so powerfull that it could lead to
ioctls emulated in libc would be very nice, too.
