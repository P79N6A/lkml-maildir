Subject: ISA-PNP /proc interface in 2.4.0 : 100% CPU!

Hi,
I have an old ISA-PNP soundcard whose driver doesn't currently use the
ISA-PNP services. I have therefore been activating this card by
writing to the /proc/isapnp interface. And in an idle moment, I tried
an "auto" instruction:
cat > /proc/isapnp << EOF
card 0 ENS3081
dev 0 ENS0000
auto
EOF
This operation didn't return and system CPU usage then climbed to
100%, although the box didn't lock up. Further investigations showed
that the problem happened when either the isapnp_config_activate() or
isapnp_config_deactivate() functions tried to acquire the
isapnp_cfg_mutex. This seemed to be because they tried to acquire the
mutex for the specific devfn (zero in this case), but the
isapnp_set_card() function has already acquired it using -1 instead.
Couldn't the isapnp_autoconfigure() function use isapnp_activate() and
isapnp_deactivate() instead of isapnp_info_device->activate() and
isapnp_info_device->deactivate()? The former don't try to acquire the
mutex, and are precisely what the "activate" and "deactivate" /proc
commands invoke anyway.
Cheers,
Chris
