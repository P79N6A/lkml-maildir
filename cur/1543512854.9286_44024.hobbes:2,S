A better solution would be a generic MSR interface.
I know of two that are written, one by Stefan Meyer (I think), and
another by Richard Gooch.
Stefan's uses a device, which IMHO is a little wasteful, as you
could just export things to /proc.
Richards seems to rely upon devfs, which is a shame if you
don't use devfs.
In both the implementations above, you also don't get to see
what MSRs are available.
I've got a 75% written /proc MSR interface, any interest?
regards,
Dave.
