Hello!

It depends. The fact is that you have "bad" clients, whether
it is deliberate or not. Valid WEB connections cannot finish
in LAST-ACK state.
LAST_ACK timeout is too long, and if clients close connection
and hide, corpeses will live for very long time (btw each of them may
eat 64K of memory, multiply by 5000!). Apache is not able
to detect and kill them, unfortunately.

Please, make "netstat -t -n -o|grep LAST_ACK" and send it (gzipped! 8))
me.
