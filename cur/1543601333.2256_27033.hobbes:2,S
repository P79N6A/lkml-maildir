Hi Masoud:
I created a new CD that only contains linux-2.4.6.tar.gz (23Mb), and
this CD duplicates my problem.  On 2.2.19, I can copy the tar file from
the CD, and it is the same as the original, but when using 2.4.6, I get
an IO error.
However, when I tried to copy the CD image to a file, I get the
following IO error regardless of which kernel I use.
	# dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/tmp/cd.iso
	dd: /dev/cdrom: Input/output error
	1440+0 records in
	1440+0 records out 
Does this shed any more light on what I am doing wrong.  Is there
another way for me to create a CD image for you?
Thanks,
Bruce
