Yes, that's right, thanks. I know I do one more end_that_request_first
than is necessary, but it is harmless as there is a guard in the 
kernel code. At least, it's harmless until someone removes that guard.
It is like that because I added the while loop to the front of the code I
already had working when I decided to try plugging.
