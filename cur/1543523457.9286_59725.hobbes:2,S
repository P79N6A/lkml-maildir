My personal point of view is that the winner technology will be the one that
exposes __very__ __raw__ instruction sets that can be programmed in a
software
way ( the way partially chosen by the crusoe of Transmeta, IA64 of Intel and
mostly
the raw computing technology ).
Into the __very__ __raw__ instruction sets I'd like to be included also the
ones that control
cache invalidations and prefetching methods.
Higher one can think the level of intelligence stored into the CPU for
choosing these strategies,
only the application writer ( or OS writer ) can give a fine tuning of its.
Davide.
