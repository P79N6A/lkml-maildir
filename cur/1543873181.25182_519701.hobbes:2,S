Compared to 2.6.20.1 (will try 2.6.20.2 as well), I now get:
[  199.361347] BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#2!
smp_percpu_timer_interrupt+0xd4/0x180
tl0_irq14+0x1c/0x20

kjournald+0xc0/0x1e0
kthread+0xb0/0xc0

keventd_create_kthread+0x20/0xa0
shortly after the serial console prompts for login.
Thanks,
