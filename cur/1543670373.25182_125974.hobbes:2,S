Heh, it's a valid question.  I like per-module attributes, but I don't
think they are as nice for userland tools.  I don't acutally like
encoding namesapce into the attribute value, but I'm not sure the
alternative is much different/better.

You mean to ensure that labels are accumulated rather than replaced?
Could be useful I suppose.
