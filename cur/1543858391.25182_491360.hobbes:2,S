-rc1 does include a reasonably big firewire update, but I'm not sure how 
it will affect your camera usage. In fact, the ieee1394 people seem to be 
trying to deprecate the dv1394 stuff, in favour of just raw1394 and 
user-mode libraries.
I think you can tell Kino to use either the DV or the raw interface, but 
I'm not sure. If you can, try either. The raw interface seems to be 
horribly misdesigned (security problems), but is the one to use.
But by all means, give it a shot, and regardless of whether it works 
better or not, you might want to cry on the shoulder of Stefan Richter 
<stefanr@s5r6.in-berlin.de> about the issues you see.. Of course, please 
talk to the Kino people too (although I have absolutely no idea who they 
would be).
