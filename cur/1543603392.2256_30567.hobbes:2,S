In former versions of ReiserFS you had a weak support for fschk. And since a
lot of bugs and heavy load triggered this problem regularly, it was not
awise idea to use Reiser. Things are reported to have increased, but I do
not have any first hand experineces since then.
Personally I think xfs is a very mature Journaling File System. A bit
annoying is, that the CVS tree is hard to track from SGI. I have reports
from heavyly loaded servers that it performs very well (i.e. newsspool).
ext3 is the alternative, cause of its compatibility to ext2. But I am not
sure, if this is good or bad, since it has not increaesed some of the
performance issues of the ext2 structure, afaik.
I have no experience with JFS, IBM seems to missed a opportunity to have
large community support.
GFS as a general purpose filesystem may need some more tweaking, but it's
cluster properties are great for enterprise systems.
