| Well tabs should _never_ be assumed to be 8, and in this regard, as I 
| see it, CodingStyle has a bug. Tabs are there so that the user can set 
| their width according to _their_ taste, simply so that both sides,
| 
| 	from CodingStyle:
| 	Tabs are 8 characters, and thus indentations are also 8
| 	characters.  There are heretic movements that try to make
| 	indentations 4 (or even 2!) characters deep, and that is akin
| 	to trying to define the value of PI to be 3.
| 
| Linus (did he wrote that part?) and the heretics both can have their fun 
| without impacting each other. If we wanted to force the user to have 
| exactly 8 screen blanks, we should use spaces throughout.
| 
| (And BTW,  int pi = 3.141592 _is_ going to be 3 ;-) and floating point 
| is mostly an agreed no-go in kernel anyway, even if it's supported.)

Dunno who wrote that part :(. Jan, look:
	Now, some people will claim that having 8-character indentations makes
	the code move too far to the right, and makes it hard to read on a
	80-character terminal screen.  The answer to that is that if you need
	more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix
	your program.
your opinion? Is it a bug too? Don't get me wrong I'm just trying to clarify
coding style.
