I added the print out of the message to see in what state was the card
being left after it was wedged.
The card seems to be locking up with undefined opcodes, atleast according to
my specs. 
The command doesn't necessarly come from the driver, I'we done some
experimenting and it seems that sending the card an undefined opcode
will lock up the card with a different value in the command register.
I am still waiting for latest specs from intel, I wonder if the new
specs will define those values.
