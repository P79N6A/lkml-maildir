bugzilla.kernel.org is, umm, improving.
It would be an intersting exercise for someone to spend a few days seeing
how many of the bugzilla reports they personally can reproduce.  I'd guess
"zero".  There's a lesson in that.
The problem with bugzilla will be that it will be hard to find reports
where the reporter will be able to work with you on the fix - we've let
them go cold.
The most fruitful place to find fixable bugs is linux-kernel.  People who
report bugs there are sufficiently motivated to have actually sent the
email and the bug is still recent, so they probably haven't done the
Solaris install yet.
