You should not get a write error when reading a tape drive. Are you
sure you got the 'Error on write filemark' while reading?
Otherwise, this just looks like the kind of error you get if the
tape has gotten (logically) damaged. If it's one of those tapes that
doesn't require a format, just reuse it during your next backup. If it's
one of those that requires a 'factory format' (bummer), throw it
away.
