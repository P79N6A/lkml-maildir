This is insanity. When I get a new kernel, I drop it straight into
/usr/src/linux. Compile away. I understand you're saying that this could
break some programs because because of changes in include file, but
thats what opensource is for. You notice something breaks, you patch it.
Try the fix on a machine still running an old kernel. Does it work? If
it compiles on both systems, submit the fix. Move on. Telling people to
change the way they've ALWAYS compiled kernels is not the answer.
Caution is good. People should have enough sense to back up old source
(unless you have your own personal T1 and its not a problem to download
a new kernel), but don't put safeguards that change 3 year old unix
standards into the system. Maybe I'm out of line and missed the point of
the conversation here. Pardon me if I am. If I'm not out of line, then
you know how I feel about the situation:).
