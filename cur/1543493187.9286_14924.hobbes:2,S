This is old news. I even did a patch: [hopefully noone uses 386's for
multiuser shell servers :-)] . But still it is a bug. I think it
should be fixed.
I do have 386. If you post me nice .c program, I'll happily test it
for you. [What about duplicating it by forcing kernel to think it has
old 386. That should work - 486+ all backward compatible after all.]
Linus, would you mind closing this security hole?
