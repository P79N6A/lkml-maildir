Subject: [patch 1/9] uml: fix lvalue for gcc4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This construct is refused by GCC 4, so here's the (corrected) fix. Thanks to
Russell for noticing a stupid mistake I did when first sending this.
As he noted, the code is largely suboptimal however it currently works, and
will be fixed shortly. Just read the access_ok check on
fp which is NULL, or the pointer arithmetic below which should be done with a
cast to void*:
 	frame = (struct rt_sigframe __user *)
 		round_down(stack_top - sizeof(struct rt_sigframe), 16) - 8;
The code shows clearly that has been taken from
arch/x86_64/kernel/signal.c:setup_rt_frame(), maybe in a bit of a hurry.
