Easy enough, the code is still there, just the result is no longer used.
But unless you have good reason, you should not wish those old times
back. This geometry stuff has caused such a large amount of pain.
Set your geometry to the constant */255/63 - depending on precisely
what you did, that may already have been what you got from 2.4 anyway.
Complain if you have troubles - specify BIOS type, geometry, operating
system that has problems booting.
I hope we'll find out that everything can be made to work without
kernel support.
