The drive went for a walk and didn't come back
That could be a whole pile of things (for reference I get 100+ day
uptimes on VIA mini-itx boxes)
1. Overheating
2. Lack of power
3. Some glitch that then triggers the kernel error recovery into
upsetting the drive.
If it reboots back happily then all 3 are quite plausible
