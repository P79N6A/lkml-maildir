Hi Andre!
I'm sending you (and others who might be interested) my latest VIA and
IDE drivers. The VIA driver (v3.15) should have a complete support for
UDMA100 on the vt82c686b chip, the AMD driver (v1.5) should have full
UDMA100 support on the amd766 ViperPlus chip.
They're also a little more foolproof with respect to the 'idebus'
setting, which is quite a misnomer, btw.
Care to try them out?
Andre, you're the only one I know of having the 766 chip, so please test
this driver, I'd like to know if it really works ... thanks.
