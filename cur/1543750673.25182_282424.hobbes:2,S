That makes sense. I wonder if those architectures may just want to
implement it anyway. If this is such a win here, then it may be low
hanging fruit for those architectures.
But I guess there is something fundamentally a bit different when you
have two processes competing for L1 cache *at the same time*.

Interesting, thanks.
