Occasionally,  we get errors like these:
Jun  9 00:56:35 [kernel] [18020.416620] PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space 
for 12288 bytes at device 0000:03:01.0
and it looks like it might have something to do with these messages 
(after updating and setting BIOS as below):
Jun 15 16:38:54 [kernel] [    0.000000] Checking aperture...
Jun 15 16:38:54 [kernel] [    0.000000] CPU 0: aperture @ 0 size 256 MB
Jun 15 16:38:54 [kernel] [    0.000000] No AGP bridge found
Jun 15 16:38:54 [kernel] [    0.000000] Your BIOS doesn't leave a 
aperture memory hole
Jun 15 16:38:54 [kernel] [    0.000000] Please enable the IOMMU 
option in the BIOS setup
Jun 15 16:38:54 [kernel] [    0.000000] This costs you 64 MB of RAM
Jun 15 16:38:54 [kernel] [    0.000000] Mapping aperture over 65536 
KB of RAM @ 8000000
The box is a dual Opteron 250 with an Arima HDAMA Rev. D motherboard.
The updated BIOS options are (with * for current setting)
MTRR mapping method [Continuous, Discrete*]
Memhole mapping [Software, Hardware*]
4 GB memory hole adjust [Disabled, Manual, Auto*]
4 GB memory hole size [128 MB]
IOMMU [Disabled, Enabled*]
Size [multiple sizes, 256 MB*]
Initially, I was booting kernel 2.6.16.1 with iommu=merge, but the 
above message still occur when I booted without any iommu kernel 
parameters.
First, am I correct to assume that I'm not getting the 256 MB?
Second, is the the case the BIOS is lying?
Third, what could be a workaround to get enough memory for the PCI 
card that causes the out of space error (3Ware 8506)?
