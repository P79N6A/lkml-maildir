*This* point I got from the beginning, once I tried to think how it all
is done internally (I never thought about that, because I'm not a kernel
hacker to start with) -- currently, linux has ugly/racy places which are
either difficult or impossible to fix, all due to this O_DIRECT thing
which iteracts badly with other access "methods".

Half-way?

Well.  In fact, there's NO problems to admit.
Yes, yes, yes yes - when you think about it from a general point of
view, and think how non-O_DIRECT and O_DIRECT access fits together,
it's a complete mess, and you're 100% right it's a mess.
But.  Those damn "database people" don't mix and match the two accesses
together (I'm not one of them, either - I'm just trying to use a DB
product on linux).  So there's just no issue.  The solution to in-kernel
races and problems in this case is the usage scenario, and in following
simple usage rules.  Basically, the above requiriment - "don't mix&match
the two together" - is implemented in userspace (yes, there's no guarantee
that someone/thing will not do some evil thing, but that's controlled by
file permisions).  That is, database software itself will not try to use
the thing in a wrong way.  Simple as that.

When done properly - be it in user- or kernel-space, it IS correct.  No
database people are ftruncating() a file *and* reading from the past-end
of it at the same time for example, and don't mix-n-match cached and direct
io, at least not for the same part of a file (if there are, they're really
braindead, or it's just a plain bug).

I recall again the above: the actual USAGE of O_DIRECT, as implemented
in database software, tries to ensure there's no brokeness, especially
fundamental brokeness, just by not performing parallel direct/non-direct
read/writes/truncates.  This way, the thing Just Works, works *correctly*
(provided there's no bugs all the way down to a device), *and* works *fast*.
By the way, I can think of some useful cases where *parts* of a file are
mmap()ed (even for RW access), and parts are being read/written with O_DIRECT.
But that's probably some corner cases.
