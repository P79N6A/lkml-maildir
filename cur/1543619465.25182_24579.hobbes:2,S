Subject: BUG:  broken I830MP AGP support in 2.4.17 and 2.4.18pre7

I'm blessed with a new Dell Inspiron 4100, which is in turn blessed with
the i830MP AGP chipset.  It's identical to the i830M except it doesn't
have the on-chip graphics controller.
When trying to load up the agpgart module under 2.4.17, I get:
>Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
>agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 262M
>agpgart: Detected an Intel 830M, but could not find the secondary device.
Fine, I see that 2.4.18pre supposedly has fixes for the I830MP.  So I
compile it, slap it in place.. and get:  (with 2.4.17pre7)
>Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
>agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 262M
>agpgart: unsupported bridge
>agpgart: no supported devices found.
lspci yields:
>00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 3575 (rev 02)
>        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0
>        Memory at d0000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=256M]
>        Capabilities: [40] #09 [0105]
>        Capabilities: [a0] AGP version 2.0
So it appears not all is well with the I830MP patch.
(Yes, I have tried the 'agp_unsupported' option in both cases)

I ain't broke, but I'm badly bent.                           ICQ# 1318344
