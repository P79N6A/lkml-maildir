There has been many lengthy debates in the postgresql mailing list,
and it seems that there has been _strong_ resistance to it.
IMHO, a best scheme would be
        - leave _obvious_ patterns to the kernel
                i.e. all kinds of (semi-)sequential reads
        - do fadvise() for _non-obvious_ patterns on _critical_ points
                i.e. the index scans
