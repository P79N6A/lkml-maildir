Hey, this is cool, I've wanted something like this for a long time.
However, I was thinking of implementing it in mkinitrd, not in the
kernel proper.
OT1H, having it in the kernel proper makes it easier to support even
on distros whose mkinitrd doesn't support this stuff, or that don't
even use an initrd.  OTOH, having it in mkinitrd means you can use
this even on distros whose kernels don't support chroot=.
And then, given that booting up a kernel from one distro on another
requires setting up /lib/modules for proper functioning (unless your
mkinitrd does that for you, which is something else I've been thinking
of doing for similar reasons), I figured changing mkinitrd might be a
better way to go.
