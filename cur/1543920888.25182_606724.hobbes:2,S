Mmm. Like I said, when a live filesystem is mounted on a bdev,
it isn't like you want userspace to go dancing around on it without
knowing exactly what it is doing.
The kernel more or less does the right thing here with respect to
the *state* of the data[*] (that is, buffer heads and pagecache).
It's when you actually start changing the data itself around is when
you'll blow up the filesystem.
[*] The ramdisk code is simply buggy, right? (and not the buffer
    cache)
The idea of your patch in theory is OK, but Andrew raises valid
points about potential coherency problems, I think.
