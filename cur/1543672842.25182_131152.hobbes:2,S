Originally I never got usb to work with acpi, until one day I found out that
irq12 needed to be in use (!). If I booted with a ps/2 mouse, it worked perfect.
After some investigation, I found out that my BIOS had a setting for PS/2 mouse,
which were disabled, enabled and auto. Auto were the default. The irq 12 was
only reserved when there was a mouse at boot. If I set it at enabled, it always
reserved irq 12. After I found this out, usb worked perfect untill 2.5.69.
My motherboard is a Asus CUV266-DLS, Dual P3. Why irq12 has to be enabled, I
have never understood. 
As a curiosity, I might tell you that when I boot my motherboard with MPS1.4
enabled, I have to disable the secondary ide port to get it to boot Linux. BUT,
when I do that, usb doesn't work (without acpi). So I have to use MPS1.1 and
have the secondary ide port enabled to get usb working without acpi. It was
better with 2.5.68 :( I guess this is just my motherboard being fscked up, but
other OS' boot fine, regardless of PS/2 mouse and/or secondary IDE port enabled.
Best regards,
Stian
