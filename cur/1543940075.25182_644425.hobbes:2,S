Hi,
I took some time today and went through Wolfgangs scenarios partly. Now 
some results from my side. I ran my tests on a 2.6.24-rt1

I also got high latencies without CONFIG_RCU_TRACE set at all. setting 
CONFIG_RCU_TRACE to y or m causes also high latency though in my test 
runs. Hence I doubt the rcu Tracer is really the problem.
As I mentioned in my last mail. Only thing I could reproduce reliably is 
that the measurement results depend heavily on kind of the non-rt 
Workload. For with hackbench or cache calibrator I couldn't produce 
abnormal high latencies. Nor could I produce the hight latencies on a 
system booted via flash. Hence my suspects stays on the fec irq thread 
and filesystem access routines.

Since I was producing high latencies independently from the rcu 
settings. I didn't spend a lot of time playing around with the GEN_BD 
and dynamic clock. All I can say is that disabling them also cause high 
latency. ;-) The average results don't differ significantly in my test runs.
