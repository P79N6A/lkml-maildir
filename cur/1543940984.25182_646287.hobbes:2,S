I am fixing it up for you this time, but please do not
reference the commit this way.
Say something like:
  blah blah blah in commit $(SHA1_HASH) ("commit head line").
The author and date give no real useful information in
this context, the important part is giving the reader
enough information to find the commit should they wish
to gain more information.
If they have the commit hash they can usually find the
commit, but if that fails they can search the commit
messages for the head line text string.
I feel like I've had to explain this 10 times in the past week...
