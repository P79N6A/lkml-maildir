Subject: vremap and memcpy_to_fs in 2.2.x?

I'm porting a PCI card driver from 2.0.x to 2.2.x -- on an Alpha -- and
I have two questions:
What are the equivalent functions for vremap() and memcpy_to_fs().
From what I can find:
vremap() -> ioremap() However, on an alpha kernel, ioremap just
returns                       the passed-in address. I've tried
phys_to_virt,                       but I'm not sure that it gives me
what vremap did.
memcpy_to_fs -> copy_to_user() I tried this also, but I get a virt
page                                fault.
Thanks,
-A.
