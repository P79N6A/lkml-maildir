The issue was that libc include files could step on kernel include
files due to symlinks in /usr/include/linux to /usr/src/linux/include.
IIRC the issue is that include files must point to those with which
the libc was compiled for proper userland compilations.   
The latest File Hierarchy Standard states that for glibc based systems,
/usr/src can be whatever it wants but that for libc5 based systems,
6.1.7 /usr/include :
Header files included by C programs These symbolic links are required if a C 
or C++ compiler is installed and only for systems not based on glibc. 
/usr/include/asm -> /usr/src/linux/include/asm-<arch> 
/usr/include/linux -> /usr/src/linux/include/linux
Thus, practice dictated that it was safer to build the linux kernel somewhere 
other than /usr/src/linux.   Since the kernel is shipped with it's own 
include files, it works just fine building the kernel anywhere else; I am 
building under /home/kernel/linux-x.y.z.
