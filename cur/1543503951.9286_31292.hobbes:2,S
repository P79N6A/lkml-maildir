Subject: sk_buff and neighbor struct in 2.2

I have been looking for documents about the new "struct sk_buff" and
"struct neighbor" concepts in kernel version 2.2 for a long time.
My problem is that a device driver which I have to port from 2.0 to 2.2
uses the arp field (determines if arp already has been done) of the old
"struct sk_buff" which is not available anymore in the new "struct
sk_buff" of version 2.2.
Perhaps someone could point me to documents or other resources which
describe the new concept of "neighbors"?
Thanks!
