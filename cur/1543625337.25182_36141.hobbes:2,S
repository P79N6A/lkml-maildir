The CPU is what triggers the exception.
So this sounds like a defect (or overheated) CPU to me.
OTOH, the kernel logs "invalid operand". Could you run ksymoops to get a
disassembly?
AFAICS, its a push %ebp instruction, which should not be illegal. So either
your stack is overflowing or my suspicion with the defect CPU is applicable.
