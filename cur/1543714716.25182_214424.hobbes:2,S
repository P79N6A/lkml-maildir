The Module.symvers file is only generated if you have a minimum of one module
in the kernel. I'm in the process of fixing this.
Also the Modules.symvers file is not needed when CONFIG_MODVERSIONS are turned
off - so I will fix this also.
Thanks for the hint (monolithic kernel with module support enabled).
The workaround for now is just to declare a simple driver a module.
For example the dummy driver in the net section.
