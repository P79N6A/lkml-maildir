Ext3 with ordered writes (the default) gets this right. 
Unfortunately, cheating can give you better benchmark resuls, and some
people seem to care more about better benchmark results than silly
things like user's files not getting wiped.  For many workloads,
especially for user desktops, the disk bandwidth isn't saturated, and
given that most writes are asynchronous in nature, a faster write
benchmark for a particular filesystem or filesystme mode may not
translate into a user-visible difference.  So focusing on improved
write speeds at the cost of data robustness can very often be false
economy.
