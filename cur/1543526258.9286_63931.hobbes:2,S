 Go read the datasheet.

 A CPU generates INTA cycles for whatever interrupt requests it receives
provided dispensing of them is enabled.  I doesn't check (how would it?) 
whether a request comes from an 8259A or from another chip.  It's surely
not right for INTA cycles to arrive at an 8259A if it's not an originator
of the IRQ yet Intel MP systems give you the ability to be configured in
such a way.  The 8259A has to deal somehow with this situation and someone
might actually make some use of such a setup (i.e. one does not have to
treat chips religiously and configure them only into the blessed by the
manufacturer mode -- digital chips are just a bunch of logic gates which
may be configured in any way the hardware dependencies allow).

 Intel MP systems work differently.  Go read datasheets.

 Guess what vector is put in this polling mode if no IRQs are pending...

 Go read the datasheet.

 Given how cluelessly was the IBM PC designed I wouldn't say its designers
had comprehensive knowledge on ICs used as its components.

 Note these are secondary works.  Intel's datasheets are the original
ones.

 See the input circuitry diagram in the datasheet.  Although there is a D
latch at the input, it's only used as an edge-detect logic in the
edge-triggered mode -- it's set upon a rising edge and reset upon a
falling edge, an INTA cycle or the ICW1 command.

 Hmm, I guess you are writing of some other interrupt controller.

 You refer to ISR not to IRR, for sure.  Go read the datasheets.

 You are writing of an INTA cycle for sure.
 Please don't bother to comment on this mail -- there is no point in
negating facts.  Unless you are writing of something else than Intel
8259A.  In this case please state clearly what IC you are writing of.
