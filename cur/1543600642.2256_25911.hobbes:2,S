Someone reported to me that LOADLIN consistently fails to load kernels
> 1 MB both with and without A20 changes; probably it tries to use the
old "sector count" field in the kernel.  This would explain what we
have observed, and so I consider this matter closed as far as I'm
concerned.  LOADLIN needs to be updated to continue to be useful, and
I don't know if Hans is still around, even.
