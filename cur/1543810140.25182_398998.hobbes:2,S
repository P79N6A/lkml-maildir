And, from a userspace perspective, it sucks. I'm in the process of 
writing patches to transition them all over, and I'd prefer not to have 
to write one for your driver as well :)

I'm doing so.

Volume and brightness are things that can easily be exposed through the 
input layer, and if you're running X then it's much easier to handle 
events that come through the input layer than ones which come from 
acpi/events. There's four keycodes for programmable buttons specced (see 
/usr/include/linux/input.h - _PROG1-4), so that would fit quite nicely 
as well.
Doing it via the input layer adds flexibility - it makes it easier for 
non-root uesrspace to handle things, but you can still have a root-level 
daemon that monitors /dev/input/event* and runs commands in response to 
keycodes.
