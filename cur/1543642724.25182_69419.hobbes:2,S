perhaps Remote IRR might help there?

As an aside, i just had an idea for another way to improve interrupt 
handling latency. Instead of walking through all the isrs in the chain, 
we can have an isr flag wether it was the source of the irq, and if so we 
stop right there and not walk through the other isrs. Obviously taking 
into account that some devices are dumb and have no real way of 
determining.
