Sure, but if you're going to include the filename in the cookie, on
the client side you now have to store a variable-length state, which
probably means you'll need to allocate and free memory each time; and
if the filename is 256 characters, you'll have to send that back in
the next readdir() request. 
If we could get filename + 64bits, sure, that would be great.  I was
just assuming we couldn't get it --- and if we can't get it, 256 bits
is two SHA-1 hashes.  So that's one hash for the filename, and 128
bits for a filesystem's internal hash collision.  There might be other
ways that the space could be divided up, which might be somewhat
wasteful of space --- say you need a host identifier for a clustered
filesystem, although arguably adding a host might be infrequent enough
that you just use the cookie verifier hammer and force the client to
get a new set of readdir cookies.  :-)

I wouldn't complain too much about 128 bits, but if we're going to go
fixed size, I can imagine filesystems where that might not be enough.
And the differecen between 16 and 32 bytes isn't that great.  But I
could easily live with either filename + 64bits, or 128 bits.
