I have successfully built 2.4.1-pre7 and am now running same.
I just finished rebuilding 2.4.1-pre7 using 2.4.1-pre7, so everything
is looking fine now.
I was incautiously running 2.4.1-pre5 with the newly integrated
ReiserFS even though I knew that potential problems were being
worked out.
BTW, it looks like I get the same messages when shutting down 2.4.1-pre7 
associated with having ReiserFS as the root filesystem.  This was fixed with 
2.4.0-ac1. The patch to fix this was posted to the reiserfs-list.
