I did some more tests, i replaced my Radeon card with an older R128 one,
and enabling DRI makes it crawl, it's worse then windows95 on a 386 :(
It seems there's an incompability with my hardware somewhere, but i
can't put my finger to the exact cause of the system, the only known
recurrence is that agpgart incorrectly specifies the agp aperture size
regardless of AGP card i use, and regardless of my BIOS settings.
With this R128 i *can* enable DRI, but it only sees 8MB of video ram,
the mtrr entry has a write-combining line of 32MB (the incorrect size of
my AGP aperture) and any disk access seems to halt the X server.
I've never had any problem like this before with linux, and i'm stumped
as to how to solve it, hopefully, someone here can provide me with some
more hints & tricks
