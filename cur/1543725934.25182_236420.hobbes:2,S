Agreed.  The two problems are orthogonal. [1]
As an example where sharing the super_block is wrong (albeit probably
just an oversight) is that the protocols (udp vs tcp) are not compared
in nfs_compare_super.  You could argue that the client fhandles should
be different though, I'm not sure..
Another 'bind mount extension' that would be nice to change at the
vfsmount level may be w/rsize, but that is probably a very intrusive
change for nfs and probably not possible.  Thoughts?
[1] - I haven't tested mounting nfs ro, and then mounting nfs rw using
the bind extensions.  Does nfs make any assumptions about the mount
being ro?
