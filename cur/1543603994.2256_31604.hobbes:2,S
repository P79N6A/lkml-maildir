There's no way we should implement "simon_says".
There's a difference between stupiud hardware changing memory from under
us through mapping tricks, and cache coherency in general.
What you want is the "memory_went_away_from_us()" kind of cache flush,
which has nothing at all to do with cache coherency. And it should be
explicitly and clearly named THAT, and you should not blame the fact that
x86 is always 100% cache coherent and that the normal cache coherency
routines should _never_ be anything but a nop.
Also note that wbinvd is known to corrupted the caches and lead to lockups
on certain x86 cores. You need to be a _lot_ more careful than just doing
it indiscriminately from a driver.
