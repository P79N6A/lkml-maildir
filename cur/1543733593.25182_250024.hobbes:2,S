Thanks,
Stupid quoted printable; in case anyone is wondering, you have to tell
mutt to explictly *not* use quoted printable with GPG signing by
setting pgp_strict_enc=no.  If you're going to try and send patches
inline with your message (as suggested by
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html
) and you want them gpg signed,
you probably want it off!
