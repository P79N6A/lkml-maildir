Hi,
Maybe you don't know, but current Linux kernel (starting somewhere in
testNN, probably test10 series) won't boot with HPT370 controller. With
current setup (only one disk on that controller, no raid, no fancy stuff)
the kernel locks after writing ide2: line :( Well, it used to work earlier,
can it be unpatched so it starts working again? :)
Regards, Vladimir
