applied patches 1-2 to #upstream.  minor follow-up comments follow in 
separate emails.
Thanks a bunch for working on this, sata_promise has needed some "love" 
for quite a while.
Any chance you could be talked to becoming "official" sata_promise 
maintainer, by sending in a patch to MAINTAINERS?
One open issue that remains is port enumeration order.  Bug reports 
consistently indicate that the ports are numbered on the board (visible 
to the naked eye) in a different manner than how the chip enumerates 
each port.  According to the bug reports, Promise's driver enumerates 
the ports in the correct order.
