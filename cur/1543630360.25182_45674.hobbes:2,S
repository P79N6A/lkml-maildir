The old Makefile was correct, and the only failing was a namespace
conflict between your fsm.c and fsm.c in ISDN, when CONFIG_MODVERSIONS
are used. The right fix is to rename your fsm.c or to create
fsm_s390_ksyms.c with all EXPORT_SYMBOL's sitting in there.
It is fixed in 2.5 with $(MODPREFIX) in Rules.make.
