I have a rather unusual requirement for notification events.
I've had a brief look at the code but it doesn't look like it would 
cater for it.
Would this allow me to receive a notification when a directory is 
passed over during a path walk?
Could this strategy be adapted to notify an in kernel module?
Or is this overkill for what I'm asking?
