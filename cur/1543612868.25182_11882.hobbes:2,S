This implies that the idle loop will poll looking for work to do.
Is that correct?  Davide's scheduler also does this.  I believe
the current default idle loop (at least for i386) does as little
as possible and stops execting instructions.  Comments in the code
mention power consumption.  Should we be concerned with this?
