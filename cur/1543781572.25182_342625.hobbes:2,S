The dev->dn_ptr points to the DECnet specific portion of a net device which
is allocated in dn_dev.c/dn_dev_up and freed in dn_dev.c/dn_dev_delete when
the net device goes up and down.
So I think you are right in that as far as I can see, its possible for a
net device going down to race with this, but the window of opportunity is
very small indeed (in fact possibly zero?) due to the ordering of operations
in dn_dev_delete where dev->dn_ptr is set to NULL (esentially preventing
any more DECnet packets being received on that device) before flushing all
neighbours and only then releasing dn_db.
Also, Patrick Caulfield is maintaining this code now, so I've added him to
the CC list. Thanks for the report though,
Steve.
