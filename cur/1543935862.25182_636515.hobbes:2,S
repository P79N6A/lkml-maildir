Listening is fine but what are you going to do after you have listened? 
Right, not use port 0x80 but since that's the current idea anyway outside of 
legacy drivers, you don't actually need to listen.
If the quirk-to-0xed or similar was to stay, it's a much better switching 
point than DMI strings but if not, it's not actually important.
