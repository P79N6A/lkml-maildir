ok, I added three sysctl:
andrea@laser:/misc/andrea-athlon > ls /proc/sys/vm/vm_*             
/proc/sys/vm/vm_balance_ratio  /proc/sys/vm/vm_mapped_ratio /proc/sys/vm/vm_scan_ratio

with some commentary in the sourcecode:
/*
 * The "vm_scan_ratio" is how much of the queues we will scan
 * in one go. A value of 6 for vm_scan_ratio implies that we'll
 * scan 1/6 of the inactive list during a normal aging round.
 */
int vm_scan_ratio = 8;
/*
 * The "vm_mapped_ratio" controls when to start early-paging, we probe
 * the inactive list during shrink_cache() and if there are too many
 * mapped unfreeable pages we have an indication that we'd better
 * start paging. The bigger vm_mapped_ratio is, the eaerlier the
 * machine will run into swapping activities.
 */
int vm_mapped_ratio = 32;
/*
 * The "vm_balance_ratio" controls the balance between active and
 * inactive cache. The bigger vm_balance_ratio is, the easier the
 * active cache will grow, because we'll rotate the active list
 * slowly. A value of 4 means we'll go towards a balance of
 * 1/5 of the cache being inactive.
 */
int vm_balance_ratio = 16;
I'm still testing though, so it's not guaranteed that the above will
remain the same :).

ok. Another argument is that by making those sysctl tunable people can
test and report the best numbers for them in their workloads.
Those would be fixed numbers anyways, they're magics, they're not
perfect, they tend to do the right thing, and changing them slightly
isn't going to make a big difference if the machine has enough ram for
doing its work.
