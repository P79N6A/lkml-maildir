Hmm what a coincidence, I was chasing a problem where large page
allocations would fail even though I clearly had enough large page memory
free.
It turns out we were tripping the overcommit logic in do_mmap. I had
30GB of large page and 2GB of small pages and of course cap_vm_enough_memory
was looking at the small page pool. Setting overcommit to 1 fixed it.
It seems we can solve both problems by having a separate hugetlb overcommit
policy. Make it strict and you wont have OOM problems on large pages
and I wont hit my 30GB / 2GB problem.
