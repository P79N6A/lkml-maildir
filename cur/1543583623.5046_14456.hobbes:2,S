Ok, I did some testing again. What I found:
Without crypto: Everything works good!
With crypto:
I used the ciphers: idea,serbent, aes, blowfish(with small patch in
cipher-blowfish send somewhere in the past)
Only 2.4.2-ac8 Material: Everything is ok. 
With  old 2.2-Material:
Encrypted in the way: 
 losetup -e blowfish /dev/loop0 ./test.file
 losetup -e serpent /dev/loop1 /dev/loop0
It works perfect too! :-)
But with old 2.2 - Material stored on DVD-RAM. 
  losetup -e blowfish /dev/loop0 /dev/sr3
  lsoetup -e serpent /dev/loop1 /dev/loop0
it doesn't work.
Just garbage comes out of the loop-device.
Both, the file on the harddisk and the DVD-RAM are made with 2.2.16 an
patch-int-2.2.16.9 and are working
there perfectly. 
I guess that the problem has maybe something to do with the logical
block number.
Well, for me was the HD-File important to work under 2.4 (DB-on it...)
So great thx from me!
Hope my testing will help in some way. (will do some more monday
afternoon)
