Not only that, but on some systems it may never even exist. Which was
the whole reason for my problem in the first place with the workqueue
code.
I haven't tested it, but the patch would appear to work for me. Since
sparc64 doesn't support CPU hotplug, the cpu_possible_map is just a copy
of cpu_present_map. I'll merge it into my tree and give it a run on the
ultra3k.
