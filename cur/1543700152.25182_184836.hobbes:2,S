Ok, 2 reports now.  With Anton off getting married, can you assist
with debugging this (I've tried, and can't reproduce it on any systems
available to me) ?
In include/asm-i386/edd.h, change:
#define DISK80_SIG_BUFFER 0x228
to
#define DISK80_SIG_BUFFER 0x2cc
and see if that helps.  What I'm thinking right now is that 0x228 is
being used by a boot loader somehow (what's your boot loader?) though I can't
yet prove it, and it isn't listed in
Documentation/i386/zero-page.txt.  But Anton showed that the int13
calls the EDD code makes (or even if you remove those) succeeds, but
by writing something into 0x228 the kernel uncompress fails.  I'm
hoping that by moving the buffer to 0x2cc (immediately before the e820
memory map reserved space) that it will succeed.
Thanks,
Matt
