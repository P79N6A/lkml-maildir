Hi, 
I met some problem with radeonfb driver.I use two
graphic cards on my box
PCI:00:0e:0  ATI rage XL (pci)
PCI:01:00:0  ATI radeon QY VE (AGP)
and I use radeonfb as the frame buffer device driver
for ATI radeon. Radeonfb driver are built in the
kernel, not as a module. When booting system, there
are messages like that:
    radeonfb: ref_clk=2700, ref_div=12, xclk=18300;
    cannot map FB;
But if I only use the ATI radeon card and plug out the
pci one, this driver works very well.
what's the problem?
I use redhat 7.2 and kernel 2.4.14 on i386.
In addition to this, I would be glad to know about
configuring the IRQ table in linux.
Thanks in advance,
jing
