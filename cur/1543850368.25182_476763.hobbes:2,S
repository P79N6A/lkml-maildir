I _think_ it doesn't matter much which one is used as on most archs
ext3_set_bit_atomic() is only a wrapper for test_and_set_bit() just like
ext3_set_bit() is. The only exceptions seem to be those archs that use
the generic bitops and m68knommu.

I tried to implement this, but I could not find out how to check at this
point whether a given bit (in the block bitmap, say) needs fixing.
Thanks
