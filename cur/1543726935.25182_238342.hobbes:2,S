We've actually managed to do a fair bit of cleanup already - if you look at 
the gamma driver, there's a lot of stuff in there which used to be shared but 
ifdef'ed out between all the drivers.  The __HAVE_MULTIPLE_DMA_QUEUES macro is 
a remnant of this, but I think you'll break gamma when you try & remove it.
It used to be the case that 50% of the #if hoo-hah was just to try & keep the 
gamma driver working.  I don't know how true this is anymore, though.

Not a great deal changed as drivers got moved to shared/ -- things like 
copy_from_user() got replaced by DRM_COPY_FROM_USER(), etc, but that's about 
as far as it went.  The template abstractions haven't really changed a great 
deal with the introduction of freebsd support.  If anything, code has been 
simplified by moving the gamma-specific code out of the shared templates and 
into gamma_* files.
