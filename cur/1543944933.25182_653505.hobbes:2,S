Changing the commits in git in anyway changes their ID, which has the
same effects as a rebase.
With this idea, Linus only has two choices:
1. pull the entire set of linux-next changes whether he likes them or not,
   because he's going to get them either from the linux-next tree or someone
   elses tree which is based upon that.
2. don't pull the changes, nor anyone elses tree if he hates the changes
   in linux-next.
So really, Linus needs to ack the changes _before_ they go into linux-next.
