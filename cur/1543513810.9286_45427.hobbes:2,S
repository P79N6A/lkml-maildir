   Short of that, here is a parallel-correct method of managing
   include/linux/modversions.h:
   (1) In 'make dep' create modversions.h in just one node at the
       top of the rule tree.  Specifically, do it in Makefile, not
       in Rules.make.
   (2) In Rules.make, go ahead and make modversions.h depend on
       *.ver.  *But do not modify the file*.  modversions.h is shared
       across directories and if you modify a shared file, you will
       race.
   (3) In Rules.make, if modversions.h is out-of-date with respect to
       *.ver, issue an error and tell the user to run 'make dep' again.
   (4) While you are in Makefile and Rules.make, put comments in the
       top of the file indicating your e-mail address and what you
       did to the file.  These files need accountable engineering just
       like any other portion of the source.  Who designed CONFIG_MODVERSIONS,
       anyways?
Suggestion:
Make the rule which creates modversions.h in the top-level makefile, and
then run "make include/linux/modversions.h" explicitly after running the
subsidary makes in the subdirectories (which may now be run in a
parallel file).    
Then you shouldn't need to do (3) above.
