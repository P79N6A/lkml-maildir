I made those Quant-X Alpha's CD's in 1998/1999. ;-)
I included the bench (including source) onto the CD with permission of
Shimizu because there was also an ev6 assembler source included.
Tom Leitner <tom@radar.tu-graz.ac.at> suggested to include the bench
at first.
This bench is very interesting on Alpha because it demonstrates
page-coloring problems very clear...
