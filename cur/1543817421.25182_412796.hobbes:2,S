I think you misunderstood (probably because what I wrote was very
unclear).  What I meant to say was that I wanted to make
CONFIG_INFINIBAND_IPOIB_DEBUG=y, without the option to disable it,
unless CONFIG_EMBEDDED is set.  In Kconfig language, change it to:
	config INFINIBAND_IPOIB_DEBUG
		bool "IP-over-InfiniBand debugging" if EMBEDDED
		depends on INFINIBAND_IPOIB
		default y
Do you still have a problem with that?  The rationale is that we want
the debugging output compiled in (it still needs to be enabled at
runtime) unless the user really really knows they don't want it,
because by the time we know we want the output, it's too late to
recompile to kernel.
