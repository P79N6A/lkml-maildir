Hi all,
I have an application that sends a multicast. 
I am running some applications on different machines(same subnet mask). On one machine I donot receive the multicast (seen through tcpdump). However after adding
>ifconfig eht0 addmulti  
I start getting multicast (again I see through tcpdump )
Still my appilcation does not get multicast. 
Kindly help
Thanks
Girish
