Well I hope that when you do a proper implementation for this issue that 
it takes this into account.  The current implementation doesn't.

The application of active balancing to address your problem in the 
current implementation is essentially random.

Yes.  Thanks for spotting that.

I'd be interested to see the ones that would fail with the corrected 
code.  I can show lots of examples where load balancing fails to do the 
right thing without the smpnice patches so it becomes a matter of which 
are more important.

Sometimes complexity is necessary.  E.g. to handle the limitations of HT 
technology.  In this case, the complexity is necessary to make "nice" 
work on SMP systems.  The thing that broke "nice" on SMP systems was the 
adoption of separate run queues for each CPU and backing out that change 
in order to fix the problem is not an option so alternative solutions 
such as smpnice are required.

Yes, but you are failing to take into account the effect of the other 
tasks on your system (e.g. top) that run from time to time.  If their 
burst of CPU use happens to coincide with some load balancing activity 
they will cause an imbalance to be detected (that is different to that 
which only considers your test tasks) and this will result in some tasks 
being moved.  Beware the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle :-).
