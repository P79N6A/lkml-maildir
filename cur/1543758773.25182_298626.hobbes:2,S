My testing last week or so has been with the latest tar, tar-1.15.1-2,
tar 1.14 and 1.13 had same lseek --verify issues.

I would agree in the lseek sense.  I feel that if there is some bad
behaviour in tar it should be reported to the tar folks to be fixed so
long term things are done correctly and over time the kernel
worarounds can be depreciated.
