Or not.  The necessary protection for this and other driver->probe()s 
would be the device->parent.sem, not the device->sem itself.  There seem 
to be several ways how a driver probe may be entered (adding a device 
when the driver is already there; attaching a driver when the device is 
already there...) and I am not sure whether all these paths take the 
device->parent.sem around the probe.  It doesn't seem to be always the case.
Greg, can you comment on this?
