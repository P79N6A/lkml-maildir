The lock is held thru out swapout(), but it is a shared lock: multiple
swapper threads can own it. There should be no lock-up.
reader: swapper. Reentrancy is not a problem because it is a read-lock,
ie shared. The implementation must starve exclusive waiters (ie a reader
is allowed to continue even if a writer is waiting).
write: everyone who changes the vma list. These functions must not sleep
while owning the ERESOURCE (IIRC the NT kernel name) exclusive.
I hope I have not overlocked a detail,
