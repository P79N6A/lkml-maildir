But could somebody please explain why on earth processes get swapped out
if I turn on DMA transfer, but stay in memory with PIO transfer?
With PIO mode the machine is usable, but slow. With DMA mode,
it takes several seconds, sometimes minutes to get a response
for a keystroke, and this happens regardless of memory size.
