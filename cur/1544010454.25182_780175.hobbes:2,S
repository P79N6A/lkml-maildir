Ah, this is a fix for the new bug by this order.
==
    try_charge()
    commit_charge()
    reuse_swap_page()
         -> delete_from_swapcache() -> uncharge_swapcache().
    increase mapcount here.
==
Because ucharge_swapcache() assumes following
  a. if mapcount==0, this swap cache is of no use and will be discarded.
  b. if mapcount >0, this swap cache is in use.
A charge commited by commit_charge() is discarded by reuse_swap_page().
By delaying commit (means checking flag of page_cgroup).
==
  try_charge()
  reuse_swap_page()
  commit_charge()
==
the leak of charge doesn't happen.
(reuse_swap_page() may drop page from swap-cache, but it's no probelm to
 commit. But as you say, this has swp_entry==0 bug.)

Ahhhh, sorry. ok, swp_entry==0 is valid...Sigh...
I'll revisit this and check how commit_charge() works.
I think checking PageSwapCache() is enough but if not, do somehing other.
(Maybe Nishimura's suggestion to pass swp_entry directly to commit_charge()
 is one way.)

Sorry for complication ;(

It seems that it  will add another complex or unexpected behavior..
I think I can do something workaround.

I'll ask you if I found I can't do anything ;(
Thank you for pointing out!
I'll revisit this on Monday.
