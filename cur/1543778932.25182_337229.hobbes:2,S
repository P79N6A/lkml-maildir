I'm have one gigabit nic with static IRQ (2,000/s)
I have very high CPU load from HTB shaping I think
Now I have near 80Mbit traffic going throw my shaper (IMQ,
two interfaces) and 50-70% CPU in system (now P4 3.0GHz)
So I can't install really powerfull cpu (I don't know which
cpu is really more powerfull)
So I think about SMP
2.4 can't use second (and other proccessors) for
routing/shaping
Is 2.6 do?
