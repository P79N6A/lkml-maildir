It's nice in concept, but I think there are a lot of reasons why this is 
a bad idea:
- "man" doesn't handle it.  It would be another thing if "man" could be 
taught to understand commands like "man cvs checkout" or "man git fetch".
- There is no general way to teach shells etc about it, for tab 
completion etc.
- Makes it harder (but not impossible) to run git from a build directory 
without installing it first.
In comparison, the issue of clutter in /usr/bin is actually a pretty 
small issue, especially with htree.  Most vendors have gone back to 
putting everything into /usr/bin since all variants that involve 
splitting it up seem to be more of a loss than a gain.
