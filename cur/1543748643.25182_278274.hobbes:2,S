This is interesting:
$ lspci -x -s 1f.1
0000:00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82801CAM IDE U100 (rev 02)

The ICH3-M datasheet says offset 0x09 is the Programming Interface
register.  Default value is 0x8A (legacy on both), value here is 0x8E
(legacy on primary, native on secondary).  This mixed-mode setting
is noted as a disallowed combination in the datasheet.
So it looks like my BIOS is screwing me.  Where could/should I fix
this up?
