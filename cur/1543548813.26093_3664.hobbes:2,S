A new patch with Davem's bugfix has been uploaded and
performance seems to be quite a bit better now...

Unless somebody else manages to find a bug in this patch,
this will be the last patch at this feature level and the
next patch will contain a new feature. The new feature in
question will be either the out of memory killer, or Ben
LaHaise's readahead-on-VMA-level code.
(probably the OOM killer since that is a stability-related
thing and the other is "just" a performance tweak)
regards,
Rik
