You make it sound like I have ever done any developement for 2.5.  I
haven't.  Someone else did the port of the aic7xxx to 2.5.  End of
story. 8-)
Unfortunately, I haven't had any spare time to play with 2.5.  I have
faithfully maintained the 2.4 driver and will look at 2.5 once the
time to do so presents itself.
