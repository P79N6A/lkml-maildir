Hi,
I am replying to myself so that people googling for similar problems can find 
the answer.
Supermicro says that the internal driver of the southbridge (and also the 
W83627HF chip) are not useable because the necessary support hardware is 
missing. They say that the P8SCi board has a working watchdog.
	hope this can help somebody someday,
