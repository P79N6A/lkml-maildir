FWIW: I'm also using matroxfb on a millenium, and ever since switching 
from xFree86 4.0 to 4.0.1 my mouse becomes jerky after switching to a 
textual console and then back to X. Restarting X fixes it. Looks like 
an X server bug to me, but given the ongoing palette discussion...
Ah yeah, I'm on 2.3.99-pre9 (smp) at the moment (I know, I know... :-)
