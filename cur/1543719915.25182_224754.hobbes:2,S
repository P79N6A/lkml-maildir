in the full install of FC1 and FC2 the number is zero - and Fedora has
exec-shield which does a couple of things more: it makes the heap
non-executable as well [this broke X], it randomizes the address-space
layout and has a 4:4 VM [which broke the Sun JVM].

we have three mechanisms for this in Fedora:
1) the PT_GNU_STACK flag itself - you can turn executability on/off
   compile-time or even after the fact via the execstack(8) utility
   Jakub wrote. This only affects the stack's executability - if an 
   application assumes a non-PROT_EXEC mmap() can be executed it might
   still break with NX - but based on experience with Fedora Core i'd
   say there's almost no such application.
this method works in 2.6 too, since it supports PT_GNU_STACK. gcc's
PT_GNU_STACK mechanism is very conservative - e.g. if an application
does an asm() then gcc assumes that it might rely on stack executability
and emits the X flag. [applications can then turn this off in the source
if stack executability is not required.] Likewise, if gcc emits
trampolines then the X flag is emitted too. (glibc knows about
PT_GNU_STACK all across - so e.g. if a nonexec stack application
dlopen()s a library that needs stack executability then glibc makes the
stack executable on the fly via PROT_GROWSDOWN/GROWSUP.)
2) via a runtime method: via the i386 personality. So an application can
   trigger the 'legacy' Linux VM layout by e.g doing 'i386 java
   ./test.class'.
this is a hack in Fedora - we wanted to have a finegrained runtime
mechanism just in case. But it would be nice to have this upstream too -
e.g. via a PERSONALITY_3G?
3) via a kernel boot parameter (exec-shield=0)
with the NX patch this becomes noexec=off [the same flag works on x86_64
too]. This method is the most inflexible one, and is a last-resort
thing. (Fedora also has a runtime global switch to turn off the VM
layout changes.)
here's a list of applications that we had to fix/work around in Fedora
when the VM layout changed:
 - emacs _rebuild_. (it coredumps itself during build ... xemacs is OK.)
 - some JDKs. Since they generate code and try to be as fast as possible 
   they tend to rely more on VM details than normal applications.
 - X's module loader assumed that brk was executable. (fixed)
 - Wine. (it implements another OS so it's by definition very sensitive 
   to layout changes.)
most of the breakages were unclean x86-only code that would have broken
if ported over to 64-bit anyway.
old, legacy applications dont have the PT_GNU_STACK flag so they all 
work fine.
