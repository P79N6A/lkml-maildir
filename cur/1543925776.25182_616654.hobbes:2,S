Fixed (extended) in the DaveM's tree (or will be soon - patch was
submitted by Pierre Ynard).
Sorry, others are either driver related (and thus require
hardware to be tested on and maintainers to be kicked in) 
or too obscure (like 2.6.11 bug and weird network problem 
which is undetectible on other systems).
Yes, we suck, but we try to recover :)
