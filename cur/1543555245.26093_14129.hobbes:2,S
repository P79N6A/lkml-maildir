Subject: [PATCH] Attempt to hard link across filesystems results in un-unmountable filesystem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus,
In 2.4-test11 attempting to hard link a file across filesystems (the
link does fail correctly) results in one of the filesystems (the one
the hard link was to be created on) to be in a state such that it
can't be unmounted.
The attached patch fixes this problem.
Chris.
