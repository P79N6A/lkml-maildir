One relatively reliable way would be to add printks to the error
paths again.
You're right it's probabaly related to the non standard return path.
Since it's so non standard i'm not sure you can even trust strace
completely. It relies on the return path and might be slightly confused.
Easiest way to track it down if you know an old kernels which
didn't show the problem would be probably to bisect.
