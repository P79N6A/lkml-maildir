Geez - that's REALLY ugly :-) But for testing I can use it.
It's not bad design - what I'm doing is writing snapshots for VFS as my diploma thesis. And I need to create copy of file before it's changed (copy-on-write). There is no other way how to do it in kernel-space (and user-space solutions like using LUFS are really slow)
Thx,
Libor
