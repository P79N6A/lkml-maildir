No IA64 stuff that I can remember. And there was a presentation on PPC.
But that was planned to be differently with more focus on embedded, 
unfortunately the comittee didn't manage to find more embedded CPU 
people in time.
My personal preference would be to go for a chipset panel this year
instead. Chipsets seem to impact kernels much more than CPUs.
