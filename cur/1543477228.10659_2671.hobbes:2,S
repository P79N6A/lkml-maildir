This is strange. I had it the other way around. The acct tools I had
compiled and used under 2.0 gave funny results on 2.1. This is because
the kernel data structure has been changed somewhere in 2.1. The solution
is to recompile the tools under the kernel you intend to use.
If you have both 2.0 and 2.1 kernels on the same machine you need to
keep two versions of the acct tools (except if there is a new version
that fixes this).
