I have no quick and easy test for that.  
If it's important, I can modify a version of JACK to use SCHED_RR,
instead.
I very much doubt it would make any difference, since we normally only
run one realtime thread at a time.  Each client taps the next on the
shoulder when it is time for it to run, so there is essentially no
concurrency among them.
