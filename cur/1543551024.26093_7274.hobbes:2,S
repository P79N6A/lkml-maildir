Yup. The X server could give back the memory for some cases like the
background without too much hackery.

I agree in principle, though the problem is difficult, as the memory pool 
may get fragmented... Most memory usage is less monolithic than the 
background pixmap.
And maintaining separate memory pools often wastes more memory than it
saves.

Netscape 4.x is hopeless; it is leakier than the Titanic.  There is hope 
for Mozilla.
