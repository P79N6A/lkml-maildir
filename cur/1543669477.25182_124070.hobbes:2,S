Hi,
Stacked driver communication (kernel 2.2.20):
I wrote stacked driver moduls for an measurement system.
The lower driver handles the access to the pci-card.
This pci-card controls a bus-system , like iee488 for example.
This bus controls serveral at96-measurements-cards.
So the upper moduls control these different cards.
If the lower modul receive (from pci-card) an interrupt ,it 
have to  address the corresponding upper modul-isr.
So ,that moduls can read his registers.
I have solve this by ...
The upper modul registered the address from his isr
(and his at96-irq) in the lower modul.
The lower modul can detect wich at96-irq are requested.
The lower modul-isr  jumps in the corresponding 
upper module-isr, can fetch the data and wake up the
process.
I know the possibility to make it with EXPORT_SYMBOL
and use it to access from serveral 
upper-moduls to the lower-modul.
My question is:
It is possible to make this - or doubtful ... , 
if I make it secure (with corresponding 
register- an unregister- functions) that no 
pointer is standing in the wood.  
Best regards Frank Hoeft
