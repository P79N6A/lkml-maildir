I've got a machine which has been dying repeatedly with nothing loged to
the serial console we could see.  The problem was the console would kick
you off if idle for too long.  I managed to keep one it from
disconnecting for quite some time and finally got a panic.  I caught
this:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 8011c560
 printing eip:

 <0>Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
Can someone please tell me what this means or how to figure it out?  The
machine is offline for the next 12 hours unfortunately due to lack of
remote help.  I do have similar machines with the same kernel/hardware
if I need to run any commands against this output.  I don't have access
to any specific files on the machine though.
Thanks,
  Robert
