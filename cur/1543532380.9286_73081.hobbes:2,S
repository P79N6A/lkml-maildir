Hi,
I have a disk that probably has "just the right kind" of badblock. 
Once I hit the badblock, the disk does a few retries until the
scsi-read command times out, and the scsibus is reset. Next the 
read is retried, and timedout and reset again. And again, and again. 
After 10 minutes I reset the PC and tried a different block. Same
result(*), so that disk should be considered a "goner", but still I'd
like the system to report "IO error" within say 60 seconds. I'd prefer
something like "5" seconds, but 60 seconds seems to be like the upper
limit.
			Roger. 
(*) From the log, it seems I let that one run for about 20 minutes
before giving up.
