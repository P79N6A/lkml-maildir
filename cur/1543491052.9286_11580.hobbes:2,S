Not to demonstrate my monumental ignorance (oops, too late!), but what
is that?  I've a K6-2/3D-Now.  Is this something to take advantage of
that?  I know the latest as supports the 3D-Now (had to get it to
compile the latest mpg123).  Is this something to support 3D-Now?
If not, is anybody working on K6 optimization?  Or is it even an issue
in the kernel?
