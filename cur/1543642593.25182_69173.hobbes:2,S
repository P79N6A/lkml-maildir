   So it's a bit of rmap in there.  I'd have to compare with a 2.4
   profile and fiddle a few kernel parameters.  But I'm not sure
   that munmap of extremely sparsely populated pagtetables is very
   interesting?
Another issue is that x86 doesn't use a pagetable cache.  I think it
got killed from x86 when the pagetables in highmem went in.
This is all from memory.
