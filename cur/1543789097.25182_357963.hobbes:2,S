Sounds like the tests are broken.
It also sounds like your patch is broken: allowing partial short writes is 
in explicit violation of the POSIX specs, and breaks the only thing that 
PIPE_BUF _really_ guarantees, namely that writes smaller than that size 
must be atomic.
The _only_ guarantees wrt PIPE_BUF is literally that a write smaller than 
or equal to the PIPE_BUF will always either complete fully or not at all, 
and that a reader will see the write as an atomic packet (ie two writers 
will never have their write buffers interleaved within such a single 
"write()" system call).
How empty the pipe has to be for a write to be able to do so is outside 
the spec, and any code (including LSB tests) that depends on it is broken.
