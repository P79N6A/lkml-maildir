While xmms, launched under Gnome, doesn't skip, ogg123 launch via crond
does.
I have a subscription to an daily audio program that arrives monthly via
CD.  I have a crontab entry which plays each day's program automatically.
Under 2.6.0-test2, there are lot's of skips when the short 2 minute
file is played.
