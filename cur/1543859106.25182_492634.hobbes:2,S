After fixing the problem with the skb headers, we noticed that there
were still problems when scatter gather wasn't in use.  XFS was giving
us bios that had pages with a reference count of zero.
The aoe driver sets up the skb with the frags pointing to the pages,
and when scatter gather isn't supported and __pskb_pull_tail gets
involved, put_page is called after the data is copied from the pages.
That causes problems because of the zero page reference count.
It seems like it would always be incorrect for one part of the kernel
to give pages with a zero reference count to another part of the
kernel, so this seems like a bug in XFS.
Christoph Hellwig, though, points out,

In attempting to find the conversation he was referencing, I only
found this:

If anyone has a better reference, I'd like to see it.
