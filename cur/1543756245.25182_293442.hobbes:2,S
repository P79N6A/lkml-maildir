Okay. You need to provide linux-kernel with the kind of
CD, and the drivers installed to support it.

Of course it should not. However, there were many incomplete changes
made in 2.6.nn and some may involve problems with locking, etc.
For instance an ioctl() call in 2.6.10 occurs with a kernel
lock being held. A lot of CD I/O is handled using ioctl() functions.
There may be an incompatibility (called a race) with certain
things that wait in the driver when the BKL (kernel lock) is
held.

If possible, reboot your system with 2.4.20-or-greater and see
if the CD subsystem behaves properly with a bad CD.
