Oh, I forgot to mention: I use a slight modification to your patch: you
left some functions as "__init/__initdata" functions/data even though they
are should definitely be __devinit/__devinitdata for all the hotplug
stuff. So the thing that works for me has had a global search-and-replace
to replace all "__init" with "__devinit".
If you're testing with just modules, you shouldn't see this effect,
though (otherwise you might get strange oopsen and/or corrupted initdata,
of course).
