   Yes, exactly: if you want to remove the phone, this also
   removes the call. In TCP/IP, this isn't the case. Your
   TCP connections will survive route changes, interface
   removals, etc.
But not a change in IP address :-)  TCP connections are
exactly like VCC's in this regard, the VCC here is defined
as saddr/sport/daddr/dport, and if any of these must change due
to an administrative act, it kills the "phone call" :-)
