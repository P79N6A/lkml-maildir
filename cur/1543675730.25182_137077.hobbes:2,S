I seem to have the same problem, or at least a very similar one.  I
reported it in a message with subject "[OOPS] ide-ops:1262 in
2.4.21-rc3", posted to LKML last Sunday.  You might like to read that
message (it includes a ksymoops'ed panic trace).  I have since then
been able to reproduce with 2.4.21-rc6.  I will try to get a more
detailed analysis today, and post it tonight.
Roland.
