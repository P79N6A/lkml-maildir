One other thing: why O_CANLINK (suggested flag
to open) instead of O_NOLINK?
It seems to me that for the vast majority of
open()calls, you don't care whether the open
fd can be flink()ed to, because you don't pass
the file descriptor to an untrusted process.
A bit set to eliminate that capability is
the new feature one might need for security reasons with an implemented flink() call
available to programmers.
Seems like leaving "can be linked to" as the default setting and having an explicit flag
to prevent that would be more efficient.
