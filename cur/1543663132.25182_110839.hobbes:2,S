It seems that the mjpeg stuff will be in the wrong place when it starts 
being used by non-DVB modules.  I see the two (DVB and mjpeg) as 
distinct entities - like ethernet drivers and ipv4.  (DVB drivers should 
let you change channels and whatnot, mjpeg drivers should allow you to 
decode data streams from any available source.)
