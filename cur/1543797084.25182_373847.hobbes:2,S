Assuming that the processes have _some_ method of synchronisation, then
I cannot see why it shouldn't be workable. Come to think of it, it might
even be possible to use O_DIRECT to provide that synchronisation (use
O_DIRECT to set a "lock" on the page, then modify it using mmap). 
Whether or not there are people out there that actually _want_ to do
this is a different matter.
