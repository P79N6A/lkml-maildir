You may want to see if any deliberate seg-fault actually gets
delivered. Try to read *(0).  If that works (seg-faults), then
there may be a problem with some boundary condition on paging.
I can't duplicate the problem here. You can also try to trace
the code execution to see if it falls into some user-space loop.

    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
