Erik:
One more thing you forgot!
Before you run around ranting about DMCA and CPRM and making suttle legal
threats.  Everyone here knows who put it on the line to gain control of
technology to prevent Content Protection Recordable Media from covering
the storage industry wide.  That is correct it was me.  I was the one and
only person ever to stand up and have a position to help everyone here to
take control of technology.  While all of my hard work was destroyed by
the brain-dead of the EFF by causing it to go underground.
So lets be real clear about your wild swings of DMCA, because the irony
will be back to haunt.  Threaten to strike me down with DMCA, what a child
you have become.
So this is where it goes ... Mighty Linux kills usage for business with
lawsuits like the MPAA and RIAA.
GPL == DMCA, this is the brush you swing paint well dude.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
