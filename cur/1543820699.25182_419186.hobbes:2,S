Subject: kernel pause during boot?

All,
I am trying to figure out why a kernel is pausing, until a key is typed on
the (serial) console, whenever a kernel module fails to load.
A module is failing to load (doesn't matter why- can't register a device b/c
the minor number is already taken), and the boot seemingly pauses until
a key is hit- or at least, the console seems paused in some manner.
I waited a long time and there appears to be no timeout.
A second module once failed to load for a different reason and the behaviour
was the same.
I don't know what statements that ran in the module, as a result of the 
failure
to load, that might explain the apparent pause.
Hopefully what I've  described will trigger someone's memory?
TIA!!!
