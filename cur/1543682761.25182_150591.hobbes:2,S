Hi all,
I sometimes get this strange bug with my new system (Dual Xeon 2.4Ghz on Tyan 
Tiger motherboard; Intel E7505 chipset): During boot it just hangs with the 
following message: (The last few lines only, as I had to write it down on 
paper...)
...
Intel machine check reporting on CPU#1
CPU1: Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 2.40GHz stepping 07
Booting processor 2/6 eip 2000
Initializing CPU#2
masked ExtINT on CPU#2
ESR value before enabling vector: 00000000
ESR value after enabling vector: 00000000
calibrating delay loop... 4771.02 BogoMIPS
CPU: Trace cache: 12K uops, L1 D cache: 8K
CPU: L2 cache: 512K
CPU: Physical processor ID: 3
Intel machine check reporting on CPU#2
CPU2: Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 2.40GHz stepping 07
Booting processor 3/7 eip 2000
and then it hangs. The only option is the reset button. (This particular one 
was with kernel 2.4.21-xfs, but looks similar with 2.6.0-test1)
This does not happen always, only sometimes. (like 25% of all boots)
Is there anything I could to to help debug this?
Thanks in advance,
	Florian
