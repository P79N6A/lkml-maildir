Presumably the controller is permanently requesting an
interrupt.  So as soon as you enable the IRQ, you lock
up, taking infinite interrupts.
It's always seemed a bit fishy how we enable the IRQ before
initialising the socket controller.
Try moving the block of code which requests the IRQ down
so that it comes after the call to cardbus_register().

move it down to here.
