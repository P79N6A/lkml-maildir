I agree that it would be adding unnecessary complexity, just to meet the
accounting needs.
Thinking of it more, this requirement to "group tasks for only accounting
purpose" may be required for other resources (mem, io, network etc) as well?
Should we have a generic accounting controller which can provide these
various resource usgae stats for a group (cpu, mem etc) by iterating thr' the 
task list for the group and summing up the corresponding stats already present 
in task structure?
