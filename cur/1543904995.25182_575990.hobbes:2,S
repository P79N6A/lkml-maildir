As I'm sweeping through arch code etc... preparing the ground for the
proper mmu_gather surgery, I've been thinking about the way to deal with
that per-cpu page list and finally came up with the idea that the best
we can do is around the lines of trying to allocate the list via gfp,
and if that fails, fallback to a (smaller than now) per-cpu. I'm
reworking the interfaces such that the higher level code doesn't have to
care whether preemption is enabled or disabled at a given point.
Ben.
