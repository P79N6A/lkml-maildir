Yes, that would look cleaner. Perhaps something like PACKED_IF_NEEDED so
that it's clear that it's not allways defined to __attribute__((packed))?

OK, I'll use a "proper" (not playing with some local variables) global
macro like Arnd suggested in this thread.

I wanted to limit the argument passed to compat_alloc_user_space
somehow; 64K is probably not the best idea, but some upper bound is
needed, isn't it? OK, if we can get around without any conversions at
all (see below), then these constants can go away.

Oops, silly mistake. Thanks!

Yes, I'll use _NATIVE_IOC here (also in other places as you pointed out).

Well, I didn't want to touch other files but xfs_ioctl32.c so that the
patch has a higher chance of being accepted ;-) But of course if you
think that patching the implementation to be aware of the compat ioctls
is acceptable, then I can do it.

I'll try to clean up the XFS_IOC_FSBULKSTAT part first...
Thanks to all for their comments and suggestions! I'll send updated
patches later.
