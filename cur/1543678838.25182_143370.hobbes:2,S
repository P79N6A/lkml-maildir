DDR memory works very much like single data rate, except that data is 
transferred (in whichever direction it's going) on both edges of the 
clock, thus doubling the transfer rate.  The memory does not switch 
between reading and writing as you describe it.
I believe registering is for reliability.  Data is transferred one clock 
cycle later but reduces signal loading.
