One option is to reduce HZ, by e.g. applying
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/patches/2.6/patch-config-hz-2.6.3
and selecting CONFIG_HZ_100.
I did this originally to prevent clock slowdown on a 486 during
heavy disk I/O, but at least one person reported that it helped
his PIII as well: that could very well have been a chipset or
#SMM BIOS issue.
