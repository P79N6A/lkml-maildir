Linux shouldn't encourage the use of equipment that violates RFCs, in
this case, RFC 739.
The correct way to deal with it, is to contact the maintainers of the
site, and ask them to fix the non conforming equipment.
If the problem is caused upstream, by equipment out of the
site's maintainers' control, it is their responsibility to contact the
relevant maintainers, or change their upstream provider.
John.
