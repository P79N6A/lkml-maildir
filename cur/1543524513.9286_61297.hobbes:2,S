The location of the boot logo in the kernel image has nothing to do with
such being a config option.
If the boot logo is separate from the ELF kernel image itself, that
makes it easier for external programs to modify the boot logo without
having to recompile the kernel.
I am imagining a patch which would add something to the final stages of
the link process:
	cat vmlinuz.gz mybootlogo.signature mybootlogo.img > foo
	mv foo vmlinuz.gz
Obviously this is simplified greatly but you get the idea.
