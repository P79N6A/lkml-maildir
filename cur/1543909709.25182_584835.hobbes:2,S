It wasn't an oops, just a warning.

To track this down, you might try building 2.6.23-rc3 with 
CONFIG_USB_DEBUG enabled.  Then retrieve the dmesg log after the 
keyboard stops working and post it.  You probably ought to CC: the 
maintainer of the HID core layer as well (and you can trim the existing 
CC: list).
