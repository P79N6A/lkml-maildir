No, please don't down this legal rat hole. It would cause bullshit like
people submitting dual licensed patches to the scheduler or GPL only
patches to the ath5k or ACPI code.
Instead, add a section to Documentation/SubmittingPatches that clearly
states that all changes to a file are licensed under the same license
as the original file. I don't feel legally qualified to write the correct
wording.
