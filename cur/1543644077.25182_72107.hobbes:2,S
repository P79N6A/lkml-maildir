I expect that caching userspace and not pagecache would be
a reasonable choice.

Well if it's a really big read then bypassing the CPU cache on
the userspace-side buffer would make sense.
Can you control the cachability of the memory reads as well?
What restrictions are there on these instructions?  Would
they force us to bear the cost of the aligment problem?
