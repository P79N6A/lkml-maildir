How would that work? I mean, what will a tool that cares about a block
event do? It will run a fdisk/parted -l /udev/sda to figure out what partitions
are there (just to skip an extended partition sda5, as example) and
finds no media. That tool will never run again on sda, unless a new
block add event comes in. So some sort of polling is required for that
class of devices.
If we create sda1 - sda15, you mean a mount /udev/sda15 /mnt is supposed
to fail with -ENODEV instead of -ENOENT?
