Hi again,
thanks for applying the recent DVB updates to 2.6.10-rc1.
Here comes another patchset with 5 patches that in short does the following:
- rework debug print logic in av7110 driver
- various fixes in the dvb-core
- one new driver named "Terratec CinergyT2/qanu" for an highspeed USB2 
DVB-T receiver
- general overhaul of the dibusb USB DVB driver -- there are more clones 
of this card out there than we expected
As usual, the details are at the top of each patch. IMO all changes are 
non-intrusive and can be applied safely.
Please apply.
CU
Michael.
