Subject: IDE Panic (2.4.19-pre3-ac3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have not yet checked to see if this happens with older kernels,
however I have a reproducible panic on attempting to access a DVD drive,
this one was from trying to mount a normal data-CD.
I am using the ide-scsi layer, but can test without it if needed.
Attached is the decoded panic, however it is not a complete panic due to
the length of the call trace, resulting in not having the code line.
(I used the printer for console output, and finally stopped it after 17
pages of call trace pointers.)
Also attached is the .config used for the kernel, and the dmesg output
from booting.
I will try without using the ide-scsi layer and with older kernels in a
few hours, if any additional information is needed please let me know.
Thanks.
Zephaniah E. Hull.
(Debian Developer.)
P.S.: The -c2 part of the kernel version just indicates compile 2, not
additional patches.
