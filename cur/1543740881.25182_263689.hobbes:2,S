Generally nobody because new error codes are almost always a mistake in
the first place especially when they don't appear in standards so no
application will correctly or sanely handle them.
You should use existing codes IMHO. Lets see
EKEYEXPIRED		-	ETIME (ETIMEDOUT ? ENOLINK ?)
ENOKEY			-	ENOENT
EKEYREJECTED		-	EILSEQ / EMSGSIZE / EPROTOTYPE ..
EKEYREVOKED		-	EREMCHG / ESHUTDOWN
And now I can use your key stuff with an existing C library and in LSB
compliant or cross platform code and give more information. If you look
through the kernel history we've almost never ever added an error code,
adding them just causes compatibility pain for everyone
