Subject: kernel 2.2.0-pre4 killing aix/adsm server

i'm running adsm v.3 native linux client.
with kernel 2.1.131 and prior it works fine, with 2.2.0-pre4 the aix machine
dies (i'm trying to get a better description, the operator says "had to be
rebooted"). is this a known "aix feature" ?
i'm using gcc 2.7.2.3 if that matters. here is my kernel config.
the network card is a new 3com 905B cycline rev 30, and to get 100 mbit 
i have to load it as module with options=20.
will try now 2.2.0-pre6, and i'm willing to compile every kernel from 
131 to 2.2.0pre4 if this can help to locate the bug ...
thanks for your help.
