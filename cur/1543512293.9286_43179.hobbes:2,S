Sorry to interrupt the devfs "discussion", but... has anyone besides me
noticed hard locks when using sb audio under 2.3.18ac10? (I;m steering
clear of 2.3.19 for now).  I get hard lockes (no oops or anything in the
logs) when playing sound on my fujitsu p133 laptop, ess chipset. I can
try and chase it down myself but i'd rather not duplicate work.
