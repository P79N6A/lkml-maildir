Something is trying to access a second sound card.  As you only have one
soundcard, alias them to off.
I have an AWE32, and the relevant bits of conf.modules are:
# synth0 is the awe synth
alias synth0 awe_wave
# synth1 is the sb's built-in fm synth.
alias synth1 adlib_card
# first sound card is the sb
alias sound-slot-0 sb
# no second sound card
alias sound-slot-1 off
options adlib_card io=0x388
options sb io=0x0220 irq=5 dma=1 dma16=5
# make sure we load an sfbank for the awe synth
post-install awe_wave /usr/bin/sfxload  /usr/lib/sfbank/synthgm.sbk
