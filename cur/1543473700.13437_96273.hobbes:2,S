The offsets should be ok - an alternative fix for the DMA related oops
has been added to the 2.2 version of ide-floppy.c but there shouldn't
be any issue in having both fixes in the code.

There was a bug(let) in the patch - some junk from testing got left in
the format unit ioctl.
Attached is a corrected patch which should apply OK against 2.2preX
(although there will still be a 3 line offset for some of the hunks)
but if you don't want to have to back out the original patch and apply
this one then change the end of the FDFMTUNIT part of the switch
statement in idefloppy_ioctl from
	idefloppy_create_format_track_cmd (floppy, &pc, &f);
        idefloppy_queue_pc_tail (drive, &pc);
	return idefloppy_create_request_sense_cmd (&pc);
to 
	idefloppy_create_format_track_cmd (floppy, &pc, &f);
        return idefloppy_queue_pc_tail (drive, &pc);
