This has been a doubt for a couple of days, and I am wondering if this
one could also be cleared. When you say kernel stack, can't be resized
a)       Does it mean that the _whole_ of the kernel is restricted to
that 8K or 16K of memory?
b)        Or does it mean that a particular stack for a particular
process, can't be resized?
c)         And for that matter how exactly do we define a kernel stack?
TIA
