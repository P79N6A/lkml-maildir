Well, you *are* specifying vastly different priorities.  The question is 
how many nice=20 tasks should it take to interfere with a nice=-19 task? 
  If you've only got a 100:1 ratio, 100 nice=20 tasks will take ~50% of 
the CPU away from a nice=-19 task.  I don't think that's ideal, as in my 
mind a -19 task shouldn't have to care how many nice=20 tasks there are 
(within reason).  IMHO, if a user is running a CPU hog at nice=-19, and 
expecting nice=20 tasks to run immediately, I don't think the scheduler 
is the problem.

I, like all users, can live with anything, but there should be a clear 
specification of what the user should expect.  Magic changes in the 
function at nice=0, or no real clear meaning at all (mainline), are both 
things that don't help the users to figure that out.  I like the 
exponential base because shifting all tasks up or down one nice level 
does not change the relative cpu distribution (i.e. two tasks 
{nice=-5,nice=0} get the same relative cpu distribution as if they were 
{nice=0,nice=5}.  An exponential base is the only way that property can 
hold.
Now, perhaps implementation issues may prevent something like the 
"1.2589" ratio rule from being realized, but I'm not sure we should 
throw it out _before_ we know that it's actually a problem.  This is the 
same sort of resistance that the timekeeping code updates faces (using 
nanoseconds everywhere instead of "natural" clock bases), but that got 
addressed eventually.
