Thanks for your reply.
I am interested in where can find the linux kernel spec. file, and where Red
Hat add the smp string?
Where the uname command extract the kernel version information(eg:
2.4.2-2smp or 2.2.16)?
I means from which file, or use which system call?
I am a linux driver writer, and I am writing Makefile now. I hope the
Makefile can install driver 
to the correct directory automatically (user run 'make install').
The linux driver modules always put  in /lib/modules/<kernel_version>/...
before (in kernel 2.2.16),
but in kernel 2.4.x, the path change to
/lib/modules/<kernel_version>/kernel/drivers/...
I don't know where to get the kernel_version information. I need some help.
Thanks!!
may I use uname? I worry that the driver will install to incorrect path, and
user will complain it.
thanks!!

No, it's correct: the Red Hat RPM is build from the kernel.spec file which
adds the smp string to the version.

Because you've made an assumption that holds no value.  2.4 kernels rely
on CONFIG_SMP instead of __SMP__.
