Thanks very much for the patch, I can see how that piece of code could
well be causing the problem.
Between my message and your reply, someone else came up with another
clue for me and I found that enabling DMA for the drive appears if not
to fix the problem at least to avoid it fairly well.  I think using
DMA for most of the transfers makes it less likely that the lockup
will be triggered.  At least this gets me out of the immediate bind.
It's a busy machine and it's a little painful to keep rebooting it.
I'm going to put an identical one together for testing.  When I've
done that I'll test the patch to destruction.
It will be a couple of weeks before I can get to the bench to do it,
but then it should only take a few hours to be sure it's a good fix.
I'll certainly get back to you with the results.
Thanks again for the pointer.
73,
Ged.
