Hi
When playing mp3-files off of a cd with joliet (or joilet?) extensions 
in 2.3.18ac8, I get the strangest messages in my syslog. The messages
go like:
Sep 30 20:33:16 hex kernel: _isofs_bmap: block >= EOF (3028, 6096129)
They appear about 50 times when xmms is at the end of a file. The only 
difference between the messages is that the first number at the end is 
incremented once for each message.
The cdrom player is an IDE device
