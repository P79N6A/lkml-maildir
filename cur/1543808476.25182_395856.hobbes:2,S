It depends how you interpret the standards and what you think sensible
behaviour would be, I guess (obviously our current MS_ASYNC is not
technically buggy, we're arguing about whether or not it is suboptimal).
But given that there is an MS_INVALIDATE (I interpret mmap + MS_INVALIDATE
should work as write()), and that one would _expect_ MS_ASYNC to closely
match MS_SYNC, I think MS_ASYNC should start writeout straight away.
The fact that we've historically had a buggy MS_INVALIDATE implementation
is a non argument when it comes to the interpretation of the standards.

I wouldn't argue that because I don't agree with your contention. I
argue that MS_ASYNC should do as much of the work of MS_SYNC as possible,
without blocking.
 From the standard (msync):
   Description
     The msync() function shall write all modified data to permanent storage
     locations...
     When MS_ASYNC is specified, msync() shall return immediately once all
     the write operations are initiated or queued for servicing;
It is talking about write operations, not dirtying. Actually the only
difference with MS_SYNC is that it waits for said write operations (of the
type queued up by MS_ASYNC) to complete.
So our current MS_ASYNC behaviour might technically not violate a standard
(depending on what you consider initiating / queueing writes), but it would
be akin to having MS_SYNC waiting for pages to become clean without actually
starting the writeout either (which is likewise inefficient but technically
correct).
[snip smooth writeback]
That would be a nice thing yes, but again I don't agree that MS_ASYNC
is semantically equivalent to write()
