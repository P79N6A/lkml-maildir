:)))))))) It'd be like this if you let UDMA/66 enabled on a 40-wire
cable. What I meant is that after a *single* CRC error the speed would be
lowered to the next lower step (UDMA 100, 66, 44, 33, 16) and if even
UDMA/16 doesn't work, then fall back to PIO.
PS. You have damn bad modems if they behave like that. Mine just lower
the rate until the rate of retrains is acceptable. But yes, I have to
admit that Morotola 3265's tend to be expensive, yes.
