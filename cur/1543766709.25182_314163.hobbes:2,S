OK.
Can you please define "global state"?
In SAS, when the domain changes, the controller(s) connected to the
domain get notification and pass it to the discovery process, which
will run again.
Overall, since the discovery process gets (internally) a "picture"
of the domain out there, it would be appropriate to show this
"picture" to the user.
