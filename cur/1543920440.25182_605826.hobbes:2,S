OK, I have no objection, but please apply the fixes the le16 problem as
suggested by Pete and Greg first. Also, you will probably receive more
comments, and/or criticisms from further reviews. This is normal and
expected. You just have to fix your code so that it can be merged.

If this is going to be the commit message, please reduce lines to less
than 70 chars, and also enumerate the supportd devices and the one you
performed the tests with. It helps a lot when users encounter problems.
Also, if you did not (I forgot to check), please ensure that the adutux
maintainer in 2.6 is CC'd.
Last but not least, please remove the "KERNELS/" path component from
your next diff.
Thanks,
Willy
