And if one this applications misbehaves, he might want to know what is 
actually going wrong. A tracing mechanism could tell him e.g. why xmms 
sometimes stops and with the right visualization tools even an user with 
basic technical knowledge could give some more precise feedback. You 
wouldn't just get reports with "if I do X, the system feels weird".
I'd really like to see some tracing infrastructure in the kernel, as it's 
also a very useful tool during kernel development, when trying to find 
some weird problems or finding perfomance bottlenecks, where printk or 
kgdb isn't much help.

kprobes are a nice option, but it would be a nightmare (especially 
regarding portability) if any project had to rely on them.
kprobes are already very complex conceptually, it may be a requirement to 
debug a binary kernel, but otherwise some simple hooks are preferable.
