You can already cause incorrect checksums on the wire just by passing a 
partly unmapped address (the zero-the-rest exception handler in 
csum_copy_generic in i386 forgets to add in the carry) 
I do not believe it is a big deal, packets with bad checksum are not really
a problem (you can usually do other better DoS that do not need it)
