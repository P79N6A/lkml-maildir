        Debian doesn't have a kgcc, it's a gcc272, which is described as
follows:
"This is the old version of the GNU C compiler's C part. It should only be
used for backward compatibility purposes."
        i don't have the gcc272 package installed under Debian, and i use the
standard compiler that comes with Debian (2.95.2) and it works fine on Intel
and Alpha for compiling 2.4 and 2.2, so there :P

	This whole stupid 'kgcc' thing is yet another in a long line of really
dumb things that RedHat has done and it's just another reason i'm glad i
switched from RedHat to Debian.
