Hi all,
 best regards.
 I was trying to debug my multi-threaded program on a RH6.0  2.2.12,
using gdb 4.18. Inspite of my calling detach, gdb doesn't let go of
threads when they have to die and leaves a plethora of defunct threads
in the wake.
The program works fine without gdb. Help!
Thanks,
Aadi.
