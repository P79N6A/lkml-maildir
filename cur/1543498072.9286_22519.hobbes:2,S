   I don't know if SBUS<->SBUS DMA actually works, there are some bits
   for it but have never tried, but PCI<->other PCI should definitely
   work.
SBUS<-->SBUS on the same segment works, I've tried it.
One thing which probably does not work is PCI<-->PCI on the same PCI
controller yet different PBM segments, at least sun PCI docs describe
it this way.  It seems the PCI controller cannot handle if it sends
out a transaction to the system bus which is addressed back to itself.
