As far as I can make out the correct answer is "none", and then fix the
actual problems in the boxes that need these workarounds. They break as
much if not more than they cure.
Please boot your system without the workarounds (ie a current kernel).
Then do lspci -vxxx and save that to a file. Then go back to a kernel
with working networking and email me and/or the list that result.

routing and try to work out why it might not be working and how we got
where we did.
