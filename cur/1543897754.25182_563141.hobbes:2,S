Where does it state that there must not be a barrier?  I see it saying
the source must accompany the binary, under 3a.

Indeed, but why does it matter?  In a CD is not the preferred form for
making modifications either.  In fact, in the CD, you can't modify it
at all.  What's *behind* encryption is the source code, along with the
binary it accompanies.

That's the spirit.  But where does the *letter* of the GPL state it?

I've already explained that the inability to modify what's in the CD
is not a restriction imposed by whoever recorded the bits in there as
a means to stop you from making modifications.

If your desktop is sufficiently similar, and the kernel binaries are
identical, why should I not expect the same result to arise?

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Imposing further restrictions is the issue.

If it is imposed by the licensee, yes, it is indeed.

Exactly.

It doesn't state "you must distribute sources in modifyable media", it
says "you may modify your copies, and the distributor must not have
imposed restrictions on your exercise of this right"
If you can't modify your copies because others get in the way, too
bad.  If you can't just because the distributor stops you, there's a
GPL violation.

Please read the license instead of assuming you know what it says.
You clearly don't.  See above.

Let's just say I honestly hope you are right and I'm wrong.
