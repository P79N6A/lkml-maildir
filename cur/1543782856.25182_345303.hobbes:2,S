Hi Chris,
In addition to the patch I sent a few minutes ago, there's one last reference
to verify_area left in xtensa. It's in arch/xtensa/kernel/entry.S, and I'm 
going to need your help to get rid of that one since that code is over my head
and I assume that the naive approach below would just break it : 
diff -upr -X ./linux-2.6.13/Documentation/dontdiff linux-2.6.13-orig/arch/xtensa/kernel/entry.S linux-2.6.13/arch/xtensa/kernel/entry.S

So, could you come up with a working patch and push it to Andrew along with the
one I sent a little while ago, so I can push my verify_area removal patches? Or
you can just sign off on my previous patch if it's OK, and send me one for 
entry.S and then I'll push the entire thing onwards if you prefer that.
Thanks in advance.
