We have a large number of a very small number of machine types.  The
OS images installed are identical, and the bioses should be identical
between each individual machine types.
Since the number of machines reporting this error are pretty small, I
think it's unlikely to be power management, or anything like that.

I'll mention it to the people who handle the replacement of hardware, but
from the sounds of this and Dick's e-mail, it's most likely hardware of
some sort or possibly overheating.  They can decide if they want to try to
figure out which component is causing the problem, or if they'd prefer to
just replace the faulty machines completely and worry about tracking the
component later.  We have plenty of spares in the warehouse.
Thanks for the help,
Greg
