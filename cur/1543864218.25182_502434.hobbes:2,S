Big "me too" here. I use this board to run "workstation and home samba services"
and it seems that under stress, the connection gets lost. Can't put my finger on
the when/what/why too.
I get the feeling though that when I use the ethernet-device locally _and_ it
gets used through samba (externally) the problem is more likely to occur.
If anyone gets this, please tell me. As David says: too nice a board to have
this problem :)
Thanx,
Jeroen Roodhart
