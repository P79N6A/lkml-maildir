Yes, GNU tar is acting insane. Given that GNU tar is the most widely
used tar implementation (at least for extracting linux sources), why is
the kernel packaged to exploit this insane behaviour?

I merely asked if it was on purpose. In my point of view, it's wrong to
deliberately expose people to such big security threads.
That said, the kernel source is actually the only thing I extract as
root, mostly because I think it's weird to have symlinks in /lib/modules
point to my user's home directory.
