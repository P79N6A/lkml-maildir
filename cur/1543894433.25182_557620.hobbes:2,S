TiVO made it so, that's the difference.
I'll give you that it's not so much about making changes per se, or
even installing them, as it is about running the modified versions for
any purpose.

Is the BIOS code under the GPL?

That's exactly what makes for the difference between the spirit and
the precise legal terms, and why GPLv3 is fixing these divergences.

It doesn't.  The license can't demand the software, or modified
versions thereof, to run.  The only thing it can demand is that
licensees don't impose restrictions on others' abilities to do so.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion

I think you're missing what 'spirit' means.  It's guidance, it's not
the legal terms.  And it's precisely because the implementation (the
legal terms) failed to meet that design (the spirit, encoded in the
preamble) that the license needs patching.
