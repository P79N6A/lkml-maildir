But we don't - not in the case where it's overlapped some other area 
with the MMCONFIG region. We saw a case of this on some of the Intel 
boards, where the MMCONFIG is a 128MB area at 0xf0000000, and when 
sizing the BARs on a PCI Express video device with a 256MB region, it 
ended up being located momentarily at f0000000-ffffffff, which 
overlapped the MMCONFIG area. That caused MMCONFIG to stop working, so 
apparently on that chipset, PCI Express devices connected to the 
northbridge have a higher decode priority than the MMCONFIG area.
If the BIOS is so screwed up that this becomes an issue, I don't think 
we can sanely try to use the table, since we can't anticipate all the 
potential problems that might result.
