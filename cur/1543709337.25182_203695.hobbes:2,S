You should believe it... It was a combination of a power failure and
some bad disk sectors. Maybe it was just a kernel bug, after all, as
this happened with 2.5 kernels: during kernel bootup, the kernel invoked
XFS recovery but it failed due to media errors.

It was exactly one disk block, at least that's what the low-level HDD
diagnostic program for my IBM/Hitachi laptop drive told me. In fact, the
HDD diagnostic was able to recover the media defects.
That could have been one of those very improbable cases, but I lost the
entire volume. Neither the kernel nor XFS tools were able to recover the
XFS volume. However, I must say that I didn't try every single known way
of performing the recovery, but recovery with ext2/3 is pretty
straightforward.
As I said, it could have been a kernel bug, or maybe I simply didn't
understand the implications of recovery, but xfs_repair was totally
unable to fix the problem. It instructed me to use "dd" to move the
volume to a healthy disk and retry the operation, but it was not easy to
do that as I explained before.
