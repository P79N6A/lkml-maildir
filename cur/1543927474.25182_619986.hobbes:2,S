Hello Eric,
This fills a need I had to get the current TID in a Java program,
so I'm very interested in this change. OTOH, how will someone
not reading LKML discover that the current TID is now in
/proc/self and that it was not always the case?
I would put my 2 cents in /proc/self/task/self, this way TGID are
always in /proc and TID in /proc/TGID/task.
