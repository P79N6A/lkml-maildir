That seems like a good approach.  I'll incorporate it into my v6 patch,
and send out an update.  Thanks.

cookie_hash is always called within NET_RX_SOFTIRQ context so I believe
preemption will always be disabled by __do_softirq().  So there
shouldn't be a need to use get_cpu_var/put_cpu_var, somebody correct me
if I'm wrong.
