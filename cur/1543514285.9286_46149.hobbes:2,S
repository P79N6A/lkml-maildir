Hello!
First, sorry for my bad english.
I have posted this question for some weeks in this ML
and some NGs, but i got no answer thats help.
I have an older ISA PnP Soundcard (Terratec Maestro 32/96)
with cs4232 chipset. When i try to play mp3 or wav files, the
sound dies after some sec. or min. with this error in /var/log/messages
"Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?".
I have tried the cs4232 driver as modules and compiled into
kernel ("Persistent DMA buffers" is enabled)  with all IRQs and DMAs,
also with the ALSA drivers, but nothing works. :(
The error occurs on all 2.2.x and 2.3.x kernels, with kernel 2.0.38
i have no problems.
In the last week some peoples wrote in a german linux NG, that they
have the same problem.
thx
Bruno
