Unfortunately, that corrupts filesystems by default on devices like
olympus c-750 digital camera:
* when USB is powered, olympus unmounts its filesystem, and goes into
mass storage mode.
* when USB is unpowered, olympus mounts it back.
So you have mounted filesystem on linux side and suspend. That powers
down the usb and camera mounts the filesystem automagically... then
linux resumes, and state of in-memory caches does not match real
filesystem state...
[Now, olympus uses VFAT and probably will not write to the filesystem
unless you take a picture... with mp3 player, I'd expect mtime to be
updated on the playlist files...]
