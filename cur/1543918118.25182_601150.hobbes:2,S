I don't have any objections to this per se...  a lot of other subsystems 
do this too, and I can certainly see a potential need.
But what about object lifetimes?  If a controller is hot-unplugged, does 
anyone need notification to destroy dynamic objects, or does controller 
cleanup take care of that?  If a device is unplugged, where should a 
controller driver do its ->private_data cleanup?
This is /not/ a NAK, just a request to make clear the lifetime rules and 
procedures...
