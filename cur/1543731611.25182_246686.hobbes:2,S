OK, exactly which drivers were you using to do this? When I had the
interface brought up in win2k-server with the bcmwl5.sys driver I was
seeing every few hundred milliseconds a batch of say 12 2-byte reads on
the register space to check status...

Hrm, you're sure those variations aren't trivial? Although theres lots
of checks, I would have thought they would just be stuff like "card A
supports X, Y and Z features"?
The approach that makes the most sense to me is get 1 card working to
the point where it sends/receives packets, then look at the binaries to
see what the variations are, and how they apply to what cards and just
go fill in the blanks...

I just need to improve logging support in my pciproxy patch and setup a
2nd machine with a working wireless card, then I can start in earnest.
Also, you mention DMA and sending/receiving packets, exactly how much
progress have you made so far?
