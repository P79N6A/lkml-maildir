Then all you need is the bus/device listed in /proc/pci. A simple script
could convert the information from there into the format you evidently want.
There is still no reason to look at the chipset, since it can't tell you how
slots are labeled on your cases.
This will work until you happen to put a PCI Expansion unit on one of the
machines in order to get more slots. :)
