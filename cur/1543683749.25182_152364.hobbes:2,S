I'd just like to say "BRAVO SIR!" I am glad to see you doing this, and I 
support your actions 100%.
Anybody's right of freedom of speech ends when they force the unwilling 
to listen - this troll was -10, Offtopic. He was not talking about the 
kernel, any development of interest to the kernel, and I for one am glad 
he is getting bounced.
Let him post his drivel-scribblings on Slashdot, along with goatse.cx, 
the porn trolls, and the *BSD is dead trolls.
