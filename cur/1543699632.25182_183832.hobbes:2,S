Every notebook from thinkpad 560X up has produced some kind of
cpu-load-related-noise. You'd have to throw out quite a lot of
notebooks...

PS: Jean, can you try how high you can get it? You might want to go to
24kHz so that no human can hear it, or to 100kHz to be kind to
cats. At ~1MHz you'd be even kind to bats :-), but it is probably
impossible to get over 200kHz or so. Still it might be funny
experiment.
