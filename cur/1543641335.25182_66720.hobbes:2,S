Yesterday I was compiling some things with gcc 3.1.1.  When compiling
a rather large file with lots of optimizations, gcc was kill by the
OOM killer, even though I have 768 MB of ram and most of it was free.
Repeating the compilation succeeded.  GCC did use ~250 MB or so, but
that shouldn't be a problem.
What could be causing this?  A bug?  Kernel version is 2.4.19-rc3 with
superpage patch on an Alpha 164SX system.
