The most appealing thing to me was rm -f /dev/shm/.IPC* :-) So I
should make a patch to ipcrm to allow multiple segments (and
wildcards?).
You could not create SYSV shm segments with open, but you could delete
them with rm and list the with ls.

No, this was never possible. It was only a fs interface to local
kernel objects (and still is).
