Part of the problem is that the PIT timesource cannot account for lost
ticks, thus we cannot strictly conform to the
monotonic_clock()interface. 
So either we just return (jiffies_64 * TICK_NSEC), and just have an
exception to the rule, or the hangcheck watchdog needs to know what to
do when monotonic_clock always returns zero. 
Joel: Do you have a preference?
