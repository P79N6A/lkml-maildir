Not much. We have 9 #ifdef's and all trying to resolve the conflicts with 
new function prototypes which is difficult to replace with defines or 
inline functions. Perhaps, you'll have an idea to solve this problem.
For us, it's very important to have only one code base for all kernels, 
but on the other hand, we're trying to leave the 2.2/2.4 kernel code 
specific parts separate in our CVS repository if possible.
