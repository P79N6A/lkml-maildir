In i386 architecture, there are five timers as candidates in the
selection of "cur_timer." I feel among the five only two types can be
used as Kernel base timer, HPET and PIT. Kernel base timer is the
timer trigger timer_interrupt() periodically. Namely, the timer
installed on IRQ 0 in i386 architecture.
Is the above understanding correct? Particularly I want to confirm
which timers can be used as Kernel base timer.
Thanks.
