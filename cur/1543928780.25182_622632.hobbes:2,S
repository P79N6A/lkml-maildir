We ran pktgen overnight on 2.6.23 with patch 1 and 3 applied (patch 2
not needed on .23 it seems) and it was stable at about 1.5Gbps bi-directional
using 1500 MTU sized frames.
We'll run some more tests with user-space TCP & UDP today, but it looks good
so far.
Perhaps these patches should be considered for .23 stable as well?
Thanks,
Ben
