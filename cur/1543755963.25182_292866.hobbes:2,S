Shouldn't be too hard I think.

In that case they'll all point to the same memory and I/O space.  On the 
machines I coded it on, each bus has its own space.

We might have to add more arch code in that case, but I thought it might be 
easiest for apps if they could just open the space for the bus they're 
interested in and it would be routed correctly.  I think that'll be ok so 
long as two apps aren't trying to do stuff on the bus at the same time.

Depends on your platform.

Ditto since the number of spaces depends on the platform.

This interface just deals with the whole legacy ISA space, not just VGA ports.  
I guess some chipsets will do VGA only or split them up?
