Subject: [PATCH] input/spi: add ads7843 support to ads7846 touchscreen driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/20/52

Add support for the ads7843 touchscreen controller to the ads7846
driver code.
The ads7843 support has now become almost trivial since the last
rework.
