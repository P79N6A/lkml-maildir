Since we have already established that I downloaded python from a
python.org (1.52) mirror instead of from a distribution, I don't know
how much
this (still) applies, but here are my comments on the tk interface (and
then curses interface) of cmlconfigure anyway.  Some of these items
may be out of your control (at least without a lot of extra work),
but they are generally unfriendly and a nuisance IMO.
tk interface
-----------------------------------
1.  The initial/opening box (window) size cuts a menu line in half.
2.  If I enlarge the main/primary box size and then go to a sub-menu
and return to the main menu, it's back to its original (fixed) size, not
to the size that I changed it to.  And the main menu is (currently)
small enough to fit on one screen window, without using any scrolling/
slider bar, so I should be able/allowed to do that if I (any user) want
to.
3.  From the main menu, if I slide the slider bar down so that I can
see File Systems, click on File Systems, click Back to the main menu,
the portion of the main menu that is displayed is only the top N lines
of it, and does not include File Systems.  If I'm configuring in the
area of Character Devices and File Systems, I have to move the slider
down to that part of the main menu so that I can click on them
over and over again.  Instead, when I click on Back, the same lines
of the parent menu should be displayed that were displayed when I
entered the sub-menu.
4.  I don't know what causes this, but sometimes I can click to a
sub-menu and then (a) can't adjust its size, (b) can't move its box,
and (c) it's title line (at top of the box) is no longer
highlighted, even after I click on it.  I can still successfully
click on File, Navigation, and Help.  For some reason,
selecting the USB Support menu has caused this 2 times now.
curses interface
-----------------------------------
1.  In a long menu (longer than fits into one xterm screen of any size),
after changing the value of a config option, the list is (apparently)
redrawn, beginning and ending wherever cmlconfigure wants to begin
and end.  It would be "the right thing" to leave the beginning and
ending displayed lines as they were before the option was changed
instead of them jumping around at will.
Also, with the patches that I sent to you earlier today, I'm ready
to "certify" that the USB subsystem is working as expected.
