I somehow doubt that the HPET patch itself is the culprit. In fact, the
reason it shows up on git-bisect is probably because without it HPET
functionality is not enabled on the platform. So the problem could really
be anywhere in the HPET-driven timer infrastructure.
Frans, could you try out the -hrt patchset from Thomas Gleixner and see
if that works? Also, what ICH does your platform have? ICH3 or ICH4?
Cheers,
