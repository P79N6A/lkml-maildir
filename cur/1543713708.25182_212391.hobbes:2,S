Can I have more details? All LISPs I know manage
memory by themselves as well as the one I use. They
allocate memory pool, create a list of free cells in
it and that's it. What is the problem? Yes, cells in
the free list are not contiguous, it's a list.

I use a subset of big lisps (Common Lisp should I
say?). All function are described in manual which goes
with my system. And I'm not going to run some
previously created LISP programs. So exact
compatibility is not an issue. At the same time if a
person wants to understand what is CAR or CDR - there
are different sources of information available except
manual I provide (which is reference, not a LISP
textbook).
