If I understand what you're doing, there appears to be a race after
"add_wait_queue(&WAKE_LIST)" and before "xchg(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE,
&current->state)" where "wake_up(&WAKE_LIST)" may have executed and set
our "current->state"...
...so, maybe I'm confused, but it looks like you may end up with either
"TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE" or "TASK_RUNNING".
This is quite independent of the use of "xchg" to set "current->state" in
the list for CPU1.  That is arguably semantically equivalent to any old
store into "current->state".
I'd want to be sure that any changes to our "current->state" were made
before "add_wait_queue(&WAKE_LIST)" to be sure no such race was possible.
So, the safe thing for CPU1 seems to be (again, assuming I've understood
correctly):
	current->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
	add_wait_queue(&WAKE_LIST);
	if (inode->i_state & I_LOCK) {
		schedule();
			/* this function only returns if current->state
			   is TASK_RUNNING */
	}
