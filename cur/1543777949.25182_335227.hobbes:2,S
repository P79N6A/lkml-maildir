1/  That explains "what."  How about "why?"
2/  The patch does not apply cleanly.  It looks like some tabs
are messed up, but I'm not sure about it.

3/  The patch should be made against a more recent kernel version,
like 2.6.13-rc3 or 2.6.13-rc3-git4.

I wouldn't think that the EXPORT_SYMBOL() is needed.  That just
makes it visible to modules.  Not being 'static' should be enough
to make it visible to other built-in-kernel files...
so, did you try it without the EXPORT_SYMBOL()?

Those last 2 lines should line up with the lines above them.
However, the last 2 lines use only spaces and not tab(s),
which is incorrect.
Basically, fix your email client and justify the patch.
