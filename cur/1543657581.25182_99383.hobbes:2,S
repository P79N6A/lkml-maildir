This needs some more thought about how this would work, and exactly what
we'd achieve by doing it. I think this is only going to work if it's a
2-way link, fully automated - I'm not keen on creating a situation
with two disjoint sets of data. Having access to bug data at checkin
time sounds useful to me, but not if that data doesn't get fed back up
to the main database.
Fully automated links would have to be done very carefully to avoid
screwing things up - having a agent going wild logging stuff at high
rates doesn't sound fun to me. If you only needed to edit some seperate
BK field we added to the database for a reference, that would seem at
first thought to be a lot easier and safer.
I'm not sure how other people feel about exporting stuff into bitkeeper
type-licensed products ... if the non-BK people like Alan and Andrew, and
the other people who've done lots of the work in the DB like Dave and 
Randy,
and the OSDL are OK with it, then I'd be willing to help. If they object,
then probably not. Personally, I'm not opposed to using non-free software,
but I find the fact that BK licensing changed after it had been adopted
extremely unsettling ... the merge / diff-viewer tool looks cool though ;-)
