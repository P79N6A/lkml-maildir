Hmmm, I don't like your array thing (also in v.I of the patch),
limiting us to <n> possible root devices, where n==8.  A better
approach might be to iterate over the root= arguments when mounting.  I
know why you used the array -- easier to code.
One potential problem with the patch is that you have changed behavior
some people are relying on.  If you use 'syslinux' to boot, for
example, the SYSLINUX.CFG file can define a default command line
including root=.  Then you can augment that line at runtime by typing
in your own command line.  Your patch makes it impossible, in this
situation, to override the default root device from the syslinux
command line.  A kludge to make it work again would be to process the
root devices in reverse.  That would be ugly and unintuitive, though.
