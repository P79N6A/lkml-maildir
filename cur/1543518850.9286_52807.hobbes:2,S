I think the reason is that the kernel bootp code is really obsolete.
It will probably go the same way as kernel rarpd sometime in the future..
Doing it by a small user mode program in a initrd is much more sane.
Near all modern distributions rely on initrd now anyways.
BTW, when sending linux kernel patches always use diff -u
