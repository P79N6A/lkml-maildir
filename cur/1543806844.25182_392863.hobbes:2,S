I was unaware of any serious use of PCMCIA reader cards therese days, as 
you note the CD shows up as an sd device. I have a laptop which might 
have a card slot, if it takes CD I'll pull one from my camera and try it 
there instead of the USB reader.
The question is still why not make all devices look like SCSI, and use 
one set of drivers and a bit of glue. Redhat used to use ide-scsi by 
default if my memory serves, and the overhead wasn't an issue even back 
on my 1st Linux laptop running Slackware on a Thinkpad 486-25 (the fat 
one, not the 486-16 -;).
