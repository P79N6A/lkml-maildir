Hi
I've noticed mcelog with weird content:
MCE 0
HARDWARE ERROR. This is *NOT* a software problem!
Please contact your hardware vendor
CPU 1 BANK 128 TSC 57976afd
STATUS 88380100 MCGSTATUS 0
MCE 0

CPU 1 BANK 128 TSC 53e61034
STATUS 88370100 MCGSTATUS 0
I'm running T61 - 2GB - in this directory
/sys/devices/system/machinecheck/machinecheck1
I could only see  bank0ctl ... bank5ctl - so where is bank 128 ?
(as there are no time stamps, I could hardly guess how often this happens)
Is it kernel bug or chipset bug ?
Should I start to worry about the stability of my machine ?
