Not really. Kref seems pretty light and loosely coupled with the 2.6
kernel. There just appears to be a C file (and a .h of course).

I'm having problems porting the KObject* and Work Queue infrastructure 
to the 2.4 kernel. Any ideas if anyone has tried this port?
(Correction: * => I meant KThread)
Sorry about that!
