i'm not assuming anything - this is the per-process overhead.
processes have well-known RAM overhead associated to the size (and
fragmentation) of their virtual memory space, primarily caused by
pagetables. My suggestion triples this cost [where pte chains double the
costs], but leaves the scaling factor and generic characteristics the
same.
