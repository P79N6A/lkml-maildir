Joern already suggested moving this out of line and into a function (as it
was before) to avoid repeating string constants.  In that case the
function, file and line from BUG aren't useful.  We now have this, does it
look ok?
void gfs2_assert_i(struct gfs2_sbd *sdp, char *assertion, const char *function,
                   char *file, unsigned int line)
{
        panic("GFS2: fsid=%s: fatal: assertion \"%s\" failed\n"
              "GFS2: fsid=%s:   function = %s, file = %s, line = %u\n",
              sdp->sd_fsname, assertion,
              sdp->sd_fsname, function, file, line);
}
#define gfs2_assert(sdp, assertion) \
do { \
        if (unlikely(!(assertion))) { \
                gfs2_assert_i((sdp), #assertion, \
                              __FUNCTION__, __FILE__, __LINE__); \
        } \
} while (0)
