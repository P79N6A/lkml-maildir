More trivia.  Rad50 actually allows 5 characters per 32-bit word.  The 50 is
actually 050 in octal (ie, 40 decimal), and allows you to have all 26 english
letters, 10 digits, a null, and 3 characters.  At this stage, I don't remember
what the precise encoding is, or what the additional 3 characters were (I
suspect different systems used different characters).  One of the first systems
I worked on professionally (Data General RDOS) used RAD50 in their object file
format.
