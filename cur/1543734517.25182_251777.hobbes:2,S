- Why is it that user mode has to have knowledge about the layout and
number of debug registers?
- Why is it that (on i386/x86-64) one can't, say, set a byte-range
breakpoint on TASK_SIZE - 1 (whatever this may be good for)?
- Why is it that (on i386/x86-64) one can't set 2- or 4-byte-range
execution breakpoints, but one can (on x86-64) set 8-byte-range ones?
Thanks, Jan
