That would be a good idea.

That's wrong to do.

Why would it be any different from what we have today with the
usb_register_notify() function?  You could change that to be:
	bus_register_notify(struct bus_type *, struct notifier_block *);
and then just pass in the proper bus type that you care about.
And yes, you will have to export those bus_type pointers, but that's ok,
some of them already are there.

Like everything except PCI?  :)

Ick, I'd like to say that this is a pretty bad thing to do.  If you need
that, then just statically link the bus into your code, or make your
code a module and it will depend on the usb core.  I don't know...
Remember, we didn't add a type identifier to the struct device for a
reason, comparing the string of the bus type is not a good idea (for
USB, it will get you in trouble, because two different types of devices
can be on that bus, who's to say other busses will not also have that
issue?)
I think you need to re-evaluate exactly what you are needing to do
here...
