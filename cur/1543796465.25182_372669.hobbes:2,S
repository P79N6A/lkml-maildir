No!  This isn't (for now at least) a fix.  It's a nuke.
I don't want that "cpuset-change-marker-for-relative-numbering.patch"
going to Linus, because I am hesitating whether I even want that
"feature".
I want to nuke it now.  You might see it again, fixed up, or you
might never see it again (I doubt you'll miss it ;).  I don't
know yet.
Yes - the collisions resulting from removing this patch are easy to edit,
if that fits your style.  If you hadn't removed the useless silly
zero initializers, I would have in my next set patches.  It was on
my todo list, thanks to an earlier comment of yours.
So ... not E ;).  What's your preference now?
