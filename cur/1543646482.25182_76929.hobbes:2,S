I can't get it to compile for me.  ide and serial both bomb out.  I'm
compiling as a module for both of these (I was going to test on an nfs
root/netboot machine and I modularize EVERYTHING! =)
If you want my .config and errors, I'll send them.  There was a few things I
changed in the source to get it to compile (serial was ok after removing an
#if test) and ide had unresolved symbols (ide being a few ide modules)
I'm not at that machine at this time and have no access to it (but will
later today).
