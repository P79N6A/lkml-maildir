It does indeed, so just one final clarification. wc(1) is not part
of the C standard - ISO 9899 does not talk about command line utilities
at all. The relevant standard is POSIX; IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition
says, in
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/wc.html
-c
    Write to the standard output the number of bytes in each input file.
[...]
-m
    Write to the standard output the number of characters in each input
file.
[...]
RATIONALE
[...]
The -c option stands for "character" count, even though it counts bytes.
This stems from the sometimes erroneous historical view that bytes and
characters are the same size. Due to international requirements, the -m
option (reminiscent of "multi-byte") was added to obtain actual
character counts.
