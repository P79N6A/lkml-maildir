There's the blunt-force method: Buy a new LCD device.  That's not 
entirely a joke; the information you have provided so far indicate a
fairly high probability that your device is broken.  (Although a new 
device might also be broken in exactly the same way...)

I was going to suggest that something might be going wrong with the
data toggles.  But if that were the problem then cycling the power on
the device would definitely have fixed it.
When you get these errors, do you exit from the hidmon program and 
restart it?  Do the errors still occur after restarting?
My earlier suggestions remain: Use CONFIG_USB_DEBUG and usbmon.  
However without knowing what requests the device will accept and what 
its responses ought to be, it will be very difficult to debug this
problem.
