Well I need the range check for a different piece of code (init_memory_mapping())
For that a range check is definitely needed and the existing code there
also does an (although quite fishy) range check. The DEBUG_RODATA case
 is also handled correctly there because DEBUG_RODATA is applied explicitely 
using pageattr later. 
You have not commented on that at all so I assume it's ok for you.

In try_preserve_large_page()? No because it only checks the first page.
In all other cases (in the existing code; my patchkit adds a new case 
in mm/init_32.c) it always only checks single 4K pages so the only
overlap case would be sub 4K. For that there can be no split up.
