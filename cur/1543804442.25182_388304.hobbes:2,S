When is the last time this worked?
The ACPI git patch has not changed since 2.6.15-mm1,
so if it worked there, then the failure was provoked
by some other change.
If you can test the ACPI patch in isolation, that may help.
You can snag it from here to test it without other mm changes:

Presently the latest is against vanilla 2.6.15, but a 2.6.16-rc1
patch should be coming out shortly.
thanks,
