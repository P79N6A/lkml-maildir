Hello,
On VIA-Rhine ethernet chips that give errors like:
Jan 13 19:35:46 epia kernel: eth1: Oversized Ethernet frame spanned multiple
buffers, entry 0x4 length 0 status 00000600!
(for all 16 entries)
Setting the mtu to a lower value than 1500 appears to help (tested at 500,
and 1000 is in progress).
Could this give a hint to the cause of the bug?
Kind regards,
Udo
