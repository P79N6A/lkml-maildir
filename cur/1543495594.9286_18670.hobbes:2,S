I think we might want to change the kernel's behaviour
to include the following things:
- don't flush if:
	- there are less than X dirty buffers &&
	- we haven't recently read from the disk
- flush if:
	- there are more than X dirty buffers ||
	- we issued a read from the disk more than
	  Y and less than Z seconds ago ||
	- the dirty buffer is FAR too old
	  (say, an hour or so)
cheers,
