Just to chime in here, I've replaced my Quantum Fireball ST 3.2gb twice.  It's 
still broken.  I get all sorts of:
scsi0 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 380768, scsi0, channel 0, id 1, lun 0 Test Unit Ready 00 00 00 00 00
whenever I do something disk-intensive (other error messages show up when data
gets corrupted on the drive which happens every so often).  CD-Rom on same 
controller/cabling is fine.  Swapping the order of the two and changing which 
one does termination doesn't help.  Adaptec BIOS detects bad blocks on the 
hard drive when I tell it to scan the drive, but reassigning the block gives 
me a timeout error.  All the previous drives have acted this way too (start
out fine for about a month or two, then start acting up).  It could be the
cable, but I don't think it is.  *shrug*  Don't think it's a kernel thing
because Win95 and the Adaptec BIOS program give me problems with the same hard 
drive and it happens for me on all the linux kernels I've used on this machine 
(2.0.32 to 2.2.0-pre8)
(Adaptec 2940UW/QUANTUM FIREBALL ST3.2S Rev: 0F0C)
Hope this is helpful to someone,
Daniel Drown
