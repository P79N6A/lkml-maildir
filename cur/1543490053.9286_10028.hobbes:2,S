Hi all,
I'm running 2.2.2 clean +devfs.
Here's my problem:
Connect zip
I insmod:
parport
parport_pc io=0x378 irq=7 dma=3
ppa 
sd_mod
Then use my zip
rmmod in reverse order
disconnect zip
Everything is dandy
Go home (this is my pc at work) leave pc on (I always do ;)
Come back to work:
Then I have an oops on my screen. Typing still works however aftyer
doing the enter for my loginname the system just hangs. Only remedy
reset. Didn't do a ping test I must admit.
This has happened twice and those we're the two mornings after I use my
zip. Mornings when I
haven't used my zip the day before are fine. Also notice that I've used
my zip 2 times sofar.
So maybe it's a coincedence but I don't think so.
I have the oops + System.map + modulesymbols in a tar for someone who
wishes to take a look, but I thought it is to big to attach to the list
;)
This is on a:
vxpro mb with cyrix p233mmx
64mb ram
2 hd's on primary ide
1 cdrom on secondary ide
and most important:
an advansys scsi controller as scsi0 installed as module with a cdwriter
attached
Drop me a mail if you want the oops or have got a clue anyways please cc
reply's I'm not on the list.
Regards,
Hans
