Well, here it is:
HARDWARE ERROR
CPU 1 4 northbridge TSC 89cfb4725b17 
  Northbridge Chipkill ECC error
  Chipkill ECC syndrome = 7014
       bit32 = err cpu0
       bit45 = uncorrected ecc error
       bit57 = processor context corrupt
       bit61 = error uncorrected
  bus error 'local node origin, request didn't time out
      generic read mem transaction
      memory access, level generic'
STATUS b60a200170080813 MCGSTATUS 4
This is not a software problem!
Is this some sort of mem error?
Thank you for your help
