Wouldn't calling sbrk(0) help?  I don't know if the Haskell run-time
ever shrinks the data segment, if not, it could just be called at the
end.  Or a `strace -e trace=brk darcs ...' might do.  But I guess darcs
has other VM usage that doesn't show in this figure?  Does /proc/$$/maps
if running under Linux help?
A consistent way to measure would be handy for observing changes over
time.
Cheers,
Ralph.
