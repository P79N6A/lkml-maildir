The answer could be as simple as the fact that Linux might be trying to
write to the exact memory location that is bad but Win2k has not.  It might
also be that he in fact DOES have problems with win2k but is unaware of it,
that location might be used for data storage rather than program execution.
All I can say is this ... I have never used Windows on our production web
farms and Linux 2.4 appears to work just fine will many different sizes of
memory ... all greater than 128MB.
