It is usually better to have multiple small partitions for performance and
reliability, but this is more work to administer.

The current (0.0.5b) ext3 code is doing pretty good, and if you use
metadata-only journalling it is about as fast as ext2.  I still wouldn't
use this on a production system where data loss is fatal, although I
have never had any data loss or filesystem corruption because of ext3.
