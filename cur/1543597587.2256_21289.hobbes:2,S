I take issue with the word "properly".  We have bastardized our FS design to do it.  NFS should not
be allowed to impose stable cookie maintenance on filesystems, it violates layering.  Simply
returning the last returned filename is so simple to code, much simpler than what we have to do to
cope with cookies.  Linux should fix the protocol for NFS, not ask Craig to screw over his FS
design.  Not that I think that will happen.....
