This doesn't look like it will do as much good as you think.  The problem
is what to do when something run by some *other* UID needs a page - you need
to fix the code to preferentially steal a page from a 'crashalot' process.
And at that point, what you probably want instead is a global per-UID RSS
limit.  This looks like a job for a CKRM resource class controller rather than
a hack to the swap code.
