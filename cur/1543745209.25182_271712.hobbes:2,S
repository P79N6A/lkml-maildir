i have released the -V0.7.28-0 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from the usual place:
	
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this is a fixes & latency-reduction release.
Changes since a -V0.7.27-3:
 - made the UP-ioapic code a bit more conservative again - maybe some of
   the lockups are related?
 - removed the BKL from the sound code in a cleaner way and
   removed the quite fragile 'negative ->lock_depth' code. Much less
   intrusive than i originally thought, and much cleaner as well.
 - more fixes to the wakeup-timing logic, 4 false positives fixed in
   total, mostly related to new-task-wakeup not accurately starting the
   tracer.
 - fixed the mmx-memcpy related latency reported by Florian Schmidt and 
   others. Also turned off the MMX/SSE ops in the RAID code, which 
   can introduce similar latencies.
 - kgdb fix from Bill Huey
 - knfsd shutdown with-BKL-held fix
 - highmem compilation fix
 - profiling related crash fix
 - implemented 'direct-path' rescheduling to further reduce scheduling
   latency: the kernel will now in most cases go from try_to_wakeup()
   into the scheduler directly without re-enabling interrupts ever again
   (and thus not giving irq handlers a window to increase latency). This
   is also the final fix for irq nesting and irq-stack recursion.
 - turn off sync wakeups on PREEMPT_RT -> they are latency generators
to create a -V0.7.28-0 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
