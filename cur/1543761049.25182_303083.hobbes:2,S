I'll bet it does work fine on IA-64. If it didn't, you would
be unable to load the kernel or load an executable.
I know it works for PowerPC. You'll need an isync instruction
of course. You may also want a sync instruction and some code
to invalidate the cache.
Setting up the page content should be a 1-time operation done
at boot. Check your processor manuals as needed.
