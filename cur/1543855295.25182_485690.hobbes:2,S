Not anything I feel strongly about, but I don't see it that way.
mapping_gfp_mask() seems to me nothing more than a pragmatic way
of getting the appropriate gfp_mask down to page_cache_alloc().
alloc_inode() initializes it to whatever suits most filesystems
(currently GFP_HIGHUSER), and those who differ adjust it (e.g.
block_dev has good reason to avoid highmem so sets it to GFP_USER
instead).  It used to be the case that several filesystems lacked
kmap() where needed, and those too would set GFP_USER: what you call
a constraint seems to me equally a property of the surrounding code.
If __GFP_MOVABLE is coming in, and most fs's are indeed allocating
movable pages, then I don't see why MOVABLE shouldn't be in the
mapping_gfp_mask.  Specifying MOVABLE constrains both the caller's
use of the pages, and the way they are allocated; as does HIGHMEM.
And we shouldn't be guided by the way tmpfs (ab?)uses that gfp_mask
for its metadata allocations as well as its page_cache_alloc()s:
that's just a special case.  Though the ramfs case is more telling
(its pagecache pages being not at present movable).
