Subject: [PATCH] Fix reparenting in exit.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The code that attempts to reparent the children of a dying task to
another task in the thread group has a nasty race condition.  Since
it is called early in the exit sequence, the task it picks as the new
parent could also be exiting.  This has the effect of reparenting the
task to a zombie, and eventually the parent pointer will point to
re-used memory.
Given that this feature is unused and would be difficult to fix, I
believe it should be removed entirely and it should just always reparent
to init.
The patch to change this is below.
