You don't have to do anything manual.  git-apply handles these fine.
From my introduction post (00/18):
	There are several renames in here, so GIT can apply them but maybe patch
	can't.  (If there is a switch to git-format-patch to produce something
	more universally applicable, I haven't found it.)
Thanks,
Roland
