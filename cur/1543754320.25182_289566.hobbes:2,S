That's a little more extreme than what I'm seeing, so it may be
something else, but my firewall box needs rebooting every
few days. It leaks around 50MB a day for some reason.
Given it's not got a lot of ram, after 4-5 days or so, it's
completely exhausted its swap too.
It's currently on a 2.6.10-ac kernel, so it's entirely possible that
we're not looking at the same issue, though it could be something
thats been there for a while if your workload makes it appear
quicker than a firewall/ipsec gateway would.
Do you see the same leaks with an earlier kernel ?
