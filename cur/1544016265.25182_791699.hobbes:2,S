This a behavior that was unintended by the implementer, wasn't
requested by application writers, isn't present on other Unix systems,
and isn't specified by the standards.
It isn't an extension.  It's an accident.
And the fact that such accidents happen more often than necessary is
the real problem, rather than the fact that this API in particular is
inconsistent with expectations.

Right.  And this fact is why, while I incline to think we should fix
the interface, I don't feel strongly about it.
