Hello,
I recently did some test and found out something interesting about the b44 
problem I wrote earlier. 
The problem is the following:
When I use my BCM4401 with the b44 driver in wireless-dev I get very high ping 
times looking like this:
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1863 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=855 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1855 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=855 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=1854 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=6 ttl=64 time=854 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=7 ttl=64 time=1851 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=8 ttl=64 time=851 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=9 ttl=64 time=1851 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=10 ttl=64 time=851 ms
I also found out that shortly after I boot my laptop and log into kde ping 
times are not that high but start to increase very quickly:
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=53 ttl=64 time=2.19 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=54 ttl=64 time=2.22 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=55 ttl=64 time=2.20 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=56 ttl=64 time=2.20 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=57 ttl=64 time=18.6 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=58 ttl=64 time=1268 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=59 ttl=64 time=268 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=60 ttl=64 time=1268 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=61 ttl=64 time=268 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=62 ttl=64 time=6.08 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=63 ttl=64 time=268 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=64 ttl=64 time=1264 ms
64 bytes from 172.30.10.1: icmp_seq=65 ttl=64 time=264 ms
After some time digging around I found out something really interesting. When 
I play some music ping times are immediately lower. If I stop playing music 
they are back to the same times as they were before.
I guess that there is a problem with interrupts so I post some information of 
my system in hope it will be usefull.

This problem did only happen with wireless-dev (checkout this evening) and 
with -mm kernels I used some time ago for testing. Currently I'm running 
2.6.22-rc4 that works perfectly fine and doesn't show that problem.
