Uptime sounds good so far.
I am not convinced my v2 apic patch is a great overall improvement, I am 
thinking v1 apic, is safer for now. 
Having said that
Ian Kumlien currently has an uptime of
1 day, 15 hours +
on v2 patches but with the apic delay timeout increased from 600UL to 800UL.
He has a Barton core - see below.

I don't think it is necessary to put the delay in all apic acks - I just tried it 
to see if it worked and have not yet put my code back the way it was. 
My hard lockups went away with the original v1 apic 
timer delay patch anyway.
Please note in that (above) posting I write that I stuffed up the #ifdefs
in my v1 and v2 patches and adjust code accordingly. Patches worked 
but were only testing on the first config item after #ifdef
apic code should have had
#if defined(CONFIG_MK7) && defined(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_AMD74XX)
ioapic code should have had
#if defined(CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT) && defined(CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC)
Brief summary at this point
1) 2? reports are in that latest award bios with "C1 disconnect" set to "auto?"
 may remove need for apic ack delay patch and still keep cpu thermo managed
2) apic ack delay v1 patch seems safe for all cpu cores but introduces a small
 delay of about half the time of an XTPIC access on each apic timer interrupt
3) apic ack delay v2 patch seems safe only on barton cores and gives more debugging
 info and wastes less time than apic v1 patch
4) io-apic v2 patch gives more debugging info but functions same as io-apic v1 patch
