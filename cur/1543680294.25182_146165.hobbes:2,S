Personally, I've always thought we were kidding ourselves by not doing
the error checking you describe.  From my somewhat-narrow perspective of
network drivers and the libata storage driver, you have to deal with
atomic allocations _anyway_ ...  so why not make sure IOMMU overflow
properly fails at the pci_map_foo level?
