We're going in circles.  Linus requested that the explicit type arg be
added.
IIUC Dave's original patch (and I just want to say that Dave is my
hero for pushing this) looked vaguely like the existing code in
include/linux/netfilter.h.  He's mentioned it before but noone
bothered to read it, so I'll quote for you:
/* From arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:

/* Two signed, return a signed. */

#define SMIN(a,b) ((ssize_t)(a)<(ssize_t)(b) ? (ssize_t)(a) : (ssize_t)(b))
/* Two unsigned, return an unsigned. */
#define UMAX(a,b) ((size_t)(a)>(size_t)(b) ? (size_t)(a) : (size_t)(b))
#define UMIN(a,b) ((size_t)(a)<(size_t)(b) ? (size_t)(a) : (size_t)(b))

#define SUMAX(a,b) ((size_t)(a)>(size_t)(b) ? (ssize_t)(a) : (ssize_t)(b))
#define SUMIN(a,b) ((size_t)(a)<(size_t)(b) ? (ssize_t)(a) : (ssize_t)(b))
Cheers,
Rusty.
