Intentionally. The base tree doesn't support page cache removal AS callbacks
so cannot support the ideal behaviour. The other rounding bits for the
tmpfs stuff are I think all fixed in 2.4 by Hugh's stuff, but fixing 2.5
tmpfs is an ongoing seperate project.

On the benches I've run I can't see any difference whatever the
accounting mode I am using.
