A lot of places also use Sequent machines.

I disagree with that.  It isn't raid and it isn't hot swap.  It IS high
availability.  All of the companies list above have clustering products.
The idea is that you have several machines that are connected to the same
physical drives (not via NFS, but shared SCSI bus or fibre channel).  In an
OLTP type environment, if one system fails, the other system can take over
its workload.
You will find that big companies that have big databases need 24/7 uptime
even if one system fails.
Even more important in a cluster is the ability to do a rolling upgrade.
Shut one system down while the other one stays up.  Upgrade the OS on the
system that you shutdown and reboot.  Do the same thing on the other system.
It's (in theory) the no-downtime OS upgrade.  Can Linux or Windows do that?
I know that Solaris, Digital UNIX, and Sequent PTX can.
