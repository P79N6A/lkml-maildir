Me either (not exactly).

The reason I ask is that we went through the pains of a separate
realtime RQ in our MQ scheduler.  And yes, it does hurt the common
case, not to mention the extra/complex code paths.  I was hoping
that someone in the know could enlighten us as to how RT semantics
apply to SMP systems.  If the semantics I suggest above are required,
then it implies support must be added to any possible future
scheduler implementations.
