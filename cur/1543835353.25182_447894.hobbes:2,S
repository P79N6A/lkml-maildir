None of the filesystems other than reiser4 have any interest in using
plugins, and this whole argument over how it should be in VFS is
nonsensical because nobody but us has any interest in using the
functionality.  The burden is on the generic code authors to prove that
they will ever ever do anything at all besides complain.  Frankly, I
don't think they will.  I think they will never produce one line of code.
Please cite one ext3 developer who is signed up to implement ext3 using
plugins if they are supported by VFS.

Most users not only cannot patch a kernel, they don't know what a patch
is.  It most certainly does.
