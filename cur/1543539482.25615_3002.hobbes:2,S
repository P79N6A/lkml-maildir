Andre cool off, so the patch doesn't make it into the official 2.4.0, no
big deal that is why there is a 2.4.1 and >. I think the original
reasoning was lack of testing, well, maintain the patch against the
remaining 2.4.0-test kernels and the offical 2.4.0 and how many others it
takes to get sufficient testing.
Ok, so some people disagree with your reasoning for the way the patch
works, that happens everyday. The kernel as a whole is better for it. That
being said, I agree with having a flash jumper on the drive but most
drives don't have such a jumper so limited protection is software will be
helpful. The software protection is not the fix all, end all though. So
please keep producing your patch, if you think your doing the right thing.
Since you have meantioned voting power, how about trying to get a jumper
to flash the drive firmware place in the next latest/greatest ATA/ATAPI
spec. 
Let's all let the issue drop this issue for a day or two. I personally
hope you keep up the good work you've done with IDE/ATA support under
linux. Try to remember where all wrong occasionally, some of us more than
others. In the meantime please unpull the patch so those of us who wish to
test it can, and the others can sit by and see what happens.
