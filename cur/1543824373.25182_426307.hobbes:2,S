I really don't like the idea of having this variable called "new_"
something.  That implies that this is what the new end_pfn is going to
be.  The *new* one.  In reality, it is what it _might_ have been.  How
about "tmp_zone_end_pfn"?
This practice of dealing with spanned_pages is a real pain. 
I generally try to avoid max/min in code, but this struck me as possibly
being useful.  Do you find this easier to read, or your patch?
