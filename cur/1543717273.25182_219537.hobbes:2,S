Actually, real_lookup is done with parent's i_sem (avoiding rename is the
same directory) and it also uses rename_lock (seqence lock) which provides
protection against d_move. (real_lookup() --> d_lookup() --> __d_lookup()). 
So as real_lookup() does repeat the cached lookup, I don't see any chance
of missing a hashed dentry and allocating one more dentry with the same name.
