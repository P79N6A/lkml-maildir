yup: find mail1 mail2 -type f -print0 >/tmp/filelist
ext3.
thanks for the description of the block groups... that all makes more

what if you have a disk array with lots of spindles?  it seems at some
point that you need to give the array or some lower level driver a lot of
i/os to choose from so that it can get better parallelism out of the
hardware.
i see similar slowdowns on a 4-IDE-disk softRAID5+LVM+ext3 setup (SMP
2.4.19-pre7-ac4).  not nearly as bad as on the single disk.
