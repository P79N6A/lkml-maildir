You could use alt-sysrq to kill some tasks from the console, if you have
one. :-)

It gets killed because the sysadmin didn't put enough memory in the
machine. Which has nothing to do with overcommit...

You're confusing OOM situations with overcommit. OOM can happen without
overcommit.

Predicting what will fail has nothing to do with overcommit. It depends on
the kernels OOM behavior.

Which is Rik van Riel's patch, or something very much like it.
