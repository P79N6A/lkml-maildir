The length is too optimistic and insufficient to import the current BK
stuff.  I'd vote for 64 or at least 48 for each, although 48 is going to
be a tight fit.  It costs a bit but considering the expected payload
size it's irrelevant.
Committer (double t) email is up to 36 characters at the moment and the
name up to 43 characters when analyzing the shortlog script with this
little Perl snippet:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
while (($k, $v) = each %addresses) {
    $lk = length $k;
    $lv = length $v;
    if ($lk > $mk) { $mk = $lk; }
    if ($lv > $mv) { $mv = $lv; }
}
print "max key len $mk, max val len $mv\n";
------------------------------------------------------------------------
which prints: (key is the email, val the name)
max key len 43, max val len 36
