I'm glad to get confirmation on this. This leaves only one place, vide:
do_request, where we can queue up new commands. Much easier to trace and
makes queue_commands never run from IRQ context, which is simplyfiying
things too.

Right now the handlers are expected to clear IDE_BUSY and ->handler
themself. I have now an idea: Could you add a reporting about
the handler function there:
  	if (test_bit(IDE_DMA, ch->active)) {
			printk(KERN_ERR "%s: error: DMA in progress... %p\n", drive->name, ch->handler);
			break;
		}
And please take a short look at System.map.
This will show which IRQ handler is the culprit...
If it's indeed ide_dma_intr, let's have a look on it:
We see that it's calling udma_stop() immediately. This should
reset IDE_DMA unconditionally.. immediately on enty:
static inline int udma_stop(struct ata_device *drive)
{
	clear_bit(IDE_DMA, drive->channel->active);
	return drive->channel->udma_stop(drive);
}
Argh... There is a race in the above it should be:
static inline int udma_stop(struct ata_device *drive)
{
	int ret = drive->channel->udma_stop(drive);
         clear_bit(IDE_DMA, drive->channel->active);
         return ret;
}
Or we should move the clar_bit down do ide_dma_intr and
silbings behind __ata_end_request().
And finally we don't clear the IDE_BUSY on this code path.
