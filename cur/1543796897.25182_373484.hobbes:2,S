Agreed, linear reads are obviously an enormous improvement over seeking
all over the disk.  (Especially given my 15 ms seek latency.)  It would
suck to have to do all those seeks synchronously (before allowing the
swsusp resume to complete).  But see below for my suggested alternative.

I'm suggesting that rather than writing the clean pages out to the
image, simply make their metadata available to a post-resume userland
helper.  Something like
% head -2 /dev/swsusp-helper
/bin/sh 105-115 192 199-259
/lib/libc-2.3.2.so 1-250
where the userland program is expected to use the list of page numbers
(and getpagesize(2)) to asynchronously page in the working set in an
ionice'd manner.
This doesn't get rid of the seeks, of course, but doing them post-resume
will improve interactive performance while avoiding the cost of gigantic
swsusp images.

This is obviously the right thing for my situation, and it's on my list.
