The trouble with the WARN_ON is that it triggers even for code that is 
okay like noted by Jeremy. My initial intend with NULL was to allow the 
allocation of a zero sized pointer without extra checks. It should only
trigger a failure if something bad was done.
NULL had the problem of confusion with no memory available. I think BADPTR 
is good. If the coding warts are causing trouble then BADPTR will result 
in a failure. Otherwise if the code is doing a kmalloc(0) and not 
dereferencing the pointer (like Paul's fixed code) then we should be fine 
and not issue a warning.
The false positives may be upsetting some people.
