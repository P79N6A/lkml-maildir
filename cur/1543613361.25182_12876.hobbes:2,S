Release 1.9.9: Thu Dec 13 18:36:26 EST 2001
	* Minor cleanups by Richard Todd.
	* Passed Keith Owens's regression tests against CML1 make oldconfig.
Bug queue is empty.  The code has passed scrutiny and hands-on use by the rest
of the kbuild team.  There's a known rulebase glitch near extra-device handling
of SCSI disks which is not critical and should be a one-line fix by somebody
who knows what is actually going on there.
Things have come together nicely: (a) the code is ready and tested, (b) the rulebase 
needs only trivial cleanups, and (c) the Configure.help file is down to only 14 missing
entries, with 6 of the remaining promised any time now.  It looks like we'll actually
be ready to do a major-number release after 1.9.9.
