Known bug. Apply IDE113 (Aug 06, 11:02 CEST, from Martin), or just open 
drivers/ide/pcidma.c in your favorite text editor, look for (first) 
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_TRM290, and replace whole ifdef block with 
'*--table |= cpu_to_le32(0x80000000);'
Test in the ifdef is exactly opposite, and #ifdef is also wrong.
