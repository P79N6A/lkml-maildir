No, there are better ways.  Try
	% info libc crypt
	% info --index .PRECIOUS "GNU make"
incidentally, if you prefer seeing the output in your $PAGER,
you might prefer to use a hack such as
    #!/bin/sh
    chap=$1
    page=$2
    emacs --batch --eval "(progn
    	(require 'info)
    	(condition-case ()
    	  (Info-goto-node \"($chap)$page\")
    	  (error
    	    (Info-goto-node \"($chap)\")
    	    (Info-index \"$page\")))
    	(princ (buffer-string))
    	)" | $PAGER
where (assuming you call it infoman and make it executable and have Emacs
setup properly) you can do
	% infoman libc crypt
	% infoman make .PRECIOUS
It's still not as good as it should be, tho.
