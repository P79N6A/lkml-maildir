Well, I've played with it some, but it doesn't seem to see the MCE 
events that are in fact in /var/log/messages.
[root@coyote root]# parsemce -i </var/log/messages
This file contains no MCE dump
[root@coyote root]# parsemce -f /var/log/messages
This file contains no MCE dump
If I feed it the lines with the numbers it reports something about an 
invalid IP on restart.
[root@coyote root]# parsemce -e Bank 2: d40040000000017a -b Bank 2: -s 
d40040000000017a
Status: (ba) Error IP valid
Restart IP invalid.
The exact same output is obtained from the Bank 1 message & numbers 
too.
So I think I do not know how to use it.  Or the severeity of the 
report isn't high enough.  The logfile is currently about 1.27 megs 
but that doesn't seem to be a problem.  I haven't seen any more of 
them since I turned off the nonfatal exceptions in .config.  The 
logfile has several hundred K of samba errors from the plain 2.6.10 
kernel.
