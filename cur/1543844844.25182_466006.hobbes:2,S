Hi!
I made some quick experiments, and usb still eats 4W of battery
power. (With whole machine eating 9W, that's kind of a big deal)...
This particular machine has usb bluetooth, but it can be disabled by
firmware, and appears unplugged. (I did that). It also has fingerprint
scanner, that can't be disabled, but that does not have driver (only
driven by useland, and was unused in this experiment).
Any ideas?
								Pavel
