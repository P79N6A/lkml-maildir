a few other things that could be per-function attributes:
 - Using function trace 'limits': trace a function 50 times and dont trace 
   it afterwards. Each invocation of that function decreases the
   remaining-count by one. For example:
     echo 'btrfs_join_transaction:#2' >> set_ftrace_filter
   Would specify that we generate two trace entries of
   btrfs_join_transaction(), then stop tracing this function.
 - Using function-triggered tracing: a function could be specified (via a 
   filter format extension) to act as a 'start tracing' trigger. Another 
   extension would be 'stop tracing' trigger.
   For example:
      echo 'btrfs_join_transaction:+' >> set_ftrace_filter
      echo 'btrfs_commit_transaction:-' >> set_ftrace_filter
   The '+' is a start-tracing trigger condition, the '-' is a stop-tracing 
   trigger condition. All function calls between btrfs_join_transaction() 
   and btrfs_commit_transaction() would be traced.
The two could be combined - to generate the trace of a single btrfs 
transaction, one could do:
      echo 0 > tracing_enabled
      echo 'btrfs_join_transaction:+#1' >> set_ftrace_filter
      echo 'btrfs_commit_transaction:-#1' >> set_ftrace_filter
      echo 1 > tracing_enabled
Other extensions are possible too:
 - Trace length triggers. For example one could do:
      echo 'btrfs_join_transaction:+*#10' >> set_ftrace_filter
   To trace 10 function calls [allowed by current filter settings] after
   the first btrfs_join_transaction() call - and stop tracing after those 
   10 trace entries.
This would allow the creation of "surgical" one-time traces - of events 
and functions one is specifically interested in.
