sizeof(mem_map) is a crippling issue for 32-bit machines. Something needs
to be done and fast, but it looks like most of the programmer resources
that would otherwise be there to attack the issue are tied up with even
more severe problems preventing even smaller machines from working well.
Hopefully those can be dealt with swiftly enough before Halloween.
