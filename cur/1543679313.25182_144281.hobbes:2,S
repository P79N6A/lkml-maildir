Always do ask   POSTMASTER@vger.kernel.org   about this kind
of things...    It is summer-time, and even your ever watchfull
postmasters are going off-net for extended periods of time..
Contacting the ROLE contact will reach multiple people, hopefully
at least one of us is at hand.

Do find out, and tell us.
I blocked messages coming from there couple hours ago.
You have seen nothing, though.   DaveM had a horror situation,
as one misconfigured Norwegian site keeps pushing error messages
to listowner some 15-30 times a minute.  That has been going on
for about 20 hours now:
