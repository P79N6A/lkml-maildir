yeah. The biggest item in -ck besides SD is swap-prefetch, but that 
shouldnt have an effect in this case. I _think_ that most of the 
measured difference is due to scheduler details though. Right now my 
estimation is that with the patch i sent to Rob, and with latest 
sched-devel.git, CFS should perform as good or better than SD, even in 
these micro-benchmarks. (but i cannot tell what will happen on Rob's 
machine - so i'm keeping an open mind towards any other fixables :-) I'm 
curious about the next round of numbers (if Rob has time to do them).
