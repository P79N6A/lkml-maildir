Please don't. The imq device is buggy, it crashes when used
for ingress and egress at the same time, additionally it's
unmaintained since one or two years. The lartc list is full
of bugreports. Some users that depend on the functionality
are working on a better implementation, I'd suggest to wait
until then.
Best regards,
Patrick
