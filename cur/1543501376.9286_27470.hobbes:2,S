Hi.
I did not have this problem before when i tried with ide system.
now i have a scsi drive and when i boot it gives me panic during mount root
with a message
request_module[block-major-8] cant load.. (or somethihg like that).
i know this is the scsi disk module, i have the right alias for the adapter
in /etc/modules.conf
alias scsi_hostadapter ncr53c8xx
so what option should i turn on in the kernel compilation? or what modules i
need in /lib/modules/... for this to work?
thanks a ton.
Cheers,
ashokr
