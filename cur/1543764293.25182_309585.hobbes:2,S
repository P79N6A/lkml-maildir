What a shame you didn't say atomic_dec_and_lock()...

Yes, but those places normally also use locking to prevent the obvious race.
Yes, atomic_dec_and_test() and barrier removal would be better.  Especially
if it's associated with code commentary which explains why the whole thing
isn't racy (ie: explains why no other CPU can look this object up).

I continue to not see any point in cbus.  It moves work from one place to
another while increasing the amount of code and quite probably increasing
the net amount of work too.
IOW it looks like a net loss which happens to provide gains in one rather
uninteresting microbenchmark.
I'll gleefully admit that I'm wrong, but I don't think that has been
demonstrated yet.
