Yes, it should be queued fo 2.6.24.x

Fix is important both for 32 and 64 bits kernels, SLAB or SLUB.
SLAB does have this problem, but less prevalent than SLUB, because these
allocators dont have the same minimal size allocation (32 vs 8)
So with SLUB, it is possible that 8 CPUS share the same 64 bytes
cacheline to store their percpu counters, while only 2 cpus can share
this same cache line with SLAB allocator.
