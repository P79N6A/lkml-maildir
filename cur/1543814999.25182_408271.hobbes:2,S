You can never assume any attribute of the network whatsoever.
Even if initially the outgoing device is IPoIB, something in
the middle, like a traffic classification or netfilter rule,
could rewrite the packet and make it go somewhere else.
This even applies to loopback packets, because packets can
get rewritten and redirected even once they are passed in
via netif_receive_skb().

See above, this is not feasible.
The path an SKB can take is opaque and unknown until the very last
moment it is actually given to the device transmit function.
People need to get the "special case this topology" ideas out of their
heads. :-)
