Hi,
I got this. Should glibc/linux have MAXSYMLINKS?

If you have not already done so, please add a definition for the constant
MAXSYMLINKS to the <sys/param.h> file, define it to some appropriate value
(FreeBSD uses 32), and then please try to get the kernel developers to use
it in all places where they are trying to decide when to stop chasing down
a chain of symlinks.
