To change the prefetch workaround from a critical requirement to an
optimisation knob.
X86_USE_3DNOW is very similar: if it's enabled, the kernel has some
extra code to make certain CPUs run faster, but they also run fine
without it.  X86_OOSTORE is another.
What I'd really like your opinion on is the appropriate userspace
behaviour.  If we don't care about fixing up userspace, then
__ex_table is a much tidier workaround for the prefetch bug.  If we do
care about fixing up userspace, then do we need a policy decision that
says it's not acceptable to run on AMD without userspace fixups from
2.6.0 onwards - it must fixup userspace or refuse to run?
