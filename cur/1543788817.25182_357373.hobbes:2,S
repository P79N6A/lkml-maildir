My impression is that most of crash dump developers would like
to converge kexec/kdump approach. However they are developing
dump tools.
The reasons are
1) They have to maintain the dump tools and support their users.
   Many users are still using 2.4 kernels so merging kdump into 2.6
   kernel does not help them.
2) Commercial Linux Distros (Red Hat/Suse/MIRACLE(Asianux)/Turbo etc) use
   LKCD/diskdump/netdump etc.
   Almost no users use a vanilla kernel so kdump does not have users yet.

I think the way to go is the kdump however it may take time.
