Are you sure that is correct?  "Servers" normally listen for incoming
connections from clients rather than establish them[1]. So, if the
server implements ECN then it will respond appropriately to incoming
SYN packets irrespective of whether the ECN bits are set. People, who
use ECN, who are behind a broken firewall will have problems
connecting irrespective of whether or not the server implements ECN.
[1] Passive FTP being an exception.
