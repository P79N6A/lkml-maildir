There doesn't seem to have been any reply to this point unfortunately,
and it is something I am also wondering about.
The sh perf counters were not designed with overflowing in mind, they are
split in to a pair of 48-bit or 64-bit counters that simply keep running.
Any write simply clears the value and the counter starts over. They are
simply counters only, and generate no events whatsoever.
Oprofile has been a pretty bad fit for them, and while I'm slightly more
optimistic about perfmon, I'm rather less enthusiastic about yet another
peformance counter implementation that I am unable to make any use of.
