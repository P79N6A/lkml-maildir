HACK to diagnose the problem I mentioned to you some time ago, and it fixed
my problem too ...
He explained that the calibrate_tsc() subtracted the two register values it
gets, and uses that number in the divide.
A pretty effective fix would be to amend the code to say
	IF   the two register readings are the same
	THEN clear the TSC flag
Will this just "cover up" the problem, or is it a "kosher" test ?
