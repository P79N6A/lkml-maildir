In the nightly ltp run against the bk 2.5 tree last night I saw this
show up in the logs.
It happened on the 2-way PIII-550, 2gb physical ram, but not on the
smaller UP box I test on.

The past few nights it's been failing from compile errors such as the
vmlinux.lds.S error and such so I'm not for certain that this was caused
by something that got introduced yesterday.  It should be from something
pretty recent though.
Thanks,
