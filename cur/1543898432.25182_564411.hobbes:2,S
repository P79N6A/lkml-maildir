You talked about this pool even before, but honestly I don't see how it 
can help.
Pools requires management (mainly flush under pressure), and it wouldn't 
really do any benefit. Don't we already have enough pools in the 
allocation path?
The pool has to be UID (or cookie/whatever) based [1], so on top of the 
pool lookup/management code, you'll have another lock to be taken (the 
pool one). So using the UID (cookie) is simpler, faster and requires no 
extra code.
A simple numeric cookie virtually creates "pools" w/out requiring extra 
code. Yes, having really separate pool helps the recycle efficency, but 
I'm not sure that's worth the extra code.
[1] An mm_struct based pool would be clearly useless
