Well, enabling HRT allowed it to boot, but there are several casualties.  
For some reason, "heyu turn a14 off" which works with non-rt kernels, seems 
to hang forever, or until its ctl-c'd.  And all my control scripts that 
use heyu fail.  I killed the background processes that my startup script 
starts, re-ran them by hand and now its working.  Shakes head in 
puzzlement...
Tvtime is still dead, sits in a blue screen & no sound.  I have a cx88 
tvaudio process running at -5 nice that I can't kill, if I do its back on 
the next htop refresh.
/usr/local/bin/upsd (the belkin supplied version) is using up to half the 
cpu.  The cpu of course is running 10F warmer.  And a SIGHUP from htop 
killed it.  And restarting it via an "sh ./S99bulldog" causes a repeat of 
its cpu hogging.
Audacity-1.2.4 takes 30 seconds to clear the busy icon when started with no 
arguments from the icon.  I don't recall observing that before, but its 
been a while since I ran it for any reason too, so my memory could be hazy 
on that.
Hot-babe, (a debian toy) when running, looks normal, but uses 20% of the 
cpu, which contributes to the strip job. :)
All in all, it could be worse.  Now I have to shut down and replace the 
ailing battery in my ups, it just walked in the door.  And that has 
nothing to do with this kernel 2.6.18-rt2.
