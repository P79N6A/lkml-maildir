Before I posted my original question I read Patrick's very helpful overview of 
the Driver Model (www.amc.com.au/lca/loopback/papers/ 
Patrick_Mochel/Patrick_Mochel.pdf). 
The reason I posed the question, as a newcomer to kernel development, moving 
from WIN32 DDK development (sorry!) to Linux is that I was very surprised by 
the module interface. 
Would a more rigid 'plugin' interface and the concequent move from mainly 
'source' modules to binary 'plugins' (still with source-code available for 
all to see) mean that (a) Kernel was smaller (2) Had to be 
released/recompiled less (4) Was EVEN more stable and (4) 'plugins' were more 
portable across releases and easier to install ?
I love Linux but this seems to be holding it back...
