I don't think it is needed. There is no problem (i am thinking on rootles
nodes and PXE and so on...) on building a simple initrd with /dev/console,
/dev/null and half a dozen standard devices if they are needed. Just
to get udev run and have your real devices mounted there and overwrite
them.
I just remember one other oddity. To clean up my system, I copied the
running /dev to /dev-new, moved /dev to /dev-old and /dev-new to /dev.
But on 'reboot', I got a complaint about /dev/initctl not opening.
This could happen also with init. It opens real /dev/initctl on boot,
mounts /dev and tries to use new /dev/inittclt on shutdown...
