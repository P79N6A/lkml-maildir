Some people claim that vendor-sec is not trustworthy anymore because
it leaks information, based on the recent forged e-matters advisory.
Personally, I think the intent of the forgers was to discredit
vendor-sec.  There's no hard no evidence that there is a systematic
leak (apart from the occasional blunders).
