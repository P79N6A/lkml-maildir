Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.17-pre4 pnpbios driver available for testing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The pnpbios driver which was being developed in the 2.4.x-acy kernel
series is now available as a patch against 2.4.17-pre4:
  
http://panopticon.csustan.edu/thood/patch-2.4.17-pre4-pnpbios_1
A link to the patch can be found at:

Interested parties: Please test and report back.
Because this is the first cut of the patch and because the
driver hasn't been tested in the non-ac kernel series before,
I recommend caution, especially to Sony Vaio and Dell laptop
users.
