It hasn't changed. Linux always scheduled tasks on available CPUs
(sans cache affinity heuristics).
IIRC, 1.3.38 was the first kernel with stable SMP support that I
played with, and it definately scheduled threads on separate CPUs
(otherwise my threaded compute applications wouldn't have sped up by a
factor of 2).
