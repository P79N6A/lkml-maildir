Well, I have been playing now with the sysdev class of
APIs for installing objects into /sys/devices/system.
Unforturnately, the capabilities of that do not
provide me with what I was wanting for EDAC.
What I was wanting was an extra directory called
'edac'. In that directory was to be various types of
edac devices (memory controller and PCI Parity to
start)
In the directory /sys/devices/system:
edac/mc/mc0/<attr and controls>
edac/mc/mc1/<attr and controls>
edac/mc/<attr and controls>
and
edac/pci/<attr and controls>
This would allow for future edac components.
What I found out was that /sys/devices/system doesn't
allow for nested subsystems. At least not from what I
have read.
With the current APIs I can have the following in
/sys/devices/system:
edac_mc/edac_mc0/<attr and controls>
edac_mc/edac_mc1/<attr and controls>
edac_mc/<attr and controls>
and
edac_pci/edac_pci0/<attr and controls>
One solution is to add to the sysdev.c API set, but I
just don't want to go there. 
So, it seems that what I can implement is the last set
of layout
above.
Thoughts?
Thanks
