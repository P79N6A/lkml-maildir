Greetings!
As my problem remains unresolved, I am reposting this
message seeking helps.
I am exeperiencing the similar problem in kernel
2.4.18, glibc 2.2.5, and patched gcc 2.95.3
(
http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/glib-linux-archive/0110/0
007.html). I mounted /dev/hda1 to /.
mke2fs /dev/hdc1
aborts with message:
File size limit exceeded
In exactly the same environment I also booted to
kernel 2.2.13 installed from Slackware and then
mke2fs /dev/hdc1 without problem.
The major changes I have made to linux 2.4.18 are:
(1) I patched linux-2.4.18 with win4lin's patch
files.
(2) I enabled software raid1 for linux 2.4.18 while
the 2.2.13 Slackware distribution enables software
raid0.
I can not mke2fs /dev/hdc1 as what I really want to
do is
mke2fs /dev/md0
which also failed in 2.4.18.
Please help and thank you in advance!
