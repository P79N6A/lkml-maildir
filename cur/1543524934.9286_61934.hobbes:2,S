960MiB with standard malloc. Then you bump in system libraries. You can allocate
more memory with mmap. Here was some talks about fixing it and make mmap and
brk regions shared so you can allocate up to 3GiB with rbk OR with mmap (and
not only with clever malloc doing combination of both) but AFAIK kernel gurus
was ignorant on subject :-/ To sad, really...

This is normal behaviour...
