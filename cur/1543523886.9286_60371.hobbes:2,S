Tried that a while ago.  It fails.  The bash case falls over pretty
quickly.  Using ash gets a little further, but not much.  Using sash
gets me to a command line prompt but actually doing anything with it
results in the child dying with sig-11.

Will do.  I've already traced the faulty kernel quite extensively, and
the fault address is just outside of the mapped area.  I'll do the same
with a working kernel.

The traces I obtained last time I attacked this were all completely
deterministic (except for occassional variations due to the pgd bug ---
I don't see that failure mode any more).  The kernel dies while still
paging in init, so we're not yet at the point where there is concurrent
IO going on when things fall apart.  I've already eliminated things like
IO readahead as possible culprits: setting the paging cluster size to 1
page doesn't change things.
