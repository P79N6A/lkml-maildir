Hi,
After a rather tiresome nightly sit through, we discovered that when
going from kernel 2.6.3 to kernel 2.6.7 the SATA disk device naming
on at least the AMD64 platform changes from : /dev/hde and up 
to /dev/sda and up. What a total disaster. 
Effectively this means that your installed AMD64 platform based
linux distro cannot mount its root filesystem anymore.
We installed mandrake 10.0 amd64 and had to go back todo a initial
install on a UDMA IDE disk on /dev/hda.
Is there in such cases a smart workaround available, maybe as an extra
GRUB/LILO boot option ? And why was the device naming changed in 
such a fatal way, effectively going from IDE to SCSI device names.
Googling for "kernel init no init found" results in :
Results 11 - 20 of about 323,000 for kernel init no init found. 
ouch :(
Regards,
Robert
