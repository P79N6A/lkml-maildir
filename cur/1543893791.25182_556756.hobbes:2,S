Unfortunately that isn't really an option, since on the embedded side  
we allow the device tree to be much simpler.  For example, we dont  
require the firmware to produce a full PCI device tree and populate  
the device tree with it.  A lot of embedded PPCs use linux as the pci  
bios.

Both of these platforms do it because their OF implementations are  
more complete than anything we'd see on the embedded side.
