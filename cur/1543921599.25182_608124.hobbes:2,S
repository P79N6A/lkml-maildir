Yeah, pity it did not fix it :( I will try to port Tejuns patch 
(
http://home-tj.org/wiki/index.php/Sil_m15w#Patches
) to 2.6.23 today or 
tomorrow. If you are testing anyway, could you then also try this?

Yes, all pci-slots are free and the systems to have between 4 and 16GB memory 
(ecc, monitored with edac). Well, those are cluster systems (actually tyan 
names those B2882).
Do you think the configuration is related? Here it also happens with odirect, 
we tested this to minimize memory effects.
Cheers,
