It will pause during initialization with older firmware and it tends to
spew a few messages because Promise interpretation of the I2O spec is
somewhat different to other devices, as well as including some clear
mistakes

The new firmware isn't I2O any more. I've not found any public docs on
the newer firmware interface and since it was way slower than the 3ware
