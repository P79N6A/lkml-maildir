OK, so a hypothetical GPL version 3 allows someone to copy a program and
distribute it as binary only, or otherwise allows the copier to make a
distribution that does not allow GPL version 2. This might allow a copier
to pull a copy of a GPL program into a proprietary environment, and do
proprietary derivative works.
So it is possible to dream up a GPL version 3 that slips a program into
non-freeness, I believe. However, that would only affect derivative works,
and only if those derivative works are done by someone who wants to do
non-free software.
