Well it *does* make development of SR-IOV drivers that much harder.  As you 
know, out of tree development is a pain.  OTOH if any changes end up being 
required, they can be done before the code is merged.
Anyway, hopefully we won't have to worry about it because some driver will 
come along soon that uses Yu's code. :)  If not, Yu might have to maintain a 
separate git tree or something until the drivers are ready to be merged.
