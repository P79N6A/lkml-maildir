The short answer is no but that we're collecting them. Right now, I can say
that if you take our whole stack into consideration OCFS2 for things like
kernel untars and builds (a common test over here), is typically almost as
fast as ext3 (single node obviously) even when we have a second or third
node mounted.
As far as specific DLM timings go, we're in the process of collecting them.
As you know, lately we have been deep in a process of stabilizing things :)
While we have collected timings independent of the FS in the past, we
haven't done that recently enough that I'd feel comfortable posting it.

Heh, sorry about that - I'll try to do better in the future :)
