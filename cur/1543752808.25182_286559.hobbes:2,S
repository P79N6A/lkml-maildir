Just FYI, SELinux does apply checking via the security hooks in mmap and
mprotect, and can be used to prevent a process from executing anything
it can write via policy.  
The TPE security module recently posted to lkml by Lorenzo also tries to
prevent untrusted users/groups from executing anything outside of
'trusted paths', likewise using the security hooks in mmap and mprotect.
