Current versions contain
  MODULE_LICENSE("GPL and additional rights");

But who's actually taking legal actions?
Perhaps pending legal changes that will turn copyright violations into 
crimes might help to take legal actions without the legal risks of
civil trials.
Otherwise, it seems to be highly unlikely that anyone will want to sue a 
company that is often located in a different country, and the only 
possible legal action will be cease and desist letters against people 
who are infriding the copyright by e.g. selling Linux distributions 
containing fglrx at Ebay or operating Debian ftp mirrors. That sounds 
highly unfair, but unfortunately it also seems to be the only effective 
way for someone without a big wallet to effectively act against such 
licence violations...
