Subject: [RFC] SLAB : NUMA cache_free_alien() very expensive because of virt_to_slab(objp); nodeid = slabp->nodeid;

Hi
I noticed on a small x86_64 NUMA setup (2 nodes) that cache_free_alien() is very expensive.
This is because of a cache miss on struct slab.
At the time an object is freed (call to kmem_cache_free() for example), the underlying 'struct slab' is not anymore cache-hot.
struct slab *slabp = virt_to_slab(objp);
nodeid = slabp->nodeid; // cache miss
So we currently need slab only to lookup nodeid, to be able to use the cachep cpu cache, or not.
Couldn't we use something less expensive, like pfn_to_nid() ?
On x86_64 pfn_to_nid usually shares one cache line for all objects (struct memnode)
Is it possible virt_to_slab(objp)->nodeid being different from pfn_to_nid(objp) ?
