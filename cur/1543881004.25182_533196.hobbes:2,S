another thing i just noticed: when starting up lots of ocbench tasks 
(say -x 6 -y 6) then they (naturally) get started up with an already 
visible offset. It's nice to observe the startup behavior, but after 
that it would be useful if it were possible to 'resync' all those 
ocbench tasks so that they start at the same offset. [ Maybe a "killall 
-SIGUSR1 ocbench" could serve this purpose, without having to 
synchronize the tasks explicitly? ]
