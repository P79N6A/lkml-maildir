Umm. This is why we write things like
	static void double_lock_balance(struct rq *this_rq, struct rq *busiest)
		__releases(this_rq->lock)
		__acquires(busiest->lock)
		__acquires(this_rq->lock)
	{
		...
ie your "__holds()" is nothing new, and should be written as 
a pair of __releases(x) and __acquires(x), which is more readable anyway 
(since it actually says what the function does!)
