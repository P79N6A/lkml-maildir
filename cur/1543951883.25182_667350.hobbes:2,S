The traditional and proven method to constructing a reliable system is
to assume that no component can be fully trusted.  This is especially
true for new code.
By being paranoid about everything, failures in one component are
usually contained well enough that one failure is not catastrophic.
In order for ramback to get appeal with the people who are paranoid
about data integrity (probably a vast majority of users), you will
need some guarantees about flush order, etc...
