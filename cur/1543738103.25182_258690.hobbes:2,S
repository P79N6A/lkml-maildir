libata exists as it does simply due to how it evolved.
Please just submit patches containing the changes you want, I'm very 
receptive to improvements that increase the breadth of libata's coverage.
As the name implies, libata is just a library of code and nothing more. 
  A driver could choose to use the to/from FIS functions and none of the 
driver architecture, for example.  libata exists solely to concentrate 
ATA code into a single location.
(similarly, include/linux/ata.h exists to concentrate all ATA-related 
defines in one location)
