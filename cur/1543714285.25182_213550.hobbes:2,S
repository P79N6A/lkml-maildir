Yes, on the filesystems level.  Jffs2 is usable, although not
well-suited for disks and similar, ext2compr appears to be unusable.
On the device level, I haven't heard of anything yet.

I'd go for a dm implementation.

If you really want to deal with this, you end up with a device that
can grow and shrink depending on the data.  Unless you have a strange
fetish for pain, you shouldn't even think about it.

Makes sense.  One of the zlib developers actually calculated the
maximum expansion when zlib-compressing data, so you could even get
away with more than 50% net size, but that makes the code more
complicated.  Your call.
Performance should not be a big issue, as encryption is a performance
killer anyway.
Whether it is acceptable depends on the user.  Make it optional and
let the user decide.

Again, depends on the user.  But from experience, there are plenty of
users who want something like this.
