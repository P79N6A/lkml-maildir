Like other people said, scripts rely on it. Not just kernel-build
scripts or thelike. Note that this local build ID is _also_ in
/proc/version, meaning that every possible script out there has
code/regex to skip or read that one field.
E.g.
($ver, $builder, $gcc, $id, $flags, $date) =
  ($_ =~ /^Linux version (\S+) \((\S+)\) \((.*)\) (#\d+) (.*) ((?:Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun).*)/);
Oh well we could also put a static "#0" in there, but it also has
its uses (see replies from other people).
