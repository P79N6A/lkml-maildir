Yep, try_module_get solves the general synchronization problem for
the special but interesting case of modules, but not for the general
case.

Yes, I think just sleeping isn't so bad at all. First of all,
we already have the module use count as a kind of "don't unload
now" advice (not sure if you plan to phase out MOD_INC_USE_COUNT ?),
and second, it's not exactly without precedent anyway. E.g. umount
will have little qualms of letting you sleep "forever". (And,
naturally, every once in a while, people hate it for this :-)
Anyway, I'll write more about this tomorrow. For tonight, I
have my advanced insanity 101 to finish, topic "ptracing
more than one UML/TT at the same time".
