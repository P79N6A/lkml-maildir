Hi all
I have noticed that when doing
  cat /dev/cdrom > /dev/null
on a Linux 2.2.x kernel (x=1,6), the following messages appear on the
console right at the end of the CD:
     ATAPI device hdc:
       Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
       Logical block address out of range -- (asc=0x21, ascq=0x00)
     hdc: command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
     hdc: command error: error=0x50
     end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 300708
     ATAPI device hdc:
       Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
       Illegal mode for this track or incompatible medium -- (asc=0x64,ascq=0x00
     cat: /dev/cdrom: I/O error
Similar messages occur when using a SCSI CDROM and don't seem to be
dependant on whether it is a CDR or a pressed CD being read.
This didn't seem to occur with 2.0.36 (or 2.0.30 for that matter).  Is this
a bug or is it just a deliberate design decision (if so, why was it done)?
How can one cleanly read a CDROM image under 2.2.x (or can/should the above
errors just be ignored)?
Regards

PS: please CC any replies to me as the kernel list archive i'm currently
    accessing may be missing some articles for some reason.  Thanks.
