Hello,
After trying 2.6.22-rc2, I noticed the warning message from libata about
upgrading shutdown(8). First, I have two SATA disks, and get the warning for
only one of them. Second, I double-checked the source of shutdown for my
distro (Debian unstable), and do not see anything related to issueing
STANDBYNOW.
So, is the warning bogus, or could something else trigger the problem on
one disk only (if getting only one message means that the problem is
only detected on one disk).
As these messages come very late in the shutdown process, I do not have
an easy way to reproduce them.
Thanks in advance,
