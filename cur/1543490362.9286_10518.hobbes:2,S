Carefull built does not neccesarlly mean it's produced good code, I've had
2.8.1 bail with an internal compile error or produce bad code in too many
cases. -02 is completely unuesable on any of my systems.
I've not been happy with gcc I'm about to move all my systems to egcs and
hope for better results.
