Yes, but noone gave STRONG reason to keep it up :-)

No. It's not MS-Windows way. It's Linux way. In MS-Windows word you can not
afford such luxurity since usually you do not have sources and so can not fix
them.

May be but if this will need to keep up all ugly hacks and broken API for ages
then better "well, it's Unix, I guess" :-))

Thanx god, not forever. It's not MS-Windows (where you STILL have support for
ugly obsoleted-more-then-10-years-ago FCB-based API !). It's Linux. It will be
marked as obsolete and then it will be deleted altogether. In our case it must
be marked as obsolete in 2.2.11 and removed in 2.4 ...
It's beauty of Linux to me: it's system where develepers are not afraid to
remove obsoleted or ugly API ... With discussion and proposed replacements,
of course :-)
