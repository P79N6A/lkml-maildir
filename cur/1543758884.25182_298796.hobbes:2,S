All of these arguments are circular.  If people think that even/odd
will devalue odd releases, guess what 2.6.x.y will do?  By that line
of reasoning nobody will test 2.6.x just the same as they aren't
testing 2.6.x-rc* right now.
I think they will test the odd releases, because as a real release
they will get slashdot/lwn.net/etc. announcements.
That's one of the major things the -rc's don't get.  Maybe it gets
a reference in lwn.net's weekly kernel article, but mostly kernel
geeks read those and that's not who we want testing -rc's (such
geeks already are doing so).
It has to be a "real" release.  That does have an impact.  However,
I am ambivalent about how to make them real.  Even/odd, 2.6.x.y,
either is fine with me.
