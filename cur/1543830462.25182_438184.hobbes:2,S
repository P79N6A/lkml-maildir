Maybe not machines, but definitely usage scenarios. I've tried both 
implementations lately, and swsusp would often -- especially under high 
memory load -- just return from trying, while suspend2 succeeds in freeing 
enough memory to be able to suspend _every_ time. 
Returning with "sorry, not enough free mem" is definitely nothing you'd want 
when you stuff your notebook into the bag because you have to change trains, 
for example.
Is that something uswsusp is likely to change anytime soon?
