Well, due to [insert long explanation] the -test8 kernel wasn't available. 
The "good" machine built a -test9, which crashed as well. *sigh* Mind you, 
there are differences between the kernel _it_ builds and the one built by 
the "bad" machine. I've uploaded a alien -t'd debian kernel packages to the 
fastest web space I have for you to have a peek, if you have some time. 
(what with lawsuits and whatnot ;-)
2.6.0-test9 built on the "good" box:

2.6.0-test9 built on the "bad" box:

More importantly though, the post from Jindrich:

When I compiled on the "bad" machine with disabled HIGHMEM, the resultant 
kernel has NO problems with cryptoloop. I can make a cryptoloop fs, mount, 
copy, unmount, remount etc. That kernel is at:
http://monolith.dnsalias.org/~cafuego/kernel-image-2.6.0-test9-kahlua.3.tgz
So I guess HIGHMEM breaks cryptoloop somehow.
