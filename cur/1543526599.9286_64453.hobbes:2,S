This might be slightly ot, but according to kerneli.org, this list is the
closest there is to a list for it.
I've been using an encrypted /home for the past week or so now, and
generally speaking it works perfect. However, when doing disk intensive
things that can't be cached (like a make on a large source tree), programs
that constantly need a bit of cpu time (like xmms) occassionaly don't get
their timeslice in time, (and thus, the mp3's skip). Is this because
the filesystem routines are meant for an unencrypted(=fast) filesystem,
and thus too large chunks of work are being done at a time, and is there
a way to fix this?
