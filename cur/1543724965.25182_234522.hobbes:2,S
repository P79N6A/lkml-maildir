Subject: A trivial patch for removing unnecessary comment in mm/filemap.c

Hi,
This patch removes some unnecessary comments in mm/filemap.c in function find_get_page. First, there is no 
longer a hash list being used, second the lock being used is the same for search as well as addition/removal.
Thanks,
Himanshu
