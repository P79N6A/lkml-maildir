"make -j" is a lot of fun on a dual athlon w/ 512mb :)

Sigh.  since I am a VM ignoramus I doubt my opinion matters much at all
here... but it would be nice if oddball configurations like 384MB with
50MB swap could be supported.  I don't ask that it perform optimally at
all, but at least the machine should behave predictably...
This type of swap configuration makes sense for, "my working set is
pretty much always in RAM, including i/dcache, but let's have some swap
just-in-case"

I'm pretty sure swap was 100% full.  I should have sysrq'd and checked
but I forgot.

cnt % 5000 may have been a bit extreme but it was fun to see it thrash. 
sysrq was pretty much the only talking point into the system.
