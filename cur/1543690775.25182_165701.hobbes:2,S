I don't know who but i can say that Linus or anyone he
assigns can do so based not on GPL but on trademark.  That is
to say that while it wouldn't be a violation of the
copyright license to distribute such modified code but it
would be within the rights of the trademark holder (Linus)
to refuse them the _privilege_ of calling the modified code
Linux.  Not only would it be within his rights but it is
necessary for him to define and enforce restrictions on what
may be called Linux or he would lose that authority.
Just like you can make a copy of Red Hat's distribution but
without Red Hat Inc's explicit permission you cannot call it Red
Hat or Maroon Chapeau, etc.  For that matter the Open group
could, in theory, deny SCO the privilege of of calling their
own products UNIX.
