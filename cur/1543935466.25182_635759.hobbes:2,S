As well you should. I am honestly curious (for my own satisfaction) as 
to what the natsemi docs say the delay code should do  (can't imagine 
they say "use io port 80 because it is unused").  I don't have any 
copies anymore. But mere curiosity on my part is not worth spending a 
lot of time on - I know you are super busy.   If there's a copy online 
at a URL ...

I agree that the problems of chip logic and ISA delay are all tangled 
up, probably more than need be.  I hope that the solution turns out to 
simplify matters, and hopefully to document the intention of the 
resulting code sections a bit more clearly for the future.
