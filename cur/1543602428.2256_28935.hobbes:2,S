I am looking at adding a hook to the kernel to allow
core dumps to go somewhere other than ./core.  
Initially, I'm looking into allowing core to be a fifo (yeah, it's a
hack, but supposedly it worked on solaris in 1998), but later I'll
want to be able to set a default coredump handler for all processes.
Looking at previous discussion on the topic, e.g. 
Kenneth Albanowski (kjahds@kjahds.com)'s post "Re: core files" on 1999/01/01
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&selm=fa.m8ig46v.1b2q89r
%40ifi.uio.no ,
the scheme that comes to mind is:
When the kernel wants to dump core on a process, it opens the fifo
/dev/coredumper and writes the pid of the process to the fifo, then
puts the process to sleep.  On error, no fifo, or fifo still full after 
a couple minutes, it dumps core as before.
The process listening to /dev/coredumper reads the pid, then opens a fd
to where it wants the core to be dumped to, then uses ptrace
to request a core dump of the given pid to the given fd.
The fd may be a normal file, or a socket or fifo (in which case the
kernel uses padding rather than seeking to page boundaries).
Security is maintained because /dev/coredumper can be owned by root and chmod 600,
and because the daemon reading from it must have privs to use ptrace on
the given process.
This would allow just-in-time debugging as well as remote core dumping.
