The conversation here has pretty much died down, and it probably doesn't belong
on the linux-kernel list long term in any case.
If you are interested in EROS, or in other capability systems, I invite you to
join the appropriate mailing lists at www.eros-os.org.  A list of the available
mailing lists can be found at 
http://www.eros-os.org/project/mailing-lists.html.
Instructions for how to subscribe can also be found there.
eros-os.org is also the home of the e-lang mailing list.  E is a
capability-based scripting language.
Mail to these lists, in case you missed some or all of the discussion, can be
browsed from

Thanks for the good questions!
