This is probably because your drives only read ahead 64k at a
time (maybe even less). When you get data 4k at a time both
drives can continue to fill their cache at the same time.
When using large stripes you are switching drives and not
properly streaming each drive, this causes the performance
loss you've been seeing.
It is entirely possible that the optimal is at 8, 16 or
even 32 kB -- it varies according to drive type, firmware
version and other 'fun' environmental variables...
