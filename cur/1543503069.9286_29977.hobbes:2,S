I thought of that.  It would definitely simplify the guts, but I have this
nasty suspicion it would break too many things.  For example, imagine that
your program is a daemon which has recorded its pid somewhere so it can be
sent SIGHUP when it needs to reread its config files.  It did that before
calling pthread_create.  The signal will get sent to the manager, not the
thread that's actually listening.
(Of course, the manager could reflect the signal to a "real" thread.  That
_could_ get you closer to POSIX thread semantics.  It'd double signal
latency and serialize, but correctness is more important than speed...)

I like it.

Would work for initially detached threads (with more overhead), but you can
detach a thread at any point after its creation.
It occurs to me that the library has to do cleanup when a thread exits.  It
could be done by the exiting thread _if_ we are prepared to live with the
cleanup not happening when a thread gets kill -9.

p.s. Someone is theoretically rewriting libpthread.  It doesn't look likely
to get done anytime soon though.
