I can't apply this while I think it looks horribly broken.
Your patch makes scsi_lib call blk_queue_end_tag() without holding the
queue spinlock.
Which looks horribly broken, since it _will_ corrupt the queues.
In fact, it looks about a million times more broken than the code that
Martin submitted.
Please explain to me why I am wrong.

PS. I actually do tend to look as the patches I apply. Right now it looks
like you're wrong, and Martin is right.
