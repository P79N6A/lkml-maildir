Reprogramming takes 3-4 times as long.  However, I still agree
it's a good idea.
RTAI will run the 8254 timer in one-shot mode if you ask it to.
However, on machines without a monotonically increasing counter,
i.e., the TSC, you have to use 8254 timer 0 as both the timebase
and the interval counter -- you end up slowly losing time because
of the race condition between reading the timer and writing a
new interval.  RTAI's solution is to disable kd_mksound and
use timer 2 as a poor man's TSC.  If either of those is too big
of a price, it may suffice to report that the timer granularity
on 486's is 10 ms.
It would be nice to see any redesign in this area make it more
modular.  I have hardware that would make it possible to slave
the Linux system clock directly off a high-accuracy timebase,
which would be super-useful for some applications.  I've been
doing some of this already, both as a kernel patch and as part
of RTAI; search for 'timekeeper' in the LKML archives if interested.
