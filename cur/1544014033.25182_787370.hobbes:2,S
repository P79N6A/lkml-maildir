Well, you're answering a different statment than what
I was talking about -- I wanted to make sure that TAI
information was available via NTP -- this has nothing
to do with the kernel, and would be something available
to all operating systems.
Anyway -- I'm looking at the patch you reference, and
maybe I'm being dumb -- but -- I think I see a bug.
case TIME_DEL decrements TAI, but TIME_INS does
not increment it. Instead, there's a lonely increment in
TIME_OOP which seems wrong.  ??
