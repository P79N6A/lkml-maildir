For now, yes, it is.  
One reason is that my script to find errors doesn't trigger for that.
Another is that this is not that critical.  If the probe function is in
.init.text you can get an oops.  If remove is in .text it just occupies
RAM without being used (if HOTPLUG=n).  And if remove is in .exit.text
and is properly wrapped in __exit_p when assigning .remove everything is
fine, too, you just cannot remove a device.
Maybe I will address this in later series.
Best regards
Uwe
