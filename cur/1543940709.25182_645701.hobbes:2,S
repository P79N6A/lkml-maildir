 It seems we needn't this solution. There is loop auto-destruction
 patch in -mm.
 Kernel part:
    
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119361296818388&w=2
 mount(8) part:
    
http://marc.info/?l=util-linux-ng&m=119362955431694&w=2
 So, with this patch mount(8) needn't to maintain info about loops and
 umount(8) doesn't need to call LOOP_CLR_FD ioctl, because umount(2)
 is enough.
