oh hey, we've got an estimated 1.7 billion inodes in production right now.
of course, they're not *all* active, nor are they all on the same
server...  :)
it is scary though.  filesystems and tools don't really scale well to this
size at the moment.  you certainly don't want to do more than several
million inodes on one fs -- otherwise you start running into insane backup
difficulties plus unacceptably long fsck times.  (of course we use a
logging fs -- but at scale, you produce filesystem corruption on a regular
basis regardless what the filesystem/os/hardware is, and fsck time
determines downtime some users might experience.)
mmm.  scaling.  it's such a wonderful problem space.
