Correct. You need to have /dev/mouse point to /dev/input/mice. This will
fix the gpm problem. Same with the X server. Note the irq1 stuff is
because pc_keyb.c is always compiled in. Its the same reason why people
with just USB keyboards get the AT keybaord not present error? GIve us
some time as the console system will migrate over to the input api.
