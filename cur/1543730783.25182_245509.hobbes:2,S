You compile crap into the kernel, you are screwed.  We have not and will 
not change that.
Reiser4 plugins are not for end users to download from amazon.com, they 
are for weekend hackers to send me a cool plugin for me to review, 
assign a plugin id to, and send to Linus in the next release.  Sometimes 
being less ambitious works better, and dynamically loaded plugins would 
have made the infrastructure too bulky to be fun and fast.
