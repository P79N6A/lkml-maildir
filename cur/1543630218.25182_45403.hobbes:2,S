Dave & Martin,
I noticed you guys included Kasper Dupont's patch in your
2.5.15 patch kits:
>With 3c509 compiled in kernel calling ifup after lots of
>diskaccess causes an Oops.
>
>read_eeprom was incorrectly marked as __init. This patch
>applies against 2.4.19-pre8-ac1 and maybee also 2.4.19-pre8:
Note that 2.4.19-pre8-ac1 has a newer version of 3c509.c than
either 2.4.19-pre8 vanilla or 2.5.15, and it's only the newer
version that calls read_eeprom() from non-__init code.
This patch is not needed for 2.5.15.
(The only calls to read_eeprom() in 2.5.15 are from el3_probe(),
which is __init.)
