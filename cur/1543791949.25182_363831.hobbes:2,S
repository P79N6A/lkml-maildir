Could we *please* get rid of this ridiculous return type of compat_ioctl?
->ioctl() returns 32bit value.  Everywhere.  On 32 and 64 bit platforms.
Having ->compat_ioctl() return value twice wider than not just emulated
->ioctl(), but native one as well...
Let's kill that stupidity before adding fsckloads of new instances.
