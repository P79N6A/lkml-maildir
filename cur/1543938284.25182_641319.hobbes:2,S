For now it is a bug to select a symbol with dependencies...
If we could say that we always have HOTPLUG when we have HOTPLUG_CPU
that would kill a lot of a lot of Section Mismatch warnings.
But as things stands out we can build a kernel with HOTPLUG_CPU
but without HOTPLUG.
#if defined(CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU && !defined(CONFIG_HOTPLUG)
# error illegal configuration - talk to the PM guys
#endif
could do it?

Or maybe a higer level solution.
select is used for three pruposes:
- to include specific minimalitic functionality as for example done on
  the ARM Kconfig file with success
- to enable general functionality (the HAVE_* way to do it)
- to enable subsystems of different sizes
And it is only when people try to do the latter it blows up.
And they do so to make it easier for people to configure the kernel
but the end result is the opposite.
