you should use gameport_register_port() only to hardware game ports (e.g.
those found on soundcards).
USB joysticks don't need a gameport, so USB joystick drivers should call
directly input_register_device().

'node' is a kernel style linked list (struct list_head). I don't know
any URL which explains how it works but you may find it in Robert Love's
Linux Kernel Development book.
