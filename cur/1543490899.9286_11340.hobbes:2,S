Dave,
What are specific complaints against the "VIA Chipset" are you refering 
to and a list of effected mainboard venders would be useful.  Since I will
be getting few flavors on loan to resolve IDE-DMA issues that some folks
have, I would be able to poke into some of the issues you have.  Also I
have many of these "FA310TX" cards that have been nothing less than rock
solid with the "tulip.c" code.
