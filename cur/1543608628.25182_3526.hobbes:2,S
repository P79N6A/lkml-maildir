You are right on the money. 4608 every read call.....
Now we ran also our patch terms out we also don't return right 
on 32KB, but dependent on the pipe-size return more than 4608.
Even on vanilla, it seems the blocking read semantics are 
wait for at least 1 byte and then return as much as you can.
We are running somemore experiments now to see what exactly is going on.

Let's first agree exactly on the read semantics that we want to see ?
Than let's keep comparing where things are heading to see what 
makes the most sense.
