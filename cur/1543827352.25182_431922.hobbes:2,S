Something has corrupted memory.  thread_info->task points to a task_struct
at ed103560, but that task_struct->thread_info contains 00000000, its
command-line field (comm) contains junk and its pid is -1.  This is
very hard to diagnose.  Are you using 8K stacks?  Stack overflow is one
possible cause, the other likely one is random memory scribbles.
I've been playing with this patch but it's only boot tested on one config.
It should catch this kind of corruption earlier but I can't easily test
that.
Whether IO-APIC caused this bug or not, it's hard to say...
