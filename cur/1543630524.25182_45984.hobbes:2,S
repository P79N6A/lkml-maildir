When  try to run lilo with a kernel after 2.5.12 to a floppy i get:
Fatal: open /dev/fd0: Read-only file system
Im runnig on a x86 platform with with a AMD K6 
to me it seems at an enduser error because knowbody has this problem reported
this or is it realy a bug.
The floppy drive is detected :
May 14 07:09:07 orac kernel: Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
May 14 07:09:07 orac kernel: FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
