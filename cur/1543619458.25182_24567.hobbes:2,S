Thanks for your reaction Stephan, but I seriously doubt the change below
would fix the problem... Also, as the problem appears randomly, and
usually after some uptime, I obviously can not know about it being fixed
if I constantly upgrade the kernel. I'd rather wait and see if it
appears again in time after I did a kernel upgrade, and not trying every
-pre while there's no mention on the mailing list of such bug being
fixed.
Anyway, I just rebooted with 2.4.18-pre7-ac1, we'll see if it helps.
Regards,
