In the ext2 compression code, they compress maybe 8 source blocks into
(hopefully) some smaller number of compressed blocks.  Yes, there is still
a minimum block size, but you can save some reasonable fraction of the
total space (e.g. 8 blocks down to 4.5 blocks still gives you 5/8 = 37%
compression, although not 50%).  You get more efficient compression the
more source blocks you use, although your "damage area" grows in case of
error.
Cheers, Andreas
