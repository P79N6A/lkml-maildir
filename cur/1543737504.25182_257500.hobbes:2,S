The patch provides complete backwards compatibility if _ASSUME_POSIX_TIMERS is not set.
If _ASSUME_POSIX_TIMERS is set then the patch assumes that this also
indicates that the cpu timers are available. Which would break binary
compatibility. Is that what you are referring to?
Also it seems the patch does not address clock_getcpuclockid() etc. I can
add that.
I had to take the material from sysdeps/unix/clock_* and put it into
sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/clock_* because otherwise I would have broken all
the other users of sysdeps/unix/clock_*. I need the fallback to the
timer syscalls for clockids unknown to glibc that would have meant a
significant change to the code in sysdeps/unix/clock_*
I would be very grateful if you could indicate to me what fixes are
necessary to make the patch acceptable.
