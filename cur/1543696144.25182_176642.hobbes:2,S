Hi,
I'm looking for a method to map user ids on the nfs server. I need to setup 
nfsd to work in a mixed environment Linux server + Linux and Mac OS X 
clients. NFSv3 will be used.
Does the kernel nfsd support user id mapping? If yes, what do I need to get it 
to work? The only way to map user ids I found is to use the user space nfsd, 
but it hasn't been updates in ages and doesn't support v3 afaik.
Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.
Bye,
Oliver
