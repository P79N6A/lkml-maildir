I get burned on this from time to time, especially after working on PL/I 
code.  In my programs, I have a style rule that says that an empty 
statement of a for, while, do, or if statement must be coded as {} in order 
to show that the set of instructions to execute is empty.  (I also have the 
style rule that EVERY for, while, do, or if statement must have the object 
instruction(s) enclosed in braces -- I got this from Plauger's book and it 
has helped immensely.)
I'm looking at "indent" to see if it can recognize empty statements and 
convert the lone semicolon to {} so that this sort of thing becomes more 
obvious.
Linus would probably hate that...
