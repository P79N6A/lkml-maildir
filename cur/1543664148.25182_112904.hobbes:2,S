For patches that look ok and do not require feedback, I would suggest 
CC'ing your patches to David Miller, who is the net stack maintainer and 
seems to have been applying several of your patches so far.  Though "To: 
linux-kernel" gets your patch published, you typically want to find a 
"patch penguin" who will apply your patches and send them to 
Linus/Marcelo...
