not using capture file mode for this instantiation.  Sooner or later EXT(whatever) should
handle more than 32000 files in a single directory.   I will submit a patch to Andi and 
Andreas to review with this change.  May make some sense.  Since most folks install Linux 
on a clean system and really are not doing a lot of cross compatible FS swapping of 
hard drives, it really should be low impact if a system uses on-disk structures that 
are larger, provided they are not downgrading their system to an older kernel.  Using a
different partition type may be the easiest way to do this without casuing breakage across
linux kernels and EXT versions.
