Let kgdb refuse to access any addresses below TASK_SIZE. That's better than 
accidentally typing something and getting lost.
I guess preventing user address accesses is lesser evil compared to using a 
debugger global.
gdb itself may access user addresses in following scenarios. Not allowing user 
accesses doesn't hurt as gdb can accept that and recover gracefully.
1. When a function parameter contains a char pointer.
GDB prints the string pointed to by a function parameter when printing frame 
for the function. 
2. If a kernel variable points to a user string, print command will show its 
contents, unless user explicitely says print/x.
3. When a stack trace goes beyond an interrupt or an exception entrypoint:
The gdb at kgdb.sourceforge.net has some patchup for this problem, though it 
doesn't work all the time. Sometimes we do endup seeing one invalid stack 
frame for which gdb has accessed a user address.
