Sigh...
No, it wasn't legitimate.  As the matter of fact, _nothing_ outside of
parport/share.c has any business looking at the list of ports.  IOW,
parport_enumerate() should be removed regardless of the request_module()
crap.
In particular, parport_pc should keep track of the ports it had created
instead of messing with parport_enumerate().
