As a further data point, the test app triggers problems on x86 uniprocessor and 
SMP as well as arm uniprocessor.  On ppc64 we see the leap second being added, 
but it doesn't hang, while on ppc we don't even see the leap second being 
added--leading me to wonder if the leap second code even works for ppc32.
The above is all for modified 2.6.10.
