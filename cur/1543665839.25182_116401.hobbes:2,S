Thanks, I'll try to digest your comments and get back to you.

Nope, the timer_opts structure is i386 only. Further, the need for the
monotonic_clock() interface is because timer->get_offset() only returns
32bits of information, which on a 2Ghz cpu is only ~2 seconds worth of
time. We need multiple minutes worth of time to be returned, thus the 64
bit return of monotonic_clock. 
I considered making get_offset() return a 64bit value, but worried that
the cost of the 64bit math would hurt gettimeofday too much to be worth
it. So rather then complicate a heavily used function to handle a very
rare case, we decided to implement a new interface that doesn't need to
be as fast as gettimeofday, but can handle long periods of time w/o
interrupts.

I'm not sure I'm following this? get_offset returns the amount of time
since mark_offset() was called(last interrupt). The lost-jiffies
compensation code I added uses get_offset() to detect how many jiffies
should have passed. How do you suggest rolling it into get_offset?
thanks
