I don't think it can be.  This is for truncated locally-generated outgoing
packets, which can only happen when root is playing with raw sockets.
As you can probably tell, I was the one who wrote this printk :)  IMHO,
one reasonable complaint is sufficient to have it removed, so just remove
it.  If anyone thinks it's valuable, put a static counter < 5 around it
and add pid/comm info.
Cheers,
Rusty.
