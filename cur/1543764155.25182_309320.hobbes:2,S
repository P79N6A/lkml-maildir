One problem I just noticed, sorry. This is doing set_cpus_allowed
without holding the runqueue lock and without checking the hard
affinity mask either.
We could just do a set_cpus_allowed, or take the lock, set_cpus_allowed,
and take the new lock, but that's probably a bit heavy if we can avoid it.
In the interests of speed in this fast path, do you think we can do this
in sched_fork, before the task has even been put on the tasklist?
That would avoid all locking problems. Passing clone_flags into sched_fork
would not be a problem if we want to distinguish fork() and clone(CLONE_VM).
Yes? I'll cut a new patch to do just that.

This makes it a bit harder then, to get good stats in the sched-domain
(which is really what we want). It would basically mean doing
if (balance fork)
	schedstat_inc(sbf_cnt);
else if (balance exec)
	schedstat_inc(sbe_cnt);
etc.
That should all get optimised out by the compiler, but still a bit ugly.
Any ideas?
