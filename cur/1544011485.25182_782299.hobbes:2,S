It's never been rejected.  For a long time it has been in a state where
we're looking for the data which would allow us to agree that its
benefits are worth its costs.  AFAIK that has never really been
convincingly demonstrated.  Nor has the converse case been
demonstrated, so it floats in limbo.

Have you actually used cachefs/cachefiles for this?

OK, benchmarks are good.   But look:
 303 files changed, 21049 insertions(+), 3726 deletions(-)
it's an enormous hunk of code.  That will be in the kernel for ever and
ever, needing maintenance, adding additional burden to our effort to
evolve the kernel, etc.
Are any distros pushing for this?  Or shipping it?  If so, are they
able to weigh in and help us with this quite difficult decision?
