...and invalidate_complete_page2() calls try_to_release_page() which
again calls releasepage(). Success or failure of the latter should
therefore not depend on the internal fscache state.

In the case of a read-only file, yes. That is not true of a read/write
file.

Why should we add extra context switches for the non-fscache case? Just
move the call to nfs_readpage_to_fscache into its own kernel thread.
