I would assert that, at least in the case of the P4, there IS a "major 
core", as the 2 subcores share L1 and bus controller access, as well as 
several other parts of the chip.
I beleive this is to some extent the case in the Power4 modules - that 
each module contains resources shared by the execution units. However, I 
might be full of it, and since there are plenty of @ibm.com's here I 
expect to be corrected shortly....
