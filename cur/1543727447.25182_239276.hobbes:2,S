they don't let crazy people build stuff outside the tree as far as I know
... also they make you build against the current kernel headers, so we
would have to have the drm headers in include/linux/drm or somewhere like
that, and build the modules against them, but then what happens if you
want to build a new drm module out of tree..
two things make my head hurt, 32/64 interfaces and versioning.., maybe
some more experienced kernel heads could join this and tell us the best
way to go?
Dave.
