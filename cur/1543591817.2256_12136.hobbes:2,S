Ok, 200MB, let's see what this gives us as an example.
200MB multiplied by 6 PCI slots, which uses up about 1.2GB IOMMU
space.
This still leaves around 800MB IOMMU space free on that sparc64 PCI
controller.
It wouldn't run out of space, and this is assuming that Sun ever made
a sparc64 system with 6 physical PCI card slots (I don't think they
ever did honestly, I think 4 physical card slots was the maximum).
Later,
