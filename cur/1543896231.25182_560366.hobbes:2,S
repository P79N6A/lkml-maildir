I've recoded it and rediffed against -rc5 with the hibernation and suspend
patchset.  The resut is at
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/hibernation_and_suspend/2.6.22-rc5/patches/29-Optional-Beeping-During-Resume-From-RAM.patch
Well, my i386 test box doesn't seem to be able to beep at all.  I'll have to
look for another one ...
Greetings,
Rafael
