 Hmm, while this is different from what is documented in the MP Spec, it
looks like the 8254 IRQ is connected to INTIN0 indeed.  We can handle such
a setup if the BIOS reports routing correctly.  Since you invoke
io_apic_set_pci_routing() I assume you use ACPI for IRQ routing
information.  Can you please rebuild the kernel with APIC_DEBUG set to 1
in include/asm-i386/apic.h and send me the bootstrap log?  Can you please
send me the output of a tool called `mptable' as well, so that I can
compare the results?
