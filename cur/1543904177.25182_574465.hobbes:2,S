A fraction of *each* CPU, or a fraction of *total* CPU?  Per-cpu granularity 
doesn't make anything more fair.  You've got a big bucket of MIPS you want to 
divide between certain groups, but it shouldn't make a difference which CPUs 
those MIPS come from, other than the fact that we try to minimize overhead 
induced by migration.

If I have two threads with the same priority, and two CPUs, the scheduler will 
put one on each CPU, and they'll run happily without any migration or balancing. 
  It sounds like you're saying that every X milliseconds, you want both to 
expire, be forbidden from running on the current CPU for the next X 
milliseconds, and then migrated to the other CPU.  There's no gain in fairness 
here, and there's a big drop in performance.
I suggested local fairness as a means to achieve global fairness because it 
could reduce overhead, and by adding the margin of error at each level in the 
locality hierarchy, you can get an algorithm which naturally tolerates the level 
of unfairness beyond which it is impossible to optimize.  Strict local fairness 
for its own sake doesn't accomplish anything that's better than global fairness.
