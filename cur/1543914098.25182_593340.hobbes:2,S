True. I tried to unify the Makefile by using 
obj-$(CONFIG_X86_32) += ....
and
obj-$(CONFIG_X86_64) += ....
but I did fail due to link order problems in that code. I had not yet
time to go down and figure that out yet, but it is on my todo list.

Yes, if it is possible and makes sense.

We concentrated first on the move to make it simple and binary
equivalent. The cleanup of code (merging, location, makefile updates)
are definitely on our todo list.

Good point.
