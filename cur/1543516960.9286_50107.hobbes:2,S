IA32 SMP is Processor Ordered for WB memory (why would you use WT for
normal RAM anyway?), which essentially means the same thing as strong
ordering with the following caveat:
	Stores from one processor may not all be seen by other processors
	yet, though if any one store is observed by processor A on
	processor B, any earlier stores (in program order) from processor
	A are guaranteed to be observed by processor B.
In loose terms, each processor has a queue of committed stores that hasn't
made it to the outside world yet.  Once stores are observed by a processor,
the normal program ordering constraints apply.
IA32 is strongly ordered for UC (uncached) memory.
You could have memory-ordering #defines...  I.e. "#ifdef PROCESSOR_ORDERING",
"#ifdef WEAK_ORDERING", etc...  in general as you go to the weaker memory
orderings you have to add more code, anyway.

Make the variables "volatile" and the compiler is required by the ANSI
standard to not reorder them around sequence points (which the end-of-
statement delimiter is).
ALL SMP-visible or memory-mapped hardware variables should in general be
"volatile" to make sure you get exactly what you're asking for from the
compiler.

In IA32, (UC) Uncacheable memory is Strongly Ordered, compared to the
weaker case of Processor Ordering for Writeback (WB) memory (where stores
can be arbitrarily delayed from the other processors).  This means you
generally  get the appropriately intuitive result when surrounding, for
example, driver reads/writes (reads/writes to I/O space are also strongly
ordered) with normal loads and stores.
