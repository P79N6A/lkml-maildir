Interesting driver, it contains code that has been through a C
pre-processor. I wouldn't want to be the person who had try making it
run on non x86 hardware, they didn't even try to make it
portable. References PCI device registers directly not using the
readl/writel macros as one should, no memory barriers and it expects
operations like ptr->foo++ to be atomic - yummy, lotsa fun.
Oh and is the hardware really so bad that it requires spin locks to
protect the tx queue? (hint, where are the public docs? ;-)
Would be interesting to see how it performs against the Alteon and
Packet Engines cards, despite the broken license.
