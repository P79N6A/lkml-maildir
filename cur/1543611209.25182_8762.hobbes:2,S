For those interested, the patch is at
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/netdev-random
I want to point out that _without_ this patch, there are network devices
that feed the entropy pool.  In other words, this patch standardizes the
situation.
If you don't want net devices contributing, accept the default.
If you do, enable the configure setting and they all will contribute to
/dev/random.  This has uses in diskless/headless configurations, etc.
