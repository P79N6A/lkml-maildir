Serge (what a nice name!  ;-) ),
Let me give you an example where we found this patch very useful.
A 3rd party library that we bought implemented a user-level SCTP 
protocol by opening raw sockets.  This required our application to run 
as root.  However, we didn't want for it to run as root, and wanted to 
set the CAP_NET_RAW option and have the interaction with the raw socket 
survive after when we switch the effective user away from root.
When reading "man capabilities" we found:
"If  a  process  that has a 0 value for one or more of its user IDs 
wants to prevent its permitted capability set being cleared when it 
resets all of its user IDs to non-zero values, it can  do  so  using 
the  prctl() PR_SET_KEEPCAPS operation."
Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that this sentence says just 
what I described above.  If so, the previously attached patch has the 
behavior described in the man page.
Regards,
