Hi Ingo,
Here's another round of the pagetable unification patches.  I've done a
few dozen rounds of randconfig builds on both 32- and 64-bit, so I hope
that will prevent compile problems in your test environment.
I've also boot-tested 64-bit and 32-bit PAE/non-PAE configs (both paravirt
and non-paravirt).
Thanks,
	J
