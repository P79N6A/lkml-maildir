If you are using the modules from 2.6.23-rc1, try upgrading to latest 
-git, which contains a patch that might fix this problem.  If you are 
using the modules from kvm-33, try applying the attached patch.

    KVM: disable writeback for 0x0f 0x01 instructions.
    0x0f 0x01 instructions (ie lgdt, lidt, smsw, lmsw and invlpg) does
    not use writeback. This patch set no_wb=1 when emulating those
    instructions.
    This fixes a regression booting the FreeBSD kernel on AMD.
