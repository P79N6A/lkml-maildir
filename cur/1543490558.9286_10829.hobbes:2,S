Thanks. The main difference I can find is that you have modularized all
the drivers. And you have a real SCSI controller too. I just have IDE
drives.
My firmware release on the CRW-1622 is 2.3 your is 4.0. I will
flash-update the thing as soon as I get the chance. But it worked with
2.0.35.
My .config is attached...
Also tried ac4. Same result.
