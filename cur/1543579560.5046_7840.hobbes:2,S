It doesn't help with TCP, because the negotiated MSS will always be 1500
and thus there won't be any fragments to re-assemble.

There is another real-world case: a load-balancing proxy. socket->socket
sendfile would allow the proxy to open a non-keepalive connection to the
backend server, send the request, and then just link the two sockets
together using sendfile.
Of course, some changes would have to be made to the API. An asynchronous
sendsocket()/sendfile() system call would be just lovely, in fact. :-)
