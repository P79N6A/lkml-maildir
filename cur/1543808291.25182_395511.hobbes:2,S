Quite a big deal.  You might have 2Gigs of main memory, but your CPU is
unlikely to be more than a Megabyte in close reach.  A meg or two of
scheduler data and code means that your L1 and L2 cache will be cycling
every scheduler round; which is OK if you have very short runqueues but
as you get more and more processes it will really start to hurt.
Remember, systems today are memory bound and anything you can do to
reduce the amount of time the system sits around waiting for memory to
fetch, the better.
Compare that to the Token Bucket Scheduler of Linux-VServer; a tiny
struct for each process umbrella, that will generally fit in one or two
cachelines, to which the scheduling support adds four ints and a
spinlock.  With this it achieves fair CPU scheduling between vservers.
