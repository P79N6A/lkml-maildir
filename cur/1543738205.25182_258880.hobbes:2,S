I'm not sure about the question is suitable for list or not but I cannot 
find any information elsewhere.
When the CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE is set to No or system doesn't have a VGA 
controller, is it still possible to take keyboard input? For example, 
taking input from keyboard and displaying into a connected LCD display.
(I'm using 2.4.27 and I can't take input from keyboard)
