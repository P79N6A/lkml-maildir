Fair enough, I appreciate it's not a wide market segment right now.
It's not a quick and easy project though, so there's a long-ish ramp up time.
It would be nice to have it all working and in place by the time Hammer arrives 
and makes this much more widespread ;-) 
Just an order of magnitude figure for you ... number of seconds spent in kernel
space across all CPUs during a kernel compile on a 16-way NUMA-Q ... 
2.4 with every patch I had (including O(1) sched + NUMA mods) ... 120s. 
On 2.5.40-mm1 with one small NUMA scheduler patch ... 38s. 
Personally, I think that's pretty impressive - lots of very good things have been
happening, from Andrew in particular, the NUMA people, and VM people in general.
IMHO, the NUMA code is also much more readable and less buggy ;-)
