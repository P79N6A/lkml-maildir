IMHO support for all config space access methods should be added to the kernel.
And it should be added at a central point. Not waiting for drivers to do it
their own way if they need to use it.
The more complicated/important question is how to decide which access method
should be used for a device. (Something similar to the pci_mmcfg_fallback_slots
stuff that exists already for K8 NB.)
But that needs some more thinking.
Here a summary wrt family 10h extended config space access methods.
(Most of this stuff I verified with some patched kernels. I didn't
eavesdropping on the physical links though ...)
For family 10h we have 3 methods
(1) "legacy" MMCONFIG access (via south bridge)
(2) mmconfig access via CPU/NB (new with fam10h, using the new MMIO
    config base MSR)
(3) CF8/CFC ECS access (new with fam10h, has to be enabled in the NB_CFG MSR)
- If (1) is used  and (2)+(3) are not configurred there is no way to access
  NB config space with mmconfig accesses. Which implies that NB ECS cannot
  be accessed.
  So you can only access NB standard config space via "legacy" CF8/CFC.
  This equals what we have with K8.
  => ECS is accessible just for external devices (not the NB ECS).
- If (2) is used, mmconfig accesses are translated by CPU/NB. So this will
  result in (extended) config cycles on the link to the south bridge.
  This works for both NB config space and config space for normal PCI(e) devices.
  => ECS is accessible for all devices via that method.
- And finally with (3) you can also access both NB config space and the config
  space of external devices. The CPU/NB does the translation and will also
  create (extended) config cycles here.
  => ECS is accessible for all devices via that method.
  (But of course not in the same "atomic" manner like with mmconfig.)
Then we have different prereqs for those methods:
- For (1) the ACPI stuff is required.
- For (2) and (3) some MSRs have to be set up.
Ah, yes in case I didn't mention that: ;-)
Using (2) you haven't such a strict dependency on that ACPI stuff.
Would be cool to disable MCFG at all and configure mmconfig just in
the CPU, no?

Andreas
