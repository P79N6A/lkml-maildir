IMHO it does _not_ allow Linux behaviour:
----(Snipped from SUS)----
NAME
bind - bind a name to a socket
[...]
RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, bind() returns 0. Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno 
is set to indicate the error.
ERRORS
The bind() function will fail if:
[...]
[EADDRNOTAVAIL]
The specified address is not available from the local machine.
-----------------------------
So binding to a non-local ip address shouldnt be allowed because it "is not 
available from the local machine"; even if the machine has a dynamic ip.
