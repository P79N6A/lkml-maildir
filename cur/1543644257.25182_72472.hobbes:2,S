Hi all,
I'm quite new to the list and I'm not sure if this has been posted
already but I thought I would give it a shot. I've been trying to
build the 2.5.* kernels (2.5.37 at the moment but this has happened
with previous version as well) and when doing a make bzImage i keep
getting the following error during the final linkage:
<-- snip make entering and leaving individual driver directories with no
  errors -->

This is with gcc 3.1.1 on gentoo.
Also, is there a dependable link to searching the archives for this
list?  I found some on the faq page but the results were less than
useful.
Thanks in advance.
