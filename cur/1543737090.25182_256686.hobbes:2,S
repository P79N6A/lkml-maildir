In the cases I described the low latency flag
does not come into play because flush_to_ldisc()
is called directly instead of
through tty_flip_buffer_push().
TTY_DONT_FLIP is only set in read_chan().
If read_chan() is not running, TTY_DONT_FLIP is not
set and does not prevent buffers from flipping
if the ISR calls flush_to_ldisc() directly
while ldisc->receive_buf() is running.
The answer seems to be: don't call
flush_to_ldisc directly like the current
serial driver does.
