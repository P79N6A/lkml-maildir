As far as I can understand Andrew is ok with the merge. And I addressed all 
his comments.
Linus said:

As far as I can understand Linus _asked_ whether it was in -mm or not and whether
everybody's on the same page. He did not say "this must be in -mm first".
I explained that it has not been in -mm, and who it was discussed with, and did a 
bunch more testing/investigation on the controversial patch and explained why I think 
it's not that controversial any more.
Ingo said a few different things (a bit too large to quote). 
- That it was not discussed. I explained that it was in fact discussed and provided
a bunch of pointers to the mail threads.
- That he thinks that cpuset is the way to do it. Again I explained why it's not.
And at the end he said:
> Also, i'd not mind some test-coverage in sched.git as well.
I far as I know "do not mind" does not mean "must go to" ;-). Also I replied that 
I did not mind either but I do not think that it has much (if anything) to do with
the scheduler.
Anyway. I think I mentioned that I did not mind -mm either. I think it's ready for
the mainline. But if people still strongly feel that it has to be in -mm that's fine.
Lets just do s/Linus/Andrew/ on the first line and move on. But if Linus pulls it now
even better ;-)
Andrew, Linus, I'll let you guys decide which tree it needs to go.
