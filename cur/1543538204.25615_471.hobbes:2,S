Off topic I'm sorry..
OSF/1 and Hard Real Time.. I remember those days.
Indeed OSF/1 was touted as a HARD REAL TIME UNIX 
( small print .. single user / no network )
I first tried it 5 years ago and got a very interesing response from

Every now and again I get a reminder of how bad it all was before
Linux...
