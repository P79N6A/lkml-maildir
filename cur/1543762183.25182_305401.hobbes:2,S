Subject: error while implementing kill()

dear sir,
 I am unable to use the system call kill(pid,sig).I
have included the header file <signal.h>. I used it in
a module to kill a process. The module is compiling
properly but giving the following error while
inserting the module,
   unresolved symbol kill()
I am unable to track the bug here. 
kindly help me out.
I want to kill a process through the process ID inside
a module.
Is there any other approach other than using the
kill() function?
Thanks in advance,
sounak
