Let's see if I understand your intent: this new tree would be a better base
for things like -ac than the mainline Linus kernel.  It would always be a
single short branch off the latest mainline stable kernel.  It would probably
form a good base for vendor kernels and other stability-needed kernels, but by
itself wouldn't necessarily be at that level of predictability.
Does that accurately sum up what you're trying to get across?
