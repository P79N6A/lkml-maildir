Subject: System halted - or is it?  (2.4.19-pre10-ac2)

I'm using 2.4.19-pre10-ac2 on both my desktop and laptop now.  It works
great, with one "interesting" exception: on halt, it first stops the RAID on
my desktop (lots of messages about invalidating busy buffers here), then
flushes all IDE devices, and then prints System Halted... and then gives me
back my shell prompt.  The system appears to still work, at least for
trivial operations.  The shell is definitely still running.
Any ideas?
