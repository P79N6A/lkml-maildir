Hi,
I just had to switch my gateway back to 2.0.36 after finding masquerading under 2.2.x extremely unreliable.
What I found was:
- ICMP packet loss up to 30% when pinging or doing traceroute
- UDP Masquerading goin' weird when src port = dst port or src port < 1024 (couldn't figure out which of these)
- 75% throughput with my ISDN line, lots of timeouts, dropped connections and the like
everything was rock solid again when booting back to 2.0.36 the same day, and if it had been a network outage, somebody else would have noticed...
btw, switching a SuSE 6.1 back to a 2.0.x kernel is really a pain in the ass :-(
bye
	Mathias
