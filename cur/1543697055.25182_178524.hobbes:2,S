I wasn't aware that such performance issues were divorced.  In my 
admitted limited view, a laggy mouse is a laggy mouse, and its due to 
irq latency in achieving the context switch to service the mouses 
data.  To me, its sorta like 2=2. :)

Ok Nick.  I'll reboot tomorrow without the elevator argument.  Right 
now, amanda is fixin to be fired off in about 25 minutes and I want 
to see how badly its estimate phase hogs the machine using the cfq 
scheduler.  With the -mm2 as, it was almost psychedelic to watch the 
mouse move.
Also off topic re mouse performance, and I expect this is an X issue, 
but when its been blanked because I'm typing, it takes about a full 
seconds worth of hand waving before it becomes visible again.  This 
is an X issue and I should go away, right?

So beit.  I guess I must be one of those. (-:
