Can you please provide the boot log from 2.6.17 and one with the
following patch on top of 2.6.17-mm2 applied:
http://www.tglx.de/private/tglx/linux-2.6.17-mm2-revert-genirq.diff
It reverts the genirq changes. When the unexpected IRQ trap messages
persist, we know that it's unrelated to genirq. Otherwise, sigh
Thanks,
