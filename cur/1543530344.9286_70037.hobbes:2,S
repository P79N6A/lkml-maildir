I don't know what's wrong with your machines, but if it IS due to them
running out of memory somewhere, Rik's patch will help you; if not,
neither it nor any other change to the VM system will help.
If you ARE running into OOM (out-of-memory) problems in 2.2.x which didn't
happen in 2.0.x, I would guess something developed a memory leak between
the two. Try watching a box with "top" until it dies, and see what
happens.
