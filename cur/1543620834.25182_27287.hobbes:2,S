Subject: [PATCH] unclip large disks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The purpose of CONFIG_IDEDISK_STROKE is to make the setmax
utility superfluous. However, I find that unclipping large
disks fails because idedisk_read_native_max_address_ext()
is called before probe_lba_addressing(), which means that
drive->addressing is not yet set, and the high order part
of the disk size is not read.
Thus, probe_lba_addressing() should be moved up in ide-disk.c,
for example

[this was for some variant on linux-2.4.18-pre7-ac3,
but no doubt a similar patch applies to all kernels
with IDE patch]
