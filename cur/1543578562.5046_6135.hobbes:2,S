Well that "experimental patch" is designed to get out of the dreaded
"DMA Timeout Hang" or deadlock that is most noted by the PIIX4 on the
Intel 440*X Chipset groups.  Since it appears that their bug was copied
but other chipset makers......you see the picture clearly, right?

Well since I do not have VIA boards and Vojtech Pavlik <vojtech@suse.cz>
is doing that chipset, take that issue to him.  VIA has always been a HACK
fro mthe beginning because it was written off the whitepapers that stink.
The AMD and HPT366 code were to be in 2.4.0 release, but the early
surprize caused most to be off guard.
I will pull the TIMEOUT but this is one you have bitched me out before
about not fixing or attempting to fix.  You can not have it both ways.
This is why I made it a compile option and not default.  I have one report
that it does not help....thus I changed it to a compile option.  Yes one
report took it from mainstream to option.
Cheers,
