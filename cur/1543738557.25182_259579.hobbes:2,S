Ermmm, indeed, that's quite possible :-{ I've been lured by the MAC
address, which was correct. But that didn't mean anything.
The problem is that once the freebox is disconnected from the xDSL line,
it becomes completely silent on the network. nmap -O -P0 is meaningless.
It does seem to act like a bridge, indeed.

No, my computer doesn't look like that.
I have asked Free for more information about the OS running on the
freebox. I don't know what kind of tests could be performed on such a
device. If you have any suggestion.
