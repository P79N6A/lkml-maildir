It causes problem, as most platform files, for example,
arch/ppc/platforms/katana.c, still use the old name without ".". I do
not understand why bus_id "mpsc.0" is better than "mpsc0".
Please explain what is the benefit of introducing such a change,
before I can submit a patch for all those platform files to work with
this change.
Please CC me, as I am currently not in the list.
Thanks,
