Ok, sleeping is a case apart, it has some limitations.
(Mingo is working on a method for sleeping down to 1ms in non-busywaiting mode)
But other syscalls work just nicely:
for example in my latencytest ( PCM audio), the 
write() to /dev/dsp returns after 30-50 usecs if the audio buffer is empty, or 
if after an entire fragment is freed ( you can use 1ms fragments, and it works
just nicely)

Jaroslav says this is a TX FIFO limitation of the MPU401 hardware,
so the only solution is to poll the FIFO with a bigger frequency.

Benno.
