hi Alan,
Thanks for the comments.

Yup, understood.  I was punting that it would need to appear
in the kernel headers first though, so thought I'd test the
water with you guys and try to understand the process for such
a change.
The "unknown error" messages can't really be avoided in all cases
anyway - even when there is a coordinated libc release there will
always be (the vast majority of?) people running new kernels with
older libc versions for awhile ... thats life though, I guess, if
there's no other solution to the problem.

For ENOATTR, an error code is needed which doesn't conflict
with any other used in the filesystem, so that a failure to
get/set/... an extended attribute can be distinguished from
other errors related to looking up the pathname initially,
as an example.

Yeah, the semantics here are slightly different, but perhaps we
can get away with this... (Steve?  do you know of any cases in
the code where we need to be able to distinguish the EIO value
from EFSCORRUPTED?  or any other reason why this wouldn't work?
It is the obvious one - I'd imagine there was a reason for not
using it originally).

Yes, that wasn't being suggested.

Yup - understood.
thanks.
