Well, in case of a semaphore it is a semantically correct use case. In
case of of a mutex it is not.
Gerd was talking about a mutex. The fact that a mutex is implemented on
top (or on actually the same) mechanism as a semaphore - for what ever
reason - does not change the semantical difference between semaphores
and mutexes.
