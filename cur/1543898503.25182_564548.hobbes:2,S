It's the same answer as in most filesystem related questions...it
depends ;)  Consistent state means many different things.  It may mean
that the metadata accurately reflects the space on disk allocated to
the file and that all data for the file is properly on disk (ie from an
fsync).
But, even this is less than useful because very few files on the
filesystem stand alone.  Applications spread their state across a
number of files and so consistent means something different to
every application.
Getting a snapshot that is useful with respect to application data
requires help from the application.  The app needs to be shutdown or
paused prior to the snapshot and then started up again after the
snapshot is taken.
