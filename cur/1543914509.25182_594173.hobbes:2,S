Steven,
what stops vendors of using the current existing code to achieve that
goal. They could provide binary drivers with the existing API.
What stops companies to intercept the ioctl calls and overriding some
I2C commands?
Since you know about windows drivers (at least I think that you know
about it) you might know about the limitations of the v4l/dvb API
in general the reason just put as much code as possible into the
kernel just for forcing companies to release code under GPL doesn't
seem to be valid.
How about proprietary video formats, would you also place the decoding
algorithms in kernel  just to force companies to release their code
for it?
What do you think about the existing usbfs implementation, which
allows to implement usb drivers completly in userspace?
What do you think about IOMMU?
please answer those questions.
thanks,
Markus
