for the 80 col limit, that's up to the author.  if Adrian is happy with it as 
is, that's fine.

i'd tend to agree it does make it easier to read, however you didnt make it 
inline which means gcc may not inline it which means there's pointless 
overhead of doing a function call.
otherwise, arbitrary breaking on 80 cols actually makes the code harder to 
read for no gain.
