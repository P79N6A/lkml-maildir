I really doubt if any of those paths could be called before
even the MMU is set up.
It seems that the ia64 port has installed some console drivers,
and has then called them before it is ready to do so.  Via printk.
It should not have installed the console drivers that early.  Do
you know what console driver is causing the problem?
If the console driver is not fixable then a more general approach
would be, in printk.c:
#ifndef ARCH_HAS_PRINTK_MAY_BE_USED
#define printk_may_be_used() (1)
#endif
then, in printk() itself:
                if (*p == '\n')
                        log_level_unknown = 1;
        }
+	if (!printk_may_be_used())
+		return printed_len;
        if (!down_trylock(&console_sem)) {
                /*
then, for ia64, give it a printk_may_be_used() function, and
define ARCH_HAS_PRINTK_MAY_BE_USED somewhere.
Or just not install console drivers before they may be safely
used!
