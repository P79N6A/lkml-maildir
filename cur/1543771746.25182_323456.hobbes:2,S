 I think this is my first ever post to l-k.
I'm scared.
I've been trying desperately to get suspend-to-ram working on my new 
inspiron 6000.
So far, the patch at
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/23/116
Got the hard disk working after resume, and at least the b44 ethernic 
keeps working, but the display doesn't.  No amount of vbetool voodoo 
seems to bring it back up
Turns out the PCI config for the card gets trashed:

It's an ATI radeon M300, on a PCI-X bridge I think.
Is this a kernel issue or an X issue?  I vaguely recall some pci config 
save/restore hack floating around somewhere, should I try that?
This is ubuntu breezy, using xorg and kernel image 2.6.11.93-1.1
Mick.
