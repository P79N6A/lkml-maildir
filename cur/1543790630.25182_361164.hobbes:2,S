There seems to be some regression here:
System: 4P Xeon
Test:Result Group 8
Metric: 64KB_4_fread
Result:      +1.9%         -15%
Kernel: 2.6.14-rc4 vs 2.6.14-rc4-git4
System: 2P Xeon
Test:Result Group 7
Metric: ODIRECT
Kernel: 2.6.14-rc5 vs 2.6.14-rc5-git3
Summary: Write has increased whereas Read has decreased by 4-5 %
Any thoughts?
regards,
Felix
