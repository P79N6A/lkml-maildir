Sometimes.  Sometimes it's valid though - allocating (small amounts of)
per-cpu storage, summing up per-cpu counters (poorly), etc.

Nope, I'll change this to
#define for_each_cpu(cpu)	  for_each_cpu_mask((cpu), cpu_possible_map)
#define for_each_possible_cpu(cpu)  for_each_cpu_mask((cpu), cpu_possible_map)
So both are valid.  That way
a) The kernel continues to compile at each step of the patch series
   (important!) and
b) We can remove for_each_cpu() later on, after all the various
   out-of-tree usages have been converted.
