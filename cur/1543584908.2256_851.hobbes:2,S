That's a separate issue.
I guess the pagefault path should have _2_ locks.
One mmap_sem protecting read-only access to the address space
and another one for write access to the adress space (to stop
races with swapout, other page faults, ...).
At the point where the pagefault sleeps on IO, it could release
the read-only lock, so vmstat, top, etc can get the statistics
they need. Only during the time the pagefaulting code is actually
messing with the address space could it block read access (to
prevent others from seeing an inconsistent state).
regards,
Rik
