That may be (though I don't think so) but it reproduces without
PTRACE_KILL too.  Try the attached, which just replaced PTRACE_KILL
with PTRACE_CONT/tkill(pid, SIGKILL).  Still get zombies.  I haven't
tried reproducing entirely without ptrace yet.

I doubt there was a good reason.  This code hasn't changed in a hell of
a long time - it probably predates everything up there except sigaddset
:).
