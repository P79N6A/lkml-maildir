It is too fluffy.

The OS-API is *one* file descriptor where you can read, write, mmap, ...
on. Therefore stream selection must happen with open() since open()
returns a fd (which uniquely identify a stream). Voila.
And actually this makes transition actually possible: Old apps simply
ignore streams (yes, there will be a default stream, which is used id
nothing else is specified) and throw them away (think of e.g. patch
which opens a new file, writes into it, unlink's the old one and mv's
the new one on the old place) until they are modified to support them.
