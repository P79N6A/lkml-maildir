The harm is not the locking overkill, but instead the fact that during the
locked-atomic region we have the cpu __cli()ed.
And the _only_ reason we need the cpu clied in order to do the locking
safe, is that all places are currently looping infinitely on their lock
(in this case a -spin-lock) and not always-taking a fail-safe path.
I think instead that all places that could run in a irq handler should do:
struct semaphore scsi_sem = MUTEX;
scsi_done()
{
	if (down_trylock(&scsi_sem))
	{
		queue_task();
		return;
	}
	/* lock held */
	up(&scsi_sem);
}
and places that can be recalled only from normal kernel context (I
think none in the scsi code though ;) should do:
	down()
	/* Critical section */
	up();
That way we would _never_ need the cpu clied.
Comments?
