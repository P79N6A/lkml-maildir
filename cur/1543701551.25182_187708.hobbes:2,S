Why do you need to hijack system calls from a module? 99% of the
times, it's the wrong technical solution.

There is no such Linus recommended way. For 2.6, syscalltrack's hijack
module moved into the kernel and will provide such generic
functionality one day. But I don't anticipate it every going into the
vanilla kernel, due to Linus's well known objections to syscall
hijacking in general and making it convenient in particular.
