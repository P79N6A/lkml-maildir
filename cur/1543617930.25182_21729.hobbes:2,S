Last time this was discussed on the list, Tigran Aivazian mentioned this
patch:
http://www.moses.uklinux.net/patches/forced-umount-2.4.9.patch
I haven't tested it, but it seems better than "fuser -k -m /fs" (and the
problem I've faced is that if there's something wrong (like HW level IO
problems) kill -KILL won't work).
