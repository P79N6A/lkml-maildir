What's completely unreasonable is that they patented something they damn
well knew has existed for decades. Yes, it's a neat trick that they were
able to do it with Linux with low overhead, but people have been using
UNIX as guests atop VM layers for a long time, and guess what? They've
been doing realtime interrupt processing on those same machines. Hell,
there are half a dozen products that do this with DOS and Windows that
predate RTLinux, like iRMX. In fact, look no further than the PC on your
desk's power switch which triggers an interrupt in so-called system
management mode - effectively a real-time layer that pre-empts your OS.
This has been in laptops in some form or another since at least the
386SLC.
Same goes for this "embedded protocol objects" patent. The patent is so
vague about what it's actually patenting that it certainly runs afoul of
the zero-copy buffering scheme from the IO-Lite paper we all read a few
years ago, never mind simple readv/writev (and your own IO-doohickeys!).
