ksymoops -v /usr/src/linux/vmlinux -s map < /dev/null
will save the complete map including modules.  _stext/_etext are the
bounds of the program text.  Next you get the data, types D and d.
That is followed by __init_begin/__init_end, this is allocated when the
kernel starts then the area is discarded and reused for kmalloc after
initialization.  Next is BSS, from __bss_start to _end.  _end is the
end of the static kernel but remember to allow for the hole where
__init data is reused.
