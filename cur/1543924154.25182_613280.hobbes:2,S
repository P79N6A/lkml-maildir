You don't know how much you will need.  I exhausted the limit on
sparc64 very late in the boot process when the last few userland
services were starting up.
And if I subsequently bring up 100,000 IP tunnels, it will exhaust the
per-cpu allocation area.
You have to make it fully dynamic, there is no way around it.
