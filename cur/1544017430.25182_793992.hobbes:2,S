Unfortunately I only saved that snippet of the log (I can provide you a full dmesg but it won't be
from a run where this problem occured).

I believe it is a USRobotics ADSL modem (nmap reckons its a SureConnect 9105 but I have no means of checking as I don't have physical access to the box where it is contained). Every now and again this thing seems to buckle under network load and goes out to lunch. When this happens ethtool reports that the line has dropped and sometimes this warning appears...
