I know. Not yet.
As I've written some lines below, there is a patch:
http://www.saout.de/misc/dm-crypt.diff
 that I've written some time ago.
I posted it some time ago but never got feedback from any "VIP" (except
for Joe Thornber who helped developing the target and thinks it looks
good). Some people tested it though and it worked for them (and better
than cryptoloop around test4).
