Personally, I think
	proc_printf(fragment, "%d %d",get_portnum(usbdev), usbdev->maxchild);
(or the string "dddd ddd" with d representing a digit)
is shorter (and faster) to parse with
	fscanf(input,"%d %d",&usbdev,&maxchild);
Than it would be to try parsing
	<usb:topology port="ddddd" portnum="dddd">
with an XML parser.
Sorry - XML is good for some things. It is not designed to be a
interface language between a kernel and user space.
I am NOT in favor of "one file per value", but structured data needs
to be written in a reasonable, concise manner. XML is intended for
communication between disparate systems in an exreemly precise manner
to allow some self documentation to be included when the communication
fails.
Even Lisp S expressions are easier :-)
