I have always wondered how Windows got it right circa 1995 - Version after 
version, several different hardwares and it always works reliably. 
I am using Linux since 1997 and not a single time have I succeeded in getting 
it to suspend and resume reliably. 
Is it such an un-interesting subject to warrant serious effort or there is a 
lot of hardware documentation missing or in general the driver model and OS 
design itself makes it impossible to get suspend / resume right?
