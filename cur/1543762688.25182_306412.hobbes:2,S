Well, it boils down to the full sourcecode. NVidia does only half.
Other good examples besides 3ware are: VMware kernel modules and
SUNWut/SRSS3 Linux Kernel modules.
Looks like there's only the GPU industry left that thinks somebody could 
"mis"use the kmod to make them (:one company) inferior on the market.
