I always do that (well, almost always), just because it protects macros 
from being mis-used.
For example, if you have
	#define macro(x) ((x) = 3)
that _looks_ safe, but it allows people to write
	x++ = macro(x);
or similar nonsense. So if you want a macro that always behaves like a 
statement (and can't be used as an expression), the "do { } while (0)" 
will do that.
[ The real answer is that it's so built in to my spine, that I just can't 
  stop myself. Even if it doesn't really matter. ]
