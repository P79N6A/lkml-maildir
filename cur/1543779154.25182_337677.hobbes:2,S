The current patch only outputs the memory policy via
smaps/emaps. However, this could be construet as a single string
describing the policy.
From my earlier post:
default                 -> Reset allocation policy to default
prefer=<node>           -> Prefer allocation on specified node
interleave={nodelist}   -> Interleaved allocation on the given nodes
bind={zonelist}         -> Restrict allocation to the specified zones.
Zones are specified by either only providing the node number or using the
notation zone/name. I.e. 3/normal 1/high 0/dma etc.
