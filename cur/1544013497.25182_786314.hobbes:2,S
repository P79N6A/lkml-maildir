Yes but these are both symptoms of the same problem.

I don't believe "auto-destroy my music collection" is a sane default...

A per file system sync and quiesce is I think also part of the
requirement. Having the file system media consistent but still mounted
before suspending is a good thing anyway (especially with stuff like USB
keys that people do then go and remove post suspend) and you can put the
device into a consistent state and revalidate it *regardless* of the
whether it is / or a music player. What you do if revalidating / fails is
another question ;)
