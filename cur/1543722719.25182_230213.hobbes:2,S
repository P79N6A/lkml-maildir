We don't really have an option here.  None of the distros I know of will
currently work with dynamic minors for the console device.  If we only use
dynamic minors, our driver will simply not work with most of the
distributions.
I don't want a driver that will break our console - I want one that will
make it work better.  Dynamic minors, at least today, will just break us.
Plus, as I said before, LANANA's web page states they don't accept
submissions for the 2.6 kernel.  What are we to do?
Thanks.
