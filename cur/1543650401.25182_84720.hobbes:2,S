You have two ways to know if "something" changed. You call everyone each
time and you ask him if his changed, or you call everyone one time by
saying "call me when you're changed". It's behind the "call me when you're
changed" phrase that lays the concept of edge triggered APIs. So, pretty
evidently, the answer to your question is : efficency.
