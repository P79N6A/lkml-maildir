Ah, I'm glad I stumbled on this message because I was just getting
ready to make an argument about why setting ->i_size shouldn't be done
in vmtruncate, at least not before the fs-specific truncate is done. 
OK, I'll summarize here anyway: as it stands, a valuable piece of
information - the previous size of the file - is getting stepped on
just before inode->i_op->truncate(inode) gets called.  This leads to
some messy posturing if you need to know the old size before going to
the new size.
The clean solution would be:
  inode->i_op->truncate(inode, offset);
Which means changing every filesystem, and also breaking out-of-kernel
filesystems, albeit in a nice easy-to-understand way.
Setting ->i_size could then be done as the last step in vmtruncate, or
the fs could could do it and vmtruncate could check to ensure it was
done - it doesn't make much difference.  But having the old size
available does make an awful lot of difference.
Is this change imminent/done, or should I go ahead and do my
just-for-now workaround?
