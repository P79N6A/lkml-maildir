Note: the nfs_inode_lock is not in itself part of any 'fix'. It is
merely a substitute for the current BKL protection of attribute
updates on NFS. The BKL gets dropped from NFS + rpciod in the patch
linux-2.4.x-rpc_bkl.dif which is, of course, included in NFS_ALL.

This is the long term solution. We will in any case want to make the
RPC layer 'page aware' in order to be able to make use of the
zero-copy socket stuff (a.k.a. sendpage()).
I'm still not ready to detail exactly how it should be done
though. I'll have to get back to you on this one...
Cheers,
   Trond
