I am concerned about the automatic fallback to the PIT when no other
clock source is available. A clocksource read would be atomic when TSC
or HPET are available, but would fall back on PIT otherwise. There
should be some way to specify that a caller is only interested in atomic
clock sources (if none are available, the call should simply return an
error, or 0).
I still think that an RCU style update mechanism would be a good way  to
fix the current clocksource read issue. Another, slower and non NMI
safe way to do this would be with a read seqlock and with IRQ disabling.
