/lib/modules/`uname -r`/
	modules.dep
	modules.pcimap
	System.map
	.config
	Any other text files that are kernel specific
	build symlink
	kernel/ modules that came from the kernel source tree
	pcmcia/ modules from external pcmcia package
	xyz/ modules from third party xyz package, e.g. vmware
The old method of mixing multiple sources into fs/, drivers/ net/ etc.
made it impossible to clean out old kernel modules automatically during
make modules_install.  A common class of problem was caused by old
modules when somebody changed an option from a module to in kernel but
did not clean out the old modules first.  Not any more.
The old modules_install method relied on human definition of the
mapping from source tree to fs/, net/, misc/ etc.  Kernel developers
got this wrong all the time, which is why half the modules incorrectly
ended up in misc/.  Even worse, you could have multiple copies of
modules, on in say fs/, the other in misc/ and you never knew which one
was being used.  Not any more.
