OK, whatever.  But are you planning on trying to reformat the kernel and
get that pushed into the mainline?  That's a fool's errand for lots of 
reasons.  Nobody is going to get excited about having to look through 
tons of patches which are all white space changes.  And it screws up
the revision history.  Annotated listings and being able to go from that
to the patch are a nice thing.  If you get all this stuff applied you 
are hiding the real authorship of each of these function declarations.
