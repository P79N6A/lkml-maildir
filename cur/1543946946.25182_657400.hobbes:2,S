sure, feel free to experiment with those details.
But if you want to improve Java workloads then you should probably start 
by converting them to futexes instead of sched_yield(), that will 
probably give far more performance than micro-optimizing the 
sys_sched_yield() codepath. (especially when it happens at the expense 
of other workloads, which is not acceptable for mainline) You can 
rebuild your JVM easily and re-test with its locking fixed, right?
