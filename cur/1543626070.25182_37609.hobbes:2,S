If you take the sizeof based on the type of the actual variable is using, 
you're guaranteed to get the right result.  (The type information is only in 
one place, so what the compiler's using and what you're reserving space for 
have to be the same thing.)
If you sizeof( ) the type and declare the type of the variable seperately, 
you have the possibility of version skew between them.  The sizeof( ) and the 
variable declaration itself may not match.  Hence bugs.
