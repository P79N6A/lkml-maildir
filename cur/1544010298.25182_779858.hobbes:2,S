Hmph, it seems to be in the noise (I'm testing with an AMD system
though). Some boots SLAB is faster, other boots, SLQB is. Could be
a matter of luck in cacheline placement maybe?
I think this benchmark (after the slab rcu patch) will be pretty
trivial for any slab allocator because it will basically be each
CPU allocating then freeing an object.
