Agreed.  
And the simple fact of Linus using BitKeeper does the
_exact_ _same_ _thing_.
Talk Linus out of using BitKeeper, and sure, I'll remove the doc.

No, it is not comparable at all with that.  There are no license
problems with the document -- it is GPL'd.
It describes the same thing as Documentation/SubmittingPatches does, and
is very relevant to kernel development.

Removing the doc from the kernel sources would be a token gesture only.
Some developers disagree violently with the use of non-open-source tools
at all, and that is a fundamental disagreement.
The majority of the "silently seething" developers, I imagine, are only
gonna be satisfied when (a) BitKeeper is GPL'd or (b) Linus stops using
BitKeeper.  Both of these seem very remote possibilities at present.

P.S.  The doc is _not_ going on the BK website by my hand.  (though I
have given BitMover permission to post the doc whereever they wish)
I can maintain my own docs much better than Larry can :)
