A simple list of working and nonworking devices:
Works:
* Logitech MouseMan Optical Dual
* Apple Pro Keyboard
* Iomega ZIP 100
Works not:
* TerraCAM USB Pro: (ov511 v2.28)
drivers/usb/media/ov511.c: init isoc: usb_submit_urb(0) ret -38
* USB-to-Serial (pl2303)
pl2303_open - failed submitting interrupt urb, error -28
Perhaps a driver programming bug?
Cheers,
