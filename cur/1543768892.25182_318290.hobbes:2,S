what do you mean "a year or two"?  processors have been doing this for 
many years now.
i'm biased, but i still think transmeta did this the right way... the tsc 
operates at the top frequency of the processor always.
i do a hell of a lot of microbenchmarking on various processors and i 
always use tsc -- but i'm just smart enough to take multiple samples and i 
try to make each sample smaller than a time slice... which avoids most of 
the pitfalls, and would even work on smp boxes with tsc differences.
