As an update to the messages I've been posting about running Galactic 
Civ in Wine on the 260 series:
260-test2-mm5 seems quite nice.
When programs are intially run (ie. Nautilus, OpenOffice etc. as well as 
Galciv in wine) there can be minor stuttering and some long delays but 
once the software is up, it can be switched back and forth with little 
problem. (When initially starting up even the movies ran fine without 
pauses)
There can be some minor stuttering when flipping between apps but it 
seems to smooth out after using a particular app for awhile which I 
would guess is the adpative nature of the scheduler?
