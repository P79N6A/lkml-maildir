The help is remarkably unhelpful "Support for dcss block device".
Google has never heard of "dcssblk" and for "dcss" suggests:
- Digital Consulting and Software Services
- Department of Child Support Services
- Division of Child Support Services
- Dave Culp Speedsailing
- "DeCSS" (for DVDs) misspelled.
- Dougherty County School System
- Distributed Control Systems
- Direct + Club Sales Server
- Distributed Control System Server
  (Hey, it's a sort of device driver - for the X-ray crystallography
  system at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.)
... anyway, after a bit of source-tree grepping it turns out to be in
srivers/s30 and stand for "Discontiguous Shared Segment", which
appears to be IBM-ese.
Perhaps drivers/s390/Kconfig could have another "depends on ARCH_S390"
line added?
