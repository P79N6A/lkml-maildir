Yah, I guess it ought to go lower, so long as sysfs is sufficiently
mounted before it runs.
The reason I put it at 20 was that it really does not matter.  udev is
not a functional replacement for a static /dev while we do not have
initramfs.  Once we have udev working during early boot, we won't need
the initscripts.

Makes sense.

Because if you have your udev on a persistent storage media (e.g., ext3,
like most of us) then it is nice to clear it out across reboots.
