First double unlikely in a condition is useless. Just drop them.
And then ->is_xyz() in a generic vops interface is about as ugly
and non generic as you can get. dma_alloc_coherent is not performance
critical, so you should rather change the interface that ->alloc_coherent
is always called and the other handlers handle the !mmu case correctly.
In fact they need that already I guess (e.g. on DMAR there is not really
a nommu case)
