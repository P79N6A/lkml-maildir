Certainly.  If hardware-change events can get lost because of the
system sleep, the resume method should make every effort to verify that 
what it remembers of the hardware state matches the current reality.

It depends on the bus.  If the bus doesn't support hotplugging then 
scanning isn't necessary.  If the bus does support hotplugging then 
scanning after suspend may or may not be necessary, depending on 
whether or not the bus controller remained powered during the suspend.  
For hotpluggable buses, scanning after hibernation is always necessary.
