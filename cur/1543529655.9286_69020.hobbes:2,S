   This doesn't mean that overcommit is a good idea. It just means that
fork()/exec() is not a good way of launching programs. Using overcommit to
cover up for fork()/exec() deficiencies is like redirecting compiler
warnings to /dev/null instead of fixing the code. The symptoms become less
visible but the problem remains. The problem could be solved by introducing
a new system call with the ability to start an external program as a new
process.
