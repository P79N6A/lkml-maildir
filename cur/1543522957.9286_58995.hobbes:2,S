I need the same things You need, I'd like if this patch will be tested to
discover :
1) Performance loss ( if any ) under low wordload
2) Performance gain ( if any ) under high wordload
I don't have testing suites ( other than mine ) and hardware to do this, so
I'd like if someone will give
the patch a real test.
Cheers,
    Davide.
