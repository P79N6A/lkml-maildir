Subject: [PATCH] limit process tree depth
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/3/8/84

Description    : Limit the depth of the process tree
Kernel version : 2.6.3
URL            : 
http://oss.digirati.com.br/fkdepth/
This patch provides limiting facility over the creation of children
processes.
That means if a process depth is set to:
  0 - it can't fork.
  1 - it can fork, but its children can't.
  2 - the process and its children can fork, but its grandchildren can't.
  3 - etc.
It's done using the rlimit framework, which makes the patch really small.
One application is to stop the following exploit:
Mod_php under apache httpd 2.0.x leaks a critical file descriptor that can be
used to hijack the https service. To do so, the proccess needs to fork and
deamonize itself. By setting his process depth to 0 or 1, it just can't
deamonize.
This patch only shows the changes for i386 arch to reduce this mail size,
full
version (all archs) can be found at URL.
Since it's my very first patch attempt I hope I haven't messed it up. Any 
comments and sugestions are appreciated.
Marco
