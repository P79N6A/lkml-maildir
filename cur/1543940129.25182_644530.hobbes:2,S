well, here on Mandriva I
1) compile both IDE and libata as modules
2) create initrd that contains either IDE or libata modules
3) use labels for file system mounts, swaps and resume device.
Now 1) should be pretty straightforward (I could send you config if you
like, it is stripped down to bare minimum on my system, you will have to
check drivers for your hardware). 2 and 3 are obviously distribution
dependent. I can explain how to do it on Mandriva that ATM has near to
perfect support for addressing devices via label/UUID; also ide/scsi/ata
switch is trivial using Mandriva mkinitrd.
