well the idea that has been tossed about a few times is using a vsyscall
function that either calls into the kernel, or directly uses the hpet
page (which can be user mapped) to get time information that way... 
or even would use rdtsc in a way the kernel knows is safe (eg corrected
for the local cpu's speed and offset etc etc).
