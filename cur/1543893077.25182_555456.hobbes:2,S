According to your system description it seems that you have a
Targa Visionary laptop with a VIA chipset and a Mobile Athlon64.
If so, then you probably have the same problem I reported some time
ago: see <
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=117681226421346&w=2>
and the followup messages. The conclusion was that the chipset's
ACPI PM timer slows down when the CPU is in C2.
The workaround is to boot with processor.max_cstate=1.
