We don't provide the binutils or gcc with the kernel either.  The 6502
is a rather well known processor.  Try plonking "6502 assembler" in
google and you'll have a lot of choice.
Having the source with the .h helps doing this little thing called
debugging.
  OG, who hates acenic_firmware.h for that exact same reason.
