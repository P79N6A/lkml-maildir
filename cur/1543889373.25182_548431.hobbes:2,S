OK, so something is touching one of your HID devices through hiddev, and 
tries to push through it something that doesn't comply to the report 
descriptor of the device. Are you aware of any userspace daemons running 
which would touch /dev/hiddev*? (acupsd, nut, hid2hci, etc.).
Just for clarification, does situation get any better when you disable 
hidraw, which I see you have enabled? (if that doesn't help, testing with 
hiddev disabled should also be interesting - that would avoid the 
possibility that userspace mocks the device up through hiddev).

This BTW needs a separate bugreport.

This is pretty strange. Mouse shouldn't be claimed by hiddev. Seems like 
this mouse probably has some "interesting" HID report descriptor. Could 
you please recompile with CONFIG_HID_DEBUG enabled and send me the output?

This also needs a separate report.
Do you please have any indication which kernel versions were OK with the 
same .config, with respect to the USB mouse/keyboard hogs you are seeing 
with 2.6.22-rc2-mm1?
Thanks,
