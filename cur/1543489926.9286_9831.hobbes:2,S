It's done this way to avoid using the same addresses as have been allocated
to PCI devices needs, as well as some of the unallocated-but-always-present
ISA devices, like the VGA aperture at 0xa0000 - 0xbffff.
For example, say you have the VGA framebuffer starting at 128Mb (0x08000000)
with 4Mb size, and a SCSI device is told to transfer data to memory at
0x08002000. Both the DMA window *and* the framebuffer will try to respond to
the addresses, most likely resulting in a hung bus (worst case) or data
corruption (best case).
