What's the point?
If the system is secure, then adding sanity checking to the ATA code
makes no difference: nobody gets to do anything improper anyway.
If the system is not secure, then adding sanity checking to the ATA code
makes no difference: people who could use the ATA thing can use other
things that are much more insidious. 
The mechanism that everybody wants is _already_ there.  It's called
"permissions".  No new driver code necessary. 
If those permissions do not work, then they don't work, and adding
last-minute band-aids makes no difference.
Just as a comparison, look at Windows. It takes the opposite approach:
it has no real seurity, but a LOT of band-aids to avoid the "obvious"
holes. Leaving it wide open.
