Can you do a "diff" between the dmesg output of a working kernel, and a 
nonworking one? Also, please do the same with /proc/interrupts...
It sounds like your ethernet card is on irq11 (sharing it with USB), but 
that something has incorrectly decided that it must be somewhere else and 
then when the ethernet irq happens, it continually screams on irq11 until 
the kernel decides that it has to shut it up. At which point both ethernet 
and USB is dead (the former because it is on the wrong interrupt, the 
latter because the kernel had to shut up the irq that it was sharing in 
order to avoid endless irqs).
