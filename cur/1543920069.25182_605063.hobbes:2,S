Right you are. remap_vmalloc_range doesn't turn the passed vmalloc
area into user memory (it creates a completely new mapping).
Presumably it either wants to copy_to_user to that new mapping, or
memcpy to ->vmalloc? Would the former be an attempt to avoid some
virtual aliasing issues?

I don't know why one would be finding remap_vmalloc_range to fail
it mmap time but not later? Should just do it at mmap time and if
that is failing, then work out why (or ask linux-mm for help).
Actually there is probably a window where we can get subsequent
anonymous pages faulted into the empty vma there if we haven't
remapped it, then the subsequent attempt to remap will hit the
BUG_ON in remap_pte_range.
(that's aside from the big conceptual problem with passing in an
"invented" vma... don't do that! (: )
