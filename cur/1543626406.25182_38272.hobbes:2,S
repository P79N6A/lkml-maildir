I just tested it and oldconfig at least works.  The overhead is exactly
one byte.

I currently allow a compiled in command line to be appended to.  lilo also
does this when you specify a command line, and to my knowledge all boot options
prefer the last value specified so that should be good enough.  As the decision
happens in C code it isn't to hard to change either way.
