No. We're not rolling back anything, it's totally unrealistic. These
are device drivers we're talking about here, not a database. The I/O
accesses done by the hardware monitoring drivers are not that long, so
AML gets to wait for them to be finished, and that's it. There is no
valid reason to give the priority to AML over regular device drivers.
Rudolf Marek's approach sounds much better.

Most notebooks don't expose their hardware monitoring chip at all.
Those which do use SMBus devices in majority, where I/O forwarding is
going to be difficult, as it needs to be done at the SMBus controller
level, not the hardware monitoring device level. I want to get my hands
on such a laptop first though, as I need to see what exacly ACPI is
doing before I can think of a solution.
