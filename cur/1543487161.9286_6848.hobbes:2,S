Hi,
I have a Windows 95 box that connects to a PPP server that is running
Linux 2.2.2. The protocols above PPP are TCP/IP and IPX.
After I connect, if I try to brose the network neverhood, the modem
goes into an endless loop sending a receiving data. I ran tcpdump to
capture packets going through the PPP interface and found something
really weird:
00:50:38.467533 8.73.80.157 > 5.80.130.151: (frag 4:94@5304) [tos 0xff]
00:50:38.468145 110.2.5.120 > 5.82.130.151: (frag 260:5@5304) [tos 0xff]
00:50:38.607511 8.73.80.157 > 5.80.130.151: (frag 4:94@5304) [tos 0xff]
00:50:38.608101 110.2.5.120 > 5.82.130.151: (frag 260:5@5304) [tos 0xff]
00:50:38.897507 8.73.80.157 > 5.80.130.151: (frag 4:94@5304) [tos 0xff]
00:50:38.898111 110.2.5.120 > 5.82.130.151: (frag 260:5@5304) [tos 0xff]
00:50:39.407456 8.73.80.157 > 5.80.130.151: (frag 4:1100@5304) [tos 0xff]
and this repeats over and over.
I don't recognize the source address, but the destination address is
incorrect, it should be 130.151.x.x.
My system is running Debian 2.1 aka Slink.
Let me know if someone wants more information.
