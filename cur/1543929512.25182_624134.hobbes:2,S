It has occurred to me that I am seeing an implication here that may in fact not
exist.
My impression of dev_get_by_xxxx is that the function is only able to be used
sanely when being part of the definition of a kernel/userspace interface.  With
the further assumption on my part that you need to define a new instance of
dev_get_by_xxxx 
It has just occurred to me that it is possible to reuse the SIOCBRADDIF
and SIOCBRDELIF for that same purpose without defining a new kernel/userspace
interface.
What and how are you using dev_get_by_xxx?
