	I was running 2 copies of setiathome on a 4 CPU server
@ work.  The two processes ran nice'd -19.  The builds we were 
running still took 20-30% longer as opposed to when setiathome wasn't
running (went from 45 minutes up to about an hour).  This machine
has 1G, so I don't think it was hurting from swapping.
I finally wrote a script that checked every 30 seconds -- if the
load on the machine climbed over '4', the script would SIGSTOP the
seti jobs.  Once the load on the machine fell below 2, it would 
send a SIGCONT to them.  
I was also running setiathome on my laptop for a short while --
but the fan kept coming on and the computer would get really hot.
So I stopped that.  Linux @ idle doesn't seem to ever kick on
the fan, but turn on a CPU cruching program and it sure seemed
to heat up the machine.  I still wonder how many kilo or mega watts
go to running dispersed computation programs.  Just one of those
things I may never know....
