Interesting.  I hadn't known that.  It didn't actually fail with
the ALI bridge, I just assumed it was a mistake.  Can anyone with
docs on non-DEC bridges confirm that this is a common thing?
Certainly the fact should be commented if the old code goes back
in to avoid disruption by helpful folks like myself.  :-)
