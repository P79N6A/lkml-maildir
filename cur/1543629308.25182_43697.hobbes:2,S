That's just overhead. you don't need an additional table
ordinal/logical things.
the only case nonlinear will pay off is when you have to deal with a
single pgdat with physical huge holes in the middle of its per-node
mem_map. You don't have those holes in the middle of the mem_map of each
node, so it's cleaner and faster to avoid nonlinear for you, it's just
overhead.
nonlinear instead definitely pays off with the origin 2k layout shown by
Ralf, or with the iseries machine if the partitioning mandates an huge
number of discontigous chunks.
