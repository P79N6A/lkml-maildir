Hi Jeff,

I like it. It's fairly simple. I'm always amazed how many people do really
believe that these cards provide hardware RAID !!! The problem is when you
ask a reseller to add a real hardware RAID card in a system you purchase
and you end up with a cheap silicon image... It happened to us once and it's
not funny at all.
Cheers,
Willy
