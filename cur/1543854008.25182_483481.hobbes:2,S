I notice that none of the fields in these structs seem to be 
endianness-annotated, but that there's a lot of cpu_to_be64 and so on 
being used to frob values into them.  Please make sure that the driver 
passes a sparse check, which it looks like it almost certainly cannot 
right now.

Should probably be an inline function instead of a macro.
