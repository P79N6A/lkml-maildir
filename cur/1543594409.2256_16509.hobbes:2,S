Well, it's part of the SuSE distribution at least, and it tests hard 
disk performance - you need to give it a test size greater than your 
system's memory or all you're testing is Linux's ability to buffer reads 
and writes. :-) So for my 512Mb system I use "bonnie -s 1024"

/dev/hde:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  3 (32-bit w/sync)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 79780/16/63, sectors = 80418240, start = 0
I have 32-bit IO (with sync) and multiple sector transfers enabled, 
where you don't. I don't expect that's the cause of the problem though - 
For instance, I can run reliably with any kernel with those enabled, as 
long as DMA is disabled.
