Steve tested a patch with arch-independent zone-sizing backed out for 
x86_64 and things looked ok but that is no guarantee it is not a 
contributary factor. The "Nosave address range:" printks are related to a 
suspend problem that was reported .... end of June I believe.
I'll pick this up in the morning because I should have access to the same 
machine Steve does and see what I can come up with.

hmm, rather than bugging you with patches now, I'll see what I can find 
with the x86_64 machines I have access to and see can I reproduce it.
