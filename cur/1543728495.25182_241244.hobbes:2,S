I get it now.  BTW, if dump can determine when the end of the media is 
reached it will close / reopen automatically, so it might also be 
possible to drop the -B option and make full use of media of different 
sizes (you can backup more data to an 80 minute CDR, less to a "business 
card" format one).  You couldn't do that with "playing double-buffering 
games using -F to switch around".
