A lot more often than you'd think.

Linus vetoed that option years ago.  Anyway, the standalone version of
klibc has been available for almost three years, and has been used by
at least Debian for their initramfs code for a considerable amount of
time.  It's not like it's an untested piece of code.

Judgement call.  I'm not sure I have done the best possible job,
either, but you have to call it somewhere.

Hyperbole.
FWIW, I've worked in environments where you pull a single source tree
and get the compilers as well as the code you build them with.  It is
*wonderful* for reproducibility, but I don't think that's going to
happen with respect to Linux, and noone is calling for that.

You don't need mdadm to boot from RAID.  kinit handles it just fine.
At the same time, I do intend to continue to maintain the standalone
klibc, which can be used to produce external binary trees.

When I asked Andrew how he'd like me to pass him the code, he said he
was happy pulling my git tree.  This saved time for both of us, and
made it easier and quicker for me to integrate fixes.  You can do so
too, which will get you a full history of the development, in about
1,400 pieces.
