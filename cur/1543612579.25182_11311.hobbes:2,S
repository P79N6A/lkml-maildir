IIRC, few years ago someone posted a link on axp-list, and I picked it up.
Anyway, I've placed it on
ftp://ftp.park.msu.ru/ink/docs/21174_SI.pdf

Put the chip into PCI loopback mode, read some memory (crossing the
page boundary) via direct PCI window and check for corruption -
perhaps this will work.

Checking the revision won't help - that bug should be fixed with some
off-chip logic.

#ifdef CONFIG_ALPHA_PYXIS won't work for them.

Maybe...
Jay, your opinion? Perhaps you have the info which systems are affected?
