Subject: question about possibility of data loss in Ext2/3 file system

As far as I know, in Ext2/3 file system, data blocks to be flushed to
disk are usually marked as dirty and wait for kernel thread to flush
them lazily. So data blocks of a file could be flushed even after this
file is closed.
Now consider this scenario: suppose data block 2,3 and 4 of file A are
marked to be flushed out. At time T1, block 2 and 3 are flushed, and
file A is closed. However, at time T2, system experiences power outage
and failed to flushed block 4. Does that mean we will end up with
getting a partially flushed file?  Is there any way to provide better
guarantee on file integrity?
