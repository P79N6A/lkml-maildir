The test11 patch has the ne2k-pci changes for FD support, and the
test12 patch has the Tx timeout relocation in 8390 (which ne2k-pci
uses).  Can you see which one of those (if either) causes the
breakage?  You should be able to put the 8390.c and ne2k-pci.c
from test10 directly into 2.4.0 proper (one at a time and then
both if required) to see which (if either) is responsible.
Thanks,
Paul.
