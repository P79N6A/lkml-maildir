No, I havent tried the aa patches. I belive the aa patches are to be 
integrated in the 2.4.18 official stable release.
Since I am quite happy with the performance of my machine with 
the rmap patch......I will leave it as it is. Though, for your information 
I will be checking out the aa patches on my backup machine 
which is also of the same class. I will let you guys know the 
performance with the aa patches incorporated as soon as
I set it up on the other machine.

Anish
