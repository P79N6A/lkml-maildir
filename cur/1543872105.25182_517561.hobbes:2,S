[ Eric, Ingo, can you double-check the timer initialization after resume? 
  We appear to have several reports of date not advancing, and while this 
  could be some SATA issue, it could easily be a timer tick issue too ]

Ok. I think we mostly solved the irq-related stuff, but you might want to 
check whether you have CONFIG_NOHZ on or off and whether that makes a 
difference.

Yeah, there is some problem with SATA resume. It would be beautiful if the 
people who actually see this could narrow it down with bisection. "It 
works for me" is clearly the case for many people, but not all.
But before blaming SATA, check if you have NO_HZ enabled and whether 
disabling that makes it work ok. If timeouts don't work right (or are 
*extremely* slow) things that should be instant won't be.

I think this is likely just more of the disk being buggered, but it could 
again be related to NO_HZ (people report time not advancing, and that 
would make any X timeout taking forever, and you'd see exactly your 
behaviour).
