I origanaly started this "EXT3 scaling to large numbers of drives" thread on both the LSE and the LKM lists. 
I forgot to CC the LKML when I posted this yesterday.  The LSE is likely the better place for this type of thing so take this as 
just an FYI to close out some of the open quiestions that where made durring that thread.

I've just finished getting some EXT2 block throughput data as requested by
this list for the  "Ext3 performance bottleneck as the number of spindles
gets large" email thread that I started last week.
Recall the system is a dual PCI/66 box with 4 good SCSI cards with up to 6
15KRPM ST318452LC drives per card.  (dual 1.2Ghz Pentium 3 with 2 Gig RAM
running kernels high mem support == OFF )

The benchmark we are using is bonnie++ version 1.02h
ttp://www.coker.com.au/bonnie++
Running on 2.4.18 base, 8KB writes to 300MB files I get the following data
when run on the ext 2 file system.
2 adapters (on separate PCI buses)
Drives per card	 Total system throughput EXT2          EXT3
          1                      73357 KB/sec                   92095 KB/sec

          1                     125282 KB/sec                   121125 KB/sec

          3                     146622 KB/sec
          4                     142472 KB/sec
          5                     142560 KB/sec

This performance still isn't very competitive and we see very little evidence
of scaling.
I think that there we should be getting closer to 300,000KB/sec for max
throughput.  I'll get some lock meter data tomorrow, as well as run with some
of those patches I've been sent and perhaps even some other kernels ( any
recomendations?).
>From this data I conclude that the BKL that ext3 is abusing using is only
part of the problem.
Comments? Ideas? Recommendations?
Attached is the script I'm using to do the 4 addapter runs.  Its not pritty,
but if you have questions regarding the tests it may help clarify things.
