I have a question.  What about disks that aren't in the bios?  I have
machines setup with only 1 disk in bios (if ide) and the rest (if any) are
not.
I also have one machine that is diskless and I used it to transfer data on a
ide hard drive.  Usually I'll just plug the drives in w/o powering off (lets
not get into the it's not safe.  I could care less about the machine or the
drive.  They're both old and replacable!).  Obviously, these drives are not
in the bios.  Linux does a good job of finding these drives (the ide
subsystem is compiled as modules).
