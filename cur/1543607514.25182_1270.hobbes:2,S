No, just out of sleep.
Sorry, folks
printk() does not deadlock.
I just put a funny little typo at the wrong place in my code
which resulted in a very fast eternal loop. So the system
froze and lloked like deadlocked. The CPU was nearly always in 
printk().
Thanks andrew for opening my eyes and sorry again for the 
inconveniance.
