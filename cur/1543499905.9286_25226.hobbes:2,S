No.  Check the Single Unix glossary:
 synchronised I/O data integrity completion
      For read, when the operation has been completed or diagnosed
      if unsuccessful. The read is complete only when an image of
      the data has been successfully transferred to the requesting
      process. If there were any pending write requests affecting
      the data to be read at the time that the synchronised read
      operation was requested, these write requests shall be
      successfully transferred prior to reading the data.
      For write, when the operation has been completed or
      diagnosed if unsuccessful. The write is complete only when
      the data specified in the write request is successfully
      transferred and all file system information required to
      retrieve the data is successfully transferred.
      File attributes that are not necessary for data retrieval (access
      time, modification time, status change time) need not be
      successfully transferred prior to returning to the calling
      process.
 synchronised I/O file integrity completion
      Identical to a synchronised I/O data integrity completion with the
      addition that all file attributes relative to the I/O operation
      (including access time, modification time, status change time)
      will be successfully transferred prior to returning to the calling
      process.
O_DSYNC and fdatasync() can skip some of the inode updates, but when
extending the file or allocating data we need to sync the inode and the
indirect blocks too.
