Only one thread must do that, otherwise you couldn't distinguish between
"multiple writers are waiting, the lock is free" and "one writer is
waiting, one reader owns the lock".

I think there is a problem: neither "write_lock_trylock()" nor
"read_lock_trylock()" [ie the inline part of your rw-semaphore
operations] are atomic, both change a value, and if a certain flag is
set, then they undo their change.
I think there is a race with 2 CPUs [1*write,1*read] where noone owns
the semaphore, but both fail to acquire the semaphore:
CPU1: down_write()	CPU2: down_read()
CPU1:			CPU2:
lock bts RWL
			lock inc RWL
test RWL ,0x7ff
jne contention_wr[taken]	
			js [taken]
			<hardware interrupt>
contention_wr:
spinlock RWL_LOCK
if <we are the first sleeper>
	inc RWL <executed>
if RWL == 0x8000 0001 <ie lock is free>
	goto got_semaphore; <not taken, value is 0x8000 0002>
spin_unlock RWL_LOCK
schedule()
			lock dec RWL;
			spinlock RWL_LOCK
			if <we are the first sleeper>
				inc RWL <not executed>			
			
			if RWL >0 <no writer>
				goto got_semaphore <not taken>
			spin_unlock RWL_LOCK
			schedule()
--> both threads called schedule(), and noone is going to wake them up.
A dirty hack would be that contention_wr stores the information
"highest bit set because a writer is waiting, the semaphore is not
acquired by a writer" in "struct rw_semaphore.ugly_hack", and
__down_shared_failed() always succeeds if ugly_hack is set.
But now we would starve writers.
