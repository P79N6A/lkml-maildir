It's in -mm already and it was said the big grudges are fixed.
What do you still want?

Huh? You mean -mm? That's what people do, backport to mainline.
Or did I miss something?

Oh no! NOOOOOOOO! New features come at a cost?!
Shit, I better unpack my C64.

These are things people will start using when available.
They're given a framework which enables them to do things other
people can't imagine.
Too bad you're convinced everything everyone does is on the level of "Urgh"

But the competitor's filesystems are evolving past that 30-year-old
paradigm, why shouldn't Linux's?
And if Reiser4 is merged and its VFS-doubling things merged into the VFS,
how much will it bloat Ext2 if Ext2 doesn't go near files-as-dirs
or extended stat data?

Arguments left and right for and against this.
I'd rather see someone write the code that does this, or, even better,
you can write the code that proves this definitively wrong and someone
else will get it to work.
(Ok, I hate the "DIY" counter-argument as much as the next man, but
this seemed almost an appropriate place to use it)

"You've got data objects"
All we need is the extra bit that's MAY_LOOKUP so we don't need +x
to access metadata. But apparently this is too much to ask for.
Why? /Probably/ standards compliance. 
So why be compliant, if it's backwards compatible? SILENCE!
No really, why not extend something without breaking? ...we don't wanna...

Sure, extinguish innovation. Got it.
