Is this kernel policy? I mean, you could apply the same argument to
all device nodes ;-)

Event is a bit generic, and sys_event is vague. I agree that boxevent
is not a pretty name, but it gives a vague suggestion of
hardwareness. hwevent looks ugly - what do people think?

The suggested action is given as the first word. The second word is
the subsystem, in order to avoid namespace collisions: you could have
two different PM systems active on your machine at different times,
(e.g. ACPI and APM) and this lets you distinguish between them. You
could think of it as the first word being the suggested action and the
rest being a description.

ACPI_STATUS bm_osl_generate_event (
       BM_HANDLE               device_handle,
       char                    *device_type,
       char                    *device_instance,
       u32                     event_type,
       u32                     event_data)
{
The function could quickly be converted to boxevent without thinking
sprintf(buffer,"device %s instance %s says %x: %x",
        device_type,device_instance,event_type,event_data);
boxevent(BOXEVENT_NOTIFY,"ACPI",buffer);
this would provide all of the current functionality available from
ACPI (ATM the code does sprintf(str, "%s %s %08x %08x\n") to the
userspace reader) but boxevent also handles poll, short reads, and
event floods, etc.
Some one who knows about ACPI could change the BOXEVENT_NOTIFY to a
better suggestion based on event_type or something.
