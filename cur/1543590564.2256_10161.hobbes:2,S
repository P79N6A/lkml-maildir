That's pretty much what I would have said a couple of hours ago 
before grepping the kernel. Try it, though. ENOTTY is rarely used. 
ENOIOCTLCMD is all over the damned place, though its comment in 
errno.h warns that a user shouldn't see it. And if you browse a bunch 
of random ioctl handlers, you'll see EINVAL used for a bad command 
much more often than ENOTTY.
FWIW, the comment in errno.h under Solaris 2.6 is "Inappropriate 
ioctl for device". I believe that's the POSIX interpretation.
