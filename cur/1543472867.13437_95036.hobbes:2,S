Hi, 
	I am figuring out the behaviour of buffer cache and have been facing a 
strange problems. 
 I am creating a test directory and copying some ascii files to that directory 
after which 
I do a sync and then execute the command 
"cat /mnt/*" in a loop where /mnt is the mount point for that device. 
In the middle of this operation, I shutdown my machine. The next time I reboot 
the machine, 
the device is corrupted and after doing e2fsck on that, half the files are 
corrupted. My 
doubt is cat should open all the files in read only mode; then why is the file 
system getting 
modified. My understanding is fs will be put in an inconsistent state only if 
there are dirty 
buffers/inodes not yet flushed and the shutdown occurs. Here I am making sure 
that all my 
buffers are flushed back( I go thru the OS's buffer cache and print out all 
the dirty buffers 
for the device; there are none) and I am opening the files in read only mode. 
How does the 
file system reach an inconsistent state? 
 
Thanks and Regards 
Raghav
