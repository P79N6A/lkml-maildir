Is this being compiled on a non-ppc/powerpc platform?  That might explain it.  UCC_GETH is 
defined in drivers/net/Kconfig, but UCC_FAST is defined in 
arch/powerpc/sysdev/qe_lib/Kconfig.  So I supposed if you don't compile for ARCH=powerpc, 
then arch/powerpc/sysdev/qe_lib/Kconfig is never loaded?
If that's the case, then we're always going to have this problem with platform-dependent 
drivers in the /drivers/ directory.  The ucc_geth driver depends on the "QE library", 
which is present only on some PowerPC processors, so we put the config options for the QE 
in arch/powerpc.  But since ucc_geth is a standard Ethernet driver, it exists in drivers/net.
