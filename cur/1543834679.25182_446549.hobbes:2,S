Well, you do actually know when they want to look at it.  The rtc driver only
unmasks its interrupt when a user space process has opened the device and sent
it a RTC_UIE ON or RTC_PIE_ON (or other shuch ioctl).  So if you open /dev/rtc,
and memory map the page, but never enable a timer method, then every read of the
page returns zero.  The only overhead this patch is currently adding, execution
time-wise is the extra time it takes to write to a the shared page variable.  If
the timer tick interrupt is executing, its because someone is reading tick data,
or plans to very soon.
