This patch causes the following warnings:
/opt/crosstool/gcc-4.1.0-glibc-2.3.6/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/i686-unknown-linux-gnu-ld: .tmp_vmlinux1: warning: allocated section `.smp_altinstr_replacement' not in segment
/opt/crosstool/gcc-4.1.0-glibc-2.3.6/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/i686-unknown-linux-gnu-ld: .tmp_vmlinux2: warning: allocated section `.smp_altinstr_replacement' not in segment
/opt/crosstool/gcc-4.1.0-glibc-2.3.6/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/i686-unknown-linux-gnu-ld: vmlinux: warning: allocated section `.smp_altinstr_replacement' not in segment
The patch
i386-force-section-size-to-be-non-zero-to-prevent-a-symbol-becoming-absolute.patch
makes those warnings go away again, but we decided to drop that.
This:
  .smp_altinstr_replacement : AT(ADDR(.smp_altinstr_replacement) - LOAD_OFFSET) {
	*(.smp_altinstr_replacement)
	. = ALIGN(4096);
	__smp_alt_end = .;
  }
looks odd.  What's the point in putting a gap before __smp_alt_end?  Moving
__smp_alt_end to before the ALIGN doesn't prevent the warning.
