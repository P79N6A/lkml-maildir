If you want to stop people accessing *inodes*, the appropriate permissions
should be set for the inode. Permissions on directories AFAIK only control
access to the contents of the directory - which are just (name, inum) pairs.
The fact that there's no standardised API for open-by-inode isn't necessarily
a feature. And anyway, even if Jamie's feature got integrated, I'm sure it
would be off by default.
