Well, the easiest way to convince nVidia is to own someone else's
product, that does support Linux ;-)
Right now -- for the bleeding edge 3D hardware -- hardware makers
are across-the-board closed source AFAIK.  ATI used to be open source,
but their new "microcode JIT" stuff for the latest h/w isn't
Until a volume 3D h/w maker goes open source and gives Linux users a
market to buy into, it's pretty much closed source moving forward :(
