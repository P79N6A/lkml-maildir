You use non-blocking mode here.

A select with no timeout, so it will immediately return.

This might be what Solaris does differently, by _not_ including '1' in
the returned descriptors? Linux will say (rightly) that a following call
will not block, which is something very different than 'will not fail'!

You don't check the exit status here, but when you press Ctrl-C (stdout
blocked) it will indicate an error here (exit status -1) with errno set
to EAGAIN, meaning you should try again, which is the appropriate result
for a non-blocking descriptor or socket here. Anyway, the call "succeeds" and
we loop back into the while(1), indeed as you say creating a busy loop.
No surprises there I'd say.

You might start by checking for EAGAIN as result of the write, and then
reacting according to your needs (waiting a while or exiting the
program or whatever).
