>From a hal point of view, we don't care if the device name is 'led01' or
'light_to_dance_the_fandango' and from a shell point of view it's
probably best for the latter. I think the point Greg tried to make is
that it shouldn't matter, and HAL shouldn't export (nor parse) the
device name as anything sensible.

If it's a trivial name then I think led_thinklight0 is perfectly okay, I
think Kay was talking more about the attribute vs. name-in-device
encoding.
