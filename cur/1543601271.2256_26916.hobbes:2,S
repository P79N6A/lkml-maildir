Hi,
I'm trying to setup a 2.2 kernel that I can use for comparison to the latest
2.4 kernels I've been testing, but I came accross a little problem with the
patches I've been trying to combine.
I've already applied:
ide.2.2.19.05042001.patch
linux-2.2.19.kdb.diff
linux-2.2.19.ext3.diff
And now I'm trying to apply raid-2.2.19-A1, and I get one reject in
include/linux/fs.h.

  #define BH_Req		3	/* 0 if the buffer has been invalidated */
  #define BH_Protected	6	/* 1 if the buffer is protected */
  #define BH_Wait_IO	7	/* 1 if we should throttle on this buffer */
+ #define BH_LowPrio	8	/* 1 if the buffer is lowprio */
  
  /*
   * Try to keep the most commonly used fields in single cache lines (16
Now I have two defines from different patches for the same bit.  The top
line is from RAID, and bottom is of ext3 origin.
#define BH_LowPrio	8	/* 1 if the buffer is lowprio */
#define BH_Temp         8       /* 1 if the buffer is temporary (unlinked)
Is this a fatal conflict?  How can I resolve this?
Mike
