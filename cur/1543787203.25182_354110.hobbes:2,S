Ah, but you're talking of SKAS0.
In this case (which seems strange, given the number of people using x86_64 and 
not complaining - or maybe it's just me who didn't say "enable frame 
pointers" to any of the various bug reports), if the patch is not trivial 
enough (it seems to be), make sure to at least force frame pointers.
Even if I think, if I understood the thing correctly, that this workaround is 
not even guaranteed to work.

By restoring in sp the address of first param (or something like that), right?

The bug killing almost everybody testing 2.6.12-bb? In this case, it's SKAS0 
specific.
But especially, couldn't this be triggered by another GCC version, changing 
the stack layout?
