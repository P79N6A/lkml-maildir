Yep.. If you haven't already, just change the permissions on 
/dev/dri/card0 to give access to your user id and it should be fine. 
(Reporter of this bug had to do the same in order to get it working)
Something in the kernel changes as far as DRI goes - Dont know what. And 
I know why I wasn't affected - NVIDIA driver which doesnt use 
/dev/dri/*. Though Trever seems to be having an entirely different 
problem - one oddity being the continuos -EINTRs that his OO.o gets on 
startup.
Trever - If your problem isn't solved yet - Can you run gdb 
/path/to/ooffice from commandline and then when it segfaults, post the 
backtrace?
