DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is not the only user of change_page_attr: gart also 
removes it's pages from the linear mapping.
I think x86info should accept the -EFAULT as an indication that the 
targeted page is in use for other purpose, and definitively doesn't 
contain a mptable. The other option would be to change both 
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and the AGP gart driver

It breaks either your app or your AGP driver - what's simpler to fix? 
I'm biased, because if you update the AGP driver, then I must figure out 
how to fix DEBUG_PAGEALLOC 8-)
