I am using an IBM-DTLA-307030 with HPT366 for almost 2 years with
many kernels in 2.4 and 2.5 series without problems after limiting
transfer rate to udma3 (44MB/s) in the HPT bios. You can also do it with
hdparm if your boot disk is not on that controler. Trying udma4 resulted
in _massive_ corruption (never tried recently). Of course, I enabled
HPT366 support in kernel configuration. Hdparm gives 35 MM/sec.
This is on an Abit BP6. Hope it helps.
