So set the default buffer size to 8k if UDP is being used. Other than 
getting people to believe 2.6 is broken, you buy nothing. People running 
UDP are probably not cutting edge state of the art, let the default be 
small and the client negotiate up if desired.
Why do so many Linux people have the idea that because a standard says 
they CAN do something, it's fine to do it in a way which doesn't conform 
to common practice. And Linux 2.4 practice should count even if you 
pretend that Solaris, AIX, Windows and BSD don't count...
