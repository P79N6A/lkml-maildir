Holes are not the issue.
clear_page_tables() doesn't even use the VMA list as a guide
(it actually can't), it just walks the page tables one pgd at a
time, one pmd at a time, one pte at a time.  And this has the
worst cache behavior even for simple cases like lat_proc
in lmbench.
Each pgd/pmd scan is a data reading walk of a whole page
(or whatever size the particular page table level blocks
are for the platform, usually they are PAGE_SIZE).
It's very costly.
