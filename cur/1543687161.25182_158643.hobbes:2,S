Or used directly by uclibc (and linux from scratch) to build the library 
against.

Okay, I'd like to ask about the headers thing:
I've got a project using uclibc, and build it myself, currently against the 
2.4 headers.  What's the plan for 2.6?  Everything I've seen on the subject 
is "using kernel headers directly from userspace is evil, even to build your 
libc against, but we currently offer no alternative, so go bug your libc 
maintainer and have THEM do it..."
I'm hoping I've missed something in the months I was off the list this spring, 
but haven't quite figured out what to search for in the archives yet...
