www.deja.com carries it...
I run the fa.* gateways (it's not as well maintained as I'd like, but
fa.linux.kernel works fine :-) All these are one-way, since that is
the easy way of avoiding spews, spam and clueless posters.  We feed
this hierarchy onto the Usenet backbone, so it ends up on Deja.
But this is weird.  The message from Tom Crane says:

So someone has set up a return route to linux-kernel?  Although fa.*
is a name with roots (it stands for From Arpanet, and was the
hierarchy for gated mailings lists before The Great Renaming; we just
recycled the name back in the late 80's), I find it a bit unlikely
that the people in London should come up with the exact same name for
the newsgroup as us.  I don't quite understand what's going on.

Oops, that rules out www.deja.com, I guess.  Using newzbot, I found a
server in Greece, but it seems slooow.  I won't open my server for
reading, but I can offer your news admin a feed of fa.linux.* if he
wants it.
