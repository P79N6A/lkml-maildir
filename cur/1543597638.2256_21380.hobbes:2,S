It looks like 2.4.9-pre1 breaks the NFS server.  Directories still get
exported and clients can mount them fine, but the ls command on the
client fails to report any files.  Filename completion also doesn't
work.  However, files can still be viewed if you know the exact file
name.
The same problem happens with 2.4.9-pre2.
