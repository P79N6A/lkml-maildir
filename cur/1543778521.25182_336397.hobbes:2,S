Parts of this should conflict with a patch in -mm from a few weeks ago.
then I check and don't see it there.... hrm, wonder what happened to it.
-Separate each logical change into its own patch.
+Separate each _logical changes_ into its own patch.
                        change
or drop "each" and change "its own patch"
to "a single patch file."
 On the other hand, if you make a single change to numerous files,
-group those changes into a single patch.  Thus a single logical change
-is contained within a single patch.
+group those changes into a single patch.  Thus single logical changes
+are contained within a single patch.
It's better in the original form.
+Do not send more than 15 patches at once to the vger mailing lists!!!
Only in one place, please.
