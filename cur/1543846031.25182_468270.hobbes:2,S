I double checked this now. This case Eric ran into should be already
fixed by a patch from Jan that went in before 2.6.18 even.
He just ran with an old kernel (2.6.18-rc3) that didn't have
that particular fix.
Still the kernel stack termination is probably a good idea. I think
(haven't tested) the current 2.6.18-git* code with termination 
wouldn't have crashed, but reported a (incorrect) stuck.
