The file clearly had a lot of codingstyle problems, but so does your
patch, sadly.

IMHO you should specify identifiers for the arg-list of a function
prototype even though they aren't technically required. The kernel
favours that style overwhelmingly for good reason -- helps identify
_what_ that argument is with just one look at the prototype.

Whitespace should go ... ditto in zillion other places in this file.
Also, you could combine the above two lines into a single line -- that's
the general style followed by most of the kernel, and I've noticed tools
such as cscope / ctags getting confused otherwise (though this is really
a bug in those tools). That'll further reduce LOC, allowing more code to
be displayed per-screenful, which is always good.
