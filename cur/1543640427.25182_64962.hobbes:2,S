You lost me. The kernel of course has "client" access to the internal
pool. And since the userspace reads from /dev/random, it benefits
from HRNG just the same way it does now. Point 2 is somewhat obscure
to me. The kernel has only one observer to deal with, in theory.
One that gains *all* the knowlegde about the internal pool the
kernel leaks, mainly by returning random bits to those who ask. Assuming
the observer has less than 100% knowledge of that is just overstimating
the entropy (== understimating the ability of the observer to guess
the internal state). And from the application standpoint, it could just
discard part of the values it gets from the PRNG, to emulate concurrent
access, but what for? The result is as good as the untouched PRNG
sequence...
