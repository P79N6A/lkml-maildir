On my arch it results in huge bloated code, including mul and div insns!
Here's what gcc 3.3.x does for both the prefix macro versions:
   #define _calc_vm_trans_2(x,bit1,bit2) \
    ((bit1) <= (bit2) ? ((x) & (bit1)) * ((bit2) / (bit1)) \
       : ((x) & (bit1)) / ((bit1) / (bit2)))
   int test2_0 (unsigned val)
   {
     return _calc_vm_trans_2 (val,0x20,0x80);
   }
==>
   _test2_0:
           andi 32,r6,r10	#, val, tmp43
           shl 2,r10	#, <result>
           jmp [r31]
Here's what gcc 3.3.x does for your inlined function version:
   static inline void assert_single_bit(unsigned long bit)
   {
           extern __bug() __attribute__ ((noreturn));
           if (bit & (bit - 1))
             __bug ();
   }
   static inline unsigned long 
   _calc_vm_trans_3(unsigned long x, unsigned long bit1, unsigned long bit2) 
   {
           assert_single_bit(bit1); 
           assert_single_bit(bit2); 
           return ((bit1) <= (bit2) ? ((x) & (bit1)) * ((bit2) / (bit1))
                   : ((x) & (bit1)) / ((bit1) / (bit2))); 
   }
   int test3_0 (unsigned val)
   {
     return _calc_vm_trans_3 (val,0x20,0x80);
   }
==>
   _test3_0:
           movea lo(32),r0,r7	#, bit1
           movea lo(128),r0,r5	#, bit2
           divu r7,r5,r10	# bit1, bit2, tmp55
           mov r6,r10	# val, tmp52
           and r7,r10	# bit1, tmp52
           mul r5,r10,r0	# bit2, tmp52
           jmp [r31]
[I've no idea what's up with that, I don't even think the generated code
makes sense, but it seems like the presence of inline function is
confusing something.]
