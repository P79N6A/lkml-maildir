I didn't say "use it everywhere" ;)
Just in places like this:
	if (percpu_counter_read(something) > something_else)
		make_an_application_fail();
in that case it's worth running percpu_counter_sum().  And bear in mind
that once we've done that, the following percpu_counter_read()s become
accurate, so we won't run the expensive percpu_counter_sum() again
for a while.  Unless we're really close to or over the limit, in which case
blowing a few cycles is relatively unimportant.
All that should be captured in library code (per_cpu_counter_exceeds(ptr,
threshold), for example) rather than open-coded everywhere.

You mean a 16 CPU box with NR_CPUS=16 as well...

Sure, we need to make that happen.  But it got all mixed up with the
spinlock removal and it does need quite some thought and testing and
documentation to help developers to choose the right settings and
appropriate selection of defaults, etc.
