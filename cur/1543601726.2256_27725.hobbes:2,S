Thinking about this some more, it would seem that the
"perfect fork()" would be one where you DON'T copy the
page tables, but only set the parent's page tables to
read-only and point the VMAs of the child at some kind
of memory objects.
For example, for file-backed VMAs we might already skip
the page table copying right now.

Rik
