 Yes, but there's the kernel who writes to the clock,
 for example 
http://lxr.linux.no/source/arch/arm/kernel/time.c?a=arm#L103

 Ok. We can use dynamic device numbers and go for the /dev

 agreed. there are are also some variables of interest in
 
http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/timex.h?a=arm#L188
 some of them may be usefully exported in sysfs.
