If you want to come anything close to comparable with a Netapp, get a
few hundred Megabytes of NVRAM (e.g. www.umem.com), and configure it
as an external journal for your filesystem (I know this can be done
for ext3, I don't know about other filesystems).  Then make sure your
filesystem journals all data, not just metadata (data=journal option
to ext3).
If you use a dedicated drive (or mirrored pair) in place of the NVRAM,
you will come reasonably close.
