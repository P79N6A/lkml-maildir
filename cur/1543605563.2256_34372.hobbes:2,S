I'm not arguing against MODULE_LICENSE. I'm arguing against
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL. I fully agree with the person who mentioned that
calling certain interfaces "restricted" and basing that restriction on
the licence of the interface user is an abuse of copyright.
More reasonable would be to have header files that looked like this:
#ifndef GPL_COMPATIBLE_LICENSE
#error This header file is restricted to GPL-compatible code only.
#endif
