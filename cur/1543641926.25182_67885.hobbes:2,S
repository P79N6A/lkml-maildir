Again, Why?
You can always use the flat device as-is.

But moving it to user space would cause the kernel to crash anyway. Bugs 
are bugs.

The same guesses and heuristics would have to be in user space.

It's not policy. It's a fact of life that disks need to be split up into 
parts, and the partitioning schemes are well-defined and shared across 
multiple operating systems.

But I actually _agree_ with this. 
However, that has nothing to do with whether it is in user space or kernel 
space. In many ways it is _easier_ to do on demand in kernel space: when 
somebody opens /dev/sda1 and it isn't partitioned yet, you know it needs 
to be. 
The fact that partitioning right now is to some degree handled by device
drivers is a problem, but that's not a user space vs kernel space issue.
It's slowly getting moved to higher levels.
