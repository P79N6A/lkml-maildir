Well, a couple of RFC's have already been sent with this regard.
Most of these recent freezer changes resulted due to the discussions
that took place over  these RFC's.
This was the first attempt
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/14/106
and a more recent one
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/2/33

Soon actually does mean soon :-) 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/27/616
 was sent out recently. 
I am working on the Rafael's suggestions. 
The only thing holding these patches back is the fact that 
quite an amount of patches on the freezer/kthread front has gone in 
recently, which need more review and testing. 
Will keep you posted on the freezer developments from now on.
