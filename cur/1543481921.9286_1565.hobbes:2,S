Brian,
the appropriate way to do is:
go to 
ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/suse/ftp.suse.com/isdn4linux/v2.1/
get
isdn -> isdn-9901201200.tar.gz
get
isdn4k-utils -> isdn4k-utils-9901211200.tar.gz
unpack it in /usr/src
mkdir /usr/src/linux/drivers/isdn/diehl
mkdir /usr/src/linux/drivers/isdn/eicon
in /usr/src/isdn: ./std2kern -d
then make config in /usr/src/linux und bake the kernel as usual
in /usr/src/isdn4k-utils:
make config && make && make install
don't forget to set the dialmode in your init script:
e.g.
      isdnctrl dialmode ippp0 auto   
and restart your machine.
Good luck.
Regards, 
Gerry
