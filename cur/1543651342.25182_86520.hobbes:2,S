Documentation isn't enough. It _has_ to be made simpler.
Its obvious that this is the #1 stumbling block to a 2.5 virgin right now.
I fell over it myself when I merged it, as did Linus I believe.
It's just not obvious enough.
Having it documented obviously isn't enough too. I covered this in
the document[*] I wrote last week, which got ~3000 direct hits, ~7000
or so on Linux-today, and god knows how many elsewhere.
(Either that, or my description of the problem sucked).
