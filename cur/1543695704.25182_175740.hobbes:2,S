Since I don't know what your app is doing, it's kind of hard to know 
whats causing the problem. I still would guess on a divide by zero, 
maybe because of some timing issue.
Use sigaction(2) to trap the signal, and then look at the 
siginfo_t->si_addr to find out where it happens.
Or better yet, just run the program through gdb, it will catch the thing...
