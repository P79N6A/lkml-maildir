Yes, and soon CHS will go away completely with 48-bit LBA or if you CHS
these large drives.  I considered the making of a forced policy if you
have drives beyond 80 or 100 GB but policies are pooh-poohed regardless if
they are correct.  Thus I will have to wait for the 137GB limit to enforce
the standard and make the default CHS limited to 137GB and beyond that you
have to use LBA.
