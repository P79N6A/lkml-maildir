Well, it is indeed a 2.4.3-pre feature, as I had looked for it on 2.4.2, it
was not there, but it is at least on pre8.
This new driver allows me to WOL, but only if I don't choose ACPI, if I
choose ACPI then I have the same problem as with 2.4.2. APM works ok though.
Thanks for your help, now I'm gonna ask the ACPI guys about this.
Regards...
