I had four contiguous listenings:
3 mins
10mins
19mins
13mins
When i increased the buffer in xmms i got better uninterrupted timings.
And survived data gaps better.
I seem to be getting better results than you, i think that it is not an
issue of ipv6 implementation but simply the case of time sensitive
traffic fighting with other Internet traffic over tunnels through ipv4
networks.
I do not know how many tunnels are in my path, i know that hop distance to
my tunnel is exactly 1 hop (ipv6 broker and ipv4 provider are the same)
If there is immense traffic at one of the routers (total traffic on an
interface) stream packets can be simply dropped if there are no queuing
disciplines that would take eg. flow control into account.
What do you think?
btw. what the hell is JunOs ?
