This might be a dumb question, but I would expect even on altix 
with lots of parallel faulting threads rwsem performance be basically
limited by aquiring the cache line and releasing it later to another CPU.
Do you really think it will make much difference what particular atomic
operation is used? The basic cost of sending the cache line over the
interconnect should be all the same, no? And once the cache line is local
it should be reasonably fast either way.

parisc at least iirc (it practically doesn't support very much atomically)
and likely sparcv8.
