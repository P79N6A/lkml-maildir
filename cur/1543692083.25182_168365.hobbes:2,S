I have tried, two or three times now ...
The problem is that nobody has ever reported back with results from
testing any updated patch (see attachment, the guts of this being
from Alan Stern).  Sort of makes trying be a moot point ... :)
It's OK with me if you just revert the patch that adds a uhci_reset()
entry, but based on what I saw with EHCI and OHCI that'll just turn
up a different set of problems with certain BIOS configurations (none
of which I have) ... which will need to be fixed by having a UHCI
reset sequence that works correctly from _all_ initial states.
