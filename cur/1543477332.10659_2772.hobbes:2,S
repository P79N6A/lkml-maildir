It does. Take a look:
-- C++ code --
#include <iostream>
class someclass {
  int i;
public:
  explicit someclass(int _i) : i(_i) {}
  virtual foo() {
    std::cout << i << endl;
  }
};
void test(someclass& x) {
  x.foo();
}
void main (void) {
  someclass a(1);
  test(a);
}
-- C code --
#include <stdio.h>
struct someclass {
  int i;
  int (*foo)(struct someclass*);
};
int someclass_deffoo(struct someclass* x) {
  printf("%d\n",x->i);
}
/*
 * int someclass_otherfoo(struct someclass* x) {
 *   printf("%d\n",x->i<<1);
 * }
 */
void test(struct someclass* x) {
  x->foo(x);
}
int main (void) {
  struct someclass a={1,someclass_deffoo};
  test(&a);
/*
 * a.foo=someclass_otherfoo;
 * test(&a);
 */
  return 0;
}

C++ code has one additional INEVITABLE memory reference. Not much, perhaps but
still this shows that main idea: in C coult realize far more flexible object
model then built-in object model of C++ (note commented lines of C sample :-)

Not at all. Take Java. Replace bytecode with real native code and all is done :-)
Just to use well-know language for samples. AFAIK latest versions of Oberon
also include support for real classes... Where you could change base class and
got derived class with changed behaviour without recompilation...
