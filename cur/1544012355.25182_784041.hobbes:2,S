Thanks, I didn't know that!

I think I'm not explaining myself correctly. My code has _nothing_ to do
with ext2/3/4 (or any other filesystem) whatsoever. I'm not using the
journal as an external one for a filesystem. I want to use it to be able
to do atomic writes in my own, filesystem independant, device-mapper
code.
After what you told me (both this and the deprecation of
jbd2_journal_create()), I took a look at e2fsprogs' source. From what I
could see, "mke2fs -O journal_dev" creates the external journal inside
some ext2/3/4 structures, which caused my journal-loading code to fail
(because it doesn't know about ext stuff).
So, I wrote a small "mkjournal" utility that creates a journal on the
block device without any ext2/3/4 stuff. It's based on e2fsprogs'
mkjournal.c, except it doesn't have any ext2 stuff. And it worked great!
I'm now able to load the journal just fine.
Thanks a lot for all the help!
