I think it will happen eventually. However, my first priority
personally is to get the macio code working on non-PCI macs
to get the onboard stuff onto the driver model. I did look at
it, and NuBus does lend itself to this conversion due to the
fact that it does in general have devices that can be detected
at runtime and a lot of generic infrastructure. It's just a
matter of priorities and a lack of time all around.
