Was this patch meant to be applied to a fresh 2.6.13 kernel without
any of Ed's patches? If so, I cannot confirm that this patch works.
The aoe driver still reports a wrong size:
sunny:~# modprobe aoe
aoe: aoe_init: AoE v2.6-10 initialised.
 etherd/e0.0: unknown partition table
aoe: 0011xxxxxxxx e0.0 v4000 has 7441392446501552128 sectors
The exported file has got a size of 19088743 sectors.
Regards,
Jim
