OK this is not pretty but it is actually correct.  Notice how we only
overstep the mark for E_KEY but never for D_KEY.  Since D_KEY is only
initialised after this, it is OK for us to trash the start of D_KEY.
It's just a trick that makes the code slightly nicer (and no I didn't
write this nor am I necessarily condoning it :)
Thanks for reporting this though.
Cheers,
