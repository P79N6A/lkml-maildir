Your analysis might be right, not the fix.
You *cannot* assume curr->next = NULL will be done before insert.
You probably also need a memory barrier.
	curr->next = NULL;
	memcpy(curr->comm, comm, TASK_COMM_LEN);
	smp_mb(); /* commit all writes to curr before insert */
	if (prev)
		prev->next = curr;
	else
		*head = curr;
