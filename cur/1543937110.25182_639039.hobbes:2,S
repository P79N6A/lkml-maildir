hmm.. can p->sighand be NULL here? If so, there also is a problem in the
task_sig() function in the same file.
In fact that code is copy&paste from task_sig(). In fact I'm not even sure
if I actually need to lock anything to access p->signal->rlim.. I've
searched the kernel code a bit and it looks like most acesses to the rlimits
are done unlocked, which is no problem imo given the typical change-pattern
of this values..
anyone a clue on this issues?
yours,
