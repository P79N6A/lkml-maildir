Please wait until you see a complete implementation that actually works. I'm 
sitting here quietly, following (and now breaking) the "If you can't say 
anything positive, don't say anything at all" line because I think that the 
more into the implementation details people get, the uglier this is going to 
show itself to be. I'm perfectly willing to be proven wrong, but haven't seen 
anything so far that's even begun to convince me otherwise.
Regards,
Nigel
