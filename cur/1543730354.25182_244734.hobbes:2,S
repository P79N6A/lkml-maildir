This is very strange. 'inotify device opened' is printed when an app
opens /dev/inotify. Do you have code that is doing that? I am wondering
if inotify's MAJOR/MINOR is getting confused with device mappers. I
don't know how it could be happening since /dev/inotify has the kernel
assign it an available minor number, and its major number is the major
number for all misc char devices.

Could you find out what the major/minor numbers are on /dev/inotify and
whatever dev device mapper has?
Thanks for testing.
