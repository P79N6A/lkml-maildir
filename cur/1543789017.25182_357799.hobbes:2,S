oz 3.5.4 is due for release soon and will hopefully have a 2.6 option
for spitz.

Its outdated now.

At what level? machine_is_spitz() and machine_is_tosa()? There are some
checks in the sharpsl head file to auto detect all the Zaurus machines
and set the machine numbers. For those two machines the difference is
the presence of the tc6393 chip in tosa. See head-sharpsl.S

I got a spitz recently which moved 2.6 for it forwards a lot. Have a
look at:
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/
This file should give you an idea of which patches to apply in what
order:
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/temp/linux-openzaurus_2.6.14-rc1.bb
With my patch series applied, we're missing usb client (usb host works)
and sound support.
Mainline is missing power management and currently fails to compile
without my patch series but I'm working on that.
