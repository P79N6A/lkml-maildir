Hi.
I have a problem with Sleep button events. dmesg shows this:
ug 16 22:44:27 lapek ACPI: AC Adapter [ADP1] (off-line)
Aug 16 22:44:27 lapek ACPI: Battery Slot [BAT0] (battery present)
Aug 16 22:44:27 lapek ACPI: Power Button (FF) [PWRF]
Aug 16 22:44:27 lapek ACPI: Lid Switch [LID0]
Aug 16 22:44:27 lapek ACPI: Sleep Button (CM) [SLPB]
Moreover:
Aug 16 22:44:27 lapek input: Power Button (FF) as /class/input/input0
Aug 16 22:44:27 lapek input: Lid Switch as /class/input/input1
Aug 16 22:44:27 lapek input: Sleep Button (CM) as /class/input/input2
Aug 16 22:44:27 lapek input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard as /class/input/input3
Aug 16 22:44:27 lapek input: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad as /class/input/input4
When I do cat /dev/input/event* I can see events on input1 generated
by lid on input0 generated by power button but no events on input2 :(
In fact all events from Sleep button go input3 (normal keyboard input)
and are transleted to system trough this. Sleep button generates
KEY_SLEEP evnets which is catched by gnome-power-manager so I have
suspend functionality in X but no in "pure" console mode (no X
running). How can I make these events to be generated on input2?
Regards Michal.
