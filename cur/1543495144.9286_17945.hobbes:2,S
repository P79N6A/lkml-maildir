> How can I get in touch with people how is doing the benchmark?
Maybe these:
Bob Young, President of Red Hat Software
Andrew Tridgell <tridge@samba.org> of the Samba team
Jeremy Allison <jallison@cthulhu.engr.sgi.com> of the Samba team
Alan Cox, who seems to be involved
John Taschek from PC Week at john_taschek@zd.com
The benchmark operation seems to be located in one of two places:
a. North Carolina's Research Triangle, which is perfect for Red Hat.
   I guess davem@redhat.com could end up with the job.
b. Foster City, California, 20 to 25 miles from Linus. Is he busy?
   This is SVLUG territory AFAIK. Hopefully rioting can be kept to
   a minimum. Jeremy Allison seems to be in the area.
