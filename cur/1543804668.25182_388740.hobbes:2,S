Just to mention, that 2.6.14.2 does not have this problem:
vip ~ # cat /proc/slabinfo | grep scsi
scsi_cmd_cache        60     60    384   10    1 : tunables   54   27
8 : slabdata      6      6     27
but my guess is that the problem may be not in SCSI, as not /and
previosly actually/ I have this:
vip ~ # cat /proc/slabinfo | grep reiser
reiser_inode_cache 556594 556614    408    9    1 : tunables   54   27
8 : slabdata  61846  61846      0
which seems too high too
