This code generates more expensive shifts than our (ARMs) existing C
version.  This is a backward step.
Basically, shifts which depend on a variable are more expensive than
constant-based shifts.
I've not really looked at the rest because I haven't figured out which
bits will be used on ARM and which won't - which I think is another
problem with this patch set.  I'll look again later tonight.
