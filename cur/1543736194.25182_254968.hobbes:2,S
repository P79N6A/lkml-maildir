Oh dear, now we're back to the phase of the moon theory?  I don't go 
to that church.
I didn't change anything else John.  I had previously rebuilt rc2-mm2 
2 times because I'd found that cachefs wasn't what I thought it was 
and took that back out, leaving me still stuck at 10 fps for either 
instance and I did check.  Applied the subject line patch, 
rebuilt/reboot again without even calling a make xconfig, and I get 
250 fps.  Steady, rather than fading down to the 100 fps in about a 
minute like all previous kernels have in this 2.6.8 and up series.
Several things are locally built here: X, amanda, kde, cups, 
gutenprint, sane, xsane and all kernels.  I don't think yum replaced 
anything but mozilla (up to 1.7.3 now) last night.  Not according to 
the email I got from it anyway.  That, and this patch are the only 
diffs.  I've since did the patch that takes out the #define from the 
radeonfb.h file but I haven't rebooted to that kernel yet.  From my 
read of that file, its just housekeeping, like sweeping the floor.
