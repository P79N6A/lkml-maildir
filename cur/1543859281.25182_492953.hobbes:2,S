oops - my intention was to set all IRQs and softirqs to SCHED_FIFO prio 
50. I have fixed that now in my tree.
prio 99 is pretty extensive and makes it hard to move tasks 'above' 
hardirq priority, without setting the priority of /every/ IRQ thread. So 
i picked SCHED_FIFO:50 - at exact half way.

ok - lets try it. Clark: does this impact the set_kthread_prio utility? 
I've changed "IRQ 123" to "IRQ-123" to make pidof & friends work better.
