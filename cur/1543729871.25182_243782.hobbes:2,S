    That was one of the problems I was having: overwriting the memory
you already have is easy, but moving... I mean, you realloc and move
the memory but the kernel doesn't notice it, am I wrong?

    Exactly ;)

    I'm VERY interested, but the problem is that in any case I won't
be able to use that in my programs since portability is sometimes an
issue :( Not all OS are able of such things. The problem, in the end,
is that changing the name of the process is not a standard thing...
    Thanks for your help :)
