   Finally found the schematics on AMD developers' site. Yes, the issue 
existed on DM2301 -- they didn't wire CF pins 43/44 for DMA. If only my 
board was alive... :-)
   CCing Jordan, AMD Geode guru (not sure if he's still active). Jordan, 
do you by chance know if the Insyde BIOS for Geode GX2 supported DMI at 
all so that we can identify it easily?
