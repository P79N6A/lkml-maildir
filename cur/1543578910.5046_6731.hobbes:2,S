I have a FIC PA-2007 (the older one, with a 586A bridge instead of the 586B
of later FIC PA-2007 boards), running at 75MHz FSB (PCI bus runs at 37.5MHz,
so I suppose I should use idebus=37.5 if I were to try 2.4.x), and a Quantum
Fireball lct15 30MB.
It works flawlessly in UDMA mode 2 (although I have to force the drive to
UDMA mode 2 with -X66 before enabling dma, because the bogus beta BIOS I use
sets it to UDMA4 which is not supported by the 586A). Kernel is 2.2.18,
without the 2.4.x ide backport.
The lspci output is exactly the same as yours.
