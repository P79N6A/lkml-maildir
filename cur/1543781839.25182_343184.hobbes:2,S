This is getting hung up on one particular example, while missing the
bigger picture.
Being able to set rlimits for other processes is useful in general, just
as things like nice() and sched_setscheduler() are. Maybe it is reducing
max RSS on certain processes and increasing it on other processes, so that
the memory tends to be used for higher-priority processes. Maybe it is 
setting max cpu time to T+5 minutes, so that if a seemingly stuck process 
has not exited in five minutes, it will die. Maybe it is limiting  the 
number of processes that a daemon can spawn.
In addition, it's not always practical to have application authors provide 
a management interface.
You're right that there can be potential problems with adjusting rlimits 
on the fly, but that doesn't seem like a sufficient reason to avoid 
including the feature.
Best,
