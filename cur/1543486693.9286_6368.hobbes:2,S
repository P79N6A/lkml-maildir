Your friends are quite wrong. VESA does _not_ improve graphics in
Windows 9x. The place were vesa helped was back in the dos days. VESA
used to be a blessing in disguise for demo coders. It provided a layer
of abstraction for all the different chipsets (through the VBE).
Nowadays, this layer of abstraction is provided by the OS in the case of
Windows, or X in the case of Linux.

If you compile VESA into the kernel, it'll be used in fbcon, and you'll
see the pretty penguin upon boot up. This shouldn't affect XFree one
bit.
