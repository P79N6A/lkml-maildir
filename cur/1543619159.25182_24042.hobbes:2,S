I've got an idea - if you were saying that ping host->guest is fine,
but other way around it does not work. Can you apply 
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/vmware/vmware-ws-1455-update5.tar.gz
to your VMware 3.x? Stock vmware-3.x modules use netif_rx() instead
of netif_rx_ni(), and so network bottom half was not run under some 
conditions.
Patch also allows you to run VMware on 2.5.3-pre5, BTW.
