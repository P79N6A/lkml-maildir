Hm.  We have an interesting clash of conventions here.
On the one hand, we have the java-style accessor convention.
get_personality()/set_personality().
On the other hand, we have reference counting.  get_cpu()/put_cpu().
When I first saw this patch, I assumed the latter (and went looking for
the missing put_), but _personality is of the former style.  I have one
suggestion (that nobody is going to like), which is that we suffix
reference-counting functions with _ref, ie:
get_cpu_ref()
put_cpu_ref()
pci_get_device_ref()
pci_put_device_ref()
pci_dev_get_ref()
pci_dev_put_ref()
(PCI is actually a good example here; it has "get" referring both to
refcounting and to accessors)
