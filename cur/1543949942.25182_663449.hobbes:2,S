Well, I think some of the confusion is simply from people who already 
turned it off *before* (without problems), and now just do "make 
oldconfig" or otherwise just keep it off, and it causes problems for them.
Updating the help text won't do squat, because those people won't be 
reading it - maybe they read it back when it was a new option (and it 
worked for them), but not any more.
So I would almost suggest we simply force the option back on for now. 
Then, in 2.6.26, we can make it a question again, and by that time, people 
will have it as 'y' in their config files and will now have the option to 
turn it off again.
In other words, how about just this diff?
