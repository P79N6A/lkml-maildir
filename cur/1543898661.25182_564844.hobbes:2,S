It gets complicated when this has to be added and TESTED in EVERY 
driver. The implied contract for drivers previously was that their 
device would not get accessed after it was suspended until it had been 
resumed first. This proposed change violates that.
I don't think this sort of handling is something that individual drivers 
should have to deal with (at least not ones that are part of a framework 
like USB, libata, etc.)
