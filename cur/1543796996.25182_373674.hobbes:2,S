Subject: [PATCH] Trivial fix in __alloc_bootmem_core() when there is no free page in first node's memory

Hi,
    Hitting BUG_ON() in __alloc_bootmem_core() when there is no free 
page available in the first node's memory. For the case of kdump on 
PPC64 (Power 4 machine), the captured kernel is used two memory regions 
- memory for TCE tables (tce-base and tce-size at top of RAM and 
reserved) and captured kernel memory region (crashk_base and 
crashk_size). Since we reserve the memory for the first node, we should 
be returning from __alloc_bootmem_core() to search for the next node 
(pg_dat).
Currently, find_next_zero_bit() is returning the n^th bit (eidx) when 
there is no free page. Then, test_bit() is failed since we set 0xff only 
for the actual size initially (init_bootmem_core()) even though rounded 
up to one page for bdata->node_bootmem_map. We are hitting the BUG_ON 
after failing to enter second "for" loop.
Please apply.
Thanks
Haren
