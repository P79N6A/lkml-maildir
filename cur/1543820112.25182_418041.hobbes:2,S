Subject: [FIX] ide-io: increase timeout value to allow for slave wakeup

During an STR resume cycle, the ide master disk times-out when there is also 
a slave present (especially CD).  Increasing the timeout in ide-io from 
10,000 to 100,000 fixes this problem.
Andrew, do I have to send a patch or can you take care of this one-liner?
Thanks!
