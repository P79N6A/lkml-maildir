The whole idea of VFAT usage is interaction with Windows9X/NT. If you do not
need it then use ext2fs, reiserfs or whatever. And since Windows9X/NT
hounrs short names Linux should as well (Windows9X will be VERY upset if
you'll create new file with LFN "PROGRA~1" along with usual "Program Files"
with short name "PROGRA~1").

Exactly :-) BTW all ioctls are in place...
