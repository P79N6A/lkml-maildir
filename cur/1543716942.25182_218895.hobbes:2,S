I am developing a usb device driver in linux 2.4.
I have a foolish question, how can linux system differentiate usb drivers according to PID&VID.
And, I use "devfs_register(...)" to register a device node in "/dev", it seems that there is no effects, no new files created in "/dev" . Could somebody give me some examples.
THANK YOU.
