You are right to 99.9% ;)
The last 0.1% of wrongness comes from linux/stddef.h:
...
#define NULL ((void *)0)
Thus, !ptr is equivalent to ptr==0 but not equivalent to ptr==NULL
in general case for the kernel code (it is equivalent if ptr is
a variable of a _pointer type_ because ptr then implicitly converted
to (void*)).
Our NULL isn't 0 by design. it's not a bug, regardless what Stroustrup says
about NULL define.
