I've been considering for a while that, in addition to ->probe and ->remove, we
have the following:
"struct device" -->
->attach - binds to the device and allocates data structures
->probe - detects and sets up the hardware
->start - begins transactions (like DMA)
->stop - stops transactions
->remove - prepares the hardware for no driver control
->detach - frees stuff and unbinds the device
->start and ->stop would be optional, and only used where they apply.
->probe and ->remove would be useful for resource rebalancing
Power management functions could (and usually should) manually call some of
these.  Also this would be useful for error recovery and restarting devices.
Still, cpufreq seems like a difficult problem.  What's to prevent,
hypothetically, an SMP system from stoping a device while the upper class
layer tries to use it.  If the class level locks control of the device, then
DMA can't be stopped.  Also, attempting to stop device activity may fail
if the driver decides it's not possible.
Thanks,
Adam
