No, no -- as far as I know khudb gets rid of things in a perfectly correct
manner.  But there are plenty of other parts in the Linux kernel, and I
don't know that they all delete things bottom-up.  Greg implies that
usb-serial and the kernel's tty subsystem don't do this; I haven't had a
chance to look into it.
