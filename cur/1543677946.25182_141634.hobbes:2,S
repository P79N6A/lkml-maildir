           Summary: ltp ajdtimex failures
    Kernel Version: 2.5.72
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: johnstul@us.ibm.com
         Submitter: johnstul@us.ibm.com
Distribution: SUSE 
Hardware Environment: AMD64/i386 
Software Environment: ltp-full-20030606 
Problem Description: 
	ltp adjtimex01 and adjtimex02 tests fail.  
Steps to reproduce: 
	Boot a 2.5.72 kernel 
	Run ltp 
The problem is related to some time cleanups that went in recently. TICK_USEC has 
been changed to be based off of TICK_NSEC which is ACTHZ based. However 
TICK_USEC should be USER_HZ based.  The kernel rejects adjtimex changes to 
timex.tick (tick_usec)  if the value is outside 9,000->11,000 usecs per tick 
(USER_HZ=100), however now TICK_USEC is ACTHZ based, adjtimex is returning 
timex.tick values ~1,000 usecs per tick (HZ=1000).  
Currently working with George Anzinger and Eric Piel to resolve this issue.
