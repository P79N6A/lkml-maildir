Somebody correctly pointed out that you do not need any out-of-band 
encoding mechanism - the very fact that it's an invalid sequence is in 
itself a perfectly fine flag. No out-of-band signalling required.
The only thing you should make sure of is to not try to normalize it (that 
would hide the error). Just keep carrying the bad sequence along, and 
everybody is happy. Including the filesystem functions that get the "bad" 
name and match it exactly to what it should be matched against.
