Could someone please explain to me how this works? IIRC NFS uses
generic_file_read as most other filesystems. And whe WaitOnPage in there
sleeps in uninterruptible state. I was told, that though it would be
easy to change here, it's almost impossible in page-fault, because
trying to handle a signal might trigger the very same page-fault again.
