Yes in 99% cases. If you really want _VESA_fb ...

Yes. As long as "all places" support iX86 real mode...

And VESA standard only supports such thing from iX86 real mode.

Correct. But if you want use VESAfb you should play by VESA rules. And VESA
rules (as of VESA 2.0) are simple: the ONLY way to select video mode is to
call specific int from real mode. Sometimes you should even load DOS's driver
to have such ability.
