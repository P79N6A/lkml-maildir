See 
http://webcam.sourceforge.net/
 for current driver.
I don't know if it's any faster though.
Are you using the parallel or USB camera?

There was a big email thread about this.
You could do as Linus says that he does and build it
in /home/joeja/..., such as
/home/joeja/kernel/v2.4-test8/ or whatever naming convention
you like. 
For the other software needed for 2.4 kernels,
you'll need to read /your_path_choice/linux/Changes .
It lists all software updates that are needed.
[If you want to read it before downloading all of
the Linux 2.4 kernel, I can send it to you tomorrow
or you should be able to view it at a Linux xref
web site.]
