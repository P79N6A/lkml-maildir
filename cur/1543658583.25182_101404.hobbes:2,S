  Anyone who wants to be able to debug a problem should be playing with
that, it's one thing which affects the whole kernel, and is't really a
hack in the usualy sense. And sysctl isn't really a hack, it's just
another feature (my opinion).

  Clearly not, it's not processor dependent or even architecture dependent
generally. It's a characteristic of the os, unlike microcode, mtrr, and
other stuff not on some architectures. You can select it for 386/486/P5
(and it works in 2.4 at least, for P5, have several).
  I would think that processor options would select the processor and any
options which are specific to it rather than generally supported. Serial
numbers, firmware loads, that sort of feature.
  Preempt and smp, are general, I guess not supported on every possible
hardware, but certainly not restricted to a single model or family.
