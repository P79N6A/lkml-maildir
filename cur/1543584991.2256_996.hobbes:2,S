Ok I understand better now.
So when we swap in, the place is still reserved in swap for the next time we swap off the same memory part.
The swap is freed only when the owner terminates.
Then when we need more memory, we need to swap off but we don't use the duplicated part.
I understand that it is to avoid fragmentation but this can lead to false OOM situation (false because we have free memory in swap but it's reserved to avoid fragmentation).
