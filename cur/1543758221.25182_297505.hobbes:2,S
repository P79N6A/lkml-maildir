I think the problem is that you have totally bogus EDID data coming from
DDC. I'm still curious what makes a difference between module and
built-in. Either we try to set a bogus mode, or we just fail setting a
mode at all and fbdev doesn't deal with that properly.
Did you try plugging a different monitor ? Also, do you have output with
a recent X.org (6.8.2 for example) ? Can you send me that log too ?
Ben.
