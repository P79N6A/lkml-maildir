Discussions with Ulrich have reaffirmed my opinion that pthreads are
crap.  Hence I'm not all that tempted to warp the (nice, clean,
usable) futex code too far to meet pthreads' wierd needs.
However, it's not too hard to implement condition variables using an
unavailable mutex, if we go for "full" semaphores: ie. not just
mutexes.  It requires a bit more of a stretch for kernel atomic ops...
Yet another untested patch,
Rusty.
