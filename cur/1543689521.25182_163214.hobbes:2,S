I think mremap() on block of memory containing futexes is reasonable.
Imagine a big data structure with a table futex locks at the start of
it.  I'm not sure how useful it is, but it's not worthless.
Anyway, I have a patch, tested, which moves remapped futexes _and_
returns EFAULT to waiters when pages are unmapped.  It's kept separate
from the main futex patch so you can accept it or not.
