Right at the moment, we're requiring the 1.1 56 byte response because
the request has byte three zeroed (sas 2 requires responders to return
the 1.1 response frame in this case).  I suppose if we ever need to do
zoning, there might be a case to move to larger sizes, but at the moment
it would just tell us about features we're not using anyway (plus we're
bound to confuse some older expanders).
