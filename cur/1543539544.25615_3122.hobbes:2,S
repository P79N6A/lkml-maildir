	Peer review has shown itself to be a good thing.  This is how
Linux came to be as it is today.

	Now look, does it violate the SPEC or not?  You've claimed elsewhere
that it doesn't violate the SPEC, but isn't specifically a part of it, and 
yet here you claim it does violate the SPEC.

	This isn't about control.  It's about succuming to one man's desires
instead of considering the impact of such a change based on its technical
worth.

	Again with the threats of imminent doom and impending danger.  This
is just not the way to win people over to your side.
	You do realize this *isn't* anything new, right?  For quite some
time now people have been able to flash the bios on their IDE and SCSI
disks, just like their motherboards.  In the past this has been done from
DOS, but obviously anything done from DOS can be replicated under Linux.
You could destroy the disk under DOS by doing the same as the update
program except giving it garbage instead of the real bios.  So it is the
same under Linux, except you have to gain root access first.
