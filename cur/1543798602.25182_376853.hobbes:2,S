[My Radeon 9250-AGP is fine, Helge's 9250-PCI is dog slow]

1280x1024.
I think we can fairly say that there's a system config difference here
of some kind. :)

... as with my 9250.

True enough.
I'll admit I'm not sure why you're seeing such a speed difference if
hardware rendering is on; an order of magnitude seems a bit much just
for PCI versus AGP. Perhaps Dave knows?
