Subject: [PATCH] ebtables - Ethernet bridge tables, for 2.5.34
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello David, list,
Ebtables is a project similar to iptables, but working on the bridge netfilter 
hooks. It allows for a basic transparent firewall, making a brouter and doing 
MAC source address and destination address manipulation. The firewall part 
has currently modules for basic IP filtering, 802.1q filtering, ARP 
filtering, logging and a mark match/target.
Ebtables has been under development for over 1.5 year and has more than 100 
users, I think.
The patch is 3662 lines long, so I won't list it in this mail. It is available 
at:
http://users.pandora.be/bart.de.schuymer/ebtables/v2.0/ebtables-v2.0_vs_2.5.34.diff
or, gzipped:
http://users.pandora.be/bart.de.schuymer/ebtables/v2.0/ebtables-v2.0_vs_2.5.34.diff.gz
It is vs 2.5.34, I can make a patch vs 2.4.x when the time is right.
Comments/questions are appreciated.
For more information, see

There is an ebtables hacking howto, some basic examples and some real life 
examples from users. And ofcourse the userspace program.

cheers,
Bart
