Ah.  Yes, that will definitely happen.  We only have atomicity
at the level of a single printk call.
It would be feasible to introduce additional locking so that
multiple printks can be made atomic.  This should be resisted
though - printk needs to be really robust, and needs to have
a good chance of working even when the machine is having hysterics.
It's already rather complex.
For the rare cases which you cite we can use a local staging
buffer and sprintf, or just live with it, I suspect.
