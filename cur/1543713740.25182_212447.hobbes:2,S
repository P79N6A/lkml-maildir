This is xfsdump making requests of the SCSI tape driver with buffers
which are too large for it to pin down, the warning is harmless and
ST chugs on.  I believe the warnings will be fixed in future kernels,
and xfsdump/xfsrestore will need some tweaks to use more appropriately
sized buffers.

This looks like a use-after-free - freeing an inode for a second
time, I think - I haven't come across this one before.  I expect
the second oops and pagebuf warnings will be a follow-on effect
from this initial failure.  The initial failure will need some 
more investigation - if you can reliably hit it pls let me know
what/how you're doing that.
thanks.
