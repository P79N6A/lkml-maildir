Perhaps this has been asked many times here; I don't usually read this list,
but I can't find an answer anywhere else.
I upgraded to kernel 2.6.0, then 2.6.3,
and dhclient won't work, because I didn't say yes to CONFIG_FILTER.
But aha, CONFIG_FILTER is gone.  Nowhere to be found.
The config options before and after this one are still there,
but CONFIG_FILTER is not in Kconfig at all.
What should I do?
