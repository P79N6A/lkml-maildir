This is actually simply reversing this patch:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=109268755500248
And all it does is give us the previous consequences back.
The oops isn't in the eh it's in the usb-storage eh routine.
However, the current host code does need fixing, but the fix is to move
it over to a proper state model rather than the current bit twiddling we
do.
