"upcall" is poorly defined.
What I meant was that ELSA can perform its function when the kernel merely
sends asynchronous notifications of forks out to userspace via netlink.
Further, I'm wondering if CSA can perform its function with the same level
of kernel support, perhaps with the addition of netlink-based notification
of exec and exit as well.
The framework patch which you sent was designed to permit the addition of
more kernel accounting code, which is heading in the opposite direction.
In other words: given that ELSA can do its thing via existing accounting
interfaces and a fork notifier, why does CSA need to add lots more kernel
code?
