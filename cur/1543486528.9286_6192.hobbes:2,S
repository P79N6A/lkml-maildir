I have done this, and I am currently re-writing it from scratch, for 2.2
http://isunix.it.ilstu.edu/~thockin/pset/
  is the URL for the old code...it
is currently undergoing a complete from-scratch rewrite, with new features.
Features do/will include:
	new system call  sysmp (compatible with SGI)
	library wrappers for bind_to_cpu()    (digital UNIX)
	library wrappers for processor_bind()  (Sun? - who uses this?)
	Restrict processors from running general processes
	lock a process to a processor, or set of processors
	remove a processor from general use, and lock it to a single process
		(and it's children)
	disable a processor from scheduling any processes
does this sound like what you want ?
