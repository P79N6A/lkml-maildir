Subject: [PATCH] Document SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED/RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED deprecation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/17/409

Apparently it's not cool anymore to use SPIN/RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED.
There's some mention of this in Documentation/spinlocks.txt, but that
only talks about dynamic initialisation.
A comment in the code mentioning the preferred usage would be good IMHO.
