Linus's current kernel tree, i.e., the latest git tree or
git snapshot preferably, or at least use the latest -rc if there
is one.  IIRC, the patch was against 2.6.20.2 (or .3), but it does
not apply cleanly to the current mainline tree.

Sounds like they should all be static except for rsa_modexp().
If other functions need to be made non-static later, that's trivial
to do.  And if loadable modules should be able to use rsa_modexp(),
then it needs one of these:
EXPORT_SYMBOL(rsa_modexp);
or
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(rsa_modexp);

You can split the line's source code without making it be multiple
C-language statements.  I'm just talking about source line length here.
E.g., instead of (this one long line):
+			tmp[j] = product = tmp[j] + (m * (u64)nbuf[j]) + (product >> 32);
use:
			tmp[j] = product = tmp[j] +
				(m * (u64)nbuf[j]) + (product >> 32);
or:
			product = tmp[j] + (m * (u64)nbuf[j]) + (product >> 32);
			tmp[j] = product;

Well, from a higher level, the code looks very 32-bit focused.
How well does it work on 64-bit CPUs?

I don't see a good way to do that.  I guess we need to set up a
foundation and have a coding contest.  8;)
Hm, won't swab32() help with that?  and access the byte array
4 bytes at a time instead of 1 byte at a time?
Something like (not tested, with size converted to number of
u32's in the str[]):
	for (i = size - 1, j = 0; i >= 0; i--, j++)
		data[j] = swab32((u32)str[4 * i]);

How time-critical is the code?  Is it used often or just once when
loading a module?  If it's not used frequently, I'd go for readability,
maintainability, and understandability.
