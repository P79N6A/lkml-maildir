The asumption is that 802.11d information, like current "regdomain"
settings, is fixed and not user-configurable.  If the regdomain is
changeable by the user, that unit would not be approved for sale in that
particular locale.
(Now 802.11d doesn't specify what to do when you hear two conflicting 
 802.11d beacons.... there go those assumptions again..)
Stations respecting 802.11d rules are not allowed to transmit on any
supported frequency until they hear an AP on that frequency first.  
This essentially means that all scans are passive until we hear an AP,
and we can't transmit on any other (presumably still silent) frequencies
unless we hear an 802.11d beacon that says we can.
