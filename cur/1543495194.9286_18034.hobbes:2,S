I have a sparc10 that I installed debian 2.1 sparc on.  I can't get it to
boot off the hard drive.  It always complains about no disk label.
The kernel on the cdrom is 2.2.1
The bootloader is silo.
The disk is a 1.3gb with 2 partitions.  First partition is almost the entire
disk with type 83.  the 2nd partition is about 20mb type 82.
ROM is v2.12
32mb ram
