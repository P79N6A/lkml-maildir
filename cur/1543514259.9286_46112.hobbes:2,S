Hi all,
We are working on a driver for a two line LCD panel. We have a (portable)
version running on PC and SA-1100 LART[1] that does a lot of udelay()s
between the states of the LCD protocol. Yes it works, but the udelay()
effectively blocks the complete system.
The solution is to break up the write routine and use a task queue
fucntion instead, but this makes the device even slower (visibly, that
is). Each run of the task queue selects the next state in the LCD
protocol. If we use the timer task queue it is just plain slow, if we use
the scheduler task queue, the speed depends on the number of processes.
Is it possible to get the device faster without having to use udelay()?
