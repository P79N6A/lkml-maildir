+9. Legacy I/O port free driver
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+On the large servers, I/O port resources could not be assigned to all
+PCI devices because it is limited (64KB on Intel Architecture[1]) and
+it would be fragmented (I/O base register of PCI-to-PCI bridge will
+usually be aligned to a 4KB boundary[2]). On such systems,
+pci_enable_device() and pci_request_regions() for those devices will
+fail because those functions try to enable all the regions. However,
+it is a problem for some PCI devices which provide both I/O port and
+MMIO interface because some of them can be handled without using I/O
+port interface. The reason why such devices provide I/O port interface
+is for compatibility to legacy OSs. So this kind of devices should
+work even if enough I/O port resources are not assigned. The "PCI
+Local Bus Specification Revision 3.0" also mentions about this topic
+(Please see p.44, "IMPLEMENTATION NOTE").
+
+This problem is solved by telling the kernel if your driver needs to
+use I/O port to handle the device. If your driver doesn't need any I/O
+port regions to handle the device, you can tell it to the kernel by
+setting PCI_DEVICE_ID_FLAG_NOIOPORT flag in the ID table like below:
+
+	struct pci_device_id your_id_table {
+		...,
+		{
+			...,
+			.device_flags = PCI_DEVICE_ID_FLAG_NOIOPORT,
+			...,
+		},
+		...,
+	}
+
+If the PCI_DEVICE_ID_FLAG_NOIOPORT flag is set, kernel will never
+touch the I/O port regions for the corresponding devices.
+
+By using ID table, you can tell the kernel whether to use I/O port by
+per device ID basis. However, some drivers might need to check other
+information than in table ID (e.g. revision ID) to see if they need to
+use I/O port. In this case, you can use the no_ioport flag in struct
+pci_dev. If the no_ioport flag is set, kernel will never touch I/O
+port regions for the device. You would check some information to see
+if your device needs I/O port, and you would set the no_ioport flag as
+necessary. Please note that you need to set the no_ioport flag before
+calling pci_enable_device() and pci_request_regions().
+
+[1] Some systems support 64KB I/O port space per PCI segment.
+[2] Some PCI-to-PCI bridges support optional 1KB aligned I/O base.
