(scratches head).
Oh yeah. Hmm. Ideally the kernel should be recompiled for the target
hardware that is to be used, but this could prove to be a problem for
people who install a distribution and never upgrade the kernel I suppose.
Point noted. Will remove this 'feature'.

Another oops on my part. I only have x86 hardware, so didn't test this.

I disagree. Someone at M$ thought so too, as all flavours of Windows
prints its proper name too. Though this doesn't necessarily imply they
know what their doing, they've provide completely seperate drivers
to the RTL8029 & CT528.
If you don't think that determining the name of this clone is necessary,
why do we determine the name of the other clones? The only difference
is that this clone needs a few lines of code. If that's the problem,
the driver could be rewritten to check subsystem vendor instead of the
vendor field, and then just add the CT528 to the pci_clone_list.
Would this be a preferable method ?

d.
