No, I don't know it. Sometimes merging can be tricky, but then I check the 
original diff and apply it manually. What I'm planning involves no logical 
changes, so it would be an absolute no-brainer to merge. It's the logical 
changes that may even compile normally, that can be the a real PITA.

I already did the complete conversion (and I did it forward and backward 
to be sure the result is the same), so I dont see the problem to merge it 
in 2.6.13. The final removal of the thread_info field can happen in 2.6.14 
and any missed changes in external trees are trivially fixable.
