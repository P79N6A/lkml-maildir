I got the following on my machine
Pentium III, 128MB, Linux 2.4.13 while running make dep on 2.4.14
sa1100fb.c:164:27: linux/cpufreq.h: No such file or directory
sa1100fb.c:166:26: asm/hardware.h: No such file or directory
sa1100fb.c:169:28: asm/mach-types.h: No such file or directory
sa1100fb.c:171:30: asm/arch/assabet.h: No such file or directory
 From my .config
#
# Frame-buffer support
#
# CONFIG_FB is not set
The files mentioned do not exist in arch that is i386. This driver seems
to be for the "arm" architecture.
I was wondering why this file is used in make dep. Did I miss something or
should I wait for kbuild in 2.5?
