Bad WP bit on a 386 - need an extra test at least.
No invlpg instruction - must invalidate the whole cache.
No byte swap instruction - must shift and mask and add/or.
IRQ 13 is used for both SMP and FPU - trouble AFAIK.
The second problem at least could be mostly fixed with
self-modifying kernel code. Nobody cared enough though,
since the 386 is so uncommon.
Most 386 hardware doesn't even have enough memory for normal
Linux distributions. Linux in 2 MB takes some skill.
