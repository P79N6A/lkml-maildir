Can someone explain me why the debug registers from an i386
are no longer saved in the tss (especially DR6). This was the 
case in the 2.0.x series and was removed in 2.1.0 
(arch/i386/kernel/entry.S).
Is there a good reason for that ? Without this, there is no
way you can do decent hardware assisted debugging under Linux.
thanks for your answers
A+
