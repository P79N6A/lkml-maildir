Point, but then we might want to export the damn thing in properly
named version (i.e. put it into __.... reserved namespace).  It
doesn't depend on anything kernel-specific...
FWIW, the current version suffers from similar problem - it's outside
of __KERNEL__ in userland-exported header and it can lead to breakage
when included in build by something other than gcc...
