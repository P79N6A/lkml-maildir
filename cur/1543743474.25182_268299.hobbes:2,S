Hi,
On Thu, Nov 04, 2004 at 01:28:34AM -0500, foo@porto.bmb.uga.edu told us:
> -CONFIG_IP_NF_AMANDA=y
did you see today's postings from Matthias Andree on this topic??
It turned out that ip_conntrack_amanda changed some packets and
that's why the UDP checksum was wrong. It seems like ip_conntrack_amanda
is build into the kernel on one of your machines.
