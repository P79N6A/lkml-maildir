It's interesting to see all the free unixes, Solaris and SCO have no
trouble mapping files.  But AIX, HPUX and whatever environment you
have on Windows XP couldn't even do the mmaps.
Could you be able to try the aix/ppc, hpux/parisc and Windows XP (or
any Windows) tests again, but this time try each of these:
	1. Compile with -DHAVE_SHM_OPEN
	2. Compile with -DHAVE_SYSV_SHM
Thanks again,
