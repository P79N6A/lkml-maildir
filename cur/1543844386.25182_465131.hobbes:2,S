Possibly never. Marvell don't currently seem to want to play. Now that
might be for several reasons, one of which is that its someone elses
chip rebadged. In that case someone has a chance of working out what it
copies (eg which bits change when you boot with or without a master or
slave on each channel is a good clue)
The current prognosis however is that you and/or other marvell users are
going to have to reverse-engineer the thing or just avoid boards using
that chip.
