By and large ... here's a counterexample:
static struct pci_device_id tg3_pci_tbl[] __devinitdata = {
        { PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, PCI_DEVICE_ID_TIGON3_5700,
          PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0UL },
        { PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM, PCI_DEVICE_ID_TIGON3_5701,
          PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0UL },
...
I don't think anyone would appreciate you converting that to:
static struct pci_device_id tg3_pci_tbl[] __devinitdata = {
	{
		.vendor		= PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM,
		.device		= PCI_DEVICE_ID_TIGON3_5700,
		.subvendor	= PCI_ANY_ID,
		.subdevice	= PCI_ANY_ID,
		.class		= 0,
		.class_mask	= 0,
		.driver_data	= 0,
	},
	{
		.vendor		= PCI_VENDOR_ID_BROADCOM,
		.device		= PCI_DEVICE_ID_TIGON3_5701,
		.subvendor	= PCI_ANY_ID,
		.subdevice	= PCI_ANY_ID,
		.class		= 0,
		.class_mask	= 0,
		.driver_data	= 0,
	},
...
Not unless they're paid by the line ;-)
