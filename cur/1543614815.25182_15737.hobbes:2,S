I have a single 512 meg DDR DIMM and have not experienced the problem
you are.

Just to relate another lockup mystery with the K7 Soyo Dragon Plus,
after install it would lockup within 3-20 minutes repeatedly under
2.4.16, 2.4.9, and 2.4.2.  I messed around in the bios until I mangaged
to get most of the cards on their own interrupts, still locked hard.
The only way I was able to get the system stable was to remove the 2
3c905 (one was a straight 905, one was a 905C-TXM) from the system.  I
replaced them with a 3c590 and its been stable ever since.
