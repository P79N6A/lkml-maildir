Is there anything wrong with enabling write-allocation for
the entire memory range, including the missing 8k?  The kernel
won't write anything to the "missing" memory anyway.
Looks like the bios does this already in some cases,
so it doesn't seem too wrong. 
And it enables write allocation for the last 3MB.
