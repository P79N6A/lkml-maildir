One of the ARM machine types which I consider being closest to being
completely buildable in Linus tree was this -><- close to being buildable
between 2.5.49 to 2.5.50.
In 2.5.49, it failed because we had a couple of references in ide.c to
functions previously removed.  In 2.5.50, the IDE DMA stuff changed and
made icside.c unbuildable.  I'm not going to get a chance to look at this
for a while, so don't expect it to change.
Not only that, but the ARM module stuff needs changes in mm/vmalloc.c so
we don't have to have a _third_ ruddy implementation of the same code.
(which currently causes a link error.)  mm/vmalloc.c needs to become more
general - basically "allocate a region of size A alignment B between
address C and address D".  Oh, not to mention the inherently racy code
found within mm/vmalloc.c
I'll now step off my soap box. 8)
