So, by your argument, if you _have_ to have an IRQ translation layer anyway,
then what's the problem with having zero as a valid IRQ and using some other
value to indicate an invalid IRQ?  As you say, you have a translation layer
anyway...
That would mean the arch maintainer could make the optimal choice for their
arch - perhaps picking 255 which would be consistent with PCI.
As far as FRV goes, I'm quite happy with 0 as being NO_IRQ, since the 0 bit in
the primary PIC registers is the master switch, not a per-level bit (there are
no source indicators unfortunately).
However, x86, x86_64, and others *do* treat IRQ 0 as being valid, and expose
it to userspace in various ways:
	warthog>cat /proc/interrupts 
		   CPU0       
	  0:  287035291    IO-APIC-edge  timer
	...
So on *that* basis, using IRQ 0 to indicate unset/invalid/etc would seem to be
bad.
