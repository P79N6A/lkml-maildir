I upgraded to a more recent commit,
92d499d991ec4f5cbd00d6f33967eab9d3ee8d6c
and rebuilt.
Now I get lots and lots of AoE errors, over and over again, but no GPF.
aoe: can't get a frame. This shouldn't happen.
It's possible the previous kernel had been patched, so I made really
REALLY sure that this was a 100% clean build using the above commit. I
can build using more or less any other commit or tag upon request but
it's not quick.
