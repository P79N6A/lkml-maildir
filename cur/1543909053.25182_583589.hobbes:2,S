How?  The cache driver acts on behalf of someone else.  That someone else has
one security context, but the cache itself has to have a different context so
that the cache can be shared.
Furthermore, the cache driver doesn't have a security context per se.

It introduces more complexity, which I believe you were just arguing against
above...  It also incurs more kernel threads - which I really really want to
avoid.
I would rank the complexity and resource overhead of the act-as stuff in LSM
(or at least in SELinux) as much less than what you're suggesting.
As it stands, the FS-Cache layer has a pool of threads that CacheFiles makes
use of, but this can't be bound to the security of a specific cache because
there may be more than one cache of more than one cache driver type.

I don't see how act_as compares to access().

That sounds like it'd be the complexity thing again...

I suspect that's more by the fact that security wasn't particularly thought
about when these interfaces were first written.  As with everything in the
kernel, it might be negotiable.

Meaning you think I should just give up on this?
How about I reduce the interface I'm proposing to two functions:
  (1) int security_act_as(struct task_struct *context)
	Temporarily make the current process act as the given task, including,
	for example, for SELinux, the security ID with which this task acts on
	things, and the security ID with which this task creates files.
  (2) int security_act_as_self(void);
	Restore the context as which we're asking.
This would mean that the task's security context would have to be able to store
acting security IDs for everything, but I don't think that's too much of a
stretch resourcewise.
