I've made a patch against kernel 2.3.44, to be found at
           
ftp://oboe.it.uc3m.es/pub/Programs/proconfig-0.9.tgz
I've tested that it works, but haven't tested every single compile
combination. It was slightly difficult to get my portable up and
running on 2.3.44, apparently because make menuconfig, make oldconfig
were both thoroughly broken. I suppose people know that.  So I
settled for "works". Anyway

I still need to replace the shell script it adds to scripts/ with 
a piece of C code.  I'd post the patch here but it contains a
large auto-generated chunk listing all the kernel config options that
would be extremely boring. Yes, it should pollute /proc/sys/ instead of
/proc. Tomorrow.
