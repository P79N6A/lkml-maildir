Since Scsi_Host:this_id is an integer, it's impossible that a
TransportID (which is what you use to identify the port) would ever fit
into it, since these are defined to be at least 24 bytes long.

Actually, it may not be in HCIL, but it is in the transport classes
(although the only implementor is FC at this time, I think).  And that's
where it should be since format and contents of the transport ID are
transport specific.
