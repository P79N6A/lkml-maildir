Ok, is there a generalized API or sysctl to collect the loaded drivers and
their settings so we can have an 'lssound' like 'lspci'?
Card config: 
ESS Maestro FM port at 0x388
ESS Maestro MIDI port at 0x330 irq 7
ESS Maestro at 0xec00 irq 5
Audio devices:
0: ESS Maestro-2E Rev. Q
Synth devices:
0: Yamaha OPL-3
Midi devices:
0: Maestro external MIDI
Timers:
0: System clock
Mixers:
0: ESS Maestro (TRA6)
The above is much more informative than trying to grok /proc/ioports and
interrupts and related.
If you don't save your settings somewhere, /proc doesn't tell you enough to
set them in a new kernel compile.  /proc is only reporting settings
currently in use and that can lead to an information decay if for example
MIDI isn't used for a while and the config is eventually lost.
One has to resort to shooting in the dark to find where it's at again.  PCI
makes things much easier, but a good many of us still have ISA sound which
really hates being autoprobed.
