Oh, I see you're splitting an existing resource around it.
So the e820 map requests reserved regions with tentative and
insert_resource is allowed to place resources into tentative regions. 
That works for me, but I don't see how it works for the bridge
case...there you really want to insert the bridge resource over
everything else.
