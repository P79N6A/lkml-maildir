I'll provide another data point on this issue.  For about two years, my
Cyrix P150+ box would crash 1 out of 3 times during kernel builds with
spurious signal 11's.  No rhyme or reason - the location was random and
non-deterministic.
Finally, after a suggestion from Alan Cox, I picked up a Pentium 166 and
replaced the CPU.  Haven't seen so much as a hiccup from the box since
then (about 8 months now).
This is almost certainly a hardware problem.
