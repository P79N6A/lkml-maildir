There's something strange going on with either ACPI or cpufreq. When
the system boots, I see that the CPU is correctly detected as a 1200
MHz mobile Athlon, but once I log in /proc/cpuinfo says it's 2.6 or 3.6
GHz CPU. I don't have the laptop with me right now, but I'll send the
boot messages tonight.
