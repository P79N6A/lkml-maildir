Yes, but meanwhile it forked, producing a better OS: Minix.
Now there's Hurd on the horizon, Eros looking like reviving the `debate' about 
microkernels, and no reasonable facsimile of a version control or patch 
submission system for Linux.

From one marketing front man to another: I respect your desire to keep the 
brand name pure, but what's in a number?  Something for real marketing front 
men to put on a press release?  What's it got to do with the *other* use to 
which one might put Linux ... experimenting with new features?
What'd be really nice would be a system where people could directly submit 
branch material, others could selectively check out branches, and still others 
could (if they wished) re-join the branches.
Linus could bless branches, so could you, but people should be able to roll 
their own to a much greater extent, if Linux is to maintain any kind of 
growing edge.
Another lesson from history is the gcc/egcs development.  I'd say Linux's in 
the balance now, but if I were intimately involved with the kernel, I'd be 
open-sourcing it as quickly as possible.
Colin.
