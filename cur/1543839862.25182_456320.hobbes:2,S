IMHO just some stucks is tolerable for .18 and .18-stable, as long as it doesn't 
add new crashes and the fallback always gives an useful backtrace (that is why I 
added the fallback -- to make sure no information is lost) 
Short term the stucks are a bit ugly but I hope with .19 or .20 longer 
term we will have much better backtraces without false positives
(ok assuming people turn it on). The code queued for .19 should
be already pretty good now (ok after I fixed one nasty problem yesterday
that added some new ones compared to .18)

I looked at it a bit, but it puzzles me. The chaining for the interrupt stacks
on i386 -- which is what seems to be corrupted here -- shouldn't have changed at all 
by the unwinder changes.
I suspect it would crash without unwinder too. Bruce, do you get the 
same crash when you boot with "call_trace=old" ?
