Of course I perfectly understood what you meant. I designed the current
way of doing the CONFIG_X86 some years back so I know what you mean.
Just re-read the previous email with that in mind. What I meant is that
4096bytes of virtual vmalloc space doesn't worth a CONFIG_F00F IMHO.
While CONFIG_F00F isn't wasted user time because the user won't see it,
it still clobbers the source code, but nevertheless it is better than
the current halfway broken #ifdef CONFIG_M686 and that's why I said if
somebody bothers to verymicrooptimize I'm ok, I just won't microoptimize
myself and I'd drop CONFIG_M686 instead.
