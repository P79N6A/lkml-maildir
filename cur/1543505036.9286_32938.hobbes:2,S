pre-faulting would need to not prevent a minor fault, so that we could
track the application's progress through the file to determine that it is
still streaming.  but if a minor fault still occurs, even if it's mostly a
nop, does that make anything more efficient?

i have something i can send you now.  it doesn't adjust the trigger point
automatically yet (it still uses a trigger point a half cluster before the
end of the read-ahead window), since i've been on vacation.  i'll try to
post it later today.
i've been testing with grep and mpg123, so i know my implementation is
working.  but i don't have anything real that gobbles data fast enough to
really compare with the old filemap_nopage.
