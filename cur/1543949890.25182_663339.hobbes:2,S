Nope.  paravirt_enabled().

No, this isn't executed when booting under Xen.  Xen is a bit magic, and 
has its own kernel entrypoint which the domain builder finds via 
Xen-specific ELF notes on the vmlinux.  We plan to move to booting via 
this path at some point.

Just because something is paravirtualized and uses a non-PC 
hardware_subarch doesn't mean this stuff isn't present.  Even the 
paravirt_enabled() test isn't accurate, because the environment may 
still choose to emulate these things (or in the Xen dom0 case, it may 
directly expose the real hardware).
