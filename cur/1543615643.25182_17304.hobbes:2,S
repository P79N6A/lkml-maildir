The kernel doesn't timestamp the logs, AFAIK.  That is done by syslog when
it writes the logs to disk.  If you check "dmesg" output - no timestamps.

Restart syslog so that it notices the new timezone, or something else, I
don't know.  IIRC, you are the one doing strange things with syslog.
Are you doing network syslog logging now?  Are both of your hosts running
with the same timezone?
Cheers, Andreas
