OK, why is this still happening? Haven't we been asking JVMs to use
futexes or posix locking for years and years now? Are there any sane
jvms that _don't_ use yield?

It is a performance regression. Is there any reason *not* to use the
"compat" yield by default? As you say, for SCHED_OTHER tasks, yield
can do almost anything. We may as well do something that isn't a
regression...

What makes you say that? IIRC of all the things that sched_yeild can
do, it is not allowed to block. So this is about the only thing that
will break the standard...
