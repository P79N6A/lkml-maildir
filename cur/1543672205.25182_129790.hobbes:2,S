I know the relatively small fifos. On the other hand compared to the ridiculous
throughput of 8 kByte/sec (single channel) (which most people seem to ignore in
this discussion), it is ok.
Let me simply ask back: is the IDE code in nowadays 2.4 kernel so bad, that a
dual 1,4 GHz PIII cpu with 3 GB ram performs much worse than a 90 MHz P I with
64 MB and OS/2 on it???
_My_ isdn drivers showed _no_ such problems under OS/2 and IDE load...
How did we manage to become that bad?

I know HFC is nice. But that cannot mean ISAC/HSCX must have dropouts. You have
to have long interrupt lock outs for such a behaviour, which cannot be intended
at all.
