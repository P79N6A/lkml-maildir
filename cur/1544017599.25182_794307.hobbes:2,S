I have had a look at them, (and I raised some concerns about races with
the bufferhead "defragmentation" patch which I didn't get a reply to,
but now's not the time to get into that).
Christoph's design AFAIKS is not impossible with queued slab allocators,
but they would just need to do either some kind of per-cpu processing,
at least a way to flush queues of objects. This should not be impossible.
But in my reply, I also outlined an idea for a possibly better design for
targetted slab reclaim that could have fewer of the locking complexitiesin 
other subsystems like the slub defrag patches do. I plan to look at this
at some point, but I think we need to sort out the basics first.
