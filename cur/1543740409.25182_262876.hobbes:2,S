An experimental feature I've heard being proposed is to generate font
bitmaps dynamically on the card. The idea is to load the TrueType
glyphs onto the card and then generate a temp bitmap when you know
exactly the size/subpixel alignment that you need. Implementing this
probably means you need 3D FP transform units. This is just an
experiment proposal, no one has built it yet so no one knows if it is
going to work very well. It might be an opportunity to try for some
patents.
