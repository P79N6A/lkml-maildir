i picked up everything from Jan that would apply - please yell if you 
still see something not absolutely squeeky clean ;-)
btw., we should convert all those current:
 config ARCH_POPULATES_NODE_MAP
         def_bool y
 config AUDIT_ARCH
         bool
         default X86_64
 config ARCH_SUPPORTS_AOUT
         def_bool y
instances to select lines after config X86 / config X86_64.
KGDB just followed the current Kconfig style status quo.
