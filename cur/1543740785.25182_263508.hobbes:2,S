If you start competing based on interface, then that gets us right back 
to where we are now:  vendors so protective of their interface that they 
don't want to open source their drivers...  and each chip requires its 
own separate OS driver, with its own separate engineering team and 
brainshare.
A big bonus of my point #6 is that this is irrelevant -- if everyone is 
using the same, simple "do GL" interface, then you are competing on 
features/cost/time-to-market/etc., not interface.
I thought Alan Cox's point was fairly relevant here:  there are at least 
five(?) video chips out there with hardware docs available, but no 
engineers to write a complex 3D driver from scratch.  If your company 
_leads the industry_ in creating a standardized interface, doesn't 
everybody benefit?
Another advantage is that a simple "do GL" interface is much more 
"future-proof" interface, since it is a very high level interface.
