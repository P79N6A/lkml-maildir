Not sure what do you want to do with that, but it may be critical for
many things.

I think you'd have to perform some recover procedure then, that's similar
to DCE losing sync.

If your clocks are synchronized (for example, if you get a "master"
clock from your public phone exchange and you propagate it downstream,
or your machine is the "master") then you never drop anything, the
input and output rates are equal and in sync.

Sure. Even at 100% you can just drop a frame, HDLC applications must
be prepared for it.

Well, with software framing it would look a bit different - there
is no such thing as "packet" as both TX and RX is continuous, not
aligned to anything etc. You would have to detect channel boundaries,
and bit-shift the data. Requires the sync serial controller (and FALC)
in transparent mode (I would have to look at some docs). I think
the kernel is a better place for things like that due to latency
issues.

BTW: An HDLC frame can use many slices. You can in fact have many
HDLC frames (from different streams) multiplexed. You just need
a multi-stream device or a multiplexer.

If you want the userspace HDLC bridge... I'd use a pair of T1/E1 cards
with generic HDLC support, for example, Cyclades PC300 (never used them
and while I don't exactly like their driver, in case of problems I could
add T1/E1 to my own driver which currently supports PC300 X.21 and
V.24/V.35).
Once T1/E1s are working and the required slots are selected:
sethdlc hdlc0 hdlc (options)
sethdlc hdlc1 hdlc (options)
ifconfig hdlc0 up
ifconfig hdlc1 up
man PF_PACKET
A single HDLC stream is a simple thing because it's exactly what
the cards are designed for.
