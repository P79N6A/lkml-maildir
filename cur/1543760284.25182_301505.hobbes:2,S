Also the 2.6 kernel is Soo much better in the case where you have many 
threads (even if they are all completely idle) that that improvement may 
be masking the regression that Ken is reporting (I've seen a 50% 
performance hit on 2.4 with just a thousand or two threads compared to 
2.6). let's face it, a typical linux box today starts up a LOT of stuff 
that will never get used, but will count as an idle thread.
