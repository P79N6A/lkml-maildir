OK.  That's not necessarily a bug: one could envisage a (weird) piece of
code which takes a lock then releases it on a later workqueue invokation. 
But I'm not sure that nfs4_laundromat() is actually supposed to be doing
anything like that.
Then again, maybe it is: it seems to be waddling through a directory under
the control of a little state machine, with timeouts.
Neil: help?
