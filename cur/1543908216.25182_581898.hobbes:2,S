Hi Kame,
Actually the number of pages resident in memory brought in by a
container is charged.  However each such page will have a meta_page
allocated to keep the extra data.
Yes, the accounting counts the number of meta_page which is same as
the number of mapped and unmapped (pagecache) pages brought into the
system memory by this container.  Whether pagecache pages should be
included or not is configurable per container through the 'type' file
in containerfs.
