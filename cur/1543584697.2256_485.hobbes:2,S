I did not propose an API or library which would be equal amond equals
with first rate citizens of pci_alloc_xxx and friends. I pointed out
that driver can do tracking of reverse mappings at very little cost
by using offset [Alan remarked to that how hash can use page number];
so, one may say that I supported DaveM's viewpoint. No wonder he did
not object.
