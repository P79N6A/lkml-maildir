Another thing would be to use netconsole to send event messages over the 
network to a central loghost. This would eliminate the buffer overwrite 
problem unless you sent more messages than the backlog queue is able to 
hold before the packets are being processed. But you could theoretically 
send 10 MB messages per seconds that could also be stored.

I will shut up now as I do not want to waste your and the others 
precious time with my extensive schmoozing ;).
