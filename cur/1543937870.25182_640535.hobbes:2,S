The primary problem arises because of cpumask_t local variables.  Until I
can deal with these, increasing NR_CPUS to a really large value increases
stack size dramatically.
Here are the top stack consumers with NR_CPUS = 4k.

And I've yet to figure out how to accumulate stack sizes using
call threads.
