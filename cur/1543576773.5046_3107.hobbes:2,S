No. "index" only gives the virtual index.
"page - mem_map" is how you get the _physical_ index in the zone in
question, which is common for physical tranlations (ie "pte_page()",
"page_to_virt()" or "page_to_phys()")

Look at the code - it's a big multiply to do a divide by 68 or similar.
Quite expensive.
Doing "page->address - TASK_SIZE" on x86 for the non-highmem case would
probably be faster.
