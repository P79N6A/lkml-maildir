I think Arjan has them, or the AIO patch.

Well what we can do in there is to just have a one-deep percpu list.
So the exitting task frees the previous thread's stack (if any)
and inserts its own stack.  And that stack can be used in fork, of
course.  Which gives some per-cpu LIFO stack allocation.
It would mean that the thread would have to exit with preempt disabled,
but AFAIK that's just a matter of fixing or deleting that debug warning.
