So are page-fault and memory allocation events, because thread
blocks on them, and deadlocks involving servicing page fault or memory
laundering have definitely been seen.
We have (incomplete) description of kernel lock ordering, which is
centered around reiser4 locks, but also includes some core kernel stuff.
It is available at
