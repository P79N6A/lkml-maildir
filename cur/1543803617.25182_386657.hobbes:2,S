Disable dri in your xorg.conf first, (remove the Load "dri"), if that
works which it most likely will, then send me an Xorg.0.log, and a drm
debug trace (modprobe drm debug=1),
I'm going to be looking at a 64-bit machine with PCIE radeon in the
next day or two, I'll be getting one myself post LCA more than
likely...
I think more than likely we are hitting a problem where the DRM sets
up the radeon RAM controller and the X server sets it up
differently... benh has fixes for this but they need to go into the X
server driver....
