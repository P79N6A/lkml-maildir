Hi list,
upon reviewing some of my code for a device driver, I've come across:
static ssize_t uif_read(struct file *filp, char __user *buf,
  size_t count, loff_t *ppos)
{
    // Nothing read, nothing done
    if(count == 0) { return 0; }
    // Must sleep as long as there is no data
    if(down_interruptible(&Buffer_lock)) { return -ERESTARTSYS; }
    while(BufRP == BufWP) {
        up(&Buffer_lock);
        if(filp->f_flags & O_NONBLOCK) { return -EAGAIN; }
        // hm, the condition is not atomic or locked...
        if(wait_event_interruptible(Pull_queue, (BufRP != BufWP))) {
            return -ERESTARTSYS;
        }
        if(down_interruptible(&Buffer_lock)) { return -ERESTARTSYS; }
    }
    // Data is available, so give it to the user
    ...
}
As you can see, I lock Buffer_lock and then check BufRP == BufWP. I do that
because in an SMP environment, either of BufRP or BufWP might have been
updated. (I.e. one CPU currently does "mov BufRP to eax; mov BufWP to ebx; cmp
eax, ebx" while another does "inc BufWP")
I would like to also lock Buffer_lock around BufRP != BufWP, but don't see a
way on how to accomplish this.
Does anybody know a way how this could be achieved?
