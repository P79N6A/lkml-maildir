Vaguely on this topic, I've been wondering if it's legal/advisable/safe
to have a netmask like 255.255.254.0 ?
Anyone?  The HOWTO is rather ambiguous about it.  I think it's legal,
but am not entirely sure.  This also seems to imply a broadcast addr. of
something like 194.111.1.255 for a network address of 194.111.0.0,
presumably that's OK too?
cheers
Neil
