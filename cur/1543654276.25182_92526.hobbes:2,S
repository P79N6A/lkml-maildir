OK, so you can analyse the data from a fully modular kernel, then use
that information to build a kernel with just the required hardware
support built in.
That will tell you what drivers are in use for the chipsets that are
present on your devices.  If you remove your foobar ethernet adaptor,
and replace it with a foobar ethernet adaptor from the same
manufacturer, it may stop working.  It doesn't achieve what the
original poster wanted.
The problem is that when it doesn't work, and somebody posts to this
list saying that it doesn't work, I strongly suspect that it's going
to be a lot more time consuming figuring out why, then just telling
them which option needs to be set in their .config.

Well, I use non-modular kernels by default, mainly because Linux
didn't have modular support when I first used it, and I don't really
find the need for them.  Most desktop users find them indispenable,
though.

There already is a kind of autoconfiguration - reading the help text
for each option in xconfig usually says, "If you're not sure say
[Y|N|M]".  Why doesn't the new xconfig just have the ability to set
all of the options the the recommended ones?
