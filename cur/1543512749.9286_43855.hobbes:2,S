We have one 4xSMP machine that isn't quite stable. As long as it's
not loaded, it stays up but under load it tends to crash. We started
seti@home on it and there it went ..
It was running 2.2.13pre11. Because it crashed in select_dcache, and
I haven't seen any references to that in Alan's 2.2.13preX changelog
files I thought it might be useful to post the decoded oops here.
This Oops was repeatedly printed on the serial console. The machine did
still reply to pings, but not much else, probably because it spent all
its time in the serial console printing routines ..
I'm now going to compile & install 2.2.13pre17. We'll see how it
holds up.
