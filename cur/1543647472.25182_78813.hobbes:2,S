Subject: [LART] inode mismanagement in hugetlb code

[A discussion of the meanings of the terms "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY" appears
in RFC-1123; the terms "MUST NOT" and "SHOULD NOT" are logical extensions of
this usage]
	a) inodes MUST have an address of valid struct super_block in their
->i_sb.  Had been discussed quite a few times already.
	b) inodes MUST NOT be allocated by code that isn't called from
alloc_inode().
	c) inodes SHOULD NOT be kept around for noticable intervals without
a dentry pointing to them.
	d) people who choose variable names like htlbpagek SHOULD be sent to
produce a street map of R'Lyeh.  On site.
