Is there an OF ISA binding for x86 somewhere?  And don't
point me to the source code, I'd like to see an actual
reference doc ;-)

Please remove disabled code.  And don't use // comments
at all please.

No parentheses around return value.

This would warn on 64-bit systems, better write it as
(u32)(u64)name (and make sure that "name" is somewhere
in the low 4GB of memory).  This doesn't handle 64-bit
client interface either btw.

No braces around single statements.

Why this #undef?  That's nasty style, and this is at the
end of file anyway.

Better use a normal comment.

You missed "instance-to-interposed-path" (standard, although
not required).

My mailer messed up this line, that means you have trailing

Same here.

Better make the #define correspond to the file name.
