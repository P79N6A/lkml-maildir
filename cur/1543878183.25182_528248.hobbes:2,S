No replies, huh?
My knowledge of the code which you're touching is not strong, and my spare
reviewing capacity is not high.  And this work does need close review by
people who are familar with the code which you're changing.
So could I suggest that you go for a dig through the git history, identify
some individuals who look like they know this code, then do a resend,
cc'ing those people?  Please also cc linux-kernel on that resend.

I suspect the people who developed and maintain nsproxy would disagree ;)
