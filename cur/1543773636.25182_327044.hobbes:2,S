Hi,
I had a server crash while it was running rsync to an nfs mounted 
directory.  At the time of the crash ksoftirqd was using 99% of the cpu.  
The last message in the syslog was:
kernel: 3w9xxx: scsi0: WARNING: Character ioctl timed out, resetting card.
I suspect that this was not what cause the crash but only a symptom.
I tried to "magic sysrq" (I do have it enabled) but was not able to get 
any information.
I have seen that many people have had problems with ksoftirqd taking up 
all the cpu and crashing the system but I could not find what was causing 
the problem or the proper fix.
My system:
- 2.6.10-1.760_FC3smp (stock Fedora Core 3 upgrade) 
- e1000 network cards
- acpi is enabled
Thanks,
David Hammer
