You think requiring a FIRMWARE UPGRADE is something that should be done 
in the middle of a kernel bugfix series?  What Q/A planet are you from?
This is a completely ridiculous burden you are placing on the individual 
user.  A good driver knows that firmware NOT SHIPPED WITH THE KERNEL 
does not necessarily move in lock-step with the kernel driver.  You are 
welcome to GPL your firmware and ship it of course....
