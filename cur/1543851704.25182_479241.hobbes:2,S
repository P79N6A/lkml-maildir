thanks. from what i found on different postings, it seems that this issue 
really has been adressed several times.
have seen it for 2.6 kernels though, vmware still recommending disabling 
ipv6 for suse 10.1 , but maybe this is just for "historical reason". 
furthermore jesper reported it for 2.6.18, but maybe that the problem now 
happens under very rare circumstances.
probably worth mentioning here, that two probably related bugs are in "not 
resolved" state at:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6698
 and 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6197
i will keep an eye on our systems and report if i can see this on any more 
recent kernels.
thanks for your help!
roland
