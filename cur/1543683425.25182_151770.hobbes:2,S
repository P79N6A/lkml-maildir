Therein lies the problem with large MAX_SLEEP_AVG values. It may prevent 
interactive tasks from becoming non interactive (which is the point), but if 
an interactive task turns into a true cpu hog it can literally stall the 
machine for seconds. Which is why the workaround in O*int that allow small 
MSAs help.
