Perhaps linux should keep it's momentum toward p9-ish and implement a
factotum service.
Note what we're trying to do:
	1. make the mount tree as dynamic as possible, per-process.
	So my /var/spool can be completely different from yours,
	on the same machine.
	2. but to let process p5 authenticate as root, privileged code
	trusts info stored in hardcoded pathnames in p5's current mount
	tree.
In other words, we want to prevent just a few pathnames from being
replaced through a bind mount/pivot_root/whatever.
Would make much more sense to have one thread running in an initial
private fs namespace, using pathnames it knows it can trust to dole
out privs.
I recall at last year's OLS Eric Van Hensbergen led a talk to discuss
problems involved in allowing unprivileged user mounts, where this
idea came up.  But of course no one (that I know of) has been crazy
enough to try it.
