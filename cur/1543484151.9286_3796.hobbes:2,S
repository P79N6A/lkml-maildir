You assume that lock daemon state will not change. If we have no lock daemon
response remotely we should wait. If we fail to talk to it we can error. We
shouldn't assume we can decide at mount time if there is a lock daemon either.
How does following the same rules as the file system sound - soft you timeout,
intr you ^C out and hard you sit and wait ?
