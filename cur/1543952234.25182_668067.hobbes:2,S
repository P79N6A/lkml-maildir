Subject: [PATCH 4/5] don't panic if /sbin/init exits or killed
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

If the buggy init exits, the kernel panics. I see no point for this. It is very
possible that the system is still usable enough, at least to read the logs and
prepare the bug report.
Change exit_child_reaper() to do BUG() instead of panic().
