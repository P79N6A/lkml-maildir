but it's the relativities that get skewed by HT, fundamentally - both
with and without idle=poll. A function that does not generate alot of
HT-yield activity will fare much less on the profiler histogram than a
function that happens to hit some contention point every now and then.
Also, cachemisses get far more prominent due to HT (they are a yield
point too) - suppressing other, possibly more important functions in the
list. So a kernel profile done under HT gives a rough idea but a
function could easily have half the overhead that the profiler credits
it to have. Profiling under HT magnifies the effect of lock-contention
and cache-misses, and shrinks the effect of algorithmic overhead. Plus
this skewing is not deterministic, it depends on the actual system
activity.
unfortunately i see no good way to do reliable time-based profiling
under HT, given the interaction of logical CPUs. The virtual CPUs break
the single-EIP notion of 'what is this physical CPU doing now'. Perhaps
it would be more reliable to not use time but use some of the other
triggers: e.g. # of uops retired?
