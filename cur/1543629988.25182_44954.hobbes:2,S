Actually, it happens because of the standard initrd.  In the initrd we 
load scsi_mod first, and on initialization scsi_mod attempt to 
request_module the host adapter, but there is no /sbin/modprobe (and no 
/etc/modules.conf for modprobe to read either) so you get the error above.  
Then, the initrd continues on to load the specific scsi modules.  So, in 
actuallity, it makes sense to *disable* this entire code section if scsi 
is a module because it will *always* be loaded before the host adapter (it 
has to for dependancy's sake) and will always be a failure.  When compiled 
into the kernel I'm not sure it makes any sense either since if the scsi 
driver isn't loaded yet, then where would we be getting modprobe and 
/etc/modules.conf from?  It would either have to be an initrd (in which 
case the linuxrc script can load the module manually) or / is on ide (or 
something like that) which doesn't depend on our host adapter, in which 
case it makes no sense to go around loading things without them being 
specifically requested.  Personally, I think this code should just die, 
period.
