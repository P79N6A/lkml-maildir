The first (non released) versions of these patches modified rmap.c to
move the pages between the LRU:s both during adding and removing
rmap:s, so the mapped LRU would in that case keep mapped pages only.
This did however introduce more overhead, because pages only mapped by
a single process would bounce between the LRU:s when a such process
starts or terminates.
The split active list implementation by Nick Piggin did however only
move pages between the active lists during vmscan (if I understood the
patch correctly), which is something that I have not tried yet.
I think it would be interesting with 3 active lists, one for unmapped
pages, one for mapped file-backed pages and one for mapped anonymous
pages. And then let the vmscan code move pages between the lists.
Thank you for the comments!
