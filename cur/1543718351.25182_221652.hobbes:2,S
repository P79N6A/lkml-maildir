This doesn't sound so bad at all. And this seems to be the simplest approach.

This confused me a bit. It seems that a direct consequence of implementation #2 
is that the divider will be set in a way that the low limit will be between 128 
and 255, and that there is no point in changing the divider, because it will 
only get worse. This leads directly to implementation #4. Am I missing something?
Anyway, if the user is really concerned about accuracy an average of several 
measurements should increase precision in this kind of problem. See the 
following ascii art:
clock:
     ___     ___     ___     ___     ___     ___     ___     ___
___|   |___|   |___|   |___|   |___|   |___|   |___|   |___|   |__
fan complete turn pulse:
____________________|_____________________|_____________________|
So the first measurement is 3 (assuming rising edge counting), but some of the 
period will slip into the second measurement giving a count of only 2, and so 
on. So the jitter on the counts is actually correlated with the fan speed.
Just my 2 cents,
