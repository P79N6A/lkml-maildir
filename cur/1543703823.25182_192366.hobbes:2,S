I guess a hotplug script MAY fail.  I don't think it's a good idea to make
your CPU hotplug script fail.  May and Misght are different.  It's up to the
implementor whether the script can get into a failure condition.
The hotplug script can only become unrunnable if you yank out all the CPUs
on the system.  I'd assume it would have an affinity of 0xffffffff.
What if <which> process needs guaranteed scheduling latency?  Do we really
_guarantee_ scheduling latency *anywhere*?
