Gene Heskett suggested I play around with tickadj and I found that a 
value of 9962 on this SuSE 9.2/XP3000+ has kept it rock solid over the 
last 4 days. On the x86_64 laptop with XP3000+-Mobile, it's never been 
out, both of them running 2.6.10-rc3 and using ntpd to keep in step. On 
the other box with Mandrake 10.1/XP2800+ and 2.6.10-rc3, I had to set it 
to 9958. Something has definitely changed with 2.6.10-rc3.
Regards
Sid.
