You are talking about adding hacks to workaround the
original hack.  Nothing should write to mtab.  Say it with
me "Nothing should write to mtab".
mount(8) and umount(8) are the only almost the only things that
write mtab all others are readers.  I may be wrong but the
data argument to mount(2) looks like it should support
everything missing from /proc/mounts.  Alternatively change
mount(2) and mount(8) and any other mount(2) callers will
be revealed.
The reason to leave a /etc/mtab symlink is so that the
old tools other than (u)mount don't need updates.
