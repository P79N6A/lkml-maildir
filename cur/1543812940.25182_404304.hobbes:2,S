Is this really the case? I mean interrupt disablement only synchronises with
the local CPU, so it probably should not _have_ to imply barriers (eg. some
architectures are playing around with "virtual" interrupt disablement).

But CPUs should always be consistent WRT themselves, so I'm not sure that
it is needed?
