Yes, I'd consider it a bug. Tearing down and re-creating input device
generates proper hotplug notifications and userspace needs to respect
them as capabilities may change even if ids stay the same. For example
playing with atkbd's scroll attribute will regenerate an input device
with[out] scroll capabilities but its input_id structure will stay the
same.
... Or were you talking about ids as in inputX? These are ever increasing
as new devices get created and will never be reused (as long as atomic_t
doesn't wrap around ;) )
