The logical fix would be to have the out-of-line code put into 
.text.exit.lock in this case, and then discard .text.exit.lock during the 
final link. Now, the problem is to have the spinlock code automatically 
chose the right section.
But I think, I found a solution: Don't use .text.lock for the out-of-line 
code, use .text 1 (subsection 1) instead. This will put the out-of-line 
code out of line, but into the same section - case solved ;-)
I'll patch my kernel now - since I don't have the new binutils yet, it'll 
be a bit hard to verify it really works, though.
