So if 500 million people are productive 60% of the time and hosed 40% of the
time, and 5 million people are productive 95% of the time, the 60/40 model is
better because 60% of 500M is more than 95% of 5M?
What's wrong with this picture?

Ask Joe User how he feels about NOT being able to add IPv6 support to
his existing system until his vendor says they'll do it for him, and then
look at when Linux had support.
http://www.ipv6.org/impl/linux.html
http://www.ipv6.org/impl/windows.html
And most important, google around for +ipv6 +"craig metz", and look at when *he*
did the IPv6 work - and you were free to put the patches on your system as
soon as he posted them.
Now as you were saying?
