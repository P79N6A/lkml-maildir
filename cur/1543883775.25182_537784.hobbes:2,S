My comprehension skills on Monday morning are even less than usual ;)
I would check the anticipatory scheduler as well, please.  I don't know
what no-op would do with a workload like that, but it probably isn't very
good.
You appear to believe that it's related to the CPU scheduler?  That's a bit
unexpected - it sounds more like a VFS/IO thing?  But stranger things have
happened.
I guess it's time to end the staircase experiment in -mm. 
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/js.bz2
 is my current rollup (against
2.6.21) minus staircase and related things.  Pretty please.
