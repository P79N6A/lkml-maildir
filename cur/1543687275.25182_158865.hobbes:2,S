Dave,
You're right. I did make an attribution when I posted the .18 version
of this, but I didn't this time. So,
	I believe the original code was written by someone named Andrea. It
	was a patch against 2.5.74.
	Dave Hansen and Martin Bligh were very helpful and answered numerous
	emails and gave me numerous pointers.
	Also, Mel Gorman's draft book "Understanding the Linux Virtual 
	Memory Manager" provided much useful context for me to dive into
	this code, and if I may give an unsolicited plug for his book, it's
	well worth buying. :)
Failing to gratefully acknowledge this help was a regrettable oversight.
Thank you,
Chuck Luciano
