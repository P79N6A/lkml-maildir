I disagree. A preprocessed source file with all the variables renamed to 
random strings would suffice to rebuild the binary, and is obviously not 
acceptable -- being able to rebuild the binary is not the only criterion.
	"The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
	for making modifications to it."
Note that the GPL doesn't say you have to give it in the preferred form for 
_building_ it, but the preferred form for _modifying_ it. 
In the opinion of many devlopers, the preferred form of the Linux kernel for
maintaining it is a set of individual patches against the closest
'official' release, and not a tarball containing already-modified code.
