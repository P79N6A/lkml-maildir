Um, no.  That's not correct.  Don't just paper over valid warning
messages in the kernel by adding functions that do not do anything.
Marc, why do you think that you do not need to do anything in this
function?  Don't you need to handle the fact that your code could be
removed before the release function is called?
Linus, please do not apply this just yet.
