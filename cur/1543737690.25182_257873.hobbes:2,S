is the normal way for 2.6 kernels. A plain "make" takes care of all the 
magic of building the kernel proper and the modules.

Only do that if you are sure your systems bootloader configuration is able 
to deal with it. Maybe Fedora is configured so that "make install" can 
work, I wouldn't know I'm a Slackware user myself.
Personally I prefer to manually
# cp System.map /boot/System.map-<kernel-version>
# cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-<kernel-version>
# ln -sf /boot/System.map-<kernel-version> /boot/System.map
and then edit /etc/lilo.conf to add an entry for the new kernel, followed 
by /sbin/lilo to reinstall the bootloader of course.

May I suggest reading /path/to/your/kernel/source/README it describes the 
details of building and installing the kernel, maybe you can find a clue 
to what you did wrong.

Could it be you accidentally installed your new modules in the same 
location as the old ones or that your initrd holds modules compiled for a 
different kernel than the one you just build - did you remember to update 
your initrd?

I assume you are here refering to "repair provisions" provided in the book 
"Red Hat Fedora(tm) Linux 2" you mentioned above. What does that have to 
do with the kernel? I'd suggest you take that up with RedHat and/or the 
books author.
