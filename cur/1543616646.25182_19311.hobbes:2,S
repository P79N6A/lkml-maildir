After talking with Franz Sirl abit (and reading the thread on the
patch), the fix is in the gcc-3.1 branch (so gcc-3.1.0 will work), and
the patch can be applied to 3.0.x (I've done it locally and am
rebuilding).  He's going to try and get the patch applied to the 3.0.x
branch, but isn't sure if there will be another 3.0.x release with 3.1
coming out on april 15 (if on schedule).
So should we workaround this now in 2.4.x or no?  There's other changes
which need to get into 2.4.x / 2.5.x anyhow for gcc-3.0.x to be happy on
all PPC arches anyhow.  But I also get the feeling 2.4.x and gcc-3.1
will be unsupported/not a good idea for a while to come anyhow.
