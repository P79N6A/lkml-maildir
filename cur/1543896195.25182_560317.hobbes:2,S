Patch looks good (and needed!) to me, but:
can we remove that driver, instead? 
* It breaks keyboards. Yes, we are
talking about maybe-broken i8042s, but it still breaks thinkpads at
least.
* It can be done in userspace. setleds +num; sleep 1; setleds -num <
/dev/tty1 does not seem like rocket science to me.
* if we want to do this, perhaps we should use proper led interface
(/sys/class/led) that can already auto-blink
