  Your need a NULL modem serial cable available
  from any computer store.
Install uucp - I use on the HOST :
uucp-1.06.1-33.7.2.
Also , LILO is broken on some machines and ignores
serial input so make sure you use at least
lilo-21.6-71
On the TARGET
1. Connect the serial ports together ( COM1->COM1 ) with
    the serial cable .
2. Modify LILO to use serial line on the TARGET
    add to lilo.conf:
       append="console=ttyS0,9600n8  console=tty0 "
       serial=0,9600N8
    Run lilo
3. Add to /etc/inittab on the HOST
       S0:s12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS0
4. To see ALL THE CONSOLE MESSAGES during boot on the TARGET
    mv /dev/console /dev/console.org
    ln  /dev/ttyS0 /dev/console
5. Start uucp on the HOST:
     cu -l /dev/ttyS0 -s 9600
6. Boot your target
