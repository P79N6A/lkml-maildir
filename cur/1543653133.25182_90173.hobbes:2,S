Hi,
i am seeing a hang on boot on a Crusoe based Vaio C1MHP when enabling
the ALI IDE Driver:
These are the last lines:
Unform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33Mhz system bus speed for PIO modes: override with idebus=xx
ALI15X3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 80
 pci_irq-0293 [05] acpi_pci_irq_derive   : Unable to derive IRQ for device 00:10.0
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:10.0 - using IRQ 255
ALI15X3: chipset revision 196
ALI15X3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
Kernel 2.4.19 + acpi backport + swsusp
