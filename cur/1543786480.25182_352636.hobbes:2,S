Generally, I think, all bugs fall into one of two categories.  Namely, there
are bugs that get fixed immediately as soon as someone with a clue sees
the report, compilation problems and the like, and there are bugs that
require much time to be handled.  IMHO, it doesn't make sense to litter
bugzilla with bugs of the first kind, but all bugs of the second kind
should be tracked in it, at least for the record.
Greetings,
Rafael
