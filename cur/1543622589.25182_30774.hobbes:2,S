Always racy if done in userspace, unless you introduce a centralised
"unlink daemon" (hope no glibc developer reads that, they might be
tempted to implement such an abomination...):
     proc1       proc2
   --------------------
    stat()
                stat()
    unlink()
                unlink()
*kaboom*, blackhole opens, file is gone.
/If/ you start doing such a mess (personally I don't want undeletion
anyways), please do it at least in a correct way.
