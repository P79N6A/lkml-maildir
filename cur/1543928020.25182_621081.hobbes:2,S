I've spent quite a bit of time on this issue over the weekend and have seen 
all kinds of "interesting" behavior with various kernels with different 
debug patches, but no definite clues (except confirmation that on "good" 
boots no cmd64x hardware is detected).
At some point I scrapped the virtual machine I had been using and created a 
new one. Since then I've been unable to reproduce the problem. I'm still 
quite confused by the issue exactly because it was so consistent when it 
_did_ happen and am still not sure if it can be blamed completely on the 
quirkiness of Virtualbox.
I'll keep testing new kernels in VirtualBox and will keep alert for the 
issue, but for now I think it's best to forget about it.
Bartlomiej: thanks for your feedback and suggestions.
Cheers,
FJP
