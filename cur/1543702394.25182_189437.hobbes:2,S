That would be my preference too.
I haven't studied "part II" closely enough to figure out if adding
pci_sync_consistent() would outright replace much of the DMA-API
interface. The main issue is cacheline ownership.
pci_sync_consistent() needs to indicate CPU wants ownership of outstanding
cachelines vs IO device wanting to own them.
SN2 doesn't care about the latter case since it's "mostly coherent".
SN2 just needs to flush in-flight DMA and it's coherent again.
But older non-coherent platforms do care.
I trust James understands this better than I given the fun
he's had with old parisc HW (715/50).
