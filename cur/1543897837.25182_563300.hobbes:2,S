I beg to differ. b) is *the* reason cited again and again on LKML
for submitting code for inclusion in the tree. Whenever anyone
posts anything which is remotely related to out-of-tree code,
whether it's a question on the usage of some standard in-tree
function, a request for help with a coding or debugging problem,
or out-of-tree repercussions of an in-tree change, he or she
invariably has to put up with an answer along the lines of: "put
your code into the tree and all your problems will be solved" -
or its sarcastic variant: "I can't find your code anywhere in
the current kernel sources".
You can't have it both ways. Either you go around bashing
people for maintaining their code out-of-tree or you go around
bashing people for trying to get their code into the tree.
