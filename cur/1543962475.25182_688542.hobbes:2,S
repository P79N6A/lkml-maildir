Point being that no one can force anyone to do anything in the setting
in which kernel developers work.
Distros have been doing this since ever and people have no choice but
to move on.
(Everybody works out of their own (or employer's) interest and
judgement - so telling some one to act otherwise will not be a whole
lot productive.)

I am not - my point is that you can't do  much about it that will go
long way in resolving the issue.

Well again -  you can't force people to do something like that. In
your example it would amount to the maintainer going against his/her
own judgement - however wrong it is to you and me, to the person who
can actually fix it - it's not a possibility. So you have to just
accept it and reassign it to some one else who is interested/capable -
for that I suggested tracking such bugs under a new STATUS.
