Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Multiple page size support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/6/26/17

	In preperation for the talk at this years OLS, I have put up 
my page size patch at 
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~sjw/linux-mpss/
(the actual patch is 
    
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~sjw/linux-mpss/linux-2.4.18-mpss-0.1
 
)
	This patch allows applications to map parts of their
address space using large pages, currently only on an x86 (ports 
to other architectures are planned).
	While this is still definately a work in progress, and in no way 
ready for consideration for a production kernel, I would be interested in 
any (constructive) criticism people may have.  
	The work was done while I was an intern in the Enterprise Linux
Group at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center.
	(The usual disclaimers apply --- I take no responsibility if this
causes any damage to you, your computer, your social life, etc.)
	I will put up a copy of the OLS paper and slides after the talk.
	Simon
