Subject: [RFC PATCH] pci_ids.h: cleanup: whitespace and remove unused entries

Greetings,
This patch cleans up pci_ids.h, reducing size of the file from 
104448 to 73438 bytes.  Due to the scripted changes and the 
requirement to maintain ordering within the file I had to reformat 
whitespace.
Compile tested with 'make allmodconfig' with some stuff turned 
off to get a compile completion.  No missing PCI_* symbols.
Next step is to fix PCI_* defines distributed in the source, also 
this file is meant to be included via 'pci.h' some files may need a 
reference to pci_ids.h removed.  
As attachment as patch is 92k.
Thanks,
Grant.
