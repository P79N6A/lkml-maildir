If you are talking about dynamic sizing of the number of maximum groups
per user what do you do if you resize it smaller but there are already
structures that contain more than your new size?  IOW, say the existing
ngroups_max is 64 and you have a couple of users logged in that have
50, 10, and 27 groups in their groups_struct.  What would happen if you
resized ngroups_max to 32?
