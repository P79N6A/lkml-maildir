No, it really does mean that there is no global policy, and it goes
beyond "not directly obvious" to "can not be determined" from the AA
profiles.  You can't compose the set of AA profiles and say anything
useful, because they are written in terms of ambiguous and unstable
identifiers.  /a/b/c may refer to completely different objects in two
different profiles, or to the same object as /d/e/f in the same or
another profile.

Just to clarify, you can change the allowed accesses from a given
subject to a given object without relabeling, just by changing the
policy allow rules; you only have to relabel the object in the case
where you want to distinguish that object from another object with the
same label for the same subject.  I think the new file situation could
be improved without any major change to the SELinux model, and am not
opposed to leveraging the component name there, as previously noted.  On
the file rename case, I think we have it right - access rights shouldn't
change automatically when a file is renamed, any more than DAC ownership
or file modes should.

Tranquility is important to correctness and understandability of policy;
if labels (or pathnames in your case) can change at any time, then you
have the problems of revocation of access (impractical to completely
implement in Linux) and your effective policy now varies over time, so
you have to consider time as a factor in your policy analysis.

I'd agree that we shouldn't try to emulate AA as it is on SELinux.  The
question is more of whether we can meet the higher level functionality
goals that make some people want to use AA via SELinux.  That requires
separating those goals from the implementation details of AA.
