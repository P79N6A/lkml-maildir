Subject: [PATCH 00/11] KVM updates for Linux 2.6.24-rc review
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/21/72

The following patches fix fallout from the main 2.6.24 KVM merge.  An
exception is the movnti emulation patch, which adds support for Linux
2.6.16 guests.
The patches can be found in kvm.git in the branch kvm-updates-2.6.24.
There is also a branch kvm-updates-2.6.25 which will form the basis of
the next merge window submission.
Please review the patches and let me know if something is wrong or if
a patch is missing.
