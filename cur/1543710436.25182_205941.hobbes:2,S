I was finally able to reproduce the unkillable zombie process. How to 
reproduce it:
    - launch gdb with the program in the attached tarball.
    - once the program is running you have 5 seconds to telnet on 
localhost on port 7899, and
    sit on your keyboard.
    -after 5 seconds the first popen occurs in one of the thread of kbug 
which causes gdb or the kernel to bug(waiting for new
child: No child processes.)

(gdb)
When here ask to quit, and gdb may hang:
(gdb) q
The program is running.  Exit anyway? (y or n) y
Once this is done just kill gdb(killall gdb), here i get the following:
 ps xwaf | grep kbug
 5255 pts18    S      0:00              \_ grep kbug
 1882 pts16    Z      0:00 [kbug] <defunct>
the kbug process became an unkillable zombie.
The provided trace is with the CVS of gdb but i have same behaviour with the
legacy gdb-6.0-2mdk
kbug:
kbug has a POPENFUNC which is a just call to popen(/bin/true)
threads of kbug:
    -main thread creates things(other threads) and then call POPENFUNC
    -task1 thread binds 7899, accepts the first connection and launch a 
thead "remoteworker" to treat the incoming connection, once this
    is done it calls POPENFUNC
    -remoteworker "select" the incoming connection and prints what is send
    -task2 does only POPENFUNC
   
I can provide any information that is needed.
