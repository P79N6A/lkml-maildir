No dice, I just had another dead reboot.  Nobody else seems to be seeing
this, so maybe my box is going south.  A single bit error the other day,
and now this.  Maybe it's not the kernel, just a coincidence that I've
only seen it with 2.6.16-mm1.  Maybe I've got dust crawling into memory
sockets or whatnot.  Memtest86 time.
