Why the hell is the kernel sending down a low-level format command to
media?  How stupid can we get in writing a driver?  What next, modify the
microcode on the devices between boots and kernels?
Do backup between boots if this kind of crap is going in to the base
driver.  Even MircoSoft has more brains than to permit this rogue from
their product.
