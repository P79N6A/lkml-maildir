Yes, a sysctl would probably lead to fragmentation problems and then
people would do ugly linked lists of buffers like poll.

Page flipping = COW like fork would do?
Not sure how this would work - the arguments of execve can be anywhere
in the address space and would presumably be often be in a inconvenient
place like in the middle of the stack of the new executable.
