So on the NFS client, an open with FMODE_EXEC could be translated into
an NFSv4 open with a deny_write bit (since NFSv4 opens also do windows
share locks).
An NFSv4 server might also be able to translate deny mode writes into
FMODE_EXEC in the case where it was exporting a cluster filesystem.  It
wouldn't completely solve the problem of implementing cluster-coherent
share locks (which also let you deny reads, who knows why), but it seems
like it would address the case most likely to matter.
