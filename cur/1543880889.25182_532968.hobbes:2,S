I am not saying they are wrong I am just saying that driver core is
not where most work is done. Every subsystem has its own locking rules
and lifetime rules and they are what is important. Whether subsystem
uses embedding or referencing of struct devices is implementation
detail.
What is the goal of driver core? I thought the main goal was to have
an uniform interface for device power management and presentation of
device tree to userspace. It has nothing to do with main purposes of
every individual subsystem - making some set of devices/services work.
