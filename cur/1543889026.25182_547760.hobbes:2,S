Hi Claas,
the bug is at another place. But it's hidden if X86_CMPXCHG64 is
switched of.
There are 3 errors.
First: Via is capable of CMPXCHG64, but switch the related CPU bit off
to work with old Win NT versions. ( So the NT error is the fourth... but who cares
about that error. ;-) )
Second:  verify_cpu.S
This checks during the boot the capability of the CPU. It expected
the related bit, but... see first.
This error is switched of if X86_CMPXCHG64 is disabled.
Third: setup.S "PANIC: CPU too old for this kernel." is not printed
cause of a missing set register in setup.S.
As I have learned the NX-bit of the C7 is a BIOS issue.
The only real required patch is below. It enables the right bits for the C3/C7.
The first error is out of scope, and the fix for the "CPU too old.." is for
me just a cosmetic print out in case of boot errors.
I suppose .rc3 should contain a fix for this bug.
Best regards,
Christian
