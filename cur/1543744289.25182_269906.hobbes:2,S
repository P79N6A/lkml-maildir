ELSA uses a daemon called "jobd" which is able to produce a file that
contains informations about the relationship between a process and its
job. The conjunction of this file and the per-job accounting information
(currently the BSD-accounting) allows ELSA to provide per-job
accounting. Thus, I also need per-process accounting. Maybe the per
process eop handling can be done with CSA...
