Hi Thomas:
I recently told someone in private that ACPI vs. hwmon conflicts are the
biggest open problems for the hwmon subsystem.  Thank you (and Jean) for
doing this.

Andrew has already picked this series; I vote for extended time in -mm.  On the
hwmon side, there is almost guaranteed to be fallout from this that may take
time to resolve.

As long as it's in -mm, you may as well default to =strict right away.  This
will force people to report.  Open the floodgates; I hope I don't drown.
