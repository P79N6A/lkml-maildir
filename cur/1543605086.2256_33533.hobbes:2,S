About the Oops, I think it's a hotplug problem but I could be wrong.
I get a Oops when I do the following :
. Insert my card (card detected and driver loaded)
. mount /dev/sdc0 /cdrw
. use /cdrw
. umount /cdrw
. Remove the card (remove event detected but driver not unloaded)
. mount /dev/sdc0 /cdrw (oops and mount segfault)
lspci show the adaptec card after insertion and no more after removing.
Actually the hotplug stuff doesn't unload the driver. This is not simple
because another card can use the driver. This is a new problem compared
to pcmcia stuff where you use a specific module.
My understanding is that the hotplug code should notify to the driver 
that a device managed by it has been removed. And the driver should
rescan for available devices.
I can send you the oops but I'm convinced that the Oops is caused by the
aic7xxx driver accessing a no more there device.
Is there a common way to ask to a driver to rescan it's devices (an
IOCTL). I'm afraid that not but it looks like a generic hotplug problem.
