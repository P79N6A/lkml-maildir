Nonetheless, as root, lspci already does that (it displays the MSI
interrupt info).  I  wasn't talking about fixing that, just saying
that having the data being as correct as possible, is highly
desirable.   We can't know everything that everybody is doing with
the data.
Improvements in the pciutils library and locking with respect to the
kernel may well be desirable, but are an independent issue from
correctness.
