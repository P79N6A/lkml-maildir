Yes which is why I do it just as infrequently as get_page_state.

No, it's pretty easy to reproduce, kprefetchd sits there in uninterruptible 
sleep with one cpu on SMP pegged at 100% iowait due to it. This tends to have 
noticeable effects everywhere on HT or SMP. On UP the yielding helped it but 
even then it still causes blips. How much? Well to be honest it's noticeable 
a shipload. Running a game, any game, that uses 100% (and most fancy games 
do) causes stuttering on audio, pauses and so on. This is evident on linux 
native games, games under emulators or qemu and so on. That iowait really 
hurts, and tweaking just priority doesn't help it in any way.
With this change it's much more polite and takes a bit longer to complete 
prefetching but is still effective while no longer being noticeable.

Same as above. It's the tasks in uninterruptible sleep that cause the most 
harm. I do it sequentially simply because nr_running() is more likely to be 
>1 than the sum total, and I'd prefer not to do nr_uninterruptible() unless 
it's necessary. Both of these are actually done lockless though.

Hrm. 3 years on and I still make basi style mistakes.
