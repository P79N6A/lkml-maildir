   Now all we need is for whoever ports oprofiled to a 32-bit on 64-bit
   platform to add some check for finding out the kernel's idea of what
   sizeof(unsigned long) is, and using that to read /dev/oprofile/buffer.
   Yeah ?
Wouldn't that someone be you?  It's not that hard to code, and if
it's in there from the start it would really save all of us a lot
of time.
Really, the oprofiled work to do this is going to be generic, what
isn't the generic is the "determine kernel pointer size" check.
But you can make x86 return '4' from the get-go and then people like
me will have a simple place to add the proper test for our platform.
