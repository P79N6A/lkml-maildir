Hi Gerard,
These incompatibilities you speak of, could they be the reason that
2.3, 2.2.?-ac? and 2.2-pre2 don't boot on Samsung Alpha UX
motherboards?
This is the message I get:
sym53c8xx: at PCI bus 1, device 13, function 0

2.2.10 works fine. So I copied the 2.2.10 sym53x8xx files over to
2.3.10 and 2.2.11pre2, but same thing happens, also with the
ncr53c8xx driver. So something has changed in 2.2.11pre2 and 2.3 to
break your driver.
The other compiled in drives seem to detect their controllers fine,
eg IDE.
