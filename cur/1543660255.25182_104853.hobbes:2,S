As specified in the config docs
        bool "ATA tagged command queueing (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        depends on BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
        help
          Support for tagged command queueing on ATA disk drives. This enables
          the IDE layer to have multiple in-flight requests on hardware that
          supports it. For now this includes the IBM Deskstar series drives,
          such as the 22GXP, 75GXP, 40GV, 60GXP, and 120GXP (ie any Deskstar 
made
          in the last couple of years), and at least some of the Western
          Digital drives in the Expert series (by nature of really being IBM
          drives).
          If you have such a drive, say Y here.
I've got an IBM 120GXP (IC35L060AVVA07-0)

I expected the kernel to be somehow stable. Not too much more.
I have heard, however, that TCQ'll help a lot if connecting > 1 unit to the 
same IDE bus. Is this true?
