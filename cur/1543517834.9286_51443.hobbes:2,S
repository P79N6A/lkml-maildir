I'm having problem with adaptec scsi.
It doesn't work well with many(more than 2) LVD disks on alpha.
But I'd found a posting which says he has the same kind of problem on intel
box
with latest 2.3.x kernel.
I can't remeber which mailing list it was but I tried 2.2.10 to test if it's
a new kernel's problem.
And indeed it worked fine with 2.2.10. I guess the problem has been there
since 2.2.12.
Because 2.2.12, 2.2.13 and 2.2.14pre9 don't work.
I hope this problem is resolved before 2.2.14 is released.
