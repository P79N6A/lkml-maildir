The iocb is as minimally different from the posix aio api as possible.  The 
main reason for the difference is that struct sigevent is unreasonably huge.  
A lightweight posix aio implementation on top of the kernel API shares the 
fields between the kernel iocb and the posix aiocb.

A 4G/4G split flushes the TLB on every syscall.
