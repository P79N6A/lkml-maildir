Three comments:
1. we take an extra reference on the page, how does that
   affect the test for if the page is shared or not ?
2. we call delete_from_swap_cache with the pagemap_lru_lock
   held, since this tries to grab the pagecache_lock we can
   easily deadlock with the rest of the kernel (where the
   locking order is opposite)
3. there are no comments in the code explaining what this
   suspicious-looking piece of code does ;)
regards,
Rik
