The system survives the speed change very well. I've done clock scaling on
StrongARM SA1100 CPUs (see signature), and I could change the clock speed
from 59 to 265 MHz without problems. The proper implementation should
change the value of loops_per_sec (in init/main.c), but the system
actually survives well without the change.
