The exact bookkeeping required when you do allocations
and frees on non-allocated memory (for which only the
address space is accounted) will give a little bit
(probably negligable) of overhead.
The inherent swap space overhead non-overcommit gives
isn't an issue here. People can chose for it and will
do so if they think non-overcommit is going to help
them :)
cheers,
