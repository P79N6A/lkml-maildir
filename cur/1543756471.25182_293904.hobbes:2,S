Hmm.. I always thought "A" was the _pairing_ of %eax/%edx, not "eax or
edx"?
IOW, as far as I know, I'm telling the compiler that the asm is writing a
64-bit value into %eax:%edx, and that that __ret_pu gets that 64-bit value 
assigned to it (and truncated, at that point). No?
Note that he code that actually writes to the register is the assembly 
code, and that one always writes to %eax. So the compiler doesn't get to 
"put the return value" anywhere. It gets told where it is.
I'd happily use your version, but I thought that some versions of gcc
require that input output registers cannot overlap, and would refuse to do 
that thing? But if you tell me differently..
