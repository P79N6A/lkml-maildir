There is some documentation in Documentation/filesystems/driverfs.txt. It 
is a bit outdated, but the general purpose of it should be in there. 
Basically, driverfs is a filesystem that maps onto the global device tree. 
Each device found in the system gets a directory in driverfs. In this 
directory, ascii-based files can be created that export device parameters 
(kind of an ascii-based ioctl). 
Files can be created by the bus the device resides on, by a driver that 
binds to the device, or by the class the device registers with. 
In addition to the global device tree, driverfs now exports a flat listing
of bus types in the system. Each bus type gets a directory, which it is 
free to create interface files in. It also a has a devices directory and a 
drivers directory. The former has symlinks for all the devices found on 
that bus type that point to each device's directory in the physical 
hierarchical layout. The drivers directory contains a directory for each 
driver for that bus type. In those directories, drivers may create files 
to export driver-specific parameters (that control the entire driver, not 
an individual device).
