What we really want is a write-often variable in a cacheline combined with 
infrequently read and write data. However, data that is frequently read 
(that is __read_mostly) would still need to be in a separate section.

I think we would want to group write-often variables with infrequently 
used variable. But how does one convince the linker to doing that?
I agree that there is a problem with shift frequently written variables 
together which may in itself cause ill effects. So __read_mostly should 
only be used when we have identified real cacheline sharing problems and 
real cache hot variables may have to be put in a separate cacheline for 
itself. I think we already do that and that is at least the way I have 
handled it. Too many __read_mostly kill the whole point of the exercise.
