90% of drivers contain code written by people who do driver development in
their spare time, with limited resources, most of the time serving as a
learning excercise. And they do this freely and for fun. Accusing them of
being 'stupid gits' is just micharacterising the situation. People do not
get born as VFS hackers, there is a very steep learning curve, and only a
few make it to to have knowledge like you. Much of the learning curve of
various people has traces in drivers/*, it's more like the history of
Linux then some coherent image of people's capabilities.
