Well, the kernel itself doesn't actually disable/enable anything, it 
leaves that decision to the caller. 
XFree86 obviously does have IO rights, and I suspect it may allow the 
video BIOS to do just about anything, simply because it doesn't have much 
choise (the video bios clearly needs a lot of IO privileges too). So yes, 
that could easily confuse the OS if it happens, but it should be 
independent of IO-APIC vs not.
