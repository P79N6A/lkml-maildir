Sure enough, Iafterenabling PIIX support I was able to boot successfully. 
I had left it out because my understanding was that it doesn't support
my chipset... this was incorrect, at least in the case of 2.5.x.  Also,
my 2.4.21 kernel was perfectly happy with PIIX disabled.

requirements?  My approach was to start with a working 2.4.x config,
and enable everything which appeared to be necessary.
Thanx!
