I dearly *hope* this is what I'm seeing with recent kernels, though I
have my doubts....  What I *do* know is that with recent bk snapshots
(post bk-1.2115) I have the following:  radeonfb seems to load, but when I
try to load X, my y-resolution seems to be half of what it ought to be...
The only code I see poking around at fb is yours...  *shrug*
-Happy to try new patches David
