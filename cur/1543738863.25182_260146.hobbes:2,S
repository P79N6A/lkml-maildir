How is this going to interact with SELinux?  Currently SELinux uses
/proc/*/attr/current to report the current security context of the
process.  libselinux expects the file to contain one string (not even a
newline) which is the textual representation of the context.  Now with
your changes you want to change this.  libselinux as-is would break
miserably.
I don't know the history of the file and who is hijacking the file.
Fact is that the file content is currently unstructured and libselinux
couldn't possibly determine what part is of interest to itself.
So, either you use another file, SELinux uses another file, or the file
gets tagged lines like
  selinux: user_u:user_r:user_t
I guess you couldn't even start the userlevel code in FC3 in such a jail
in the moment since the libselinux startup tests would fail.
