Such a patch is in Andrew's tree.
2.6.24-rc6-mm1:
tatic struct kmem_cache_node *early_kmem_cache_node_alloc(gfp_t gfpflags,
                                                           int node)

        struct page *page;
        struct kmem_cache_node *n;
        unsigned long flags;
...
    /*

         * so even though there cannot be a race this early in

         */
        local_irq_save(flags);
        add_partial(kmalloc_caches, page, 0);
        local_irq_restore(flags);
