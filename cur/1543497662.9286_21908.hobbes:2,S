scatter/gather DMA does this quite nicely (need to design a device

granted - but this is not a copy, it is just referencing memory

maybe a packet ring interface would be useful...

prefer DMA, let CPU do something useful

once again, get support for cards that do this - otherwise
do it below the device layer.

this is error recovery - not the fast path to begin with.

once again, not fast path- but you could easily see allocating a couple
of extra buffers (prefetching concepts)

slightly tricky, some DMA playfullness can make this not so bad.

i slightly disagree, i think an architecture needs to be setup so
that a device layer can be used for acceleration, if the card can
assist in the functionality, then let it - otherwise have the fallback
of doing it in software.
