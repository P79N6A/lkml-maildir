Sorry to say this, but it just gives me more hangs ;).
Without pte_fast and your patch, I can run gl apps, and even strace gears
(I was trying to know why it takes 4 seconds to show the first image onto
the gl window, and other 4 betwwen a Ctrl-C and the app really dying...)
With both, gl apps lock the box, and strace gears segfaults after a big
mprotect...
Thanks anyways.
