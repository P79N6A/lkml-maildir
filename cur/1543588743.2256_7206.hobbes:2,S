Well, take that back, I just got it to hang.  Again, this is 2.4.4pre3
with alpha-numa-3 and rwsem-generic-4.  I saw it upon starting mozilla.
I also saw some scary filesystem errors that may or may not be related:
    Apr 23 18:09:40 draal kernel: EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,2)): 
        ext2_new_block: Free blocks count corrupted for block group 252 
There has been a lot of discussion on the topic of rwsems (that,
admittedly, I haven't followed very closely).  It looks like
rwsem-generic-6 is the latest from Andrea, I'll build a new 2.4.4pre4
kernel with these patches and let you know the results.  Have you made
changes between rwsem-generic-4 and rwsem-generic-6 that would
fix/prevent a deadlock?
Let me know if there are any useful tests I could perform.  Would it be
useful for me to run the rwsem benchmarks you've been using?  Could
these detect a deadlock situation?
Cheers,
