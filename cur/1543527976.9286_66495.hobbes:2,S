Hi guys,
I am curious about the current state of play with respect to the bzImage
size limitation (answers like use EFI don't count because until
implementations exist it is just a very nice set of slides and papers).
I am interested in anything ranging from some hacks to raise the limit a
bit to fully-featured protected mode ELF kernel image loaders, if anyone
is working on anything like that?
I am talking about IA32 only here, obviously.
Regards,
