I've been running 2.20.3.1 + the data corruption bug fix on megaraids 
ranging from low-end SATA adapters to the u320scsi ones for a while on a 
2.6.8 based kernel, nothing have blown up yet. The old 2.20.3.1 without 
the fix have been holding up too though - however having a known data 
corruption bug lingering doesn't feel so good :-)
