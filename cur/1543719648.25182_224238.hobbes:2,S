well, most drivers need more or less the similar procedure like
pci_default_suspend/resume(): enable/disable the pci device, toggle
busmastering, and store/restore the pci status. 
if default callbacks are exported, the driver callbacks can be
simplified, such as
int xxx_suspend(struct pci_dev *dev, u32 state)
{
	// ... do h/w specific things
	return pci_default_suspend(dev, state);
}
int xxx_resume(struct pci_dev *dev)
{
	int err;
	if ((err = pci_default_resume(dev)) < 0)
		return err;
	// ... do h/w specific
}
but IMO, the jobs of pci_default_suspend/resume() should be applied
always after/before calling driver's suspend/resume callbacks.
can they break anything potentially?
