And you are excused this once only to have only read what people have
quoted instead of reading what I actually wrote:
   OTOH, drepper@redhat.com might get pressed into not doing incompatible
   changes, although I trust drepper to act truely honest.

Well, the glibc-2.1 on redhat disks acted differently than the glibc-2.1
in the cvs repository or on the ftp servers, but that does not mean that
the actual glibc code is the culprit. Again, please read what I actually
wrote, not only the parts that others have quoted.
Thank you for doing that.

Probably that's becausde I didn't write what you think I did write since
you only read selected snippets of my mail.
