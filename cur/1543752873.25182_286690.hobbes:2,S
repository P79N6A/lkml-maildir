: dead?

I also have an inresponsive keyboard and mouse on my laptop with later kernels.
To qualify that more, the same setup used to compile 2.6.10, 2.6.10-mm2,
2.6.10-mm3, 2.6.11-rc1 only gives me a working keyboard and mouse on the
2.6.10 kernel.  I can plug in a USB keyboard and mouse and they work fine.
Not sure if it's the same problem as the original author.  I just compiled
2.6.11-rc1 with the ps/2 mouse as a module (hoping that forcing it to load
later would help) but that didn't seem to make a difference even though it
looks like the mouse was loaded (by hotplug) after the keyboard should have
been setup.  If you want I'll try another in a few minutes without the
mouse entirely.  It looks like acpi does detect both keyboard and mouse
controllers.  For those interested kernel bootup messages and kernel config
are available here
