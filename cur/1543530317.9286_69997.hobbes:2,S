did that..
it turn out that the filesystem is:
x86 boot sector, system MSDOS5.0, FAT (16 bit)
what I still dont get is why I had to dd if=/dev/sda of=./tempf   rather
than dd if=/dev/sda4 of=./tempf
and now I am able to mount it and run fdisk on it as /dev/sda  but my other
zip disks are /dev/sda4
normal zips disks
mount /dev/sda4 /zip
this zip
mount /dev/sda /zip
any clues on this?
