Or use squid to front apache... this way you can continue to have one url
space, which is a huge bonus.  From experience it is a pain to try to
maintain multiple hostnames (your publishing tools need to all work
properly, your web developers need to not screw it up); and it is
impossible to use multiple ports (some lame firewalls restrict http to
port 80 alone).
A solution like squid lets you build in load balancing, and failover... 
this is one way that folks build big websites using commodity hardware --
use a bunch of small boxes with a proxy in front, and a
fileserver/database behind.  Going to multicpu boxes usually is not worth
it, when you can increase your uptime by adding more boxes. 
(I don't recommend Apache's proxy for this application... I don't
recommend it for anything actually...)
