Welcome to my killfile. There isn't much point having a discussion with
anyone who considers any view or fact not in agreement as "no proof" and
any view or fact that favours them as "proven".
In the meantime perhaps the saner members of the static trace brigade
can explain why gcc debug data isn't good enough for them when its good
enough for kgdb to do single stepping at source level and variable
printing ?
