I hope so. I was just a little surprised when their reply was so
clearly no, without even reacting to my questions about the GPL.
Maybe the support people have no idea, but who else should I contact.

I know and it never looked like they tried to hide the fact they were
using linux. But I have bought other hardware that uses linux based
firmware and they always mentioned it in there manuals even if they
neglected to offer the sources at first. 
There is no mention about the GPL or Linux on their copyrights pages
or anywhere else in the manual. You can find it online on their website:
