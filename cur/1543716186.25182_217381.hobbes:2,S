genrtc.c lacks several features ARM needs, the big one being wakeup
timers.  It also only provides either (configurable) emulation or no
support of various RTC features, rather than allowing a real RTC to
provide them if it can - and you need to know the details of your RTC
at kernel configuration time.
It provides no support for translating "RTC" time into seconds and
vice versa which is needed for second-counter based RTCs found in
PXA, StrongARM, and other ARM SoC platforms.
IOW, its fairly restrictive in what it provides and what it allows
architectures to provide.
