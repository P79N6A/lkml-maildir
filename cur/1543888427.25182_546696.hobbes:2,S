Subject: [PATCH] Fix duplicated entry in Documentation/HOWTO
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/20/28

Commit 3f271008 introduced this section to Linus tree, but a
later commit 722385f7 accepted almost the identical patch via
Greg's tree, both from the same author.
This kills the duplicated one.
Signed-off-by: Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>

-Managing bug reports
---------------------
-
-One of the best ways to put into practice your hacking skills is by fixing
-bugs reported by other people. Not only you will help to make the kernel
-more stable, you'll learn to fix real world problems and you will improve
-your skills, and other developers will be aware of your presence. Fixing
-bugs is one of the best ways to get merits among other developers, because
-not many people like wasting time fixing other people's bugs.
-
-To work in the already reported bug reports, go to 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org
.
-If you want to be advised of the future bug reports, you can subscribe to the
-bugme-new mailing list (only new bug reports are mailed here) or to the
-bugme-janitor mailing list (every change in the bugzilla is mailed here)
