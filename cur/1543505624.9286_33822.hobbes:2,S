Hi,
        On the subject of unmounting /mounting devices, sometimes, I
will mount my floppy(/dev/fd0) and then accidently remove the discfrom
the drive causing the mounted filesystem to be unreadable even when the
disc is re-inserted into the drive. Or in other cases, a filesystem will
be "in use" or "busy" and I just want to force the unmount regardless.
Basically, if umount says "no" how do I force it tosay "yes"?
Thanx
