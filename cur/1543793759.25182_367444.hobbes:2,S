You yourself called it a hack not long ago. I'm not sure why you think
the userspace is the right place for suspending. It seems to me that the
very fact that it requires access to structures that are normally only
visible to the kernel is pretty telling. To be fair, it is true at the
same time that graphical interfaces don't belong in the kernel - but the
vast majority of it - calculating what to write and doing the writing
does. It's only by hamstringing himself and the user - limiting the
image to half of memory that Pavel (and dropping support for writing to
swap) that Pavel can make this work.

I know that Pavel and I have such different ideas about what should be
done that it's not worth the effort.
