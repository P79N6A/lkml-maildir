Subject: [0/3] Improve generic fls64 for 64-bit machines
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/15/66

This series of patches:
[1/3] adds __fls.h to asm-generic
[2/3] modifies asm-*/bitops.h for 64-bit archs to implement __fls
[3/3] modifies asm-generic/fls64.h to make use of __fls
I have compiled i386 and x86_64, and they generate the same code as
before the change. The changes to the other archs are a best effort.
Please comment.
If this patch series is accepted, it will make one tiny bit of
the x86-unification a tiny bit cleaner. The patches are against
Linus' current tree.
Andrew, if no concensus can be reached that this is a bad patch
series, would you be willing to add this to your tree?
Greetings,
