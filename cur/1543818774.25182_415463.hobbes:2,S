Subject: [PATCH] Doc; vm/hugetlbpage update-2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/12/146

From: Randy Dunlap <rdunlap@xenotime.net>
Add new line of /proc/meminfo output.
Explain the HugePage_ lines in /proc/meminfo (from Bill Irwin).
Change KB to kB since the latter is what is used in the kernel.

+HugePages_Total is the size of the pool of hugepages.
+HugePages_Free is the number of hugepages in the pool that are not yet
+allocated.
+HugePages_Rsvd is short for "reserved," and is the number of hugepages
+for which a commitment to allocate from the pool has been made, but no
+allocation has yet been made. It's vaguely analogous to overcommit.
 
 /proc/filesystems should also show a filesystem of type "hugetlbfs" configured
 in the kernel.
