No reproducible problems, just more random oopses (like in

Others have suggested this by mail also, and after running memtest for 4 hours, 
what do you know, a bit error occured.
Test#: 4
Pass#: 6
Failing address: 0aed1f64 - 174.8mb
Good pattern: 00080000
Bad pattern:  000a0000
Error bits:   00020000
Count: 1
I'm pretty sure that 256mb no-brand memory chip I added one year ago is to blame.
I'll try running memtest86 for 8+ hours as soon as feasible, but I guess I 
should just throw out the old RAM and put in some new.
I guess all I have to say is, sorry for wasting your time! :(
Anyway, thanks for your interest - at least I'm close to a solution now! :)
