Syntax highlighting, OK.
Kind of funny thing with it. One for shell in `mcedit` is much nicer, but
`emacs` is more powerful as editor(R). But both have highlighting
problems with non trivial scripts (quoiting, data here, etc). I don't
know if it will ever be fixed :).
Comprehensive highlighting of contents of diffs (or even _patched_
sources) is XXII century feature.
Anyway if anybody have anything to look onto, like more Linux C types,
bogus coding style highlighting, i'll be glad to test. And any
emacs hacks, that gurus are using will be very appreciated.

Emacs have black background by default. I changed foreground to green,
and it is much nicer for long runs. Blue (or any bright) background
isn't comfortable, i think.

Black background mostly. If you know classic blackbox wm (version <=
0.62), then Rancor(80%) and Artwiz(20%) my all time styles. But i use
no X for quite some time now.
