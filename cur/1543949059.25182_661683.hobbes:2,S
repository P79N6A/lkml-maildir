The problem isn't that of supporting the naive user xattr model: we can
almost do that within the existing 'named attribute' model of NFSv4. The
problem is that of supporting the arbitrary "security metadata" that are
allowed to have side-effects on the system behaviour, and that we appear
to have thought was a good idea to overload onto the xattr interface.
In the case of maclabels, where the "side-effect" is to describe and
enable extra access control rules, then you have the potential for
setting people up with a major interoperability problem. Using a
dedicated interface for it instead of overloading a Linux-style xattr
interface allows you to limit the scope of the documentation problem
that you would otherwise have.
