Yes you should be able to mix 16x50 chips with sa1100 chips. That is not the
issue. I believe that people can place any mixture of IC's on a PCB.

That may help others but it is still not the issue.

We have thought of the above solutions and I believe that Erik Mouw has a
one line fix that will make everybody happy about the serial port. IMHO, the
current problem is that Russell gets too angry to talk about this issue. I
believe that no problem can be solved with a flame war going on. That is why
I decide to stop speaking with him about the serial port issue. He then
decided to block the e-mails. So here we are.
Best Regards,
