[snip]
Gerd's original patch had
	struct dvb_pll_desc {
		char *name;
		u32  min;
		u32  max;
		void (*setbw)(u8 *buf, int bandwidth);
		int  count;
		struct {
			u32 limit;
			u32 offset;
			u32 stepsize;
			u8  cb1;
			u8  cb2;
		} entries[];
	};
while 2.6.11-mm3 changed it into entries[0]. I assume this was made
for gcc-4.0 compatibility? But the element type for entries is
fully defined, so it should not be a problem (as long as no one tries to
created arrays of struct dvb_pll_desc)?
