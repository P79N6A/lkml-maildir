Admittedly, I don't think SMP ARM has been around all that long? Maybe
the existing code just has not been extended.

I'm not sure on this. It's going to be NULL for other architectures, or
end up being called by the reprogram() call for the last CPU to go idle,
right (presuming there isn't a separate TOD source, like in x86). I
think it is better to be in the reprogram() interface.

This might just be tied to the same UP capabilities, I'm not sure.

I agree; the latter can be in the arch-specific reprogram() code, just
like arch_all_cpus_idle() (which might be better named to
arch_set_all_cpus_idle()).

I definitely appreciate you doing so; dyn-tick for x86 has clearly come
a long way in a short time.

I'll take a look at this.

Couldn't that be part of the s390-specific init() code? That member is
non-existent in the ARM implementation either, but it should not be hard
to add? The only issue I see, though, is that the function which the
init() member points to should not be marked __init, as we could have an
empty pointer later on?

I'm not sure on this last one, though, what part of the state can't
simply be represented by an integer with appropriate &-ing?
Thanks,
