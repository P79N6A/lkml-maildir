I've tried to compile kernel version 2.4.17 with static dfme support,
but ld fails to link. Here is the error I get:
drivers/net/net.o(.data+0x434): undefined reference to `local symbols \
      in discarded section .text.exit'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
Setting dfme as module is ok. Same problem with 2.4.16-pre1; I've found
references about a dfme problem in 2.4.7 kernel, but nothing for new
ones.
I've used gcc 2.95.4 and ld version 2.11.92.0.12.3.
