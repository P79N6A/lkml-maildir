I would just say that this could be seen rather as a driver tracing
interface than a general purpose tracing interface. Therefore, maybe the
name is a bit misleading ? And yes, what is there is good, but it does
not seem to be a replacement for a generic kernel tracer.
My suggestions to turn it into a more suitable interface for a generic
tracer are summarized in this email:
