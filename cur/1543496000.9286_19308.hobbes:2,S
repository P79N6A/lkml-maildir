99.99% of the time, a symbol starting with HAVE_ is defined by some
configuration tool.  Sometimes it is in the Makefile, more often it is
generated when you run ./configure in the top level source directory.
It has nothing to do with the kernel and everything to do with testing
what your run time user space libraries support.  Try "info autoconf".
