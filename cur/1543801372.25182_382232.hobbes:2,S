What nvidia version number is that? I remember it being over 5 megs in size. Oh
BTW, that's one GOOD REASON for me to believe having certain parts in userspace
(e.g. X was mentioned) being a good thing - after all, you can't swap kernel
memory. If nvidia continued like that, their kernel module would eventually
exceed the amount of RAM that is apparently installed.
