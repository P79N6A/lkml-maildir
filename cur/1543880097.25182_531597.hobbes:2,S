Well, that was totally useless answer from the ZFS developers.  What
he should have told you is to contact Sun management, since they are
the only ones who can decide whether or not to release ZFS under a GPL
license, and more importantly, to give a patent license for any
patents they may have filed in the course of developing ZFS.  This is
not anything Linux developers can help you with.
