NO!!!! No more huge patch bombs to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
people!  Condense your changes into more manageable pieces
or only submit smaller groups of changes at a time.
You people doing this are absolutely killing vger.kernel.org.
Every patch you post has to go to 5000+ subscribers, so please
keep this in mind when posting multiple patches.  If you feel
the need to send, say, more than 15 patches at once, reconsider.
