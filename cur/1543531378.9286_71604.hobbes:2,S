I've just been sitting on that, because after I wrote it, no one
(including the people who paid me to write it!) seemed interested in
using it.  And the company that paid me for it never got around to
sending me the prototype hardware, so it is completely untested.
If someone wants to look at it / test it / port it to 2.3, I'll send
it to them.  But I don't really want to spend more time on it if there
is no evidence that it will ever be used.
The SC400 emulates an ordinary i82365 socket controller, I think; it
is only the SC300 that has an oddball controller.
