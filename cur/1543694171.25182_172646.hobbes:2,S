If you do automated testing of nightly builds of the mainline 2.6 / 2.7
kernels, and point out when they get bigger in consumption, you'll have
a much better chance of convincing people to fix it when the patch in
question is still topical, and fresh in people's minds.
I'd predict that a lot of the issue is just tuning things dynamically 
instead of statically sizing them.
