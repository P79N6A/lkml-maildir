Agreed. I wonder how you can best illustrate the theoretical machine
model (from a programmer's point of view). I guess each consistency
domain has an horizon (barrier, but I'm trying to avoid that word in
this context) over which memory barriers will provide some partial
ordering on transactions going to and/or from the horizon.

I guess you could think of a smp_wmb() in this case being a wall that
moves out from the CPU along with other memory stores, and stops them
from passing (the problem with a "wall" is that it doesn't easily apply
to a full smp_mb() unless you have loads travelling the same way, which
has its own intuitiveness problems).

Yeah that would be nice. The abstract explanation will be tricky. Maybe
it isn't so critical to be easily understandable if it is backed by
examples.
