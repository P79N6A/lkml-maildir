I got the same thing in my computer. 
Maybe this can reproduce it.
 1: add this in boot loader 
    "init=/bin/sh"
 2: after system boot, then active swap space, then do suspend.
 3: after system resume, the sh will crash like. 
    that can 100% reproduce it my in X86, X86_64, PPC32.
The Software suspend2 has not that problem.
