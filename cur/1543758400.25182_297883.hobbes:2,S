Subject: [patch 3/2] drivers/char/vt.c: remove unnecessary code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We could change an affectation into an incrementation by this patch, and,
so far I know, incrementing is quicker than or as quick as setting
a variable (depends on the architecture).
Please _don't_ apply this, but tell me what you think about it.
Note that npar is unsigned.
