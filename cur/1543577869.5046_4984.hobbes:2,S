Right.  There are two distinct meanings:
1) Do not write to this medium, ever (physical readonly); and
2) Do not allow modifications to the filesystem (logical readonly).
The fact is that the kernel confuses the two, but that just isn't
always legitimate.  Filesystems may want to do things like garbage
collection or defragmentation in the background even when there is no
appplication write activity.
We just don't have a way of specifying these two things independently.
A journaled filesystem can only be dirty if it was in the middle of
write activity, so mounting an unclean filesystem physically readonly
is not much different from suddenly making the underlying media
readonly during active service: of _course_ the filesystem is going to
get upset!

You don't have to: it is theoretically possible to scan the journal
and create a mapping from physical blocks on the rest of the
filesystem to journal entries.  The filesystem can then read from the
log whenever a replayable block is accessed.
However, this imposes a lookup cost on all accesses in the filesystem
even when we aren't in this virtual translating mode, so it's not a
cost I'd want to add unnecessarily.
The bottom line is that journaling and recovery both require write
access for now.  I might implement an emergency readonly mount mode,
but I'm not going to make it particularly streamlined at the cost of
slowing down normal mounts.
Cheers,
 Stephen
