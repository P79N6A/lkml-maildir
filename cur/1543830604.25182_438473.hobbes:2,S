My impression is as follows.  The OpenVz implementation and mine work
on the same basic principles of handling the network stack at layer 2.
We have our implementation differences but the core ideas are about the
same.
Daniels patch still had elements of layer 3 handling as I recall
and that has problems.

Besides laying the foundations.  The current conversation seems to be
about understanding the implications of the network stack when
we implement a network namespace.
There is a lot to the networking stack so it takes a while.
In addition this is one part of the problem that everyone has implemented,
so we have several more opinions on how it should be done and what
needs to happen.
