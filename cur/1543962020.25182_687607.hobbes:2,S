I noticed that arch/x86/kernel/acpi/realmode/wakeup.lds was being remade on
every make.  A run with V=2 nicely told me why.  I did what it told me:
--- a/arch/x86/kernel/acpi/realmode/Makefile
+++ b/arch/x86/kernel/acpi/realmode/Makefile
@@ -6,7 +6,7 @@
 # for more details.

-targets		:= wakeup.bin wakeup.elf
+targets		:= wakeup.bin wakeup.elf wakeup.lds
 
 wakeup-y	+= wakeup.o wakemain.o video-mode.o copy.o
 
That made it no longer rebuild that stuff every time.
But now it says:
make[5]: `arch/x86/kernel/acpi/realmode/wakeup.bin' is up to date.
  LD      vmlinux.o - due to: init/built-in.o
and still relinks the kernel on every make run.  
Can you figure it out, please?  "make; make" should not relink.
Thanks,
Roland
