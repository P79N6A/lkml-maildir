What is happening that takes 3ms, and why can't it be broken up?
Are you talking here about PIO?  Is there a limited amount of time you 
have to do the PIO before the data goes away?  It may be acceptable to 
just live with PIO being slow, since high-performance systems will all 
be using DMA anyhow.

In this case, I mean extremely harsh and restrictive.  Usually, it means 
"excessively harsh", but in this case, I mean that in a good way.  :)
