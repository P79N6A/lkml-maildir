Unfortunately it does completely the wrong thing if you have more than
one disk: it stalls all writes on all disks as soon as any one disk goes
into wait-on-read.  That's not good.  Not good at all.
This is precisely the problem with optimising for one micro-benchmark.
We really do need per-block-device IO scheduling, in some form or
another, to fix this once and for all.  We already have the per-device
CURRENT queues, so some of the necessary infrastructure is in place
today (and the current mechanism does support devices specifying their
own queues to let them share queues sensibly).
