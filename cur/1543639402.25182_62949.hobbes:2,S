Remind me why we'd want this in the kernel source tree when we don't even
have modutils there? Or a real bootloader? There is no requirement that
the kernel must be able to build a bootable image with ip autoconf and
nfsroot, etc. without using external tools. A minimal 'parse command line
to mount root and call real init' might be nice, but mostly as an
example, like the example watchdog code.
I think a better way to go is to simply roll an initbootutils.tar.gz,
point to it in the kernel CHANGES, etc., start pulling stuff into it, and
people will catch on in no time.
