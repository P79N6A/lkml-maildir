Hmmm,
I didn't know you worked in Boca Raton for Don Estrage on
the IBM 5150. I must have missed you --somehow.
[Snipped...]
You do remember that the X86 can do back-to-back port
instructions faster than the ISA bus capacity can be
charged, don't you? You do remember the admonishment
about:
 	intel asm
 	mov	dx, port	; One of two adjacent ports
 	mov	al,ffh		; All bits set
 	out	dx,al		; Output to port, bits start charging bus
 	inc	al		; Al becomes 0
 	inc	dx		; Next port
 	out	dx,al		; Write 0 there, data bits discharged
When the port at 'port' gets its data, it will likely
be 0, not 0xff, because the intervening instructions
can execute faster than a heavily-loaded ISA bus.
So, with a true ISA/EISA bus, not an emulated one off
a bridge, you have to worry about this. In the IBM/PC
BIOS listing, supplied with every early real PC, it
was called "bus settle time." Remember? If not, you
never wrote code for that platform.
