This is true, but it looks like the brw_kiovec allocation failure
handling is broken already; it's calling __put_unused_buffer_head on
bhs without waiting for them to complete first.  Also, the err won't
be returned if the previous batch of bhs finished ok.  It looks like
brw_kiovec needs some work, but I'm going to need some coffee first...
