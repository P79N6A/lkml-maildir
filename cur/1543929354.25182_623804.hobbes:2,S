| It didn't help.  The original oops says the problem was in strcmp.  It
| was a GPF, which suggests to me that one of the arguments is NULL. 
| Since ops->name is checked at the beginning of the function, the only
| other possibility is that alg->ops->name is NULL.  I added a bit of code
| to check for this, and it turns out that one of the strings was indeed
| NULL.  I didn't know where to go from there in debugging, but I hope it
| helps.

Hi Thomas,
could you please try that one ;)
Ayway as my previous patch and this one have to be applied anyway (regardless
the OOPs you catched). So I've sent previous patch to list and this one too,
but that is more important for - does these (both) patch helped. Thanks a lot
for patience (i know the problem is in strcmp but it seems that is a side issue -
main problems seems to be in sych. events)

Subject: [PATCH] [PATCH] NET: mac80211 - fix inappropriate memory freeing
This patch does fix inappropriate memory freeing in case
of requested rate_control_ops was not found. In this case
the list head entity is going to be accidently wasted.
