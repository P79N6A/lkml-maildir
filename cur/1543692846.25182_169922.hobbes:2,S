Ya, OK. I understand. It is really acquired to reproduce this, when
possible, with an untainted kernel... Otherwise it is not possible to
work, you really do not know what this _huge_ module does...
I updated to 2.6.0-test6-mm1 yesterday, which lifes still after day
change :) and when this freezes I will get rid of the nvidia module to
reproduce that with the nv driver (problem is, only one monitor then!)
and only then I will report.
Really, I only wanted to know if a day change can trigger a kernel
freeze, but, I realize now, one does not know what goes on with that:
nvidia               1709612  10
o_O
