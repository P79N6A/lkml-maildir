Now read the code carefully and see how allocations can
end up here ... and when they can't...

Wrong. Getblk won't deadlock, it will just sleep and another
thread will continue later on. Killing processes will (in 2.4)
only happen when you run out of swap ... 2.4 will simply have
its processes loop in alloc_pages() until memory is available.
The "maybe damages its structures" is a sure indication of
you having a very vivid imagination ;)

Umm?  Can you explain how this could happen?

We have something a little bit like this in 2.4, though
it's just a printk and it doesn't print a backtrace. Now
that you mention it, though, printing a backtrace may be
a nice debugging option for missed higher-order allocations ;)
(but only useful if you get unreasonable amounts of them)
