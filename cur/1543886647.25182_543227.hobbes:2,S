Hi,
The following series of patches is a replacement of the freezer patches
recently dropped by Linus.
Each of the first six patches fixes specific issue related to the freezer, as
explained in the changelogs and in the comments within the patches.  The
last patch is a cleanup.
Please consider them for merging.
Greetings,
Rafael
