Yes, zeroing and casts would work for the kernel (zeroing in order to
avoid garbage from confusing user space if we don't use the entire
fixed-size field), along with the right alignment, and the user space
could just do a memcmp-equivalent that's optimized this type of object.
Still looks a bit clumsy to me when compared to the sheer elegance of
an assignment and "normal" operations, but maybe that's just a
question of perception.
Yep, sounds okay. Let's go for this approach then.
Thanks,
