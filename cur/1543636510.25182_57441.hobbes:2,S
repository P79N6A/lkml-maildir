Matt,
Thanks for the reply. First, let me say thank you very much for a super web
site that helped us sort out issues with the 2650 RAID stuff.
I'm not familiar with the HyperThreading concept.
Do you know of any docs that discuss this.  I'm particularly concerned with
how this impacts the results of monitoring tools such as top.
Thanks,
Bob

Congratulations, you purchased a fine PowerEdge 2650 with processors which
contain HyperThreading technology.  Each physical processor appears as two
logical processors.  This behaviour is expected, and correct. :-)
Thanks,
Matt
