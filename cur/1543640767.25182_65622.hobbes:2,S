You certainly have much more insight into the problem than I. 
I wonder if (something like) the simple patch I submitted before can
be a temporary solution nevertheless. Please correct me if one of the
following statements is wrong:
1) The "4 byte shift" issue does not affect the CSB5 series.
2) The tested condition inb(dma_base+0x02)&1 is valid if the
   device doing the DMA reported an error status. Only if the
   device reports success is there an indication of the "4 byte shift".
3) The "4 byte shift" problem matters not for read-only devices like
   CD-ROMS; at least it is no reason to stall the computer if it occurs
   because data corruption is not an issue.
If these assertions are true, the patch I sent will at least prevent
people's machines from stalling unnecessarily. Even if one ore more are
false, the remaining correct condition test(s) will narrow the set
of machines that are stalled unnecessarily.

You sure have to go for the right solution.
But if my patch was applied, ServerWorks chip sets would cause less
grief to people until you have figured it out.

Let me know if we can help. I have no personal contacts to ServerWorks,
but we are a large customer of them and may be able to exert some
additional pressure. The current situation (IDE DMA must be disabled)
is hardly acceptable for us anyway.
