Hi,
Please note I am not on the Kernel mailing list, so please be so kind
as to copy me in on any reply made.
I am trying to send this posting again in hopes it will be received
by the mailing list this time.  Also note the previously noted files
attached are now contained in one archive called
"UnresolvedSymbols.tar.bz2".  Not sure if those files or the
associated size had anything to do with the prior posting attempts
being rejected my the mailing list system.
Regards,

Hello,
First I am not on the Kernel mailing list so please copy me in on any
replies.
Second,. although I encountered this error using an -AC patch, I have
seen this problem in past with the Linux based kernels.  Seeing as
this was my most recent 2.4.8 Kernel compile attempt I thought I use
this as the example.
I I downloaded the 2.4.8 Linus kernel and applied the -AC10 patch
successfully.  Using the attached .config file
"Kernel.config-2.4.8-ac10-20010824" I did a "make xconfig", "make
dep"
and them a "make bzImage modules modules_install".  It appears not
all
the modules were installed and likely a result of the various
"Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.8 ..." errors I received. The
console messages for this are in the
"Kernel-2.4.8-ac10-CompileMessages-20010824.txt" file.  The errors
are
at the end of the "Kernel-2.4.8-ac10-CompileMessages-20010824.txt"
file, but I included all the console messages I received in event
some
prior message may have a bearing on the issue.
Any thoughts and feedback on this would be most greatly appreciated.

John L. Males
