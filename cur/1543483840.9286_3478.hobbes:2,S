Subject: strange NFS problem with 2.2.1 !!

Some minutes ago I cp-ed a file to our server via NFS fs exported from the
server hal2000 (2.2.1up, user space NFS server, client is 2.2.1up too)
And I tried to execute but :
lgb@hal2000:~$ ./hexedit
bash: ./hexedit: Text file busy
lgb@hal2000:~$ fuser -vm ./x11amp
                     USER       PID ACCESS COMMAND
./x11amp             lgb       8023 ..c..  bash
lgb@hal2000:~$ echo $$
8023
lgb@hal2000:~$
Any idea ? Why blocks my shell on server x11amp when I copy with a shell
on ANOTHER machine through NFS ? Strange, I think.
