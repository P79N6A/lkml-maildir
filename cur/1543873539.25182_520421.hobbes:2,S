With more CPUs, the context switch period can be multiplied by that
number of CPUs while still allowing all tasks the same frequency of
access to the CPU. With 4 processors, the context switch would be
24ms, by which point we're probably reaching the point of diminishing
returns for minimizing overhead and maximizing throughput.

That's a judgement call. If a synthetic benchmark degrades but other
things improve, then this, as most everything in computer science, is
yet another trade-off that needs to be evaluated. (You recognize there
is a tradeoff here, right? Some benchmarks would improve even further
if the switch time were 500ms. But that would make the system nearly
unusable in general.)
