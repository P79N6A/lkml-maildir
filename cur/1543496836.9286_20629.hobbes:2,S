To rephrase that, the whole thing basically reduces to making the RTC
appear to be storing UTC even if it isn't really doing so.

Given the said patch, all userspace programs can safely assume that
the RTC is storing UTC time at all times.

My patch as so far presented only deals with the READ half of the
equation. A complete patch would also need to deal with the WRITE half
thereof as well, and thereby provide a consistant view of the RTC to
userland irrespective of what's actually in it.

It IS intended to be a boot parameter, but that parameter needs to
have a DEFAULT value, and what better default than the timezone offset
for the place where the kernel is compiled.

As far as distribution kernels for people like RedHat, Caldera and the
like are concerned, I would assume that they will compile kernels set
to default to RTC = UTC, and have their install scripts set the
correct timezone parameter for the installation. Any other setting is
meaningless in that context.

The problem there is the race that's involved. Basically, hwclock
needs to refer to a file on disk that it can't refer to until the
relevant partition has been mounted, and the relevant partition can't
be mounted until it's been fsck'd, which can't safely happen until
after hwclock's been run...
The cure for this vicious circle is to have some means for the kernel
to get an idea of the correct time BEFORE any of those need to run,
hence the proposed patch...

Given the patch I proposed, this becomes a non-issue, since the offset
is then calculated as part of the "read CMOS" step, so stage (2) has
no calculation to do, and stage 4's "read CMOS" step inherently
applies the correct offset.

That's basically what my patch does...
