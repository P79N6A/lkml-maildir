Thanks for the descriptive lesson! But this explanation is displaced HERE.
It should be part of the Kconfig text instead, as the b44 running on an 
OpenWRT embedded device simply does not show up in Kernel configuration of 
2.6.21.2 and earlier kernels.
In so far there is a bug that I would call superficial and incomplete 
explanation of b44 features in Kconfig!
Just two or three explaining sentences at the appropriate place would do well 
instead of singing this aria again an again:
"It simply shows again that you don't know how b44, ssb or anything related 
works."
It's NOT MY task to be omnicient. Above that, the b44 modules have never been 
documented at all. So how can you expect me and others to know about the 
latest features of version 2? Very strange behaviour of yours ) :

Thanks, now I know. But the dependencies chaos plus the PCI disfunctionality 
stays unfortunately!

NO! See above please and DO NOT IGNORE!

Yes! This sort of mistakes is completely impossible, as I use to work with 
aliases rather than IP adresses. The machine I tried to ping (i. e. my 
router) is called Jerry (as a reminiscence to Mr. "Captan Trips" from 
Grateful Dead), and thus "ping jerry" returned the following:
"destination host unreachable"
Above that, I state for the second time now that I reverted your patches in 
2.6.22-rc2-mm1 with the effect that everything worked perfectly!
Maxi said something at least similar. So how many proofs do you need, Mister 
Buesch, to finally pick up patchworking now?? 
So, the ball has been in your court for two days now, and you simply keep on 
hesitating to take action now. Instead you are playing a 
nonsense "I-am-not-responsible-and-you-don't-know-Ping-Pong game"
ignoring every hint, criticism that you are offered.
REAL GREAT!
> Try it again, please.
NO!

A. I do not know where to download that wireless-dev tree.
B. I do not know how to implement it into mm or mainline
C. I have given enough sophisticated proof that your stuff in mm-tree is 
highly incomplete / buggy.

That consequence I already explained:
But it's a pleasure for me to repeat it once more:
When you are saying Y to "EISA, VLB, PCI and on board controllers"
you simply do get not only completely different interrupts for the b4401 
device, but you get also completely different module dependencies.
If the module dependencies are correct the IRQ number is also correct,
If the module dependencies are broken the IRQ number is also broken.
It's as easy as that simply!
In other words, UTMOST CLEAR:
Runningh a PCI B4401 NIC:
A. If you declare the b4401 device in Kconfig as a non PCI device (well, how 
should you know if there is neither documenatary nor appropriate kconfig 
text) you get a disfunctionable b44 PLUS a BROKEN interrupt number.
B. If you declare the b4401 device in Kconfig as a PCI device you get a 
disfunctionable b44 PLUS a CORRECT interrupt number.
The ball is in your court, Michael.
Instead of playing verbal ping pong you would better send me info about debug 
parameters for ssb AND b44 and tell me what specific log you need afterwards. 
If b44 misses debug printks or dprintks then please send me an appropriate 
patch to apply against the mm-tree.
But, this stuff in the current state IS PROVEN to be highly buggy / 
experimental / incomplete / bad described in Kconfig! It should NEVER be 
pulled into vanilla in the current state!
So, Michael, you got two choices now:
A. Either you offer debug parameters now / and / or appropriate patches OR
B. I will stop answering on that issue with the consequence that your stuff 
will never reach vanilla mainline. For this case I will ask Andrew to throw 
your stuff into the trashcan.
I've wasted enough time on that buggy crap now with output zero. It's enough 
now, Michael!
Cheers
Uwe
Hint: Broadcom 4401 is NOT equal to Broadcom 4401!
I got two nearly identical machines owing that onboard controller.
There in fact has been a buggy / incomplete driver who did well on the one 
machine, but did not work on the other one..... : (
Don't ask me which 2.6 kernel that was, I do not remember. Must have been 
2.6.9 or an earlier one.
