In general, I like these kinds of conversions.  But, in this case, I
think it makes the code harder to read.  Those intermediate variables
are really nice and I think they make the code much more readable.  
Do you really prefer:
       BUG_ON(PFN_DOWN(addr + size) > bdata->node_low_pfn)
over
       BUG_ON(end > bdata->node_low_pfn);
Also, these do a bit more than just conversions to using the pfn/page
macros.  With this much churn, it is more than possible that bugs can
creep in.  How about a bit more restrictive conversion to the PFN_
macros, first?
Oh, and if you're going to chew through it later, feel free to make
things like sidx into decent variable names. ;)
Is everybody else OK with this code churn?  It doesn't appear that there
is too much in -mm pending in this area.
