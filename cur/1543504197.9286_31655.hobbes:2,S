Ioremap'd memory is always uncached on ARM.  But you need to be careful if you 
use this on "real" (ie non-I/O) memory, especially on the EBSA-285 -- ioremap 
adds in the IO_FUDGE_FACTOR and you will need to subtract it out again.
Alternatively you could use __ioremap but that might not buy you very much.
