Try transferring large files via minicom/zmodem (lrzsz).
Do you get CRC errors during transfer (would definitely point to serial
driver then).
Similar problems happen to me on my laptop when using 2.2.x with X server
or 2.4.x with or without. 2.2.x without X is fine, haven't tested 2.6.x
yet. (by the way, no problem with serial mouse, just file transfers which
do not proceed since almost all frames have some errors).
I've also ran serial console with 2.6.x on SMP machine with the laptop as
console (but running 2.4.x). Sometimes the output gets slightly garbled,
could be a problem with flow control too. I can do more experiments if
anyone is interested.
