Subject: SiI3112: problemes with shared interrupt line?

Hi,
we got a machine with a Nforce2 chipset and a SiI3112 SATA controller.
Two Maxtor disks are configured in software raid, level 1. 
The machine is quite stable as long as I keep the raid degraded. If try
to syncronize the array the machines dies within 20 minutes. No message
given.
This has lead med to believe there is a problem with the two drives
sharing interrupt line 11. I guess it is impossible to force ide2 and
ide3 to use different interrupts as both devices are on the same chip.
I am running Linux 2.4.22-ac3.
Has anyone else seen this?
