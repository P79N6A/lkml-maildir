But it's an order-1 allocation, which may not be available due to
fragmentation. Although you might have large amounts of memory free
at a given point, fragmentation can be triggered earlier when free
memory gets very low (because order-0 allocations may have taken up
all of the free order-1 pages).
Increasing it is known to help. Although you shouldn't crash due to
allocation failures... it would be nice if you could connect a serial
or vga console and see what's happening...
