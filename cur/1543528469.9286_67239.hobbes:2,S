Subject: PCI probing in slot order?

It would be nice to have devices compiled into the kernel probe in slot
order, ie.
	slot 1 - video card - fbdev/nothing
	slot 2 - ethernet card - tulip
	slot 3 - 2nd ethernet card - eepro100
However this makes initialization hairy, because you cannot init the
hardware at init_module time.  For new PCI drivers I think this is an
easy problem -- just delay when probe() is called -- but it seems like
the new PCI API will need a bit of reworking before slot order probing
is possible.
