I've been reading/checking up on this the last four hours since I
had a nagging suspicion that the CPU indeed didn't enter a sleep
state. With all the abbreviations in the ACPI field (S1, C1, P1 etc)
it killed a fair amount of brain cells, but I'd still call faul on this:
from /var/log/kernel
[powernow-k8 module loads processor module which says]
ACPI: CPU0 (power states: C1[C1])
and catting /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power gives
active state: C1
max_cstate: C8
bus master activity: 00000000
states:
   *C1: type[C1] promotion[--] demotion[--] latency[000] usage[02998796]
/sys/module/processor/parameters/max_cstate says 8
/sys/module/processor/parameters/bm_history says 4294967295
So I'm a bit baffled that no C2/C3 turns up. I've done a test-compile
with all of ACPI in kernel instead of as modules, but there was no
difference.
I'll unload the whole USB-module part and boot without loading them, but
will it matter? Please provide more details about how to debug this
(very confusing) field.
