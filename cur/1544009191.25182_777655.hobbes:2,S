I have swapped my disks:
Removed my 12 velociraptors.
Inserted my old 12 raptor150s (all ADFD).
The 12 velociraptors are now in a test system using md/raid.
The 12 raptor 150s are now in my main machine w/3ware.
I am going to run the same tests, benchmarks, etc and see if any problems 
repeat with the 150s and I will also run a bunch more tests on the 
velociraptors as well.
So far no problems with the good ol' raptor 150s and I have been running 
the same dd test for the past 8 hours+ on the same raid type and settings 
as I had with the velociraptors:

So far no problems, just like before when I used to use these drives in 
the past, they are rock solid (will continue to test, the VRs are another 
story)-- more info soon to follow.
