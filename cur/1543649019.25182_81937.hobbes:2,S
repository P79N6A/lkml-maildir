I only use mrproper myself. Always have. Over the years I've seen
too many build failures for others caused by insufficient cleaning
to really trust plain clean.

Changing the behaviour of mrproper is like $EDITOR suddenly changing its
core key bindings. Users accustomed to those bindings won't be happy.
If, for whatever reason, clean becomes as powerful as mrproper, just
set mrproper == clean. Or remove clean but keep mrproper :-)
