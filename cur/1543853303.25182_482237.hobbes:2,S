"The VIA VT8237 chipset also support HPET."
And this is confirmed by:

"However, there is no guarantee that the timer actually has 64 bits, the
specification only recommends it.  My x86-64 system has a 32-bit timer
(AMD64 with a VT8237 southbridge). "
Hmm, and I'm afraid I have a VT8235 only which possibly doesn't have HPET :-P
A relatively detailed (covers Windows XP timer details) HPET etc.
x86 timers discussion is at
