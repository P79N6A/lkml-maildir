Given this last statement, why is it that Matt Mackall's suggestion in
the "Light-weight dynamically extended stacks" thread didn't get any
_real_ discussion from the big 4K stack advocates?  For all intents
and purposes, Matt was dismissed with the same Bunk: "Ever since
neilb's patch there are 0 bugs.. blah blah".  4K, 8K (aka "6 kB")
aside; having more stack safety in the Linux kernel is a "good thing"
no?  Aren't dynamic stacks a viable means to imposing 4K (but doing so
with real safety)?
