Subject: AMD PCNET under VMWare with kernel 2.4.2pre3 and 2.4.1-ac10

I installed a fresh Slackware 7.1 with kernel 2.2.16 to do some testing
with the 2.4 kernel series, all this under VMWare.  Everything was fine,
until I installed the new kernel (yes, I installed the stuff required in
the CHANGES file).  I cannot get 2.4.2pre3 or 2.4.1-ac10 to recognize
the AMD PCNET adapter.  Anyone having similar problems?
