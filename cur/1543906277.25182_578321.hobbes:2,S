No, it does not seem to.  Evolution runs OK.  ps, top, pmap all work
fine.
However, a couple of other things happened.  Could be unrelated or only
loosely related.
Evolution launches spamd (spamassassin) to filter junk mail.  spamd died
and I have this in dmesg to show for it:
VM: killing process spamd
spamd would have inherited the libhugetlbfs.so environment variables.
There are no other clues as to why it died though.
Also, immediately after launching evolution with libhugetlbfs, I got
that USB bug where the mouse starts creating keyboard input.  I got some
of these in dmesg:
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 240
That could be pure coincidence, although I had been using the system
almost all day before that, and it hadn't happened.
