If there is any amount of interest in this, I think we have a hack where
we can repeatedly import a CVS repository and make it a BK repository.
So we could track Dave's tree until he realizes the error of his ways
and switchs to the One True Source Management System (tm)  :-)  Did ya
get the :-)
If you want BitMover to do this, let me know.  I sort of need to know
how widespread the interest is, if there is enough, I need to upgrade to
a full T1 line so that I can handle the load.  I have no problem doing
that but right now the partial is working fine and I see no reason to
just throw money away (I reserve that for my woodworking toys :-)
It won't take much, if 50 people say "yeah, that would be enough for
me to play with BK", we'll do it.  If it's 3 people, hey, kick Dave to
make the CVS tree work...
