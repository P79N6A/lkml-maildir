Ignoring the fact that the types are wrong for 64 bit values, you can save
one masking (in all generic_hweight functions in fact) by using the
following expression for the first line:
	uxx res = w - ((w>>1) & 0x55...55);
where xx is 8, 16, 32, or 64 and the right number of 5s.
That's an old trick but I can't remember the reference nor
where I found the reference to it, sorry.
