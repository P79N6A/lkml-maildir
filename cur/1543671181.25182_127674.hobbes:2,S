Please, somebody answer this question.  The good folks at Transmeta
should know the answer.
I'm really intersted as I want to do exactly this eventually.
Perhaps the constraints are different when software binary translation
is used?  I.e. I could sell a non-x86 cpu and give away an x86
translator without needing a license from Intel, presumably?
