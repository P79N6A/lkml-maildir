   i fsck'd the partition, it came up clean
Did it actually do an check the partition, or did it exit almost
immediately saying the filesystem was clean, so it didn't need to do a
check.  You need to run e2fsck -f to force a filesystem check regardless
of status of the "clean bit" in the superblock.
