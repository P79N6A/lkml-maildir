I disagree. Changing the type of a variable is a significant
modification. If someone does that, he or she *must* check every
use of that variable, at which point he or she will also modify
any range checks accordingly. Having checks that don't fit with
the previous type *distracts* from that job. "Oh, did I modify
that part already? Guess I can skip checking the rest of that
function then." Oops.
Nor is readability a suitable argument. Checking if hdr.cmd is
less than zero gives the misleading impression that it *could*
be less than zero, thus *impairing* readability.
