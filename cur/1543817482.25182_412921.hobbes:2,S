Hmm... I think we had this issue already even with today's 2**31 ext3.
Since ext2/3 always use percpu_counter_read_positive() to get the total
number of free blocks, so if the real free blocks is 0x0fff_feee, and
the approximate value from the percpu counter is 0xf000_0123, the
percpu_counter_read_positive() will return back 0x0000123.

Sounds like the simple solution so far.
