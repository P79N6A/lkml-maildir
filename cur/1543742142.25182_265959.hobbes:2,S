Hi,
Is anyone aware of kernel call which allows a test
tool developer to have exclusive access to PCI adapter
hardware. By exclusive access I mean both
driver as well as kernel should not touch hardware. 
I have been using driver's remove call to simulate the
situation as if adapter has been hot plugged out. And
once my testing is done I call driver's probe
call to put adapter back. But this seems to create a
problem when somehow kernel calls driver's remove
call.
Also If I dont call probe for the removed adapter, on
next reboot machine hangs !
Any information/suggestions please .....
Thanks in advance.
best regards,
Mehul.
