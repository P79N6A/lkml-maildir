vm_force_exec32 and friends were still alive on 2.6.9 release, but now (and in
2.6.10) they seem deleted.
I've not compile-tested this, but it seems correct. Below some history of why
I guess they were deleted (I'm including it so that you can find the changeset
which deleted the definitions but forgot the declarations in).
They were used in 2.6.9
arch/x86_64/kernel/setup64.c and arch/x86_64/ia32/sys_ia32.c to implement the
NX option:
arch/x86_64/ia32/sys_ia32.c-{
arch/x86_64/ia32/sys_ia32.c-    if (prot & PROT_READ)
arch/x86_64/ia32/sys_ia32.c:            prot |= vm_force_exec32;
arch/x86_64/ia32/sys_ia32.c-    return sys_mprotect(start,len,prot);
arch/x86_64/ia32/sys_ia32.c-}
The above sample code from 2.6.9 or'ed the mask with vm_force_exec32, which
was PROT_EXEC (NX disabled) or 0 (NX enabled) depending on the user's choice
at boot.
This was deleted because probably replaced by a check on current->personality
in do_mmap_pgoff().
