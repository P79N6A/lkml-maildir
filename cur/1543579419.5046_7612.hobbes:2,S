Wonderful! A case where I can compare a working setup with a nonworking
one! :) Could you please send me the usual stuff (dmesg, lspci -vvxxx,
cat /proc/ide/via, hdparm -i /dev/hd*, hdparm -t /dev/hd*) for both the
2.2 case and the 2.4.0+VIA-latest case? That'll allow me to find the
differences and possibly fix the new driver.
