Hi,
I have Acer TravelMate 242 serie and I have these problems with 2.4 kernel:
1) Compiling into kernel Local APIC causes kernel not booting after reboot - 
Kernel writes Loading kernel and when finished PC freezes. Removing Local 
Apic causes working kernel
problem under 2.6.0-test9 too
2) USB 2.0 - notebook has 4 USB 2.0 ports - modprobe usb-ehci causes loading 
USB and kernel finds USB ports, but when I plug in mouse or BT adapter or 
harddrive into usb ports, those are not recognized anymore.
When I load usb-uhci all works fine, but communication is too slow with my usb 
2.0 harddrive
problem under 2.6.0-test9 too
3) IRDA - there is a new version of existing chip - driver is here and works 
excellent and is backported from 2.6:

When will be this patch included into 2.4 vanilla?
Thanks for reply
Michal
