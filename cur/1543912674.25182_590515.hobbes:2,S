Life isn't so black and white.
 * We have stuff go into the tree that isn't experimental on a regular
   basis, due to proving outside of Linus' tree, be that in -mm, or
   a distro tree, or anywhere else.
 * We've had code become undeprecated a few times.
 * Likewise stuff has sometimes got so fucked up that it's become
   experimental again (see the longhaul driver for a great example
   of a catastrophe in motion).

Again, not so black and white.
It's feasible that something can be experimental on one architecture,
stable on another (typically x86), or even deprecated on x86, but still
supported on other architectures.
It's not just a per arch thing either, in some cases, we've had
differing levels of maturity based upon other hardware constraints,
or even varying versions of system software.

Kconfig is an awful mechanism for tracking whether something is stable or not.
Take for example the skge net driver.  It's "perfect" on some systems,
and utterly busted on others. How would you express that in Kconfig ?
