Ok, so we've got the RAID5 issue explained, does anybody have any idea
about what's wrong with the non-RAID5 cases? We've got at least one report
of page corruption on RAID0, and one on a plain disk. Both of which looked
XFS-related - or at least shared that in their configs.
Jerome - can you test Nathan's patch together with my "avoid the
complicated slab logic"? The slab avoidance thing got ext3 stable for you,
now with Nathan's patch hopefully XFS will be stable too.
Which still doesn't _explain_ anything, but it would be interesting to see
if that removes your problems. It would definitely point to a slab issue,
but the big question is why it's not more common if so. Compiler bug?
Other strange trigger?
