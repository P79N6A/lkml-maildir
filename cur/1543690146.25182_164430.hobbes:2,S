Your remap call isn't adding _PAGE_NO_CACHE and _PAGE_GUARDED flags
like ioremap_nocache()/ioremap() do on PPC.  You'll get bad results
because of the ordering and cache issues resulting from not using
these PTE flags.  In 2.6, these can be added using pgprot_noncached()
that is defined per-arch.
BTW, ioremap_nocache() and ioremap() are identical on PPC.
