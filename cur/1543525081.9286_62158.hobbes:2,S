Yes --- you need 8k allocations to be 8k-aligned physically, and 64k
allocations to be 64k-aligned, etc.  Just to think of one example, Intel
MTRR absolutely requires that the address of a memory range is a
multiple of the size of the range, and you need aligned zones to create
such regions.
This needn't be a problem --- you can easily create a zone aligned at a
large (eg. 16MB) granularity, without filling it with free pages.  As an
example, the low-memory zone doesn't populate the free page list with
pages in the 640k-1M hole.  Just because your physical page region isn't
aligned nicely doesn't mean you cannot align the zone itself.
