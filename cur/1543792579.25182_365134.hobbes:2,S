nbd does more than I want.
_All_ that is needed is flipping requests <somehow> to/from userspace. 
nbd messes directly with sockets and such, which I don't want.  It does 
way too much, hardcodes way too much.
loop is a closer model to a generic userspace block device than nbd, I 
think.
Though, answering your question directly, I do get the impression that 
in-kernel nbd has been left behind in favor of drbd and enbd, out in the 
few places where nbd-ish solutions are used.
