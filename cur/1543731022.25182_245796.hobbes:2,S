The real issue is what to do with unlink() et.al. on these guys.  Note
that "unlink is OK if all we have there is a bunch of directory mounts"
won't work well - we have no good way to check that condition.
Even funnier one is what we do if we have directory mounted there *and*
have something mounted on stuff in that directory.
Yes, that's one of the probable directions for such stuff, but there's a
lot of fun semantics questions and answers to them will matter a lot.
Hey, if we lose the "can't unlink/rmdir/rename over something that is
a mountpoint in other life" - I'm happy and we can get a lot of much
more interesting stuff to work.  It will take some work (e.g. making
sure we can find all vfsmounts over given mountpoint and sorting out
the locking issues, which won't be trivial), but the main obstacle in
that direction is not in architecture - it's in SuS and tradition; as
the matter of fact, our life would be much easier if we stopped trying
to give -EBUSY here and just dissolved all subtrees mounted on anything
that has that dentry.
