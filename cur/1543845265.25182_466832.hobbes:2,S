I should have spelled out my point a bit more.  If you've got a flag 
you're just testing, couldn't you just do:
	if (__mark_enabled_##name)
		(*__mark_func)(...);
and do without the asms or the section?
The section will still be useful for simply labelling the mark sites, 
but if you want to call something there, you don't need it.
