Common new IOMMUs have only very few in common with the AGP GART. In
fact, with current modern IOMMU hardware it will be possible to
implement secure userspace device drivers that are even able to do DMA.
This is not possible with the GART.

Modern IOMMUs are able to remap interrupts. This will solve the problem
with PCI interrupt sharing.
