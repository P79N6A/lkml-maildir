Tried to build a fres i386 kernel with your config.
As I'm running on latest from Linus I could see that all your
reported warnings were gone.
But one new warning crept in for which I have prepared a patch -
to be submitted when I have test-builded a bit more.
Anyway - thanks for reporting and sending your .config.
