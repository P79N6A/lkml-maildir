Again, you can do every "advanced" setup already today with poking
around in the bind/unbind files in sysfs. Userspace just receives an
event from the kernel and can do whatever it wants to do with the event:
ignore it, load a specific module, start a userspace driver, or just ask
modprobe to load the kernel supplied default module.
The modalias is just a convenient way to provide a "default" module
autoloading and is not expected to become a system management
replacement with full featured policy integration. I don't really see
a "real world" problem here. If some day we support this stuff and need
a new interface we can just do this if someone proposes a better
solution. For now modalias works just fine. As long as we have device
table matches _in_ the kernel modules, there is no reason not to export
the match value from the kernel at the same time.
Thanks,
Kay
