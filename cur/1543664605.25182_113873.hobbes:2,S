hello everyone !
the kernel barfs and tells me to supply a root= kernel param.
i tried root=/dev/sda2, but no luck.
hw is all-scsi p2b-ds w/ dual p3/600.
boot is ext2, root (/dev/sda2) is reiserfs.
i'm using the new aic7xxx driver, the old driver one hangs at the same 
time, but continues to spit out a ton of error msgs i haven't bothered 
to capture, since i'm told it's deprecated.
the aic7xxx as well as ext2 and reiserfs are compiled into the kernel.
i'm not using devfs.
the system boots fine with 2.4.20.
google spit out these somewhat related threads, but they petered out 
without a solution.

i'd welcome clues, and i'd be happy to run further tests if you tell me 
which :)
please cc: me on replies, i'm not subscribed, and the archives take ages 
to pick up new postings....
best,
jörn
