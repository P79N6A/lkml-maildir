This smells like an unknown bug in kernel.
It is unknown, hence there is no workaround (but upgrading to 2.4).
It would be better to understand the issue f.e. trying to restore
the history of this descriptor.

And this is bug in the application, which forgot to close file.
Descriptor leakage in httpd or it is blocked at some another job.
But remembering about the first case, I am not so sure.
What does httpd make this time?
