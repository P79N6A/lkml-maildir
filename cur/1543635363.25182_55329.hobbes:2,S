Just wondering - has anyone ever given any thought to the idea of a RAM disk that is not erased on a warm boot?
Obviously this is a bit architechture-specific - I don't think it's easily do-able on i386, but maybe it is other architechtures?
The idea of a recoverable, (even bootable), RAM disk was common on the Amiga, and it would be useful to, E.G. quickly re-boot in to several different kernels.
