You're being thick today.  Pay attention to the arguments.
A counting semaphore is NOT a perfectly fine mutex, and it SHOULD be changed.
People are indeed unhappy with the naming, and whether patching 95%
of the callers of up() and down() is a good idea is a valid and active
subject of debate.  (For an out-of-tree -rt patch, is was certaintly
an extremely practical solution.)
But regardless of the eventual naming convention, mutexes are a good idea.
A mutex is *safer* than a counting semaphore.  That's the main benefit.
Indeed, unless there's a performance advantage to a counting semaphore,
you should use a mutex!
It documents in the source what you're doing.  Using a counting semaphore
for a mutex is as silly as using a float for a loop index.  Even if
there isn't much speed penalty on modern processors.
Or perhaps I should compare it to using void * everywhere.  That's a
perfectly fine pointer; why type-check it?
A separate mutex type allows extra error-checking.  You can keep track
of the current holder (since there can be only one) and check that the
same person released it and didn't try to double-acquire it.
You can do priority inheritance, which is the main motivation for doing
this work in the -rt patches.
This isn't about speed, it's about bug-free code.  And having a mutex
abstraction distinct from a general counting semaphore is damn useful
error-checking, even if it is simply a thin wrapper over a counting
semaphore.  The only reason the code is full of counting semaphores
right now is that that's all people had.
Better to give them the right tool.
