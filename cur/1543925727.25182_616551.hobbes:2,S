Subject: [PATCH] xen: mask _PAGE_PCD from ptes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

_PAGE_PCD maps a page with caching disabled, which is typically used
for mapping harware registers.  Xen never allows it to be set on a
mapping, and unprivileged guests never need it since they can't see
the real underlying hardware.  However, some uncached mappings are
made early when probing the (non-existent) APIC, and its OK to mask
off the PCD flag in these cases.
