A microoptimisation because they've turned on DEBUG_PREEMPT and found
that smp_processor_id slows down? ;) Wouldn't it be better to just stick
to the normal rules (ie. what Keith said)?
It may be obvious in this case (though that doesn't help people who make
obvious mistakes, or mismerge patches) but this just seems like a nasty
precedent to set (or has it already been?).
