Well, I went and opened the case.
Lo and behold the bottom bank had three DIMMs while the top bank had only one. 
Not sure if it came like that or if someone messed with it. I moved one of the 
DIMMs to even it out, and sure enough its showing up with the full amount now.
Sorry to bother you all...
