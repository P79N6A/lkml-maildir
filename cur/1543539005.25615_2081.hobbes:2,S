'tput rs1' also restores original settings.
Few others have also encountered this problem...

So far there has been problems with:
Geforce 256 / Pentium 3 (i820 chipset)
Voodoo 3 / ? (BX chipset)
Permedia 2 / Athlon (AMD-751 chipset)
TNT2 ultra / ? (?)
All AGP cards, 2.4.0-test4 and XFree 4.0.1 ... :)
Mathieu Chouquet-Stringer posted a quick fix-up for this

I'll try if that works...
