Hi, there.
I am looking for gigabit NIC running on Linux 2.0.36.
(the version is importent.)
and, I found the Packet Engines "Yellowfin". but,
purchasing is difficult in South Korea.
Would you suggest other gigabit NIC with nice
performance ?
or,
Could anyone explain me how to port gigabit NIC driver
from the 2.2.x to 2.0.36 ?
Thanks in advance.
