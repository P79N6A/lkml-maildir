You're not understanding. This is not a bug. This is intended behavior. 
The problem is that this behavior is not neccisarily desirable. I have 
attempted to propose something that can be TRIED in order to attempt to 
optimize swap behavior for certain situations, primarily desktop usage.
This is not a bug.
There is nothing unusual about it.
I am not attempting to report a bug.
There is no need to collect data.
We have all the data we need from any number of complaints about 
current swap behavior.
Something needs to be tried, I proposed something to be tried, I did 
not report a bug, I did not say this was unusual for 2.4.x series.
