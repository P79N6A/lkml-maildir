Oh, I guess you missed one point: using jeremy's elf hacks, it is well
possible to add ELF note to existing executable [this is why I done
this!]. So, in your example, you just
setcap -c NET_RAW -sd /bin/ping
which does really strange things with that elf executable (basically
takes it to the pieces and puts them back), but at the end you have
executable that will drop everything bug NET_RAW far before main().

I need not to compile. I just setcap ... on existing executable.

PS: I'm actually preparing capcheck script which will go after all
known suid executables and give them just permissions they need.
