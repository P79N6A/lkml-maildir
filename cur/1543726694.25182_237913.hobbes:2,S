You want to use request_region() instead, check_region() is deprecated and 
everything still using it is being moved to use request_region().
also, take a look at drivers/parport/parport_pc.c for examples.
You can also get useful info from
cat /proc/ioports
cat /proc/iomem
cat /proc/modules
You may also want to take a look at
