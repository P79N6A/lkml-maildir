   	Martin Diehl has finished converting all the old style dongle
   driver to the new API. This was the last major feature parity issue
   with 2.4.X, with this work, 2.6.X should support all the IrDA serial
   dongles that 2.4.X supports. Martin also did a few other cleanups and
   fixed tekram-sir so that it works with real hardware.
All applied.  I'll queue this up.  I'll try to get it in
now but it may be deferred to the next 2.6.x release.
