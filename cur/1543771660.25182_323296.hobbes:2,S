	You'll have to explain the "architectural flexibility and 
maintainability" costs . Questioning if plist works correctly isn't 
a long term maintainability problem, in my mind. I don't see any 
architectural costs considering the plist API, which is why I saw a clear 
path to integrate plist in the first place. 
	For me it's strictly a speed question. I was reviewing V0.7.40-04 
and it looks like apples and oranges to me. It's more a question of where 
do you perfer the latency , in up() or in down() .. plist is slower for 
non-RT tasks, but non-RT tasks also get the benefit of priority ordering.
