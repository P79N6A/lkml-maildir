as i told you before, it is basic taste. Show me the CodingStyle rules 
that forbids this construct:
	if((((i+-+-+-+-+1-1))))
		var=0;;;;;;;
instead of:
	if (i)
		var = 0;
?
You will find no explicit rule in CodingStyle that explicitly forbids 
any aspect of this line, because CodingStyle mainly concentrates on the 
harder to follow rules. So please use common sense in combination with 
CodingStyle.
(And even if you dont agree with the taste, "if ( )" is done by 98% of 
core code, so for the sake of consistency it's the thing to follow.)

What is your point?
ugly code is not at all uncommon, sadly - but i'm glad that it's only 6% 
in this particular case (and 1.9% for core kernel code).

it is not offtopic, because you _are_ nitpicking over style issues 
(which is OK and desirable, if not overdone), while still seeming to 
believe that "if(" is fine :-) The one who judges others is judged by 
higher standards. In other words, i'm trying to fix the guy who is 
fixing others ;-)
