Greg KH thinks it's a good idea to add language directories to the top level 
of Documentation, and there are slightly more than two of those:
http://www.translatorscafe.com/cafe/Help.asp?HelpID=59
Since you think it's worth doing, I'll resubmit the work I've already done 
here, but I no longer think trying to shovel Documentation into some 
semblance of order against the will of people like Greg is a good use of 
time.
These days I'm trying to create an html index that links into Documentation in 
a coherent order (with categories and everything), and using automated tools 
to detect files that aren't linked to, or links that point to a file that 
isn't there anymore.  This is obviously still a work in progress, but I think 
it's a better approach.

If moving text files from one location to another in the Documentation 
directory breaks the build or causes bugs in the kernel, we have bigger 
problems. :)
