It's just plain courtesy.  You get the fix out before you get the
exploit out.  If you do it the other way around, the users suffer.  I
read BUGTRAQ too, and people complain mightily when an exploit is posted
before an attempt at a fix has been made.
Doesn't matter now.  I don't even know why I bothered trying to convince
MR. CAPS LOCK of this.
