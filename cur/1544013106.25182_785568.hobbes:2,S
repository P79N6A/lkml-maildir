The source is up to around 38k loc, I thought it better to use that http
thing for people who were interested in the code.
There is also a standalone git repo:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mason/btrfs-unstable-standalone.git;a=summary
This has only btrfs as a module and would be the fastest way to see
the .c files.  btrfs doesn't have any changes outside of fs/Makefile and
fs/Kconfig
(happy new year ;)
