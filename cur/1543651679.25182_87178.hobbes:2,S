Reasons 1 and 2 were that you can't be sure it works on all compiler versions 
and all platforms until you'e tried it, which you could say about anything.
Reason 3, 5, and 6 were about performance gains, when the point of CONFIG_TINY 
is, in fact, size.
Reason 4 is inertia.  You are explicitly considering inertia a good reason, 
then?  I remember back around 1998, the argument over "-fno-strength-reduce" 
which accomplished nothing whatsoever (and was in fact disabled in gcc 2.7.x 
for i386) but was in the kernel compile for a long time becaue nobody could 
be bothered to remove it...

1) The point of CONFIG_TINY is size?
2) Why is any change a "force" when you have the source code?  Isn't "force" 
an intentionally loaded word?  I could just as easily say your objection 
still boils down to "I don't want a switch that actually does something, I 
want somebody to print out a to-do list and mail it to me so I can go through 
the kernel by hand and remove support for floppy drives other than the actual 
type I have from the legacy boot sector at the start of the kernel image."  
If you want to get into loaded words.
The setting in question is a default value.  CONFIG_TINY sets a lot of 
defaults at once, and gives you something grep for if you don't like them.  I 
realise this isn't what you want, but objecting to patches because they're 
completely unrelated to what you want is kind of silly.
