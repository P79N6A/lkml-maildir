"'LINUX-TRACECALLS' finds all call chains leading to a given function in the Linux
kernel, to some arbitrary depth. It consists of two parts - a set of specially
prepared cscope databases for the kernel source tree, and a perl program, 'lnxtc.pl',
to do the call chain discovery based on the information in the cscope DBs."
"It works, in part, by expanding function-yielding macros and by mangling function names
with the name of the file containing the function's definition, prior to creating the
cscope files."
"It is believed to be highly accurate.."
