This is going back some way, but this was the original commit message:
# --------------------------------------------
# 03/02/18	gerg@snapgear.com	1.984
# [PATCH] use local RODATA setup for m68knommu linker script
#
# This patch removes the use of the common RODATA define in the m68knommu
# architecture. It cannot be used the same way for the m68knommu target.
# For starters just inserting it here is syntactically wrong. All the read
# only parts are grouped into a single "text" segment, and this is the root
# cause of the problem. So for the m68knommu arch it makes sense to not
# use the generic RODATA setup, but to list them locally.
The problem looks to be the same today.
The current vmlinux.lds.S for m68knommu directs sections out to ROM
or RAM depending on whether we are building to be run from some type
of read only memory (ROM, FLASH, etc) or RAM. The RODATA macro as it
stands doesn't allow that.
Regards
Greg
