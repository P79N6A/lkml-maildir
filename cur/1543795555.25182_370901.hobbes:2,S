This all looks exotically complex.

- You don't state _why_ a callback cannot call
  notifier_chain_unregister().  I assume that's because of the use of
  write_lock() locking?
  We could do this with a new callback function return code and do it in
  the core, or just change the code so it is permitted.
- You don't explain why RCU has been introduced into this subsystem. 
  Seems overkillish, or was it done as a way to solve the correctness
  problems?
- Generally, please don't put so much stuff into the [patch 0/N] email. 
  We never put empty patches into git so some sucker has to move all the
  [0/N] content into [1/N].  Better that it's you than me.
- Overall take on the patches: the problem here is that notifier chains
  try to provide their own locking.  Each time we design a container which
  does that, we screw it up and we regret it.
  Please consider removing all locking from the notifer chains and moving
  it into the callers.
  A migration path would be:
  - Introduce a new notifier API which is wholly unlocked
  - Migrate all callers over to that
  - Remove the current implementation
  Note that with this scheme, callbacks which wish to call the unregister
  function can do that, as long as they are not using read_lock() or
  down_read() during the chain traversal.
