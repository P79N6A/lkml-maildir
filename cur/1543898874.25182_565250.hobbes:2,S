As far as I remember at OLS we decided to implement per-zone RLU
lists and reuse the lru lock as well. This will remove all the 
problems with per-container lists inconsistency.
Separate limits for RSS and RSS+pagecache are also a must.
BTW, if you send smb. else's patches you may include a 'From: xxx'
line into the letter to address the original author.
