You know, I wish I had an easy answer to that, but I don't.  It's a matter
of sticking a printk in there, running careful tests, making sure that
we're doing the right thing at the right time.
As we discussed earlier, it could be that in some some situations we should
hold onto the reservation window after the file has been closed - the
slowly-growing mbox or logfile problem.  But without causing bandwidth
regressions in the the many-small-files scenario.

hm, I need to look at the new code more closely.  I was hoping that we
could divorce the reservation windows from any knowledge of blockgroups. 
Is that not the case?

This sounds awfully like get_unmapped_area().
