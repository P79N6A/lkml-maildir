When I recieved my laptop last week, I had windows preinstalled on and 
before reinstalling a proper free system, I wanted to have a look to 
that feature, so I lauched the ibm HDAPS monitor. But to my mind 
precision is not really good, and when you roll your laptop twice or 
more the monitor forget its initial position and movements are only 
relative (may be a software issue, I don't know). But i love your idea ;)
