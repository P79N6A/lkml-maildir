thanks, i'll try this patchset in x86.git.

1kcpus-after means it's +23314404-147590, i.e. +23166814? (i.e. a 0.6% 
reduction of the bloat?)
i.e. we've got ~22K bloat per CPU - which is not bad, but because it's a 
static component, it hurts smaller boxes. For distributors to enable 
CONFIG_NR_CPU=1024 by default i guess that bloat has to drop below 1-2K 
per CPU :-/ [that would still mean 1-2MB total bloat but that's much 
more acceptable than 23MB]
