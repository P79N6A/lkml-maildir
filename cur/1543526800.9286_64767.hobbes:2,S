Right, except that that compressed RAM is decompressed whenever it is
used in a working space or in cache.  The same would have to be true
of the encrypted RAM, a small amount of it would be decrypted in RAM
whenever it is being used and so root would be able to copy those bits
that are decrypted and re-assemble it later, if root didn't find the
key cached in RAM first.

It doesn't hurt to be creative and ask questions...
