Linux modules are not agnostic, they too are SMP specific.
Because a module may use spinlocks.
Modules should really be compiled with the kernel.  They are an
intersting way to save some memory, they are not a way of
distributing drivers or anything like that.

You would also get rid of performance.  The agnostic kernel would be
slower than simply running the SMP kernel on UP.
Here's why:
You can easily make an "agnostic kernel & modules" by changing the
spinlocks to function calls.  Then you'll provide a null stub call site
for running UP, and the real spinlock code for running SMP.
Unfortunately, this gives the overhead of a function call, both for SMP
and for UP.  This overhead is usually _bigger_ than the overhead of a
inlined spinlock.
So if you aim for a simple distribution - go for SMP.  The loss on UP is
small. I have haerd of cases when the SMP setup code fails on UP
when smp hardware is missing.  You could of course work to eliminate
that.
