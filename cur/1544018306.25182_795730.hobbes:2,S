This it not true for all cases. What if you do need to start this task
and free something else outside the given set? This should be an
administrative decision and not forced by the kernel. We used to have it
that way, but it does not mean that it is the only correct way to do the
things.

In this case administrator will not do this. It is up to him to decide
and not some inner kernel policy.
