Greetings,
I see there is still no resolution on this problem. I tried 2.6.5,
did'nt work, noapic doesn't do shit either. Upgrading Abit Bios to
latest (an7_15) did'nt do anything.
However I found the following: the bug only triggers when I'm using both
SATA channels. With two drives, but only one connected, no problem seems
to occur.
HTH
