LTC test has updated the 2.5 test runs on both the ltp and osdl site.
The actual pages are for the LTP site at:
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/execmatrix.php
or OSDL site at:
http://www.osdl.org/projects/26lnxstblztn/results/linstab-web/ltc/execut25_324rev1.html
We were able to run several long runs (over 96 hours) on PPC64 as well
as on IA32.  Runs were done on 2.5.70 (4), 2.5.69 (3), and 2.4.68 (1). 
Some recent examples from the matrix are:
2.5.69  Pagepoker/Apache  IBM 7026 B80, 2-way, 3GB RAM default kernel
config for PPC64 SuSE SLES 8 for PPC64 181 hours  Completed
successfully. 
2.5.69  ltp 2 instances  IBM 7026 B80, 2-way, 3GB RAM default kernel
config for PPC64 SuSE SLES 8 for PPC64 336 hours  Completed successfully
with no new errors from ltp.
