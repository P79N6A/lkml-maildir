It is intended, thanks. Not only does it make the inter_module_xxx case
work reliably, but it also allows you to compile the code at all under
2.0 uCLinux. The reason it was omitted from test12 is because there are a
handful of other changes to the CFI code which I haven't yet tested as
thoroughly as I want to. If you're using CFI flash, please could you test
the latest version from my CVS tree and let me know the results?
