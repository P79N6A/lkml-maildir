I used 0.9.6 too, it had a slight bug in the randomization test
(getmain.c), which I pointed out in another post.
void foo( int unused )
{
        printf( "%p\n", __builtin_return_address(0) );
        //printf( "0x%08x\n", ((unsigned long*)&unused)[-1] );
}
I'm curious as to what the hell you're doing to get these results.  Exec
Shield came with the sysctl sys/kernel/exec-shield = 1 and
sys/kernel/exec-shield-randomize = 1.  I tried exec-shield = 0, 1, 2,
and 3 and couldn't get anything but the stack to kill on a Barton cored
32 bit athlon xp.
The tests I did were on a Fedora Core 3 i net-installed last night, no
adulteration.  Whatever black magic you're doing, it's not working here.
