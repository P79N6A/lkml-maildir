I've done some research and probably I've found thing that caused all 
this problems.
EXT-P2P's Discard Time in BIOS is default set to 30 us, when I've change 
this to 1 ms I couldn't reproduce any of my previous erros.
On Abit website in NF7-S V2.0 BIOS section there is interesting log in 
changelog:
"Fixed SATA RAID-0 data corruption issue by adding a new option
"EXT-P2P's Discard Time" in "integrated Peripherals". The default
setting is "30 us" ; which is recommended by NVidia. In case the problem 
is still there, try "1 ms" please."
I don't have RAID but somehow it (1 ms) fixed my problem.
Maybe if this is possible, kernel should change "Discard Time" to 1 ms 
on Abit NF7-S V2.0 ?
