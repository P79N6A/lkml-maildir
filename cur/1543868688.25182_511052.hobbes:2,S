Make sure your system is idle.  Userspace bloat means that *lots* of idle 
activity occurs in between timer ticks on recent distributions -- all those 
widgets polling the hardware to see if something changed or needs updating 
do a lot of damage to the caches.  Try comparing a run under init=/bin/bash 
with one while logged in to a desktop environment to see just how painful it 
is.
