That'd mean we have to add extra methods:
void uart_console_write(struct uart_port *port, const char *s,
                        unsigned int count,
                        void (*putchar)(struct uart_port *, int),
			void *(*pre_write)(struct uart_port *),
			void (*post_write)(struct uart_port *, void *));
where the pre-write places data into some kind of driver specific
structure which is allocated by some weird method, and post_write
restores this information.
Why are these driver specific?  Review all the users of uart_console_write
and you'll find that there's many different requirements for what is
done both before and after the uart_console_write method, most of
which should arguably fall under such a lock.
And I think that calling kmalloc() from within an oops (to allocate the
memory to pass the current state between pre and post write methods)
would be very bad news.
