Hi,
The QEMU x86 CPU emulator version 0.4 is available at
http://bellard.org/qemu.
 QEMU can now launch an unpatched(*) Linux
kernel and give correct execution performances by using dynamic
compilation.
QEMU requires no host kernel patches and no special priviledge in order
to run a Linux kernel. QEMU simulates a serial console and a NE2000
network adapter. X11 applications such as xterm have been launched.
QEMU can be used for example for faster kernel testing/debuging and
virtual hosting.
Enjoy!
Fabrice.
(*) Two bytes must be changed in order to remap the kernel at user
addresses.
