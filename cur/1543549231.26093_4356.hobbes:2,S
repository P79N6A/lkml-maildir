I experienced this same problem with 2.4.0-test9-pre4.  The NFS
server was a stock Red Hat 6.0 box running 2.2.5.
My workstation is running Linux-Mandrake 7.2 beta 2 with 2.4.0.9.4 patched
for ReiserFS 3.6.16, with all partitions formatted with ReiserFS 3.5.24.
When I tried to save a StarOffice 5.2 file in .doc format to the NFS server,
the workstation hung and did not respond for 10 minutes.  I could not telnet 
to it, but it did respond to pings.  I had to hit the big switch. Afterwards, 
the only lines in /var/log/messages (at the time of the problem) were:
Sep 19 13:11:27 spc kernel: NFS: NFSv3 not supported.
Sep 19 13:11:27 spc kernel: nfs warning: mount version older than kernel
I experienced some file corruption.  StarOffice would not run after reboot,
complaining about missing configuration files. 
I hope this helps,
	Steven
