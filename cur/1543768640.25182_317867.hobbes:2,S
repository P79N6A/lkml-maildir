Oh yeah that's possible (and maybe preferable - testing will need to
be done). But again it doesn't solve the corner cases where problems
happen. And it introduces more divergence to the balancing algorithms.
Basically I'm trying to counter the notion that the watchdog solution
is fundamentally better just because it allows indefinite sleeping and
backoff doesn't. You'll always be waking things up when they should
stay sleeping, and putting them to sleep only to require they be woken
up again.

Really smart usually == bad, especially when it's not something that
has been shown to be terribly critical.

My main concern is complexity, second concern is diminishing returns,
third concern is overhead on other CPUs :)
But I won't pretend to know it all - I don't have a good grasp of the
problem domains, so I'm just making some noise now so we don't put in
a complex solution where a simple one would suffice.
The best idea obviously would be to get the interested parties involved,
and get different approaches running side by side, then measure things!
