As mentioned, a file system cannot possibly be stable right after merge.
Having to change formatting is a sweeping change and certainly is a
barrier across which to look for auditing is all the more difficult.

OK, we have diametral experiences, and I'm not asking since I trust you
that I don't want to know, too :) Let's leave it at that.

Of course I do, same project lead, and probably many of the same
developers. While they may (and probably will) learn from mistakes,
changing style is more difficult - and that resulted in one of the major
non-acceptance reasons reiser4 suffered.
I won't subscribe to reiser4 specific topics before I've tried it, so
I'll quit. Same about ZFS by the way, it'll be fun some day to try on a
machine that it can trash at will, but for production, it will have to
prove itself first. After all, Sun are still fixing ufs and/or logging
bugs in Solaris 8. (And that's good, they still fix things, and it also
shows how long it takes to really get a file system stable.)

Lucky you. I haven't dared try it yet for lack of a test computer to
trash.

I thing naught about what they're going to put at stake. reiserfs 3 was
an utter failure for me. It was raved about, hyped, and the bottom line
was wasted time and a major disappointment.

I haven't asked what I'd find, because I'm not searching. And I might
find something else than you did - perhaps because you've picked up all
the good things already when I'll finally go there ;-)
