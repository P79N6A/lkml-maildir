Mmm... seems I may have got the ordering of the cpus wrong.
Something like this might work better in sched_topo_ht.h
(yeah, it's ugly. I don't care).
static inline int pool_to_cpu_mask (int pool)
{
	return ( (1UL << pool) || (1UL << cpu_sibling_map[pool]));
}
static inline cpu_to_pool (int cpu)
{
	return min(cpu, cpu_sibling_map[cpu]);
}
Thanks to Andi, Zwane, and Bill for the corrective baseball bat strike.
I changed the macros to inlines to avoid the risk of double eval.
