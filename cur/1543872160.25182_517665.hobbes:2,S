Seems like the device wants data from/to host and I have no idea why this
is happening.  It might be that this particular CF has problems with one
of the commands that IDE driver issues during device initialization.
I assume that device is recognized properly by the driver during probe, right?
If so probably adding some debugging printks (i.e. dumping status register)
to ide-disk.c:idedisk_setup() would shed some more light at the problem...

Yep, disabling this config option should have the same effect as "ide=nodma".
However the kernel parameter should work too (bug in the host driver?).

This is a bit suspicious... R/W multiple with max/current count == 1?
You may try disabling CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE or even #ifdef 0 all
the code in ide-probe.c:ide_disk_init_mult_count() (it seems to try
to enable multiple PIO support even if the config option is disabled).

There is seems to be some more mistery here (but if the multiple
PIO support is indeed buggy that would explain why the device stops
responding here)...
