Let's see.  The core of the uncontended down() on ARM looks like this:
	mrs     r0, cpsr
	orr     r1, r0, #128
	msr     cpsr_c, r1
	ldr     r1, [%0]
	subs     r1, r1, #1
	str     r1, [%0]
	msr     cpsr_c, r0
	blt	__contention
On a 624MHz ARMv5 processor I can execute this sequence approximately 
266100 times in 10 ms, which means approx 23 cycles.  The uncontended 
up() is the same except the sub is replaced by an add.
Removing the interrupt masking/unmasking reduces the above sequence to 4 
instructions using 6 cycles.  However it becomes completely unsafe wrt 
usage of up() from interrupt handlers, and it is completely preemption 
unsafe.
Now if we consider simple mutexes, the core of it becomes this on ARM:
	mov	r0, #1
	swp	r1, r0, [%0]
	cmp	r1, #0
	bne	__contention
The above takes 8 cycles.  It uses 4 instructions, and it could even be 
reduced to 3 when gcc's cse optimization can find a register that 
already contains the value 1 (then using only 7 cycles).  It is 
interrupt safe.  It is preemption safe.  It is small.
So if you think ARM is important, and if you consider the above a good 
enough improvement (I do), then that should talk in favor of simple 
mutexes for the kernel.  And it will have the nice side effect of making 
it easier on some other more obscur architectures.
