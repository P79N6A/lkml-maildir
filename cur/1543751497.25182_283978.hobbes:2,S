When i launch neverball (3d games), X get killed and I have the
following error in dmesg (3d card 9200SE, xserver : Xorg) :
[drm:radeon_cp_init] *ERROR* radeon_cp_init called without lock held  
[drm:drm_unlock] *ERROR* Process 10657 using kernel context 0
reverting the following patches solve the problem:
agpgart-add-bridge-parameter-to-driver-functions.patch
agpgart-allow-multiple-backends-to-be-initialized.patch
drm-add-support-for-new-multiple-agp-bridge-agpgart-api.patch
I tried the fix from Mike Werner, but it doesn't work in my case.
I can provide more information if needed.
regards,
Benoit
