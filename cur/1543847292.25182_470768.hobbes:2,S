- In do_no_page() there's a `goto retry' where we appear to have
  forgotten to (conditionally) unlock the page.
- In do_no_page() the COW-break code seem to have forgotten to
  (conditionally) unlock the page which it just COWed?
- In do_no_page(), the unlock_page() which _is_ there doesn't test
  VM_CAN_INVALIDATE before deciding to unlock the page.
I have a bad feeling that I'm not getting the point here...

Ah, it appears you've fixed at least some of these things in the next
patch.  Tricky.
