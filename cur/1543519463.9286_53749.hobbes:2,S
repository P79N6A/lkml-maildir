Subject: Patch for mmap code in 2.3.31 kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/12/16/5

I discovered a glitch in the mmap code for the 2.3.31 kernel.  When the
routine `unmap_fixup' needs to split a VMA into two separate areas it
sets the page offset for the two areas incorrectly.  The following patch
fixes this problem.
I've also included a test program that demonstrates the failure.  The test
creates a file with a known pattern (the integers 0 to (file size/4), uses
that file to `mmap' an area of memory and then re-mmap's a portion of
the mmap'ed area.  The program then scans the mmap'ed area and verifies
that all integers match the expected value, printing out the first integer
that doesn't match on failure and printing out the sum of the mmap'ed area
no matter what.
