Nope - USB problem.  I suggest you apply this:
--- linux-2.4.0-test10-pre5/mm/page_alloc.c	Tue Oct 24 21:34:13 2000
+++ linux-akpm/mm/page_alloc.c	Thu Oct 26 23:40:13 2000
@@ -527,6 +527,7 @@
 
 	/* No luck.. */
 	printk(KERN_ERR "__alloc_pages: %lu-order allocation failed.\n", order);
+	BUG();
 	return NULL;
 }
 
and when the kernel crashes, feed the log through ksymoops so we
can see where the failing allocation attempt is occurring.
[ You could put a show_stack(0) in here, but I believe ksymoops
  doesn't understand show_stack() output ].
