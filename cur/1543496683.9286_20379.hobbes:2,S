Ooops, of course I meant to write recever, not sender @) 
Your paragraph says what I meant to write. So I think we agree on the cause
of the problems.

Agreed.

I did a patch now to handle extend quick ack mode to more packets. Let me test
it a bit more here, then we can try if it helps for the benchmarks.
One problem is the interaction between quick acks and fast retransmit. 2.2 enables
quick ack mode as soon as a OOO packet is received, under the assumption that the
sender is in slow start now. With fast retransmit this is not true, but because
it only accelerates a single ack and the next received packet in a fast retrans
situation is usually OOO too (and would have cause a fast ack anyways) it doesn't matter.
With multiple quickacks it is differently, sending many acks too quickly after fast
retrans could disturb the ack clock. I have to think a bit more about the best solution
here.
