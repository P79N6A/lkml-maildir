Subject: Hard freeze when loading Neomagic NM256 driver

I am experiencing a problem the likes of which I haven't really seen on 
Linux before. I am trying to load the nm256_audio.o & supporting modules on 
a Dell Latitude LS laptop. The result is an instantaneous freeze - no kernel 
oops, no log messages, nothing. The computer must then be manually shut off; 
neither the 3-finger salute or issuing a suspend command via the keyboard 
does anything. The machine just dies as soon as I try to load the module.  I 
compiled the module under both 2.2.16-3 and 2.4.0-test2 and had the exact 
same problem under both. I have seen many people get NeoMagic sound support 
to work fine under Linux, in some cases using the exact same system as me, 
so I'm a little befuddled as to what is going on here. I tried loading the 
module in X windows, out of X, in single user mode, loading it with PnP 
support disabled in the BIOS, loading it with the onboard modem & ethernet 
chips disabled in the BIOS, and many combinations thereof, yet I still have 
the exact same problem. I wish I had more/any debugging information to post, 
but like I said I'm not getting a kernel oops, log message, or anything. 
About the best thing I can do is give you my /proc/pci output:
Bus  1, device   0, function  0:
    VGA compatible controller: Neomagic Corporation [MagicMedia 256AV] (rev 
32).
      IRQ 10.
      Master Capable.  Latency=128.  Min Gnt=16.Max Lat=255.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xf6000000 [0xf6ffffff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfe400000 [0xfe7fffff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfeb00000 [0xfebfffff].
  Bus  1, device   0, function  1:
    Multimedia audio controller: Neomagic Corporation [MagicMedia 256AV 
Audio] (rev 32).
      IRQ 10.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xf7800000 [0xf7bfffff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfea00000 [0xfeafffff].
Any ideas, guys? I've been running Linux for 7 years and just never seen it 
crash like this before...
Thanks!
