Yes.

There is a one-to-one equivalence between kernel addresses and struct
page *s.

Yikes.  Yes, somebody snuck a completely bogus patch into 2.3.48.  The
_only_ reason vaddr should be used in get_page_map() is to act as an
argument to ZERO_PAGE() for architectures in which the zero page is
cache-coloured.  
This bug is not present in the patch I sent out last week.  I'll submit
the fixes to Linus shortly.
