If I am understanding correctly the problem is not the permission mode bits.
I think it would be reasonably easy to come up with a common set of those.
The problem is making a common interface for determining which user/entity
those bits need to be set for. For example, how is it gonna know that
00008997-e0f0-21d0-8100-08005a4728f0, AFS ID 35223, and uid=500(haumont) are
all actually user 'haumont'.  It gets even worse with groups, for example
haumont/admin, haumont:admin, and wheel should be the same group on my
machine.
Still, even a bad interface (char *, tell the filesystem you figure it out?)
would be better than nothing ...
