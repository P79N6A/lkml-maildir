It seems to me that the initial design goals of romfs were:
a) space efficiency
b) simplicity
..with performance basically ignored. On an actual ROM-backed
filesystem, alignment doesn't help you until it becomes large enough
that you can execute pages in place.
And I don't think your reproduceability concern was even on the radar.
So naming a new filesystem romfs which has the priorities:
a) performance
b) reproduceability
seems like it's going to disappoint and confuse people who were
aligned with the original goals.
