I downloaded the prepatch 15 and found it incomplete and incorrect satur
day (running 2.2.14pre13) and retried getting the file. boom filesystem 
f* up completely like it did with older kernels. 
It gave a file system panic; fsck ended in a fileld lost&found and no other 
files on the original places...
the disk is ide where it happened.
/dev/hda:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 1057/16/63, sectors = 1065456, start = 0
I don't have the exact error message here anymore as the fs failed.
just wanted to report it. currently rebuilding the root filesystem from
scratch and trying to document the required changes now since I am un-
able to backup the system right now. 
note that all partitions (/dev/hda1, 2, 3) were affected. 1 was msdos and
again files were lost; 2 and 3 were totally unaccessible.
