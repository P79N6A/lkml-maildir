Let's take a different example model - let's take two cars, where one car 
tries to follow the other, but it's limited in how it can change the speed 
(and sometimes the driver also falls asleep :) ).
First we want to match of course the speed of both cars, so that the 
distance between the cars increases as little as possible over time. 
Second we want to decrease the distance between the cars. The problem is 
to stop the correction when the distance is near zero, which is simple 
when we know the next time, we can change the speed, but if we miss the 
point we overshoot and the distance grows again.
It's possible to keep these two parameters separate, but it's actually 
simpler to look at them together, by simply looking some time ahead and 
calculate the position of the car at this time and thus the speed of the 
other car to reach this position.
The adjustment code basically does just this by using the difference in 
speed to calculate the upcoming error. The new patch now uses the current 
error to decide by how much to look ahead, basically if we already have a 
large error, we have to be more careful, but overshooting with a small 
adjustment doesn't do much harm.
In the patch below I left some debug prints, which are useful to check how 
good the error adjustment works. It should be close to the final version 
(minus the prints and plus some more comments).

The problem is we have conflicting goals, adjusting for an unknown number 
of lost ticks is bad for precise timekeeping. I prefer to assume that lost 
ticks are the exceptions and we need the help from the dynticks code to 
assure precise timekeeping.
