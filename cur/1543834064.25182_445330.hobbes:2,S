The reason is that arch-i386/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S is run through CPP, 
and it includes asm/thread_info.h and asm/page.h, which end up including 
"mach_page.h" (which this patch series introduces).  There is a version 
in both mach-default/mach_page.h and mach-xen/mach_page.h, so the -I is 
necessary for non-Xen sub-arches as well. 
I guess the conservative approach would be to only add this -I for the 
vmlinux.lds target, assuming there are no later compile problems.  On 
the flip-side, would you want C and Asm code getting a different set of 
includes from "manually" preprocessed-files?  I would think you'd want 
either defines/includes at all, or to have them identical.
The CPPFLAGS assignment also appears to make the previous two lines 
redundant, since a_flags and c_flags (which is what actually gets used 
for compilation) end up having CPPFLAGS incorporated into them.
