As Paulus also pointed out, having writel() behave differently based on
some magic done earlier at map time makes it harder to understand what
happens when reading the code, and thus harder to audit drivers for
missing barriers etc... since it's not obvious at first sight wether a
driver is using ordered or relaxed semantics. Thus I prefer keeping two
speparate interfaces.
We've come up with the __writel() name, but I'm open to proposals for
something nicer :)
Ben.
