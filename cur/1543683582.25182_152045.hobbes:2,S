What is the benefit of having it work as it does currently
in the standard kernel?  I too was supprised to find it works
this way, but have since converted to use source-routes.
Interestingly, can only use 252 or so source routes because
the rfc for netlink only gives us an 8-bit identifier for the
route id, so this still breaks if you want to run lots of
vlans or something like that.
