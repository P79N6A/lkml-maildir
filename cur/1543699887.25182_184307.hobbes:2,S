Well, two things to consider:
* probing is not a performance-intensive operation
* even with a system loaded down with many PCI Express devices, I doubt 
you will need more than 1-2MB mapped total, during runtime
So, one alternative could be to keep a cache of ioremap() regions -- 
smaller than 1MB in my opinion -- and update that as needed.
Anybody doing large numbers of PCI config register reads/writes in a hot 
path should be shot (or the h/w designers, depending on situation), and 
PCI Express doesn't change that ;-)
