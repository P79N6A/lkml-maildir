Yes from my part ;). It looks more correct than calling
io_remap_page_range under an #ifdef CONFIG_XEN. One thing I don't know
is why for example sparc isn't already doing that (like XEN is already
doing that with your patch).  Sparc and XEN are the only two archs where
io_remap_page_range isn't an alias to remap_pfn/page_range. It's much
nicer if we use io_remap_page_range in the same places for both sparc
and XEN. Though to get the final answer we should ask the sparc folks.
