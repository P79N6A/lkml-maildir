Not necessarily;  I can easily see distros wanting to have a "Restore  
defaults" button in their network config windows which also includes  
restoring the default MAC address to the NIC.  It should also be  
pointed out that anybody with one of a selection of re-flashable NICS  
(or NICS with removable EEPROMS) can easily change the MAC address on  
their NIC.  Other alternatives includes renaming eth0 to mynet0 and  
creating a downed dummy interface called "eth0" with the desired MAC  
addr.

Well for basically any userspace-level check, all it takes is  
somebody who knows ASM and has about 5 minutes to track down the  
problematic branch instructions.  Then they just have to write a 10- 
line GDB script which starts the program, traps the appropriate  
instructions, and then changes a "0" to a "1" (or vice versa) before  
the conditional branch.  On Windows it's vaguely practical (albeit  
crash-prone) to load a kernel hack which prevents your program from  
being debugged, but under Linux it's effectively impossible
