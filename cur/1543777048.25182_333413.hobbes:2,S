Seems unreasonable now but things like HDTV actually have much tighter
constraints than this.  And frame times this small are quite often used
for audio, which admittedly is less affected by HZ because those devices
generate their own interrupts.

Yes, for PAL/NTSC, but it's nice to be forward looking...
