Yes, that's what I meant.

I'm not sure what you mean here exactly. We have two different cases:
either the ACPI code did declare the PNP device, or it did not. How do
you unify both? And what "collision" are you talking about?

Not really. PNP devices may or may not be declared. PCI devices are
always declared. This is a fundamental difference. I'm also not sure
about the PNP IDs, see below.

But we _do_ have a problem to solve! That's what started this thread.
And we need to solve it before 2.6.24 is released. I'd rather (try to)
do the right thing now rather than going in one direction today and
doing something different next month.
I do agree that the quirks should be done at the PNP level and not in the
it87 driver.

If the IT87xxF device is declared, will it always the same PNP ID on
every system? I fear that the answer is no, in which case I see no
simple way to implement the it87 driver as a PNP driver.

Yes, very irritating. Especially when the ACPI way is not only
system-specific, but also very poor in terms of features compared to
what a native driver can do. This is the main reason why we still write
native drivers for hardware monitoring drivers despite the conflicts
with ACPI that arise on some systems.
