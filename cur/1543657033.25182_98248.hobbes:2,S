Subject: PATCH: put ext2 next to ext3 in config
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Minor little patch - this puts the Ext2 config switch next to the Ext3
config switch in the config menus, and also calls it Ext2 rather than
Second Extended.
