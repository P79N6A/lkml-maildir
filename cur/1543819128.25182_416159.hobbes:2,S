I'm having problems enabling DMA for my PATA HD.
hdparm -d1 /dev/hdb reports: 
HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
Of course, I'm super user. Nothing is printed in dmesg. 
I'm on linux-2.6.16 and motherboard is Fujitsu Siemens D1561 with an
ICH5. I also have a SATA hd in the computer and this only happens when
the SATA hd is there. If I remove the SATA HD, then I can enable DMA
for the PATA hd.
Both the SATA and the PATA are very new. 
# zcat /proc/config.gz |grep -i dma
CONFIG_GENERIC_ISA_DMA=y
CONFIG_ISA_DMA_API=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_FORCED is not set
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y
# CONFIG_IDEDMA_ONLYDISK is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
# CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB is not set
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
# CONFIG_SCSI_PDC_ADMA is not set
Any pointers as to what I can try?
