I tested it with an initramfs image with /sbin/modprobe being a shell
script that writes a few bytes to /dev/console, and does nothing else.
It did run for minutes here, until I stopped it.
Sure, if we can make userspace behave nicely, I'm all for doing it. On
the other hand, I think it's a good thing to provide a sane
environment by the kernel for any "non-initramfs-optimized" helper.
Writing to /dev/console is a usual behavior for tools used in
initramfs, to be able to debug bootup problems. In many cases it is
just glibc's fallback LOG_CONS, if syslog is not available.
Modprobe has syslog code, so it might very well be, that the Debian
initramfs isn't doing anything obscure.  The current behavior, is very
easy to trigger bug, and a pretty hard to debug setup, if you do not
add debugging code to the kernel code itself.
That's why I still think it's a good thing, to connect the core tty
devices to their dev_t handler internally, before we init all the
other drivers and run userspace. It will prevent any further needless
searches by the kernel, for a driver for the already created but just
not registered tty devices. We will do exactly the same dev_t
<->device connection (register_chrdev_region) anyway, directly after
loading all the other drivers.
Thanks,
