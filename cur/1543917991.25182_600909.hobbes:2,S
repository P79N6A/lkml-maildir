Hmm. The only situation where this can happen is when you add
"nolapic_timer" to the command line on a single CPU system. We do not
register the lapic "dummy" clock event device then.

Yup, I completely missed the fact, that we reject CPU#0 unplugging, so
your fix seems indeed to be more correct and simpler.
OTOH, the accounting hook would allow us to remove the IRQ#0 -> CPU#0
restriction. Not sure whether it's worth the trouble.
