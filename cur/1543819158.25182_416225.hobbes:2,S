But making it slower isn't going to be popular.
Why is your module using so much per-cpu memory, anyway?

It it would still add to the dependent loads on the critical path, so
it now prevents the compiler/programmer/oooe engine from speculatively
loading the __per_cpu_offset.
And it does increase cache footprint of per-cpu accesses, which are
supposed to be really light and substitute for [NR_CPUS] arrays.
I don't think it would have been hard for the original author to make
it robust... just not both fast and robust. PERCPU_ENOUGH_ROOM seems
like an ugly hack at first glance, but I'm fairly sure it was a result
of design choices.
