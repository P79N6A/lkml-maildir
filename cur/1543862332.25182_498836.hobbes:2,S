By no means.  The theory here is that CPUA is taking and releasing the
lock at high frequency, but CPUB never manages to get in and take it.  In
which case the maximum-acquisition-time is much larger than the
maximum-hold-time.
I'd suggest that you use a similar trick to measure the maximum hold time:
start the timer after we got the lock, stop it just before we release the
lock (assuming that the additional rdtsc delay doesn't "fix" things, of
course...)
