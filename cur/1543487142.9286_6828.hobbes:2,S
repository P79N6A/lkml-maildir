     Unfortunately it's Yet Another Piece of Nonstandard Code that you'd
     have to lug around, and for what?    As a bootstrap loader, it's
     pretty good, but as a kernel helper app to detect memory sizes, it's
     spending a lot of disk space and cpu cycles to do what can be plopped
     in the kernel where it belongs.
