Do you mean hack it for now to return without doing anything (like if
'tz' wasn't valid)?  Or do it farther in the function, like by
changing
				result =
				    acpi_bus_set_power(active->devices.
						       handles[j],
						       ACPI_STATE_D0);
to 
				result = 1;
>  Disable active/passive cooling request before suspend.
Do I need to hack acpi_thermal_passive() as well?
