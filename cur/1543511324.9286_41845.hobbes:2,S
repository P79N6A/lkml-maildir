That's not my approach. Ideally, I'd like to chuck the whole request up
the pipe to mountd. mountd can then either return ESTALE itself or stick
the request back into the kernel's incoming request queue, as it sees fit.
That way, we don't really need the negative export entries, and we don't
drop requests while we're trying to decide whether to authorise a client.
The reason I didn't do this straight away was because it requires rather
fundamental hacking to the RPC layer, to allow mountd to respond on behalf
of nfsd, and to allow mountd to inject requests into nfsd's incoming
queue.

So stick a timeout on the negative entries which gets shorter when there
are more such entries. Or implement what I suggested above.

Timeouts. Now we've got to the concept of the kernel's list as a cache
rather than a definitive list, we can afford just to drop a host from it
when it hasn't made a request for a certain period of time.

There should be a way of selectively disabling the cached entries which
are obsoleted, rather than just trashing the cache entirely.
