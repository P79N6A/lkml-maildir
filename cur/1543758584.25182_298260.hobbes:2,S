That sounds like it should be fixed.

I'd like to see them stay modular if it's not too much trouble.  It makes 
things easier to debug and test, for one thing.  I also think setups with 
multiple framebuffers but w/o consoles on any of them are somewhat common, 
meaning the fb drivers can be easily loaded and unloaded if the fb devices 
aren't in use.
