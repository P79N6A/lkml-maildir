The performance delta between 2.5.62-mjb1 and 2.5.62-mjb2 is caused
by the partial object-based rmap patch (written by Dave McCracken).
I expect this patch to have an increasing impact on workloads with
more processes, and it should give a substantial space saving as 
well as a performance increase. Results from 16x NUMA-Q system ... 
Profile comparison:
before
	15525 page_remove_rmap
	6415 page_add_rmap
after
	2055 page_add_rmap
	1983 page_remove_rmap
(performance of 62 was equivalent to 61)
