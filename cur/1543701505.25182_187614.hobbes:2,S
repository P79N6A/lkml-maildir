I'm not sure, but wasn't this kind of warning moved
from under '-Wall' to under '-W'?
gcc 3.3.2's manpage says:
       -W  Print extra warning messages for these events:
           ...
           o   A comparison between signed and unsigned values
               could produce an incorrect result when the signed
               value is converted to unsigned.  (But don't warn
               if -Wno-sign-compare is also specified.)
