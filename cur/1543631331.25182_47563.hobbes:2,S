Portable code is good practice.

When you look at the kernel codebase its abundantly obvious that its much
more "if its not 32bit with hardware managed caches, little endian, with
no more than one root pci bridge, has a 32/64bit machine word, is byte 
addressed, has sane store ordering rules, conventional not reverse mapped
mmu, machine word sized cache coherency, and no more than 3 level page
tables" and so forth its going to be hard to get it to work well.
A lot of that /dev/port using code is portable to everything from Minix through
most BSD's. It works on pretty much anything with PC style devices.
