That doesn't sound like a good metric. What happens for example if you
have a flakey memory controller or DIMM socket that just occasionally
adds bit errors on transfer without the DIMM actually being bad? I doubt
such a simple heuristic is a good one.
The x86-64 machine check design has a database connected to a user space
program that can keep track of errors. I suspect something like this is
a better solution.

Still at least part of the code should be generic.
Also in general it's good that you finally realized that trying to write
lockless machine check handlers was a bad idea and that to do any
meaninful handling requires a proper process context. But I still wonder
when you move the rest of the ia64 machine check handling to that too so
that e.g. the sched.c hacks for lockless handling can be removed?

It's far too small for it.
