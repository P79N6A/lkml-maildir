does this mean that it won't work if you use the "pci=reverse"?  my only
ide drive hangs off a promise ultra66 card and i've gotten the board 
(an asus p2b-d) to boot off of it... i guess the pci=reverse stuff doesn't
really matter if you just setup the fstab correctly, eh?
oh, is the command to "turn on" dma/66 "idex=ultra66"?  i think i did
something wrong because everytime i boot, i get some complaint about
"wrong kernel option" (i'm not sure what it is exactly -- it's my home
machine and i'm at work now) and the drive looks like it's in pio mode.
btw, am i correct in that your dma/66 patch was not merged into 2.2.12?
thanks,
pete
