Subject: [PATCH] Avoid cache bounce in __d_lookup()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

__d_lookup() sets DCACHE_REFERENCED in d->d_vfs_flags. In the vast
majority of lookups, this bit will already be set. To avoid unecessary
writes, and unnecessarily dirtying and bouncing the cache line
containing d_vfs_flags (which depending on the architecture, can also
contain d_op, and parts of d_name and d_iname) this patch only sets the
bit if it wasn't already set.
d_vfs_flags itself seems a bit of a waste - the only bit used in it
currently is DCACHE_REFERENCED. It might be better to move it to part of
d_flags, which is also mostly unused for local filesystems. But d_flags
appears to be protected by the BKL, rather than the dcache_lock, so the
two sets of bits might be incompatible unless we switched to using
set_bit()/clear_bit() for d_flags.
