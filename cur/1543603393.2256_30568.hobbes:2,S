(i did not criticize the list_add/list_del in any way, it's obviously
correct to cycle the polled devices. I highlited that code only to show
that the current patch as-is polls too agressively for generic server
load.)

(i prefer source code. Can i assume the 'authorative' patch to be the one
with the "goto not_done;" line removed, correct?)

(and the only thing i pointed out was that the patch as-is did not limit
the amount of polling done.)

can you really make it 100% successful for rx? Ie. do you only ever call
the ->poll() function if there is a new packet waiting? How do you know
with a 100% probability that someone on the network just sent a new packet
waiting? (without receiving an interrupt to begin with that is.)
