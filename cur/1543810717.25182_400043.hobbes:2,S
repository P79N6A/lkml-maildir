Subject: 2.6.16-rc4: ATI timer fix doesn't work

On 2.6.16-rc4 I get this message on my Compaq v2312us notebook:
[    0.000000] ATI board detected. Using APIC/PM timer.
But the system clock still runs too fast.  Count for interrupt 0
increments; should it?
I need to use disable_timer_pin_1 to get normal timekeeping.
Shouldn't the message about shaky timers mention that?  And this
is a notebook but I never got that message...
