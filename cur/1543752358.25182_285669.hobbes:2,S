vendor-sec's reputation apparently has been damaged in some circles as
the result of the fake e-matters advisory.  Heise Online also
suggested that the exploit was leaked from vendor-sec ("a natural
conclusion").

CERT/CC shares vulnerability information with anyone who's paying
enough money (read the fine print).  Probably that's not what the
submitters want.

DFN-CERT is certainly honored to be included in this list, but they
can only forward it to security@ at some vendors and probably
vendor-sec.
If you get stuck, asking someone who has published kernel
vulnerabilities previously what to do is also an option.
But in general, there are plenty of options besides trying to contact
just two kernel developers high up the food chain.  Contacting the
subsystem maintainer is often a possiblity, too.  Of course, it's no
good if the subsystem maintainer tells you to post it to a public
list. 8-/
