> Hello all!
> trying to compile kernel I got following:
Use 2.95 or 2.96 not gcc 3.0 if you want a peaceful time of it. If you are
feeling bold and adventurous then 
1.	Get 2.4.6pre5 - this has the compile bug you see fixed (older gcc 
	just missed seeing/reporting it)
2.	Look back in the kernel archives and you'll find some patches for
	the warnings about multi-line string literals in asm blocks
