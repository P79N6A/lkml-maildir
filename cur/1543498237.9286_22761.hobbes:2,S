This is false. I'm not an NT fan, but its rt scheduling algorithms
are similar to Linux. There is a range of priorities that use an
adaptive scheduling algorithm for time-sharing, like linux, and
then a set of priorities higher than that used for real-time scheduling
(like setting your scheduler type to RR of FIFO in Linux). This is all
confused by a set of "priority classes", and some weird scheduling
policies for idle processes, but is not particularly unusual beyond
that.
