Well, lets get some credit to STD... it worked before STR, and it
allowed debugging basic driver infrastructure.

STD needs to snapshot system, and then it needs devices to be
suspended so that snapshot is consistent.

STD worked first ;-). Yes, these days it has little to do with
"suspend", it was mostly separated to "snapshot" and "restore".
We still keep swsusp in kernel for compatibility (and because it makes
debugging very easy).
