I'm just wondering why we have an inconsistency between several archs when
it comes to the definitions of atomic_t, atomic64_t, spinlock_t and their
accessors. Currently we have on most architectures something like
typedef struct { volatile int counter; } atomic_t;
except for i386/x86_64 which has
typedef struct { int counter; } atomic_t;
but then again we have (including x86_64)
typedef struct { volatile long counter; } atomic64_t;
In addition we have
#define atomic_read(v)		((v)->counter)
#define atomic64_read(v)	((v)->counter)
So something like
(1)	while (atomic_read(&v));
May or may not work. Yes, I know it should be
(2)	while (atomic_read(&v))
		cpu_relax();
I'm just wondering about the inconsistency between 32 and 64 bit here and if
(1) is supposed to work or not.
When it comes to spinlock_t we have (on i386):
typedef struct {
	unsigned int slock;
} raw_spinlock_t;
and
static inline int __raw_spin_is_locked(raw_spinlock_t *x)
{
	return *(volatile signed char *)(&(x)->slock) <= 0;
}
Most other architectures have something like this
typedef struct {
	volatile unsigned int slock;
} raw_spinlock_t;
and
#define __raw_spin_is_locked(x)	((x)->slock != 0)
So is
	while (__raw_spin_is_locked(&v));
supposed to work? Or should that be 
	while (__raw_spin_is_locked(&v))
		cpu_relax();
as well and all the volatiles can/should go away?
