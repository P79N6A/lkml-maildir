We do on pSeries. Additionally, another device on the same physical
segment can trigger an error and cause a slot isolation on us even when
we do no IOs, so we also need asynchronous notification.

I think Seto has a good start tho. But it's not enough. See my other
mail to Jeff for my other thought on the issue, I'm still trying to get
some API I'm happy myself with however, since it's not a simple issue.

On pSeries, we'll default, for drivers that don't care, to triggering a
PCI unplug, slot reset, PCI re-plug. This is perfect for ethernet
drivers for example. But it's a real pain for block devices since they
won't be able to recover (and we can't even force unmount the dangling
filesystem afaik).
For drivers like IPR SCSI, we want to expose a richer API so they can
make use of the features provided by the platform, like resetting the
slot.
But the above also need to be able to differenciate a driver that cares
from a driver that doesn't. I think an additional callback in pci_driver
for notifying of async events (error happened, slot has been reset, IOs
are re-enabled, whatever we define ...) is a good idea, since the
presence of a callback is a good enough indication to the core of wether
the driver has it's own recovery strategy or not.
