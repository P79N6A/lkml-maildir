Two problems:
a) It adds yet another reason why person A discovers problems which
   person B cannot reproduce.
b) It adds yet another reason why person A cannot work out the exact
   file-n-line where person B's kernel oopsed.
They are small concerns really, but it does make one wonder why we should
not make this change unconditional: just switch the kernel to -Os?
Does anyone have any (non-micro-)benchmark results which say this is a bad
idea?
