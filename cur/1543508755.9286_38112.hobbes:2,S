[from memory:] The 686 ip checksum routine assumes it is always being
called with a 2-byte aligned buffer in order to optimize away a few
branches. Should it be called with an odd buffer address it may access
(read) an address that's >(buf+len) (it reads the last portion of the
data as a longword). Which could be a problem if that data would be
on another page. But this can _only_ happen if the starting address
of the checksummed buffer is odd, which does not happen. [i looked at
this a while ago and (a) was never able to catch such a case with
an instrumented checksum routine, (b) didn't find any place that 
this could in theory happen. Apparently nobody else either.]
Now, if there is a problem with the checksum routine it's that this
assumption isn't documented properly, that's all.

from my tests further unrolling was a _small_ win when everything was
cached, didn't make much difference with cold caches, and isn't probably
worth it.
Note that the 686 routines _can_ be significanly improved. I think the
snapshot at
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/6494/sw/iackk.tgz
contains my latest version of these routines (+ a few others, incl.
Andrea's, for comparison). IIRC I was able to reduce the cost of
the copy from ~30% to ~5%, and make csum_partial ~15% faster for
small buffers (ie headers). I got somewhat sidetracked and never
commented the code; which i wanted to do before publishing the
patch... Will try to merge with my other checksum changes and
post a patch in a few days.
