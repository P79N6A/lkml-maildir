I agree, and can't imagine the system ever attempting to take this
into account and leave these 5 tasks on the same CPU.
At the other extreme is my observation that 2 tasks on an 8 CPU
system are 'round robined' among all 8 CPUs.  I think having the
2 tasks stay on 2 of the 8 CPUs would be an improvement with respect
to CPU affinity.  Actually, the scheduler does 'try' to do this.
It is clear that the behavior of lat_ctx bypasses almost all of
the scheduler's attempts at CPU affinity.  The real question is,
"How often in running 'real workloads' are the schduler's attempts
at CPU affinity bypassed?".
