With plex86, the goal is to run the stock x86 port.  Plex86 is also
x86-specific.

To get any level of security with UML, you need to use "jailed mode"
in which performance takes a big beating.  To fix this, you need
patches to Linux as a host, to make it offer a better environment
for running UML guests.  From a commercial perspective, then you have
a patched Linux host + totally different port of a Linux guest.
From a fun perspective, I think UML is fantastic achievement.
What I'm aiming for is a stock Linux host and a stock Linux guest,
the small mods to macroize PUSHF/POPF being a minor concession
to accomodate a broken PVI support in x86.
