I made a message to linux-kernel a week ago about the same topic but I
guess it never went though.  I don't know why.  Probably Earthlink's
fault.  Anyways.  Do you happen to be using fbcon?  I don't get these
timeouts unless I am scrolling large text files and playing MP3s at the
same time while in a framebuffer console.  If I'm in a normal text mode
everything is fine.
