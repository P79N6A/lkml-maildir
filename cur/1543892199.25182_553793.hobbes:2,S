I can see your point, given that we just update exec_start in
dequeue_task_rt(). However the situation is slightly more complex in my
patch stack, as I need to update other things during group change. Perhaps
we can postpone this discussion until I post that patch stack.

No, fair_sched_class :: put_prev_task() if we are transitioning from
NORMAL->RT. That will update the fair_clock based on execution time
of current task in fair_sched class?
