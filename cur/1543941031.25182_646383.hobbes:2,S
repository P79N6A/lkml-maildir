No if, it doesn't.
Changing that seems like a slippery rope. Would you want to make it work for
user space addresses then too? It would certainly become
much more heavyweight because it requires much more checks
and then a page table lookup.
For a fairly uncommon case.
I always thought the cheap direct va<->pa conversions to be one of the basic
design principles of the Linux VM. It's surprising you want to throw
that overboard that quickly. 
Better check at least with Linus first, it's a fairly fundamental change.
To be honest IMHO the simplest way to fix this problem would be to just put the 
pgprot_t argument back into __ioremap().  Then you wouldn't have all
these problems.
