Sure, it does. However the human looking at the code is far better at
spotting such problems. Machine-generated warnings are great when the
machine is actually better than human.
Anyway, warnings are one thing and line limit is another. We may raise
the limit leaving the 80-chars warning in place. Unless there are too
many false positives, of course.
