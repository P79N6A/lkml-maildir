Matching at least one occurrence, right?

That may be. My games with strict POSIX sed syntax render busybox's sed
as crap for example. So, you never know.

OK, that means annotations and non ANSI 'inline' thing. Lets see.

* [[:space:]] are more than tab and space isspace(3), is it more
  effective to use [[:blank:]] instead?

substitute one or more ' __user '
> / /g" \
with ' ', everywhere (flag 'g'). So, is it really needed that '\{' thing?

Is it allowed to use identifiers like '__attribute_const__foo' or
__attribute_const__[anything]? If it's not, last line is useless also.

whitespace is allowed   ^ here and is used for better readability
sometimes.
