the 1.0.4 driver used to oops with a simple
ls >/dev/dsp
however, mpg123 seems to work, probably because it explicitly initializes
rate etc. I traced the oops to some function inside the binary-only
object. I don't have an aureal card right now, so I can't test 1.0.5
but the changelog doesn't mention anything which would have fixed this.
so the drivers aren't quite mature yet and it's much more likely to
be a driver problem rather than your motherboard.
