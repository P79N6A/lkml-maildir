Hi,
  today I get this one while attempting to build new kernel. Running kernel is
2.6.0-test11-c1511 (bk as of 2003-12-05 23:35:35-08:00). Does anybody
have any clue what could happen, or should I start looking for a new
memory modules?
  AMD K7/1GHz box, 512MB RAM, no vmmon/vmnet loaded since reboot, gcc-3.3.2
as of last week Debian unstable. Kernel built with all possible memory 
debugging enabled... 
  Unfortunately I have no idea which process did this clone() call, and
whether it succeeded or died. 
					Thanks,
