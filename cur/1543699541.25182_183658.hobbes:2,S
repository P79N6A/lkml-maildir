Do you may mean heavily **over-populated**
/dev? Learning more about devfs would make it
easier to transition to udev. I'm going through this
now for myself.
You could learn how to strip out non-existent
devices from /dev by using
 /etc/devfs/compat_symlinks
by using regular expressions there to make symlinks
for standard device names like udev uses but only
permit devfsd to make device entries for devices
you have on your system.
Here is my /etc/devfs/compat_symlinks. At the
top I don't use anything but devfs naming, then
at the bottom I add a few symlinks both to limit
naming to real devices(see md*) and to make
conventional sd* hd* to make transition to
udev simpler.
