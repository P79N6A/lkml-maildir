Well, we need to write those fbdev drivers, then.

Fix X and/or fbdev, then.

Let the distros catch up with current state of technology....
I mean, it is crazy. We have complex subsystem (graphics), that is
made even more complex because of crazy design (independend fbdev and
DRM, X handling PCI from userspace).
Now, lets take common hardware like radeon. You want these
combinations to be supported:
vgacon 
vesafb ( + unaccelerated X )
radeonfb ( + unaccelerated X )
vgacon + accelerated X
vesafb + accelerated X
radeonfb + accelerated X
vgacon + DRM + accelerated X
vesafb + DRM + accelerated X
radeonfb + DRM + accelerated X
...that's crazy! You claim that for various reasons (mostly bugs) we
need to keep that complexity. That's not the way forward, with
manpower we have I'm afraid.
I believe we can trim supported combinations to half... for hardware
that works anyway. For special cases like intel when some driver is
unavailable /broken, well we may need to do different choices, or
better write missing parts / fix broken cards. I believe that these
combinations make sense:
vgacon 
vesafb ( + unaccelerated X )
radeonfb ( + unaccelerated X )
radeonfb + accelerated X
radeonfb + DRM + accelerated X
That's half of combinations to care about! Plus first two are really
generic across x86...
