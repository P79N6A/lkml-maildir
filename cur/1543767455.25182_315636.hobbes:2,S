This seems like a good place to thank Adrian for his cleaning fetish, 
which makes the kernel code and docs far less confusing, and Jeff, who 
put in most of the effort in documenting bk.
Documentation authors really should mention themselves in the 
introduction, docs aren't sexy and don't get your name in the news, but 
they are a vital part of making Linux usable.
