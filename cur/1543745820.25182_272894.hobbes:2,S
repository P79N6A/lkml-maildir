Subject: [PATCH 2.4] I2C updates for 2.4.28 (4/5)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Two defined constants in include/linux/i2c.h aren't used anywhere,
haven't ever been and won't ever be. They simply don't correspond to
anything in the i2c core. Let's get rid of them.
