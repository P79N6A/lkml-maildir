I think I've got it. 2.4 fails to load DRI, so when X is up there is
memory available until the load of gnucash, the last operation. 2.6
loads dri and probably this eats too much too early, causing the
system to touch swap since the first operation after X startup. This
does not happen anymore disabling DRI in X.
Sorry for wasting your time :(
Thanks.
