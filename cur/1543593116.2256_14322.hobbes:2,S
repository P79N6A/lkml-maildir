I am not sure this fixup is necessary, though IIRC it did solve some
problems.  Since this latest round of Via fixups, I would like to remove
that little change in via audio, and see it anyone complains.
The 686A and 686B docs list no irq after 14.  Adrian Cox has said that
setting the PCI intr line value actually makes a connection on the PIC,
instead of just being a scratchpad register like it is normally.  Adrian
said the same thing about the USB IRQ, and I presume the other internal
irqs (like ACPI) listed for register 0x58 apply as well.
