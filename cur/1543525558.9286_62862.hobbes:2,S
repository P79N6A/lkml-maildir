Why?  So you can log in to your disk drives and run emacs?
If there was some purpose that running Linux on a drive served, it might 
justify and extra $100 cost.  I can't see any purpose to it.  Yes, you could 
telnet into the thing and view your drive geometry, bad sector list, 
statistics, etc.  You don't need to be running a GP/OS on your disk to get 
that information.
I would much rather see that $100 going towards more storage capacity and 
buffering, rather than a CPU running linux.  I think a lot of people would 
agree with me on that one.
