Not exactly.  If "nice" is being (automatically) fiddled to meet some 
measurable requirement such as the amount of CPU tasks get it is no 
longer available as a means for the indication of the relative 
importance of the tasks.  I.e. it can't be both the means for saying 
which tasks should be allocated the most CPU and the means by which that 
allocation is controlled.
