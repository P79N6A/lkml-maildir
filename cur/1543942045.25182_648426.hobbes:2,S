This is indeed another form of value prediction.  Perhaps more common
in scientific applications, but one could imagine it occurring in the
kernel as well.
In some cases, the read from the real r1->next might be deferred until
after the computation so as to overlap the speculative computation with
the memory latency.  Border-line insane, perhaps, but some compiler
folks like this sort of approach...
