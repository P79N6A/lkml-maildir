Well, no, that "guarantee" is fairly badly formulated but I mean "before 
everyone got a SIGTERM" ofcourse. That is, first do the same selection as 
now but don't send KILL but TERM and mark the task as having received a TERM 
already and make it not eligible anymore. Only when there are no TERM 
eligible tasks anymore, start sending KILL.
