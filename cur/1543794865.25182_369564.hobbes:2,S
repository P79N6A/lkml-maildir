No, it doesn't use write-mostly by default. The way raid1 read balancing 
works (in recent kernels) is this:
- sequential reads continue to go to the first disk
- for non-sequential reads, the code tries to pick the disk whose head 
is "closest" to the sector that needs to be read
So even if the reads aren't exactly sequential, you probably still end 
up reading from the first disk most of the time. I imagine with a more 
random read pattern you'd see the second disk getting used.
