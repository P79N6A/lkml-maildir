Tap, tap, is this thing on? ;)
found one related reply from you that i didnt answer yet:
  "As an example, LTTng traces the page fault handler, when kprobes just
   can't instrument it."
but tracing a raw pagefault at the arch level is a bad idea anyway, we 
want to trace __handle_mm_fault(). That way you can avoid having to 
modify every architecture's pagefault handler ...
but the other points remained unanswered as far as i can see.
