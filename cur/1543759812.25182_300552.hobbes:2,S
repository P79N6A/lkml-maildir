"mostly useless" and "completely useless" are two different things.
If you run with nmi_watchdog=0, then this code actually does something
useful, which is what I assume you mean by "mostly useless".  I'm all for
removing useless code, so I'd be fine with just removing the code.  But
something really needs to be done.
Do you want me to submit a patch that simply removes this?
