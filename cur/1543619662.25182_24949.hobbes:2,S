I've been all through this with Joe.  He *does* track pending IO in
device_mapper, and he's got a layered device_mirror driver which can
be overlayed on top of the segments of the device that you want to
copy.  His design looks solid and the necessary infrastructure for
getting the locking right is all there.

There's a copy thread which preallocates a fully-populated kiobuf for
the data.  There's no VM pressure, and since it uses unbuffered IO,
there are no cache coherency problems like current LVM has.
Arjan, I *told* you they have thought this stuff through.  :-)
Cheers,
 Stephen
