IIRC, Intel introduced the cpuid instruction with the DX-100 and Pentiums,
so a 486SX-25 is indistiguishable from any other 486 that doesn't have the
cpuid.  In fact, there is no way to tell it is an Intel even.  Only 486
Cyrixes are identified by the kernel, and that's because they put some
DEVID registers in there from the beginning.  I'm not sure about AMD's, if
we knew for sure that only Intel's 486 didn't have cpuid we could default
to the "GenuineIntel" string, yet I think AMD also made some 486 without
cpuid.  Anybody who knows 486 lore around?
