BTW, I verified this.  Reverting all load-balancing changes fully
restored mysql+oltp peak, and brought mid-range throughput to the same
level as sched_mc=2 except at the log-jam end.  (haven't looked at
vmark, though I'd expect it to be hurting a bit too, it's affinity
sensitive as well)
I expected sched_mc=2 to help an nfs mount kbuild, and it did, quite a
bit.  I first tried an nfs4 mount, but after a while, the odd ipv6 80%
idle problem came back, so I reverted to nfs3.  Full built time there
went from 4m25s to 4m2s.  A nice improvement.
I haven't noticed anything on the interactivity front.
Personally, I'd go for sched_mc=2 as default.  I value the fork/exec
load much more than sensitive benchmarks, though what hurts mysql+oltp
will certainly hurt others as well.  We have a bit of conflict between
keeping CPUs busy and affinity cost.  Something to work on.
