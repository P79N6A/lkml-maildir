	Because you can't force flush/read.  You can't say "I need you
to go to disk for this."  If you do, you're doing O_DIRECT through mmap
(yes, I've pondered it) and you end up with perhaps the same races folks
worry about.  Doesn't mean it can't be done.

	Platter level doesn't matter.  Storage access level matters.
Node1 and Node2 have to see the same thing.  As long as I am absolutely
sure that when Node1's write() returns, any subsequent read() on Node2
will see the change (normal barrier stuff, really), it doesn't matter
what happend on the Storage.  The data could be in storage cache, on
platter, passed back to some other entity.

	remap_file_pages() was indeed somethign Oracle wanted, but as a
way to create 8GB shmfs files and map them into the x86 crappy address
space.  It still does not have the ability to force reads and writes to
the storage, and it even has other issues.
