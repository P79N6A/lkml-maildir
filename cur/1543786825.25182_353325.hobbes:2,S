Subject: Help needed: kernel boot waits for Synaptics TouchPAD for whole minute
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Obviously I have been wasting my time notorically posting this question 
to the linux.kernel newsgroup (about 5-6 times, I guess) until I have 
finally taken a look to the tux org page.However, here is my question 
again and I just hope somebody's gonna post an answer on it:
kernel: 2.6.13 (CPU=P4)
GRUB kernel line: kernel (hd0,4)/boot/bzImage-2.6.13 root=/dev/hda5
vga=0x317 selinux=0 splash=silent resume=/dev/hda2 desktop elevator=as
showopts
On my Gericom Blockbuster notebook kernel waits at boot for whole minute
for Synaptics TouchPad (while SuSE-9.3 packaged kernel (2.6.11) boots
fine). After this minute the kernel boot continues and it works OK
afterwards.
......
ACPI wakeup devices:

ACPI: (supports S0 S3 S4 S5)

md: ... autorun DONE.
RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem).
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program, like XFree86,
might be trying access hardware directly.
Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1, fw: 4.1, id: 0x848a1, caps: 0x0/0x0
input: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio2
after minute or so kernel boot continues:
ReiserFS: hda5: found reiserfs format "3.6" with standard journal
ReiserFS: hda5: using ordered data mode
ReiserFS: hda5: journal params: device hda5, size 8192, journal first
block 18, max trans len 1024, max batch 900, max commit age 30, max
trans age 30
ReiserFS: hda5: checking transaction log (hda5)
ReiserFS: hda5: Using r5 hash to sort names
VFS: Mounted root (reiserfs filesystem) readonly.
Trying to move old root to /initrd ... /initrd does not exist. Ignored.
Unmounting old root
Trying to free ramdisk memory ... okay
....
and smoothly on
I've been googling for some helpful info and found nothing.
Can somebody tell me what to do to et rid of this delay at boot ?
