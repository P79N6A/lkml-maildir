There are systems that care about rlimits and there is strong intersection
between caring about rlimits and user mounts.  Although I do agree that
it looks like we have gotten lazy with the default mount options for
/dev/shm.
Going a little farther any filesystem that is safe to put on a usb
stick and mount automatically should ultimately be safe for unprivileged
mounts as well.
So it looks to me like ultimately most of the common filesystems will actually
be safe for non-privileged mounting.
Regardless this looks like an important discussion as soon as we have the
glitches out of the non-privileged mount code.
