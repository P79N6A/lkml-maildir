Hi !
Do you know if your patch has been included somewhere ?
We have the same problem on a HPCC here with 4 CPUs per MB, and I don't like
playing with taskset (moreover, performance under Windows *much* is better
without any tuning, shame on us), it would be nice to see less migration when
it's not needed...
Cheers,
