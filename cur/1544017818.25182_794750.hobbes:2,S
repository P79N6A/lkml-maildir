Ok, finally bisected the bug, but the commit isn't related to networking!
I did: git revert 4217458dafaa57d8e26a46f5d05ab8c53cf64191
on current git and that fixed the bug.
By the way, how do I undo my git revert, so I'm back to a pristine tree?
I want to drop my changes - the revert.
Also how do I find the commit that merged/pulled in this commit?
