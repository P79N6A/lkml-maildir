My impression is more that there is a big demand for ndiswrapper (look 
e.g. at your download numbers below and some statements in this thread) 
while support for the people developing open source drivers isn't that 
big.

In essency, ndiswrapper is a good excuse for hardware vendors who do not 
want to support the development of open source drivers, because they can 
always tell their costumers "Our hardware is supported by Linux through 
the open source ndiswrapper module".

My personal opinion is that the ability to use unmodified binary-only 
Windows drivers under Linux is really a cool project - and this is meant 
in a 100% positive sense.
But a side effect is a worse open source support for the hardware in 
question.

As I tried to express above, both current end users and hardware vendors 
might like ndiswrapper, but as a side effect there are less and/or worse 
open source drivers.
It partially boils down to the question whether it's better for Linux to 
get as much hardware supported now no matter how, or whether it's better 
to have less hardware supported with good open source drivers and with 
end users putting pressure on hardware vendors to help people developing 
open source drivers.
And there's also the side effect that a poorly written Windows driver 
might crash the Linux kernel. Many end users will attribute such a crash 
to the Linux kernel harming the reputation of Linux as being stable.

It's not the main purpose of my patch to break ndiswrapper, that is a 
collateral damage - but IMHO a positive one.
And we are talking about open source.
You are free to solve the stack problem in ndiswrapper (which might 
already be requierd for some drivers that aren't even happy with the 
current stack limit), or you can tell people to undo my patch or 
whatever.
