Ahh, that wouldn't work at all. The "__test_and_set_bit()" thing isn't 
atomic at all, and no amount of memory barriers around it would help 
(you'd need to use real locking, but at that point the memory barriers are 
pointless anyway).

You still left this one. But never mind - I already edited your original 
patch and it's in my tree with both of those things removed.
