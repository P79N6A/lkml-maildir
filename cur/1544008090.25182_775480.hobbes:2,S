Ok, here you are.
Note that this is for 2.6.29 (not 2.6.28).

Subject: [PATCH] x86: remove ifdef CONFIG_X86_64 in dma_mapping_error
This removes ifdef CONFIG_X86_64 in dma_mapping_error():
1) Xen people plan to use swiotlb on X86_32 for Dom0 support. swiotlb
uses ops->mapping_error so X86_32 also needs to check
ops->mapping_error.
2) Removing #ifdef hack is almost always a good thing.
