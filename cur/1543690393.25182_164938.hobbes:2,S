I just have one quick question about all of this:
People mention that driver interfaces don't change much in stable 
releases, but if memory serves, symbol versioning information changes 
with each minor release, requiring a recompile of modules.
Would it be possible to have a driver module which can be dropped into, 
say, 2.6.17 that can also be dropped into 2.6.18 as long as the 
interface doesn't change?
