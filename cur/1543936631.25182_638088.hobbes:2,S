Fixed, sorry about that.

The driver really isn't intended to cope with them.  As you say, other
boards may have things wired up differently and therefore require
different configuration of the wm97xx and other bits of the system.  The
expectation is that other systems will have their own driver.
My initial thought is that the most straightforward way of handling this
would be to rename the driver to mainstone-wm97xx or similar to make it
clear that the driver is only intended to handle Mainstone as-is.  Does
that seem reasonable?
