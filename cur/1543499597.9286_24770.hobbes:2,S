I did some driver work under Solaris, which does something like this.
Unfortunately, this turns out to be pretty insane for the driver writer
because if something goes wrong with the load of a device module, the
system crashes while various tables (which are stored on disk by solaris)
are in the midst of update.
This is really very evil, and besides I found it to be a hugely overcomplex
web of configuration files and magic. Please, KISS.
I'm all for fixed symbolic links in /dev to ugly names in /devices, and
let ``ln -s'' deal with the devices that stay put (but maybe can be
autoloaded) and let the rest be dealt with as the problems arise, i.e. by
automount, or vold, or some pcmciad, or whatever.
