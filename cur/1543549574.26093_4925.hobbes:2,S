Something I forgot to mention about debugging using screen writes.  If
the problem is caused by incorrect compiler output then even printk can
fail.  Not because the C code is wrong but because the generated
assembler is wrong.  Writing direct to screen memory is as simple as it
gets and gives the compiler little or no chance to get it wrong.
