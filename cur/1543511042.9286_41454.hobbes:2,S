True. In a perfect, constant kernel API world (and constant
distribution vendor-installation API world). It also enables us to
implement a signing method whereby vendors could test and fingerprint
a driver (like active-X).

The issue with this being that Alan and Linus reserve the right
(quite rightly IMHO) to change API's due to brown-bag issues.

If the method were released by the kernel team, it would be adopted
by all vendors (debian, caldera, redhat etc...). Leaving it to each
vendor leaves us open to 1) it not being done (as present) or
2) fragmentation (e.g. HP scanner driver requires Redhat 6.1).
