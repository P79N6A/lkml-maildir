This statement makes no sense.  "link-local ... on all interfaces".
Isn't "link-local" supposed to mean that the address is unique and
available only on that interface (ethernet segment)?  It's possible
to get the _same_ link-local address on multiple ethernet segments,
so in that case, where would you send the packet???  When you send
link-local packets, you must specify the link to which it is local.
