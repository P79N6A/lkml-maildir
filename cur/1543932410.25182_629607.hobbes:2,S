In that case, forget that (dirty) patch completely for now. It does
not break things on Preempt-RT, we only will have a IRQ-1 kernel
thread that is never scheduled. (Of which I think is actually a
irq-manage bug, if there are no handlers that are scheduled on that
thread, it should not even start the thread.)
I will verify/test the complete patchset tomorrow.
Kind Regards,
Remy
