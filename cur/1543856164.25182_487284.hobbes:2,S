Hello all,
I sometimes get this message when I boot kernel 2.6.19. Could this be
related to the BIOS option "USB keyboard support"? When I turn it off I
never get the "handoff failed" message afaik. But I need it to access
lilo. Now I use an USB->PS2 adapter and turn "USB keyboard support" off.
If "handoff failed" and "USB keyboard support" are related wouldn't it
make sense to change the USB error handling?
Regards
Sebastian
