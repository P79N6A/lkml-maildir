When an include file is found using "-I dir", __FILE__ in that include
file is "dir/filename":
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/working-2.5.15-bug/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686   -DKBUILD_BASENAME=delay  -c -o delay.o delay.c
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
