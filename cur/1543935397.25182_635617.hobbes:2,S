Just a bit more maybe-helpful info....
1. The problem appeared in 2.6.21.  2.6.20 works.
2. When the process writing 0 to the 'power' file is hung, running 'ls
/sys/bus/pci/slots/<slotname>' shows an empty directory, i.e. the unlink
of the 'power' file is at least partially complete but the <slotname>
directory remains.
