Please don't do incomplete transitions like that.  We don't really
want people to use kthread_run, but not the kthread stopping
mechanisms, because people will simply forget about that bit and
we'll never get rid of the enormous amount of, erm creativity, in
handling kernel thread stopping.
This is just the first patch in your series where the thread is mutable,
but it equally applies to all following patches where this is the case
aswell.
