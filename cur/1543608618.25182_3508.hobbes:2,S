We could add a file into /proc like /proc/processes that contains once
all process informations that some programs like top or ps can read only
Once.
It could save a lot of time in kernel mode scanning the process list for
each process.
later, a new version of ps or top could simply stat /proc/processes and
if it exists uses it to give informations to the user.
What do you think of this idea ?
