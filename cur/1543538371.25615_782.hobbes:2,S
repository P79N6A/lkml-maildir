Tim,
If you want to help coding rather than just debugging then please feel free 
to have a look at the rather large amount of fixmes in the code... - And 
they are not everything that needs doing either. - I am too busy at the 
moment but I am going to be on holiday towards the third third of the month 
so I was thinking of doing some cleaning-up then. If I actually get 
something done you are welcome to try the results and debug the bugs.

Jeff,
Don't worry about my last name. - Even I have problems when having to spell 
it out without seing it written down, especially in English... (-;

That would be great. More so since you seem to be the only person who 
actually has the ms ntfs specs and hence the only person who actually knows 
what the on-disk structures are... - The information I have at least is 
gathered from various books and sources and is not quite complete or may 
very well be wrong in places.
