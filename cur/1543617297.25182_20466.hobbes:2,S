You are right: I think however "preemption" is part of
a package of ideas about how the system should work. 
So it would probably be better to separate these issues out

If you would write this as 
	Another way of looking at preemption is that it is intended
	to enable a more responsive ...
then we would be off to a good start in narrowing the discussion.

clear benefits.
