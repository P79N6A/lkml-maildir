That may be true, but I believe Con is attempting to err on the side
of caution in saying that swap prefetch should have practically no
negative impact if _anything_ is running. (The whole premise, for now,
anyways, is that swap prefetch should provide... "something for
(almost) nothing", if I'm interpreting this right.)
That said, there are probably some cases (seti) where swap prefetch
during the run of that batch program would help. On the flip side,
there are also some cases where batch processes (various other
seti-like "boinc" apps) which use a good deal of memory, meaning that
performing the prefetch at that time is futile, unhelpful, or
otherwise unwanted.
Would it be better to be less yield-y in this circumstance?
