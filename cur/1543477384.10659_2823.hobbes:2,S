I am using a MediaGX 233mmx and when I am downloading & accessing the
disk the download always times out.
Like, in netscape communicator for example, after I download my email
from the mailing list and (while downloading a file or serving ip
masquerading)open the screen with the list of mail it does about 4
seconds of disk access; the ppp device's transfer will just sit there
doing nothing until the disk acces if finished.
I can't compile anything while downloading or the download will fail.
Maybe its just that this crummy media gx can't do 2 things at once.
I'm using Kernel 2.2-pre6-ac1 and it has been happening since at least
2.1.135 I don't remember if it did it in the 2.0 kernels
If there is anything else you need, like my .config file of something,
please tell me.
Does anybody else have a problem like this?
Thanks,
Jon
