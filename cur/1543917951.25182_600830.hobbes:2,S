Yeah, I read those threads.
It seems like the fundamental source of the disconnect is that the tasks 
used to be sorted by priority (thus making it easy to bump a yielding 
task to the end of that priority level) while now they're organized by 
time (making it harder to do anything priority-based).  Do I have that 
right?
