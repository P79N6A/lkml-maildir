There is a certain need for this kind of patches.
I have seen similar stuff for the blind, or for disabled
people who for example can use only one hand.
Also for people who use a combined keyboard/barcode reader.
Hooks for drivers that do something special have other uses
than for proprietary extensions.
It is good to see what people want.
One of these centuries we must replace the present keyboard
and console stuff, probably by something very similar to
Vojtech's input device stuff, and we must make sure that
the new code is powerful enough to last for a few years again.
