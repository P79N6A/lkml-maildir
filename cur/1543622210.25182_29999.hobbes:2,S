Exceptions provide implicit handling. You should see tham as an alternate
return path. And because of that implicitness, it is not syntactic sugar.
However, one thing which your example does emphasize, it the risk of
resource leaks. Bjarne Stroustrup, who is no mean architect himself, spends
a lot of pages discussing those leaks.
Basically, an exception may fall through several functions before being
caught. Any resources acquired by those intermediate functions will not be
released unless this is done automatically during stack unwinding, ie,
destroctors or alloca(3).
So while having an alternate return path is cool, it really needs
destructors in order to be useful in a real world. 
This url documents the problem, which is solved by adopting the 'Resource
Acquisition is Initialization' paradigm:
