 I'm not quite sure if that's forbidden by MPS -- the mixed mode certainly 
is not as not all interrupt sources may necessarily be routed to one of 
I/O APICs, and "noapic" can probably be treated as a special case of the 
mixed mode.  Regardless, there used to be systems in existence that 
wouldn't route IRQ 0 to an I/O APIC, so using that interrupt requires 
either the mixed mode or using the "through-i8259A" trick (which 
unfortunately does not work for a subset of affected systems as a result 
of manufacturers implementing the Intel-recommended glue logic at the 
output of the master i8259).
