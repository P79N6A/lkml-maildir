hmmmm, scrollback doesn't currently _do_ anything.
But the messages didn't scroll there, they just appear (as the memory is 
restored I assume). The same messages appear during the fail-to-suspend case too.

So I've since removed DISABLE_CONSOLE_SUSPEND=y
Should I put it back?
I was actually doing the netconsole anyway - but skge is currently a module - 
I've avoided making any changes to the config during all these tests but what 
the heck...
And wouldn't you know it.
Get netconsole working (ie new kernel with skge builtin) and I get the hang on 
suspend. Here's the netconsole output...
swsusp: Basic memory bitmaps created
Stopping tasks ... done.
Shrinking memory... done (0 pages freed)
Freed 0 kbytes in 0.03 seconds (0.00 MB/s)
Suspending console(s)
Given that moving something from module to builtin changes the behaviour I 
thought I'd bring these warnings up again (Andrew or Alan mentioned similar 
warnings being problems in another thread...)
Now, I have mentioned these before but there's been a lot going on so here you go:

PS Gotta go - back in a couple of hours - let me know if there are any more 
tests to try.
