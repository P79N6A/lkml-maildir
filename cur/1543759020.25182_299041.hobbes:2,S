Why should there be one? One of the things I like about this concept is
that it's just a moving tree. There could be daily snapshots like the
-bkX "releases" of Linus's tree, if there are changes from the day
before. It means (hopefully) that no one will "wait for x.y.z.2 because
that is really stable".
