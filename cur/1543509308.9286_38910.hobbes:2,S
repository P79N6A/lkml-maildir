The AMD7390 and DBRI audio drivers in 2.2.13-pre7 don't compile, because they 
attempt to use header files from the isdn code which no longer exist:
sparc /usr/src/linux/drivers/sbus/audio # gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -m32 -pipe -mno-fpu -fcall-used-g5 -fcall-used-g7 -DMODULE   -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c amd7930.c
amd7930.c:108: ../../isdn/hisax/foreign.h: No such file or directory
By commenting out the ISDN support from the offending file, I can get it to 
compile and work for audio. I have no idea about the ISDN support, though.
The ISDN code now appears to contain its own support for the AMD7390, but it 
gives no indication whether it will coexist nicely with the audio driver or 
not.
