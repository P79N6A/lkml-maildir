Hold on, there's more :)
/1/
$ cd ~ && rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build
$ export KBUILD_SRCTREE_000=/usr/src/linux-2.5.13
$ export KBUILD_OBJTREE=$PWD
$ alias M="make -f $KBUILD_SRCTREE_000/Makefile-2.5"
$ touch foo bar baz
$ M mrproper
spec value %p not found
$ ls foo bar baz
/bin/ls: foo: No such file or directory
/bin/ls: bar: No such file or directory
/bin/ls: baz: No such file or directory
$ # oh my! wherez mah precious files gone!
--> *BUUUURN*
/2/
$ cd ~ && rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build
$ cp /lib/modules/2.5.13/.config .
$ M oldconfig installable
...
--> kbuild repeats launching "oldconfig" till I hit C-c,
never proceeds to "installable".
Of course, issuing "M oldconfig && M installable" works.
