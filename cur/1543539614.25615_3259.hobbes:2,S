X does, however DOSemu does not need direct access necessarily.  
It depends on how it is configured, and what you need it to do.
VMware creates a virtual hardware environment which is
implemented by talking to linux device drivers.  No linux driver,
no hardware in VMware.  I do not believe VMware touches the
hardware directly for anything, at least not according to them.
I just wanted to clear this up (hopefully correctly) because
people might not want to use Vmware for fear of hardware access,
which doesn't happen.
