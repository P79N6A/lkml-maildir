stty speed -F /dev/ttyXY
The setserial spd_* options can affect speed but they are obsolete so you
shouldn't be using them. If stty says 38400 then the setserial spd_* is in
effect. If spd_normal, then 38400 means 38400. If spd_hi, then 38400 means
57600. If spd_vhi, then 38400 means 115200. If spd_shi, then 38400 means
230400. If spd_warp, then 38400 means 460800. Then there's spd_cust, which is
more weird.
