The kernel isn't there to protect people. It's there to provide
functionality.

You're suggesting that users who are technically competent to compile
their own kernel and write their own initrd scripts are unable to deal
with checking whether or not a filesystem is mounted? You don't need an
application to do that, it's a simple matter of shell scripting. And, in
almost every case, if something is a simple matter of shell scripting it
shouldn't be in the kernel.
