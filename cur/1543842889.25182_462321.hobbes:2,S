When I meant a default container I meant a default "resource group". In
case of container that would be the default environment. I do not see
any additional overhead associated with it, it is only associated with
how resource are allocated/accounted.

note that the resource available to the default RG will be (total system
resource - allocated to RGs).

You _will_ have limits for the default RG even if we don't have
guarantees.

Not really. 
 - Each RG will have a guarantee and limit of each resource. 
 - default RG will have (system resource - sum of guarantees)
 - Every RG will be guaranteed some amount of resource to provide QoS
 - Every RG will be limited at "limit" to prevent DoS attacks.
 - Whoever doesn't care either of those set them to don't care values.

As I stated in an earlier email "Limit only" approach can prevent a
system from DoS attacks (and also fits the container model nicely),
whereas to provide QoS one would need guarantee.
Without guarantee, a RG that the admin cares about can starve if
all/most of the other RGs consume upto their limits.
