That wasn't my point.
What I'm trying to get away from is this passing of full pathnames into and
out of the kernel, whether by syscall or ioctl.  It is a poor interface
and, less importantly, is slow.
And it is slow on the common (notify) path!  It's worth adding additional
setup overhead if we can make he event delivery faster, no?

There's probably not a lot of difference, even if all those pathnames and
inodes are in cache.
