Really?
tar and cp still need to be taught about them.  And if they are not taught
they will do the wrong thing and hard link the files removing the
copy on write semantics.  Which would do ugly thing when you restore
from your backup.
I don't have a problem with the inode number changing when you write to
a file, because I can't think of much that would care either way.
But having the inode number of an open file change sounds like a very
difficult problem to track. 
Maybe aiming cow links at things like a live cd filesystem is too
ambitious, but it sounds like a minimal clean way to handle all of
the dependencies on writeable files that show up.
