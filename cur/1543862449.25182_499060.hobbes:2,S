All the testing was done via a ssh into the workstation.  The console
was left as booted into, with the gdm running.  The remote nfs4
directory was mounted on "/mnt".
After copying the 60+ GB and testing that the keyboard was still
functioning, I did not reboot but stayed in the same kernel and pulled
the latest git then started bisecting.  After recompiling, I moved
over to the workstation to reboot it, but the keyboard was not
functioning ;(
I ran "lsusb" and it displayed all the devices. "dmesg" did not show
any oops, anything for that matter.  I have unplugged the keyboard and
run "lsusb" again, but it hang.  I ran "ls /mnt" and it hang as well.
Stracing "lsusb" showed it hang (entered the kernel) at opening the device
that used to be the keyboard.  Stracing "ls /mnt" showed that it
hang at "stat(/mnt)".  Both processes were in "D" state.  "ls /root"
worked without problem, so it appears that crossing mountpoints causes
some hang in the kernel.
Based on this info, I think we can rule out any USB.  I will try
testing with NFS3 to see if the problem persists.  Unfortunately there
is no oops or anything in "dmesg".
