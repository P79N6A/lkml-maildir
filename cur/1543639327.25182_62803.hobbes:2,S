It's certainly a kernel bug. This machine has been reliable for years with
stable kernels and I started to run the 2.5 series over the last couple
of days just to test out the softirq stuff (+ preempt) and latency. I
applied Mingo's patch for a recent scheduler assertion bug and it looks
like some kind of race is possibly happening in the IDE layer.
And Mingo, yes, the patch you sent me did help, but it looks like there's
other problems.
Thanks
