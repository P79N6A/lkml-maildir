All "dumb" SCSI drivers have this problem, USB storage is just one of
them. This would also allow to remove bounce buffering that some
non-dumb ones are doing in fact.
There's another solution jejb was talking about involving reworking the
allocation of the sense buffer to make it always under driver control
etc... but that's the kind of SCSI surgery that I'm not prepared to do
especially not for .25 and without much HW to test with.

How is that a problem ? The annotation will make sure the buffer doesn't
share cache lines. It forces alignmenet before and pads after.
