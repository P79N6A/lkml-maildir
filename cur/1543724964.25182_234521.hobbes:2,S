???  C does not require ordering of function _implementations_, except 
for this gcc brokenness.
The above example allows one to do what one normally does with 
non-inlines:  order code to enhance readability, and the compiler will 
Do The Right Thing and utilize it in the best way the CPU will function.
Just because you stick a modifier on a function doesn't mean it's time 
to stop using C as it was meant to be used :)
