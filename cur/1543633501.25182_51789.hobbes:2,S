So you want to leave this hole sitting there waiting for someone else
to step in it, until gcc gets fixed?  I'd think a bug report would be
a more effective solution than holding one's breath until blue in the
face.
I don't have a problem with fixing this at the interface to gcc level,
as then it's fixed definitively for the whole kbuild system.  I do have
a problem with just changing the names of files that trigger the bug,
that's sloppy beyond the belief and it's the stuff that substandard
systems are made of.
