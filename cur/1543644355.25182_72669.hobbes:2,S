given that the existing code uses self-modifying-code for the safe-points
i'm guessing there are so many safe-points that the above if statement
would be excessive overhead (and the save/flag/wait stuff would probably
cause a huge amount of code bloat -- but could probably be a subroutine).
there was some really interesting GC work i heard about years ago where
the compiler generated GC code along-side the normal executable code.
the GC code understood the structure of the function and could make much
better choices of GC targets than a generic routine could.  when GC needs
to occur, a walk up the stack in each thread executing the
routine-specific GC stubs would be performed.  (given just the stack
frames you can index into a lookup table for the GC stubs... so there's no
overhead when GC isn't occuring.)  i don't have a reference handy though.
anyhow, this is probably getting off-topic :)
