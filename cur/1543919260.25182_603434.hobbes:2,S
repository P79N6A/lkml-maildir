ghhrm.  That's nonsense.  I found where that struct super_block come
from -- it's from unionfs patches for 2.6.22, which I forgot to
update for 2.6.23 (I just dropped new kernel tarball into my
build directory together with other patches and ran usual build
procedure).  It's a definitely false alarm - the tarball is
fine.
