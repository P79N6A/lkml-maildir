Well, looks like I know where is the problem. You have 64 MB of RAM, and
shadow RAM is enabled in BIOS setup. So Linux kernel sees just 65528k of
memory (which is < 64Mb). When my patch tris to determine memory size in
Mb, it gets 63. Because write allocate is enabled for 64 != 63 Mb memory,
it tries to re-enable write allocate. Write allocate can be enabled only in
4Mb chunks, so it can enable write allocate only for 60Mb of memory.
I can fix this, but I have two options:
(1) Do not re-enable write allocate if it's already enabled for memory
size >= memory, available for kernel (= now) - maybe with the warning
(2) Try to determine physical memory size and re-enable write allocate if
and only if it's not enabled for this memory size - maybe with warning
about shadow memory.
What to do?
P.S. Turning shadow memory off probably will fix the problem. (Write
allocate should not be re-enabled int his case. You'll see just first
message: "Write allocate is enabled for 64 MB of memory".) Could you try
this for me, please?

This is a message. Or something silly like that.
