Well, that would work in sort of preventing a complete lockup, but the
watchdog wouldn't even know if the task eating lots of CPU is privileged
(OK) or unprivileged (not OK). Also, the original RLIMIT_RT_CPU feature
allowed you to really control how much CPU is available to unprivileged
users, not just prevent them from getting 100% CPU.
