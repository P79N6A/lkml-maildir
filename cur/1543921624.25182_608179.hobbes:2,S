There's been a patch to add the /dev/toshiba functionality floating
around for at least a year or two. Is there a reason it hasn't already
been applied?
I'm not entirely convinced that userland is the right way to do this
though. In the long run rfkill appears to be the correct generic
infrastructure, but at present it's not able to cope with devices that
don't exist when switched off and I can't find any other users in
mainline anyway. Assuming that changes, would you accept a patch adding
support for it to toshiba-acpi?
