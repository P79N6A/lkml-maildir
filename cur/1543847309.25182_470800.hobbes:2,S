Hmm, the retry should be gone - it was only there for the
seqlock-ish truncate race code.

It keeps the 'nopage_page' around and unlocks it at the end.
Last time I looked, this is required because truncate wants to
unmap 'even_cows', so we must hold the pagecache page locked
while instantiating the mapping on the cow page.

It does a conditional lock if !VM_CAN_INVALIDATE based on a
suggestion from Hugh. I don't disagree with that, but it can
go away in the next patch as we won't be calling into
->page_mkwrite (if that callback can be implemented with ->fault).
