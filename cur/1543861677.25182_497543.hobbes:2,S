Namespace unification doesn't seem to fit into neither vfs-only nor fs-only
category. My guess is that some of the code that's currently in unionfs
could be replaced by some vfs-level magic.

And is a VFS implementation the right way to do it?

I think it would "increase" the chance of people doing the right thing -
whatever it may be.

Many people are currently using the full - lkml-unsafe :) version of the
code which has a considerable amount of bells and whistles - at least
compared to the minimal version submitted. I want to take the good things
"port" them over and make sure everything is good.
