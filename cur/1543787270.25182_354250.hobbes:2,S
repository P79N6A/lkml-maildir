Even if nr_reclaimable isn't going to zero, eventually the loop should
break out because pages_written must increase.
So this make me think it might be the nr_unstable that destabilizes it,
and whatever it is, it is a bug in mainline as well, except it was well
hidden until now, because the dirty levels never approached zero during
heavy write-IO like it can happen with this feature enabled.
Basically whatever we account as "reclaimable" must be _written_out_ and
accounted as well in the "pages_written" otherwise it'll just hang. 
If there's a problem, it shall be a longstanding one.
Can you try with this new patch that stops accounting "unstable" as
"reclaimable". It should be possible to flush the dirty pages to disk so
"nr_dirty" should be safe because they should always increase the
"pages_written". I'm not sure if this fixes it, but this at least rule
out the nfs from the equation (perhaps nfs will never be accounted as
"pages_written" and that would be a possible explanation of the infinite
loop).
This new update also makes sure to never account rewrites (except for
reiserfs where it's more difficult to change the code for this).
I tried with fsx (no params) but I couldn't reproduce any problem yet,
but I've no nfs workload involved in my test box.
