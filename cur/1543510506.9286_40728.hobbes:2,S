Thanks for your response, sorry it's taken a few days to get back to you,

Tried this, and a few others including disabling SACK, but because I was remote 
to the site and the tester was not of the highest calibre, the results where 
not conclusive.... Hope to conduct more accurate tests early next week when I'm 
onsite at one of the offending networks

Of course, and I'll certainly summarise how the problem is resolved to wherever 
is appropriate (recommendations?) , I've received another response from Alan 
Cox (gosh!), and replied to the mailing list as well...

Thanks very much for the kind offer, I have attached a tcpdump produced by 
'tcpdump host thames and host spider1' where 'thames' is the RH 6.0 box and 
'spider1' the Shiva Terminal Server... Can'tmake much of it myself, but I'm 
looking at it now as well, if this is not specific or detailed enough please 
let me know (if you're still willing to look at it of course)

Once again thanks very much for your help so far
