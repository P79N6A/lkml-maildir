The ppc has a different interrupt architecture, it has only a single
interrupt entry and a single interrupt priority (on/off). In that file
there is also a mask_and_ack_irq(irq) _before_ that loop. The m68k cpu is
completly different here, it has multiple entries and multiple priorities
(0-7) and the acknowledgement needs sometimes also to be done within that
loop by the driver, so it doesn't work anymore.
The requirement for a sti() in interrupts makes it impossible to utilize
these priorities to achieve better interrupt perfomance. What other people
sometimes would like to have - the ability to preempt slow interrupts -
get we for free implemented in hardware, but we can't use it because of
the above requirement. :(
bye, Roman
