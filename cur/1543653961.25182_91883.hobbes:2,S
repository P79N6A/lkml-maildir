This (and -mm1) does not boot for me. Or rather, the kernel boots
but the systems hangs hard when kdm starts. No numlock, no sysrq.
Only hard reboot helps. 
I can boot single-user fine. And I can boot X fine from a
single-user root login. KDE then hangs, but X definitely starts.
I can terminate X at this point with crtl-alt-backspace.
My system is a Debian testing, X is 4.2.1. The kernel has no DRI
support configured, no SMP, has preempt. Machine is P3-450, 128MB 
RAM.
2.5.47mm1 works fine. My 2.5.49 .config is at 
www.jaquet.dk/kernel/config-2.5.49
