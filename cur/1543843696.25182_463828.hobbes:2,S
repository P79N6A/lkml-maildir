No, that's my point, it's not an "implementational issue" of static 
tracers, the overhead of markups for static tracers is:
   _inherent to their concept of being compile-time and static_

your characterization of "the point" is at odds with the specific point 
that we are discussing - see the underlined sentence above, right at the 
top of the quotes:

Please either concede the point or dispute it, before shifting to new 
grounds. Thanks,
