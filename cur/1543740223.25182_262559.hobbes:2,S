It could be the wakeup GPE issue, but must note Pavel's system suffer
the problem even with acpi=off. Could you please try boot your system
with acpi=off, and then reboot with acpi=off, what's the result? I
expected the wakeup GPE is disabled by the BIOS in this case.
Anyway, the DSDT can tell us the wakeup GPE info.
