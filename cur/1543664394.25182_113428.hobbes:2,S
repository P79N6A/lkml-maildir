02 is "Receive Checksum Error", and it's explained both in apic.c
and in Intel's IA32 Volume 3 manual.
This is almost certainly a hardware problem: your machine's APIC bus
is corrupting messages, or some other agent than the CPU is creating
corrupt messages. This isn't exactly unheard of for non-Intel chipsets.
Disable IO_APIC support and you should be fine. If you still get these
errors, you'll have to either live with them or disable UP local APIC
support as well.
