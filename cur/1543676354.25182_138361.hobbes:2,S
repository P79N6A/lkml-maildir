Why can't you send driver updates to lkml first?  The rocket.c
update backs out at least the check_region fixes an possibly
more.  Instead of sending small incremental patches you slap
in a monster patch that ignores what was there before and does
silly things like massive cpp abuse.  Also when you change
the pci probing please make it use a new-style pci driver, etc..
The driver already was a mess and you made it even worse.
