Hi all, running a Libretto L2 (ACPI only) on which I've been trying to 
get suspend working for ages.  My latest try was 2.5.63 with the 
20030228 ACPI update patch.
S3 powers down into sleep mode, and upon awakening, prints
        Linux!
in yellow text and hangs.
S4 starts putting processes in the refrigerator, and hangs on the last 
line (which just says "=|" IIRC).
Any ideas?  I can supply system info and kernel config info if 
helpful.
Thanks,
eric
