Debian has a bug track system which interacts mainly with the users
through email.  Seems rather nice to use and doesn't make you sign up to
submit things, and has no issues with mailing lists being "subscribed"
to a bug.  Probably a bit complicated to setup though.

So in other words, basically the debian bug track system, except
perhaps with an ability to submit bugs through a web interface too
rather than just email and reportbug (which I believe uses email).
