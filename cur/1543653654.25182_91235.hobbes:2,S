On x86 systems in general the full cache sizes are always used.  It's
enabled in the hardware/BIOS, so there should be no problem there.
The only thing it might do is change any optimizations the Linux kernel
is trying to make to optimize for the cache size.  The only one I'm
aware of at the moment is the weighting algorithm when running in SMP
(i.e. how hard to fix a process to a particular processor in order to
take best advantage of the cache footprint).
