Capabilities themselves are already written into the kernel, and I
currently am just assuming that the code for propogating capabilities
through an 'exec' is already in there.  What remains is to store the three
capability sets for each executable in the filesystem in a secure way. The
right (and future) way to do this is through new filesystem metadata. What
I am proposing gives us a logical equivalent, but is immediately
compatible with all current tools, and in it's current incarnation appears
very secure (Eric Biederman having solved the older kernel problem).  The
remaining problem is with networked filesystems, which, by guaging some
opinions, shouldn't hold capability-enabled binaries in any case.

Our ad-hoc solutions merely give us the filesystem component of a
capabilities-based system.  User space tools need some work, but can
operate in this system quite nicely by merely being capability enabled.
Take 'tar' for instance; leave it's 'permitted' bits 0, and raise (at a
minimum) CAP_SETFCAP in it's inheritable set.  Then, it may be that at
login the authenticated user gets a bash shell with CAP_SETFCAP raised in
it's inheritable set, thereby allowing that user (security-officer?) to
unpack a .tar.gz and preserve caps.  A normal user unpacking should
produce non-capability-enabled binaries.  Similar techniques apply to cp,
et. al, and IMHO are right-on with true capability support.
