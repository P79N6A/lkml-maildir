As a non-kernel-hacker, I also had to work out what the [block,char]-major-xx
things
were. I discovered that they relate to attempts to load handlers for the
/dev/xxxx entries.
Often in /etc/conf.modules (or /etc/modules.conf depending on your setup)
there are a list
of alias block-major-xx nnnnn and alias char-major-xx nnnn entries commented
out.
If you find the relevant one, then you can try un-commenting it to see if
that helps.
Alternatively, try the following...
cd /dev
ls -l | grep "xx, "
(where xx is the number you are referring to, and there is a space after the
comma)
this will tell you which devices use that major number.
I had this problem with "char-major-4" which turns out to be the ttySx
devices.
Thus, go into /etc/conf.modules and add a new alias like
alias char-major-4 serial
if you use serial as a module, or
alias char-major-4 off
if you compile it in (this stops complaints I think)
I hope this helps
Dan
