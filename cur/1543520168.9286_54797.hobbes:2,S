Does this one-liner make any difference?
Basically, I'm looking for differences in interrupt-masking
behaviour for UP+PIO from 2.2.13 to 2.2.14pre15, and this 
on-liner is one of the few.  Maybe the right one.
The rationale for this approach is that we *know* that "hdparm -u1"
fixes the problem, so we know it's something to do with unmasking
a little too much in some cases that triggers it.
And your scenario is really simple -- single drive on a single interface,
no IRQ multiplexing or anything weird (other than your old hardware).
Thanks
