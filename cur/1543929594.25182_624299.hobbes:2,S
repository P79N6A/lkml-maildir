That is what I like of C++, with good placement of high level features
like const's and & (references) one can gain fine control over what
gets copied or not.
Try to write a Vector class that does ops with SSE without storing
temporals on the stack. Its a good example of how one can get low
level control, and gcc is pretty good simplifying things like u=v+2*w
and not putting anything on the stack, all in xmm registers.
The advantage is you onle has to be careful one time, when you write
the class.
