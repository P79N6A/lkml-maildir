I always google for the PCI IDs which lspci -n shows.

We already do have such a program, it's called /sbin/hotplug. The missing
piece for your scheme, however, is that the maps which govern hotplug are
generated from C files. Therefore, the code is patched to add new IDs.
AFAIK, Greg Kroah worked on a more configurable way to match drivers with
devices within the hotplug framework. You might want to talk to Greg
about this.
By the way, Greg is a Gentoo developer as well, but pleas keep this to
a common forum. I'm sure folks from other distros are be interested.
Jaa ne,
