Hi Komal,
The driver needs to handle failures in input_register_device() and
unwind initialization properly. Also you do not need to do double
negation of the value when calling input_report_key() because it will
do it for you.
Also you might consider setting up keycodetable, keycodesize, etc in
the input device - this way you can change keymap at runtime via
ioctls.
