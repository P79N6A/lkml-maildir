I'd disagree. We have a load of stuff in linux/Documentation/*. What's there
is pretty good, the problem is the stuff that's missing. I'm sure patches from
you to add stuff to that directory would be welcomed.

Well, yes, pretty obvious to most people I think. I've actually dug up the
linux-kernel FAQ, and it does define what a 'production kernel' is. Of course,
if your patch fixes a bug in the stable kernel, then I'm sure it would be
considered.

Ish. The prefered format for patches is mentioned in the (ancient) copy of
the lkml FAQ I'm looking at. The "MAINTAINERS" file in the root of the source
tarball describes pretty accurately a good process for creating, testing and
submitting patches.

I'm not sure what you mean by "kernel-centric". This is the kernel mailing
list, of course patches are going to focused on the kernel, we don't do
anything else here..

To a certain extent, yes, in as far as those areas create their own mailing
lists and web pages. Is that a problem?

Anything that's not focused on the kernel is off-topic. Hence the name of
the list..

A lot of people use some sort of source control privately though. And Larry
McVoy has been working very hard to produce a distributed source control
system that meets Linus' requirements. Anybody's free to use CVS to keep
the kernel source code, and I believe DaveM and the Sparc people do so. Linus'
won't because he doesn't want to. I don't see anyone has the right to tell him
how he should manage his tree.
