  misc_register() in drivers/char/misc.c seems to have a problem.
 int misc_register(struct miscdevice * misc)
 {      
        static devfs_handle_t devfs_handle;
-               
+       struct miscdevice *c;
+               
        if (misc->next || misc->prev)
                return -EBUSY;
        down(&misc_sem);
+       c = misc_list.next;
+               
+       while ((c != &misc_list) && (c->minor != misc->minor))
+               c = c->next;
+       if (c == &misc_list) {
  This should be  (c != &misc_list)
+               up(&misc_sem);
+               return -EBUSY;
+       }
