Given the existence of shared subtrees allowing/denying this at the mount
namespace level is silly and wrong.
If we need more than just the filesystem permission checks can we
make it a mount flag settable with mount and remount that allows
non-privileged users the ability to create mount points under it
in directories they have full read/write access to.
I don't like the use of clone flags for this purpose but in this
case the shared subtress are a much more fundamental reasons for not
doing this at the namespace level.
