I never ever tried to say _everything_ must be driven by events.
IO must be driven, it is a must IMO.
Some (and a lot of) things can easily be programmed by threads.
Threads are essentially for those tasks which can not be easily
programmed with events.
But have in mind that fact, that thread execution _is_ an event itself, 
its completion is an event.
