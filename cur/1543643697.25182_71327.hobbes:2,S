Guys, 
When dd is told to skip a certain number of input blocks it doesn't
seek past them, but reads them and then discards them. Thus if you're
not supposed to read sectors 1-100 then this will not work. 
Try the following program: 
/* seek.c (C) R.E.Wolff@harddisk-recovery.nl */
/* 
	gcc -Wall -O2 seek.c -o seek 
*/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#ifndef O_LARGEFILE
#define O_LARGEFILE     0100000
#endif
long long lseek64 (int fd, long long offset, int whence);
int main (int argc,char **argv)
{
  long long off;
  long long tt;
  if(argc < 2)
        exit(0);        /* don't seek at all */
  if (strncmp (argv[1],"0x",2) )
    sscanf (argv[1],"%Ld",&off);
  else
    sscanf (argv[1],"%Lx",&off);
  if (argc > 3) {
    if (strncmp (argv[3],"0x",2) )
      sscanf (argv[3],"%Ld",&tt);
    else
      sscanf (argv[3],"%Lx",&tt);
    if (argv[2][0] == '+')
      off += tt;
    else
      off -= tt;
  }
  
  errno = 0;
  if ((lseek64 (0,off,SEEK_CUR) < 0) &&
      (errno != 0))
    perror ("seek");
  exit (0);
}
with the command: 
	dd if=/dev/sda of=firstpart 
(Get the partition table)
	(seek 0x100000;dd of=secondpart) < /dev/sda 
Get everything beyond 1Mb. If this works, then we have to figure out
how low we can make the "0x100000" number to get all of the data.
Hypothesis: The partition table specifies that the data starts
on sector 200, and they didn't implement sectors 1-199.....
Cheap basterds. 
(My memory stick is just over 128 * 10^6 bytes, and not even
close to 128 * 2^20 bytes....)
