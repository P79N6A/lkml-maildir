I found the discussion, and Christoph's e1000e sounds like the best name 
("new" doesn't say whether it's a new driver for old hardware or a 
driver for new hardware).

No problem for me, but this obviously implies that global code in the 
new driver has to be renamed.
And please ensure that they will always support distinct PCI IDs, or 
there will be the following common pattern if both drivers support
a card:
- user tries driver A
- driver A doesn't work (although it should have worked)
- user tries driver B
- driver B works
- a later kernel removes support for this card from driver B
- user tries driver A
- driver A still doesn't work
- user writes bug report
Users should report bugs early instead of bouncing between different 
drivers.
