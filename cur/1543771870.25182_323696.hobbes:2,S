I think this libata-dev patch was prior to that announcement.
It's 2.6.11-bk6-libata-dev1.patch which I appear to have downloaded May 15th.
(Sorry I guess "latest" wasn't very precise)

:(
What I really want to get working is actually hddtemp which uses SMART just to
get the temperature:
bash-3.00$ hddtemp /dev/hda
/dev/hda: MAXTOR 6L080J4: 50 C
bash-3.00$ hddtemp /dev/sda
/dev/sda: Maxtor 7Y250M0  YAR5: drive is sleeping
bash-3.00$ hddtemp /dev/sdb
/dev/sdb: Maxtor 6Y120M0  YAR5: drive is sleeping
The two M0 drives are SATA drives and they certainly are not sleeping. Come to
think of it that's awfully hot for the PATA drive. I think I'll put it to
sleep for a while.
