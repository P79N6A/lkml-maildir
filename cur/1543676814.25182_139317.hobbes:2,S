I apologize for failing to do a proper wrap-up. AIUI, we have:
(1) both 2.4.x and 2.5.x kernels support swapspaces of up to 64GB in size
(2) 2.4.x supports 64 swapspaces and 2.5.x supports 32 (not reparable)
(3) mkswap(8) needs fixes for creating swapspaces larger than 2GB merged
	back to util-linux; aeb (util-linux maintainer) has publicly
	requested the code be sent back to him for merging, presumably
	with some evidence of its correctness. One of the several distro
	people who are maintaining such patches against mkswap(8) is
	going to send that in.
