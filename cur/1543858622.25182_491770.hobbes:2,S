I was not aware that a bugzilla entry existed for this problem. I learned about it when my system 
would hang on bootup if the bcm43xx card was installed. By bisection, I learned which commit was 
causing the problem. About that time, the complete fix was discussed on the netdev and bcm43xx 
mailing lists. I was a little perturbed that only part of the fix was accepted into 2.6.19-gitX.
The full fix was pushed to John Linville on Dec. 10, who pushed it on to Jeff Garzik on Dec. 11. I 
have not yet seen any message sending it on to Andrew Morton or Linus.
A bug fix will always be accepted, particularly one that only changes 2 lines - it is only a new 
feature that will no longer be accepted once the -rc1 stage is reached. If this message doesn't do 
the trick and it isn't included by -rc2, I'll ping Jeff to see what happened. Changes always take 
longer than one likes, but one needs to be careful.
