I have had good luck with ASUS boards, the Intel chipset, and either the 
provided graphics or ATI (I don't like the binary nVidia drivers). I am 
just ordering one this weekend, and I'm going with the cheap PentiumD 
930 CPU because the quad core units will be out in the spring, and I can 
go with that without tying up money in a fast CPU now.
The Core2Duo is faster than AMD (today), has the hardware VM support, 
has 64 bit. And most of my clients are running Intel, which is some 
consideration regarding support expertise.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
