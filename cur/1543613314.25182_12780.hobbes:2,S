We'll get it back when the whole "everything has changed" fad dies down.  
Average together how long the OJ simpson trial lasted, the monica lewinsky 
thing, elian gonzalez down in miami, the press coverage of hurricane andrew, 
the original gulf war, nancy kerrigan, john wayne bobbit, joey buttafuoco, 
the military interventions in somalia and bosnia, the outcry over alar and 
malathion in california back in the 80's, dan quayle attacking murphy brown, 
the anti-nuke sentiment following chernobyl and three mile island...
That's our national attention span.  A year, maybe a year and change.  
Anybody who thinks some nut with a beard can keep this country permanently 
nervous obviously doesn't remember the cuban missile crisis.  (And of course 
there are a lot of people who don't, again because of our short attention 
span...)  Our military may be rather impressive, but our sarcastic 
self-centered indifference is legendary.  We're STILL bombing Iraq, and most 
of the US has forgotten that country even exists...
