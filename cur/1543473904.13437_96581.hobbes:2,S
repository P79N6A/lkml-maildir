And it doesn't work any better under MS OS's many times.
Sure, the current state of sound card support is less than stellar,
but my soundcard isn't supported under NT either.  I'm not planning
on whining about it, if I ever care enough I'll help hack support in.
It would be nice for novice users if the userspace scripts to
automate PNP config were installed with the distributions.

Set up the startup scripts to avoid conflicts between cards.
Devices on the same card should be able to share IRQ's safely.

I do by preference, I recommend it to my family and friends as well.
So should you.  ISA sucks so badly not even Microsoft wants to
keep it around anymore (see PC'99 spec).
