Actually my question was whether I should change the _kernel_ device
driver in order to support that. I guess this _is_ a kernel question ...
In the end, it was solved from userspace, but I didn't know that was
possible.
But ok, your advice was taken (believe me, I'm serious). I'll try and look
for docs more thoroughly before dropping a note here. Thanks.
Later,
Ivan
