ll/sc instructions on MIPS are as expensive as normal loads / stores.
(The pre-ll/sc thing SGI used in their R3000 based SMPs was horribly
expensive, special purpose hardware that was of course different from other
MIPS vendors' solutions and apparently at times needed *miliseconds* to do
an atomic operation old SGIers told me ...)
