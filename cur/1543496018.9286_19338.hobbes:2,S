Subject: kernel OOPS in 2.3.2 on USB device reattach

This is my first Oops report, so please let me know if there's anything I
can improve on for next time.
I'm running the stock kernel 2.3.2.  USB is compiled in the kernel, not as
a module.  I've been following linux-kernel for the past few days and have
seen nothing about this problem.  When I attached my USB keyboard, removed
it, then re-attached it, I got a kernel Oops. 
My hardware:  PIIX4-driven USB, UHCI, on-board a Asus P2B motherboard,
with two ports on the root hub.  My USB keyboard is from my iMac, model
M2452, which is also a two-port hub.  My USB mouse is also from my iMac,
model M4848.  My USB joystick is a Microsoft SideWinder Precision Pro.
I rebooted and gave "linux init=/bin/sh" to LILO before continuing these
tests.  I have been able to generate Oops on the following actions:
* attach keyboard to root, attach mouse to keyboard, remove mouse, attach
mouse to keyboard (either port). Panic.
* attach keyboard to root, remove keyboard, reattach keyboard to root
(either port). Panic.
* attach mouse to root, remove mouse, reattach mouse to root (either
port). Panic.
* attach keyboard to root, remove keyboard, attach mouse to root (either
port). Panic.
* attach keyboard and mouse to root, remove keyboard and mouse, attach
joystick. Panic.
But I have -not- been able to generate an Oops on this action:
* attach joystick to root, remove joystick, reattach joystick to root. No
loss of functionality to the system.
The messages I see on boot that are somewhat related to USB are:
USB HID boot protocol mouse registered.
USB ACM registered.

The remainder of this mail is the output from ksymoops.  Due to the nature
of kernel Oops, I wrote out the Oops on paper and then typed it back in to
be fed to ksymoops.  (I checked my syslog and there was nothing there
related to this issue.)  This re-typing may have resulted in errors,
though I was sure to triple-check each value.  ksymoops was executed under
the same conditions as which caused the Oops; namely, I fed "linux
init=/bin/sh" to LILO again. 
Options used: -V (default)
              -o /lib/modules/2.3.2/ (default)
              -k /proc/ksyms (default)
              -l /proc/modules (default)
              -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)
              -c 1 (default)
You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will assume
that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running right now
and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
No modules in ksyms, skipping objects
Warning, no symbols in lsmod, is /proc/modules a valid lsmod file?

I hope this is of use in finding the problem.  If there is anything more I
can do, please let me know.
Thank you for your time.
