You'll have to take that up with Linus and the minds behind Volatile Considered 
Harmful, but the crux of it is that volatile objects are prone to compiler bugs 
too, and if we have to track down a compiler bug, it's a lot easier when we know 
exactly where the load is supposed to be because we deliberately put it there, 
rather than letting the compiler re-order everything that lacks a strict data 
dependency and trying to figure out where in a thousand lines of assembler the 
compiler should have put the load for the volatile object.
If we're going to assume that the compiler has bugs we'll never be able to find, 
we all need to find new careers.  If we're going to assume that it has bugs we 
*can* find, then let's use code that makes it easier to do that.
I initially proposed a patch that made all the objects volatile, on the grounds 
that this was a special case where there wasn't much room to have a 
misunderstanding that resulted in anything worse than wasted loads.  Linus 
objected, and now that I've seen all the responses to the new patchset, I 
understand exactly why.  If our compilers really suck as much as everyone says 
they do, it'll be much easier to detect that with volatile casts than with 
volatile declarations.
