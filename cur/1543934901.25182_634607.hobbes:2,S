No, it would be safe, because the interrupting process doesn't
actually need to save 0xCFC (since it's a function of 0xCF8).  SMI
handlers use this technique to ensure they don't destroy OS config
space accesses.  Anyway, it doesn't matter.  As long as everyone CLIs
across the whole business, there is no possibility of races.

Yuck.  I'm going to assume that I can ignore this fact, as they're
already broken with respect to lots of other kernel code.

OK, I buy that now.  I'll fix the comment and resend.

Yes, technically.  It's a single "if" statement which tests for 0x1103
:).  What I was saying was that if lots more thermally-broken CPUs
show up in the wild, then we can expand this into a blacklist array.

I'm using k8_northbridges[] as my de-facto whitelist, because I
believe that future CPUs will probably function properly.  (It's hard
to imagine AMD removing or breaking a perfectly functional system,
apart from maybe adding new features.  Worst case, as I said, we  can
create a blacklist.  But right now, that's unnecessary.)
Any other concerns?
