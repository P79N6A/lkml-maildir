The probvlem is that most software does not know abaout capabilities. A
simple example is libc which will not ignore LD_PRELOAD because it does not
notice that there is a difference in effective and real capabilities of the
proces.
Personally I think this is solvable, and we realy need a way to enable
admins to use the least priveledge principle on their servers by removing
suid root programs completely.
