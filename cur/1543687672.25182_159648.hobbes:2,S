I have the same problem with some kernels (I get this with 2.4.21, don't
think with 2.6.0-test3-bk8 but not sure since its very unstable on my
machine and I don't have the time to play with it now).
The solution was to change the sleep level for ACPI when turnign of from
S5 to S4 (don't know why this works). In the file 
kernel-source-2.6.0-test3-bk8/drivers/acpi/sleep/poweroff.c
function
acpi_power_off
try replacing ACPI_STATE_S5 with ACPI_STATE_S4
