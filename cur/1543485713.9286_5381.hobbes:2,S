I have resolved my problem, and it is not a kernel bug.  I recall at least
one other post to linux-kernel with the same problem I had : processes
block for a long time in select(), for hundreds or thousands of seconds.
Running gdb on xclock revealed that XtWaitForSomething() was doing the
malformed select().  I upgraded to egcs 1.1.1 and I fetched the XFree86
3.3.3.1 patch and recompiled /usr/X11R6.  The new libraries fix the problem.
The reason the bug appeared after 2.2.0 may have been a version numbering
glitch in the X libs.  The compiler upgrade probably has nothing to do
with the fix, but I didnt take the time to rule that possibility out.
Why this happened only on my low memory 486 w/ nfs mounted file systems,
and not my 96MB pentium with local FS, I dont know.  The problem seemed
to be somehow correlated with using swap...  In any case, xload and
xclock work and Netscape is back to its (mostly) reliable self now.
Happily running 2.2.2,
