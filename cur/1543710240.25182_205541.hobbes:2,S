Subject: lufs removed from 2.6.4 kernel?

Hi,
it seems that (even with "prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers" enabled,
and "select only drivers selected to compile cleanly" & "select only drivers that don't need extra ..."
disabled) lufs is no longer in File Systems -> Miscellaneous filesystems.
Is this on purpose? It was still there in 2.6.3.
Thanks,
anjinsan.
