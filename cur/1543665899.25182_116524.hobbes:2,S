Not a bug.  The call chain is invalid:

The call to __tcp_v4_check_established() at line 694 takes a &tw paramater
which cannot be null.  This means that the call to tcp_tw_deschedule() at
line 629 will not happen and tw_death_lock is thus not taken on this path
while also holding a tcp_bind_hashbucket.lock.
If the caller provides a &tw param, a time-wait bucket (if found) is
returned via it to be destroyed outside the hash bucket lock.

See below.

These are indeed potential deadlock cases, caused by holding im->lock for
too long, now fixed by Alexey (in 2.5 bk at least).
