Why?
Getting 5000 lines of
"inkscape[13137] trap int3 rip:425051 rsp:7fffffa26158 error:0"
in my logs every time I ltrace something is vastly irritating and serves
no useful purpose.
Admittedly, I can (and have) turned this off, but disabling it by
default will probably save somebody else the trouble of figuring out
where this crap is coming from and how to kill it.
