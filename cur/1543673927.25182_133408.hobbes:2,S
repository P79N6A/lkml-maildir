PAGs as you describe them are beginning to sound like a Cray `job',
although used for a different purpose.
Each process had a jobid in addition to its other IDs.  This was set
at login or by NQS (or by a few other privileged processes), initially
identical to the session ID.  After that, setsid(), setpgid(),
setpgrp() etc., would not change the job ID.
The job ID was used for accounting and resource managemment, IIRC.
