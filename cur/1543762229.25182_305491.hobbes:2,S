Just correct one of the typo I made
Hi, Just test 2.6.12-rc1 and it works now. I tested it cz I saw lots of 
changes 
in usb=storage in the log not sure which item is applied. Do you still need the 
info. with 2.6.11? When working the type of disck is like:
with 2.6.12-rc1
usb-storage: device found at 2
usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning
   Vendor: SigmaTel  Model: MSCN              Rev: 0100
   Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 04
usb-storage: device scan complete
SCSI device sda: 501760 512-byte hdwr sectors (257 MB)
sda: assuming Write Enabled
sda: assuming drive cache: write through
SCSI device sda: 501760 512-byte hdwr sectors (257 MB)
sda: assuming Write Enabled
sda: assuming drive cache: write through
  sda: sda1
Attached scsi removable disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
The Vendor and Type etc.. are the same if using 2.6.8. With 2.6.9, 10, and 11 
it did not detect device.
Let me know if you still interested to debug it in 2.6.11 (I think no need :-) 
)
Thank you
Cheers,
