Actually, sorry...I misread the patch. It wouldn't have that problem. My
mistake.
Still though, I considered an approach somewhat similar to this early on.
I was thinking of taking a bit-shifted inode address and hashing it to
give a unique value. If you do the math, you can discard the lower 9 bits
of the pointer, so you end up being able to use the lower 41 bits of the
pointer. So a scheme like that could work if you could guarantee that
all inode addresses wouldn't be > 2^41 apart.
The problem is, you can't guarantee that, especially in a NUMA situation.
See the thread entitled:
[RFC][PATCH] ensure i_ino uniqueness in filesystems without
permanent inode numbers (via pointer conversion)
in linux-fsdevel, ~Nov 17th for more info.
