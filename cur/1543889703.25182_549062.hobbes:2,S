Splitting up the patches helped us all.  The AHCI, drivers/ide, and now
pata_atiixp patches were applied by the respective maintainers.  Let me
know if you need a quick introduction to git, which is the main tool to
watch the latest Linux kernel source code (it's like CVS, but better :))
I don't know about the SMBus patch, though.  That may or may not have
been applied.
