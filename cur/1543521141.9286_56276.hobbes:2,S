This happens when I try to compile pcmcia-3.1.8 (gcc version 2.7.2.3):
cc   -MD -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -pipe  -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE
-I../include -I/home/speck/experimental/linux/include -c i82365.c

In 2.3.36 compiling is fine.
It looks to me that pcmcia-3.1.8 is not aware of recent changes in pci.h
