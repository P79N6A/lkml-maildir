They both look like a two printk's overlapping each other, which isn't
unreasonable since one is an oops.  We try real hard to get oopses
out, which means "busting" the printk spinlocks.  The side effect of
busting those spinlocks is of course no console locking.
It may be annoying, but unless some SMP person wants to fix the spinlock
busting to be a little more inteligent, you can expect this situation
to continue.
