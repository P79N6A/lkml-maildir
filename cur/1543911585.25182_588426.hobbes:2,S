Ok, will append this in the changelog (I sent this to Rusty earlier
today):
Small test program for this:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#define BUFSIZE 1024
int main()
{
        int fd = open("/proc/modules", O_RDONLY);
        char buf[BUFSIZE];
        ssize_t size;
        do {
                size = read(fd, buf, 1);
                printf("%c", buf[0]);
                usleep(100000);
        } while(size > 0);
        close(fd);
        return 0;
}
Before fix, it prints the first module indefinitely. The patch fixes
this.
I will also append more detail to "Sort module list by pointer address
to get coherent sleepable seq_file iterators" changelog before the
2.6.23-rc3-mm1 repost.
