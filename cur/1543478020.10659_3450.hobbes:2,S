Per my previous comments, I believe that if you call out GNU, you need 
to also acknowledge the larger movement (X Window System, Berkeley software 
distribution, Apache, Samba, others), in order to avoid divisiveness.  
I think this is very important.  Be inclusive, not exclusive in attitude.
I think, as oppossed confusing the name "linux" that this (press release, and 
similar opportunities) is the sort of venue to spend a sentence or two 
to properly acknowledge the larger community.
