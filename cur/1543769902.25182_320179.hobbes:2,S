I'm talking about the autofs filesystem (actually the autofs4 module).

yep.
I'm not really concerned about whether bind and move mounts work or not. I 
just need to establish whether these should be supported and if so, how 
they should work so I can resolve the problem. Personally, I would be 
happy to say these types of mounts are not supported by autofs if I could 
veto the requests.
atm I can easily panic the kernel. As I said, it would be fairly easy to 
fail silently but ....
There's not much in it but see:

Sorry that my initial post was unclear and perhaps incomplete but mostly 
people are not that familiar with automounting and often they don't really 
want to know about it. I guess they have their own priorities.
Thanks for your interest.
Ian
