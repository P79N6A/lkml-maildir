The size of dev_t doesn't matter at all, what matters is how this number 
is managed and used. The kernel has somehow to generate a number for a 
device and tell the user about it, so that he can use it to access the 
device. This requires infrastructure and the actual size of this number is 
only a small detail in the whole picture. I want to know how the whole 
picture looks like, so could you please stop talking bullshit and answer 
my questions?

This won't happen, dev_t is the wrong place to encode such information.
