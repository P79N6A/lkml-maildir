It sure does. One of the nicest new gcc features IMHO!

GCC 2.95 does NOT support this. I only found out after I had people 
complain to me that Linux-NTFS userspace tools would not compile for them 
and it turned out they were using gcc-2.95... and I 2.96. - I have since 
then verified this myself:
egcs and gcc up to 2.95 do not support unnamed structs/unions.
gcc-2.96 and gcc-3.0 support them fine.

Neat trick! Thanks! I was wondering what to do with NTFS TNG driver (which 
uses unnamed structs/unions extensively) and this just might solve my 
problems without having to rewrite half the driver... (-;
Best regards,
