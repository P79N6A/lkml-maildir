Hi Patrick,
Thx for your prompt reply! Plz see some comments inline.

Even w/o bind, packet_create is doing a dev_add_pack, which I think will make pkts arrive to that socket (ie. in netif_receive_skb one can see the loops over the rcu for both ptype_all and type-specific which seem match whenever !ptype->dev || ptype->dev==skb->dev).
Also the packet_mmap.txt doc does not mention bind, which probably is more a mechanism to closely specify a dev than to signal socket readiness.
Salu2,
J.
