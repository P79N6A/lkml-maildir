You don't understand... It's not forced, it's just _the sane way to do
it_. When you finish I/O on a chunk of data, end I/O on that chunk of
data. This doesn definitely _not_ prevent transaction of more than 8
sectors per request, that's nonsense. It's only that way in the current
kernel because it was easy to get right the first time around. And it's
only in multi-write, oh look at multi-read, that does 16 sectors at the
time. Weee!

end_request _is_ the update request. You seem to not understand that
calling ide_end_request does not mean that we are terminating the
request from the host side, we are merely asking the block layer to
complete xxx amount of sectors for us so we can continue doing the
request residual.

Very wrong, make_request is never called here. Let me out line what
happens. Do you really mean start_request, if so then yes.

Is that so?
