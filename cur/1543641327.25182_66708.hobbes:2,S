        I think you're just exercising a bug in the stock
loop.c that I fixed in a recent patch for 2.5.31 loop.c.
It occurred when the of the file system block size was less than
than a page size, which I believe is what mke2fs will default to
for a ~20MB file system, as in your example.  The fix is item #3
discussed in my posting of an earlier version of the loop.c patch:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102924362322080&w=2
        although I posted a newer version of the loop.c patch
(which also has the fix but does not discuss it in the message text)
here:
