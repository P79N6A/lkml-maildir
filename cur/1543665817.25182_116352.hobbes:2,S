Believe me, many don't understand ET APIs. The epoll(4) man page tries to
answer to many questions but still it's not easy to wipe LT behaviour from
developers brain. On the other side, the merging of epoll inside the
kernel will have to have the goal to be actually and actively used by
developers. Due to the initial epoll architecture it was extremely easy to
have LT epoll and, right now, it has almost no cost to support both
behaviours. My current thought is to have the epoll user to choose the
behaviour on a per-fd basis, using a new EPOLLET event flag. I'm obviously
open to better suggestions ...
