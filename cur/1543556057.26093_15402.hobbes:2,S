We should, but we don't. 2.4 does the right thing. 2.2 got the following
change back in 2.2.6:
        res = PTR_ERR(dentry);
        if (!IS_ERR(dentry)) {
                res = permission(dentry->d_inode, mode);
+               /* SuS v2 requires we report a read only fs too */
+               if(!res && (mode & S_IWOTH) && IS_RDONLY(dentry->d_inode))
+                       res = -EROFS;
                dput(dentry);
        }
... and that's what really ticks me off - permission() does the right
tests in case of read-only fs (ignoring the r/o vs. r/w for devices and
FIFOs), but sys_access() explicitly overrides that.
IMO we should revert that in 2.2. HP/UX is probably hopeless - if they
will ever start caring about bogus behaviour access() will not be anywhere
near the top of their list ;-/
