Huh, my last compiling 2.6 sun3 tree ((old) m68k CVS) has those in
arch/m68k/mm/cache.c, which sun3 did use.
Ok, sounds like I need to make sure those are broken out sanely.  I'm
pretty sure memory.c is a bad place for that, since (as you observed),
it's motorola-mmu only code (or, at least, was...)
I'm considerably less scared now. :)
