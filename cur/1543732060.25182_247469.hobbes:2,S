i'd suggest to postpone this issue for the time being, the SMP hardware
in question produces 'mysterious' latencies in other, very unexpected
places as well. I suspect there's some issue that hits whatever code
happens to run - and the es1371 driver is used for the latency testing. 
So i believe it's just an innocent bystander. I'd suggest to look at
these again if they pop up after the 'mysterious' latency source is
found.
