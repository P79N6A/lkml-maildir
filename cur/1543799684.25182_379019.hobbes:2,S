Removed would make the source look prettier, but I assume it's
there for a reason, and should be corrected rather than removed.
I assume the reason is to add some necessary flagbits into prot;
and not to violate the permissions model by giving shared write
access to areas mapped privately.
I was wondering your estimation of the likelihood of problems if we
change sparc and sparc64 io_remap_pfn_range to respect the distinction
between shared and private, readonly and writable, early in 2.6.16,
or early in 2.6.17.
But this incident of X trying for MAP_PRIVATE (wanting that to mean
shared) before MAP_SHARED shows we cannot assume sanity around here.
Looks like we'd need to scatter VM_SHARED tests (like yours) around
various driver mmaps at the same time, to get X back to working on them.
I knew there were several drivers ignoring vm_page_prot in their calls
to (io_)remap_pfn_range; I hadn't realized that whole architectures
were doing so in low-level functions used by many.
Or is there a good argument that the shared-write/private-readonly
distinction makes no sense on anything you might apply
io_remap_pfn_range to?  That read access to the device amounts
to write access, because of side-effects?  (I know nothing of this,
I'm just trying to guess how I might be fussing unnecessarily over it.)

pgprot_noncached looks okay to me: not pretty, but doing just what
I'd expect, adding in some necessary flagbits while respecting the
permissions.  A hack yes (a subsequent mprotect would lose the
added flagbits I think), but good enough for most.
