As somebody who is now debating how to measure latencies in a 
giga-bit ethernet environment with several components doing 
L3 switching in much less than 10 micro-seconds ... (hardware)
I agree that some method is need to achieve higher resolutions.  
(Sigh... I will likely need to buy something big and expensive)
