Note that Fedora (and RHEL) kernels modularize nearly everything and
need an initrd to boot.  The kernel's "make rpm" does not make the
initrd for you (or fix up your grub.conf, IIRC).  So, the sequence is:
(unpack kernel)
cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
make oldconfig
(answer questions about new stuff)
make rpm
rpm -ivh <the-new-rpm>
mkinitrd /boot/initrd-<ver> <ver>
(edit grub.conf or what have you)
