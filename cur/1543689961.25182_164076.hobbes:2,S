Hi everyone,
kerneltrap gave me a more permanent place to host my patches.
http://www.kerneltrap.org/~npiggin/v14/
I'm starting to attack SMP and NUMA balancing, which is silly because I
only have a 2xSMP to test on (I'll try to get some NUMA time from OSDL).
I have provided rollups with and without the "core policy". Everything
else consists of cleanups and balancing changes, so its probably what
SMP/NUMA testers will want to use to start with.
