The way I look at it, this is about an API being the one with "least surprise".
So when one writes a kthread using its API, one would expect
kthread_stop() to dtrt and just work, which it will not, if the kthread has one
of such functions (which are just like any other, after all). Also, imagine
such a function being added to a kthread that didn't have it previously ...
the solution to which (sending a signal before kthread_stop) is un-intuitive.
Hence, why not make it part of the API itself ... It's not like the signal
would do any harm to other kthreads (that don't use such function) either.

And I agree, but there's quite a subtle difference between signals being
used like they normally are, and this case here. Fact is, there is simply
no other way to break out of certain functions (if there was, I would've
preferred that myself).
In fact, what I'm proposing is that kthreads should *not* be tinkering
with (flushing, handling, dequeueing, whatever) signals at all, because
like you mentioned, if they do that, it's possible that the TIF_SIGPENDING
could get lost.

Well, it's just an additional notice (apart from setting kthread_stop_info)
sent to the target kthread that its time has come ... I'm not sure how a
kthread would have exit "forced" upon it just by sending it a signal.
Also, note that _not_ using a signal would in fact mean that the kthread
_never_ exits at all (forget asap).

Ok, I think you're saying that if a kthread used wait_event_interruptible
(and was not expecting signals, because it ignores them), then bad
things (say exit in inconsistent state, etc) will happen if we break that
wait_event_interruptible unexpectedly.
First, such an error ought to be handled gracefully by kthread itself
anyway -- anybody who doesn't check the return of _interruptible()
functions is just asking for trouble.
Second, the kthread must expect that the stop notification _could_
have come during that sleep (in fact all good kthreads I've seen do
always put a kthread_should_stop() after all such blocking functions,
and not only in the while loop's condition) -- but even if it doesn't check
explicitly, what do we lose? If the kthread code _after_ the
wait_event_interruptible is written such that it assumes that the wait
condition has become true (as I mentioned above), then that code is
inherently buggy.
And thirdly, what I'm proposing is putting the check for checking the
SIGKILL in kthread_should_stop itself, in /addition/ to the
kthread_stop_info.k == current check. So the kthread will check
should_stop(), and if true, then exiting cleanly -- this is something that
all existing kthreads would do already (if some kthread out there exits
_uncleanly_ even after seeing seeing kthread_should_stop == true,
then it needs fixing anyway).
