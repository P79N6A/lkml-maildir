	IA32 is weakly ordered with respect to an outside observer but strongly
ordered with respect to the code in the processor. The result (with no
outside interference) is always exactly the same as what would occur if it
were strongly ordered.
	Put another way, the processor will reorder whenever it thinks that such
reordering will cause no problem.
	For example:
volatile int valid=0, value;
CPU0:
while(valid==0);
output=value;
CPU1:
value=45;
valid=1;
	Now CPU0 sees no dependency between the two reads, so it's free to use a
speculative read for 'value' -- one that actually took place on the bus
before the read inside the while loop.

	Positive. The processor has no way to know that another processor modified
the value 'out from under it', so it has no reason not to use the results of
the speculative read.

	It can't see writes from other processors to other memory areas. If they
already hold those areas exclusive, it's not even visible on their bus!

	In this case, the processor can see the depedency, so it knows to handle
this. What it in fact does (on the P2) is even smarter, it uses register
renaming to speculatively read in the 'wrong place' that happens to contain
the right value.
	In other words, any x86-family processor that reorders has to do
in-processor dependency analysis. The extent to which it can do this
analysis is the extent to which it can reorder. However, it is impossible
for it to see dependencies across processors. This is why we need memory
barriers.
