Would it make sense to do something like (in tty_io.c) the following?
void tty_flip_buffer_push(struct tty_struct *tty)
{
	if (tty->low_latency) {
		if (in_interrupt()) {
			printk(KERN_ERR "tty_flip_buffer_push called with low latency from interrupt!\n");
			dump_stack();
			schedule_delayed_work(&tty->flip.work, 1);
		}
		else
			flush_to_ldisc((void *) tty);
	}
	else
		schedule_delayed_work(&tty->flip.work, 1);
}
