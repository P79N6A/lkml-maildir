Is this the code in 2.4.0-prerelease or the code I sent you? Sounds like 
it's probably dying in an IRQ storm.

I have a full databook for the i82092aa and a selection of example boards - 
was yours one of those or another type? I'm not entirely sure when I'll 
have time to poke at it again - I may wait for the 2.5 branch.

Possibly. Is any driver trying to use irq 11? Can you disable the irq for 
the video card in your BIOS?
