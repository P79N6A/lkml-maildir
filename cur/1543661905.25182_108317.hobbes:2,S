I haven't tested ext[23] with that large a system on IA32 (I stopped
at 2.4TB, and that was on Linux 2.5).  The 2.4 LBD patch was basically
backported from the 2.5.9 version (the last tested version before Al
Viro's rewrite of the block device and partitioning code).  Differences in
ext[32] between 2.4.20 and 2.5.9 may not have been allowed for
properly.
I'll have a look when I'm in at work today.
Is there any reason why you're sticking with the 2.4 kernel and ext3?
XFS has been used (on SGI systems) for much longer with large disk
arrays, and I'd expect (linux-specific bugs aside) it to be a more
mature product for this application.
