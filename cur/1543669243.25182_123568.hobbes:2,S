 Last I saw they had a prototype that worked better than they expected.

I wouldn't expect the system to be able to do that any better than it can
resolve every merge conflict.  And at the very least I'd like to be able
link changesets together so that if I pull cset 1 and there is a mandatory
fix applied to it, I at least get a pointer to the changes.  Something
like this:
  1. Keep the csets separate but link them together.  Let the developer
     tell the system whether one is an enhancement or a bugfix to the base.
  2. Conflicts can be resolved when someone pulls any member of the group.
Stellation is also nice becuase it's built on a SQL database.  This gains
you all the features of the DBMS you run it on, like rollback of failed
transactions and point-in-time recovery.
