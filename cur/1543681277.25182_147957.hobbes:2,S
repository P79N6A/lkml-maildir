i'm afraid this, too.  both use completely different ac97 structs.
although it's possible to define an API which works for both drivers,
it would be a minimal subset, just only to read/write ac97 registers.
is the touchscreen plugin already in the latest 2.4 tree?
then i'd like to take a look and try to implement a tentative plugin
API.
