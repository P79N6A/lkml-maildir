This is quite true today.  But it is entirely possible that support in 
Linux for Xen may want to rip out the APIC / IO-APIC entirely, replace 
that with event channels, and use different SMP shootdown mechanisms, as 
well as having their own special NMI delivery hook.  We're also going to 
have to make certain parts of the interface extremely efficient, and 
we've already got several schemes to remove the penalty of indirection 
by being rid of indirect branches - which could be a more broadly used 
technique if it proves unintrusive and reliable enough.  In that case, 
you could basically support Voyager without a subarch, plus or minus one 
special hook or two ;)
