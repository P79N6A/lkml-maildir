I usually play tuxracer,tuxkart ,quake3,gltron (hardware 3d), and other 
OpenGL games and never had any kind of problem.
 Im running 2.4.17 on Asus a7v133 with Athlon 1333Mhz.Asus v7100 pro 
(geforce2 MX 400) (with latest nvidia drivers) and XFree 4.1.0
 The only problem I noticed was when using framebuffer going from X to 
console the system freezed.After deactivating frambuffer the problem has gone.
Best Regards,
João Seabra
