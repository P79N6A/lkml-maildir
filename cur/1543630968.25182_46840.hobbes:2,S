No, that's just a missed thing (for a while I thought I could use "nr" for
"freed", so I changed the code and forgot to add back the free'd).

Not likely, at least not in the form it was before of having two
completely different paths.
But I was thinking of doing a one-source thing that the compiler can
statically optimize, with something like
	#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
	#define fast_case(tlb) ((tlb)->nr == ~0UL)
	#else
	#define fast_case(tlb) (1)
	#endif
which allows us to have one set of sources for both UP and SMP, but the UP
case gets optimized by the compiler.
Do you want to do the freed and the above and test it?
