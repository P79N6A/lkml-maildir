I've meant: with 4KSTACKS there is probably no doubt it's needed, even
at the cost of some impact, which by the way could be more tested (and
there is a way to turn it off for, maybe, some conflicts). But, if you
checked it all enough and think such 'debugging' time is not necessary
then of course, without ifdefs it looks nicer.

OOPS! I didn't read the code around enough. Since it's one time event
there should be no problem of too much repeating, sorry! But, there
is probably still a question: if such a printk can overrun the stack
and possibly stuck the machine I would prefer to have some log on the
disk or possibility of sysrq or ctrl-alt-del than to write by hand or
take a picture with this one printk more... Of course, if I missed it
again, and there is choice or risk, then - no question & all correct.

IMHO 0 is the worst possible choice for this - I think it's used far
more often than others, there is only a question to stay compatible
with other debug checkers (or ifdef from them...), but anything else
looks much more credible to me.
