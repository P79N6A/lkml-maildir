Hi folks!
  It seems that there are still some problems with quota in all
recent kernels including 2.2.9+.
  After copying about 100MB to disk with active quota I got 
random seg-faults in mc. Also quotastats were absolutely screwed:
# quotastats
Number of dquot lookups: 4393
Number of dquot drops: 102176
Number of still active inodes with quota : -97783
                                          ^^^^^^^^ ???
Number of dquot reads: 188
Number of dquot writes: 8
Number of quotafile syncs: 134518708
Number of dquot cache hits: 4202
Number of allocated dquots: 5
Number of free dquots: 12
Number of in use dquot entries (user/group): -7
                                            ^^^^ ???
The kernel halted hard on shutdown w/o panic or message. The kernel was
compiled using RedHat 6.0's egcs:
Linux version 2.2.11-pre7
(paluch@bimbo.fjfi.cvut.cz) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux
(egcs-1.1.2 release)) #1 Tue Aug 10 09:14:35 CEST 1999
(I changed EXTRAVERSION = -pre7 to avoid confussion with future 2.2.11).
Generic RedHat's 2.2.5-22 seems to be rock solid w/ quotas:
# quotastats
Number of dquot lookups: 146
Number of dquot drops: 50
Number of still active inodes with quota : 96
Number of dquot reads: 15
Number of dquot writes: 1
Number of quotafile syncs: 134518708
Number of dquot cache hits: 129
Number of allocated dquots: 17
Number of free dquots: 11
Number of in use dquot entries (user/group): 6
Sincerely
