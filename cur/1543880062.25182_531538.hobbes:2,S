Actually I think this is something that makes sense to add, even if
just for debugging, but maybe also for production, depending on how
much it impacts things. Child runs first is an heuristic optimisation
that exploits a VM detail (however fundamental). But for things that
don't exec right after forking (and maybe some things that do), it
can be nicer to reduce context switches, improve cache patterns, and
allow children to be load balanced away before touching memory, if
child_runs_first is turned off.
