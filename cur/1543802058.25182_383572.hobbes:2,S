 Hello,
  updated version of my proposal for an RTC Subsystem. 
 I've fixed some locking issues, thanks to Dmitry Torokhov
 and added a driver for the Dallas/Maxim DS1672 Timekeeping
 chip.
 The subsystem should now be capable to handle all
 of the existing standalone drivers. 
 As usual, your feedback is highly appreciated.
