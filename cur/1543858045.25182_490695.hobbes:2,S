Please copy kvm patches to kvm-devel@lists.sourceforge.net in the future.
find_msr_entry() has been moved to vmx.c by another patch (now queued in 
-mm), so this patch does not apply.  The rest of the cleanups do look 
good though.
While I'll accept cleanup patches for kvm, there are other sources of 
churn right now, so it might be more efficient to wait with the cleanups 
for a few weeks.
