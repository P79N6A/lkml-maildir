Please ensure that CONFIG_KALLSYMS is enabled, then generate an all-tasks
backtrace or a locked machine with sysrq-T or `echo t >
/proc/sysrq-trigger'.  Then send us the resulting trace.
You may need a serial console to be able to capture all the output.
Also, it would be useful to know what sort of load the machines are under,
and what filesystems are in use.
Thanks.
