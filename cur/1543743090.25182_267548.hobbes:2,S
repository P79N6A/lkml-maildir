They make kswapd free pages when high order allocations fail.

order indicates the order which 2 will be elevated, to indicate how many
physical pages this "high order page" is, in size.
"2 ^ 0" = 1 page, order 0 , "2 ^ 1" = 2 pages, order 1,
 "2 ^ 2" = 4 pages, order 2 and so on.

__GFP_NOFAIL, from gfp.h:
 * Action modifiers - doesn't change the zoning
 *
 * __GFP_REPEAT: Try hard to allocate the memory, but the allocation attempt
 * _might_ fail.  This depends upon the particular VM implementation.
 *
 * __GFP_NOFAIL: The VM implementation _must_ retry infinitely: the caller
 * cannot handle allocation failures.
 *
 * __GFP_NORETRY: The VM implementation must not retry indefinitely.
