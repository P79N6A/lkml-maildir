Ok, thanks.  I was looking at fixing an `actual bug' in this driver
and I was wonder what else I could/should do while there.  I didn't
necessarily want to change `sizeof(struct Type)' to `sizeof(*value)'.
I considered that change to be somewhat dubious, even though I like
`sizeof(*value)'.  Of course, I unwittingly demonstrated what dangers
lie in making cosmetic changes [I was on my way to a party at the time
and my girlfriend was calling, excuses, excuses...].
So, It looks like I might fix the actual race condition, post that
diff, fix any other small oddities, post that diff.  If no one
complains, etc I can ask the maintainer.  Of course I will test it
myself as well.
regards,
Bill Pringlemeir.
