Did you run lilo after you installed the new kernel?
A friend of mine did this same thing on his box except he had 1 ide and 1
scsi.  Didn't have any problems at all, we told lilo to install on /dev/hda
and it found the scsi disk and booted.  Maybe what you need to do is when
you (assuming running lilo after the kernel didn't help) install the new
kernel, put it on /dev/hda1 if possible.  Create a linux dir and link /boot
to that.  when lilo runs, it knows it's data is on the first disk.
