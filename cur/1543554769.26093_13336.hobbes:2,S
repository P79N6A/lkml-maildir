This is known behaviour (I know Alan knows about it too), solution is to close
open directories filedescriptors before chrooting.
Everything that happens before chroot(2) is trusted, so it's secure to rely
on it to close directories first.
If this is not well documented and people doesn't know about it and so they
writes unsafe code that's another issue...
