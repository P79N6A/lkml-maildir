Depends on arch. Take a look at PAGE_SIZE and PAGE_SHIFT - look in
include/asm-*/page.h
Here's a nice web interface for browsing the source and quickly
finding the info you need :)  : 
http://lxr.linux.no/ident?i=PAGE_SIZE

For some archs the page size can be set at compile-time with
CONFIG_PAGE_SIZE_4KB, CONFIG_PAGE_SIZE_8KB etc - mips is an example of
such an arch (also take a look at CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE and friends).

Depends on your workload.

That makes perfect sense - i386 uses a 4K page size, ia64 is one of
the archs that support different page sizes (via
CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_* ).
some i386 machines can also use 4MB pages IIRC, but I don't think
Linux lets you configure that for i386, but I'm not entirely sure.

You can
 A) look in the .config file for your current kernel (if your arch
supports different page sizes at all).
 B) You can use the  getpagesize(2) syscall at runtime. getpagesize()
returns the nr of bytes in a page - man getpagesize - I'm not sure
that's universally supported though.
 C) You can look at /proc/cpuinfo or /proc/meminfo , IIRC some archs
report page size there - not quite sure, can't remember...
