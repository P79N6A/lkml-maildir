I see.  Basically, we're both (re)inventing the same thing.  :)
Now, it  is clear that there is  a need for direct  psaux port access.
It's useful for 2 reasons:
1) Compatibility with 2.4, 2.2, 2.0  kernels, so that programs need no
   modification and work as before.  This provides an easier migration
   path for those who want to upgrad to 2.6 for whatever reasons.
2) To  enable  using "strange",  not  yet  supported hardwares,  whose
   *mature* software  drivers are already available for 2.4, 2.2, 2.0,
   etc.  Not every writer of  those software drivers are interested in
   rewriting their programs in kernel space.
