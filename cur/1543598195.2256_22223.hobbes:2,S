Err, yes, I had initially made that mistake, but was fortunately running
on a single cpu machine. I fixed the test to check that the spinlock
was taken on the same cpu as we are now scheduling on and the test still
triggers.

My initial conclusion, based on recording file and line numbers every
time the spinlock is taken, is that end_that_request_last from ll_rw_blk.c
sometimes schedules under the io_request_lock.
I am still investigating, in the hope of pinning it down more exactly. If
anyone recognizes what goes on, please tell me.
