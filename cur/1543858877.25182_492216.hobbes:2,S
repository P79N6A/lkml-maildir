The problem I reported in the above link was related to UDF filesystem.
AFAIR, my DVD-RW have been formatted with "mkduffs --media-type=dvd",
which toggled a read-only flag at the FS level. I reformatted this DVD-RW 
with "mkudffs --media-type=dvdram" and the problem was gone.
I'm afraid this won't help you...
