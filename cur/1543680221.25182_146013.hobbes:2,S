With realtime scheduling, you will make the deadline regardless of load (and 
there is the normal fudge when you add the word "soft").  You're arguing that 
having your sound skip, so long as it only skips under load, is good enough.  
I'm arguing that, no, that sucks too much, it should never skip.  I'll also 
argue that even on 2.4, sound skips under normal loads if your machine isn't 
very fast.
So let's fix this properly, instead of wrapping on more duct tape.
Now, I will not argue that -nice+mingo+con is a proper realtime approach, but 
I will argue that it's considerably better than just fiddling with buffer 
size and hoping for the best.

I'm running make -j30 now, with the arrangement I described and sound is not 
skipping.  Convinced?
