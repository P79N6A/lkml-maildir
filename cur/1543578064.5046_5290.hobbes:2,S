Now I don't. What hardware are you using ?

What hardware what errors ?

It may well be compiler optimisation where the new gcc is optimising out 
something someone forgot in a driver or miscompiling a specific driver. 
One good way to test if its compiler or kernel triggered would be to rebuild
2.4.0 with egcs (aka kgcc).
I'd like to know what drivers you are running so I can try and duplicate it
