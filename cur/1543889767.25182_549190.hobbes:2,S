great. Btw., could you please keep the "up to this point there should be 
no behavioral change in CFS" fundamental splitup of your patches - that 
way i can look at the core changes (and possibly apply them) without 
having to consider the uid based changes (which do change behavior and 
which need more upstream buy-in).
