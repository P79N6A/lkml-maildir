As far as I'm aware, it depends on your hardware. For example, software mixing 
kicks in with zero configuration on most hardware that won't mix in hardware, 
e.g. my laptop's i810 audio.
[alistair] 15:18 [~] cat /proc/asound/cards
0 [I82801DBICH4   ]: ICH4 - Intel 82801DB-ICH4
                     Intel 82801DB-ICH4 with AD1981B at 0xa0100000, irq 11
1 [Modem          ]: ICH-MODEM - Intel 82801DB-ICH4 Modem
                     Intel 82801DB-ICH4 Modem at 0x3400, irq 11
I can successfully hear two mixed sources when I execute the following:
ogg123 -q --device=alsa09 01\ -\ Good\ Times\ Bad\ Times.ogg
And on another terminal
ogg123 -q --device=alsa09 01\ -\ Good\ Times\ Bad\ Times.og
This is ALSA soft mixing the two sources for me. Very nifty. However, if I 
throw an OSS into the mix (whilst these other two are playing).
[alistair] 15:20 [~/Music/Led Zeppelin - I] ogg123 -q --device=oss 01\ -\ 
Good\ Times\ Bad\ Times.ogg
Error: Cannot open device oss.
In fact, ogg123 hangs at this point (oh dear). If I try what you suggested and 
play two OSS sources, this doesn't work either:
ogg123 -q --device=oss 01\ -\ Good\ Times\ Bad\ Times.ogg
Works, but then:
ogg123 -q --device=oss 01\ -\ Good\ Times\ Bad\ Times.ogg
Error: Cannot open device oss
This is all a little OT for this thread, but it's certainly the case with 
alsa-lib-1.0.10 on 2.6.15-rc7. My card isn't capable of hardware mixing, 
yours might be (SBLive!/Audigy or something).
