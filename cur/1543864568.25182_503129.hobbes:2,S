Sorry I don't have 815G board nowadays, this board seems has two
pci devs, one for AGP bridge, another for integrated gfx card if no add-in card.
So have you tried both cases?

ok, just see the AGP tables bits definition for intel_i815_driver,
/* Intel registers */
#define INTEL_APSIZE    0xb4
#define INTEL_ATTBASE   0xb8
#define INTEL_AGPCTRL   0xb0
...
And this could explain why your patch can make X come back to live on
i815, as default suspend saves 64bytes. We need suspend func to handle
this, but for now mainline intel integrated gfx, this's not needed. 
Would you send out a cleanup patch later?
Thanks.
