Subject: Etiquette of getting a driver into the kernel

 I've a Phison "usb multiple card reader". Nice little device, though I
think the driver isn't the best (block size of 1k when reading & writing
gets 80k/sec, block size of 32k gets 850k/sec).
 The device came with a driver for linux on a floppy, as a patch against
2.4.2. It needed a little beating to get it to compile, and it caused
not-a-few kernel panics. Some kind soul on the net mailed me a newer
version, which does work a lot more reliably. The email address given for
the original author (in the source) doesn't seem to answer requests like
"is there a newer version of this driver", or "Is this driver GPL'd ?".
 Basically, I've a patch for it against 2.4.15, and I'm wondering how I
should go about getting it into the kernel, so others can debug it for me :)
John
