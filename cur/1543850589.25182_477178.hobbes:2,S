    Note that OpenPIC (as far as I could understand its h/w) is essentially
the same as IOAPIC/LAPIC couple on x86, i.e. a level-triggered IRQ remains 
effectively globally masked until CPU writes to its local EOI reg. However, 
the repetitive edge-triggered IRQ from the same line may still be detected 
while being serviced on a CPU (hm, the questions is, can it be sent to any 
other CPU in system while being handled on a certain CPU?)...
    I hope somebody corrects me if I'm wrong about both x86 and PPC. :-)
