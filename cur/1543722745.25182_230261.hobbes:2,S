I got caught on these, thinking that they weren't globals when
I made a assembly files that used, not only named labels but
also definitions like:
BUF = 0x08
LEN = 0x0c
code:	movl	BUF(%esp), %ebx
	movl	LEN(%esp), %ecx
This was done in several files. When linked, I got 'duplicate synbol'
errors. These symbols, while not 'globals' in the sense that 'C'
code can link with them are global definitions that are seen by
the linker and cause duplicate symbol errors. I went through
the gas documentation, trying to find how to prevent these
private symbols from being written to the object file and there
is no command-line mechanism. You just have to start every name
with .L to keep them local.
When I used labels like 'code' above, even though not declared
'.global',  the labels also showed up as duplicate symbols when
linking the resulting object files.
Cheers,
