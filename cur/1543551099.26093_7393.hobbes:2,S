I fully understand your point, but I don't want to have a special
case for ISA PnP. What about this change:
#define MODULE_GENERIC_TABLE(gtype,name)        \
const struct gtype##_id * __module_##gtype##_table = name
to
#define MODULE_GENERIC_TABLE(gtype,name)        \
const unsigned long __module_##gtype_size = sizeof(struct gtype##_id); \
const struct gtype##_id * __module_##gtype##_table = name
This simple change allows runtime checking for size of the used
structures. It's not only related for ISA PnP IDs, but also for PCI IDs.
All structures may be freely enhanced in future. The modutils binaries may
ignore the new contents and/or recommend upgrade.
Comments?
