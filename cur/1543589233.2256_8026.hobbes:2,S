GNU tar handles both of these. (Not particularly efficiently in the
case of sparse files, but that's a minor issue in this case.) See -S flag.
Perhaps more importantly, for a _robust_ backup solution which can
deal with partially unreadable tapes, you have pretty much no option
other than tar for the actual storage.
