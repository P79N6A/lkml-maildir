It is harder since you want to use everything that exists. You must base
SMP on a very fiew mechanisms you know about being implementable on 
everything. For synchronisation between CPUs, you can build everything 
with SMP semaphores (spinlocks), for example, provided that you base the
kernel code on a _right_ set of kernel primitives. 
Remember some recent mail from me about the way to doing things obviously
correct for SMP and not significantly more complex than UP. ;-)
