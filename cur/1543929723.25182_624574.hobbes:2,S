My test code are not doing much work but measuring overhead of various 
synchronization mechanisms such as barrier and lock. I am trying to see 
the scalability of different implementations/algorithms on multi-core 
machines.

You are right. If I manually do load balance (bind unrelated processes 
on the other cores), my test code perform as well as it did in the 
kernel 2.6.21.

The qmt.tar.gz code contains a simple test program call pthread_sync 
under the src directory. You can change the number of threads by setting 
QMT_NUM_THREADS environment variable. You can build the qmt by doing 
configure --enable-public-release. I do not have Intel quad core 
machines, I am not sure whether the behavior will show up on Intel 
platform. Our cluster is dual quad-core opteron which has its own 
hardware problem :-).

Hi, Ingo:
My test code qmt can be found at 
ftp://ftp.jlab.org/pub/hpc/qmt.tar.gz.
 
There is a minor performance issue in qmt pointed out by Eric, which I 
have not put into the tar ball yet. If I can be any help, please let me 
know. Thank you very much.
