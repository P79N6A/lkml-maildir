My understanding of this is following:
1. kswapd/balance_pgdat runs through all priorities, but fails to rise
zone->free_pages above zone->pages_min. So it exet. Which is strange.
2. nobody is going to wake it up, because all memory allocators are
looping indefinitely in that newly introduced do_retry loop inside
__alloc_pages.
I think either wakeup_kswapd() should be called in __alloc_pages()
before goto rebalance, or kswapd should loop until it restores all zones
to the balance (actually, comment before balance_pgdat() says it does),
or both.
Nikita.
