Hello,
I compiled a 2.4.28 kernel with modular IDE support. Running that kernel
on a machine and looking into /proc/ide/hda/settings shows that DMA is
not used for that disk, although I had chosen "use PCI DMA by default
when available". When a kernel with built-in IDE support is run, DMA for
hda is activated.
Why is it not activated in case of a module?
Kind regards
  Christoph
