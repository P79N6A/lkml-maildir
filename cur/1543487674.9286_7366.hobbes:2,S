You could use a pty and a /dev/vcs* device.

SysV does this.
init starts sac, the service access facility
sac starts ttymon when the system goes multiuser
ttymon monitors all ttys for usernames, then forks and execs login
You can get fairly detailed documentation for AIX, UnixWare, and Solaris
on the web, as well as the Unix98 standard.

Note that AIX has a SIGSAK signal. I think it is used for this purpose.
