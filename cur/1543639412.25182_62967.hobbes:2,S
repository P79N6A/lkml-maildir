Hi,
while playing with lsmod and modinfo I noticed that the module unix.o
doesn't have any license information, also it lacks information about
the authors:
|[salem:~]-30> modinfo unix                                                
|filename:    /lib/modules/2.4.20-pre1/kernel/net/unix/unix.o
|description: <none>
|author:      <none>
|license:     <none>
I would appreciate if at least the license and even better also some
author name would be added. Thanks.
Christian
