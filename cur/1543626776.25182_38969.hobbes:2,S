Not that it matters (he did send out a reprint) but the message *was*
merely signed.  The base64-looking encoding is merely a way to make
sure that MTAs and other software don't screw with tabs, line breaks,
etc., which would make the signature look invalid.

It doesn't look encrypted to gpg.  Pipe the message to it, you'll see.
