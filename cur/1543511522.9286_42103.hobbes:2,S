The limit is 512, not 256.  Anyhow, it has been agreed that this
really takes too much kernel memory; and you'd be better off running a
frame buffer anyway.  There really is no reason for the frame buffer
to have a limit below 2048; the 2048-character limit comes from the
width of the "direct to font" window (U+F000 to U+F7FF).
