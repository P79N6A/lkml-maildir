Are you running a battery monitor or something similar? In that case it
can cause the CPU to go into SMM with interrupts disabled to talk to
the batteries and completely forget about servicing the audio IRQ
thereby fscking up the sound. I had the same problems on my laptop and
killing gnome_battery_applet fixed it.
