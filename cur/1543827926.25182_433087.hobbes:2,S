Subject: patch for "bizarre read bug" in klibc dash
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I had forked ash awhile back, patched up a few things to behave the
way I wanted them.
While I was at it, I fixed the "echo X | read X ; echo $X" bug that
echoed a blank line.
I tried awhile ago to raise who was responsible for the code and got nowhere.
I suppose you think the above code is a bizarre corner case. It is
not. I use very
complex shell expressions (think loops and subshells) in pipes, with
read in the end to
get the variable I was looking for. The work-around is particularly ugly.
I was quite surprised that this bug never got squashed in dash. So, I
backported it.
Well, here's the patch.
