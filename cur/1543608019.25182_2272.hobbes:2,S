I don't think it has to do with whether the accessed bit is maintained
by hardware or by software.  On PPC, we actually maintain the accessed
and dirty bits in software - we don't use the hardware-maintained
R (referenced) and C (changed) bits, because they are in the HPTEs
(the PTEs in the hash table), and it is hard to get back from a linux
pte value to the corresponding HPTE.  The performance impact of
maintaining the accessed and dirty bits in software is negligible
according to the benchmarks I have done, and it is much much simpler
than trying to use the hardware R and C bits.
