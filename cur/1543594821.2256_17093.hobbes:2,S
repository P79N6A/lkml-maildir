Threads would then run, as a group, at the priority of the process, and 
then by priority within the process thread group.  To be truely useful, 
threads need to be able to have their run priority divorced from the 
priority of the spawning process.
By the way, I'm surprised no one has mentioned that a synonym for "thread" 
is "lightweight process".
