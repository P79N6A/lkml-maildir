If you had bought that laptop for audio use (big market these days, just
look at all the FireWire/USB/PCMCIA sound hardware out there), then this
would be a fatal problem.
Of course, for such a user, a BIOS where the hardware constantly block
interrupts via SMM would also be a fatal problem because it ruins audio
latency.  According to Alan Cox this is most laptops these days!
I am beginning to suspect the only known good laptop for pro audio use
is a Powerbook :-/.  x86 laptops are just too cheaply made.
