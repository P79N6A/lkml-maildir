As far as I can see all we need is something of the form
	serial8250_claim_uart(unsigned long ioaddr, int type)  
(type as we don't have iomap on most platforms yet)
	returning
		-EBUSY		"serial port is open"
		-ENOENT		"never heard of it"
		0		"ok"
and
	serial8250_unclaim_uart(unsigned long ioaddr, int type)
