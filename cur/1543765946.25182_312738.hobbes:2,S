top for example would probably break.  Maybe not but I suspect it would.
mplayer probably would since it uses it to find the cpu type and
features that cpu supports.

Well the tools that care are often architecture specific.  After all the
info in cpuinfo is very architecture specific.

Well there still is that sysconf call to get the number of cpus, which
is way better in C than parsing a text file to get the info as far as I
am concerned.

What info do they provide in that on BSD?

The info in cpuinfo is only of interest to a tool that knows about the
architecture it is on.
It is not meant to look up the number of cpus the system has.  It is
meant to provide the info about the cpus in the system, which means it
provides info relevant to the cpu on a given architecture.
