that's fine, this is just RFC to see if there's obvious broken bits, etc.
also, i still need to do some split out of the pit.  it and hpet are nearly
identical though, so i don't noticing any issues with this.
the part i know is broken is lapic broadcast, so i'd like to fix that
up too.  trouble is, it's broken on vanilla too, so i'm not 100% sure
what i'm debugging yet.
thanks,
