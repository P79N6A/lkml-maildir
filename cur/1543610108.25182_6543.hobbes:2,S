look at swap cached in /proc/meminfo       that will tell you what is 
mirrored. 
Also, your box may not be actually doing much swapping if any at all.  vmstat 
will tell if you're actually doing any swapping at a given time.  
Allocation may carry over to swap, but it doesn't effect performance in any 
way in doing so.  That's why looking at anything but vmstat really wont tell 
you much about what's actually being used in swap.
