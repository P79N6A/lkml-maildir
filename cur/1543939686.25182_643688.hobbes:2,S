No, the logic in this function is just crazy.  It's recursive, but we
can circumvent the creation for the kobject and whole creation of the
threshold_block if some conditions are met.  That's why we see the
allocate_threshold_blocks so many times in the callstack, yet only a few
kobjects created.
Then we blow up in kobject_uevent_env() on the first debug printk.
Which means that we are just passing in garbage.
Let me know if the patch below fixes this for you, I think it should, as
there is a code path where b is NULL and then we call kobject_uevent.
Man, this is one time that comments in code would have been very nice to
have, and why forward goto's into major code blocks are just evil...
thanks,
