On x86-64 the 64bit write is atomic against interrupts.
You're right 32bit has a problem though. I'm not too happy about 
cmpxchg though because that wouldn't work on some CPUs.
I wonder if we can just get away with using a 32bit value on i386.
Just for the purpose of keeping the value monotonic it should be good
enough. Will think about it.
Thanks for the review.
