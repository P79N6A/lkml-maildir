No, it wasn't the problem, even when loading with insmod/modprobe the 
timeout occurs on some configurations. For example on 
http://atm.eagle-usb.org/wakka.php?wiki=TestUEagleAtmBaud123,
 you could 
see the 'firmware ueagle-atm/eagleIII.fw is not available' error.
It is only happen for pre-firmware modem (uea_load_firmware) ie where we 
just do a request_firmware in the probe without any initialisation before.
So the problem seems to appear when we do a request_firmware too early 
in the usb_probe.
