Building 2.6.17-rc5-mm1, I get this:
	net/built-in.o: In function `ip_rt_init':
	(.init.text+0xb04): undefined reference to `__you_cannot_kmalloc_that_much'
This seems to be coming from:
	rt_hash_locks = kmalloc(sizeof(spinlock_t) * RT_HASH_LOCK_SZ, GFP_KERNEL);
I have CONFIG_NR_CPUS=32, so RT_HASH_LOCK_SZ ends up as 2048.  Also, I
have both CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y and CONFIG_PROVE_SPIN_LOCKING=y so
spinlock_t is bloated up quite big:
	typedef struct {
		raw_spinlock_t raw_lock;
	#if defined(CONFIG_PREEMPT) && defined(CONFIG_SMP)
		unsigned int break_lock;
	#endif
	#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK
		unsigned int magic, owner_cpu;
		void *owner;
	#endif
	#ifdef CONFIG_PROVE_SPIN_LOCKING
		struct lockdep_map dep_map;
	#endif
	} spinlock_t;
I only have 8 CPUs in the box, so updating my config from the x86_64
defconfig fixes things for me.
No patch because I don't really know how to fix this properly...
