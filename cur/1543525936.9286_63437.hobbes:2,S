Autodetection is unreliable and causes problems, as it was said.  NT
may do that, but NT is supposed to be running on better hardware.  No
guarantees for other systems.  Linux is supposed to run everywhere.

There is IRQ autodetection code.
And modules never do autodetection anyway.  It's "acceptable" that the
kernel crashes because of bad hardware probing while starting, but it's
absolutely inacceptable to crash a running system by inserting a
module.

Do you mean IRQ sharing?  Supported of course (required for PCI).  Not
for ISA, because ISA does not support shared IRQs.
