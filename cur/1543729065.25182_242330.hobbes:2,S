I'm not at all convinced we (ie the DRI project) can abandon 2.4 support.  In 
fact we made this mistake with the 2.2/2.4 transition - we didn't support 2.2 
at all, only 2.4 and for a long time this was a big inconvenience to users.
We may not be feeding our changes into the 2.4 kernel (or maybe we are), but I 
definitely view 2.4 support as important for probably 1 to 2 years to come.
If we can manage to support FreeBSD and Linux from one codebase, surely 
supporting 2.4 and 2.6 isn't too difficult?
