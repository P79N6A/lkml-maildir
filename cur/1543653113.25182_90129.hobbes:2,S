thanks, that's nice to see that this old 2.2 patch
still works without too much changes on 2.4 and 2.5.
I think it's because it touches only really stable
parts of the kernel :-)
If you're interested, I've updated the web site and
put your patch on it under 0.4.3. BTW, a long time
ago (about april), I updated it to 0.4.4, but didn't
put it on the web site. The only change is that now
by default, it automaticall scrolls to the end of the
messages when dumping on the screen, so that with a
few presses on the "up" key, you can see the most
interesting messages.
The patch is really trivial, and should apply above
yours without difficulty. I've put it in the 0.4.4
directory ( 
http://w.ods.org/tools/kmsgdump/0.4.4/
 ).

seems correct to me since it works this way in 2.4.

thanks, I'll try as soon as I recompile a 2.5, but not
immediately though.
Cheers,
Willy
