You're really muddying up the waters here. sftp is not POSIX. Like ftp, 
it presents an abstraction of a generic filesystem, and that abstraction 
lives at the application layer. As such, it is the application layer's 
responsibility to define what features may or may not be implemented. 
There are plenty of smart ftp servers that let you define precisely this 
type of ACLs for the ftp users. The fact that it is both possible and 
trivially easy to implement such an application on top of a POSIX 
runtime environment tells me that there's nothing broken here.
