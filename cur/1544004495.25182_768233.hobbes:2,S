Hi guys,
The commit below is apparently wrong. Maybe you CCed HID maintainer, however
linux-input didn't get the message, or at least I can't find it anywhere.
There is a difference between hid_blacklist and hid_ignore_list. One forbids
generic hid driver to bind the device, while the other forces usbhid to release
the device and move hands away from it.
You picked up the former, which is wrong. I wonder if you were so lucky that you
didn't hit it. Care to send a fixup with proper CCs?
Thanks.

    V4L/DVB (9337a): HID: Don't allow KWorld radio fm700 be handled by usb hid d
rivers
    This device is already handled by radio-si470x driver, and we
    therefore want usbhid to ignore it.
