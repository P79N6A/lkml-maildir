Hi Andrew,
According to Linus' 2.5.1-pre changelog, the release locking changes
introduced in -pre5 are your work. Those changes, however, seem to
break the keyboard driver:
keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?(f4)
Other people (i.e. Mike Galbraith) have been experiencing the same.
Do you have an updated patch which fixes those issues? -pre6 still
contains the same stuff as -pre5 and if it's broken then Linus should
probably back it out.
Regards,
Udo.
