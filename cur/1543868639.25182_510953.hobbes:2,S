Yes we do -- both writes will succeed.  More importantly, if one modifies 
the first 512 bytes of a page and the other modifies the last 512 bytes of 
the page, both writes will show up in the completed result.  This is not the 
case with the -EIO bailout.

Except that we're not handling cases like the one mentioned above, which 
is quite broken.
