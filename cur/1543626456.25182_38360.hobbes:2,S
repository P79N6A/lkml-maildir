Subject: PROBLEM: OOPSes with ipchains on 2.4.18

[ This is my first ever kernel problem report. Please let me know if I'm
  reporting it to the wrong place or using the wrong format. ]
Full Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm suffering from intermittent kernel oopses on my main machine. As far
as I can dechipher, the kernel oopses happen in the ipchains.o module.
The kernel oopses identifiy themselves as "tainted", which I don't quite
understand: The only modules *ever* loaded are modules produces from the
standard kernel sources as downloaded from ftp.kernel.org. No patches
have been applied. I have even taken the precaution of clearing out
/lib/modules and re-compiling the modules from the kernel (make modules
&& make modules_install). As far as I can see during boot-up, the kernel
warns about being tainted as soon as ipchains.o is loaded.
/proc/version:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Linux version 2.4.18 (root@hawking) (gcc version 2.95.4 (Debian prerelease)) #4 SMP Mon Mar 25 23:19:15 GMT 2002
Keywords:
~~~~~~~~~
    ipchains
    2.4.18
    netfilter
    
Output from oops:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    See kernel-panic[123].txt attached. I only have the last 24 lines of
    each, as they scroll off the screen. Let me know if I need to get
    the preceding lines - I presume "vga=<something>" in /etc/lilo.conf
    should do the trick.
    I ran ksymoops on it (with same modules loaded in the same order),
    and it consistently points to the ipchains module and diald. The
    stack traces are identical too, although there are slight variations in
    the register contents.
    The ksymoops output and kernel .config (named config-2.4.18) is attached.
Somewhat reproduceable:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Unfortunately, I cannot reproduce the problem "on demand". But since
    it seems diald/ipchains related, I have attached the output of
    "ipchains -L -n -v" (packet counts from a later boot of course), so
    you can see the firewalling rules in effect.
    I have not tried modifying with the firewalling rules (yet);
    they have served me quite well under kernel 2.2.
Environment:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    (not sure this matters to much for your diagnostics of this
    specific problem, but who knows?)
    Debian GNU/Linux - woody
    Motherboard: Abit VP6
    Single 800MHz Pentium Coppermine (in socket *2*, not 1. The previous
        occupant of socket 1 died - cause of death was presumably 
        overheating: Some of the thermal paste stuff was missing. Worked
        13 months though...)
    512 Mb memory
    NOTE: I am not 110% sure that my hardware is OK. It is not always
    willing to boot after a power on/off cycle, and doesn't always get 
    as far as lilo before hanging - that has happened twice in the last
    month.
    However, as the oopses consistently point to ipchains/diald, and it
    is rock-stable under kernel 2.2.20 (once it manages to start), I
    don't think this is a hardware related problem.
    
Software:
~~~~~~~~~
    Debian GNU/Linux - woody.

Other Information:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    I'm not comfortable with the fact that the ipchains module "taints"
the kernel upon load. I'm aware that ipchains is deprecated in favour of
iptables, and that's the way I'm going. But to get there I only want to
change one thing at a time. Undoubtedly you know the drill already.
Currently, I'm using kernel 2.2.20, and the machine is overdue for a
kernel update. So I decided to go straight for 2.4.18.
Perhaps I would be better off upgrading to 2.4.x (x < 18), switching
over to iptables, and then going to 2.4.18? If so, which version of the
kernel would you suggest? My main criteria is that it should support
both ipchains and iptables, so I can perform a smooth transition.
