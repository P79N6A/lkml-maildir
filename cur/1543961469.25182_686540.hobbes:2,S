Wow, that is messed up.  Especially since "/bin/sh --version" and "/bin/bash
--version" give me the same output.
Would you say that OS X is broken?  I'm having a hard time finding documentation
for 'sh', so I can't find out what echo -e  is supposed to do in 'sh'.
I read in the latest Linux Journal magazine that someone noticed that even
though the kernel scripts say #!/bin/sh, many of them are really bash scripts.
This person went through the effort of changing the script to be true 'sh'
scripts.  Has that code been merged in?

But the scripts still reference /bin/sh, so I would need to change the scripts
or symlink /bin/sh.  If I'm going to symlink /bin/sh, I'd rather just symlink it
to /bin/bash.

But printf is bash, not sh.  I would need to change #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash.
