OK.  So which patch do you want?  :)  The omac.c with scatterwalk, or the
cipher.c with omac performed in-place when needed?

finish_omac() needs to be called once all data is processed.  How do I know
for sure the caller is done with this cipher context instance?
For example:
  loop {
    /* get more data into sgin */
    crypto_cipher_encrypt(tfm, sgout, sgin, len);
    /* send our data out of sgout */
  }
  /* get the 128bit OMAC and send it since we're done with all our encryption */
And decryption:
  loop {
    /* get more data into sgin */
    crypto_cipher_decrypt(tfm, sgout, sgin, len);
    /* send our data out of sgout */
  }
  /* get the 128bit OMAC and compare it with transmitted OMAC since we're done
     with all our decryption */
There is no explicit/implicit "crypto_cipher_encrypt_final()" to inform the
API to finalise the OMAC.

Gladly.  Makes the beer at the pub go down with less guilt when I can say my
name has appear in one more kernel source file.  :)
