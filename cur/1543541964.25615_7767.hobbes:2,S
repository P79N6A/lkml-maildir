I thought it looked a bit broken, but I stuck the call in there anyway since
it was obviously missing.  One of the other things my patch does is move all
the functionally identical inlined do_profile functions out of the
architecture-specific directories and into linux/sched.h, where the other
prof stuff is.  It would be nice to get this into the official kernel to
prevent the problem recurring.

I assume you mean the ARM-specific version rather than Alan's kernel here?
