I ran into this yesterday when I was backing up a laptop hard drive.  I
pulled the drive, stuck it in a machine (which is basically a test machine
w/o harddrives and a nfs mounted /) and copyied hda to a file over nfs. 
After about 100mb copyied, I got an oops and the system froze (this is
2.2.1).  It froze after cp segged.
I tried it again, it copyied about 300mb and did the same thing using cat. 
What was funny was the fact that I used gzip -1 to do this and it worked
just fine.
