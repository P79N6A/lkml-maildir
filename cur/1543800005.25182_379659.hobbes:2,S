hm, i dont seem to have problems with DEBUG_INFO. I picked a random 
address within the kernel:
c035766f T schedule_timeout
(gdb) list *0xc035768f
0xc035768f is in schedule_timeout (kernel/timer.c:1075).
1070                     * should never happens anyway). You just have the printk()
1071                     * that will tell you if something is gone wrong and where.
1072                     */
1073                    if (timeout < 0)
1074                    {
1075                            printk(KERN_ERR "schedule_timeout: wrong timeout "
1076                                    "value %lx from %p\n", timeout,
1077                                    __builtin_return_address(0));
1078                            current->state = TASK_RUNNING;
1079                            goto out;
(gdb)
or is it something else that breaks?
