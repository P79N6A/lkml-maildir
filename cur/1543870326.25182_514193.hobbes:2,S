Not quite Andrew.  This was a different and little more complicated.
The deadlock occurs because two CPUs are in contention over a rw_lock 
and the "call_function" puts the CPUs in such a state that no forward 
progress will be made until the calling CPU has completed it's code.
Here's a more detailed example (sorry for the cut-and-paste):
1.  CPU A has done read_lock(&lock), and has acquired the lock.
2.  CPU B has done write_lock_irq(&lock) and is waiting for A to release 
the lock.  CPU B has disabled interrupts while waiting for the interrupt:
void __lockfunc _write_lock_irq(rwlock_t *lock)
{
        local_irq_disable();
        preempt_disable();
        rwlock_acquire(&lock->dep_map, 0, 0, _RET_IP_);
        _raw_write_lock(lock);
}
3.  CPU C issues smp_call_function, as in the case of the intel-rng driver:
    set_mb(waitflag, 1);
    smp_call_function(intel_init_wait, NULL, 1, 0);
    ...
    // do some stuff with interrupts disabled
    ...
    set_mb(waitflag, 0);
where
static char __initdata waitflag;
static void __init intel_init_wait(void *unused)
{
        while (waitflag)
                cpu_relax();
}
In this code the calling processor, C, has issued an IPI and disabled 
interrupts on every processor except itself.  When each processor takes 
the IPI it runs intel_init_wait and waits in a tight loop until  
waitflag is zero.  ie) no forward progress on any CPU.
CPU C will not execute the code below the smp_call_function until all 
processors have started (not completed!) the IPI function.  From 
call_smp_function:
        cpus = num_online_cpus() - 1;
        ...
        /* Send a message to all other CPUs and wait for them to respond */
        send_IPI_allbutself(CALL_FUNCTION_VECTOR);
        /* Wait for response */
        while (atomic_read(&data.started) != cpus)
                cpu_relax();
So CPU C is waiting here.
4.  CPU A, which holds the lock sees the IPI and is in the 
intel_init_wait code, happily waiting.  CPU A has incremented 
data.started.  CPU A will stay in this loop until CPU C sets waitflag = 0.
5.  CPU B, if you recall is _waiting with interrupts disabled_ for CPU A 
to release the  lock.  It does not see the IPI because it has interrupts 
disabled.  It will not see the IPI until CPU A has released the lock.
6.  CPU C is eventually only waiting for CPU B to do the final increment 
of data.started = cpus.  CPU B is waiting for CPU A to release the 
lock.  CPU A is executing a tight loop which it will not exit from until 
CPU C can set waitflag to zero.
That's a 3-way deadlock.
So, the issue is placing the other CPUs in a state that they do not make 
forward progress.  The deadlock occurs before the calling CPU has 
disabled interrupts in the code in step 3.
I also tested this code without the __init tags and explicitly coding 
waitflag=0 to avoid the gcc only setting .bss section variables to zero 
error that someone fixed last week.  I also removed the code that 
disabled interrupts on the calling processor which had no effect -- at 
first I thought it was a simple interrupt issue ...
Maybe smp_call_function needs a written warning that the called function 
should not "suspend" CPUs?
