I assume you mean kill is a shell builtin. Depending on your shell. :-).
It's still a real pain when you want to get the pid of the offending
proces(ses). You could of course do something like
for a in /proc/*; do echo -en "$a "; cat $a/cmdline; echo; done (it'll
barf a lot, but give a reasonable picture)...
Anyways, this is all not relevant, imho the whole point is moot.
"I don't like root having rlimits."
"So don't setrlimit root."
No reason to ditch functionality.
