Hi,
While sending a datagram the IP_PKTINFO IP option allows to set the source IP
address and the output interface of the outgoing packet.
The option allows only the valid interface IP addresses (due to a check in
ip_route_output_slow()) of the machine to be specified as source IP address.
1. I am wondering if we can allow any valid source IP address to be specified as
source IP address?
2. The output interface should be specified as an interface index, which I
assume is internal to kernel. Is there a way to know the interface index from
user space?
