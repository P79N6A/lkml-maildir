No errors.

Moral: stop buying crappy power supplies. :-)
My power supply is fine.  If the PS were at fault, the same thing would
be happening all the time, not just when linux tries to throw 200 sectors
at a time at the drives.  Windows has been stressing these drives far more
than linux and there's been zero idication of any problems.  As I said,
writing in O_DIRECT mode to the array @ _35MB/s_ never reports a DMA
timeout -- I'll start increasing the buffer size to see where the cracking
point is.
