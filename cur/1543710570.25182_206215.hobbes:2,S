You cannot do any metric based on defconfig, since per. definition defconfig is what
suits Linus's current i386 PC best.
If you really want to do a proper metric do something like the follwoing:
make allnoconfig
Use some sed/awk magic to enable the options you are interested in
- Networking
- procfs?
- ext2
- One net driver
- A bit more which make sense
make oldconfig
This should result in a reliable config for code metrics.
You just have to inspect that noone of your manually added options
are no longer recognized (grep for warnings in output).
If you get this working it would be nice to see the evolution starting from 2.6.1 and
onwards in line with John Cherrys compile stats.
