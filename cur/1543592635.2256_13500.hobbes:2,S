Hm, in that case I think I will implement it the way I was thinking and I 
will assume that it can't happen any more. - I will add some kind of sanity 
check at the beginning to catch problems and scream to the syslog which we 
can remove later.
Does anyone know what NTFS version the NT 3.1 / 3.51 volumes had? If I know 
I can make sure we don't mount such beasts considering we know the driver 
would fail on them... - I am aware of only one person stil using NT 3.51 
and he doesn't believe in the NTFS Linux driver any more, so I guess we can 
just say we support NT 4.0 and above only.
