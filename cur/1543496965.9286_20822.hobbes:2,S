I have a Spectralogic dual AIT tape drive with robot tape
changer arm that I am trying to use for departmental backup.
The tape library is attached to a dual cpu Intel 450 MHz
machine via a Adaptec 2944 FW-Differential controler. 
I am running linux 2.2.9 for the updated generic scsi driver,
but the problem I am reporting happens with 2.2.3 and 2.0.36.
I often get scsi timeout errors. I have recently compiled
turned on the DEBUG #define in drivers/scsi/st.c and I see
the following:

Can anyone shed some light on what this error is, and how I may
prevent it?
