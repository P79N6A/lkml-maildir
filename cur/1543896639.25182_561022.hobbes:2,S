Ah, it all makes sense now. In this case I assume mem=4000 is perfectly 
safe and usable for the time being. In the beginning I tried with 
mem=4g, which obviously did not work. If anyone is interested in adding 
an exception/workaround for this particular motherboard, I'd be happy to 
help with testing. I have added more information about the system: 
current kernel config [1], output of `lspci -vv`[2], dmesg with mem=4000[3].
Thank you!
Peter
