It will probably require a few extra steps:
- read Documentation/CodingStyle (mixed case, typedef from hell, ugly #ifdef);
- grep ^static
  -> no static functions ? Uh ?
- use non-obsolete API (pci_find_device in 2005 ?);
- convert the os independant wrappers.
Btw it would probably make sense 1) to figure out what can be merged with
the in-tree DSCC4 driver and 2) to integrate the driver with the existing
hdlc stack. Imho there is some duplicated work/code.
