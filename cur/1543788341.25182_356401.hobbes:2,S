Don't do that then.

I don't think there is an way specified in the architecture. So you're
definitely in undocumented system dependent territory if you attempt this.
delay.
Or maybe a write combining access (movnti) follwed with a sfence.

We already have such cases - e.g. our rwlocks always had such a deadlock
even on SMP systems. As far as I know it has been reported exactly once on a 
64CPU IA64 system, but it wasn't possible to fix it without large scale
changes so it was ignored.   I am not aware of the problem ever happening on a 
production system.
And in general fairness was never a force of Linux. A lot of subsystems
do resource handling / sharing without taking it into account. And so far
we got away with it.
I'm not saying it's a good thing, but that general strategy  
doesn't seem to have hurt us significantly so far and the fixes are usually
worse than the problems.
