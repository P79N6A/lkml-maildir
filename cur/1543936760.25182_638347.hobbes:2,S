ntpd will allow an initial correction that is arbitrarily large, if run 
with the -g option. This is a commonly used option. I see it is running 
on my stock Fedora Core 8, for example. So there is often no need to run 
ntpdate.
Also, ntpd keeps track of how fast your local clock tends to drift, and 
attempts to compensate. So, even if the local clock runs quite fast or 
slow, you'll normally get good results. The exception would be if you 
clock's drift rate jumps around; for example: fast today, slow tomorrow.
On most systems, ntpd will also copy the current time back to the CMOS, 
periodically, and during an orderly shutdown.
Hope that adds some clarity.
