Ah, much nicer, thank you. I'll submit it, but first, what do you
think about this version? it keeps the optimization and enforces the
"bit1 and bit2 must be single bits only" rule. It could probably be
improved to be done at  build time, if bit1 and bit2 and compile time
constants. Against 2.6.0-t6-cvs, compiles and boots for me.
