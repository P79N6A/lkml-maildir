Marvin,
 could you elaborate a bit more :-), or point me/us to your post
(couldn't find it). We are currently evaluating solutions for doing HDTV
playback for one of our customers. This will need about 300-320 MB/sec
read. We know (at least someone claims so) that you can do it with SGI
equipment at a price. The goal for the customer is to definitely beat
that price :-))
