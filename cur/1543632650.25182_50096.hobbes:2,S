I have been seeing lockups on the same kernels with compact flash and a
dual PCMCIA adaptor in an SMP machine. Prior to pre7 the kernel PCMCIA
would take forever (longer than overnight) to access the device, while
disabling the kernel PCMCIA and using the separate modules works.
The kernel stuff works fine in a uni laptop, so hard to tell where the
problem lies, other than I think you mentioned being SMP also?
Random semi-relevant facts, hopefully useful to someone.
