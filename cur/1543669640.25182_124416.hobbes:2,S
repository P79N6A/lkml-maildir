Yes. I was just pointing out this was a byproduct of our compaction
requirement in 8:8, not necessarily a guarantee I think needs
preserving.

This, I'm not too sure about.  I see the value to kernel developers who
boot between different versions of the kernel, but I think when 2.6 goes
live and ships to end users, it's better not to have such numeric
equivalency crufting up the SCSI interfaces.
