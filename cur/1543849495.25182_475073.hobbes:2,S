As far as I know, this has always been documented.
The datasheet is located here:
http://developer.intel.com/design/chipsets/datashts/313056.htm
Indicates that 10b is valid for combined mode.  Make sure you are looking
at device 31 function 2 - for 31 function 5 it is hardwired to 00b, but
for function 2, it can be 00 or 10.  This was not very clear, so it's
easy to understand how this could have been misunderstood.  See 
section 11.1.33 in the notes, or do a search on "combined mode" through
the doc, and you'll see that MV can be 10b when SCC is 01 on device 31
function 2.
