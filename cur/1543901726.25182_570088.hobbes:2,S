        These are not different in v4 vs v6. Group membership is 
per-interface,
delivery depends on the binding (for both v4 and v6), and this is the same
as BSD behavior since IP multicasting was invented.
        There are two levels of checks, and I think you're confusing them.
inet6_mc_check() is checking that somebody (*anybody*) has joined the
group on the receiving interface, before delivering the packet to IP.
Delivery to a particular socket depends on source filter settings, if
they are in use, and bindings (only). The socket has a list of joined
addresses to track source filters and to check for correct join/leave
(a socket can't leave a group it hasn't joined), but that list does not
determine delivery of a multicast packet to the socket when source 
filtering
is not in use.
