Okay, i dont know what the difference is, but i can tell you that putting non registered ECC on htat Tyan board is a Bad idea, i did it, the machine was flaky at best. I got reg. ECC and everything is fine.
As far as is this a hardware issue, I run all Athlon machines and have installed redhat on a variaty of boards and chip configuration, and never ahd teh VIA Chipset problems.. I tend to think that there are problems, but they are much agrivated by power cooling, and poor pawer supplies..
