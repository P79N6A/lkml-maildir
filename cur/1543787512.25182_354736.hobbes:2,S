You can use libpciutils (whatever lspci uses) to enumerate
PCI devices  (but I wouldn't, I'd just use lspci :).
You can clone lsusb to enumerate USB devices... but I would
just use lsusb.
You can probably clone 'pnpdump' to enumerate ISA PNP devices.
But I would just use pnpdump.
There's probably a ieee1394/firewire enumeration program.
You won't be able (safely) to discover ISA devices/ports.
(other than "standard" cnipset/motherboard devices)
Anyway, I would just use the existing tools unless there are
things that you must have that they don't provide.
