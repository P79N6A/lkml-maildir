I don't see how would that help.  Both asm and sysdeps/pthread/*.c
versions call __pthread_mutex_unlock_usercnt/__pthread_mutex_cond_lock,
which will DTRT for the mutex passed as second argument to
pthread_mutex_*wait (assuming you have Ulrich's/mine PI nptl patch).
But, there are 2 other futexes used by condvars - internal condvar's lock
and __data.__futex.  If the associated mutex uses PI protocol, then
I'm afraid the internal condvar lock needs to follow the same protocol
(i.e. use FUTEX_*LOCK_PI), otherwise a low priority task calling
pthread_cond_* and acquiring the internal lock, then scheduled away
indefinitely because of some middle-priority CPU hog could delay
some high priority task calling pthread_cond_* on the same condvar.
But, there is a problem here - pthread_cond_{signal,broadcast} don't
have any associated mutexes, so you often don't know which type
of protocol you want to use for the internal condvar lock.
Now, for the __data.__futex lock POSIX seems to be more clear,
all it says is that the wake up should happen according to the scheduling
policy (but, on the other side for pthread_mutex_unlock it says the same
and we still use FIFO there).
