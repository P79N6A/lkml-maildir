Hi there,
First, sorry for my poor english - I am not a native.
I know there have been a thread about this problem few months ago, but as 
far as I see it did not led to any results: 
http://groups.google.com/group/linux.kernel/browse_thread/thread/19116cafe8a20b5/4a28c3b15bb999df
I have the same problem, as described there, with Kingston 2GB SD card. My 
card reader is embedded into Fujitsu-Siemens AMILO Pro V3505 notebook and 
Linux sees it as:
[gophi@amilo ~]$ sudo lspci -vvvs 0a:06.2
0a:06.2 Generic system peripheral [0805]: ENE Technology Inc ENE PCI Secure Digital Card Reader Controller (rev 01) (prog-if 01)

                Status: D0 PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-
This is the one to which the sdhci driver attached, as regards to sysfs:
[gophi@amilo /sys/bus/pci/drivers/sdhci]$ ls -l
razem 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    0 2007-09-29 05:03 0000:0a:06.2 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:0a:06.2

I also have some other devices in system relevant to the card reader - Memory 
Stick reader and one "unknown device":

I have posted some debugging messages from sdhci here (ca. 44 kB): 
http://www.chmurka.net/r/mmc-debug.txt
 
PCMCIA (ide-cs) card reader does not see this card neither, but does not spit 
any error messages - just that the card is not seen in /proc/partitions:
pccard: PCMCIA card inserted into slot 0

On the other side, my Canon A610 camera sees and handles this card properly. 
Also does the usb-storage reader:
