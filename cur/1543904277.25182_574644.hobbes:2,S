the basic problem, and what we use signals for, is:
it is waiting in recv, waiting for the peer to say something.
but I want it to stop recv, and go send something "right now".
I don't want to have two threads for that.
yes we have timeo in place, anyways: we need to detect a failed peer
node in time. we even aim for "sub-second failover" sometimes (which is
not exactly feasible; but failover times of 15 seconds and less are
requirement for useable HA-iSCSI deployments).
but that does not cut it, timeo is seconds.
you don't want seconds latency for IO operations.
so I signal it, it breaks out of recv, then sends, and goes back to recv.
in-kernel epoll would probably solve this.
I don't know how to do that properly, though.

will do.
I was not aware of the "create_singlethread_workqueue",
it does fit our useage good enough.

sure. will be available soon.
this was just a "bust in and see what lkml does about it",
I don't expect to be merged within days :)
I think it is realistic to be merged this year, though...
[as chrismas present, maybe :-)]
