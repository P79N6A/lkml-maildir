   Notes:
     * Several  people  have  requested  the  discussion be linked to LKML 
archives. With this version I've switched from
       locally edited discussion threads to archived links.
     * Great  progress has been made in forward porting IDE driver code 
from 2.4 to 2.5. Several people have tried 2.5.33
       without disaster. Updates continue to be added to the -ac kernels 
and the 2.5 bitkeeper kernels.
     * Floppy  support  appears to have been fixed in 2.5.33-bitkeeper. It 
has been tested, and the corruption previously
       seen has not been duplicated.
     * Support for __FUNCTION__ pasting is being phased out of gcc. This 
has broken compiling in numerous places. Defines
       of the form:
       #define func_enter() sx_dprintk (SX_DEBUG_FLOW, "sx: enter " 
__FUNCTION__ "\n")
       need to be changed to the form:
       #define func_enter() sx_dprintk (SX_DEBUG_FLOW, "sx: enter %s\n", 
__FUNCTION__)
