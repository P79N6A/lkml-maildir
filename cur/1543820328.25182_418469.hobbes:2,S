Most of the Zaurus devices can measure the AC voltage and make sanity
checks on it in the SharpSL Battery/PM code.

Agreed. This is some of the leftover information I'm referring to below.

I'd say millivolts except for the problem of what you do on systems that
don't support voltage readings. Use a very high value I guess. For a lot
of devices millivolts also means in kernel conversion tables. Do such
things belong in kernel or user space?

Where to put AC status and AC voltage readings amongst other things.
Another sysfs class? Also, how do you control suspend/resume
notifications to userspace if not using APM/ACPI?

Agreed, this is something that would be needed.
