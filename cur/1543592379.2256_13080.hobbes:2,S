Your analysis exactly describes what happens in your current
code, though I have to admit that my patch doesn't change it.
Without the patch my workstation (with ~180MB RAM) usually has
between 50 and 80MB of inode/dentry cache and real usable stuff
gets  swapped out.
Either you can go make Linux 2.4 usable again for normal people,
or you can go buy us all a gig of ram.
regards,
Rik
