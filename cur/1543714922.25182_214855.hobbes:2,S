It's a bit more complicated to do get_user, mainly because we use a 64-bit
value to pass the data around already on x86 - the "real data" in %eax,
and the error code in %edx. So you'd need to have a slightly different 
calling convention for the 8-byte case, so it was more than just 
"duplicate the other cases".
I agree that it's an ugly special case. get/put_user should really accept 
all the normal cases, and that includes 'u64'.
Not a lot of code cares, though, so for now we've just had the special 
case. You are the first one to notice, I think.
