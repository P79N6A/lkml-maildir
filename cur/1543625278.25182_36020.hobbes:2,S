Subject: New IBM IDE drive recognized as 40 GB but is 80 GB

Dear kernel hackers,
This problem is on a:
Linux version 2.4.18-pre3-ac1 (root@apu.pf-berlin.de) (gcc version 2.96
We have bought a new IDE hard drive:
hdb: IC35L040AVVA07-0, ATA DISK drive
This is wrongly recognized as 40GB (should be 80GB) drive:
From dmesg:
====================
ide0: BM-DMA at 0xa800-0xa807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
ide1: BM-DMA at 0xa808-0xa80f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: 58633344 sectors (30020 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=3649/255/63,
(U)DMA
hdb: 80418240 sectors (41174 MB) w/1863KiB Cache, CHS=5005/255/63,
UDMA(33)
                       <----> this is wrong
But doing:
[root@apu /root]# cat /proc/ide/hdb/capacity
80418240           <--------------------------------- this is correct
[root@apu /root]#
shows the right capacity.
The CHS counts in dmesg are not the ones physically printed on the
drive. However, a kernel command line "hdb=16383/16/63" did not fix the
problem and resulted in the same GB count.
mke2fs on a fully allocated /dev/hdb1 shows 40GB to me.
Using LVM on the whole drive /dev/hdb same thing, only 40 GB.
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks for your help and a private cc, since I'm no subscriber.
Take Care,
;Martin
