This is getting bloody ridiculous.
Roman, you won't get credited for every nuance of what you've said and done, 
neither will Ingo and Thomas and the many others that work hard to make 
Linux a better Operating System.
I admire the fact that you did pick up the gauntlett and produce code which 
has helped further the whole work.
I keep reading this thread because, against all odds, there is a lot of 
technical progress but the constant bickering really does your credibility 
no favours.
Please stop trying to portray yourself as a victim, those that care will 
form an opinion from your words. Please, please have the grace to rise above 
any perceived 'insults' both actual, and, in my view, mostly insubstantial.
A frustrated lurker, who can't wait for high resolution timers and maybe 
even high precision timers one day.
Thank you, Roman, for all your technical efforts.
