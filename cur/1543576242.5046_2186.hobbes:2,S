That could work, but forget it.  I've just looked at Andrew's patch and
it's much nicer :-)
If you put a spinlock around the list operations in Andrew's version,
you'd have safe tqueue deletions again (if you felt that was worth
having).  Some tricks and you can make it a different spinlock, but I
doubt that would be a net benefit.
