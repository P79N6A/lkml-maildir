You can download NCP documentation from Novell website.  Or you could, 
couple of months ago.  Unfortunately that documentation just describes 
different NCP calls, not transport - to my knowledge transport layer was 
never documented outside of Novell.

Not quite.  If packet signatures are on then server needs to know packet 
you sent so it can correctly compute secret used for next packet (it is 
function of old secret, and data in current packet).  As current 
signatures implementation implement only partial signatures, you need 
just first 64bytes of the packet same - but at that point it may be 
better to just resend packet completely, as write request with correct 
file handle, length, and offset, but with only ~50 bytes of valid data 
is going to do lot of damage on the server.  So I would recommend 
resending original request...
