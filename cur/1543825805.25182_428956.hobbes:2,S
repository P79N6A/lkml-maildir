I am sorry for not responding sooner ... and I am sorry for introducing
a bug here. I think you are right.

Correct. My print_len loses 3 in the 'got log level'-case due to a surplus
substraction. It also loses 3 in the other case due to adding a log level
substring that is not entered in the books.
This is how I would fix it:
         printed_len = vscnprintf(printk_buf, sizeof(printk_buf), fmt, args);
         ...
         if (new_line) {
                 /* The log level token is first. */
                 int loglev_char;
                 if (p[0] == '<' && p[1] >='0' &&
                     p[1] <= '7' && p[2] == '>') {
                         loglev_char = p[1];
                         p += 3;
                 } else  {
                         loglev_char = default_message_loglevel + '0';
                         print_len += 3;
                 }
                 emit_log_char('<');
                 emit_log_char(loglev_char);
                 emit_log_char('>');
Could you confirm, please. I will send a patch to Andrew then.
Or, Andrew, do you prefer a replacement patch for my
statistics-infrastructure-prerequisite-timestamp.patch
that introduces this miscalculation. I could put
statistics-infrastructure-make-printk_clock-a-generic-kernel-wide-nsec-resolution.patch
into that one as well, so that all the timestamp related printk-changes are in
one place.
