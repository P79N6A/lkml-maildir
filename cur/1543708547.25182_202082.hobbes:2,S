It may be both.  I don't think the resistance is to layering
as a general idea.  The resistance is to rigidly (read
explicitly) defined layers.
The 7 (if my memory serves) layer ISO networking definition is
perhaps a better example.  I can't recall hearing of any
implementation with decent performance that conforms to the
ISO definition of the layer boundaries.
What seems a good boundary at one time will likely prove a
poor one later.  Or what may be good in the general can slow
down the whole system because of one specific subsection
where it is suboptimal.
The best is to keep layering in mind (which is already the
case) but to remain flexible, functional specific and
mutable.
