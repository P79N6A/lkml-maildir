Sure, as I mentioned in my email, that'd be _a_ way to do it, but I am not
convinced at all it is the best -- of course, I don't know what could be the
best way to do it; maybe a capability? a per-process tunable in /proc?
another rlimit and we break POSIX? [do we?]
Good thing is - I just found out after reading twice - that FUTEX_FD does
not lock the page in memory, so that is one case less to worry about. 
In this context I was wondering it it really makes sense to worry about too
many threads of a DoS process blocking on futex_wait() to lock memory out.
At least, as an excercise ...

I am starting to think it could be done with no effort -- just off my
little-knoledgeable-head -- let's say it can be done:
In futex_wait(), we lock the page, store it and the offset [and whatever
else] as now, and then releasing just after queueing in the hash table; this
way the page can go wild to swap.
Some other process has locked it, then goes on to do something else and the
page ends up in swap. Whenever we call _wake() - or tell_waiters(), we need
to make sure the page is in RAM - if not, we can page it in (__pin_page()
does it already) and lock it, do the thing, unlock it.
So, this would mean this patch should suffice:

Rusty, Ingo: am I missing something big in here? I am kind of green in the
interactions between the address spaces.
