Hello!
I recently replaced my system board.  My old system had two onboard ide
controllers, with a single 20gb ide drive connected to it.  It also had an
adaptec 2940 with a couple of scsi drives attached.  The cache memory on
the system board went bad, forcing me to replace the board.
With the new system board the filesystems on the ide drive appear
corrupted!  Running 'e2fsck -vnf' on each partition finds lots of
problems.  The scsi drives are fine -- the scsi controller card hasn't
been changed though.
The ide drive is a 20gb with three ext2 partitions, which are 2.5gb, 2gb,
and 5gb and named hda1 hda2, hda5 respectively.
I booted off the slackware-4.0 bootdisk and rescuedisk and then ran
"e2fsck -vyf /dev/hda1"  This command ran forever and reported a large
number of errors. After doing this, hda1 will crash the system after
mounting it and doing "ls /mnt". I ran e2fsck -vnf /dev/hda2 and did the
same for hda5 both hda2 and hda5 report a large number of errors, which I
have attached I also to this message.
hda2 and hda5 will still mount, and things will work fine, except some
files will not open and report back "I/O error".  Also, some files are
450gb and owned by user 1234234 or something crazy like that.  I do not
believe that running 'e2fsck -vyf /dev/hda2' would be wise??  Wait a
minute, I'll find out for sure...
I grabbed a 6gb ide drive, and put one partition which is hdc1.  I then
did, "dd if=/dev/hda2 of=/dev/hdc1" which duplicated the hda2 partition
onto the hdc1 one.  I then did "e2fsck -vyf /dev/hdc1".  Just like with
hda1, the hdc1 partition became even more trashed than before.  I then
reran the fsck on hdc1 again and again until it reported no errors.  I
mounted the partition and discovered that all the data that is there
APPEARS to be intact and correct, yet more than half of the data was
missing.  There must be a better way.
My question is how I might best recover from this corruption.  I am hoping
that this is some kind of c/h/s translation issue, or some similar thing
where I may be able to enter a boot argument and have it recognize the
other system's data layout.  My goal is to read all the data off the drive
and then reformat it and put my data back on.  I have attempted getting
the linux disk editor working on the bootdisk system, but that option
seems kind of unrealistic for recovering all 7 or 8gb.
