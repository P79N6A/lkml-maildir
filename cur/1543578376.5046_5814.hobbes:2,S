Which verion of linux and what libc are you using? For some time now
linux has supported the ability to select and poll on more than 102
FDs and several applications do indeed use this (squid for example).
For large numbers of FDs you probably want poll, which shouldn't give
you any problems. As you point out with sleect you need to redefine
NR_FILE or somesuch -- but hacking the kernel headers shouldn't be
necessary and may not help as libc will stull potentially get the
wrong value.
See where libc gets it from, I think recent libc version may allow
you to do something like:
#define NR_FILE	 <large-number>
#include <blah.h>
#include <blem.h>
but I could be wrong. Using poll you you have no problems.
