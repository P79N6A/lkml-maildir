in your readme you  use the example of making the device root for udev 
/udev ... I thought that was the official suggestion since udev couldn't 
be loaded immediately at kernel boot.

i didn't think udev was responsible for the lack of development, I 
assumed that was due to the lack of devfs adoption in the main stream.
