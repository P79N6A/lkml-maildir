Pointers are (at least on m68k) of known size, so the compiler knows how
much space the struct occupies.
Type checking is by definition futile with void * pointer, but for all
other cases the compiler has all types and sizes it needs at this point.
The actual dereferencing of the symbol table is done by the linker,
which also knows all locations and sizes it needs.
Actually, this is the only way to define circular referencing
structures.
A one-pass-compiler-linker would run into problems.
