Hmm. I've never seen any linux program without usage of syscall's. Any call
via syscall does not make it part of kernel then. (Plese do not talk about
"process space", kernel space and so on -- there are no such terms in GPL).

They are inserted in kernel in runtime via SPECIAL HOOKS (you can not just use
any symbol from kernel in module; it should be exported). It's the same thing
as userspace applicatoions doing (userspace applications are using numbers
while kernel modules using strings to name hooks -- it's irrelevant).

But kernel module is NOT derived work. It's using PUBLISHED interfece and
does not interfere with kernel internals (it can do this due lack of
protection but it's not relevant as well: with such logic you can not have
more then one program in DOS at all).

Hah. They should PROVE IN COURT this :-) Not easy task Iwant to say...
