Well, I hunted down the bug a bit more. The user-mode code DOES get involved.
When /dev/console is open, the pointer is written to vts[line].tty (in
console_open), but noone cares to remove it when it's freed. And I don't
have any process running on line 0. Just I am not sure, weather the correct
way is to avoid freeing the structure (eg. via ref-count) or to remove the
pointer in close_console.
