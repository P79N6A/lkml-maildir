The other changes of your patch are already in the -mm kernel.

I've heard it works with timer 0, and the capability bit on timer 1 is
just wrong.

It's a round trip to the southbridge.  Intel needs about 500 ns.

I'm planning to fix this.
OTOH, the hpet.c implementation has the problem that all interrupt
delays affect the timer, i.e., it isn't precise anymore.

I didn't measure how much reading the RTC registers costs us, but
those aren't likely to be faster.
I'm thinking of a different approach:  Assuming that such a big delay
almost never actually does happen, we run a separate watchdog timer
(using a kernel timer that is guaranteed to work) at a much lower
frequency to check whether the real timer got stuck.  This trades off
the HPET register read against the timer_list overhead (and that we
still lose _some_ interrupts when the worst case happens).
