I received these flames from a friend. Would someone more knowledgeable
field a reply? 
Why on earth don't the linux kernel people look
at 4.4BSD networking code a bit more.  There's
the industry standard, and of course it works.
Why keep reinventing the wheel, why not just go
to *BSD, which is the real thing (UNIX) anyway?
Yahoo, Walnut Creek, etc. have already found this
out :)  I'd like to see any linux do 3000 users
and 1GB of RAM...  Or Solaris, for that matter ;-)
