That's the second test I am normally running. Just running xmms while
doing the kernel compile. I just wanted to check if the system slows
down because of preemption but instead it compiled the kernel even
faster :-) But so far I was not able to test the latency and furthermore
it is very difficult to "measure" skipping of xmms ...

Sorry for not answering immedeatly but I am compiling the same kernel
source with the same .config and everything I could think of being the
same! I even do a 'rm -rf linux' after every run and untar the same
sources *every* time.
