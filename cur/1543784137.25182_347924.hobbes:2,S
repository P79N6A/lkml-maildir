 Why don't we rewrite the Linux kernel in C++?

Of course. Probably the easiest way is
-) to provide a pure C interface (read: write functions with C linkage
   that call your C++ stuff) to your C++ stuff
-) compile your C++ sources separately
-) kill all not-existing features needed by the linker and other
   programs (or implement them in the kernel/your module).

As long as the license agreement does not conflict with the GPL, I can't
see a legal problem. And you can download their source - which is
probably GPL - and put it online wherever you want.
It is inpolite though, IMHO. But it is also inpolite to top-post, break
threads, include meaningless disclaimers, etc.
