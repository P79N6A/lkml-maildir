I see this:
- * Second trick is to special-case the key "0" or NUL.  As seen above, this
- * value indicates an unused slot, so such a value should not be stored in the
- * tree itself.  Instead it is stored in the null_ptr field in the btree_head.
Does that mean that wasn't true, and I can store a 0 key?
