Hi Mikhail,
I'm not quite sure what the problem would be. Please check that you are using
the same config for each kernel, and both kernels have detected the same amount
of memory.
Then, can you start by posting /proc/vmstat before and after running the
synthetic "eater" for some amount of time, with both 2.6.9 and 2.6.10-rc3; so:
boot 2.6.9
cat /proc/vmstat > 2.6.9-pre ; ./eater ; cat /proc/vmstat 2.6.9-post
and the same for 2.6.10-rc3.
Also, /proc/meminfo and /proc/slabinfo output for each kernel before running
eater may give some clues.
Oh, and can you post the source code for the "eater" as well, please?
Thanks,
Nick
