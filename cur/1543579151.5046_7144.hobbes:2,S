Hi,
I am trying to understand the new PCMCIA configuration.  So far I am trying 
to use the kernel PCMCIA driver.  The yenta_socket driver is working fine. 
Using 2.4.0, and cardmgr 3.1.23
When I insert my Iomega Clik drive, cardmgr correctly identifies it as an ATA 
Fixed Disk and loads ide_cs.  ide_cs does the ide_probe and correctly assumes 
that the drive is an ide-floppy.  However at this point it doesn't seem to 
even try to load the module.  KMOD is set to y in .config
If I preload the ide-floppy module everything loads up fine and I can use the 
drive perfectly.  However, when I do a cardctl eject 0, everything screws up. 
The eject command says it works, unlinks ide_cs, but seems to leave 
ide-floppy working!  and yes, I have run depmod -a about a zillion times.
modprobe -nv finds the modules no problem.
Any pointers on where or what is wrong here?
Thanks
