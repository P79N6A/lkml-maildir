With the greatest of respect (which I do have for you Harald), I don't think 
being essentially called a liar is very fair.
I've no reason to not report exactly what I observed and noted and what I did or 
didn't do before noting it, and while you may argue that it doesn't match with 
what you expect, that doesn't mean that I'm making stuff up.  More likely it 
means that neither you or I understand quite what was happening at the time.

It's now four days later.  I wrote the email a few minutes after noting the 
oops, so if I was fiddling with iptables at the time I'm sure I would have said 
so.  I mean, why wouldn't I?
I'll try to reproduce it, but as I've no idea what triggered it in the first 
place it may be a bit tricky.
Noting that a reboot of the box does not even load the ip_conntrack_netlink 
module, which if I was indeed messing with it, I would have probably had to 
force the module to load.  I think I'd know if I was doing that.........

Apologies.  My bad, it's fixed now.
Anyway, let's get to the bottom of the problem rather than get personal about 
what actually happened.
