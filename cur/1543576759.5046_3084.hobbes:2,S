hi!
kernel: 2.4.0.test12
hardware: Adaptec AIC-7892 Ultra 160/m SCSI host adapter (19160)
problem: kernel hangs when using my cdrom with cdparanoia to read cdda data.
(i have nothing else on the bus for now.)
i'd like 2 provide more info, but after 2 *long* fsck ... (maybe tomorrow :-(
i've read about similar hangs on an alpha on this list (same kind of controller)
any solution there ...
Regards,
	Armin
