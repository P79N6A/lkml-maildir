 Obviously I confused defined bits with reserved ones, sorry.  Still the
APIC looks insane for me -- it should really signal an error only once an
interrupt is received, like it does for interrupts from remote sources.

 I checked 3AP and you are right, since we don't need the ESR's value.

 Use apic_write_around() instead as the 11AP workaround -- it was
introduced specifically for this purpose.  Using anything else doesn't
guarantee no back-to-back APIC writes due to interrupts (specifically
writes to the EOI register).
