Yes, I get this, just to make it clear, the test is supposed to throw
things out from the page cache, because this is in part what I want to
test. I was under the impression that (not anymore though) a kernel
compile would be pretty deterministic in how it would pressure the page
cache and how much I/O would result from that.. so, I'm going to try and
change the test.

Just going to put this here, did more tests on 2.6.20.21 (56runs) and
here is the outcome of that:

Mean is 2175s (~36m) and standard deviation 77s.

What I want to test is how compressed caching (compressing the page
cache) improves performance under memory pressure. Now, if I just
compared it to the vanilla kernel and I only had one version of
compressed caching to test with, then that would be fine. But I want to
test some small changes to heuristics that may only change the outcome
by 2-3%. A good starting point for me would be to have a vanilla kernel
and a test that gives me consistent  enough results, before starting to
compare it.
I'm going to try a kernel compile with no parallel processes, the
randomness should become less I suppose :)
