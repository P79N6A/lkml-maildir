Very good spotting.  I have read the code for pci_[un]register_driver
several times, but this did not occur to me.  However I do not agree
with the patch as presented...
This is what I have in 8139too now, before your bugfix...
/* module stays resident iff CONFIG_HOTPLUG and compiled into kernel */
#if !defined(CONFIG_HOTPLUG) || defined(MODULE)
        return (rc > 0) ? 0 : (rc == 0 ? -ENODEV : rc);
#else
        return (rc >= 0) ? 0 : rc;
#endif
Adding your bugfix to this junk will make things even uglier, so I think
that encapsulating all this behavior into a macro of some sort would be
good...
