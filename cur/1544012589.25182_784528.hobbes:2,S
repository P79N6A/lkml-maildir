Yes. And? I can't think of a single case where something could 
absolutely depend on the current relatime semantics, so altering them to 
more usefully match the atime semantics doesn't seem likely to cause any 
trouble.

The use case in this case is the significant body of currently installed 
machines that don't have /tmp on a separate filesystem. In the very 
common setup of tmpreaper being used, the current relatime semantics 
will result in undesired data loss. I think the proposed alteration 
makes the behaviour of relatime massively more useful without any 
obvious drawbacks.
