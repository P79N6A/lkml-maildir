yes, it looks correct in the current tree (it wasn't when 
I'd previously cloned).    It's possible I'm not using bk correctly;
once I've modified a file, 'bk pull' never merges in newer changes 
made upstream.  So I have to 'bk clone' all the time, which is a 
pain in the neck. What am I doing wrong?
