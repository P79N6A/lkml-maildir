Subject: [patch] s390 kprobe fix instruction length calculation

Placing a kprobe on "bc" instruction (s390/s390x) can cause an oops.
The instruction length is encoded into the first two bits of the s390 
instruction.  Kprobe is incorrectly computing the instruction length.
The instruction length is used for determining what type of "fix-up" is 
needed for conditional branch instruction.  The problem can bee seen by 
placing a kprobe on a  "bc" instruction that will not branch.   The 
results is that  Kprobe incorrectly computes the  new instruction 
pointer (psw.addr) after single stepping the instruction.   The problem 
is corrected with this patch.
