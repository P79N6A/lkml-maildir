One could always stuff a seed or per-cpu seeds in the files_struct and
use a PRNG. The only trick would be cacheline bounces and/or space
consumption of seeds. Another possibility would be bitreversed
contiguity or otherwise a bit permutation of some contiguous range,
modulo (of course) the high bit used to tag the randomized range.
With "truly" random/sparse fd numbers it may be meaningful to use a
different data structure from a bitmap to track them in-kernel, though
xor and other easily-computed mappings to/from contiguous ranges won't
need such in earnest.
