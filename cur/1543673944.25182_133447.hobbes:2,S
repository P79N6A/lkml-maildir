ahh so I am reading it wrong... ok but where is the 7mbs going? I think I 
amreading it right this time... and it says that it only uses 385584k as 
opposed to the full 393216k... btw the same thing happens with swap there are 
only 2mbs eaten up from it though... (I have 128mb and I get only 127mb)
