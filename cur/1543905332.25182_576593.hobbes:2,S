The driver still (2.6.20/sky2 1.13) hangs for me (more rarely than in
the past), and cycling the module generally fixes the issues.  I have
supplied all the information that Stephen has asked for, but still no
resolution.  I am not complaining about the lack of a fix, but don't
assume that all it takes to get sky2 working is adequate bug reports.  I
have been and remain willing to test and assist debug, but after several
dropped threads, I feel like the desire or ability to fix this issue
isn't there (and remote debug of an intermittent hardware issue IS
hard), and I didn't want to be a nuisance to someone that has no
obligation to me to address the issue in the first place.
Stability has improved, it's just not there yet.
I'll switch to 1.16 soon, and respond to Stephen's request on netdev for
current issues.
