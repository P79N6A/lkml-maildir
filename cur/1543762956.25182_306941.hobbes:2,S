Hi list,
I have a Dell Poweredge 1600SC with kernel 2.6.11 running and using the ext3
FS + quota v2.
After a while the quota system was running out of sync. This shouldn't be a 
problem, so I decided to turn off quota for a while and rescan my files...
When running the quotaoff utility, it suddenly segfaulted and my /home was 'dead'.
I also noticed that the load of my box was rising very high. After a few minutes 
the whole server was 'dead'.
This is already the second time it occures, with a 2.6.7 kernel and with a
2.6.11 one. I have no clue if it has something to do with the SMP stuff.
Also, I didn't manage to get an crash/oops/whatever log, sorry.
If anyone has seen the same problem or has any idea howto solve this problem,
or howto get more debugging information, please let me know.
