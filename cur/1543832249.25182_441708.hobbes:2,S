I tried instrumenting ich_pata_cbl_detect(), but it turns out that
the chipset is an ICH3M (lspci ID 8086:248A), which ends up down in
piix_pata_prereset which forces a 40-pin:
        ap->cbl = ATA_CBL_PATA40;
Guess that explains that, unless the chipset actually *can* do 80-pin
and has an 80-pin cable (which would be surprising because apparently
none of the other piix variants can...)
