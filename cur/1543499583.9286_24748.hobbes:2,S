Iam trying to implement some procfs code for my driver modeling it after the
scsi procfs code.
iam using proc_lookup() as lookup function in the inode_operations struct
definition. while doing
insmod iam getting these as undefined proc_lookup, proc_readdir etc. 
any idea why these globals are not showing up?
another question: EXPORT_SYMBOL? whats it real use, does it help in dynamic
linking for externs?
or helps symbols showup in /proc/ksyms?
Cheers,
ashokr
Plug-and-Play is really nice, unfortunately it only works 50% of the time.
To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.
