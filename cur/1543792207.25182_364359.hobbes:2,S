I objected to it because it were two days before the release, giving me 
zero chance to deal with it reasonably.

You were commenting on the patches in -mm and I certainly never blocked 
these. I'm actually trying to push these patches since two weeks with zero 
effect.

Christoph, please stop your bullshit. :-(
The first 5 patches are pretty much Al's version, the rest is the 
remaining cleanup by me. I get _no_ help at all with these patches, with 
the effect that my m68k work has gotten to a complete halt and m68k will 
fall behind even further.
bye, Roman
