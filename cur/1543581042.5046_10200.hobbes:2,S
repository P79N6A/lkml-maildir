Under X. Under framebuffer both heads of G400 will work for you if
it is your primary video devices. For capture capabilities see
http://marvel.sourceforge.net
. It for sure worked sometime in the past,
but I'm not sure about current state. But I believe that at least
watching TV works correctly.
And if you insist on X, you can run first head through mga with 
usefbdev /dev/fb0 with hwcursor off, and secondary head through fbdev
/dev/fb1. But it is not supported by me (and neither by XFree guys AFAIK,
not even talking about Matrox support guys) - I support only first head
in X and secondary head used for 'fbtv -k'.

I'm trying... more or less. Next G450 BIOSes will have fix for
matroxfb deadlock on boot, so there is at least some move. Although now
when workaround is implemented in matroxfb, it is a bit late...

BTW, under G450 output to TV is not supported and I'm not sure it ever
will. Output to second monitor is of course supported.
