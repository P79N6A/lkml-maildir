Why?
OSS supports some hardware ALSA doesn't, it's maintained by an 
independent commercial company (4Front) so maintenance isn't an issue, 
and it's portable to many other operating systems.
Functionality and low TCO, what could be better?
New Linux code, including x86_64 3D drivers, was released in April, so 
there's no lack of new features and activity.
