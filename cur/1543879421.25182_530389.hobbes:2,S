It looks like you can traverse arbitrary data structures, yes.
It definitely seems like you can use some kernel functions, but the
ones I saw may just be systemtap facilities. But what is so surprising
about being able to call a kernel function when running in kernel
context? Perhaps there is some fundamental limitation of kprobes that
I don't understand.

Well _you_ do, because that happens to be exactly what you want. Bill
ends up with something that displays page_mapcount instead. And I
end up with something that traverses LRU lists rather than pfns. And
none of it goes in /proc/ or linux-2.6/.
So it isn't really the same thing at all.
