Hmm, interesting.I didn't notice that clocksource_read() is a static
inline.  I was thinking that since it was passing a pointer to a function,
gcc could not assume that it could move that code across it. But now
looking to see that clocksource_read is simply a static inline that does:
  cs->read();
But still, can gcc assume that it can push loads of unknown origin
variables across function calls? So something like:
static int *glob;
void foo(void) {
	int x;
	x = *glob;
	bar();
	if (x != *glob)
		/* ... */
}
I can't see how any compiler could honestly move the loading of the first
x after the calling of bar(). With glob pointing to some unknown
variable, that may be perfectly fine for bar to modify.

So the question here is,can cycle_raw and cycle_last be loaded from
the unknown source that clock points to after the call to
clocksource_read()?
 I'm thinking not.
