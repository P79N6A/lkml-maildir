The NSLU2 people are the ones here that are saying that the driver
should really support LE (because that is what they happen to be
using, the rest of the world runs the ixp4xx in BE), and they keep
saying that it would be so easy to make a patch to add LE support,
but so far they haven't produced such a patch.
Please just write the patch and let's get this over with.
