This sounds reasonable...

... but I have difficulties to understand why page out in order to free
memory
for IO buffers. IMHO, It is ok to use all FREE (=not used by any process)
memory for buffers,  but freeing more memory by paging and then use
it as IO buffers sounds overkill.
And yes, I know nothing about VM internals, so please excuse me if this
is just plain bulshit :-)
