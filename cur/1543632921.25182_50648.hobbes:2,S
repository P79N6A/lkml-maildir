Usually there is an rc script called /etc/rc.d/rc.modules. It
can load modules directly (perhaps this is the case on SuSE and RH),
or it reads the list of modules to load from an independent file
(/etc/modules in Mandrake, for example). In the first case you add
the 'modprobe xxxx' directly in the rc script, and in the second you
just add 'xxxx' in /etc/modules, so you do not modify a system file
and rpm is happy about .rpmnew files.
