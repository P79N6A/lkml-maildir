I submitted a patch ages ago similar (but differnet ;-) ) to this:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/25/69
I couldn't/don't see why I get six ide probes when I know I have only
2 IDE interfaces - I thought it would be better to stick to default
_unless_ the kernel builder knew otherwise and specified the amount.
Alan Cox didn't like it as it introduces more config unnecessary config options.
But it would be nice though if this could be included with that enhancement too.
