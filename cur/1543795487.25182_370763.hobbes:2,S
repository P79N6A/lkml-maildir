I got interested so I started writing a Perl-based replacement that  
actually reads the source config into program memory and writes  
copies out of that RAM each time.  I ran into a problem (although I  
can't reproduce it anymore) where the resultant configs had identical  
options but slightly altered whitespace or ordering, which naturally  
broke the diff method that miniconfig.sh used.

I have a bit of time to tinker.  I'll send you my perl version once I  
get it working and test it out a bit.  It shouldn't be too hard to  
add the ability to use .config and rewrite that when exiting.
One other minor nit:  If you pass a config file from a previous  
version to miniconfig.sh, it will return the full config file because  
nothing makes it match the original.  Theoretically it should  
probably allnoconfig with the full config first and use that for the  
rest, before removing lines.
