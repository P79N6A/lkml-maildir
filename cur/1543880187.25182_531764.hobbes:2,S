So after around commented swiching to GPL v3 it will be possible to start 
work on GLP v3.5 which will allow easy reuse CDDL code under Linux .. good 
to know :o)
How many years it will take ? two, three ? more ? (it will be 
good to know how long we must wait on ZFS under Linux .. I don't belive in 
rewriting ZFS code time and make it so useable on production as *now* it 
is possible under Solaris/*BSD/MOX and passing all pointless arguing will 
take shorter time) .. or maybe never because some people says 
something like "Linux is in GPL cage".
Hmm .. transforming KProbes/systemtap to someting useable as DTrace was 
started more than two years ago and I don't see end of base work (sill on 
start). Make ALSA so useable as OSS it was next three trashed years 
(because some developers stays on position "mixing audio in kernel space 
is dangerous") and also not finished in many points. LVM still isnt't 
Veritas. I don't see OpenVZ to tries be so useable and easy for managa as 
Solaris zoning (why OpenVZ people can't use the same commands syntax for 
manage zones as under Solaris .. command syntax is not patented :). Also 
.. moment .. moment .. for what I'm waiting if I can install and use 
Solaris/*BSD/MOX *NOW* ??? Why still contribute any code to project which 
seems must die ? (Is is realy true that some beeings which can't evolve in 
changeing enviroment will not survive .. ?)
EOT .. sorry
