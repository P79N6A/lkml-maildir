Greetings! :)
Here's hoping that this is the right place to report some nastiness I ran
into today.
The problem: A friend burned a CD for me on his Windows machine, which
blue-screened somewhere along the way. We didn't know whether the burn had
finished or not first. So, I put it into my linux machine, grabbed a handy
`md5sum' and started checking files. After checking a few files from the
CD against the originals on my hard drive, many many messages were being
printed to the console. Following is a short snippet from my
/var/log/messages file:
Why I am writing: I couldn't get the messages to stop. Attempts to umount
the disc were unsucessful (umount, when run as root, hung). The messages
didn't stop when I changed to single-user mode. I had to reboot to make
them stop, and, here is the kicker -- none of my filesystems would umount!
So, coming back up, I faced fsck.
What could I have done differently? (Everything on this machine worked
right off the bat with the generic debian distributed kernel, so I found
no need to recompile and never got around to putting in support for the
SysRq key..  ooh how I wish I had that. Oh well, I lost no data afaict.)
I hope this information helps someone down the line from having to reboot
their machine when a bad CD is put in the drive. :)
Thanks!
