No offense taken. Technology continues marching forward and all that.

There are to my mind two important differences. The first is that
my experiance with Trusted Irix (Trix from here on), which used (uses?)
capabilities and MAC together, is that the granularity is lost on
99 44/100% of programs, programmers, evaluators, admins, and problems.
You just don't get that many cases where it actually gets you anything
to have less than all the MAC capabilities. Applications that care
about MAC to the extent that they use the capabilities tend to use the
lot, if not all the time, in certain circumstances. I'm afraid that
I am not a major fan of fine grained privilege based on my experiance
with it.
The second and perhaps more important reason is that the POSIX
draft assumed a Bell & LaPadula sensitivity model, or at least
a model very much like it. What would CAP_MAC_DOWNGRADE mean on
a Smack system configured:
    OneHand      OtherHand    r---
    OtherHand    GrippingHand r---
    GrippingHand OneHand      r---
What would CAP_MAC_UPGRADE mean, for that matter? It's even worse
to consider that the relationships can change.
CAP_MAC_READ and CAP_MAC_WRITE still make sense, as does
CAP_MAC_RELABEL_SUBJ. But if you have CAP_MAC_WRITE you can
do pretty much the same damage as if you have CAP_MAC_RELABEL_SUBJ,
and the other way around, and if you're not going to use one
of the other capabilities after you find out interesting things
using CAP_MAC_READ it's hard to figure why you'd bother.
Now I know that there are lots of people who don't share my
views on granularity, but I have lots of experiance with this
and the cases where it actually makes sense to break the MAC
capabilities up are rare.
That's my going in position, at any rate. I'm always open to
finding out why I'm wrong.
Thank you.
