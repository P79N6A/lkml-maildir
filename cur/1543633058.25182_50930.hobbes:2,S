I just tried building the I2C stuff in 2.4.18, 
I selected 
	I2C support
and     I2C /proc interface.
as modules.  
The compile went ok, but the depmod after the install claimed that
	i2c-hydra
	i2c-i810
	i2c-via
	i2c-voodoo3
all had undefined externals.
Does someone familiar with the code want to take a look?
