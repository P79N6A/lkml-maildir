Well, I dont have currently an AMD64 test machine so I cannot really help.
With previous implementation, the nimimum shift value was 20 (one megabytes)
If a memnode had a finer range (with chunks not multiple of megabytes), some 
bits of memory could be ignored.
But with your fake node (0-3ef30000), Amul patch may give a shift value of 16.
 Maybe this breaks something in the kernel...
