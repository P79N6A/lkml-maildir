Honestly, I nearly died when I built all those cross-compilers.  Sooooooo
many combinations of gcc/binutils/glibc refused to work for obscure
reasons.  Compilation on x86_64 just didn't work at all and I ended up
having to build everything on a slow i386 box, etc, etc.  The stream of
email to Dan got increasingly strident ;)
I think crosstool has become a lot better since then, judging from the ease
with which Jens was able to spin up the powerpc compiler, but the trauma
was a life-long thing.
Vegard has been making noises about (finally!) preparing and maintaining a
decent set of cross-compilers for us.  It would be a great service (begs).
