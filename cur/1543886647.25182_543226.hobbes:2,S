| And please get rid of the UDF_I_* macro for everything you touch, just
| put a
| 
| 	struct udf_inode_info *uip = UDF_I(inode);
| 
| at the beginning of the function and use the fields directly.
| 
Actually to properly remove UDF_I* and UDF_SB_* macroses in the
whole UDF subsystem - is _lot_ of work. I'm going to make it but
not now (too busy).
