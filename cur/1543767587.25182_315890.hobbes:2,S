This line:
+        static const unsigned int palm  = 28604892;
begins with spaces, not a TAB.
+	if (V4L2_STD_PAL_M  & norm->id) return palm;
Please only 1 space after the _M, and put the return on a
separate line.
Same comments for the next if/return.
And please clean up the next (final :) version with a
clean description and Signed-off-by: line.
