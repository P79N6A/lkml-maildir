That's pretty much what Paulus and I have been advocating all along.
There -might- be a couple of cases where something has a good reason to
do a call that may fail and want to test the result code. For those few
rare cases (though none comes to mind at the moment), then I suppose we
could provide some kind of _try version of the function (or whatever you
want to call it) that doesn't warn and just returns an error.
But as I said, I can't see any such case out of the blue.
Cheers,
Ben.
