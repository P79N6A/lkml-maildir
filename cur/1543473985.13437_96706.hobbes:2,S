Ok, you know the drill by now. This fixes:
 - yes, people told me about the new and improved ksymoops. Much better,
   no need for C++, and this one actually seems to compile and work
   reliably.
 - ntfs fixes
 - the vfat thing _really_ works now
 - NFS fix for deleting files while writebacks active.
 - ppa/imm driver updated
 - minor mm balancing patches
 - Alan took the gauntlet and cleaned up some CONFIG_PROC_FS stuff.
More on Monday,
		Linus
