I'd be happy to take everything back :)  But so far I've only heard
him moaning that
  a) the cryptoloop implementation you submitted is the worst possible
     one (without any backing)
  b) the changes proposed by akpm and me would break external modules
     (which they would, but that's life and we've never cared much
     about outside drivers) und would make them slower which is
     utterly bogus.
But hey, let's give him time to defend himself..
