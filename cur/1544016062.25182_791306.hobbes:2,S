Hello,
Is there a way to boot a normal standard home x86 dual core PC with two 
different Linux Kernels without a hypervisor?
The idea is of course to give the Kernels their own address space and 
their own rootfile systems, the devices would be unique for each kernel etc.
Can this be done with a standard BIOS and GRUB/LILO?
