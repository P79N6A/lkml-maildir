Yes, and this is the rate at which jiffies must tick.
At no time should jiffies be more than one tick away
from the value it would have according to HZ.
(where "tick" is the slower of the two)

You choose one. If you have sucky hardware, that's the
best that can be done.
If by "lacks digits" you mean something like the 24-bit
cycle counter on the Alpha, faking a 64-bit counter is
not terribly hard. I've seen it done for the SHARC DSP.
You'll just need an interrupt before roll-over.

I could run the interrupts at 4152.0625 Hz and still
produce a jiffies tick at 1000.0000 Hz over the long
term. At any given point in time, jiffies won't be
off by more than 1 tick.
I could run the interrupts at 666 Hz too, and not be
off by more than 2 jiffies ticks.
Having the interrupt frequency be _almost_ equal to
the HZ value is kind of bad, because it tempts people to
equate them. When the frequencies are really different,
the errors and solutions become more obvious.

Less than 1/HZ off, yes. That's 1 millisecond max error
over any time period from nanoseconds to years.

You can not use a variable clock. End of story.
Well, if you do, you pay the price. (time goes crazy every
now and then, until a very-forgiving ntpd adjusts things)
This would not be a sane default.
If you want high-res time on a PC, your choices:
a. read the PIT registers (slow)
b. have a PC with the HPET
c. have a PC with a stable TSC
d. some ACPI PM thing?
If your hardware isn't suited for high-res time,
nothing will save you. Linux got along OK for a
decade without high-res time at all; you'll live.
