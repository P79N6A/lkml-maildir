Hi Net,
we are planning a questionnaire study on the Linux
development process and therefore need your input.
The goals of our study are:
* to understand the motivations of Linux developers
* to analyze how cooperation in a successful Open Source
  project works
* to make these working principles explicit so that they can be
  further discused, optimized, and perhaps also transfered to
  other Open Source projects
* to provide a solid statistical base for theories of e.g. ESR
The study itself will follow Open Source principles. This means 
that all information and data of our study will be publicly 
available at the project's homepage:
        
http://www.psychologie.uni-kiel.de/linux-study
(There is also more information about our project.)
Moreover, the development of the questionnaire itself will 
follow Open Source principles in order to better integrate 
the various experiences of Linux developers. Therefore, we 
are anxious to learn more about your thoughts and ideas which 
processes, principles, or motivations you think are necessary
to enable successful software development in the Linux community.
Since such a discussion is off-topic on linux-kernel, we invite 
interested developers to join our mailing list:
         linux-study@mlab.psychologie.uni-kiel.de
To subscribe to the linux-study mailing list, send a mail 
containing "subscribe linux-study" (without quotes) to
majordomo@mlab.psychologie.uni-kiel.de .
Looking forward to your ideas and comments,
Sven Niedner   Stefanie Hermann   Guido Hertel
