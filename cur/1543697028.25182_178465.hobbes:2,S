Well, why not head into the right direction at least? If we didn't try that
before we would probably have never left caves ...

Separate config diffs from original packages into new <project-config> package.
This way one can at least try to merge a new version of some rpm with a
standard distro config. diffs don't do that all to well.

Sorry, if there is a bug in the package I expect the maintainer to fix it and
the distributor to help him (tell him about the problem, send patch
suggestions, whatever...).

This is probably one reason why quite a significant amount of
distro-patches/addons are quite questionable (at least). The distro-people
cannot accept that they see only their part of the whole picture and only
_think_ that they know perfectly well what joe-average-user wants, has and
needs. In fact they mostly have no idea. 
Debian could be a real win in this area if they only avoid others'
super-smartness.
