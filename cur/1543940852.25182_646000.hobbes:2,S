Please prefer to put not-for-the-changelog text after the "^---" rather
than prior to the changelog.
When fixing compile errors and warnings, please always quote the compiler
output so we can see what is being fixed.
This patch doesn't apply to my tree and UDF presently compiles OK.  And it
compiled OK in 2.6.24-rc8-mm1 so I am at a loss to know what's going on
here.
Please check 
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/
 with your mysteryconfig
and see if we still need any fixes.   Beware that this mmotm snapshot is full
of git conflicts which I haven't bothered fixing (because they're different each
time I pull the trees).  But UDF compiles OK.
