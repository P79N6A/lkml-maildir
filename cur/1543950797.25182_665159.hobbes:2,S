Subject: [PATCH] x86_64 ptrace orig_ax on ia32 task
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/7/358

This makes 64-bit ptrace calls setting the 64-bit orig_ax field
for a 32-bit task sign-extend the low 32 bits up to 64.  This
matches what a 64-bit debugger expects when tracing a 32-bit task.
This follows on my "x86_64 ia32 syscall restart fix".
This didn't matter until that was fixed.
The debugger ignores or zeros the high half of every register slot it
sets (including the orig_rax pseudo-register) uniformly.  It expects
that the setting of the low 32 bits always has the same meaning as a
32-bit debugger setting those same 32 bits with native 32-bit
facilities.
This never arose before because the syscall restart check never
matched any -ERESTART* values due to lack of sign extension.  Before
that fix, even 32-bit ptrace setting orig_eax to -1 failed to trigger
the restart check anyway.  So this was never noticed as a regression
of 64-bit debuggers vs 32-bit debuggers on the same 64-bit kernel.
