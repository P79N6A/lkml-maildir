They all use the page cache, but they still use different address spaces.
The block device and getblk share the same address space, so the metadata
and the block device are on the same cache, except for ext2 directories,
which act like files do.  Each file has its own address space, so that
isn't coherent with the block device.
In other words, block device reads with the FS mounted will probably
never give consistent results.
The bug where dump could corrupt things was when getblk and the
block device both used the buffer cache.  That issue hasn't changed.
