Agreed.
I will have a look at the URLs you passed along.  I was talking to a
colleague about this just after I sent the initial message and the number of
places where this would be useful suddenly became much more apparent to me
:)  For example, _ANY_ daemon process could be notified of configuration
changes when they happen, mail servers/spoolers would have immediate access
to the locations of files, without tying up the disk with polling.  All and
all a very good idea (and its not even mine anymore it would seem, so I can
say that! :))
Thanks again,
Sean
