Ok, you convinced me here, we might want to add start/pause methods to
the class devices.

I do not think so. struct device manages real hardware and converts
data flow into in-kernel format. class device represent abstractions
the kernel presents to userspace. They normally have a dev_t number
associated with them and a specific (or several) protocol/interface
for accessing them. You are trying to mix it all together. Why does a
PCI device need a dev_t? Or i8042? They don't. Do they need multiple
interfaces? No, they don't. Does a network device needs to know about
multiple power management levels? No, it does not.
I am pretty sure there is a way of getting class devices into suspend
without merging these 2 abstractions. In fact, why can't we have all
class devices stopped first and then suspend all "real" devices? Then
we'd have 2 lists, one for class devices and another for devices.

Define failed? You just said you did not like it and ended up with
current code where individual class devices override in-kernel
interface (methods, attributes) specified by the class itself. In the
end we had to require updated version of udev anyway ;(

The classification is still flat. You are allowing to move and stack
devices within /sys/devices/... subtree but the /sys/class/... is
flat.

I am not concerned with you making changes to input system, I question
the need of such sweeping changes throughout all subsystems. If my
patch (plus possibly adding 2nd list for class devices for
suspend/resume) is sufficient then we do not need these core patches
in mainline and don't need to change subsystems.

I do not think being in -mm is enough justification for changes to the
driver core design. they do not appear to break stuff, here I agree,
but it does not mean that the design is proper.

Yes, everyting involving merging calss_device and device is a bit premature IMO.
