I followed that link and the second and third lines seemed *very* interesting.
I looked at that patch:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.4/patch@1.1447.1.19
and back ported it to our 2.4.18 tree (very easy) and that fixed the
problem.
The file was in arch/ppc/8260_io/fcc_enet.c, however the 8260_io directory
became cpm2_io in later versions.
Thanks very much, Tim!
