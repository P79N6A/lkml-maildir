OK, thanks, please ignore this patch (it was more the question anyway).
So. currently the meaning of->curr_target is: remember the last thread
we sent a signal, may help to avoid iterating over the thread group when
the next signal is sent.

Can't understand why I didn't realize this while reading the code.
Looks like a reasonable cleanup regardless.
