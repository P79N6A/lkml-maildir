Can anyone tell me why pd.o depends upon paride instead of epat.o. I'm
trying to setup my conf.modules and the options as follows:
options pd drive0=0x378,0,0,-1,0,1,0,-1
It works great as long as I manually change what pd.o depends on in
modules.dep. Is there a way I can permenatly change the dependancy?
Thanks,
Chris
