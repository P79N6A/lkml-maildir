As I said, it is Centrino-based, with 1.3GHz Pentium M:
processor	: 0
vendor_id	: GenuineIntel
cpu family	: 6
model		: 9
model name	: Intel(R) Pentium(R) M processor 1300MHz
stepping	: 5
cpu MHz		: 597.592
cache size	: 1024 KB
fdiv_bug	: no
hlt_bug		: no
f00f_bug	: no
coma_bug	: no
fpu		: yes
fpu_exception	: yes
cpuid level	: 2
wp		: yes
flags		: fpu vme de pse tsc msr mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 tm
bogomips	: 1192.75
Note the current CPU MHz sticking to ~600 -- it is cpufreq's result.
