I've reported problems with -next and ftrace. The timestamps look very similar 
to what I've seen as well. I don't have those kernels available anymore - I 
decided to wipe my system and move to a distro where it's easier to test new 
kernels.
However, it stands to reason that it isn't ftrace actually causing the 
problem.

That is quite similar... I'm on a Core2Duo (Dell Inspiron 1420 laptop) and was 
seeing the problems with GCC4.3 and a pure 64bit userland.

Dialup is like pissing through a pipette. Slow and excruciatingly painful.
