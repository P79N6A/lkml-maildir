That case law can be safely ignored in the US, since it was superseded by 
real law, passed in 1980.  Per section 117 of Title 17 of the US Code:
- ----------------
(a) Making of Additional Copy or Adaptation by Owner of Copy. — 
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an infringement 
for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the 
making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program provided:
	(1) that such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step
	in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine
	and that it is used in no other manner, or
- ----------------
So copies to disk and RAM that are "an essential step in the utilization of 
the computer program" are non-infringing.
	Shawn.
