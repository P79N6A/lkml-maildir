Subject: [PATCH] oprofile per-cpu buffer overrun
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew,
In a ring buffer controlled by a read and write positions we
can't use buffer_size but only buffer_size - 1 entry, the last
free entry act as a guard to avoid write pos overrun. This bug
was hidden because the writer, oprofile_add_sample(), request
one more entry than really needed.
regards,
Phil
