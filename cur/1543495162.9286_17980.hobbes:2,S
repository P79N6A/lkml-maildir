	No, more likely having "big" cisco switch with Giga-Ether port(s)
	costs so much that they didn't even think of it..  Check what cisco
	WS-C2948G costs to you.  2x GE ports, 48x 10/100 BaseTX ports.
	(No need to get those high-end WS-C5***, WS-C6***, or WS-C85**
	 series boxes.)
	Of course they might not have had a visit from a marketroid over
	last 3 months what that C2948G has been available, so perhaps they
	just don't know of them...
	With that kind of "middle-hardware" it does not matter that the
	clients don't have GE ports.
	Of course in real life I would use Ether Channel bonded group of
	interfaces if I have a *large* number of clients, or more likely
	just simply multiple interfaces with separate addresses, and DNS
	round-robin (or manual setup) to give out those addresses to the
	clients to distribute the load evenly among the interfaces.
	(The Ether Channel does use *one* interface towards given MAC
	 address, so doing balancing by using separately addressed inter-
	 faces gives the same result -- possibly even better when making
	 balancing manually controlled, and thus possibly perfectly
	 evenly distributed.)
