It all depends on the name of the patch. Usually, the '-preXX' patches
are 'previews' of the thing, so a 2.4.3-pre8 is 'preview 8 of what could
be 2.4.3', so as 2.4.3 still does not exist, the patch applies on 2.4.2.
On the other way, the Alan Cox series  is named 2.4.2-acXX, because they
add features to test to 2.4.2 that anybody knows if will end on an 'official'
kernel. Perhaps if a bugfix-feature that appears in 2.4.2-acX is ok, it
can end up in the official preview 2.4.3-preY for the next kernel.
