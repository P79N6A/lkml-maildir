I wouldn't touch memory overcommit if you are already seeing out of memory
issues.  If you are using lots of pagecache, I would suggest increasing
inactive_clean percent, reducing the pagecahce.max value, and modifying the
bdflush parameters in the above document such that bdflush runs sooner, more
often, and does more work per iteration.  This will help you move data in
pagecache back to disk more aggressively so that memory will be available for
other purposes, like heap allocations. Also if you're using a Red Hat kernel and
you have 16GB of ram in your system, you're a good candidate for the hugemem
kernel.  Rather than a straightforward out of memory condition, you may be
seeing a exhaustion of your kernels address space (check LowFree in
/proc/meminfo).  In this even the hugemem kernel will help you in that it
increases your Low Memory address space from 1GB to 4GB, preventing some OOM
conditions.

Cached memory is freed on demand.  Just because its listed under the cached line
below doesn't mean it can't be freed and used for another purpose.  Implement
the tunings above, and your situation should improve.
