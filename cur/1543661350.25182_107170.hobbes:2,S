Take a look at all the embedded Linux distributions.  There are 
solutions for this out there.  I haven't looked into them as I just 
stuck a hole PC into my robot.
The issue with ROM style data storage is once written, any changes 
require replacement of the devices.  That adds up after a few revisions. 
  All motherboards once had PROMS (usually windowless EPROMS) for 
storing the BIOS.  It is just the cost of FLASH type devices has come 
down to the point where they are cheep when you look at the costs of 
going about it some other way.
