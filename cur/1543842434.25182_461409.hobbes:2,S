No, the module does not ever know that userspace is even _using_ udev,
let alone care if it is finished or not.

Kay does have some thoughts as to this idea, but it's more like using
the kernel to relay those "all done" events from udev back out to
whoever wants to hear it.

That's why people are switching to event driven startup logic, which
makes all of this not an issue anymore.  See
	
http://www.netsplit.com/blog/2006/09/01
for one such example of a system that can handle the above situation
just fine.
"normally", udev creates those device nodes just fine, and fast enough
for your first example to work.  But if you don't want that, use
'udevsettle', which will wait until udev is finished:
	modprobe rd
	/sbin/udevsettle
	mkfs /dev/ram0
It's in use already today by some startup scripts that don't want to
switch over to being event driven.
