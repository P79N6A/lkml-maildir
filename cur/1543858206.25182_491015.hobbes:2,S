Let's just say the behavior has changed.  It now returns
-EINVAL instead of -ENOTTY when the msdos IOCTLs fail.

That's when this happens: running certain programs that try
msdos-type IOCTLs on native Linux filesystems.

If there aren't any other problems you can just turn off the logging.
Did you change something else?
Anyway, here is a much simpler patch that restores the previous
behavior (but leaves the message.)  However if you aren't having
any problems now other than the messages maybe there's no real
problem after all?
