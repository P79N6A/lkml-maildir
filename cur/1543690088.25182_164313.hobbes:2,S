No.  Currently kernel is supposed to be GNU C.  Using C89/C99 constructs
instead of GCCisms is fine and a good idea where it makes code more readable
and doesn't degrade performace.  Adding hacks for propritary compilers is
a very bad idea.
I can't see how you can compile the kernel with theses few changes without
inline assembly anyway..
Could you try to test your RELOC_HIDE version with various gcc versions
and maybe as some gcc gurus whether it's fine?  It would defintily fall
into category (1) above.  You'd need to come up with something nicer for
barrier(), though..
