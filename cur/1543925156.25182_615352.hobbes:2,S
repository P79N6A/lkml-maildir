You are right, seems no dma lines in adapter. hda=nodma helped, no errors 
anymore. I will try now also libata_dma_mask and will mail result. Btw there 
is no notes in Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt about it.
In any case it is complete board, WRAP.2C made by PCEngines in 2003. Kind of 
popular and mass produced, before was widely used by StarOS, probably known 
GPL violator, who didn't bother himself to supply patches, but at same time 
used it in his projects.
If it is valid for all board with this revision, maybe it is better to put it 
in some kind of fixup/quirk/black list, or how it is called?
