Hi,
Did you happen to be running a disk I/O intensive operation at around the
time these messages started to appear?  Or perhaps something like 'find /
-name "*" -print'?  Or were you accessing certain files frequently in a
short period of time?  You may have encountered the filesystem corruption
bug, though I though that it wasn't present in kernels before 2.2.8.
