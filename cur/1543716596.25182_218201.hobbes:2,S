The SELinux flush_unauthorized_files code is based on flush_old_files in
fs/exec.c.  It is only executed upon a SID/context transition to flush
files that are not authorized for the new SID/context, and sharing of
the open file table across such transitions requires a share permission
that is only allowed where absolutely necessary, e.g. kernel->init.  Do
we need to change the code?
