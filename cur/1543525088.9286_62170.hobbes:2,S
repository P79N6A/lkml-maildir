Heuristics like these are BAD. The heuristicsfor trying to limie buffer
cache and page cache were one of the reasons that we tended to suck at
specweb, because it silently just didn't use available memory for caching.
Don't limit what the memory is used for - let the dynamics of the
allocators do the best they can. If there are problems with the
_freeing_ of the memory, that is what should be fixed, not this.
