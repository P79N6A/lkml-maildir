I'm living on the planet where filtering is not possible, unless you
want to have oodles of unmaintanable tables for different devices. And
that means that if you don't trust a user with your cdrom currently,
don't give him/her access to it.

Yes I know.

Then we should require raw io capability, as I've stated I'm fine with
that. I'm not fine with filtering.

Well they can't, it's a block layer property. The only thing the device
sees is a regular struct request.
