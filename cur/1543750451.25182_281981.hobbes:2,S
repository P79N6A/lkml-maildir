I'd rather not see this driver merged at this point. It's completely
lacking support for class devices, which means it will not work
with udev. Also, I'm still feeling the interface should much more
resemble Posix shared memory rather than 'use sysfs to create a
character device per shared memory segment'.
Ideally, we should have some user interface that also makes sense
for cross-guest shared memory on UML/Xen/etc.
Regarding the use of sysfs, I also think the memory segment
'devices' should share the name space with the ones used in dcssblk,
since they are actually the same resources, just used by different
device drivers. So instead of having
/sys/block/dcssblk/dcssblk0/device -> ../../../devices/dcssblk/foo
/sys/devices/dcssblk/foo/
/sys/devices/dcssshm/bar/
it rather should be
/sys/block/dcssblk/dcssblk0/device -> ../../../devices/dcss/foo
/sys/class/dcssshm/yourseg/device -> ../../../devices/dcss/bar
/sys/devices/dcss/foo/
/sys/devices/dcss/bar/
I'd really like to hear an outside opinion on this.
Since Carsten is currently on vacation, he won't be able to reply
too soon, so I suggest we postpone this for now.
Carsten, sorry I couldn't look over this before Heiko sent it out,
the next evening out is on me.
There are also a few smaller nits I'd like to pick:

This seems to be getting out of the original scope. I don't know
if anything better exists already, but I don't think registering
bus devices at the /sys/devices should depend on architecture
specific code. Either we agree that such a function is needed
for all architectures, or we should stop using it.

IMHO, it would be better to use pr_info/pr_debug for new code.

If you move all functions into call graph order, you don't need any forward
declarations and at the same time it becomes obvious that there are no
direct recursions.

Maybe it's just me, but these edge-triggered event attributes in sysfs
feel wrong.

It may be better to have two structures here, on that embeds the device
and one that embeds the cdev and class_device.

Slightly inconsistent indentation here.

AFAICS, there is still a tiny race against module unload here:
module_put(THIS_MODULE) is practically always a bug!

This can probably be done much simpler using idr.

Why use kmalloc for this, when the buffer must not exceed 9 bytes?

huh?

iminor(inode) ?

Why the extra use count?

Is seek actually useful if you don't have read/write?

Why the limit to 256 segments? The rest of the driver appears
to be written to avoid such limitations. Also, using goto for
error handling, like in the other functions, would make this more
readable.
