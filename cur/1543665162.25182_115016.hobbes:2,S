There is no safety with __set_current_state().  It is just an
abstraction.
The safety comes from set_current_state(), which ensures memory
ordering.
This is an issue not just on SMP, but on a weakly ordered processor like
Alpha.

You only use __set_current_state() if you know you do not need to ensure
memory ordering constraints.
