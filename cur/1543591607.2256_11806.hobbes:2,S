Well...  Around here we've been used to Microsoft translations like:
ETES-VOUS CERTAIN [O/N] ?
... and of course pressing 'o' doesn't work while 'y' does.  :-)
Wanting to localize such low-level keywords is utopia.  Otherwise you'll
want to translate command names like free, rm, mv, etc. and yet programming
languages as well like C keywords.  And then you come to a point where
nothing could be interoperable any more.
