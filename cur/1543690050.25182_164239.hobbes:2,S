Yeah, I didn't think his comment was very helpful since I thought it was 
clear that I was working on a draft of an IDEA.

Well...
Since I don't know enough about the actual kernel, I thought perhaps I 
could start with writing a generic neural net that could be added to the 
kernel.  The fact that I need an integer-only algorithm will require 
that I largely start from scratch.
I also need to refresh my memory on how to do back-propogation.
Oh, and most importantly, I need ideas from others so I don't go down 
the wrong path.
