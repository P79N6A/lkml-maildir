Hi Matt,
Here's a couple small tweaks.  The first is to netpoll_setup.  The settle
time was too short for my e100, and the system would hang.  The second
is to netconsole so that it registers a console with CON_PRINTBUFFER.
This helps debugging early bootup issues where you want to capture data
from before netconsole is initialized.  Perhaps it should be a param
to netconsole?
thanks,
-chris
