The steps I followed to arrive at those numbers was the Ultra-DMA HOWTO:
    
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/Ultra-DMA-5.html#ss5.1
Once I had recompiled a new 2.4.20 with all the goodies, the ide2=
parameter became unneeded.  At least, I can boot without it.  Still having
GRUB problems, but no additional drive errors lately.  (Knock on wooden
backup tapes.)
I will try and do the other steps this week.
Thanks,
Phil
