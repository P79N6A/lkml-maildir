A two-line workaround is the patch of my post:
Subject: [PATCH] DVD-RAM rewritable again
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=109156820507518
That takes our 2.4 closer back to the bogus status quo ante for
CDROM_CAN(CDC_DVD_RAM) drives i.e. pass writes thru to all discs
inserted into such drives.
