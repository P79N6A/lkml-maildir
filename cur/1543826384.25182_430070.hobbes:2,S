Well, when the locks are released at one place, I don't buy that it make
the code any easier to understand.  However, I understand that it makes
it easier for the validator to do its job, so I'm happy with all three
parts of the patch.  I'll push it to the -mm tree.

I understand the warning.  jfs is taking the same mutex (commit_mutex)
on two inodes, which has the potential to for two threads to deadlock.
I believe the order the locks are taken is safe (always taking the
parent first).  In fact, I think any operations involving more than one
inode are already protected by i_mutex on the parents.  I'm sure I can
fix it with mutex_lock_nested.
