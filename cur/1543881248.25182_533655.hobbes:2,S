Was thinking of it but platform_device is better for migration purposes. Hence,
assuming somebody would want to have pcmcia working not bothering to add whole arch/powerpc support,
it can be accomplished quickly. OTOH, further change from pd to of_device is not hard as well. So far, most ppc stuff (if not all) still existing both in ppc/ and powerpc/ paths, and to keep consistency platform_devices are used here and there. So, with pd approach arch/ppc/ boards are encouraged to get source device/driver bus ready, hereby simplifying transition to of_device later.
With current bootwrapper activities it may happen sooner, but there are many places in kernel nobody want to move for almost zero value..
