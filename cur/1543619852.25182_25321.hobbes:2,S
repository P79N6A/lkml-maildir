Hi, All,
	I want  to know how a raw packet passes the chain of iptables.
	Here are the iptables chains
--->PRE------>[ROUTE]--->FWD---------->POST------>
        Conntrack    |       Filter   ^    NAT (Src)
        Mangle       |                |    Conntrack
        NAT (Dst)    |             [ROUTE]
        (QDisc)      v                |
                     IN Filter       OUT Conntrack
                     |  Conntrack     ^  Mangle
                     |                |  NAT (Dst)
                     v                |  Filter
	So how a raw packet go through these chains?
	Thanks!!
