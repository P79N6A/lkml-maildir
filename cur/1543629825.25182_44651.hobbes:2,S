Hello,
I am having problems with a sound card. When I play a sound the machine becomes
frozen.
sndconfig tells reports an Ensoniq|ES1371 [AudioPCI-97]
After my machine recovers from the frozen stage I read the following in
/var/log/messages:
May  7 21:34:58 plato kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 0,
scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 Write (10) 00 01 05 aa 19 00 00 26 00 
I am running RH7.2 with kernel  2.4.7-10
Is this a problem of the kernel or of the sound card driver? How can I get
around this problem?
Any help will be greatly appreciated, Joaquin
