I'm not try to advocate on Solaris or on Linux. I'm interested to 
incorporate DTrace like solution in Liunux.

What about zoning (which seems is much more than simple jailing) ? What 
about zfs which will be probably will next comparable to DTrace step 
forward ? (probably will come with next express build). On big computers 
Solaris also have much more better scaleability than Linux (I'm offen 
smile when I'm see questions like "Is Linux enterprise ready ?" ;). On 
small servers Linux is good alternative or in many cases is comparable (on 
choosing OS can decide another not stricte technical things) or is 
slightly better solution (for exemple now much more easied find well 
skilled adminis on Linux than on Solaris) but on medium or large computers 
(workgroup and higher solutions) stll in mamny cases is worse or much more 
worse solution for example in hardware utilization and needed 
funcitionalities (I'm talking about Linux vs. Solaris on sparc and also on 
x86 platform). Even on two way systems Solaris (10) still *much more*
*better* handles threads ..
For me isn't so importand how many hardware correctly handles this or 
another OS. If choosen OS handles correctly my hardware I'm quite happy
(in my case Linux still can't handle SunSwift T1000 NIC on my E250 ;o)
