It shows what the kernel is currently is doing and where it's spending the 
time.
First, your kernel buffer log buffer seems a little small, so not 
everything is captured. Could you increase the number in the "Kernel log 
buffer size" option (it's in the "Kernel debugging" part of the "Kernel 
hacking" menu).
Second, could you press ALT+PrintScreen+P a few more times (maybe around 
10 at least) while the kernel hangs? This would should where the cpu is 
spending its time and whether it's at a single place or at different 
places.
Thanks.
bye, Roman
