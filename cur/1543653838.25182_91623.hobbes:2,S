Looking at the patch (not testing it), as far as I can tell we'll return a 
basically random number that is just whatever the anonymous super-block 
was allocated, right?
I'm not convinced that returning random numbers to user space is
necessarily a great idea.. That said, I think we already do it for unnamed
pipes anyway, so I'm more wondering if we should have some way to map
these numbews (in user space) to a valid thing, so that they wouldn't just
be random numbers.
(In other words: I like the patch, and I'm not really complaining about
this new behavour at all. It's just the "randomness" as far as user space
goes that bothers me a bit, since it seems to imply bad interface design).
