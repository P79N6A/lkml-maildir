Subject: [PATCH 002 of 20] knfsd: nfsd4: build rpcsec_gss whenever nfsd4 is built
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Select rpcsec_gss support whenever asked for NFSv4 support.  The rfc
actually requires gss, and gss is also the main reason to migrate to v4.
We already do this on the client side.
