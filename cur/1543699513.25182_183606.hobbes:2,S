Hi Oliver, I'm a bit confused about the locking rules.  I suppose
(1) If both subsys.rwsem and dev->serialize are taken, then
subsys.rwsem must be taken first.
(2) dev->serialize atomizes changes to the struct usb_device.
Why then is dev->serialize not taken in usb_reset_device
(except in a dud code path)?
Also, why isn't dev->serialize enough to protect against
probe() during usb_reset_device?  After all, won't
dev->serialize be held during the probe calls (I didn't
check this and I'm in need of coffee - I hope I'm on the
right planet...)
Ciao,
Duncan.
