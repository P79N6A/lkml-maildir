2.6.14-rc4-kj1 aka "I ran out of bad ideas" patchset is out. You can
get it from usual place: 
http://coderock.org/kj/2.6.14-rc4-kj1/
Full shortlog of who did what is also available:

* __nocast patches were reworked to use gfp_t facility. Hmm... subject
  lines were left intact.
* ext3 + CONFIG_QUOTA=n patch was merged and dropped in between.
It's nice to see new people sending small things to our list.
