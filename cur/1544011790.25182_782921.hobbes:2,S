You are right, this patch should have been delayed to .29. Should i rebase 
the branch?
Joerg has been doing stress-tests of the iommu driver and these fixes are 
the result of that. I pulled three patches from Joerg in one group, and 
the other two were real fixes - and this one looked indeed unnecessary but 
harmless, so i didnt ask him to rebase. CONFIG_AMD_IOMMU is default-off 
and a relatively new driver, and the patch came from the hw vendor 
affected by it so i let it through. When i pulled i assumed i could get it 
in before -rc9 but once you released -rc9 the pull was done already. I 
wouldnt have pulled such a patch so close before final .28. The timing was 
a bit unfortunate - can rebase and re-test. Same deal for:
   55aab5f: x86 gart: don't complain if no AMD GART found
i wouldnt have put it in after the final -rc.
