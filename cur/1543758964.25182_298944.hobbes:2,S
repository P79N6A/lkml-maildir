I don't know, because we've never tried it.  One can only speculate, and
I'd speculate that the kernel would end up pretty crappy because there
would never be a point in time when the thing was sufficiently usable.
The need to periodically lock things down and concentrate on stability and
generally get our act together every couple of months is good discipline
even if we're only making a technology, IMO.  And it gets more testers.

That could work.  The releases are slowing down as we spend longer wringing
out bugs.  Six months would be a bit excessive though.
But before solutions are discussed, we need to work out what the question was.
What are we trying to fix, and why?
