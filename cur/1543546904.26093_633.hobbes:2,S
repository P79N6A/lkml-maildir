Umm...
	a) WTF do we export it?
	b) we are using the same thing in do_signal() on all architectures.
	c) generating ELF coredumps and exec.c::must_not_trace_exec() are
vulnerable too.
	d) Where do we initialize ->p_pptr if test in the beginning of
do_fork() fails? If my reading is right we have a lot more to worry about -
blind access to ->p_pptr->foo happens in quite a few places.
	e) ptrace and signal code for different architectures seem to share
a _lot_ of code. Is there any real need to duplicate it to hell and back?
I didn't look deep enough into the details (yet), but it looks like a job
for several helper functions in the arch-independent code, no?
