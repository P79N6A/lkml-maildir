Hi!
2.6.5 kernel. I did some pretty long and very disk intensive
lingvistics job, then ^Z stopped it, and ran sync. sync was not
returning for few minutes, I ran second one but it hang too. I ran
second sync, but it appeared hanged too. I told lingvistics job to
quit early, and then both syncs finished. Anyone seen something
similar?
