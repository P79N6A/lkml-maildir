For in-tree drivers, it broke the compilation of any drivers that relied 
upon it, and they were then fixed, and most of the fixing occurred 
before the changes made it into any widely used tree.  That 
break-it-and-fix-it approach is typically seen as flagging enough.  If 
your driver isn't in-tree, it's invisible to kernel maintainers.
For out-of-tree drivers, your best bet is to follow Jonathan Corbet's 
notes on LWN.  He's pretty good about describing impending widespread 
breakage before it hits the main tree.
