Yah, me too ;)

I would prefer to do nothing right now.  We can implement the general
interface but keep the pte_chain_lock abstraction.  Individual
architectures can optimize their bitwise locking.
If that does not suffice and their is a REAL problem in the future we
can look to a better approach...
