The thing we want here _is_ weak linkage - "return -ENOSYS unless
you have the real thing".  You can emulate that with ifdefs,
but that's what it is - emulation.  IOW, what we want actually
belongs to linker, not compiler.
When file looks like
#ifdef FOO
<lots of stuff>
<function calling that stuff>
#else
<make that function an equivalent of sys_ni_syscall()>
#endif
we are really talking about "make it an alias of sys_ni_syscall() and let
<all this stuff> override that".
