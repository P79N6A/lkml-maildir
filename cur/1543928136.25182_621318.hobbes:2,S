yes. Is it a regression? If yes, could someone try to bisect it so that 
we can fix it? If it's caused by x86.git then the 'mm' branch of the x86 
git tree can be used for bisection:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git
it's supposed to build and boot fine at every bisection point. The 
bisection run can be cut significantly by narrowing the bisection to the 
arch/x86 changes only:
  git-bisect start arch/x86 include/asm-x86/
(and if it finds a nonsensical commit, i.e. the breakage is not caused 
by the x86 commits, save the "git-bisect log" output into a file, 
restart the git bisection and use "git-bisect replay" to insert all the 
test points into a fuller bisection run - this saves quite some time.)
