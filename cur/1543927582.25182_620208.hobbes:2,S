Good idea.

Right. I'll fix that.

Yes, my gizmo has three channels, but they're all identical with
respect to the basic memcpy() functionality. I suppose we could add a
module parameter to specify the bus_id of the channel to be tested.
Another nice feature would be to start multiple threads exercising
several channels in parallel. In its current form, this module probably
won't find many hard-to-debug race conditions...

The whole switch() block runs with test->lock held.

Yes, probably. Maybe we should even handle suspend/resume as well...

No, it will keep going until the channel is removed. It will prepare to
wait, check if it's already got a channel and if so, break out
immediately and run a test. Otherwise, it will call schedule() and wait
for the event callback to wake it up.

The idea is that when someone attempts to remove a channel in the
middle of a test, the extra dma_chan_get() will make sure that the
channel isn't actually removed until the test is done. The event
callback will set test->chan to NULL, thus putting the thread to sleep
the next time around. It will also ACK the removal, causing the
reference count to drop so that when the currently running test is done
and dma_chan_put() is called, the channel will be released.
I guess we could NAK the removal, but that means we need some way to
signal the thread that it needs to call dma_chan_put() at some point. I
think the current code is nice and symmetric since adding and removing
channels is handled in mostly the same way.
