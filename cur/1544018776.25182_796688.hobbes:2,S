Yep, which is what we do not want. Aliases are "aliases", and not
"module names". We need to add a matching alias to the module then.
Direct module names can not properly defined/blacklisted in userspace,
and we would need to work around that.
Every modalias should be
"<subsystem>:<whatever-name-fits-for-the-subsystem>" to plug properly
into the autoloading infrastructure. We rather have no modalias at
all, then a kernel module name there.
Thanks,
