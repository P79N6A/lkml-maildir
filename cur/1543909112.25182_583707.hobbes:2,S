cmpxchg64_local on 32 bits architectures takes unsigned long long
parameters, but cmpxchg_local only takes longs. Since we have cmpxchg8b
to execute a 8 byte cmpxchg atomically on pentium and +, it makes sense
to provide a flavor of cmpxchg and cmpxchg_local using this instruction.
Also, for 32 bits architectures lacking the 64 bits atomic cmpxchg, it
makes sense _not_ to define cmpxchg64 while cmpxchg could still be
available.
Moreover, the fallback for cmpxchg8b on i386 for 386 and 486 is a
different case than cmpxchg (which is only required for 386). Using
different code makes this easier.
However, cmpxchg64_local will be emulated by disabling interrupts on all
architectures where it is not supported atomically.
Therefore, we *could* turn cmpxchg64_local into a cmpxchg_local, but it
would make the 386/486 fallbacks ugly, make its design different from
cmpxchg/cmpxchg64 (which really depends on atomic operations and cannot
be emulated) and require the __cmpxchg_local to be expressed as a macro
rather than an inline function so the parameters would not be fixed to
unsigned long long in every case.
So I think cmpxchg64_local makes sense there, but I am open to
suggestions.
