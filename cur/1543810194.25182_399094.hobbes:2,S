If your code will have similar relevence than the code from Matthias, you are 
obviously true.

I do use autoconf in the only senseful way.
And if you did have a look at the schily makefile system you would know that
it provides protability to more plaforms than you get from using an GNU
autoconf the way the GNU people tell you.
If you like best portability, you need to use my version of autoconf inside the
schily makefile system and you need to use my smake instead of GNU make.
So my conclusion is that you did not understand portability. All my software is 
using layered portability and if you did take a closer look at the few FSF people 
who know what they are talking about, you would find that e.g. Paul Eggert 
recently started to silently imitate my portability methods.....

???? There are many problems with portability.
One problem is that GNU make is not working in a useful way on many patforms
that are listed to be working. GNU make is unmaintained since many years and
a serious bug I reported in 1999 still has not been fixed.
So for portability, I was forced to make my smake more portable than any other
open source make program. The automake features (don't confuse this with the
ill designed and wrongly named "automake" program from the FSF) of smake
allow to compile my software on nearly any unknown platform.

Well what I did first was to try to have a discussion with the Linux people in 
order to avoid the problems introduced by Linux.
When it turned out that the related people are not interested, all I could do
was to print warnings.

Any system that is worse than another one is deprecated.
If people on LKML believe it is OK not to abide promises and if they don't have 
the vision that /dev/hd* only serves some limited applications but not the need
of generic applications like libscg, this is a LKML problem.

The SCSI glue layer on Solaris is less than 50 kB. I did mention more than once 
that a uniquely layered system could save a lot of code by avoiding to 
implement things more than once.

Well, on such a system, a /dev/hd driver is not needed for the CD-ROM.
A SCSI disk driver would be sufficient.

Most other OS provide this information.
Is Linux really that underdeveloped for not being able to provide DMA residual 
counts?
