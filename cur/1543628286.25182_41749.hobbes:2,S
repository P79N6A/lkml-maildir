A discussion on _Linus_ licensing would be interesting ;-)
To be pedantic, though, I point out that the BK doc at the center of
this flamewar is GPL'd.

hmmm hmmm.
My alternative suggestion, which only applies to development series
kernels, is to spit out pre-patches and releases more frequently.
The releases would be your formal testing points by users, and the
pre-patches would be the sync points for developers, and test points
for developers.  i.e. make the current system work as intended ;-)
Maybe write a script for Linus that automates his side of pre-patch
publishing (if it isn't 100% automatic now)?  i.e. my guess is that
pre-patching is currently automated maybe 70% or so...  This automation
I describe increments the pre-patch number in the makefile, checks
that update into BK, rolls a patch, scp's it to master, and posts the
changelog to linux-kernel.  I could roll a demo script that does this,
if people think this is a sane alternative.
IOW, I propose to create a "linuspush" script that replaces his current
"bk push" command.  Linus pushes batches of csets out at a time,
make these cset batches the pre-patches...
	Jeff, who wouldn't mind snapshots either
