	Hi,
	You know the story : another set of IrDA patches are ready to
be incorporated in the Linux kernel. One one hand, minor cleanups of
the stack, one the other hand nasty bugs in IrLPT and IrLAN (that
could crash your kernel).
	Patches are mostly obvious and have been tested on 2.4.18-pre2
and 2.5.2-pre10 (because I still want to keep 2.4.X and 2.5.X in
sync). Some patches will apply to 2.5.X with harmless line
differences. The last patch, ir248_config-3.diff is only to sync 2.4.X
with 2.5.X (Marcelo missed one bit).
        Have fun...
        Jean
