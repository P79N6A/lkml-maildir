Out of curiosity do you have a list of such syscalls?
"usually" is the problem - you cannot be sure what syscalls unknown applications are using.

I assumed David was talking about having every different feature as a config 
option.

The possibility is that there might be unknown applications which use these "obsolete" system
calls. 
Vendors who want to support older applications (most distributions) will have to enable all 
these option(s), while users who do not need one or a few of them can disable accordingly 
("specialized" applications).
One thing is that ordinary users are not supposed to know what system calls his applications
are going to use, most of these users will be running vendor shipped kernels anyway.
I personally dont like the idea of disabling "obsolete" system calls with config options, 
but it is useful for specialized applications to save memory. 
Are many users going to benefit from it?
