if you need to flush just one address, the prio-tree may give you an
huge boost, overall flush_dcache_page should become pretty quick in most
situations.

What you miss is that the problem is not in flush_dcache_page, the
problem is that the _other_ users of the prio-tree may take as long as a
timeslice. So it's the _other_ user that you've no control about (i.e.
truncate) that may take timeslices with irq disabled.
But I've an fairly optimal solution for you, you should make it a
read_write spinlock, with the readers not disabling interrupts, and the
writer disabling interrupts, the writer of the prio-tree will not take a
timeslice, the readers instead will take a timeslice, but since they're
readers and you've only to read in the flush_dcache_page irq context,
you don't need to disable irqs for the readers.  I don't have better
solutions than this one at the moment (yeah there's the rcu reading of
the prio-tree but I'd leave it for later...)
