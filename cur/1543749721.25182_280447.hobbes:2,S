Hi Selva,
 I understood the question as where all/what all printks (with
 line nos and the file names)
 you are looking for is it. I think, in a normal printf  using the
 macros __FILE__ and __LINE__ will give that...
 ex:
 printk(KERN_ERR "%s: Driver Initialisation failed", __FILE__);
 Is this helpful...
Regards,
srinivas.
