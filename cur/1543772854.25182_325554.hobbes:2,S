Well my ignorance is going to show here.  The platform initialization code
has already run and PCI probing happens later.  How do you reconcile Venki's
concern for an HPET armed for legacy support when platform
is already using PIT?  Also the hpet driver isn't a PCI driver but 
ACPI driver.  It's working for you so I'm obviously missing a detail.
