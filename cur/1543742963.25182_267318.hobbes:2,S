Subject: [PATCH 2.6.10-rc1] Fix CPM2 uart driver device number brain damage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/1/242

The following patch against 2.6.10-rc1 fixes the brain damage that was
found in the CPM2 uart driver.  Previously, if 8250 was configured in,
it would use one set of numbers (which at the time didn't conflict with
anything, but have since been officially given to the Motorola i.MX
driver) and if 8250 wasn't in, it would masquerade as it.  The following
switches us over to 204/46...49 (Which is still unclaimed).  I don't
know whose tree this should go in, however..
