Unfortunately, to deal with this issue would mean breaking off from
planned work, so I'm not going to be in a position to do an element
by element comparison of the structures for some time.
Maybe I can look at it after the weekend though.
However, I think if you just compare:
linux/include/linux/irq.h
linux/include/asm-arm/mach/irq.h
you'll realise how inadequate the "generic" IRQ code is for ARM.
Note that IRQ handling on ARM is a multi-level affair where we have
multiple levels of interrupt controllers which need to be traversed
in software.
