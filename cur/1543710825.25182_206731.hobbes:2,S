[PATCH] I2C: fix i2c adapters class for now
Please accept this temporary fix for the class issue. I'd like users of
the i2c-ali1535, i2c-sis5595 and i2c-via driver to be able to use
sensors as soon as possible, even if we have not yet determined what our
policy WRT classes should be.
Thanks.
BTW, don't you think I2C_ADAP_CLASS_SMBUS is a misnomer? It's about
hardware monitoring, not the SMBus protocol. I'd say
I2C_ADAP_CLASS_HWMON or I2C_ADAP_CLASS_SENSORS would have been more
appropriate (although it may be a bit late for a change...)
