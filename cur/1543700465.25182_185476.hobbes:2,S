Not sure what else to tell you. If the pdcraid driver is compiled into the
kernel, you'll get a message about it during boot, even if it can't find all the
drives. I no longer use the 2.4 kernel series (or pdcraid), so I'm afraid I'm
out of ideas. Maybe somebody else on the list has some other things to try. Sorry.
