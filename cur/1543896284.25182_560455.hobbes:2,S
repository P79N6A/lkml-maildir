I believe compilation copyrights do bear on GPL-licensed software, by
virtue of the GPL's sentence "[...] rather, the intent is to exercise
the right to control the distribution of derivative _or collective_
works based on the Program." (emphasis added).
There is a lot of grey and/or arguable area about what constitutes a
GPL-encumbered collective work versus mere aggregation.  Although I
disagree, I understand and respect that some believe that the kernel
plus a digital signature over it is "mere aggregation".  I would like
to focus the discussion on that question, though, rather than whether
the GPL is worded to control the rights to compilations-in-general
that include GPLed works.
