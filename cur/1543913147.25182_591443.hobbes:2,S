Or, better yet, as suggested by Rusty:
6.	Use random32() from lib/random32.c and be happy.  This does
	disable preemption across the calculation, which should not
	be a problem in most situations.  Although it does not protect
	against interrupts, the effect would simply be to scramble
	the state a bit more (or perhaps unscramble it a bit).
	The overhead should not be too bad.
There.  My work is done.  ;-)
