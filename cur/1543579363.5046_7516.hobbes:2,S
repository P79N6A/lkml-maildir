There is no ordering of interrupts with respect to transactions in PCI.
As a result, getting interrupts that does not match a pending interrupt
condition as seen by driver can happen, without the interrupt being
spurious.
As a result, the 2 following assertions:
- All interrupts in PCI are spurious
- No interrupt is PCI is spurious
Are less wrong than asserting that some interrupts in PCI are relevant and
some are spurious. :-)
And btw, some hardwares, notably Intel ones, seems to ensure coherency
prior to deliver interrupts. This is a useless work when the IRQ is
actually shared and does only make sense for ISA or ISA-like PCI devices
and in situations where the IRQ is not actually shared.

In theory, the O/S should warn _loudly_ if any PCI device hasn't a
software driver attached, for the reason there is no generic way to
actually quiesce completely a PCI device. As a result, loading drivers
after boot or just loading drivers with interrupt enabled at boot is
unsafe with PCI devices. This shall be considered, even if the risk of a
breakage is generally very low.
