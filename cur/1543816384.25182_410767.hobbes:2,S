Well, to a large extent he's actually wisely kind of stayed out of  
the flamewars :-D  I'm guessing he's hoping that we'll figure  
something acceptable out on our own and send him patches without him  
having to think about it much.  He has said this, though:

My hope for this is that we can start doing _little_ and clearly  
obvious changes that clean up header files.  Basically a lot of the  
__KERNEL__ definitions need janitorial work.  Either they need to be  
removed or they need to be put in the right places.  Also it seems  
like there's a lot of duplication between architectures; for one  
example look at all the varieties of FD_SET code in the different  
linux/include/asm-*/posix_types.h files.  That's one of the areas I'm  
trying to clean up into a single linux/fdset.h included from the  
pertinent files.  Notice how the file forcibly overrides GLIBC; I  
think if we can define it as __KABI_FD* and only define the non- 
prefixed version in __KERNEL__, then we can provide something that  
GLIBC and klibc can get for free, without having to figure out their  
own bitmaps.  Likewise some of the user-accessible types are uniform  
across architectures, and others are haphazardly arrayed, some to be  
compatible with other OSes on that architecture, others just because  
that's what the arch they copied from used.  I'm hoping if I can get  
enough small patches flowing, others will join in too and the process  
will go easier.
