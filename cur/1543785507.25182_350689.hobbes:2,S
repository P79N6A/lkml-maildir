The benchmarks surely says something about the kernel regardless of
wether they specify hardware.  But if you want performance regressions
fixed, then the hardware list is necessary.  It is interesting to know
wether the test machine used SCSI or IDE for IO for example, for those
systems get different patches.  One may regress while another improves.
Similiar for all the different network adapter drivers and so on.
