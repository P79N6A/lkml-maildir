Subject: [PATCH] Boot Logo configuration and generation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've replaced my former attempt at a patch with The Real Thing this
time... including the patches to include/linux/console.h and
kernel/printk.c that should have been in there last time.
BRIEFLY:
---------
This patch comes with a "make_bootlogo.pl" script for installing your
own custom boot graphics and adds two options to the frame buffer kernel
configuration:
    CONFIG_QUIET_PRINTK: suppresses printk()'s console output
and
    CONFIG_FBLOGO_{TOPLEFT,CENTER}: chooses screen position for the boot
graphic
The patch is at:
    
http://execpc.com/~rdmiller/Linux/kernel-bootlogo.patch.gz
and is roughly 120k bytes due to the movement of the raw logo data.
DETAILS:
--------
Documentation for the kernel configuration options has been added to the
Documentation/Configure.help file.  There is also a
Documentation/fb/make_bootlogo.txt to explain the use of the new script
for installing your own graphic.
Previous graphics have been retained, but moved to linux_logo_data.h
files where applicable.  The non-architecture-specific default logo is
in include/linux/linux_logo_default.h which gets linked to
include/linux/linux_logo.h if there isn't an architecture-specific logo.
ONE FINAL CAUTION:
------------------
Choose your boot logo with some measure of prudence.  A certain non-ANSI
logo suggested recently on this mailing list would probably not be
appropriate.
