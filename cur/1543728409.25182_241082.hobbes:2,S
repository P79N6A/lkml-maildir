I am trying to get it patched against rc4-mm1, but it seems there
are some issues with the SMT bits - dependent_sleeper for example
is still around although it was removed with all previous patches
(and uses task_t.time_slice which is no longer there).
I assume you forgot to apply them?  Possible to get a complete
patch?  If not, I'll see if I can get something going after some
sleep.
Thanks,
