Oh, you're right, now I understand your motivation in doing this.
Then perhaps using your trick but applying it to the whole for loop
would make it easier to read ?
#define for_each_cpu_mask(cpu, mask)			\
	for ((cpu) = 0; (cpu) < NR_CPUS; (cpu)++) 	\
	    ({	unsigned long __bits = (mask).bits[0] >> (cpu); \
		if (!__bits)				\
			break;				\
		if (!__bits & 1)			\
			continue;			\
		else					\
                ...					\
            })
Please note that I've not read the rest of the code, so there
may be some problems left. However, if the above works, I find
it easier to read. And in this case, yes, it's interesting to
be able to break from within an expression.
Cheers,
Willy
