No. To satisfy the standard, it would be necessary to let the seek succeed and
to return the already unlinked dentry or the next dentry (this is
unspecified). I think we should return the next dentry, therefore I let the
seek fail (seekdir() doesn't even have a return value) and the cursor/f_pos is
still at the old offset.
The real problem is this IMHO:
...
telldir() = a
...
telldir() = b
readdir() = foo.txt
unlink(foo.txt)
seekdir(a)
seekdir(b)
readdir() = ???
With my patch the seekdir(b) doesn't find the offset and is placing the cursor
at the end of the directory. In my understanding of the SuSV3 this should be
possible and should return either "foo.txt" or the next entry after
"foo.txt". I don't see any chance how I can implement that.
