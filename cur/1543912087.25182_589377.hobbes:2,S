actually, now that i look more closely at the code browser at
lxr.linux.no, "ether=" has been listed as "obsolete" since *at least*
2.6.10.  not to sound unsympathetic but anyone who tries to jump from
2.6.10 to 2.6.24 in one step deserves what they get.  :-)
ok, that was cruel, but you see my point, right?
