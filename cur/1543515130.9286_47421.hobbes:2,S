Subject: PPP 2.3.10 and kernel 2.2.13 problem?

Paul,
from the README of PPP 2.3.10 I understand that you do the fine work 
for the Linux version of pppd -- which I really love (but I guess I 
don't have to tell you that because otherwise I would not be using 
it).
I use PPP to dial into an NT server with call back. Unfortunately, now 
I get the following when activating debug mode -- which I cannot 
correctly interpret:
Serial connection established.
Using interface ppp0
Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/modem

Could you give me a hint on what is going wrong and how I might fix 
it?
Thanks,
Parto.
