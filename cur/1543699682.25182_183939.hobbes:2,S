Yes, of course. That's what you use the hacked-up non-macro-expanding-or-
#if-processing preprocessor for. :)

Hm, OK, so a hacked cpp isn't good enough because it still requires more
than grep over preprocessed-save-for-#if-and-macro-expansion sources to
determine if you'll get an external symbol reference.
(Hm, or does it? We'll get FPs doing it that way, from text in literal
strings, but how many? How many modules contain the names of exported
symbols from other modules in literal strings? Not many, I guess, but
there's no way to tell but to try... I'll have a whack at it.)
