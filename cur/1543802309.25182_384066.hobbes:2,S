Note that in the case where the _latest_ state of the tre you are tracking 
really matters, then doing a "git pull" is absolutely and unquestionably 
the right thing to do. 
So if people thought that I don't want to have sub-maintainers pulling 
from my tree _at_all_, then that was a mis-communication. I don't in any 
way require a linear history, and criss-cross merges are supported 
perfectly well by git, and even encouraged in those situations.
After all, if tree B starts using features that are new to tree A, then 
the merge from A->B is required for functionality, and the synchronization 
is a fundamental part of the history of development. In that cases, the 
history complexity of the resulting tree is a result of real development 
complexity.
Now, obviously, for various reasons we want to avoid having those kinds of 
linkages as much as possible. We like to have develpment of different 
subsystems as independent as possible, not because it makes for a "more 
readable history", but because it makes it a lot easier to debug - if we 
have three independent features/development trees, they can be debugged 
independently too, while any linkages inevitably also mean that any bugs 
end up being interlinked..
