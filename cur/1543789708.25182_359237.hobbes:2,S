Maybe not, with lots of small files.  All the metadata associated with
those files (directory blocks, inode blocks, allocation maps, etc) is
cached in the blockdev pagecache (aka buffer cache).

The document is optimistic ;)

I wouldn't expect later kernels would change this a lot.

It could be a JFS quirk - I don't know much about JFS.  It'd be interesting
to know if other filesystems behave in a similar manner.

I'd have expected more dentry_cache.

One thing you could do is to (re)mount the filesystems with `-o noatime'.
When userspace reads a file the kernel will update the atime.  This
involves dirtying the in-core inode and later writing it to an on-disk
inode.  That write requires that the on-disk inode's block be in blockdev
pagecache.
With `-o noatime', the kernel will no longer need to write the inode atimes
and will satisfy all inode read requests from the separate inode cache. 
Hence the blockdev pagecache page which backs the inode will remain
untouched and will be reclaimed.
That should release _some_ of the blockdev pagecache, but not a lot, I
expect.  Maybe JFS is just metadata-intensive..
