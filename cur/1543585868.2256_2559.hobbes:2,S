Get real.  If you buy (cheapest) 40GB IDE disks, I can have 2TB for
U$9200 (not including controllers).  In 1 year it will be half, etc.
I expect I will start moving my DVD collection to disk storage in an
ia32 system once price/GB falls by 50% from current levels.  This is
just for home use, let alone what large companies want to do.  I am
fully expecting hard drive price/GB to keep falling at its current rate.
This whole "64-bit" fallacy has got to stop.  First it was "anybody
who needs files > 2GB should use a 64-bit CPU", wrong.  Then it was
"anybody who needs > 1GB RAM should use a 64-bit CPU", wrong.  Now it is
"anybody who needs > 2TB disk should use a 64-bit CPU", soon to be wrong.
I don't think the millions of 32-bit systems will disappear overnight,
or even in 10 years, yet we already have single IDE disks > 100GB, and
in 2 or 3 years we will have single IDE disks > 1TB that people will
want to use in their 32-bit systems.
Cheers, Andreas
