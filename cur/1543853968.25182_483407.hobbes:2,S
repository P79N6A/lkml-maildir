Andrew Morton sorry I missed your reply:
To recap, I said:
     FYI, I had to get CONFIG_SYSCTL_SYSCALL set to solve my
2.6.19-rc1 boot panic.
     Actually, I couldn't get CONFIG_SYSCTL_SYSCALL=y to stick so I
modified kernel/sysctl.c's ifdefs.
You said:
    What boot panic was that?
    It depends on CONFIG_EMBEDDED.
The panic was because init died. I get an error message about unknown
library version (exact message I can't recall) and then the panic.
Again, I am running a new 2.6.x kernel on an old distribution so my
init binary or run-time loader might still be depending on SYSCTL.
I am now playing with a x86_64 kernel and saw this same problem. Your
CONFIG_EMBEDDED hint helped. I set that and CONFIG_SYSCTL_SYSCALL
stays on.
Thanks again and sorry for not attaching this to the original email thread.
