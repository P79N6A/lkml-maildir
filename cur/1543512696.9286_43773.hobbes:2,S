	Ok...  Figured out (I think) what the problem was.  I rebuilt
the kernel with CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS support enabled and CONFIG_DEVPTS_FS
enabled and now the serial mouse works.  Neither the 2.2.12 or 2.3.21
kernel had those enabled in my earlier builds, but the serial mouse worked
in 2.2.12 and didn't work in 2.3.21.  I now have both of those options
enabled in both of those versions of the kernel and the serial mouse
is working fine in both.
	Anyone have a clue as to why or was this just some wild coincidence
and I had a bad build earlier???
	Mike
