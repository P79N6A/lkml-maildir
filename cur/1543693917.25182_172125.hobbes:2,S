free_pages as said if it's buggy, then it can still trigger no matter
whatever you do there, at that deep point of free_pages a alloc_page
user will be able to get the page and corrupt it anyways, so it can't
help and it will never be able to help no matter what xfs or whatever
else gets merged. If that makes a difference alloc_page users will still
break it.
we can argue about the filemap.c part, but I'm sure the page_alloc.c part
can't make any sense ever.
