Ok.  Looking at it I almost certain the problem is that
we lost the hunk of code removed in: 266f0566761cf88906d634727b3d9fc2556f5cbd
i386: Fix stack switching in do_IRQ
-       if (!irq_desc[irq].handle_irq) {
-               __do_IRQ(irq, regs);
-               goto out_exit;
-       }
The msi code does not yet set desc->handle_irq.  So when we attempt
to call it we get a NULL pointer dereference.
Except for adding that hunk back in and breaking 4K stacks I don't
have an immediate fix.
I do have a pending cleanup that should result in us setting handle_irq
in all cases.  I will see if I can advance that shortly.
Eric
