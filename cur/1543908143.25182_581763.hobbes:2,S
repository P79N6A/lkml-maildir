Losing the volatile from the "set" variants definitely changes
the code generated.  Before the patch gcc would give us:
	st4.rel [r37]=r9
after
	st4 [r37]=r9
It is unclear whether anyone relies on (or even whether they should
rely on) the release semantics that are provided by the current
version of atomic.h.  But making this change would require an
audit of all the uses of atomic_set() to find an answer.
There is a more worrying difference in the generated code (this
from the ancient and venerable gcc 3.4.6 that is on my build
machine).   In rwsem_down_failed_common I see this change (after
disassembling vmlinux, I used sed to zap the low 32-bits of addresses
to make the diff manageable ... that's why the addresses all end
in xxxxxxxx):

This code is probably from the rwsem_atomic_update(adjustment, sem) macro
which is cpp'd to atomic64_add_return().  It looks really bad that the new
code reads a 32-bit value and sign extends it rather than reading a 64-bit
value (but I'm perplexed as to why this patch provoked this change in the
generated code).
