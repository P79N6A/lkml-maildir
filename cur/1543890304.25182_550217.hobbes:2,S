Yes, I should have considered that the earlier #2/3 needs
coordination between you and Jeff.

Thanks for the hint.  Alan is correct to point out that I
cheated. ;-)  If I understand correctly, the change would
involve:
 - create a new file that has ata_device_blacklist[] whose type
   is "struct ata_blacklist_entry" (i.e. matches libata-core),
   by separating the table out of ata/libata-core.c.
   Q1. should that file go to drivers/ata/ or drivers/ide/?
 - make that file depended on when either libata and/or IDE is
   selected.
   Q2. Kconfig dependency rule is needed for this, perhaps.  How
   should that look like?
 - some out-of-tree drivers might be using ide_in_drive_list()
   and relying on it to take "struct drive_list_entry"; create a
   new function, ide_in_device_list(), that takes "struct
   ata_blacklist_entry" as its parameter.
   Q3. Is the 'out-of-tree drivers' a real issue, and if so, is
   the above a reasonable avenue to take?
 - convert in-tree callers to use ide_in_device_list() instead,
   feeding it ata_device_blacklist[], and remove drive_blacklist[]
   from drivers/ide/ide-dma.c.
   Q4. What would you like to do for drive_whitelist[]?
> Care to respin both patches?
Before the questions are answered I cannot respin the earlier
#2/3, but I can certainly respin #3/3.
