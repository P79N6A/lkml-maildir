this one is broken.  You kall kmem_cache_alloc and kmem_cache_free
under a spinlock which is not wrong (at least with GFP_ATOMIC) but useless.
You don't have a mempool so you will deadlock under load.
You have a kmem_cache_t per host which is unessecary, one in the driver is
enough.

Would be nice to unpack into a directory instead of CWD, like almost any
tarball does..

So it won't get merged into 2.6.x.  Not that it would be likely given your
complete ignorance of the other TODO items.  Sometimes I really wish to
get some funding to work on a mergeable qla2xxx driver as it seems impossible
to get one from qlogic..
