Alan,
  As for 'rep nop', couldn't we add in the code, as an example:  
#ifdef Pentium_4
rep nop
#endif
  As for the 2.2.18 patch for correctly determining 2GHz and above, can
it be easily  merged into the 2.4.x kernel, and if so, what's the maximum
clock speed that can be detected?
Regards,
-Frank
