I said an _additional_ bit.  I am assuming that N-1 reads returned the
same, (bad), data, which was identified as bad.  Read N encountered
one too many flipped bits and returned a false positive.  Perfectly
possible, and arguably more likely than all of the existing incorrect
bits flipping back, resulting in the correct data being read back, in
some cases.

Hardly.  The point I was trying to make is that the likelyhood of a
critical fault is greater when you are experiencing many non-critical
faults.

Tell this to the drive manufacturers.  They are the ones who can sell

Your argument is flawed - how can you claim the current situation is
sane when at least some drive manufactuers don't publish simple facts
such as what happens when defective blocks are encountered on reads
and on writes?

If a system got in to a state as extreme as that, I'd generally take
the hole system down.  Electromagnatic interference that affects one
drive immediately noticably may well be affecting other components in
subtle ways - possible _silent_ data corruption in other words.

Yes.  Or more specifically, I wouldn't trust that data without
verifying it.  It's easy to ignore such problems and say that
everything is probably OK, and maybe 99% of the time you would be
right, but so what?  What about that 1%?

Not sure what you mean - in what context?

Data recovery is always a last resort.  On the other hand, backing up
data daily can still result in 23 hours of lost data, so I consider
early detection of faulty disks very important.  Mirroring brings it's
own problems to consider - more devices to possibly fail, and if they
are connected to the same controller, a serious fault with any one
could usually theoretically destroy all of them.
