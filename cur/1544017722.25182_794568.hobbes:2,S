These patches probably belong in linux-fsdevel, but I hesitate to ask
you to repost all twenty.

ext[234] return a portion of the uuid in f_fsid.  There is a theoretical
chance of those values being non-unique.  Since there doesn't appear to
be any case for the fsid to be persistent between boots, I guess
huge_encode_dev() is probably a better choice.  In practice it probably
makes no difference.

They look reasonable to me.
