 For what it is worth - rc7 compiles and boots here
(HP/DL380G4,2x86_64, 8GB, cciss, 2xtg3). The subjective feeling(*) is
much better that the original RHEL4 kernel and better than 2.6.19 on
the same box.
(*) Our main problem with 2.6 kernels so far is a tendency to really
bad responsiveness under I/O related load.
Cheers
Martin
