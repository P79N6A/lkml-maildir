Wouldn't it be better to kmalloc both struct dvb_device and
struct file_operations together instead of doing 2 separate allocations?
struct dvd_device_plus_fops
{
  struct dvb_device dev;
  struct file_operations fops;
} *dev_fops = kmalloc (sizeof (struct dvd_device_plus_fops), GFP_KERNEL);
*pdvbdev = dvbdev = (struct dvb_device *)dev_fops;
if (dev_fops == NULL)
  error handling;
memset (&dev_fops->fops, 0, sizeof (dev_fops->fops));
...
dvbdev->fops = &dev_fops->fops;
