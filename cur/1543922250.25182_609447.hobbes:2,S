Since we already have the Instrumentation menu in
kernel/Kconfig.instrumentation and instrumentation code all over the
kernel tree:
arch/*/oprofile/*.c
kernel/kprobes.c
arch/*/kernel/kprobes.c
kernel/marker.c
kernel/profile.c
kernel/profile.S
kernel/lockdep.c
vm/vmstat.c
block/blktrace.c
We could move them to 
instrumentation/
arch/*/instrumentation/
Therefore, we could also move the kprobes and marker samples under
instrumentation/samples/
My main concern is that 15 characters long directory name might be
inelegant (however, it only beats Documentation by 2).
