[1.] One line summary of the problem: 
Kernel don't run at boot time
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
I've an oops message and the system is Halted, no syslog report,
a screen I think just after two lines
parport0
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
kernel
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Sorry but This kernel halt completly on my system !
It's a version 2.2.14 
Idem with 2.2.15pre-5
2.2.13 running fine
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information 
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
At boot, just after the two lines beginning by parport 0 :
--------------------------------------------------------------
unable to handle kernel NULL POINTER REFERENCE AT VIRTUAL ADRESS 00000000
current -> tss.cr3 = 00101000, %cr3 = 00101000
*pde = 00000000
CPU : 0

I think it would be correct, I write that at the hand because after the system
is halted
 [6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)[
Sorry I'm not programmer !

[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
Since a few Kernel releases :
My clock never stay at good time, at each reboot
and  sometime when running I've a clock skew  problem, nothing like  under
Windows. I think this could come from Kernel (Or buggy bios ? ASUS P2B card )
because even in single user mode I've the problem. 
Sometime I've a " Ext2fs warning, inode already cleared" when typing rm -rf for
a big directory (Linux kernel sources ! ). Any idea about that ?
 
Sorry but can't help u anymore, I'm not programmer.
