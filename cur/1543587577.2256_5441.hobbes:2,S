hdparm /dev/hda 
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 59556/16/63, sectors = 60032448, start = 0
the same on /dev/hdc
I played with different hdparm-settings, but it's not possible to speed up 
the HDs
