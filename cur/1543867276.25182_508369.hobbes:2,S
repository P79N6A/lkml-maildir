Sure, I knew it from the very beginning ;)

Thanks, I now understand that you either don't see the difference
between "indeterminate" and "implementation-defined" in this context or
consider it non-essential, so I think I've got your point.

Sure.

Didn't I further explain what I meant exactly (that you've skipped)?
OK, never mind.

OK, no problem.

So just don't pass it "unsigned char*". End of story.

I never had problems either with strlen() or with this warning, so was
curious why does the warning is such a problem for the kernel. I'm sorry
I took your time and haven't got an answer that I entirely agree
with. Thank you very much for your explanations anyway.

Amen!
