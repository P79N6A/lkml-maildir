If another compiler wants to compile the kernel, it must have
implemented various widely used gcc extensions.

The "register" keyword is and was always from start *at most* a hint to
the C compiler to use a register for that variable (similar to "inline"
BTW).
So every C compiler is allowed to simply ignore the "register" for any
reason - be it "not implemented" or "the compiler knows better".
Trivial reason: Think of a function with 100 register variables.
