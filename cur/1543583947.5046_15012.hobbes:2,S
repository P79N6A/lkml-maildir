OK.  The ZIP drive can not handle uDMA, so it's normal for the secondary 
controller to drop back.  In my opinion, the primary controller should stay 
at uDMA speed, but it is PC hardware so it is perfectly possible there is 
something cheap that locks them together.  I will bring up ac-12 and check 
the error message...
