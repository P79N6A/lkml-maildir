Actually, this is bullshit.  If you go back and look what Linus
actually said, it was:
- One namespace only.  If you're going to a new namespace, then that's
  going to be it.  You're not going to put two namespaces in the
  kernel.
- If you're going hierarcial, do it right, not the Sun-like halfassed
  thing.
