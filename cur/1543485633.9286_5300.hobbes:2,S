The 2.2.1 kernels don't boot on some prep/chrp boxes (like my Motorola NET
4000/200 for instance).  I think the ppc developers are going to be going over
the whole boot process in a bit.  You might try the diffs at:
	
ftp://ftp.linuxppc.org/gary/diffs-2.2.0p7-Jan20
Note, drivers/char/pc_keyb.c won't apply, and you'll need to apply the changes
by hand (or not apply them if you don't care about the mouse port).  You might
want to subscribe to the linuxppc development mailing list
(linuxppc-dev@lists.linuxppc.org is the mailing list, and
linuxppc-dev-request@lists.linuxppc.org is to subscribe/unsubscribe).
As I recall, there are some differences from the 601 to the other PowerPC's,
but I think Linux may be aware of them.
