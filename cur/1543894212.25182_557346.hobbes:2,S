Do you need anything else?
But if by the question you mean "would you think the GPLv3 is fine without 
the new language in section 6 about the 'consumer devices'", then the 
answer is that yes, I think that the current GPLv3 draft looks fine apart 
from that.

I've *not* failed to elaborate on that before. Not at all. 
Just google for
	torvalds tit-for-tat
and you'll see a lot of my previous postings. Trying to claim that this is 
somehow "new" is ludicrous. In fact, some of the google hits you find are 
from 2004, *loong* before the current GPLv3 discussion.
So your "failed to elaborate" is not a failure on my side. 
Giving back "in kind" is obvious. I give you source code to do with as you 
see fit. I just expect you to give back in kind: source code for me to do 
with as I see fit, under the same license I gave you source code.
How hard is that to accept?
I don't ask for money. I don't ask for sexual favors. I don't ask for 
access to the hardware you design and sell. I just ask for the thing I 
gave you: source code that I can use myself.
I really don't think my "tit-for-tat" or "give back in kind" is that hard 
to understand, is it?
And no, it's not a new concept. Neither is the fact that I've never agreed 
with the FSF's agenda about "freedom" (as defined by _them_ - I have a 
notion of "freedom" myself, and the FSF doesn't get to define it for me).
I don't call Linux "Free Software". I haven't called it that for close to 
ten years! Because I think the term "Open Source" is a lot better.

I respect your freedom to design products around Linux. You can do 
whatever you damn well please - I just ask that you give the software back 
in a usable form. That's all I ask for.
And that's all the GPLv2 asks for. 
Which is why I selected the GPLv2 in the first place, and why I *still* 
think the GPLv2 is a wonderful license!
So I claim that the "freedoms" that the GPLv2 embodies are *greater* than 
the "freedoms" embodied in the GPLv3.
