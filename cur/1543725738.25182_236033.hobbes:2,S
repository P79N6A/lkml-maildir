The kernel snprintf() is (and the shown warning is actually debatable.
Actually snprintf()s interface is not that optimal for easy handling,
since the size parameter is unsigned and not signed. But it is specified
in SUSv3 that way.).

Since "overflows" only occur if the destination buffer is full, one
could avoid the following snppritnf()s completely. Let alone the call of
strlen()
----  snip  ----
   len = snprintf(buffer, PAGE_SIZE, "From: %s\n", object);
   if (len < PAGE_SIZE) {
      len += snprintf(buffer+len, PAGE_SIZE - len,
                      "Signal: %s\n", signal);
   }
----  snip  ----
