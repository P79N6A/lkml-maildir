Hello,
I want to solicit your attention in receiving funds on my 
behalf.
The purpose of my contacting you is because you live in a 
Western country with a stable economy where one can invest.
On 
receipt 
of your response, I will send you full details and more 
information 
about myself and the funds, email me on this ID 
(j_yun47@yahoo.com.hk).
Thank you.
Yun
