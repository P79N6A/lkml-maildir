Hello
Since (I guess) 2.5.58, there have been problems with cursor in Radeon framebuffer console. In the previous versions the cursor was nat visible at all. Now (in 2.5.66) it blinks iregularily and at times it changes shape and color (it seems that something writes in the cursor's image).
Has anyone experienced the same and aren't there any patches ?
Regards
Petr
