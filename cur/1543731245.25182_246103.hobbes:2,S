I can confirm very bad behaviour on my machine running 2.6.9-rc1-mm1
I've noticed curruption of rpm database, (symptom: error: db4 error(-30989) 
from dbcursor->c_get: DB_PAGE_NOTFOUND: Requested page not found )
So I've tried to rebuild the database, failing with the same error.
I've completely wiped out the database direcory, copied another one from a 
similar machine (just for testing). Now under 2.6.7-mm7 all database is read 
just fine, but under 2.6.9-rc1-mm1 i get the same error DB_PAGE_NOTFOUND, so 
I suspect read error.
If I try to tar the archive, I get several errors, i.e.:
tar: /var/lib/rpm/Packages: File shrank by 4096 bytes; padding with zeros
(2.6.9-rc1-mm1)
Filesystem: jfs
system: P IV 1.70 
Attached you can find my config file for 2.6.9-rc1-mm1.
I can make tests if needed.
