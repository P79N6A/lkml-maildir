Subject: 2.2.0-pre4 is slow and pre4-ac1 is broken =(

Hello!
It seems that the memory management in pre4 is pretty slow, I can hardly
do anything in X if I'm burning a cd at the same time. (I can't recall
having that problem with pre3, although I didn't have much time testing
it...). According to my little wmaker app that checks memory and swap
usage it uses swap even if there is lots of real memory left. It is really
sluggish. 
So I thought I should give pre4-ac1 a try (I've always had good luck with
Alans patches). Though this time it seems to be broken on the ip-masq
stuff. I get this message (which kills the compilation):
net/network.a(ipv4.o)(__ksymtab+0x68): undefined reference to
`ip_masq_select_addr'
Hope this helps! If someone wants more info please mail me about it!
