IF you do user-mode programs which need access to linux-specific header
files you should use configure to test, whether the needed feature is in
the glibc linux/* headers, and if not you should use a version distributed
by _your_ software-package! I.e. you do the cp on your self, sort of a
linux_feature_cdrom_dosomeneatstuff_ioctl.h in your source-package.
With compiling kernel modules distributed seperately, one should go the
way MEC suggested some weeks ago (a directory in the kernel source,
where you can drop in the module source and use standard make configure &&
make modules).
Richard.
