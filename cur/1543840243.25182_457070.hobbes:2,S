Hi,
Alright, I know that "mem_write" (fs/proc/base.c) is a "security hazard",
but I need to use it anyway (as super-user only), and find it broken,
somewhere between Linux-2.6.17 and Linux-2.6.18-rc4.
The point is that in the beginning of the routine, "copied" is set to 0,
but it is no good because in lines 805 and 812 it is set to other values.
Finally, the routine returns as if it copied 12 (=ENOMEM) bytes less than
it actually did.
Amnon.
