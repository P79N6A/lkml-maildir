Subject: [PATCH] 2.4-ac: migration_thread locking fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Alan,
Anton Blanchard reported a lock vs. interrupt-off ordering bug in
migration_thread.  The bug is already fixed in 2.5.  A patch is attached
to fix O(1) in your tree.
See the comments above double_rq_lock and double_rq_unlock (which,
sadly, I wrote)!  Without this patch there is a possibility to hang,
which Anton observed.
Patch is against 2.4.19-pre8-ac1, please apply.
