Where can I get more information about the LinuxThread?  Specifically
is it implemented by processes sharing the same address space or by
user-level threads?
Also, do you mean there is NO POSIX threads implementation in Linux at
all?
That does not sound right to me, although I have not checked it out
myself.

If threads are implemented as processes sharing the same address space,
we do need to modify kernel to implement priority inheritance.
