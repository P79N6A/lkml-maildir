I'm not saying it's a good thing.  I'm saying that the 5% performance increase
that results is not something that the average "I just want to use the system"
will even notice, let alone care about.

They don't need to ship a mass of kernels.  Modern distributions probably
don't need to worry about shipping three or four modular kernels.  Any user
who cares about the minor performance benefits of a custom-configured kernel
is going to reconfigure and recompile regardless of how dumbed-down the
interface is.
