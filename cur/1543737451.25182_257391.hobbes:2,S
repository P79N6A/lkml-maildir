Hello list,
Just tried swsusp, works great, besides a few strange things:
- The suspend routine is unable to shutdown the mysqld process:
Oct  4 10:19:43 precious kernel: Stopping tasks: =================================================
Oct  4 10:19:43 precious kernel:  stopping tasks failed (1 tasks remaining)
Oct  4 10:19:43 precious kernel: Restarting tasks...<6> Strange, mysqld not stopped
Oct  4 10:19:43 precious kernel:  done
- USB subsystem is totally unworking until I reinitialise it (using /etc/init.d/hotplug restart)
- modem does not work (uses ALSA module snd_intel8x0m with a 'modem daemon'). Restarting the daemon makes things work.
- ALSA mixer volume is set to 0 for all channels (can be fixed by running /etc/init.d/alsa start at resume)
Otherwise than these small problems it works fine, from within X. Using the radeon driver.
Jan
