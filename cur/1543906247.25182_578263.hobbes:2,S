There seems to be a general need for boosting threads temporarely in a few 
places. HR-timers also have it, last time I checked. And preemptive RCU as 
well for boosting RCU readers. They all seems to deal with the same issues 
of correctly dealing with setting the priority and PI bosting from 
mutexes.
When boosting of RCU readers was discussed I came to the conclusion that 
the boosting property should be taken out of the of the rt_mutex module 
and instead be made into a sub-property of the scheduler:
task->pi_waiters should be replaced with task->prio_boosters being a 
pi_list of struct prio_booster representing something, which temporarely 
wants to boost a task.
A rt_mutex_waiter should of course contain a prio_booster which is added 
to owner->prio_boosters. A work queue element should contain a prio_booster.
When boosting a RCU reader a prio_booster is added  to the reader's 
prio_boosters.
Such a system will correctly deal with boosters going away in arbitrary 
order. Something which is not strait forward when each user of boosting is 
trying to do it on their own.
