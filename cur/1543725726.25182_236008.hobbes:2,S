uinput support is now committed to scr_linux.c.  I am using the exernal
keyboard of my bluetooth capable braille display to type this email already
via uinput :-).  The same layout is used as is configured on the box.
Our generic AT2 support maps to VAL_PASSKEY commands and
the AT2 support for Linux maps the AT2 scancode set to what Linux internally
uses for scancodes (a sort of XT scancode set, but not really).
