Yes, it seems as though in the report:
http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0013-mremap.txt
And from the looks of mm/mremap.c
For those who might be in need to update mm/mremap.c I extracted the
patch from 2.4.24 and tested on 2.6.0.
You might just patch 2.6.0 with the exact same patch which
is in 2.6.

But does grsec for 2.4 guard against this? I doubt it, but I am no guru.
Does anyone knowledgeble enough have an answer?

Maciej
