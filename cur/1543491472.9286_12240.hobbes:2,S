Hello,
I know that the write support for NTFS is dangerous, but as I can no more
use my WinNT partition (in fact my broter :-)...) because I have replaced
one file (hal.dll) with a new one, and NT tell me at the very beginning of
the boot process that the file is corrupt...
I manage under linux to write new files, but not to erase or replace existing
ones, is there a special tricks for that?
I have to say I realy like the option single of linux, and the ability to boot
from fd...
Thanks,
	Greg						ICQ:16624071
