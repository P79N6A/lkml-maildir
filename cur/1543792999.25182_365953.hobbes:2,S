Probably only super-user should be permitted to read the usage information
about other processes.  Allowing anyone to read anyone else's rusage would
open up a bunch of side channels that sound pretty dangerous.  For instance,
user #1 might be able to mount a timing attack against crypto code being
executed by user #2, and that doesn't sound good.
