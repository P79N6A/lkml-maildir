heh - am i the only one impressed by the consistency of the blue line in 
this graph? :-) [ and the green line looks a bit like a .. staircase? ]
i've meanwhile tested hackbench 90 and the performance difference 
between -ck and -cfs-devel seems to be mostly down to the more precise 
(but slower) sched_clock() introduced in v2.6.23 and to the startup 
penalty of freshly created tasks.
Putting back the 2.6.22 version and tweaking the startup penalty gives 
this:

('lowres-sched-clock' is the patch i sent in the previous mail. 'dsp' is 
a disable-startup-penalty patch that is in the latest sched-devel.git)
i have used your .config to conduct this test.
can you reproduce this with the (very-) latest sched-devel git tree:
  git-pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched-devel.git
plus with the low-res-sched-clock patch (re-) attached below?
