I don't know how you could have that sort of list.  We have some idea
of the potential size of that list and it's huge.  Based on the lease
requests back to us (BK is lease based, it connects back to us once a
month), we estimate that there well over 10,000 clones of the Linux kernel
in BK.  If even 1/10th of those are going to have a patch for Linus that's
1,000 potential patches.  Pretty hard to keep that all in your head.
