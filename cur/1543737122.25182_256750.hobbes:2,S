I've looked at this more on 2.6
If a driver only calls tty_flip_buffer_push(),
with low_latency cleared, it is still possible for
flush_to_ldisc() to run concurrently on SMP machines.
* IRQ on proc 0, flush_to_ldisc work queued for events/0
* events/0 processes work item:
   1) work->pending cleared (work can now be queued again)
   2) work function runs on proc 0
While work function is running on proc 0:
* IRQ on proc 1, flush_to_ldisc work queued for events/1
* events/1 processes work item:
   1) work->pending cleared (work can now be queued again)
   2) work function runs on proc 1
flush_to_ldisc/ldisc->receive_buf do not set TTY_DONT_FLIP
and I see no other mechanism to serialize flush_to_ldisc
That means the buffers can flip while running in
ldisc->receive_buf() which reads from the buffers.
This is contrived, and timing may prevent
this from actually occurring in practice, but it
seems to indicate a hole that needs to be plugged.
I wrong in my reading of the code?
