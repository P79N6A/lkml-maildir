Subject: [PATCH 1/6] signals: move the definition of __group_complete_signal() up
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/8/53

Move the unchanged definition of __group_complete_signal() so that send_signal
can see it. To simplify the reading of the next patches.
