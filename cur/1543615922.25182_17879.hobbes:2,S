    After some time, ranging from 1 to 48 hours, mysql quits in an
    unclean fashion (dies leaving tables improperly closed) with a dump
    in the mysql log file that looks like:

    Which the Mysql support team says appears to be memory corruption.
    Since this has happened on 4 different machines, and one of them had
    memtest86 run on it (coming up clean), they seem (witness Sasha's
    post) to think this may have something to do with the memory
    handling in the kernel. 
    I haven't run it on a kernel that has debugging enabled yet,
    partially because I've been tracing a completely unrelated problems
    with our hard drives (IBM GXP 75G drives made in Hungary during the
    first 3 months of 2001), and partially because the only way to get
    this to happen is to put the database in production, which results
    in a crash, which takes our site offline, which costs us money and
    pisses off our users. Right now we're running on a sun e4500, and
    it's stable, so until we get the other problem worked out, we're
    waiting to see on this one.
