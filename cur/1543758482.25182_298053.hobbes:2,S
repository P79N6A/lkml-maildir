Subject: status of the USB ov511.c driver in kernel 2.6?

I noticed the following regarding the drivers/usb/media/ov511.c driver:
- it's not updated compared to upstream:
  - version 1.64 is neither version 2 nor the latest 1.x version 1.65
- there's no *_decomp.c module in the kernel sources
Are there any reasons why the upstream driver can't be resynced with the 
kernel?
