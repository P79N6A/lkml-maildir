You did run make install? Do you have a custom install script in
/sbin/installkernel?
The vmlinux you see is the uncompressed kernel. If you compiled with
make bzImage, zImage, etc the resulting compressed kernel is at
arch/<your arch>/boot/. You then either run make install or 
	cp ./System.map arch/<your arch>/boot/<kernel> /boot
