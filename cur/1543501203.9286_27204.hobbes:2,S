Hello,
I'm thinking about the issues of the use of spinlocks in the Cyclades
async driver. However, I have a very minimal idea on how spinlocks work.
Before you ask: yes, I've read the Documentation/spinlocks.txt and the
include/asm/spinlock.h files.
The biggest issue is that we're talking about multiport serial cards,
which means several devices under one card, one IRQ, and sometimes one
chip (the CD1400 controls 4 ports simultaneously). Thus, the access
control should be done in three levels:
- one spinlock for regions that are accessed inside the interrupt handler;
- one for regions that are specific to each port;
- one for regions that are specific to each chip;
Plus, these regions overlap, so how to decide which spinlock to use at
that specific case?? Plus, how to synchronize the spinlock calls?? Plus, 
how to control the spinlock (if needed) from inside interrupt handlers??
Well, I have tons of questions. As I know you're all busy, I'd like (if
possible) some pointers about spinlocks (if possible, about spinlocks _in
Linux_ ...). Books, URL's, src code, etc. ... anything is welcome. If you
are willing to help with the code as well, you're welcome too ... ;)
Can you guys help me ?!?!?
Thanks in advance for your time.
Regards,
Ivan
