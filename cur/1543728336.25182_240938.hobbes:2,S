Actually, the answer is to most intents and purposes "yes".  You are
technically correct: there's no way to disable DMA in SCSI.  However,
once a device is quiesced, it has no outstanding commands, so there will
be no outstanding DMA to that device.  When all devices on a host have
been quiesced, then there will be no DMA at all going on *except* if the
user initiates any via another interface (like sending a device probe or
doing a unit scan).  The guarantee should be strong enough for swsusp to
proceed, but we can look at quiescing a host properly (however, we'd
need to move to a better host state model than we currently possess).
