Yes. Con Kolivas' interactivity patches that have been merged into
mainline mean that if Mandrake's XFree86 runs at a negative nice value,
this will affect interactivity. Please set it to 0.
FWIW for others reading this thread, in Debian it is a matter of running
'dpkg-reconfigure xserver-common'.
(As I was writing this message I realized that Nick Piggin had already
answered, but because of the little Debian factoid I'm deciding to send
it anyway.)
