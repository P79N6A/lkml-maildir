We really need to teach your automated tool about context.
The NULL case can only occur for XFRM_MSG_FLUSHPOLICY.
Look at the km_policy_notify() call sites.  You can even see from the
net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c:xfrm_send_policy_notify() implementation of this
callback that for XFRM_MSG_FLUSHPOLICY the "xp" argument is ignored.
