CLOCK_*_CPUTIME_ID are not clocks in a real sense. The user should
never choose those for real time. The most accurate time is provided by
CLOCK_REALTIME by the kernel.

Yes the information is available also through the /proc filesystem. But it
should also be available through clock_gettime and friends. The patch
makes these calls posix compliant nothing more. Increasing the accuracy
of the timers better be done with the revision of the time handling
proposed by John Stultz.

I am happy that you are at least discussing the issue.
I did not see a clean implementation of CLOCK_*_CPUTIME_ID,
nor that the issue of providing additional clocks via clock_gettime
was addressed.
