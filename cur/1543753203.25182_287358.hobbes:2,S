"right thing"? You have a very strange definition of "right". The x86 is 
pretty much the only architecture still in use that passes everything on 
the stack by default, and even there it's considered pretty painful (and 
is not true of FP arguments).
If a debugger cannot handle arguments in registers, it by definition 
cannot handle things like alpha/ppc/mips/xxx, so I'd say that the 
debugger is seriously broken.
