OSS didn't do that "itself". He must have had a (maybe init-)script that
saved the mixer-settings at shutdown (or whenever) and restored the
values at startup.
Definitly not a kernel issue. (Hint, time for a FAQ on "common" issues
that are not problem of the kernel. And maybe a "RESOLVE because it's a
FAQ"-Status :-)
e.g. Debian does install an init-script it when you install the
"aumix"-package.
