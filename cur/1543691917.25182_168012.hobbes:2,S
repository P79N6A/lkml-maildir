Bad example ;)
While it is true that the Linux VM doesn't do a whole
lot of the things a VM should do, there is also the
fact that the VM problem space has gotten a lot harder
over the last decade due to the fact that the size of
disk and memory has grown way faster than the speed of
disk and memory.
Simply put, nowadays it takes more than 10 times as
long to swap out a process then it took 10 years ago.
This puts interesting constraints on the design of a
VM...
