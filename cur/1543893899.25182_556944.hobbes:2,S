Well, even the FSF lawyers did, but one of the reasons I never wanted to 
do the copyright assignments(*) is exactly because I think people need to 
make their own judgments on what the GPLv2 means. In the end, the only 
thing that really matters is what a judge says (after appeals etc), and 
the fact is, any license will always have gray areas where people disagree 
about interpretation.
And I actually am of the very firm opinion that a world with gray areas 
(and purple, and pink, and green) is a hell of a lot better than one where 
everything is black-and-white. Only lawyers want a black-and-white world.
So I would actually *encourage* other people to sue over their GPLv2 
interpretations, as they have done in Germany (and as IBM has done in the 
US). I'd sue based on _my_ reading of it, but hey, while my opinion is 
obviously always correct, I recognize that I live in a world where not 
everybody else always sees that.
[ (*) Obviously, the *biggest* reason not to do copyright assignments is 
  that they are just a total pain in the ass to do, and cause tons of 
  totally pointless paperwork. So "Linus is lazy and not interested in 
  being a lawyer" is obviously the primary reason for the lack of 
  assignments. I'm just much happier with people owning their own code 
  outright. ]
Of course, I also realize that suing people over license violations is a 
big pain in the ass, and in that sense while I "encourage" people to 
assert their own copyrights, I would obviously also say that it's almost 
certainly not worth doing if it's in a "gray" area. But that, in the end, 
has to be the copyright owners own decision!

Indeed. And it's _fine_ to even be in it "just to make a quick buck". We 
do want all kinds of input. I think the community is much healthier having 
lots of different reasons for people wanting to be involved, rather than 
concentrating on just some specific reason.
For some it's the technology. For some it's the license. For some it's 
just a thing to pass boredom. Others like to learn. Whatever. It's all 
good!
