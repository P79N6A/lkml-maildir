There's still some aliasing outlines on a bunch of them and I'm a bit
puzzled why there's an SGI logo on the MIPS penguin but not on the SGI
penguin.
Ideally, it'd be preferable to have .pnms in the source and a quick prog
in tools/ to build the include files as part of the makefile. Source
should be editable.
While I'm at it, may I suggest trading the gray background for black with
the penguin surrounded by a halo effect? It enhances his already, erm,
Buddha-esque appearance, to say nothing of "holy penguin pee".
