Subject: 2.5.27 RAID1 not shutting down at halt/reboot???

Linux 2.5.27 running over a redhat 7.3 distro...
I've got the raid1/md stuff working correctly, but the system doesn't
shut
down the raid arrays at reboot/halt/poweroff...
A quick look at the md_notify_reboot code in drivers/md.c line 3174
reveals:
    printk(KERN_INFO "md: stopping all md devices.\n");
    return NOTIFY_DONE;
!!! followed by the md array shutdown code, which is obviously never
called.
Is there a reason for this?  Should _something_else_ be shutting down
/read-only switching the raid arrays at system halt?
