Hi Everybody,
 I have recently upgraded from Redhat Linux 7.1 kernel
version 2.4.2 to 2.4.10. I am trying to insert a
driver module "code.o" (which was perfectly fine in the previous kernel)into
the new Kernel. But on insmod i get
an error:-
"kernel-module version mismatch. code.o was compiled
for kernel version 2.4.2-2 while this kernel is
version 2.4.10"
 Although i am able to insert the driver module with
the -f(force) switch. But this results in a faulty
operation of the driver module. Rather i get an OOps message
I have tried recompiling the source of gcc in this new kernel but
that has also not solved this problem. Help will be
appreciated! Thank you.
Kashif!
