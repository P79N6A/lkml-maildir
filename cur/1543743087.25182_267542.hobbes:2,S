This one initially booted fine on my SMP workstation at the office. Ran 
for about 1 hr. 10 mins. then locked with no indications as to why. Then 
failed reboot after hitting the reset switch. The last thing that I saw 
on the console seems to match the following that I found in the log:
Nov  2 11:21:49 swdev14 rc: Starting readahead:  succeeded

After the failed reboot a subsequent reboot went fine. This behavior 
seems to be pretty much the same for a while now.
My SMP system at home has been running for for 1 hr. 23 mins. so far. No 
signs of problems.
