Basically yes but the effective scenario is a bit wider. Local actions 
like disallowing execution of rootkits, exploits and other similar malware 
are also interesting. Another example would be enforcing a corporate 
policy on which IM clients shouldn't be used so it is not just fileserver 
scenario in which Linux machines can be compromised.
But really I am not the best person to know all current attack vectors. 
Overall set of requirements and ideas is something we are working on with 
other vendors and hopefully with the community. This is one of the two 
main things my original post was about.
