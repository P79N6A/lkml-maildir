Subject: Sleep during spinlock in TPM driver

I've been working with the TPM driver, and I found that if I opened,
used, then closed the TPM char device very frequently, I would get a
kernel BUG message saying that the kernel tried to sleep while holding
a spinlock.  I think I've isolated the problem to this function, in
drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:
int tpm_release(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
{
        struct tpm_chip *chip = file->private_data;
        spin_lock(&driver_lock);
        file->private_data = NULL;
        chip->num_opens--;
        del_singleshot_timer_sync(&chip->user_read_timer);
        flush_scheduled_work();
        atomic_set(&chip->data_pending, 0);
        put_device(chip->dev);
        kfree(chip->data_buffer);
        spin_unlock(&driver_lock);
        return 0;
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(tpm_release);
I believe that flush_scheduled_work can sleep, correct?  Does anyone
know why this function is called while the spinlock is held?
