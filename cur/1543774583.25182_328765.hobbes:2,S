I seem to remember the comment was more about hardcoded ID tables.
And this was the generic ID code database, which is now maintained out
of the kernel:
/usr/share/misc/pci.ids
	A list of all known PCI ID's (vendors, devices, classes and sub-classes).
That is what I was referring to, that used to be in the kernel.
What this has to do with is whether you believe that it's better to keep
code out until it's perfectly clean, or to let in code that has some
things about it that you don't like, but works, is useful, and the
maintainers seem very willing to fix it later on.
I believe it's better to let stuff in so long as it works and doesn't
break anything, so long as it is being improved to the *real* standards
along the way.  But, this opinion obviously isn't shared by most people
here, so I'm going to stop arguing it now.
