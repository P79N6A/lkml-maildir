I see several possible issues:

Does it show this line when touchpad is being detected? 
Do you have PNPACPI turned on?

Revision 5.3 is suspicious. The last posted one is 1.1
Again, when touchpad is detected, does it show this or 1.{0|1}?

We are trying to talk to AUX port but KBC replies as if data
is coming from the keyboard port.
Does it help if you boot with "usb-handoff" kernel option? Another
one would be "i8042.nomux". Btw, does your laptop have external
PS/2 ports?
