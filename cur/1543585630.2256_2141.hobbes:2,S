I'm not aware of any bugs being found in cramfs recently - unless you 
wanted to use it on Alpha (or anything else where PAGE_SIZE != the 
hard-coded 4096 in mkcramfs.c).
I wouldn't avoid it for those reasons - although if you're _really_ short 
of flash space, the same argument applies as for JFFS2 - a single 
compression stream (tar.gz) will be smaller than compressing individual 
pages like JFFS2 and cramfs do.

Given your stated constraints - you're very short of flash and don't care
too much about the RAM you use, you've may have made the same choice I
would have done.
Bearing in mind that you have to take into account the overhead of the 
initrd which does the untarring - what's the total size of the initrd + 
tarball on the flash, and what size would the corresponding cramfs be?
If you could fit your root filesystem into a cramfs on the flash, I'd do
that instead and use ramfs for the parts which need to be writeable.
