Hello,
Are 2TB possible with an unpatched 2.4.x 64bit-AMD64 kernel? The
partion is supposed to be reiserfs. I read an about 2 years old
discussion about this and Hans Reiser statet that the maximum size is
about 2GB. Unfortunality I don't know what this 'about' depends on.
Furthermore our server for this will be an Opteron and so perhaps this
limit is much higher on 64bit systems.
I really wouldn't like to use the first 2.6.x releases on an important server like this. Also using hardly tested 2.4. patches are not really an option.
Thanks,
	Bernd
