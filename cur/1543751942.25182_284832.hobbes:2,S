Hotplug what?  That's a _very_ general term.  Hotplug CPU?  Hotplug
Memory?  Hotplug SCSI disk?  Hotplug USB device?  Hotplug keyboard?
Hotplug PCI device?  Hotplug IEEE1394 device?  Hotplug PCMCIA device?
The userspace /sbin/hotplug script?  The linux-hotplug script package?
and so on...
They all work differently, as they are all different things.

I do not know anything about iSCSI, sorry.  Try asking on the linux-scsi
mailing list.
