The RPM changelog doesn't contain anything relevant
between 766 and 770:
---CUT---
* Thu Feb 24 2005 Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>
- Use old scheme first when probing USB. (#145273)
* Wed Feb 23 2005 Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>
- Try as you may, there's no escape from crap SCSI hardware. (#149402)
* Mon Feb 21 2005 Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>
- Disable some experimental USB EHCI features.
* Tue Feb 15 2005 Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>
- Fix bio leak in md layer.

Perhaps the changelog is incomplete.  I don't have the
two SRPMs at hand to make a comparison.
By the way, it seems upgrading to 2.6.10-1.770_FC3 just made
the bug much harder to trigger: I've definitely seen it once
again when I had left a shell sitting in an NFS directory
overnight.  I couldn't reproduce it a second time.

You can easily find out by downloading the SRPM.  Now that
Fedora provides a public CVS, perhaps it could be used to
make such investigations directly with the cvsweb interface
without downloading and unpacking a 40MB file.
