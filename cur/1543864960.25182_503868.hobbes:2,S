Subject: [PATCH 1/1] filesystem: Disk Errors at boot-time caused by probe of partitions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/31/346

From: TJ <linux@tjworld.net>
Applies to: up-to and including 2.6.20-rc7 
This rare but critical bug has the potential to cause a hardware failure on disk drives by
allowing the system to repeatedly attempt to seek to sectors beyond the end of the physical
disk, causing sustained 'head banging'.
The bug particularly affects dmraid-managed RAID 1 stripes of the type hde+hdf where the
first physical disk hde contains a standard partition table which relates to the larger
logical disk represented by hde+hdf.
The essence is that probing of physical disks that are part of a larger logical disk
should be prevented because those disks will be managed by a driver that loads later in the
boot sequence.
This patch doesn't prevent probing of disks with 'sane' partition table entries.
At boot-time when drives are being probed the disks are scanned for partition tables by
fs/partitions/check.c:check_partition() which makes calls to all registered partition-types.
In the case of the commonly used "msdos" partition-type used for Linux, BSD, Solaris, MS-DOS,
extended and others, the checking is done in
fs/partitions/msdos.c:msdos_partition().
The partition table is only checked for validity based on the 'magic bytes' 55AA in the boot
sector. The sector values in the partition table are copied without any checks to ensure they
are within the bounds of the disk device. 
As a result, block devices are created based on the partition structures and then various
file-systems are given the task of scanning the partition to determine if it is one they will
manage.
This scanning, in a partition that has sector numbers outside the bounds of the device, causes
the errors.

I'm not sure if this bug will affect mdraid RAID-1 stripes, or other software
RAID configurations.
The bug was discovered on a RAID 1+0 array consisting of 4x60GB drives on a
Promise FastTrak PDC20271 2-channel IDE controller (hde+hdf mirrored to hdg+hdh)
with logical block addressing (LBA).
There are 3 prolonged periods of disk-probing each lasting about 20 seconds
during which the 'head banging' is quite scary. The first two occur during the
kernel boot, and the last will occur when a GUI environment such as Gnome
initialises.
In the system where this bug appeared this caused thousands of disk-read errors
during boot (which overflowed dmesg log), and 'head bangs' the drive(s) so hard
that sometimes the system has to be powered off for a considerable time before
the disk(s) will re-initialise.
