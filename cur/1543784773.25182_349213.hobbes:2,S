Debian.  The current Debian installer is unfortunately rather tightly
coupled to devfs; the reasons for choosing it are rooted in boot floppy
size, but the development ("unstable") install image uses 2.6.12 + devfs.
I just had to do a little dance to install it on a machine where
2.6.12 didn't recognize the SATA controller but 2.6.13 counldn't
run the installer.
Note that Debian doesn't need devfs in normal operation; it's just
a bootstrapping tool.
