This looks like "let's make everything freezable and hunt for things that
must not be frozen" kind of approach, but isn't it error-prone?  I mean,
for example, if someone creates a kernel thread that in fact must not
be frozen, but forgets to use the _nofreeze_ call, things will break for
some people and the problem will be worse than the current one,
it seems.
Greetings,
