Ah, that, indeed is the issue.  As far as C is concerned,
the call is NOT a call, but a bit of asm.  If the asm is
correctly written the problem goes away, not because the
register is not modified, but because C is on notice that it
MIGHT be modified and thus not to count on it.
As a practical matter, ebx is used to pass arg1 to the
kernel so it must be changed by the asm code, the further
listing of it beyond the third ":" in the asm inline, will
cause the compiler to not rely on it being further
modified.  The same is true of all the registers used to
pass parameters.  (These are: arg1 ebx, arg2 ecx, arg3 edx,
arg4 esi, arg5 edi, and arg6 ebp.)
So, is there a problem?  Yes, neither the call stub macros
in asm/unistd.h nor those in glibc bother to list the used
registers beyond the third ":".  And, if I understand this
right, the glibc code to save ebx in another register
suffers from the false assumption that THAT register can be
clobbered, but this is only true if C sees the code as a
function, not an inline asm, but most system calls in glibc
are coded as inline asm, not separate functions (not to be
confused with the C inline, which is a separate function).
At least that is how I see it.  Comments?
