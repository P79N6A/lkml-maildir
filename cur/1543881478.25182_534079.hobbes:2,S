the problem is, the glxgears portion of this test is an _inverse_ 
testcase.
The reason? glxgears on true 3D hardware will _not_ use X, it will 
directly use the 3D driver of the kernel. So by renicing X to -19 you 
give the xterms more chance to show stuff - the performance of the 
glxgears will 'degrade' - but that is what you asked for: glxgears is 
'just another CPU hog' that competes with X, it's not a "true" X client.
if you are after glxgears performance in this test then you'll get the 
best performance out of this by renicing X to +19 or even SCHED_BATCH.
