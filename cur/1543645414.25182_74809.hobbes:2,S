Actually there is a file of that name 'uhci-hcd' in the 2.5.39 source, 
which I was talking about.  I was also talking about the uhci-hcd driver 
in the 2.5.39 source which doesn't necessarily have to have a BUG in that 
code.  Here is my call trace:
uhci-irq [uchi-hcd]
usb_hcd_irq_Rfba60562 [usbcore]
handle_IRQ_event
do_IRQ
common_interrupt
page_remove_rmap
zap_pke_range
zap_pmd_range
unmap_page_range
exit_mmap
mmput
exec_mmap
flush_old_exec
load_elf_binary
load_elf_binary
search_binary_handler
do_execve
sys_execve
syscall_call
Code: 83 7b 18 8d 73 04 74 38 c7 04 24 80 f8 88 d0 89 5c 24 04
  <0> Kernel panic:  Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing...
I am apparently hitting a different bug, but it inevitably comes from
the uhci-hcd driver (according to the panic).
