Yes, I completely agree.  Without specific performance numbers it's just
hand waving.  To make it more concrete, I'll work on a compare/contrast
of the interfaces so we have specifics to discuss.

Yup.  Just noting that API without clear users is the type of thing that
is regularly rejected from Linux.

My mistake, it makes perfect sense from ABI point of view.

Are these valid differences?  Or did I misunderstand the batching
mechanism?
1) can't use stack based args, so have to allocate each data structure,
which could conceivably fail unless it's some fixed buffer.
2) complicates the rom implementation slightly where implementation of
each deferrable part of the API needs to have switch (am I deferred or
not) to then build the batch, or make direct hypercall.
3) flushing in smp, have to be careful to manage simulataneous defers
and flushes from potentially multiple cpus in guest.
Doesn't seem these are showstoppers, just differences worth noting.
There aren't as many multicalls left in Xen these days anyway.
