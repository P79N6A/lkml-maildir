Well that sucks.

All these starts, ends and lens are now wrong - they should be changed to
resource_size_t.  But there's no rush on that - please add it to the todo
list.

The `= 0' here is unneeded.  It's also undesirable, since it adds to the size
of vmlinux on-disk.

driver_register() can fail and the driver should check for and handle the
failure.
This mistake happens literally thousands of times and we're trying to fix
it up at present.  An updated patch would be appreciated, please.
