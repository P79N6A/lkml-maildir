x86_64-mm-less-stack-alignment.patch has
cflags-y += $(call cc-option,-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3)
So we _should_ have detected that gcc didn't like =3, so it
should not have been used.
I am suspecting a kbuild glitch: asm-offsets.c tends to be handled
in special ways (ie: it's usually the thing which blows up first)
so perhaps it is somehow avoiding the above does-gcc-support-this test.
Suitable cc's added ;)
