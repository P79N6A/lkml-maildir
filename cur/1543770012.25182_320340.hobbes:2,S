disable_smp() is called only in smp_prepare_cpus() which is not required 
for hotplug. Its currently only required only for startup, and not later.
I changed the ones from __cpuinit to __init, just in functions marked 
with paranoia... i think it can stay cpuinit, unless there is another reason
i didnt catch.
