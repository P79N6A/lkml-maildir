a question i asked a while back, and still haven't seen an answer for
-- given this in include/linux/gfp.h:
  #define GFP_DMA         __GFP_DMA
is there a qualitative difference between these two macros?  is there
*supposed* to be?  if there isn't, one would think that just one
variation would be sufficient.
