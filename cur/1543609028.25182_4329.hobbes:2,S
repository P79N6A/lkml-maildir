	Hi,
	After an important user reported a crash of the IrDA stack, I
did an audit of the disconnect/close code for race conditions. I also
kept in mine to looks for potential skb leaks. Well, that was some
work, but my quest was quite successfull ;-)
	I also fixed a connection setup deadlock that was an old
friend eluding me. And I've been sent an endianess patch that is
necessary for operation on PPC.
	Patches have been on the IrDA mailing list for one week and
have suffered my torture test since, so they are ready to go ;-)
	Regards,
	Jean
