I liked Andrew's vma->page_table_lock suggestion, was imagining we
should migrate in that direction (as you said at the time, needn't
be right now), if only as a discipline to force us away from the
page_table_lock or mmap_sem muddle in (not your version of) mmap.c.
So I had been expecting to shift anonmm in that direction,
needing to do a down_read_trylock around its anon find_vma.
By the way, your and my page_referenced_one do need to take
page_table_lock, but the need for it is very very slender: Dave
took it out a year ago, I persuaded him it had to go back in,
but there's probably some way we can avoid it later on.

I just translated what was there before: I thought I could understand
why it did that on user page tables, but I couldn't understand why it
did it to all the kernel page tables too.
I believe it's related to the fact that page_referenced_one does not
flush TLB after ptep_test_and_clear_referenced: so MMU may not notice
that we have cleared it, and not set it again even though referenced;
so pages referenced very frequently may be treated as unreferenced.
We ought to flush TLB there, but I presume it's been thought
to waste more time than its worth (particularly across cpus).
Probably depends rather on architecture, hence the ppc code.
