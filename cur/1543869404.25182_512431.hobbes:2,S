Johannes, is there any special meaning in "migrate all of powerpc to 
genrtc"? Or is it just porting every single rtc driver to the generic rtc 
API, moving it under drivers/rtc and adjusting its users or are there any 
global changes required to arch/powerpc? Linkstation is now happily using 
a driver under drivers/rtc, whereas originally it also had a "all special" 
driver, and the migration for me wasn't that difficult... Or is there more 
to do for other platforms?
Thanks
Guennadi
