I had a lockup on a boot so I am trying a bit more conservative with
1000UL and ndelay(400) 
I don't think anyone should try any less than this but hey?
This gives my system a safety margin of 16 apic counts.
The v1 patch on my system typically gave a safety delay of 13 counts.
The performance hit with the v2 is still less than with the v1.
With v2 additional delay would only have been present on 2 out of 10
instead of 10 out of 10 with v1.
..APIC TIMER ack delay, reload:16701, safe:16685
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:16657
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:16664
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:16677
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:16691
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:16636
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:16649
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:16660
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:16671
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:16686
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:16635
Although as previously mentioned on my system it takes 28 apic counts
to write an io byte to the south bridge such as an ack in xtpic mode
so v1 was not what you would call slow.
If 28 counts was a benchmark then I could still try v2 up to about 1750UL and
still be quicker than the xtpic.
