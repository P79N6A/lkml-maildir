Hi,
Here are some small PCI patches for 2.6.7-rc1.  They are a few pci id
updates, janitor fixes, and a suspend bus fix patch.  They have all been
in the last few -mm releases.
Please pull from:

thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
