I just wanted to point out that it is dangerous ground.
Alan did already, but I repeat it:
[Given the glibc2 clone wrapper; untested]
void start_stopped_thread(void (*func)(void *), void *arg, void *stack) 
{ 
	struct arg { 
		void (*func)(void *); 
		void *real_arg; 
	} a;  	
	pid_t pid; 
	int status; 
	a.func = func;
	a.real_arg = arg; 	
	pid = clone( trampoline, &a,  stack, CLONE_VM | ... );  
	waitpid(pid, &status, WUNTRACED); 
	if (WIFSTOPPED(status)) { 
		...
	} 	
	
}	
void trampoline( void * f) 
{
	struct arg *a = (struct arg *) f; 
	kill(getpid(),SIGSTP); 
	a->func(a->real_arg); 
}	
It is essentially the same work the kernel would do for a CLONE_STOPPED, just 
in user space.
