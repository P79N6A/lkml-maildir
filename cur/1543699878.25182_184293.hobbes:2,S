Yeah. But at least it doesn't look like it would lock up the machine by
just being horribly wrong (like the reset code would). After all, all it
does is to wait for the requests to finish.
So I'm hoping that with just the reset routine basically removed, the
thing might limp along. But since I can't test it (and am not that
horribly motivated by it), I'll just see if somebody reports any success
at all with that patch.
