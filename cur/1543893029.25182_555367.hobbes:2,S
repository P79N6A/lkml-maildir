No. You still need my patch to fix the current breakage.
This patch makes hugetlbfs also use same naming convention as regular 
shmem for its
name. This is not absolutely needed, its a nice to have. Currently, user 
space tools
can't depend on the filename alone, since its not unique (based on kry).
