The comment above is funny:
349 /*
350 * The HASH Table is a register array of 2 32-bit registers.
351 * It is treated like an array of 64 bits. We want to set
352 * bit BitArray[hash_value]. So we figure out what register
353 * the bit is in, read it, OR in the new bit, then write
354 * back the new value. The register is determined by the
355 * upper 7 bits of the hash value and the bit within that
356 * register are determined by the lower 5 bits of the value.
How can you use seven bits to choose between two registers?
And they're not using the lower 5 bits, but rather bits 30..26.
