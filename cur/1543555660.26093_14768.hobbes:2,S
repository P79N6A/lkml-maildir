I have both IDE and SCSI drives in my machine, but have only seen
corruption on the SCSI drives.  That doesn't mean that the problem only
exists on the SCSI drives - they IDE ones are not frequently written to.
I have disabled DMA myself on all my IDE drives because if I enable it,
the IDE driver always chokes the first time they are anything like
hammered (well, it always used to - I haven't actually tried it recently).
