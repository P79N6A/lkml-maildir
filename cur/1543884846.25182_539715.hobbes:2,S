Ok. We then need to look at partial list management. It could be that the 
sequence of partials is reversed. The problem is that I do not really 
have time to concentrate on performance right now. Stability comes 
first. We will likely end up putting some probes in there to find out 
where the overhead comes from.

Hmmm.... Then it was not affected by slab_max_order? Try 
slab_min_order=1 or 2 to increase that?
