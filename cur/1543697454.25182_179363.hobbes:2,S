Some looking around shows that it works correctly on a SuSE box with
	GNU assembler version 2.13.90.0.18 (i486-suse-linux) using BFD version 2.13.90.0.18 20030121 (SuSE Linux)
	GNU ld version 2.13.90.0.18 20030121 (SuSE Linux)
but is broken on RH Fedora core 1:
	GNU assembler version 2.14.90.0.6 (i386-redhat-linux) using BFD version 2.14.90.0.6 20030820
	GNU ld version 2.14.90.0.6 20030820
So it definitely _does_ work in some versions, and the bug appears to be 
new to binutils 2.14, with 2.13 doing the right thing.
You can trivially see if with a simple assembly file like
	start:
		.long 1,2,3,a
	a=(.-start)/4
where 2.13.90 as shipped by SuSE will get it right (and generate a list of
1,2,3,4), while 2.14.90 from Fedora core will generate 1,2,3,16.
