who would use such undocumented way?
one of the big software developers perhaps?
for example oracle to pick someone at random without meaning any offence
if that were the case then it wouldn't remain a secret for very long, now would it?
it would also have to be done in un-priviledged mode (or else it would have to go
into the kernel for all to see) or be a binary-only module (alarm bells ringing)
please explain the flaws in this logic?
now on the other hand - if you're running a closed source OS...
