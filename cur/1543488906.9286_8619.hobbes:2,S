Toshiba has started shipping their latest laptops in a plastic wrapper that
states that by opening the wrapper you agree to the Microsoft Licence
Agreement.  (i.e. you cannot return the MS portions to get out of paying cash
to Bill.)  They seem to be sucking up to Microsoft in a big way.  (Which is too
bad because the Libretto is a pretty cool machine.)
I guess I will just have to get a Sony Viao.  (When and if I can afford it...)
