But in this case the result of testing the condition becomes useless
after spin_unlock_irqrestore - someone might grab the lock and change
things.   Therefore the calling code would need to add a loop around
wait_event_lock - and the wait_event_* macros were added precisely to
encapsulate such a loop and avoid the need to code it manually.
