Well, if the console is switched to medium raw or raw mode, nothing
happens.

And the ages old method that X has been using before the existence of
the input layer still works fine, as far as I know.

I'm fine with that, I just wonder whether attacking it on the input
layer side is the right way to do it: If you want to disable the

That way, we don't have to figure out which exact kernel input handlers
are console and which are not.
