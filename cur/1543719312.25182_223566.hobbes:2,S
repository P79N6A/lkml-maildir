The issue is a xAPIC thing, and the both kernel-level and user-level are
applicable to x86_64 as well. 
The kernel does the default IRQ balancing, without assuming a user-level
irq balancing (because it's a distribution issue). If the user-level has
better knowledge, it just does a write to /proc/irq/N/smp_affinity to
bind that IRQ to a particular CPU, as Arjan's program is doing. In other
words, the kernel-level does _not_ move the ones bound by the
user-level.

Today Linux is used for various configurations, including the ones that
substantially limit the set of user commands, libraries, etc. So we want
to keep it.
