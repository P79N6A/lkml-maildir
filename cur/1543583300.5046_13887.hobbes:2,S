I've seen hanging rsync over ssh more than once, while sending much data
from an x86 running Linux (late 2.3.x) to Sparc/Solaris2.5.1 over ssh
1.2.26.  I had a feeling that it was triggered by certain data patterns
because it often stopped at the same spot after restart (and therefore
I attributed it to a bug in rsync).  I did not investigate further.
