Sigh. Thanks to ALL the people who are writing in to tell me this.
I had the misfortune to post from a machine with an old version of elm
(thanks to it being effectively offline longterm when I updated every
other machines elm).
Al together now ... please all edit your mail folder (what, you didn't
compile folder editing into your mua?), and replace "100" with "2000"
in the post with the title
    Subject: proc config
that is now nestling snuggly at the end of your incoming sorted queue.
It went a bit like this:

The patch is set up to auto-integrate into the make files.
