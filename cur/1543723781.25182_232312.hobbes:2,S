Hello,
Concerning my issue with ftp'ing from remote sites,
using these sysctl's I was able to get the performance
back:
net.ipv4.tcp_default_win_scale=0
net.ipv4.tcp_moderate_rcvbuf=0
2.6.7-bk18 w/out sysctls:
2573621 bytes received in 2e+02 seconds (12 Kbytes/s)
ftp> by
2.6.7-bk18 w/sysctls:
2573621 bytes received in 0.69 seconds (3.6e+03
Kbytes/s)
ftp> by
I am curious why I must set these on the newer kernels
or is this something that is being addressed?  Is this
an issue with firewalls?
Thank you for your time.
