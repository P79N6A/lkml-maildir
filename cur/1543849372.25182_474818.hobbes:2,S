Yep, that's exactly what I was trying to say.
This is also why the rest of the kernel PCI code, and even things
like "lspci" from PCI utils do not print out the bridge control
register for host->pci bridges.  It's contents are %100 undefined
for host->pci bridges, yet this pci_fixup_video() code is testing
those bits without checking what kind of bridge it is looking at.

At the core of this is the "definition" that 0xc0000 is a location in
physical RAM that the video ROM might be stored.  While this might
be a %100 valid definition on IA64, x86 and x86_64, it simply is not
on other platforms such as sparc64.
In fact even the existence of any RAM at all at that address is
not guarenteed.  I have a few systems where physical RAM starts
at some high physical address, such as 0x80000000.
Even if presence were guarenteed, you can't access this memory using
ioremap() and things like readl() and friends, which is exactly what
callers of pci_map_rom() are doing.  Accesses using readl() use
non-cacheable transactions which result in bus errors, and furthermore
the first argument to ioremap() is not a physical address, it's an
architecture-defined "address cookie" that must be setup by platforms
specific code.
