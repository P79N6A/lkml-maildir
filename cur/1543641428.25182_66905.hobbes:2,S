I sort-of glanced through the 2.4 paths and it appears that in all of the
places where it could do a page_cache_get/release, that would never happen
because of other parts of the page state.
Like: it can't be in pagecache, so we won't run writepage, and
it can't have buffers, so we won't run try_to_release_page().
Of course, I might have missed a path.  And, well, generally: ugh.
