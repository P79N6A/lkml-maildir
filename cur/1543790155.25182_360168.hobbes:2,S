The WARN_ON is pointless because we guarantee that the stack is always
64-bit aligned on signal handler setup and return.

pte_write() just says that the page _may_ be writable.  It doesn't say
that the MMU is programmed to allow writes.  If pte_dirty() doesn't
return true, that means that the page is _not_ writable from userspace.
If you write to it from kernel mode (without using put_user) you'll
bypass the MMU read-only protection and may end up writing to a page
owned by two separate processes.
