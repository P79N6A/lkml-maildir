Hi Jens,
  I ran this (well, cut-two) on a 4-way box with 4GB of memory and a
modified qlogic fibre channel driver with 32disks hanging off it, without
any problems.  The test used was SpecFS 2.0
  Peformance is definitely up - but I can't give an exact number, as the
run with this patch was compiled with no-omit-frame-pointer for debugging
any probs.
  I did change the patch so that bounce-pages always come from the NORMAL
zone, hence the ZONE_DMA32 zone isn't needed.  I avoided the new zone, as
I'm not 100% sure the VM is capable of keeping the zones it already has
balanced - and adding another one might break the camels back.  But as the
test box has 4GB, it wasn't bouncing anyway.
