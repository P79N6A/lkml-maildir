Hi Alan,
It's not fixed in 2.4.18 (released version).
At least, the array of HPT chipsets doesn't have the 372 entry.  Does it
fix it neatly (if the index of the revision is above the array label it as
unknown)?
It doesn't seem to as line 225 in drivers/ide/hpt366.c seems to just use
class_rev as an index in to the chipset_names array (which will bomb out
it it tries to access class_rev=5).
Any chance of getting the earlier patch submitted to the mainstream Kernel
by someone who Linus will listen to ;-)  (P.S. Linus, if you're listening
sorry for the aspersion that you ignore patches from people, it's just
that I am a lowly Kernel newbie who you won't know/trust (YET!)).
Cheers,
