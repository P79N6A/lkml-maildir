The object of this infrastructure is to get a unified interface for
resource management, irrespective of the resource that is being managed.
As I mentioned in my earlier email, subsystem experts are the ones who
will finally decide what type resource controller they will accept. With
VM experts' direction and advice, i am positive that we will get an
excellent memory controller (as well as other controllers).
As you might have noticed, we have gone through major changes to come to
community's acceptance levels. We are now making use of all possible
features (kref, process event connector, configfs, module parameter,
kzalloc) in this infrastructure.
Having a CPU controller, two memory controllers, an I/O controller and a
numtasks controller proves that the infrastructure does handle major
resources nicely and is also capable of managing virtual resources.
Hope i reduced your worries (at least some :).
