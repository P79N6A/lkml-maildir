This simply fundamentally isn't true, last I looked.
At least older alphas do _not_ support atomic byte accesses, and if you
want atomic accesses you need to either use the defined smp-atomic
functions (ie things like the bit set operations), or you need to use 
"int", which afaik all architectures _do_ support atomic accesses to.
