   Please read the text I've written and you've quoted a bit more carefully.
It says that I propose pci_request_device() allocating _the_resources_, so that
the problems we were speaking about some mails ago will be solved and usual
drivers still won't need to do any resource magic -- they'll just say
"grab this device and anything that comes with it".

   Well, in this case my old "just allocate the whole PCI device and
don't care about resources" would still work since a driver for such a device
would of course need to request the legacy ports explicitly as they are
not a part of any PCI regions.
   But anyway, I feel that making pci_request_device() allocating all
the resources is a better solution.
				Have a nice fortnight
