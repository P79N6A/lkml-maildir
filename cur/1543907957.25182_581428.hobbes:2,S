Chris - 
I appreciate the response but on the face of it I do not know if I
believe that this is the answer.  I am not the sharpest knife in the
drawer but the following two items still cast a doubt on the answer.
1.  This happens even when the system is rebooted via the shutdown -r
command - not much time for my fat fingers to get in there and dork up
the system clock.
2.  As I stated in the original note, this does NOT happen with kernel
2.6.22.1 - so far I have only seen it with the 2.6.23-rc1, rc2, and
rc2-git1 kernels.
Other than this I would say you were spot on in your analysis.  Maybe
there is something I don't understand here.  If so, pardon me for being
"Thick as a brick"
