I see the same problem on linux-2.6.20-rc1-mm1 
The patch below fixes this, although I don't understand why 
this has become an issue just now:
Index: linux-2.6.20-rc1-mm1/kernel/mutex.c

        spin_unlock_mutex(&lock->wait_lock, flags);
 }
It obvious that this is the proximal cause of the failure of 
the double_unlock_mutex() mutex self-test.  However, both
the double-unlock test, and this clear_owner() call, are 
in linux-2.6.19-git7, which doesn't fail this test. So I conclude
that __mutex_unlock_common_slowpath() is never taken in 2.6.19
but is always taken on 2.6.20-rc1 (in particular, is taken
during the double-unlock test).
I don't know why that would be. 
It might be wise to add a test to make sure the slowpath
is taken only when it should be taken? Its sort of scary 
to think that it might be always taken, and that no one 
notices the problem...
I'm gonna be out until after Christmas. -- and so, 
Merry Christmas!
