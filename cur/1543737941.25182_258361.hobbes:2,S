Yes.  Ivan thinks there are cases that
sort-generic-pci-fixups-after-specific-ones.patch won't fix, and I

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
