I don't have a K8 box yet :(, so I cannot confirm either ways.  
But I thought newer opterons need to use  ACPI_NUMA instead...
<Kconfig quote>
config K8_NUMA
       bool "Old style AMD Opteron NUMA detection"
       depends on NUMA
       default y
       help
         Enable K8 NUMA node topology detection.  You should say Y here if
         you have a multi processor AMD K8 system. This uses an old
         method to read the NUMA configurtion directly from the builtin
         Northbridge of Opteron. It is recommended to use X86_64_ACPI_NUMA
         instead, which also takes priority if both are compiled in.

Even if K8 detection is used, cpu_pda will have memory allocated from node0
which is not different from the current state.  So this patch helps Opterons
and EM64t boxes which use ACPI_NUMA, right?  Also the newer opteron boxes
and em64t NUMA boxes can now get node local memory for static per-cpu areas.
Thanks,
Kiran
