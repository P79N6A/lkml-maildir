Boy was today a bad day for my main box!
1) Compiles crash with Sig 11 (Cyrix Instead 6x86L 2x core
   but not overclocked).
2) ncurses refused to use libc.so.6 (I have libc.so soft linked to
   libc.so.6 linked to libc-2.0.7.so).
3) I untar'd glibc-2.0.7pre6 (and thread and crypt) and after I finally
   managed to get it to compile I tried to make install. But it didn't
   go into /lib. Do I have to manually install it in /lib?
Any hints on how to fix any of the above? All this to upgrade to
2.2.0pre9 (I have problems there too but I shouldn't issue warnings
until I manage to get everything else fixed first).
