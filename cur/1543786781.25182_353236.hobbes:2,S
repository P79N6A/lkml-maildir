I checked with 1) a minimal drivers on a preempt kernel and 2) with a
few more drivers (usb mouse) and a non-preempt kernel. Both didn't wake
up when I suspended after a few days of uptime (right after boot, it's
fine). The default Ubuntu kernel is a preempt-enabled 2.6.10 kernel and
it always resumed from suspend, even with usb devices plugged in (I
still had to reload the driver though). As I said, it's not trivial to
test, because it takes a while before the bug occurs.
