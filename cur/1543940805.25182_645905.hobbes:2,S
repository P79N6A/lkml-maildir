True, but can a closed or suspended UART wake the system? I guess it
could if it's really a GPIO interrupt that triggers the wakeup :-)

Yes, indeed. I was just pointing out that "Frozen" doesn't necessarily
mean what the datasheet says -- we can disable a lot of clocks manually.

Right. I'm not all that familiar with the power management mechanisms
in the kernel yet, but this thread has made a few things much clearer.
