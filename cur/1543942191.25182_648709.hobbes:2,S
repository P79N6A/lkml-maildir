Yes, there is something like that for SCSI target as well. It's a "local 
initiator" or "local nexus", see 
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.scsi/31288
 and 
http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?message_id=
%3c463F36AC.3010207%40vlnb.net%3e 
for more info about that.
In fact, existence of local nexus is one more point why SCST is better, 
than STGT, because for STGT it's pretty hard to support it (all locally 
generated commands would have to be passed through its daemon, which 
would be a total disaster for performance), while for SCST it can be 
done relatively simply.
