Does this patch replace Bastian's patch, below?
From: Bastian Blank <bastian@waldi.eu.org>
Fix the problem that localversion files were ignored if the tree lives in
a path which contains a ~.  It changes the test to apply to the filename
only.
Debian allows versions which contains ~ in it.  The upstream part of the
version is in the directory name of the build tree and we got weird results
because the localversion files was just got ignored in this case.
