I'm happy to as long as I'm cc'd.

IMHO the pm interface should be split up as following:
        (1) Battery status, power status, UPS status polling. It
        should be possible for lots of processes to do this
        simultaneously. [That does not prohibit a single process
        querying the kernel and all the others querying it.]
        (2) Funky events happening to the physical machine, like a
        button being pressed, the case being closed, etc. [Should this
        include battery low warnings, power status changes? I don't
        know.]
        (3) Sending the machine to sleep, turning it off. It should be
        possible to do this from userspace ;-)
Am I missing anything? Of course (1) and (2) could be combined into a
single daemon.
ATM the area is fraught with incompatibility. There are a ridiculous
number of power management systems - one per architecture almost. Each
has a different kernel-userspace interface. Every UPS has its own
interface too (?) ;-)

Why?
As far as I see it, only some people need polling capabilities -
i.e. those on battery or UPS. Why should they be subjected to the
bloat etc. And those on battery might want multiple policies as Alan
pointed out.
