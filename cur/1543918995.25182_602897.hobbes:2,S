I've run rmap-test with -M (use remap_file_pages) and
remap-test from ext3-tools, but not remap_file_pages for some reason.
I'll now add remap_file_pages soon.
Maybe those other 2 tests aren't strong enough (?).
Or maybe they don't return a non-0 exit status even when they fail...
(I'll check.)

quick grep didn't find any for me.
