 Thanks for the reply,
 I have to admit I do not even have a clue how to get access to
 the directory table of a mounted vfat device. The whole idea
 is for manipulating the ordering of mp3-players which
 (on some devices) seems to dictate the play order.
 So if someone could point me to a good documentation
 I would appreciate it.
 Regards
 Sebastian
