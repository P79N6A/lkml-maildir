Only one problem, I'm using devfs, so the major/minor means nothing.  But
from looking at online docs, the normal name for the high bit devices is
nst0, and that just happens to be the device I am using.
But that does explain why the soft error count is always 0 after doing a
tar, since tar closes the device when it's done, and you stated that it
loses all history after that.  A subsequent call to mt would therefore
report 0.
I guess the only way to get the info is to hack a call to retrieve the soft
errors into tar, but I was hoping to avoid that.
Thanks for the info.
Evan
