Which is an example of the brokenness of the security model - its
fragileness in the face of manipulation of the file tree leads to
inflexibility.  So for example, if you wanted to _protect_ a process
that does mount things as part of its legitimate purpose, e.g. by
limiting what it can access to prevent it from taking untrustworthy
inputs, then you are out of luck - it is either confined and can't mount
or not confined and can mount.
