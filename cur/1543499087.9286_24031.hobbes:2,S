	Plan 9 ones. I.e. namespace (how the trees are joined) is a
process attribute. clone() (rfork() in case of Plan 9) has a new flag -
whether to share a namespace. fork() *does* share it. Another part of
namespace being the bindings - think of VFS-level links (asymmetrical -
there is a real link and there are links to it, but not involving a
name-parsing in any form). Again, different processes may have different
bindings.

/sbin/init. It can be configured, indeed, but I didn't want to bother with
that back then. It was written to allow clean libc and init upgrades...
