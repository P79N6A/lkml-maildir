What Cardbus controllers does the pcmcia support work with?  (as of 2.3.30)
I do know that omega micro works.  I was interested in a laptop, but I
noticed it had a ricoh cardbus controller.
(I ask here as this is the list listed in the maintainers file for pcmcia)

 Lab tests show that use of micro$oft causes cancer in lab animals
