Sorry? What data? What to decide?
Device name of &|&|&|&|&|& is absolutely legal, nicely loking name.
dev.c _wants_ to load such device and it is problem of kmod,
if it is not able to make this.
It is the first. And the second: each user is allowed to refer to this device.
And it is problem of module to allow to load corresponding module or not
to allow this.
It means that test for CAP_SYS_MODULE is illegal, moving pure policy
issue to improper place.
