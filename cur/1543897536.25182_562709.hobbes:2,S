Hmmm. You seem to be mostly concerned with safely rmmod'ing modules. In
contrast, my main concern with the proposed patch is that it removes the
ability to *insert* a module.
Consider the use case of joe admin who is running enterprise-supported
RHEL or SLES, and wants to try some newfangled LSM FooSecureMod thingie.
So he grabs a machine, config's selinux=0 or apparmor=0 and loads his
own module on boot, and plays with it. He even likes FooSecure, better
than SELinux or AppArmor, and wants to roll it out across his data center.
Without James's patch, he can do that, and at worst has a tainted
kernel. RH or Novell or his favorite distro vendor can fix that with a
wave of the hand and bless FooSecure as a module. With James's patch, he
has to patch his kernels, and then enterprise support is hopeless, to
say nothing of the barrier to entry that "patch and rebuild kernel" is
more than many admins are willing to do.
So to solve the problem James & Kyle are concerned with, and preserve
user choice, how about we *only* remove the ability to rmmod, and leave
in place the ability to modprobe? Or even easier, LSMs that don't want
to be unloaded can just block rmmod, and simple LSMs that can be
unloaded safely can permit it.
