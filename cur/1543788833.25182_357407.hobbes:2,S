Subject: sys_sendfile oops in 2.6.13?

Hi all
I found an (IMHO) silly bug in do_sendfile in 2.6.13.x kernels (at
least in 2.6.13.3 and .4, didn't backtrack to find where it
originated). Without the patch all I apparently get from sys_sendfile
is an oops due to a call in sys_sendfile with ppos being NULL. With the
patch it works OK. Noticed in vsftpd.
The patch may apply with some fuzz as my kernel is somehwat patched but
the gist of the patch is the same anyway
Regards,
 Grzegorz Nosek
