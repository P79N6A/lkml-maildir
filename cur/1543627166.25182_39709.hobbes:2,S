[other errors snipped]
I was able to reproduce this, but then I remembered Jeff Garzik's advice
to always do a make mrproper (that applied to Alan's trees) when you see
this kind of thing.  So, I saved the Mandrake supplied .config somewhere
safe, did a make mrproper, copied the .config back, did make oldconfig,
make dep, make -j3 bzImage (dual PIII machine), and make modules.  The
first time, without the make mrproper, the failure occurred almost
immediately, and now make modules has been cranking away for quite a
while, so it should be OK.  Good luck.
