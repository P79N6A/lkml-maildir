I didn't really start using 3coms until

yes, you can grope through the logs (as part of
the process of puzzling it out) and there are
ways to get the information - but it's so much
nicer to just get the speed and duplex from
an mii-command, on the spot.

Well, like I say it's a mixed bag. We have mail/dns
servers (580 dns domains, 100,000 messages/day)
that have been runing for over 600 days, and not
a hint of trouble from the eepro100 drivers.
OTOH we have some new dell boxes with intel
pro 100 nics where we can quickly get the "eth0
reports no resources" message and poor or no
connectivity with a couple hours of apachebench
on a 100 MB lan.
could be a chipset issue...

I've heard the horror stories about realtek
cards, but they seem to work well for me -
