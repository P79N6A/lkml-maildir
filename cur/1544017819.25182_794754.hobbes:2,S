What would blacklisting these buggy drives achieve?  There isn't
anything that can be done except warn the user that they have known
buggy firmware and let them know they should contact the vendor for a
firmware update.  But until that bug hits, it doesn't seem to
otherwise affect the performance or functionality of the drives.
