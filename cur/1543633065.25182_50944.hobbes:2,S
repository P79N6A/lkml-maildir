Andre,
	It might just be me but I think there is an error within the defines
of the cmd64x.c driver file.
	Looking through the specs for the cmd643 and cmd646 ( my laptop uses
both chips, primary channels only and doesn't play very well with kernel
2.4.x at the moment ) , they show that the configuration register (0x50) is
using bit 2 for channel 0 interrupt status (CFR_INTR_CH0).
	The source specifies this as 0x02, should this not be 0x04 ?
Regards
