No, we don't.  However, because of that dpm_suspend() and device_power_down()
need to be changed not to assume that the removed devices will end up on
dpm_destroy.

Well, it's used by the b43, leds and hwrng drivers as well as by some CPU
hotplug notifiers.  They all will have to be changed along with removing it.

IMO you also should add this change in device_power_down():
@@ -388,18 +343,15 @@ int device_power_down(pm_message_t state
 		struct list_head *entry = dpm_off.prev;
 		struct device *dev = to_device(entry);
-		list_del_init(&dev->power.entry);
 		error = suspend_device_late(dev, state);
 		if (error) {
 			printk(KERN_ERR "Could not power down device %s: "
 					"error %d\n",
 					kobject_name(&dev->kobj), error);
-			if (list_empty(&dev->power.entry))
-				list_add(&dev->power.entry, &dpm_off);
 			break;
 		}
-		if (list_empty(&dev->power.entry))
-			list_add(&dev->power.entry, &dpm_off_irq);
+		if (!list_empty(&dev->power.entry))
+			list_move(&dev->power.entry, &dpm_off_irq);
 	}
 
 	if (!error)
and the analogous one in dpm_suspend().  Otherwise there would be a problem
if suspend_device_late() itself removed the device (same for device_suspend()).
Of course, that would lead to a problem if device_pm_schedule_removal() were
used for the removal, so the last "!list_empty(&dev->power.entry)" is really
not sufficient - until device_pm_schedule_removal() is removed.
Thanks,
