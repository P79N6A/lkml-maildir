The only possible problem I see with that patch is making genapic
dependant on ACPI, which I'm not sure about (for example, if Summit
would want that, but nobody commented back then...Andi, what do you
think?) As for ES7000, it fixes build problem overall, however, maybe it
would be prudent to make it builldable even without its dependency on
ACPI, just for correctness sake, meaning properly #ifdef-ing ACPI parts,
this will make it more versatile (even though I cannot think of
situation it might be used...Andi, what do you think? :)
