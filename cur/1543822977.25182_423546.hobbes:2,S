Well, yes, but some people do *actually* use the latest kernel at home
and not in labs (et al), and as Maciej asked, we are not sure whether
the (whatever) latest patch is needed or not on whatever our current
config is the way the latest stable fixes are announced.
"    [PATCH] fs/locks.c: Fix lease_init (CVE-2006-1860)
    It is insane to be giving lease_init() the task of freeing the lock it is
    supposed to initialise, given that the lock is not guaranteed to be
    allocated on the stack. This causes lockups in fcntl_setlease().
    Problem diagnosed by Daniel Hokka Zakrisson <daniel@hozac.com>
    Also fix a slab leak in __setlease() due to an uninitialised return value.
    Problem diagnosed by BjÃÂ¶rn Steinbrink.

OK, great.  But what does it mean?
It would be nice to have a short explanation of what the fix is for in
real world terms.
