"set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 7 to 59"
is printk()ed from here:
linux-2.6.12-RT/include/asm-i386/mach-default/mach_time.h
<snip>
/*
 * In order to set the CMOS clock precisely, set_rtc_mmss has to be
 * called 500 ms after the second nowtime has started, because when
 * nowtime is written into the registers of the CMOS clock, it will
 * jump to the next second precisely 500 ms later. Check the Motorola
 * MC146818A or Dallas DS12887 data sheet for details.
 *
 * BUG: This routine does not handle hour overflow properly; it just
 *      sets the minutes. Usually you'll only notice that after reboot!
 */
static inline int mach_set_rtc_mmss(unsigned long nowtime)
</snip>
so its a rtc timingrelated.
which PREEMPT_RT / mode 4 was the last one to do it on the fly ?

what is tvtime supposed to do, is it  a wine thing as in "bleu screen"?
