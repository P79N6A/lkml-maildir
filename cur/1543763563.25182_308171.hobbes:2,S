It's a compiler problem.
With gcc 3.3.5:
drivers/ide/ide-cd.c: In function `cdrom_analyze_sense_data':
drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:433: warning: `s' might be used uninitialized in
this function
Looks like the compiler's being stupid about my earlier patch which
makes printk an inline (and it's the only thing in the tree to do so).
gcc-snapshot doesn't complain.
