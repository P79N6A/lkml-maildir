Theoretically, you are never supposed to share your index if you work in
fully git environment. However, I offer some "base tarballs" which have
the unpacked source as well as the .git directory, and I think you want
the index there. Of course you can always regenerate it by
	read-tree $(tree-id)
but I really don't want to (hey, dwmw got away with that too! ;-). It
forces an additional out-of-order step you need to do before making use
of your git for the first time.
The NFS argument obviously seems perfectly valid to me too.  So, FWIW,
I'm personally all for it, if someone gives me a patch.
