Ok nice, but.... hotadd_enough_memory() is broken, it does weird things 
with nd->start and nd->end which haven't been assigned even values yet. 
Also, mysterious business with find_e820_area and last_area_end...These 
areas are not in e820...
And why the reserve_bootmem_node()? Areas not RAM (per e820) are 
reserved anyways.
