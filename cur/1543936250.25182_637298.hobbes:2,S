Golly, you don't think so? Just commenting on his local hack. Port 0x84 is 
inside the (reserved) DMA page register range and stands a better chance of 
not being echoed onto ISA by various chipsets than 0xed does due to that.
Yes -- on a sane machine it's all useless anyway and with all sane machines 
this discussion would've ended quite some time ago already. It's the insane, 
obsolete legacy junk that's the problem.
