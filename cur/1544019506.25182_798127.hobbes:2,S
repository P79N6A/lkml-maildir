If model_id weren't there, the older ieee1394/sbp2 driver would log
model_id 0 (and match against quirks list entries with ID 0), while
firewire-sbp2 logs model_id 0xff000000 (which is an impossible value and
thus indicates to those who want to write a new quirks list entry that
there is actually no model_id...).  I will soon push the patch which
makes sbp2 behave like firewire-sbp2 in this regard, to eliminate a
potential source of conflicting user reports.
