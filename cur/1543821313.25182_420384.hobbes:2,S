I was actually planning on a 5msec timeout to ignore that computer,
for now, then if I don't get a response within 100msec,  ping them,
and permenantly remove them from the list of peers and broadcast a
"this peer is dead" message to the network if the ping times out at
500msec.

The code on the remote end is checking a list of locks to see if a
block is in it.
