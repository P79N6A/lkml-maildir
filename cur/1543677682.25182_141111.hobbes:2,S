Hi,
I'm having some problems with 2.5.71 (latest bk yesterday I believe).
All works well (pcmcia works as advertised, with one tiny blip on
the horizon), except when I want to reboot, when I get the following
message:
unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth1 to become free. Usage count = 1
The net device is an Orinoco mini-pci card (eg, cardbus minipci interface 
with built-in orinoco card), and it is down.
I'm not sure what causes this, and it's started somewhere in 2.5.70 bk.
Hope this report helps,
Bas Vermeulen
