Exactly. There's no hierarchy in this interconnect. So it seemed
that having a static rio_bus device made the most sense. Everything
exists as peers since it works more like a network than a hierarchical
bus like PCI. Right now, you can't see the endpoint which actually
implements your port into the switch fabric...there's no device
created for it. I'm still trying to determine if that should change
but it's not critical to usability with the current generation
hardware.
One argument I have _for_ it is that it would be easy to show
and manipulate a network from userspace if all nodes had a device
associated with them.  That's not a real world problem yet so
I decided not to complicate things yet.

Ok. I did pull this part right from the platform code, in fact.
