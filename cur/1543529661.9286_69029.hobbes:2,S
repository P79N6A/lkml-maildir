That's not 100% true: you can leave out all frame buffer devices and insmod a
fbdev later. My Amiga is not PPC, but m68k, but since my modular amifb patch I
can wake up the video with `modprobe amifb'.
Of course this no longer works in 2.3.51 since the take_over_console() was
removed.

Wrong. CONFIG_FB is only allowed if CONFIG_DECSTATION == y. And there's no
support for a fbdev for DECstation yet in the MIPS CVS tree.

There's still a resource magament problem, though.
