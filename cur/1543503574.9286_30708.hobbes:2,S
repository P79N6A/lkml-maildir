Hi,
I would like to enable the  Modem Status Interrupt in the
IER of 16550A UART from the user level.
From the user level I am accessing /dev/ttyS1 and trying to
write to the modem UART. However I could not find any call
to the kernel to write in the IER register.
This will enable me to detect the ring signal when an
incoming ring is there to the modem.
Thanks,
Girish Kale
