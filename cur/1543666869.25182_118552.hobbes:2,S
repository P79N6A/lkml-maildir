Well, it's the "right church, but wrong pew". As soon as anything
closes STDIO_FILENO, **bang** the modem hangs up. NotGood(tm)!
So as long as I just execute the shell which was exec'ed ...
getty...rlogin...bash never called close. However, `ls` on my
machine is `color-ls` when it calls exit(0)... well you get
the idea! I can log in, but can't actually execute anything that
terminates, closing STDIO_FILENO...

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.20 on an i686 machine (797.90 BogoMips).
Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
