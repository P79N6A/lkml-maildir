You are right. In another shell, I ran while true; do : ; done
# cat /proc/interrupts ; sleep 10 ; cat /proc/interrupts

The performance counter appears to be configured to fire when the event 
count for CPU_CLK_UNHALTED reaches 2,400,000,000 (I have a 2.4 GHz CPU) 
i.e. one NMI per second when the CPU is 100% busy. Is that correct?
On a related note, I have a Pentium 3 which counts CPU_CLK_UNHALTED 
cycles even when the CPU is halted. I was told this is a bug, but it 
actually sounds like a a nice feature!
Is there really no way to have the event counter increment with every 
tick (even when the CPU is halted) on a P4?
Regards.
