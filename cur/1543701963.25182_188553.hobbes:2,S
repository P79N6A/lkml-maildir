Hi all,
Just to say happy new year and inform of my last released kernel patch,
its for make linux-compliant the implementation of the Konica Revio
digital cameras.
It works for Revio C2.
PLeas e, if anybody is experiencing problems with Revio c2 cameras just
apply it against the kernel source tree and re-compile.
A ican make more patches for strange devices that use some of the usb
modules.Just contact me , thanks !
NOTE: the patch is in

 and the

/proc/bus/usb/devices .
Best regards.
Lorenzo .
