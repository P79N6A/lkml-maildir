The idea behind this is to have a probing thread for each device that
does the actual work (call probe for the matching drivers) so that
multiple devices can be probed in parallel. The decision to do this can
only be made at the bus level.
Previously, the code made it possible to have a probing thread for each
matching driver for the same device in parallel. I didn't see any
benefit in that, but maybe I'm just dense...
