Yes - go into linux/drivers/net/net_init.c and change
#define MAX_ETH_CARDS 16
to whatever suits your needs.  You may also want to up the limit on the
max number of cards handled per module insertion - e.g. in
drivers/net/ne.c there
is #define MAX_NE_CARDS  4 - increase this too if you have more than
four ISA ne2000 cards.  (The alternative is to insert the module more
than once.) The limit for the 8139 is 8, and the ne2k-pci driver uses a
linked list of cards (since it accepts no options) and hence has no
similar limit.
Paul.
