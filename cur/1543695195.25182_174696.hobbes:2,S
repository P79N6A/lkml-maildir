Please see the notes at the top of:
http://evms.sourceforge.net/patches/2.1.1/kernel/2.6.0-test8/bd_claim.patch
In general, if you want to "mix" users of a device, you'll just need to revert 
that patch. But this isn't the preferred solution. If you're using EVMS, 
ideally you should switch to using EVMS for all your volumes and partitions. 
Getting your root filesystem mounted through EVMS isn't terribly difficult, 
and you can find more details about it at:
