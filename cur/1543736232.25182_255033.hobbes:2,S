Thanks. 
XFree 3.x did not touch BE mode bit and accessed MMIO directly with pointer 
dereference (expecting firmware to put card into BE mode?), while XFree 4.x (if
I understand code properly) does not touch BE bit on primary device
(while it clears it on secondary devices) while expecting hardware to be
in LE mode...
So I'm either confused, or XF3 needs BE_ACCEL set while XF4 needs BE_ACCEL
disabled.  Does anybody actually use matroxfb with XFree server on PPC (or any
other BE machine) at all?
