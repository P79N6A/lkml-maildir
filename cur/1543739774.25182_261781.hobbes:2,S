So you are saying that the stack area that was used by the passed-
parameter (that was never modified) can be destroyed at the whim of
the compiler?
void funct(int param)
{
    printf("%d\n", param);
    compiler_destroy(param);  // Not coded, just done?
}
Some C-compiler expert has to answer that question. If the
answer is true, then you need this patch:

...and if you need this patch, then there is no reason for
the 'helper' functions at all and the code should be rewritten
to get rid of them.

I'm not sure about that. I don't think the 'C' compiler is allowed
to whack at things that were never touched by the code. For instance,
we have "main(int argc, char *argv[], char *env[]);" Normally main()
is only declared to have two arguments, but the environment strings
are really there also. Can the 'C' compiler destroy them? I think
not.
