Some programs - legitimately, I think - scan /proc/self/fd to close
everything.  The question is whether the glibc-private fds should appear
there.  And something like a "close-on-fork" flag might be useful,
though I guess glibc can keep track of its own fds closely enough to not
need something like that.
