LCD is in Spanish, as in German, a foreign term. But still, its D is
carrying the meaning of "display" or its native equivalent. ("Display"
itself is even in common use in Spain, Germany, and many other
countries.) In German, "display" may be translated to "Anzeige",
"Bildschirm", "Display", "Monitor"; and any of "LCD-Anzeige",
"LCD-Bildschirm", "LCD-Display", "LCD-Monitor" would be bad style.
("LCD-Display" would clearly be the worst of all, because one could
argue that a display is just a part of a monitor, thus "LCD monitor" is
arguably less redundant than "LCD display"...)
