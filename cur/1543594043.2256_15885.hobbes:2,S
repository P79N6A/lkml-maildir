This is most likely a bad "rock" (crystal) in the box.  There is a
"built in" drift of about .1445 seconds a day (runs too slow) due to the
fact that 1.193180Mhz can not be divided to 10 ms. but you are way over
this.  
Here is a bit of code to sync your system to the RTC:

Of course, your best bet would be to use the xntpd code to sync to
another system.
