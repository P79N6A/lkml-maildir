Hello,
I am currently developing a tty-Driver which is used for synchronous PPP.
System:
Board		Special Hardware with a Motorola XPC8260 Microcontroller
OS		Elinos V2 with Kernel Version 2.4.3
PPP		pppd and ppp Modules Version 2.4.1
The following Problem occurs:
The ppp_synctty ldisc only calls my ttywrite function in interrupt context. 
But to avoid a race condition I must include a Semaphore in my ttywrite 
function, so I get a Kernel Oops when this Semaphore causes a call to 
schedule().
Is there a way to stop this ppp_synctty ldisc from sending in Interrupt 
Context?
or
Why does this ldisc only write in interrupt context?
Please CC your replay to klaus.herb@ikon-gmbh.de
Thanks!
Klaus Herb
