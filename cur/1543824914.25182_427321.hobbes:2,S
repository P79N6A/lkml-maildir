Redhat and SuSE put /boot/config- files of the same name for different
architectures (i386, i586) in the same file.  If multiple architecture
kernels of the same verion are installed, there is no guarantee that the
/boot/config-`uname -r` is not for, say, i686 instead of i386.  It takes
 rpm -q --qf "%{ARCH}" --whatprovides /boot/config-`uname -r`
complared with
 uname -m
to see if the mismatch occurs.
Debian (Woody), OTOH strips extra names of their kernels, so 3 or 4
different releases of the same upstream kernel version all install with
the same name and report `uname -r` the same.  If multiple of these
kernels and a vanilla kernel are installed, their config files will be
difficult to distinguish.  dpkg can be used (similar to above for rpm)
to test the condition.
 /boot/config-`uname -r`
works reliability only on Mandrake.
