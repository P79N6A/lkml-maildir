Hmm, I guess you don't need to try each combination of  THM[0267].
From pervious experience, we know _THM0._TMP causes problem.
If you fake _TMP for all THM, what could happen?
If you verified _TMP cause issue by fake them in DSDT,  probably,
we need to continue dig Method : UPDT. 
                    Method (UPDT, 0, NotSerialized)

                            Decrement (IGNR)
                        }
                        Else
                        {
                            If (H8DR)
