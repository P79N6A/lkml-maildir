OK, thanks, but I am still confused.  I had to add CONFIG_DUMMY_KEYB=y 
manually (i386), as nowhere could I find an option in menuconfig (and 
find/grep revealed nothing either)...
This now boots with no keyboard warnings, as suggested (after I removed keymap 
etc. from start scripts).  But I still think I done it all wrong?
