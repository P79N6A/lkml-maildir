  The goal of the fork connector is to inform a user space application
that a fork occurs in the kernel. This information (cpu ID, parent PID
and child PID) can be used by several user space applications. It's not
only for accounting. Accounting and fork_connector are two different
things and thus, fork_connector doesn't do the merge of any kinds of
data (and it will never do). 
  One difference with relayfs is the amount of datas that are
transfered. The relayfs is done, like Evgeniy said, for large amount of
datas. So I think that it's not suitable for what we want to achieve
with the fork connector.
I hope this help,
Regards,
Guillaume
