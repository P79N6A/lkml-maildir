This might help you:
I still have a similar problem (ssh hang with other traffic) that i reported
in november on netdev:
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103641051419994&w=2
(this post includes a tcpdump and a discription how to reproduce it)
I did not follow up on that because i did not have the time and
i ran into hardware problems then...
(You can find the 'socket' program i used here:

)
