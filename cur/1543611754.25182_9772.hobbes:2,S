OK, clean out stuff you don't need in /lib/dev-state. Check your
devfsd configuation to see if /lib/dev-state is being repopulated
automatically. If so, grab devfsd-v1.3.20 and use the new RESTORE
directive. This is the correct way to handle persistence. Remove the
boot-script code which populates from /lib/dev-state.

OK, I suspected as much. Good. Thanks for tracking this down.
Attempting to create the same entry twice *should* yield EEXIST on the
second try. The new devfs is strict about this, the old one wasn't.
I consider this issue closed. I'd suggest you contact Mandrake and get
them to upgrade to devfsd-v1.3.20, remove the boot script code and use
the RESTORE directive instead. This requires v1.2 of the devfs core
(found in 2.4.17-pre1).
