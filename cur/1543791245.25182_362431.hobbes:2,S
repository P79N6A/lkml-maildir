Where is updated code?

There is still a race with poll and tx_start.
Better to have tx_start check for space after queuing and have
poll wake_queue when space becomes available.

Some possibilities:
1. Could you support a subset of the existing wireless functions. Then
   all the cool tools like wireless strength stuff would work.
2. Or add a sysfs status files
3. Or a /proc file per device
It makes sense for the driver to give as much information to the user
as possible. Just try and use existing API's first.

One way I use is to keep a separate patch around that adds in the
/proc stuff for when debugging, but not put it in the main kernel.

Also.
* Default name should be "ib%d" so you can handle multiple cards without
  getting an error.
* Why so many symbols exported?
* Ethtool and standard message level support would be cool (but not required).
