Hi Ray,
That's good news. I think we should probably consider putting the patch in
2.6.14 or if not, then definitely 2.6.15.
Andrew, did you pick up the patch or should I resend to someone?
I think the fork latency alone is enough to justify inclusion... 
however, did
you actually see increased aggregate throughput of your database (or at 
least
not a _decreased_ throughput)?

Well thank you very much for breaking the kernel and telling us about it! :)
