That's an interesting concept.  How could this actually be used
to protect a particular resource?  Do all users of that
resource have to claim both the lock and the semaphore before
they may access it?
There are a number of locks (such as pagecache_lock) which in the
great majority of cases are held for a short period, but are 
occasionally held for a long period.  So these locks are not
a performance problem, they are not a scalability problem but
they *are* a worst-case-latency problem.

Yes.
