Ooops! Sorry! I appologise! This was my bad. For Alpha they are __u64 and I 
misguidedly looked at Alpha instead of i386. (darn ctags...) But of course 
on Alpha long is 64-bits so the issue is moot...
So yes, this patch is definitely bogus. (Well it just would make no 
difference whatsoever.)
Best regards,
