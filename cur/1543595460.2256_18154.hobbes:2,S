Ad a): true.
Ad b): if you only make this change then it will be faster or slower
  depending on how many disks you have (because get_gendisk() used
  to be a linear search through a list that has as length the number
  of disk majors); however, my get_gendisk today is
	static inline struct gendisk *
	get_gendisk(kdev_t dev) {
	        return blk_gendisk[MAJOR(dev)];
	}
  hence is faster.
