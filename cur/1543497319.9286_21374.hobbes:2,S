I have modified the radio-aimslab driver to support my
"TerraTec Active Radio ISA Standalone" radio card.
Unfortunately i have no idea how to get it in the menu or xconfig
procedure.
What is the normal procedure for getting the code reviewed and then
maybe move it in the  official kernel?
This is my first try in writing a kernel module and i am pretty sure
that my code is worse. However it works somehow! :)
Bye, Rolf!
