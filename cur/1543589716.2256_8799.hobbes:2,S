But something must have been not working with it for mmaps/shlibs 
(not executables); at least historically.
At least I remember that all hell broke lose when you tried to update
libc by cp'ing a new one to /lib/libc.so in the 1.2 days. cp should create a 
new inode (it uses O_CREAT) so in theory it should be coherent by the inode 
reference; but somehow it didn't use to work and random already running 
programs started to segfault. This was long ago. I wonder if old
GNU cp used O_TRUNC instead of O_CREAT, or was there some other kernel bug 
with mappings (hopefully long since fixed). Anybody remembers?
