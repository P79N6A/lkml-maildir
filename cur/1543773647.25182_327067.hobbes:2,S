kernel/module.c:1259 disagrees with you.
static inline int license_is_gpl_compatible(const char *license)
{
    return (strcmp(license, "GPL") == 0
        || strcmp(license, "GPL v2") == 0
        || strcmp(license, "GPL and additional rights") == 0
        || strcmp(license, "Dual BSD/GPL") == 0
        || strcmp(license, "Dual MPL/GPL") == 0);
