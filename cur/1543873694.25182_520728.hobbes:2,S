ugh. This is beyond ugly! Why dont we just compile two images, one for 
Xen and one for native, do two passes to get those two images and 
'merge' them into a single vmlinuz (so that we still have a 'single' 
kernel unit to deal with on the distro side). This way we avoid all this 
crazy, limited, fragile patchery business...
