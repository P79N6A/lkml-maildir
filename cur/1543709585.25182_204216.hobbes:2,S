Maybe I'm stupid, but why cannot knfsd module create fs/nfsd
directory at module load? That way you can do insmod/modprobe followed 
by mount() to do that. And if you'll fiddle with do_mount a bit
(so that get_fs_type() is invoked before walking mount path)
you can do it even without modprobing knfsd in advance, by just
doing 'mount none /proc/fs/nfsd -t nfsd'.
