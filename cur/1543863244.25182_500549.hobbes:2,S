Hi!
I'm  not shure but perhaps it isn't an XFS Bug.
Here is what i find out:
We've about 300 servers at the momentan and 5 of them are "old" Intel 
Pentium 4 Machines with a DFI PM-12 Mainboard with VIA chipset. It only 
happens on THESE Machines. Other P4 Machines with a Tyan Mainboard or a 
Gigabyte Mainboard are not affected. All 300 machines runs the same 
Debian 3.0 with self build kernel. Some of these 5 use a 3ware 
controller and some of them the mainboardcontroller. All systems are 
using IDE.
But i cannot say what happens to these machines at the time of failure. 
Sometimes these servers crashed directly after a few minutes. Sometimes 
they run about 2-3 days... i've now downgraded all servers to 2.6.16.37. 
Cause they are production machines... but i have one machine where we 
can test - if you need something.
Here is the output running 2.6.16.37 at the moment:
xfs_growfs -n /
meta-data=/dev/root              isize=256    agcount=16, agsize=603855 blks
