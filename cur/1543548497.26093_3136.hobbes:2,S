I have done the port of cs46xx.c from kernel 2.2 to 2.4 so I feel a bit
responsible for this.
In order to help you out could you please send me a lspci dump along with
a "lspci -n" dump (so I get the names and numbers).

Yes!
Some of us are having the problem that the cs4280 (which is your card?)
sometimes freezes the machine. I am hunting this bug for quite a while now.
Also I am interested in 2.4 testers for probably new versions of the driver and
different setups to verify my patches before I send them to Alan and Linus.
So I welcome your offer and will send you updated versions of the driver, OK?
Any other beta test takers ;) ?
Thanks!
