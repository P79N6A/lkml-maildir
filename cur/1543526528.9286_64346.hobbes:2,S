Since till such deamon is designed it's not clear which information is
needed by such daemon. For example it can be usefull to notify owner of
process which tries to use floppy. To do so you SHOULD know such owner
and it's not possible to do from userspace.

Kernel glue is ANSOLUTELY useless without userland interface. Thus such
glue MUST be developed with userland interface.

Exactly. That's why THE whole scheme should be designed (complete with
userland daemon) BEFORE talks about submitting changes to Linus can be
started. Otherwise the same thing will happen as with LinuxThreads.
Clone allowed the beast to be created. Just like you proposed no one tried
to actually write userspace part early. So now we ALMOST have "proper"
implementation (not 100% ready BTW). THREE YEARS after interface was folded
in kernel ? Why ? Since three years ago noone bothered to write userspace part
and find out that you'll need few small additions to kernel to do things
"right way". Additions not exactly obvious when userspace was not implemented.
Not a way to go IMNSHO.
