Ok, so to add DRM to GPLed software, the copyright holder has to state
that the DMCA does not apply to such software? Or does the GPL state
that? 
Quoting the GPL:
6.- [...] You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'

The point is that it is not the copyright holder who is imposing the
restrictions, is the law. For example, the law may impose some export
restrictions, would that void the GPL?

They are only a claiming, not restricting. The restriction would come
from the law when a judge decides that the code in question is an
"effective technological measure".

Ok, I mean a user who tries to exercise all the rights stated in the
GPL, including distribution of the modified code.
