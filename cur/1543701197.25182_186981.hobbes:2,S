Subject: [PATCH] text backport of fix for tmpfs oops from 2.6.0 final to 2.4.23
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Stupid free mail program appears to have converted
my message into a octet stream, this should work
even if it is kind of strange. Travel without a good
connection is painful, Hopefully this is readable.
Ok, here is a backport of the patch that went into 2.6.0
to fix the problem where the tmpfs/shmfs dcache could be
oopsed by any user doing a dirseek to offset 2.
This occurs because the when the seek is at the cursor
and then the cursor is deleted, the list_add_tail
tries to attach to the end of the list and gets the
old pointers (poisoned on 2.6) from the list_del.
This fix just deletes the cursor before going over the
list since it can not be a member of the list and should
not be counted, delete it before counting over the list.
