Sorry to followup to myself, but I just had another thought--if you
can split your task up into multiple processe such that no process
needs to address more than 4GB, an IA32 machine will work fine.  It
will probably still take more programming work than the naive approach
(malloc() huge chink, use it) that you could use on a 64-bit
machine...
