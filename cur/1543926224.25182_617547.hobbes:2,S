Hello,
With 2.6.23 kernel, the laptop middle button worked fine. With
2.6.24-rc1, when I press the middle button, the cursor jumps around
the screen and this appears in the kernel log (for each time I press
the button):
psmouse.c: GlidePoint at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost sync at byte 1
psmouse.c: GlidePoint at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost sync at byte 1
psmouse.c: GlidePoint at isa0060/serio1/input0 - driver resynched.
Related dmesg:
input: Macintosh mouse button emulation as /class/input/input0
PNP: PS/2 Controller [PNP0303:KBC0,PNP0f13:MSE0] at 0x60,0x64 irq 1,12
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
input: PS/2 Mouse as /class/input/input2
input: AlpsPS/2 ALPS GlidePoint as /class/input/input3
Earlier dmesgs (2.6.23) had (only) this:
input: Macintosh mouse button emulation as /class/input/input0
PNP: PS/2 Controller [PNP0303:KBC0,PNP0f13:MSE0] at 0x60,0x64 irq 1,12
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse as /class/input/input2
It seems that the driver used is different. What can I do to fix this?
Kind regards,
Vegard Nossum
