But it's a very interesting idea: instead of performing readahead in 
generic_file_read the user thread would calculate the readahead window
information and pass it off to a kernel thread dedicated to readahead.
This thread can make an informed, global decision on how much IO to
submit.  The user thread benefits by avoiding some stalls due to
readahead->readpage, as well as avoiding thrashing due to excessive
readahead.
