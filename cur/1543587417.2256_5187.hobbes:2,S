I missed that patch and have been unable to find it on google/dejanews.
However, my point is to provide an exhaustive list with sizes (and the tool
for generating it), to make it easier to spot and prioritize ones that
may have been missed.
Anyhow, thanks for the tip.  Perhaps I should run this program and
post results again on a subsequent kernel release (presumably
with Andrey's patch), although anyone else can run this program
just as easily.
