They are just a menu that can be switched on or off.
It is for those people that start with an arbitrary .config and
work their way through menuconfig to disable all the parts they
do not want. So, point no. 1:
  * Disabling this menu disables all the fluff inside it,
    without needing to enter the menu and disable each
    option one by one (as was the case previously)
Then of course, one can also turn these menuconfig on (apparently!)
to be able to descend into them and select some drivers they like.
Point no. 2:
  * Since Jens Axboe's stance ["default y idiocy"] is to have
    these menus disabled by default, people should most likely
    enable them first before they will be able to enter them.
    (I would have wanted them to be always 'y' - it does not affect
    the build, just opens all menus by default)

menuconfig NETDEV_10000
	bool "Ethernet (10GbE)"
	---help--
	Say Y here to actually be able to go into this menu
	and select some drivers that we think belong to the
	"10 Gigabit Ethernet" family.
	If unsure, it is unwise to say N!
See, this looks so fundamentally basic to me that I find it
almost funny. YMMV, hence I asked for suggestions from
other people.

menuconfigs are some special kind in that they combine an option
with a menu. Perhaps now that some ->menuconfig patches have gone
in, more people will get to know these constructs.
