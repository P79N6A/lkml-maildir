You cannot fulfill that in reality. Looking at the broad variety of software
out there you simply cannot know all the implications a simple bug fix may
have. There may well be boxes that rely on a broken code you just fixed. Only
god knows. So you sometimes simply have to do "the right thing"(tm) knowing
there will always be people who shoot you for it.
