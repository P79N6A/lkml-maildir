Getting new and interesting feedback is good.  You can tell something

I will look, at that.

This would require effort to little purpose.  If you just call kexec
it loads the kernel and then calls shutdown -r now.  So the loaded kernel
should be a transient entity anyway.

Ideally drivers should be able to cope with this.

Ah, the easy case kexec loading the same kernel that had the kexec support....
