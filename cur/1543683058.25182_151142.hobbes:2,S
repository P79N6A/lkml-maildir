ok, this one i *am* going to take a stand on -- you're making no
sense whatsoever, so just put down the keyboard and step back.
all of the above three suggestions are for the purpose of either
simplifying the current menu structure or making it more consistent
with the way the rest of the menus are presented.  none of them
increase the complexity of *anything*.
how the heck can you refer to "A lot of these" in the context
of three suggestions?  get a grip, dude.
and as the complete rookie who took it upon himself to learn
the Kconfig structure so i could bring some order to the filesystems
menu, well, frankly, i *like* that structure, and i haven't heard
any complaints.  you seriously think the original structure was
*clearer*?
since i don't have the ability to actually hack down at the code
level, i figured i could still contribute by making it easier for
newbies like myself with simpler and more consistent menus.
apparently, this might not be worth the effort after all.
thanks ever so much for the encouragement.
