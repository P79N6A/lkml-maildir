	Nobody knows, that's definitely part of the problem. If you 
genuinely want to make a good faith effort to comply with the GPL, 
I'm not sure what you can do other than guess.

	The problem then occurs with companies like RedHat. They distribute 
binaries, so they must distribute the source in the preferred form 
for making modifications to it. *If* metainformation in Linus' BK 
tree is part of the preferred version of the work for the purposes of 
making modifications to it, then RedHat *cannot* comply with the GPL.
	Checking source code out of a repository is an obfuscatory act that 
separates the raw source code from the rationale for that source 
code. It's equivalent to stripping comments. The GPL does not allow 
you to obfuscate the source, so if all *you* have is obfuscated 
source, *you* cannot ship binaries.
	I don't think this is currently an issue for the Linux kernel. 
However, it may well be an issue for projects using things like 
sourceforge or using proprietary file formats to hold portions of 
their source.
