You cannot have an arbitrary fs. The two fs drivers must coordinate with
each other in order for your scheme to work. Just think about if the two 
fs drivers work on the same file simultaneously and both start growing the
file at the same time. All hell would break lose.
For your scheme to work, the fs drivers need to communicate with each
other in order to attain atomicity of cluster and inode (de-)allocations,
etc.
Basically you need a clustered fs for this to work. GFS springs to
mind but I never really looked at it...
