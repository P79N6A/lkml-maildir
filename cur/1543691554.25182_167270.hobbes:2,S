Could you please explain why you cant build on top of oprofile? If arch
specific profilers start going in, we are going to have 5 different ways
of doing the same thing.
We really need to work together on this. We for example have a bunch of
ppc64 profiling stuff but throwing that into the kernel to create yet
another profiler is not the answer.
