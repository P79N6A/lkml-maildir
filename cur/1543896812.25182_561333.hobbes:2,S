The problem with removing uses of the BKL is that a "lock_kernel()"
gives no clue about what it is protecting against, and so it requires
a lot of very difficult auditing to replace with appropriate locking.
To take a couple of examples at random: fs/ext4/ioctl.c takes the BKL
in ext4_compat_ioctl() around the call to ext4_ioctl().  Kind of sad
that a "next-generation" FS still uses the BKL, but who understands
things well enough to say how all the cases in ext4_ioctl() are
relying on being called with the BKL held?
As a second example, msr_seek() in arch/i386/kernel/msr.c... is the
inode semaphore enough or not?  Who understands the implications well
enough to say?
Most semaphores on the other hand can be replaced by mutexes or
completions in a fairly straightforward way.
