Sigh. I did a 'make allmodconfig' on x86_64 and found to my suprise only
a sinlge symbol being exported more than one time.
This is purely a consistency check introduced by commit:

I can rip it out again if the noise/value ratio is too high.

We should IMO try to keep the exports in generic code.
The exports should go with the function definition - right after closing
'{'.
All other ways of exporting function is a call for inconsistency.
A gret deal of effort has been put into getting rid of ksym files
- good. But exports should not be scattered far away form the function
definition.

Placing the export just below the function definition should cover this
in 90% of the cases. The rest is macros..

Agreed.
