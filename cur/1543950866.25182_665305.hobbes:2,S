Aha.  This is indeed where the problem was.  A line in the modprobe
config files was supposed to cause dcdbas to load, but was instead
causing modprobe to call itself repeatedly for dcdbas.  I don't know why
an incorrect line was there, but removing it from the config allows
dcdbas to load without problem manually, and the autoload patch loads it
automatically.
Sincere apologies to everyone for causing the fire drill on a false
alarm.  Since fixing my config makes things work again, and nobody else
sees the problem, the autoload patch should stay.
Thanks for the help tracking down the issue.
Frank (off to hide in the corner)
