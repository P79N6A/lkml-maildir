Yes; or even longer.  80 characters might have made sense on a screen
when the alternative was 80 characters on a punched card, but on a
modern computer it's very restrictive.  That's especially true with the
deep indents that you quickly get in C.  Even short lines often need to
be split when you put a few tabs in front of them, and that makes
comprehension that bit harder, not to mention looks ugly.
