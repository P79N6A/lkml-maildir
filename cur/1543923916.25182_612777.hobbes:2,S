I messed up with my previous set of driver core fixes and sent a patch
that removed some functions that the ia64 arch still uses.
I've now reverted that patch, sorry about that.
Thanks to Tony Luck for pointing out my mistake.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
thanks,
