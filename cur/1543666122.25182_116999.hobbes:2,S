That is quite possible. Maybe someone could compile a list of programs
that still use read/write to /dev/sg*?
I had at some point planned to allow arbitrary block device -> /dev/sg*
mapping, maybe it would be a good idea to finish that thought. Then you
wouldn't have to rely on programs using SG_IO ioctl, which does seem
like a bad idea.
