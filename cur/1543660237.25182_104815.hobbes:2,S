Hi
I am currently testing a device driver on linux-2.4.19. This is
implemented as a loadable kernel module.
# Could anyone suggest a good debugger that can be used to debug kernel
  modules?
# When I tried using gdb with vmlinux and /proc/kcore, I am getting a
  message saying that no debug symbols are found. How do I enable debug
  symbols for linux kernel image? Kernel Debug is already enabled. Is
  there some other configuration that needs to be there?
Thanks in advance.
regards
Madhavi.
