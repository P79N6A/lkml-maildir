Actually no. See if we had a pile of documentation and no code nobody would
be running anything

Docs are important. Very important. There are now some passable books on the
Linux kernel although the rather nice device driver writing book is still
due its much needed update.
BTW, if you look at 2.3.45 and friends you'll notice one or two files now
using gdoc so that you can generate function references directly from the
drivers.
