In todays world, SMP is becoming more and more common (still waiting to
get that DualCore cell phone).  So that means that writing to a variable
is going to carry more weight than it use to, and gcc needs to take note
of this.  So, to avoid a short condition jump by adding a write to
memory, is not going to save anying.
Maybe gcc just needs to have an option to "optimize" for SMP.
