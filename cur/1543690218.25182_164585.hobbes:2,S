What about suspend-to-ram, APM, and runtime states? 
That actually makes it quite a bit more complicated, globally. By forcing 
the policy down to the drivers, you force each one to interpret the value 
themselves and make the decision. By doing it centrally, the only thing 
the low-level drivers have to worry about is going into the state.
