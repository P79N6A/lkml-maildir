My first suspicion was that it was just overflowing, but not getting 
the message out.  I just realized that my latest testing (the last 24 
hours) was on the original patch, not the updated one that you posted 
later, which included the stack checking.  I'm sure that I was having 
the same problem with the overflow checking enabled and _not_ getting 
any errors from it, but I'll redo the testing for my sanity's sake.
