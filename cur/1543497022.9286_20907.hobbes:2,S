Hi, I am writing a device driver, and I need to read a byte on the board,
however I do not care about the value of the byte (it just clears the
interrupt). I looked around a bit and didn't see any appropriate macros
or info in the linux-kernel archives. (working in 2.2.6)
Whats the easiest way to avoid having the read optimized away? I am
fairly fluent in C, but compiler optimizations are bit too much black 
magic for me.
If you could mail me at eww@iag.net, I would be very grateful, I 
read kernel-traffic, but not the list directly.
