You would need one page per cpu and to check a change in a TIF_
bitflag during switch_to (zero cost) and overwrite the vsyscall bit in
the slow path.
If we had a picotimeofday that would be guaranteed monotone... if he
can measure errors with shared memory in smp, it means the measurement
error (LAPIC and tsc frequency estimation) is longer than the time it
takes to bounce a spinlock and reach a second rdtscp. I hoped this
wouldn't happen. Could you send me the app used to reproduce the
non-monotonicity over shared memory with rdtscp? I finally have a (EE)
stepping F to attempt testing it. thanks!
