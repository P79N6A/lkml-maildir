I really wasn't asking that you should, just mumbling and hoping that 
some VM-savvy person would say "I can do that!" and offer an elegant 
solution. Given how little more cache helps for most loads on a machine 
with adequate memory, it seems silly to have almost all the programs on 
a 2GB machine pushed out to make room for pages read exactly once by a 
program copying a 4GB file.
