Hello,
I am having nasty problems with an Adaptec 29160 and Promise
Ultratrak100 TX8 external RAID. (kernel 2.6.11)
Initially, I can access the RAID normally. I create a (small, for
testing) partition on it, and an ext3 filesystem. But when I start
writing, in no-time the RAID and the SCSI adapter get into a broken
state, and rebooting both RAID and Linux (simply rmmod/modprobe is not
enough) is the only way out.
I trigger this with a small test like creating 10000 files, or
extracting a kernel tar.gz.
In my /var/log/messages I find:
Mar  8 10:58:22 iua-file-2 kernel: (scsi3:A:0:0): data overrun detected in Data-out phase.  Tag == 0x2.
Mar  8 10:58:22 iua-file-2 kernel: (scsi3:A:0:0): Have seen Data Phase.  Length = 524288.  NumSGs = 33.
Mar  8 10:58:52 iua-file-2 kernel: scsi3:0:0:0: Attempting to queue an ABORT message

Mar  8 10:58:52 iua-file-2 kernel: scsi3: At time of recovery, card was not paused
Mar  8 10:58:52 iua-file-2 kernel: >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Dump Card State Begins <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Mar  8 10:58:52 iua-file-2 kernel: scsi3: Dumping Card State in Data-out phase,
at SEQADDR 0x17b
Mar  8 10:58:52 iua-file-2 kernel: Card was paused
I have tried changing settings in the adaptec controller BIOS, I tried
lowering the global_tag_depth, all to no avail. And having the reboot
everytime it goes wrong makes trying things rather slow :-(
I googled for the messages, and found many people mentioning them, but
no solution.
I'd very much appreciate your help. Please Cc: me when replying, because
I am not subscribed to the lkml.
Kind regards,
Maarten
