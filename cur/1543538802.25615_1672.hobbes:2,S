Folks,
I've been lurking here for a while, trying to follow what's happening. I 
built and am successfully running kernel 2.3.99-pre6 on my AMD K3-400/ALI 
mb/EIDE based system, but have so far failed to run 2.4.0. Although I can 
build it, when it boots it tries to do a network boot -- using BOOTP. As 
I've no other machine around, that fails. I've done the usual lilo stuff. 
The software is mostly RH6.2 vintage, but before that I tried mandrake 6.5 
and some parts of that are left.
I thought of using devfs, thinking maybe device numbers were wrong, but 
even if they were can't think of a way to create a boot node which uses it.
Can anyone help?
Ruth
