Thanks. That's what I wanted to know.

The config option is a little bit mislabeled. More clear would be:
"Support disks attached to a FastTrak controller if the controller is 
denying their existence"
And as help text:
"Promise FastTrak controllers tend to deny the existence of attached 
disks by claiming to have disabled the IDE ports because they want you 
to use the binary only driver. However, the kernel can ignore this trick 
and access the IDE disks just fine if you set this option to Y.
Say Y unless you want to use the slow binary only driver from Promise"
Was this text clear enough? If so, I might submit this as new help text ;-)
