Hi,
Since I don't know anything about the i386 architecture internals and even
less about recent 2.3.* changes, here's some questions for all you smart
people out there:
I've heard recently that 2.3.* does not use a GDT entry per process, but
rather per processor.  Does this mean that there is only one kernel-space
stack per processor as well?  (From what I've heard about the i386,
priveleged code runs on a different stack, right?  I'm making a lot of
guesses here, so sorry if I'm being confusing.)
So what resources does a kernel still allocate per process on an i386
(besides just a generic page to hold the task struct)?  Did the 4090 task
limit for x86 go away?
Just curious,
Chris Smith <cd_smith@ou.edu>
