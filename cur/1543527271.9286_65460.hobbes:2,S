Okay. I goofed. I saw the "%" and thought it was "#". My non-root
guys print "$" for the basic prompt. Other answers in this thread
seem to show that the directory is not re-read for 'pwd' since
the current directory is already known.
I don't know if this is the correct behavior. Checks with my Sun
show that it is certainly different.
