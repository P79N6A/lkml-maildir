This setup forbids future addons to file_flags
In three years, when we want to add a new indirect feature to socket() 
call, do we need a new indirect2() syscall ?
So I suggest using :
   union indirect_params i = {
      .file_flags.flags = O_CLOEXEC,
   };
fd = syscall (__NR_indirect, &r, &i, sizeof (i));
Or better, you could avoid using 'union indirect_params' in user code, and 
only use the substructs for each function.
/* define this in some include file of course */
  struct file_flags {
	int flags;
  };
/* use it */
struct file_flags ff = { .flags = O_CLOEXEC};
fd = syscall (__NR_indirect, &r, &ff, sizeof(ff));
This to avoid to copy to kernel un-necessary data, and permitting futures changes.
