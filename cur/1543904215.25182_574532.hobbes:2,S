Neither were research topics, but I'm tired of correcting the history
of my failures. I've got enough ongoing failures as things stand.

There was never any research involved in the page clustering per se.
It was supposed to be a generally advantageous thing that Linus had
at least once explicitly approved of that just so happened to relieve
mem_map[] pressure on 64GB i386, the side effect intended to attract
corporate patronage.
That last fact was not only demonstrable, it was used in the first
ever public demonstration of a 64GB i386 machine running Linux, which
I personally carried out.
Beyond active hindrances and lacks of cooperation, a "competing
solution" with distro backing appeared that removed the last vestige
of corporate patronage from the project. It ended up bitrotting
faster than I could singlehandedly do all the maintenance, testing,
and coding work on it while also trying to get anything else done.
MPSS was not as well-developed at the time the hugetlb "solution"
killed it, but is not terribly dissimilar in how it came into
being, developed, and then died, apart from less active hindrance.
The one and only aspect in which any research was involved was a
proposal, never accepted or pursued, to investigate how larger
base page sizes implemented via page clustering mitigated external
fragmentation for the purposes of MPSS and also how certain
techniques borrowed from page clustering could reduce the frequency
of and performance penalties associated with demotion in MPSS. The
proposal has never been publicly circulated, though some of its content
was described in the KS presentation as "future directions" or similar.

This is all valid commentary, though I don't have any particular
response to it.
In any event, I've never been involved in a research project, though
I would've liked to have been. The emphasis in all cases was enabling
specific functionality in production, using techniques whose viability
had furthermore already been demonstrated elsewhere, by others.
In both instances, insurmountable nontechnical obstacles were present,
which remain in place and effectively limit the scale and scope of any
sort of project I can personally lead with any sort of likelihood of
mainline acceptance.
Where I am limited, you are not. Good luck to you.
