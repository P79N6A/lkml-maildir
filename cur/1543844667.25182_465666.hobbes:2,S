Well I think there is 3 bug total exposed my unique situation. I think
all 3 issues are generic mainline bugs that have been around for
awhile.   
1. SRAT not being mapped (patch submitted to fix boot_ioremap code)
  This caused cpus to fail to be borough on line and panicked the box. 
2.  The panic is bad.  I have so far tested the patch David
submitted....  It allowed the cpu_up calls to fail without panicking the
box.  Andrew do you want me to test yours or ???
3. Flat mode i386 numa on a real numa system is broken.  If there is
only 1 node in the system cpus should think they are apart of some other
node.     Patch below.  
  If cases where a real numa system boots the Flat numa option make sure
the cpus don't claim to be apart on a non-existent node.
