Confirmed.

And i think my clock chip is drifting, it's actually the 6th of November. =)
Anyways...... Spent 15 minutes trying to figure out why it couldn't read the
tape, and kept giving me the errors.  Then i remembered the whole point of
this bug-report WAS about it not reading tapes.  It's Monday morning, but my
brain is still out there in the wild blue yonder. :)
I'm interested in why the HP drive won't read tapes, but if i swap in my
Seagate, it reads them just fine.  Well, aside from media errors.  Seems HP
can't build a tape drive OR tape media that is reliable =)
