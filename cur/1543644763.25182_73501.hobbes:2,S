Have you tried running without X and using the serial port for other
things, like ppp? The assumption is that this is a mouse issue, and I
haven't run 2.5.38 long enough to swear that it isn't, but it might also
be a serial issue. I would venture a guess that the major developers don't
use serial much for anything.

Or booting with "noapic" if you don't already. Consider that a data point,
not a solution, I wish I wasn't running all my systems that way. Clearly
the performance impact of noapic is minimal, it just bugs me that after
all the work to balance the irq load many systems are not stable using
that feature.
