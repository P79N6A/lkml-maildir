Still no responses... (even telling me to go away.)
2.2.0-pre[1-9] breaks libc-5.4.46 compiles
When compiling the kernel...
mm.h            includes sched.h
sched.h         includes binfmts.h
binfmts.h       includes fs.h
#if defined __KERNEL__
      fs.h          includes affs_fs_i.h
      affs_fs_i.h   includes time.h
      time.h        defines struct timeval
   and...
sched.h         includes timex.h      /* Starting with 2.2.0-pre1 */
timex.h         uses struct timeval   /* OK because in the kernel */
                                      /* time.h was included */
so everything is fine...
When compiling libc-5.4.46...
__fpathconf.c   includes sched.h
sched.h         includes binfmts.h
binfmts.h       includes fs.h
   and...
sched.h         includes timex.h      /* Starting with 2.2.0-pre1 */
timex.h         uses struct timeval   /* Not OK because in libc */
                                      /* time.h is not included */
Basically timex.h will not compile unless time.h has already
been included.
Should the kernel headers be idempotent?
i.e. should I be able to write
========================= xxq.c begin
#include <linux/some-arbitrary-header.h>
========================= xxq.c end
and compile it?
