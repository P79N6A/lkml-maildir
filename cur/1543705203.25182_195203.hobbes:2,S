Well, there is a PCI to wishbone bridge:
http://www.opencores.org/projects/pci/
and a DDR memory controller:
http://www.opencores.org/projects/ddr_sdr/
but do we really need DDR RAM?  For the small amount of RAM on the
card, (8 or 16 MB at the most), surely the cost of standard static ram
ICs wouldn't be too off-putting, and it would presumably simplify the
design slightly.
(It's you that's got to build it, though, so it's your call :-) ).
John.
