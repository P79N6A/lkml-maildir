Hi!
I tried the patch with an Asus P5A-B + AMD K6-II 333, the
ALi 1541 and it works very well. With the patches from the
irc channel #nvidia for ali-agp it was working but only in
1x agp mode, SBA and FW disabled. With this patch now I can
run 2x agp mode and don't crash my system when playing 3D
like terminus or descent3.
Best wishes
Norbert
