ok.
so it seems the code itself is correct. it's just a little bit odd
to read over the code, returning an unsigned int, and then find
no comments on this "not so common usage" ;)
nevertheless, functions which just check for != NULL for the return
type needs fixing. - plus s hort comment containing your explaination
above could help other people ...
