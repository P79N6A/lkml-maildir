Hi all,
I am having some serious problems with the serial driver in 2.4.20 kenrnel
(from Debian) compiled with GCC 2.95.4
My server is a dual PPro with ECC memory. It has never crashed until
I started using the serial port for the modem. During a connection,
it suddenly froze with no keyboard response at all and _nothing_
on the screen. I thought maybe something overheated or what not.
Two days later, I tried using the modem once more. After about
30 minutes and 1.5M later, there was a hard crash once more.
I never experienced that with a non-SMP machine. And I never
used SMP with serial driver...
serial is compiled as module.
Any ideas?
- Adam
