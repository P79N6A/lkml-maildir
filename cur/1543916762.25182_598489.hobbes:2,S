What I meant by protecting 'code' was the 'code' itself.  Those pages
containing instructions that cpu executes.  It of course can't protect
against all the things they do.

It should.  After ->exit() is called, there can't be any object left
behind.  If a module is hosting objects which can't be destroyed from
->exit(), its module ref count shouldn't be zero.  So, either 1.
refcount != 0 or 2. ->exit() can destroy all objects.  As Cornelia
explains, for ccwgroup, it's #1.  Note that unload inhibition doesn't
change anything about this.

No, it doesn't change that at all.  All unload inhibition does is
postponing removal of code (and data too of course) section a bit so
that a module can host code which issues unloading of itself.  Object
synchronization rules remain exactly the same.  Formerly broken code is
still broken and I don't even think unload inhibition would mask them
too much either.
I think the naming is too ambiguous.  Maybe it should be named something
like "hold_module_for_suicide".
Thanks.
