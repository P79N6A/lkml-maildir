I don't see much problems with it... it is cache and it can be pruned if needed.
Some time ago, for example, my patch introducing the same list for inodes
was commited.

I don't know global LRU implementation based on per-sb lists, do you?
If someone suggest the algorithm for more or less fair global LRU
based on non-global list we will implement it. However, so far,
AFAICS there were problems with it.
Thanks,
