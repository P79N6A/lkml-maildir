Other thing I wonder about - less efficient page table placement
on NUMA systems might harm TLB miss latency on some systems
(although we don't always do a great job of trying to localise these
things yet anyway). Another is possible increased lock contention on
widely shared page tables like libc.
I agree that it is not something which needs to be rushed in any
time soon. We've already got significant concessions and complexity
in the memory manager for databases (hugepages, direct io / raw io)
so a few % improvement on database performance doesn't put it on our
must have list IMO.
