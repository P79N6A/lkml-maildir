So does the keyboard events generate something like this then:
KEY_x_DOWN
KEY_x_REPEAT
KEY_x_UP
If so then X certainly could get all the keyboard information I imagine
it needs from the kernel, but otherwise I am not sure how it could.  A
repeated series of key down events are not enough since some keys you
don't want repeated you just want to know when the key is held down and
when it isn't.
I just hope someone figures it out since I would love to stop getting
duplicate characters whenever the system is under a bit of load in X.
