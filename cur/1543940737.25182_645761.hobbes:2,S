Subject: [GIT PULL] KVM updates for the 2.6.25 merge window
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus,
Please pull the kvm updates for 2.6.25 from the repo and branch at:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/avi/kvm.git for-linus
Changes include performance and scalability improvements, completion
of the portability work (though no new architectures are supported
with this submission), support for new hardware features, using
general userspace memory for kvm (which enables swapping guest memory
as well as sharing memory among guests), as well as the usual
cleanups and incremental fixes.
