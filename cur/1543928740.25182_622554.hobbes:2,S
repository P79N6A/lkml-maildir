No, it would be more like a desktop/workstation thingy which protects 
against different kinds of malware and can also enforce policies, all 
centraly managed. I am afraid to use to more marketing words not to upset 
the LKML filters because originaly my posdt was blocked on.. hah! I almost 
wrote it now! :) It was "security vendor" but with another term for 
vendor.

I completely agree and effort to do that is under way. I am not the one 
coordinating that but hopefully those who are will post something soon.

Personally I don't know. I am often surprised when I hear what techniques 
the bad guys use and what is possible.
Solution that we currently have is not so slow (btw you are free to try it 
out). And by working on a proper interface race and reliability issues 
should be solvable.

That is fine for some classes of servers. But for some other and desktop 
more could be needed.
