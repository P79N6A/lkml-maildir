So that the compiler can verify that our declarations of sys_epoll_foo()
match our definitions of them.

Sure.  But if epoll.c _does_ use something from mm.h (or uses something
from a header which mm.h includes) then if we later remove the #include
mm.h from sched.h, eventpoll.c will break.
The general rule is: include in .c the header files which provide the stuff
which that .c file uses.  Now, it maybe that eventpoll.c indeed uses nothing
which mm.h provides, and nothing which mm.h's includees provide.  But it is
non-trivial to prove that.  Once added, includes are hard to remove :(
