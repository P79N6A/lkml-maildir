Actually, I've had tripwire detect more *accidental* changes due to buggy
software than I have had it detect actual hacking.  Oh, and it's good at
catching unintended config changes - I started using tripwire after I
fat-fingered a script, and the machine backed up to /dev/null instead of
/dev/rmt0.
In fact, I've never actually had tripwire detect actual hacking.
