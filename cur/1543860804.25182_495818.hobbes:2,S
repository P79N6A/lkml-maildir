Hi Randy,
I have posted some patches. But there are lots of warnings and I am
still working through the rest. Already posted patches are available
in rc2-mm1.
Any help from respective subsystem maintainers is appreciated. :-)
These problems are already present. CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y just makes
them visible to MODPOST as relocatation information is retained in
vmlinux if CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.
Thanks
Vivek
