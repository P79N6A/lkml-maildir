Well, that's a bit too much ugliness for me, sorry.

I'd rather not get rid of the assembly parts.  Instead, I'd modify them to
handle bitmaps.  I'm not going to drop them.

I think it could be done without that code and I'd prefer to do so.  In fact,
we only need to remember:
(a) saveable pages
(b) pages used to store the data from (a)
(c) pages allocated by us that we should release eventually
(generally that may be a broader set than just (b)).
That's 3 bitmaps total and no need for using any more sophisticated stuff,
if I remember everything correctly.

OK, thanks.
