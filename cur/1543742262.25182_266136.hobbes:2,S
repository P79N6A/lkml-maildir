That's a new one.  Can you tell us more about why people want to do such a
thing?

Patch looks reasonable - we just need to decide whether the requirement
warrants its inclusion.
There have been a few changes in the sysrq code since 2.6.9 and there are
more changes queued up in -mm.  The patch applies OK, but it'll need
checking and redoing.  There's a new `sysrq-f' command in the pipeline
which causes a manual oom-killer call.
