Hello.
I have just got this card.
On the 3 1/2 diskette there is code for the module. these two files:
dm9xs.c  dmfe.c
but the linux kernel 2.4.17 has got dmfe.c only.
The files that came with the card are said to be for 2.4 and 2.2 respectively.
How does the dmfe.c from the latest kernel differs from the ones that come with the card?
and which should I stick with?
Thank you.
