It's a red herring, folks.
The preferred form for *MAKING* modifications is a /usr/src/linux source
tree.  The form that's in  BitKeeper is in the preferred format for *tracking*
and *managing* changes.  Remember - you have to check the source out of
the repository to do the edit/compile/test loop, and then commit it back
when you're done.  So the BK repository isn't where actual development happens,
because gcc and make can't read the repository.
Of course, having written this, some damn fool will prove me wrong by writing
a  'bkfs' file system (similar to the various 'pgfs' front-ends for Postgres)
so you actually *CAN* do a 'make' of the repository :)
