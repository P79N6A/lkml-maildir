Whatever bits you take it's a random move with a limited memory address
space and does not change the picture.
Stack colouring become evident when you have a quite big number of
processes waiting for the same event inside the kernel ( accept, ... )
that means that they're going to walk the same path in their way in/out of
the kernel.
By simplifying the pattern, with the current implementation with your
example 256Kb 4 way associative and 8Kb kernel stack you've ( statistically ):
        W0        W1        W2        W3

By adding three bits of colouring you're going to cut the collision of
about 1/8.
