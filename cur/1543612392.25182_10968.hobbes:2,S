   Huh?  Of course not, they'd use mutexes in a mmap-ed file, which uses
   the hardware's coherency.  No locks in the vfs or fs, that's all done
   in the mmap/page fault path for sure, but once the data is mapped you
   aren't dealing with the file system at all.
We're talking about two things.
Once the data is MMAP'd, sure things are coherent just like on any
other SMP, for the user.
But HOW DID YOU GET THERE?  That is the question you are avoiding.
How do I look up "/etc/passwd" in the filesystem on a ccCluster?
How does OS image 1 see the same "/etc/passwd" as OS image 2?
If you aren't getting rid of this locking, what is the point?
That is what we are trying to talk about.
