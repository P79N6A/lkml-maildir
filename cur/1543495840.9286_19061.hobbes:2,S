  Hi, all. With the advent of 2.3.x, this seems like a timely reminder
to mention my kernel newsflash page:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/docs/kernel-newsflash.html
This page is designed to stop repeat message of the type "blah doesn't
compile in kernel x.y.latest". Please read the newsflash page first
before posting such a message: someone may have already beaten you to
it. If you have the honour of being the first off the blocks, then
send a patch to the kernel list and Cc: it to me for addition to the
page.
If you don't feel confident enough to patch it, send a report to the
kernel list, and still Cc: me so I can notice and grab the response.
But try to patch it anyway: it's easier than you think, and you'll
feel empowered!
In addition, I've started a companion page to my "porting to 2.2"
page. The new page tells you how to port drivers from 2.2 to 2.3.
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/docs/porting-to-2.3.html
As always, these pages are referenced in the kernel-list FAQ,
mentioned at the bottom of each message on the list (see below).
				Regards,
					Richard....
