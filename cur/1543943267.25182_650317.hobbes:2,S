Subject: [PATCH 0/2] x86 - Move laptop drivers out of x86 Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patch series moves the two laptop drivers from x86 Kconfig (i8k
and toshiba) to drivers/char, which is where the source for them lives anyway.
Given they are not x86 processor features, the x86 Kconfig menu is not really
an appropriate place for them to live.
This is against Linus latest tree, since x86 git seems to be missing an
earlier Kconfig patch for I8K that dropped the x86_32 limitation.
