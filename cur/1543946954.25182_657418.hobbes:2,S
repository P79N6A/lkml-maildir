Well it would be only a single way to create the "aux memory controller
map" (or however it will be called). Basically just a call to single
function from a few different places.

First i386 with 64GB just doesn't work, at least not with default 3:1
split. Just calculate it yourself how much of the lowmem area is left
after the 64GB mem_map is allocated. Typical rule of thumb is that 16GB
is the realistic limit for 32bit x86 kernels. Worrying about
anything more does not make much sense.

Yes and if you increase mem_map you need exactly the same space
in lowmem too. So increasing the vmalloc reservation for this is
equivalent. Just make sure you use highmem backed vmalloc.
