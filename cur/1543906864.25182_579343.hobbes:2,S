HPET is not working on my notebook with 64-bit kernel. HPET is detected
by kernel
  # dmesg | grep -i hpet
  ACPI: HPET 3FFA9760, 0038 (r1 A M I  OEMHPET0  4000724 MSFT 97)
  ACPI: HPET id: 0x10de8201 base: 0xfed00000
  hpet0: at MMIO 0xfed00000, IRQs 2, 8, 31
  hpet0: 3 32-bit timers, 25000000 Hz
  Time: hpet clocksource has been installed.
  hpet_resources: 0xfed00000 is busy
but not listed in /proc/timer_list. When i use HRT (tickless) kernel
patches the system stall at boot until i press and hold any key.
I test every HRT kernel starting from linux-2.6.22-rc3-hrt1
with the same result.
PS: i386 kernel with similar configuration works with HPET without any
trouble.
Sincerely yours,
Mikhail Kshevetskiy
