ENOUGH!  This arrogant "Holier Than Thou" discussion is vile and evil.
Perhaps we should rename Linux to LinBSD and establish a politburo 
censorship committee.  We can thus shield ourselves from the good 
ideas and hard work that originates among the unwashed masses.
Open Source cannot possibly benefit from scrutiny by those who frequent 
Slashdot, eh?  I wonder... does the same criticism we apply to Slashdot 
also apply to those who frequent this list...
It seems that the "inner circle" of kernel developers concur with your 
argument.  The truly important LinBSD discussions are now appearing 
less and less frequently on this list.  Maybe the real work is being done 
in some secret meeting place where the signal to noise ratio is lower.
Congratulations people, you have already achieved that which you wish for.  
The strength of Open Source derives from the practice of TEACHING OTHERS 
CORRECT PRINCIPLES AND THEN ALLOWING THEM TO ACT FOR THEMSELVES! 
If you advocate exclusionary development practices then lets sell LinBSD 
rights to some commercial interest with deep pockets and make some 
real money.  
Otherwise, please climb down from your high horses, help some newbies 
along in their trek to enlightenment, and welcome their help in our quest 
for world domination.
