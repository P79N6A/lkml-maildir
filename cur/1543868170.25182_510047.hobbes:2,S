smp_call_function_single() was added with commit:
eaa70773e750cc09d60938bceacd028bc76b8e3a
   [PATCH] i386: add smp_call_function_single
    Continiung the series of small patches necessary for the perfmon subsystem,
    here is a patch that adds support for the smp_call_function_single()
    function for i386.  It exists for almost all other architectures but i386.
    The perfmon subsystem needs it in one case to free some state on a
    designated remote CPU.
It's not an obscure kvm API :) But the claim that it is available on
almost all other architectures but i386 is wrong. Only x86_64, ia64 and
i386 have it.
The function is defined in include/linux/smp.h and there is no
indication that it is an architecture specific thingy. What a steaming
pile of ....
