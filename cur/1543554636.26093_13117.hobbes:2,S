In your document, you don't mention any setting of CPU type.  That would
be right above the SMP setting.  You say you have a celeron... the
default processor setting is P3, and there's a different setting for
PPro/P2/Celerons.  Improper processor selection has caused a bundle of
rather abrupt and unexplained hangs for me...
BTW, you could compile the RTL8139 driver into the kernel... It works
fine for me.  For what it's worth.  Nothing wrong with modules anyway...
