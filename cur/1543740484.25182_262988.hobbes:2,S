A lot of things are perfectly "valid" in the Linux kernel regarding
stuff like that are a bit irregular. But the preemption work about
to stress these things in ways that was never designed to which is
why these patches are needed. Having a clear use of various locking
conventions is key to getting this system to behave in a predictable
manner. Quite simply, Linux was never targetted to do this and the
sloppiness is showing so it's got to be removed.
