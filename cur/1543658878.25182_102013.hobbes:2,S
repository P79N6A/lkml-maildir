Well, of course I want to keep it - but I am biased :)
I think its a simple export that gives us a neat feature.  Additionally,
from the procps perspective, it saves us from having to parse System.map
for each process.  In fact, it means we do not need a System.map at all
for any procps functionality.
I guess Linus at least mildly liked it too, since he merged it.
But if its such a performance crippling item perhaps it does need to be
removed (or somehow restricted).
I do agree that, if possible, wchan should be kept simple... so, is
everyone else for the removal of /proc/pid/wchan ? :-(
