As his colleague, I'd like to add some explanation about the "ext2
robust" patch, showing my own experience.
Last month I tried to compile linux 2.2.x kernel but it failed.
Doubting that I made some mistakes, I checked error log and eventually
I found that NTFS makefile had turned into a strange binary file.
It is worth noticing that I have never touched NTFS makefile before
(I do not use NTFS) and my machine crashes a few times per month.
I can not say positively, but perhaps it is because some new directory
entry which contains garbage (on disk) was allocated for some new
file.  If the garbage data points NTFS makefile accidentally and system
crashes before the directory entry is written back, new file and NTFS
makefile are doubly hard-linked. Someone writes binary data to the new
file, NTFS makefile would be also altered...
The patch prevents these filesystem corruption, by altering write-order
in ext2 fs (on above example, inode syncronously written first, data 
block asyncronously written in future. Look at the URL for more details)
Although robustness is up to the write-order inside the disk unit when
power failed, as Hubert Tonneau <hubert.tonneau@heliosam.fr>
previously pointed out.

In some critical fields, it is acceptable to use write-through-cache
mode, in spite of performance decrease (I have heard that write through
cache mode on SCSI disk suffers performance decrease of 5 to 10%)

As he says, the same kind of robustness can be achieved from
journalling, but saving intent log to the disk is not always necessary
for robustness.  Writing log to the disk synchronously decreases
performance.
And more, needless to say, it is not so important to save data block
contents (they are lost by crash anyway), but to save file system
consistency.
Thank you.
