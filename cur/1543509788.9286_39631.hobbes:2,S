Same here. And given that NFS v2 isn't the fastest on earth anyway, I
think we can stand the performance hit in exchange for Linux working with
AIX & unpatched Solaris/SunOS servers (and possibly some Sun-NFS
licensees)

Yup, the SunSolve ID for SunOS 2.5.1/Sparc is T105299-02, and I suspect
that you can reference to the others from this (if I'm not all wrong, it's
105299-02 for the other platforms; only the SunOS 2.5.1 patch is a
Test-patch.)
