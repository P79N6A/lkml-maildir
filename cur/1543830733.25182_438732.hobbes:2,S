The way libgcc is handled inside gcc is, indeed, completely screwed up; 
even the gcc people admit that.  They pretty much don't have a way to 
handle the effects of compiler options on libgcc, especially the ones 
that affect binary compatibility.
However, that affects only a small minority of configurations (MIPS is one.)

That's just an asinine statement.  Under that logic we should just 
forget about the kernel and go hack the gcc bugs du jour; we certainly 
have enough workarounds for gcc bugs in the kernel.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with providing an override for a 
function which has well-defined semantics.  If new functions are needed, 
they are pulled from libgcc.
