Right. And on semaphores, this stream is exactly 0 bytes long.
This is perfectly normal and can be handled by all applications
I'm aware of.
My idea violates nothing here.

Right. And with my approach read() and write() with a buffer
pointer != NULL would either yield an return value of "0" or
-1 and set errno=EINVAL ("object not suitable for reading/writing").
Anyway they should return IMMIDIATELY in these cases.
We already have these special semantics with devices. Look at
/dev/sgX for an example how we pass even structured data via
normal read/write (instead of "stream of bytes").

see above. NOTHING special about this idea. No magic handling
involved, unless the user of the fd knows what it is. For other
users it will be just a normal fd with normal operations, since
the special case is hidden well enough. 
This is even WAY simpler as all that tty-crap and similar
devices, which read/write very dependend on their actual ioctl
configuration.
But since stupid POSIX forbids using fds for semaphores
(according to Ulrich Drepper), this nice, simple and
non-intrusive solution is out.
Instead we should go with several new syscalls, user space
dependencies, strange error handling and yet-to-discuss
semantics.
Everybody else byt you would have been kicked out by the core
people for suggesting this ;-)
