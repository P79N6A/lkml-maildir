The part of his patch that enlarges the type of kbentry.kb_table
and kbentry.kb_index are needed if you ever want to use keycode
above 255. These indices are defined as unsigned char, but
NR_KEYS in 2.6 is 512 (see include/linux/keyboard.h and
include/linux/input.h) as opposed to 128.
If you are not interested in using keycode above 255 (e.g. all
you care about is keycode 183 for Japanese 86/106 keyboard),
then the patch I sent to the list should be sufficient.
