tried looking at what `uname` returns?
[wakko@ani:/] uname
Linux

[wakko@ani:/] locate stddef

I don't believe you compile them like you do a program.  SCIIW, but modules
should be compiled with -c and not linked.  Try ldd'ing one of them:
[wakko@ani:/] ldd /lib/modules/2.2.10/block/floppy.o
        not a dynamic executable
[wakko@ani:/] 
Sorry I can't help you on #3
