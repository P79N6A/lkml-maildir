http://www.acme.com
          - thttpd
http://www.roxen.com
         - roxen
http://www.boa.org
           - boa
http://www.zeus.co.uk
        - zeus

  - khttpd
I use Apache and thttpd only right now, and I've used Boa and Roxen. I
know of people using Zeus, and it's pretty damn fast too.  I'm going to
start beta testing khttpd as soon as I get a free second.  I can
personally testify that thttpd is orders of magnitude faster than Apache,
but it's a pain to add anything to it beyond basic static content.
