I made some further tests with my drive. At first I added a SMO-F541 to
the chain to verify if it is a scsi problem or something else.
With the sony all went ok on the 53C94 and on the Adaptec-2940UW.
As stated above the resets on the scsi bus occurs only when no cartridge
is inserted and I try to mount one. But this only happens on the 53C94
bus, ont the adaptec it only says bus reseting. And then it does so and
comes back while on the 53C94 I have to hardboot the machine due to
repeating scsi resets.
Summary, I see two problems here, first a 'damned' silly HP-optical
(C1716T) which really seems to be to old to run perfectly under Linux
and second, a mac53c94 driver which may have some bugs.
My knowledge seems to be at the end, I don't know how to go further.....
If anyone has an idea or something else I'd like to try it.
Thanks for any hint.
Andreas
