Unlikely.  The way from silicon wafer to chip is 4 to 8 weeks, so it's
more efficient (and makes it easier to follow the market) to produce one
line and select/configure them after production.
The differences are more like blown fuse links or external jumpers on
the carrier board that select a mode of operation.  I think the Celerons
have the actually same cache on the die as the Pentiums which is just
halved by a configuration fuse.

More likely.  There are essentially three types of possible XPs:
a) Passed MP, but market needs no more MPs
b) Not tested for MP, market asks for lots of XPs
c) Failed MP test, sold as XP
If you're lucky, you get a pair of type a) and it works.  Types b) and
c) may appear to work 99.9% of the time ("it works for me") but that
does not make a stable system.  Type c) may even work for months, until
the first summer sun shines into your room and gives the extra few
degrees of heat that crashes your system.
