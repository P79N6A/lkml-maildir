The ES1371 driver (with an Ensoniq AudioPCI) has the same problem (seen
in 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.1ac2 on a 164LX).  However, the mixer works fine
(with non-PCM audio sources, of course).
I'll be spending some time attempting to track things down this coming
weekend.  I've ported a fair amount of mistyped code to the Alpha, but
never a driver... we'll see.
