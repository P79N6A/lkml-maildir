Because they're useful for many people.
It's easy to rephrase that question to:
"Why should I waste my disk space with SCSI drivers?"
"Why should I waste my disk space with MIPS support?"
"Why should I waste my disk space with bluetooth drivers?"
In each of these cases you'll get the same answer that I gave
to your question.
