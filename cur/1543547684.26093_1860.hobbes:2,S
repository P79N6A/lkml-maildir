A kernel debugger will reduce development costs.  No one cares what's
underneath, they just care about getting their stuff out the door and
reducing the $$$ to support it.  This whole argument is one of control
and not of technical merit.  I'm putting it out in MANOS and it's there
for Linux.  Linus can use it if he want's it.  ALL of my developers and
folks I deal with say this is a good idea.
