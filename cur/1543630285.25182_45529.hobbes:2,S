Yeah, I know. Some people like the long ones, though, and they _are_
useful if you want to get a more detailed view.
I definitely don't want to maintain a separate set of short logs, but the
answer may be to just do both: have the existing long log (with no merging
of changesets, so that people see the actual commit boundaries), and a
separate "short" version that also merges the thing.
As an example, if the long version looks like this:
	<jsimmons@heisenberg.transvirtual.com>
	        A bunch of fixes.
	<jsimmons@heisenberg.transvirtual.com>
	        Pmac updates
	<jsimmons@heisenberg.transvirtual.com>
	        Some more small fixes.
	<rmk@arm.linux.org.uk>
	        [PATCH] 2.5.13: vmalloc link failure
	        The following patch fixes this, and also fixes the similar problem in
	        scsi_debug.c:
	...
The short version could look like
	jsimmons@heisenberg.transvirtual.com:
		A bunch of fixes.
		Pmac updates
		Some more small fixes.
	rmk@arm.linux.org.uk:
		[PATCH] 2.5.13: vmalloc link failure
	...
ie only take the first line, and merge entries with the same author.
Perl people, stand up.
