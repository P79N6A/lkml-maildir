I appreciate your effort. I am glad to see that the interface
and implementation survived yet another architecture. I think at this
point ARM is the only major architecture missing. In anycase, I would
be happy to integrate your sparc64 patches.

As I said earlier, I am not opposed to changing the syscalls. I have
proposed a few schemes to address the issue of versioning. If vectors
arguments are problematic, we can go with single register/call.
I think there are other areas where perfmon2 could benefit from the
help of the LKML developers. I will post a list shortly.
