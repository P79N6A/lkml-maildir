Some of us think that the tools can protect /etc/shadow just fine on their
own, and are concerned with rogue software that abuses /etc/shadow without
bothering to safely modify it..

*bzzt* wrong.  Why should "gshadow" matter? (Think carefully about what
happens when a setUID program gets exploited and used to scribble on /etc/shadow -
black hats rarely bother to do locking and other such niceties....)

It's not. include/linux/security.h:
 * @inode_link:
 *      Check permission before creating a new hard link to a file.
 *      @old_dentry contains the dentry structure for an existing link to the file.
 *      @dir contains the inode structure of the parent directory of the new link.
 *      @new_dentry contains the dentry structure for the new link.
 *      Return 0 if permission is granted.

include/linux/security.h:
 * @file_receive:
 *      This hook allows security modules to control the ability of a process
 *      to receive an open file descriptor via socket IPC.
 *      @file contains the file structure being received.
 *      Return 0 if permission is granted.
Already a solved problem.
