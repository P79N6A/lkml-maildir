Such thing happened to me once, but it traced back to a faulty SIMM. It
was in the days of 2.0.2x kernel, computer in question is P166, 64 MB RAM,
IWILL motherboard with built-in AIC 7880 SCSI. 
At some point I started experiencing problems with copying large (tens of
MB) files. Small files (<1MB) copied quite OK. With big ones, the copy
just differed from original. What's curious, memtest showed no errors on
that computer, Windows also ran without problems with those SIMMs. I
replaced faulty SIMMs with ECC ones, and I don't have any such problems
for more than a year (knocking on wood)
