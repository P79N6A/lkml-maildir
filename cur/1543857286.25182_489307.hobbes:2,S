No, the configuration
  CONFIG_VIDEO_SAA7134=y
  CONFIG_VIDEO_SAA7134_DVB=n
  CONFIG_VIDEO_BUF_DVB=n
builds fine in 2.6.19.
Only the saa7134-dvb and cx88-dvb modules require video-buf-dvb, and the 
config options for them select VIDEO_BUF_DVB.

No, that's already handled correctly by both VIDEO_CX88_DVB and 
VIDEO_SAA7134_DVB depending on DVB_CORE.

That would be a noop since VIDEO_BUF_DVB is a not user visible option 
that gets select'ed.

There is no problem these #ifdef's would solve in Linus' tree...
