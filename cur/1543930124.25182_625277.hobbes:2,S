Pardon my ignorance, but is port 0xed really safe to push an out cycle 
at across the entire x86_64 family?  How long must real _p pauses be in 
reality?  (and who cares about what the code calls "really slow i/o").
Why are we waiting at all?  I read the comments in io_64.h, and am a bit 
mystified.  Does Windoze or DOS do this magical mystery wait?
Anyway, the virtualization hooks in 32-bit x86 almost make it possible 
to isolate this simply - maybe - after the merge of 32/64 being 
contemplated.
And anyone who knows what the chipset might be doing with the 80 port 
rather than POST codes, perhaps could contribute.  Any nvidia folks who 
know what's happening under NDA?  Any Phoenix BIOS types?
I think the worst of the problems would be fixed by changing just the 
CMOS_READ/CMOS_WRITE macros.   But the danger lingers in the *_p code.
