Break them anymore than they currently are?
I wouldn't recommend using those functions. We're in the process of
redeveloping the Runtime PM infrastructure and would hate to break users
of existing poorly-designed infrastructure in the process.
I'm curious what your usage model would be. After a certain amount of
time of inactivity, I suspect that you want to power down a PCMCIA slot,
right? Do you already have patches that do that? Is there any problem with
calling the necessary functions directly?
Thanks,
