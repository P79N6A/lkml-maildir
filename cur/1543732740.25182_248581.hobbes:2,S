As of -R0 it's definitely stable on UP and SMP users are reporting the
same.  All known problems should be fixed, and there are no known
regressions.  You should probably post a UP version and have your users
test that before posting SMP packages, the latter are not quite as well
tested.
No other patches (ie various scheduler tweaks, CK) should be necessary,
and in fact are not recommended because they might mask latency issues
that we would rather fix.
I use Debian unstable which should be pretty close to AGNULA, and for
several weeks now I have been unable to produce an xrun in jack at 32
frames no matter what I throw at the machine.  I actually have not had
xrun debugging enabled in weeks because I don't get any xruns.
Any problems at this point are most likely going to involve less common
hardware, stuff the LKML testers don't have.
