You can not do much in such cases. This is outstanding Linux's problem, not
something simple and easily fixable. Linux kernel is not multithreaded and this
mean that when kernel doing work (say flushing MySQL data on disk) userlevel
process can not interrupt it. Work is going to improve situation (important
file operations in 2.3 do not require global filesystem lock anymore) but
system still fell REALLY sluggish here while heavy swapping even with latest
2.3 (or even without heavy swapping but will high LA while parrallel make
compiling kernel). Plus Linux is REALLY bad when it's out of memory and this
also is VERY slowly changing. You can limit PROCESS'S cpu but you can not
limit KERNEL'S cpu and in your second example your system was mostly waited
for disk to deliver data in kernel mode (as for first example: 2.3 should help
great deal here but do not install it on production server now :-)
