C and C++ are both good for some things, but what I want most of the time is C+.
I'd like a C with the C++ features that aid clarity, and none of the stuff that
deprecates the developer's tight control of things. Sure you can write pure C  with
a C++ compiler - a simple trick used to increase apparent productivity in places
that measure people in KLOCs. In practice it never works out too well, and you
always end up with some C++ baggage in the result. I think disdain for some of the
excesses of C++ has made most low level developers shy away from the greater
clarity a half way house language might give.

Eh? Most of the OO test books I've seen give you the idea that a programmer's life
consists mostly of multiply inheriting. In practice I have never multiply
inherited. In fact, I've never received a single lawyer's letter telling me of just
one inheritance!
My very first job way in an object oriented hardware development environment -
suggest a good idea and everyone objected to it!

Here, here. Those who can do; those who can't teach. That's why so many people are
taught some damned strange things.

Let's cook up a class. Eye of toad, ear of bat, ...... Multiple inheritance has a
tendancy to sum all the worst, rather than all the best, of the things inherited
from. I guess it doesn't have to be that way, but it seems to be "standard
practice".
