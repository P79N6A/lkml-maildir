I'd suggest that you go with the PG_partial thing for the
follow-on pages.
If you have a patch for crashdumps, and that patch is
included in the main kernel, and it happens to rely on the
addition of a new page flag well gee, that's a tiny change.
Plus it only affects code paths in the `order > 0' case,
which are rare.
Plus you can independently use PG_partial to detect when
someone is freeing pages from the wrong part of a higher-order
allocation - that's a feature ;)
An alternative is to just set PG_inuse against _all_ pages
in rmqueue(), and clear PG_inuse against all pages in
__free_pages_ok().  Which seems cleaner, and would fix other
problems, I suspect.
