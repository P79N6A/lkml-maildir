It would be, if it weren't artificially so, for violates several kernel 
coding standards, one being that the "case" labels indent with the switch, 
not under it (the other being the placement of braces).

No, that's not it at all. We don't indent 'case' because it matches with 
the 'switch', not because of any room issues.

It's not at all inconsistent. It's just making clear how the parts of the 
function group together.
Indenting a case-statement an extra level is as stupid as indenting "else" 
one extra level from the "if ()" it goes together with. Do you think that 
would be sane?
The fact that the 'case' thing is technically parsed as a separate 
statement in C doesn't change anything.
