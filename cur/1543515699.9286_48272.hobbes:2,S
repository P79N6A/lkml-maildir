Thanks. Yes, I've looked through that. It looks like you are working with
something like a microkernel. Is the stuff you've mentioned in a separate
server? Does it need the direct access to kernel data structures?
As an aside, I dearly hope that I'll never have to search for bugs in the
code written in that style. It's not a flame, just that you are using 
wildly different style of C (ahem... C++, and usage of exceptions was,
erm, unexpected thing to see in the kernel code, but that's another
story). It's very hard to read. Sorry.
