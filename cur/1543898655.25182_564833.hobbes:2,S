Lustre needs to be able to control the version number directly (version
number needs to be ordered between all inodes, is set by Lustre to be a
transaction number).  Instead of trying to incorporate this unused code
into ext4 we just turn off the ext4 version code and let Lustre control
this directly.  It may even be that NFSv4 will need to control the version
numbers itself...
Cheers, Andreas
