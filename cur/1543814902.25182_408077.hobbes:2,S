Sorry, I did the testing simply by playing mp3s while doing heavy I/O.
The 128KB window size do not need these cond_resched()s, yet the
1024KB window size do.  With this patch, I do not feel any latency
issues with CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE. 
But I'm not sure it is the case for others, for there has been user
reports of audio jitters(without further informations, hence still an
open problem).
Anyway, numbers will be collected soon ...
Cheers,
Wu
