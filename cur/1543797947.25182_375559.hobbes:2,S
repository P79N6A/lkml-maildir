Yes. SCHED_BATCH in Ingo's implementation is more like turning off the 
interactive setting in staircase, and the idle scheduling staircase offers is 
extremely useful.

Fairly standard in Unices but prone to all sorts of priority inversion 
starvation scenarios so very few implement it. In freebsd for example you can 
use their idle scheduling only if you are root to prevent this starvation - 
which kind of makes it useless in practice. My implementation is fairly 
robust at avoiding the priority inversion problem - at least I haven't seen a 
bug report about it for years since I address it :)
