Please call these MSR_* instead, "IA32_*" isn't very descriptive,
besides, the preferred prefix in existing locations in the Linux
kernel is "X86_", e.g. X86_EFLAGS_IF or X86_CR4_PSE.  I think there
are standard symbolic names for most MSRs in volume 3 of the Intel
processor manuals; I would suggest we use those.
