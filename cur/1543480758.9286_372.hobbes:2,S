Horrible --- smells like the old problem of "oh, our VM is hopeless at
tuning performance itself, so let's rely on magic numbers to constrain
it to reasonable performance".  I'd much much much much rather see a VM
which manages to work well without having to be constrained by tricks
like that (although by all means supply extra boundary limits for use in
special cases: just don't enable them on a default system).
