 Something that came to mind on reading this thread that I want
 clarification on.. Take for example, the case of an IDE controller.
 If on shutdown we walk the driverfs tree shutting things down,
 it's going to power off its hard disks, then do whatever magic is
 needed to the ide host bridge.
 This makes sense for a shutdown, and suspend-to-disk, but not for
 a reboot imo (senseless spinning down/up of drives).
 So some means is probably going to be needed for drivers to
 distinguish between a reboot & shutdown/suspend.
 There may be other such devices too, but this was the more
 obvious one that came to mind. Or am I way off base here?
