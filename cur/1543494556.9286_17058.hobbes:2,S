Hello!
For God's sake could someone explain me, what is the difference
between our sendfile() and plain write() from mmap()ed region?
The only difference, which I see now is that sendfile() ALLOWS
to make zero-copy NOT WORSE than usual write(), right?
Resuming, sendfile() without zero-copy is pure cheating,
if we added it to API it means that we plan to implement zero copy
one day. 8)
BTW is it really true, that NT transmitfile() does zero copy?
I strongly suspect, it does not.
Alexey
