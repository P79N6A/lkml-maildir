Nice.  This removes a deadlock we hit, where if creating a device mapper 
target blocks indefinitely (say on network IO) then nobody else can 
complete a device mapper operation because BKL is held.  If completing 
the device create depends on some other device mapper operation, then 
it is game over.
Our current workaround is to test for and drop BKL, ugh.  Thanks for the 
cleanup.
