I recently changed to kernel nfs (RedHat Rawhide distribution
with the revision listed as 981204).
When I try and export / I get an error message - 
"xxxx.edu:/ invalid argument"
The Kernel NFS page indicates that, as of 2.1.126 
"if you export / and /usr is in the same partition, then you can mount /usr."
so NFS mounting of root appears legal.
I am running 2.2.2
Do I have incorrect syntax, or...?
