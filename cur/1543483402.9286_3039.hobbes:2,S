It seams as if I lost the ability to write Swedish characters after
upgrading to 2.2.0. The swedish character-set is loaded, and the right NLS
modules are also loaded, not that that should matter on the command
prompt. Things are working like they used to in X, but on
the console and in console apps I just get odd characters whenever I try
to use these chars. I talked to a another swedish linux user on #linux the
other night, and he had noticed the same behaviour after his upgrade to
the 2.2 kernel, so I thought I would post a message just in case this is
a bug. My appologies if this is a trivial thing, and something silly I've
just missed.
