Yes. Thus the brackets (or lack of them) of do-while loops should
never be forced as a part of coding standard/tools. This is just an
unimportant detail of personal style and trying to force it is simply
damaging to all of us.

There are many ways to make the code more merge friendly at a cost of
readability. Hope we don't go this way.
