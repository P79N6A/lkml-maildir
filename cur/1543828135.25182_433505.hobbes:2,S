Join the club, I am looking for one too.
Too bad that the Forth interpreter can only address a little less than 
640KB of memory (reminds me of DOS huh), otherwise I would have written a 
memchecker.

There exists a userspace checker. It mlock()s a big chunk of memory and 
pokes on it like memtest86. It does not catch the few megabytes required 
for booting, but when you swap the upper half of the memory banks with the 
lower ones and rerun, you should get the same results of memtest86 would 
do.
