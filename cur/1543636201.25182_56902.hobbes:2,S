2.2.14-5 ? you probably want to be working on something newer.
for anyone to even have a chance at figuring out what`s going on with your system, you`ll have
to run the, quote : "'Aiie, killing the interrupt handler' and much more stuff" (aka a kernel oops message), 
through ksymoops and show us the result. have a look at Documentation/oops-tracing.txt or the ksymoops 
documentation for more information.
