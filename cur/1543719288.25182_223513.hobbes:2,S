Ok, let's analyze that first.
The dd tests gave the following results:
ext3 on the internal scsi HD:
  2.4.21:
     writing : 1m14s
     reading : 1m2s
     reading+writing : 2m16s
  2.6.4:
     writing : 1m19s
     reading : 59s
     reading+writing : 2m24s
reiserfs on the internal scsi HD:
  2.4.21:
     writing : 1m15s
     reading : 1m1s 
     reading+writing : 2m22s
  2.6.4:
     writing : 1m19s
     reading : 1m 
     reading+writing : 2m25s
ext3 on the raid using qlogic fc-scsi:
  2.4.21:
     writing : 30s
     reading : 51s
     reading+writing : 1m29s
  2.6.4:
     writing : 28s
     reading : 1m26s
     reading+writing : 2m19s
reiserfs on the raid using qlogic fc-scsi:
  2.4.21:
     writing : 37s
     reading : 52s
     reading+writing : 1m37s
  2.6.4:
     writing : 25s
     reading : 1m27s
     reading+writing : 2m3s
All the tests were made 3 times, and the average taken. In the cases where 
there was too much variance, I repeated the tests some more times.
All the tests used 2Gb reads/writes (. I tried to make 8Gb reads/writes too, 
but they got up to a minute variance (maybe the HD slowed itself down due to 
temperature issues sometimes? I really don't know why this happened, but in 
any case, I couldn't make reliable tests with files of that size).
So basically, there's no difference between 2.4.21 and 2.6.4 when using the 
internal HD, but 2.6.4 is much slower when using the raid.
What I found strange is that writing to that raid is a bit faster on 2.6.4 
while reading is much slower, which I suppose is what makes the difference.
So yes, I suppose there's a regression on the qlogic fc-scsi module.
Btw, the tests I timed were:
count=2048
write() { dd if=/dev/zero of=x bs=1M count=$count ; sync }
read() { dd if=x of=/dev/null bs=1M count=$count }
readwrite() { dd if=x of=y bs=1M count=$count ; sync }
In the case of read, I did the sync just before and after the timing, but 
didn't include the sync inside the timed test.
As I said in my other mail, I can test any patch if needed.
Greetings and thanks for any help
