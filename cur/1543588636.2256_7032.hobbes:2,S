Strange trace but it looks like a bug in the -ac experimental multithreaded
core dump patches. I've got a couple of other reports consistent with them
being broken somewhere 
Does it have to be something like mozilla (xmms also probably breaks it) that
does this. If so I suspect its specific to multithreaded apps and its a bug
in the core dump changes.
If so I guess I revert them
