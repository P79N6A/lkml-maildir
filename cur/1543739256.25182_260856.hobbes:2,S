DMI scan may still be relevant. Previously we used it to
override the default force-enable policy. Now we may still
need it to force-disable the lapic on systems that boot with
it enabled but malfunction if it's used. (I don't know of
any, but given BIOS history, they aren't impossible.)
So the comment doesn't need to change.

Looks Ok

I agree with Alan that accusing the BIOS of being buggy is unwarranted.
The text should just state the obvious:
The local APIC was disabled by the BIOS.
You can enable it with "lapic".

To implicitly include P4 and K8, just change this to:
Intel P6 and later, and AMD K7 (Model > 1) and later
