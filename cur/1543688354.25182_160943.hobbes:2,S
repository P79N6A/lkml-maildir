Am I the only one having problems with code like this?
(Not Randy's, the original.)
1. void* and function pointers are not interchangeable.
   The casts should be to (void(*)(void*)) not (void*).
2. If shedule_bh() causes handler to be invoked as a
   (void(*)(void*)), then handler had better point to a
   function with exactly that prototype and nothing else.
   Fixing this also eliminates the need for the casts.
IMO changing whitespace while these issues remain is just
a waste of time.
