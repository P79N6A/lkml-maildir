sorry, I disagree. for example, NUMA isn't default and shouldn't be.
but we have it in the tree and any one may choose to use it. the same
with extents. let's have it in. but let's make clear it's experimental,
it makes sense for large files only, it isn't backward compatible and
so on.
thanks, Alex
