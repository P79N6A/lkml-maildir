Subject: [M68KNOMMU]: simplify ColdFire resume code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It is useless to preserve THREAD_SR in `resume'.  The real user's sr
is actually in the stack.  We also don't need to disable interrupts :
we'll never be in an invalid state, the sp switch is atomic.
