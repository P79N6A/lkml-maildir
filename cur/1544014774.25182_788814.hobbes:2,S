Nobody merged it and Ingo got bored of pushing it. I sent it earlier, 
but nobody came up with an especially good argument for the 
configurability and everyone seemed to want to paint the patch pink with 
yellow polka dots, so I gave up and just sent a minimal one in the hope 
that nobody could find anything to complain about.

If mtime is changed then atime will be updated on the next access, so 
you can easily have more than one atime update a day.
