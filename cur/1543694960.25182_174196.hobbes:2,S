Well the circular... is certainly not in any way mine, although I find
it interesting. I think that using policy to produce a deterministic
result is just what you get by tuning any scheduler, from Ingo, Con,
Nick, or anyone else. Putting the bias in the algorithm is another way
to do it, assuming that's what you meant.

Don't expect me to defend it, not my idea. I hold that the next major
advance will come from having VM, elevator, and scheduler all sharing
hints, but I have no proposal on that, by any name.
