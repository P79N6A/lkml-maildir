Although it can happen. I used to see corrupted data in /etc/motd (which is
rewritten on each boot up) and random SEGVs on an embedded box. A few weeks
later the drive started to report real errors. After mapping out the bad blocks
using e2fsck -c, and replacing the files that were affected, the problem
disappeared.
Looks like ECC is not always ECC...

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
