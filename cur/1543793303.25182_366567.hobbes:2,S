Are you missing some left and right part too? What are the dimensions of
the text screen at bootup? What bootloader are you using? (It could be a
bug in the boot up text screen dimension discovery).

Does vgacon.c properly discovers that it is a VGA board?

Do vga-only games (like old DOS-mode games) work with it?

I.e. never call it, actually.

I'm not sure it is hardware-specific. Maybe you have a combination of
vga bios/bootloader/vga=ask/... that prevents vgacon.c from properly
discovering the dimensions of the text screen.
Well, else it looks like a "safe side" patch: people now hit by such bug
won't be hit any more unless using stty or such.
