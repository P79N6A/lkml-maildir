Continue to allocate the boot PDA of the BP statically - this should
be ok because BP should be always on node 0 (or if you're paranoid
about it you could also reallocate, but it's probably not needed) 
And for the APs you allocate the PDA in smpboot.c before actually sending
the startup IPI to the AP.
