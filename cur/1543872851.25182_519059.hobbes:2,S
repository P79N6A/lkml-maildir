How would you propose doing this? I'm sure modern distros with an 
initrd/initramfs probably already do some sort of root detection. Doesn't fix 
the fstab issue, but I suppose this could be auto-generated too.

I doubt this matters for distributors, as they'll simply switch over when you 
upgrade the distro, and the earliest supported kernel will be the one that 
shipped with the newer version.
I accept that it's a bit of a drag, but it's better to have a standard naming 
convention for all disks, isn't it?
Glad this is working for you.
