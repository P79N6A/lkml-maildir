Hi:
	Since I upgraded to 2.2.3, Corel WorldPerfect 8 will no longer start (
it worked great under 2.0.35 ).
	When I try to start it, I get an error alocating memory on a call to
fork.    
Here is my config:
Packard Bell Legend 2440 (Intel P133/32megs ram)
RedHat Linux 5.1
Linux 2.2.3 release kernel
SoundBlaster Virba16c  (CTL0070)
GLIBC 2.0.7
Anyone else having this problem?
Thanks
Jim Torelli
