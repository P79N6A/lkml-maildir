As a general note, the hottest issues from last week got fixed, most of the
remaining issues are from the Fedora 9 (beta) kernels, specifically from various patches
that will otherwise go into the next merge window.

warning reports from various mailing lists and bugzillas as well as
with a client users can install to auto-submit oopses.
Below is a top 10 list of the oopses collected in the last 7 days.
(Reports prior to 2.6.23 have been omitted in collecting the top 10)
