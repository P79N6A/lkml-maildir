This talks about a completely different bug.
We are talking here about inconsistant ordering of lock acquisition
when both mapping->i_shared_lock and mm->page_table_lock must be
held simultaneously.
The thread you quoted merely mentions the issue we have mm->rss
modifications are not always protected properly by the
page_table_lock.
There were no previous public discussions about the
i_shared_lock/page_table_lock deadlock problems.
