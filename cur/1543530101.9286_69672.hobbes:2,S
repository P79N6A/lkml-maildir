Which is why the solution is two-part:
  * An OOM killer good enough to handle the "some process went insane"
    case.  From all accounts, Rik's patch does this well.
  * Comprehensive per-uid resource accounting (the beancounting work)
    to guard against malicious users.  This would be great for 2.5
    (but, of course, that was said about 2.3 as well..)  A full
    implementation would also fix DoSes against users using kernel
    memory (network buffers, page table mappings) which is a lot
    nastier than simple VM exhaustion.
