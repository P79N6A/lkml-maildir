The DMI info is suspiciously similar to ours, as well. Same "Board
Version"...

They never gave you a case number?

Woohoo!

For me, the new ACPI didn't help (just had the same table, USB on IRQ
9). And, of course, it doesn't actually do the routing, just displays it
(for now).
I'm leaning toward the "Stolen from Kai" patch over the "stolen from
you" patch. Seems a bit less hackish, and IMHO, the "correct" behavior
anyway (honoring the irq mask). Of course, that could bite us on PIR
tables with bad masks. Thoughts?
