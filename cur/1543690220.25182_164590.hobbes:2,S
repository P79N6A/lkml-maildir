Greg,
> Great, go bug vmware then :)
I will -- but ...
I was under the impression that all of VMware's USB code is running in 
user space. Running "grep -ir usb ." in VMware's modules/source 
directory did not return any hits, so this assumption is probably correct.
This does look like a kernel bug to me, since it should not be possible 
to crash the OHCI driver from user space.
Regards, Remo
