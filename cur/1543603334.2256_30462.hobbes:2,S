(i searched the web and mailing list archives and havent found it (in fact
this is the first mention i saw) - could you give me a link so i can take
a look at it? I just found your slides but no link to actual code.
Thanks!)
but the objectives, judging from the description you gave, are i think
largely orthogonal, with some overlapping in the polling part. The polling
part of my patch is just a few quick lines here and there and it's not
intrusive at all. I needed it to make sure all problems are solved and
that the system & network is actually usable in overload situations.
you i think are concentrating on router performance (i'd add dedicated
networking appliances to the list), using cooperative drivers. I trying to
solve a DoS attack against 2.4 boxes, and i'm trying to guarantee the
uninterrupted (pun unintended) functioning of the system from the point of
the IRQ handler code.
