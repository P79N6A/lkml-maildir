Don't do that. It is too insecure.
1. the structure you describe is FRAGILE. Just adding one more entry 
could/would break the entire structure.
2. If you mix security structures like this you WILL get a problem.
What you do is copy the declassified data to a nonsecure area (also known
as released data). This way the user can modify internal cata without
causing the web server potentially catastrophic releases.
Same with the SQL. Do not attmept to mix sensitive and nonsensitive data
this way.
If you web server got hacked, how do you prevent the hack from ADDING
more links? Or adding SQL injections to other applications...
If you've get this much disk space, then you can afford to provide isolated
data too.
