I still think this is probably because your trying to use more sysV
memory that then kernel will allow.
You either have to up this value by patching the kernel in the case
of 2.0.x) or by increasing /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax. In the laters
2.2.x-ac kernels you can certainly do this:
  echo "64 1024 2 ^ * p" | dc > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
to set the maximum amount of shared memory to 64MB.

ok... I didn't read this at forst. What does 
  cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
say?
