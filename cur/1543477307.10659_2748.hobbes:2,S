Or there's the possibility that clearing the setUID bits will break
some scripts.  Even if the scripts themselves aren't setUID, the
programs they exec might very well be.  If adduser or something
changes owner of a setUID program when it's installed, then the script
has to be rewritten.  Unlikely, but possible, and experienced admins
expect standard utilities to operate in a certain manner.
