Yes, I wholeheartedly agree.  Also, the notion that it's userspace's
responsibility to clear memory before exiting is preposterous.  That would
involve just about every piece of software ever made to be rewritten (you
could change glibc to clear memory on free()s but what about the stack?).

Yes.  If you snoop long enough, it becomes possible to read passords and
other sensitive data.  Granted, this is only on the local network, but
it is still a major hole.
