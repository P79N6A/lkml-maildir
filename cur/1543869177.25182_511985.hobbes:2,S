I have fully synchronous kevent signal delivery for that purpose :)
Having all events synchronous allows trivial handling of them -
including signals.

Hmm, yes, for such scenario we need some kind of event delivery
mechanism, which would allow to wait on different kinds of events.
In the above sentence I see known to pain letters - 
letter k
letter e
letter v
letter e
letter n
letter t
Or more modern trend - async_wait(epoll).
