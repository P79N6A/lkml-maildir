This is not true. lufis is a compatibility layer on top of FUSE which provides 
the same API as lufs (thereby allowing you to load lufs modules into fuse). It 
does not actually rely on any part of lufs.
As for captive, I don't think its worth the effort. It has severe memory 
problems and Linux-NTFS development is going quite fast anyway.
