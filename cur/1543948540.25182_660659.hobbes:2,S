That is a special case of the proposed solution. You could mlock the 
regions of interest. Those can then only be migrated but not swapped out.
However, I think we need some limit on the number of pages one can mlock. 
Otherwise the VM can get into a situation where reclaim is not possible 
because the majority of memory is either mlocked or pinned by I/O etc.
