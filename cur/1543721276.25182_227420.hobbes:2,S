Subject: calling kthread_create() from interrupt thread

I'm working on a driver that needs to create threads that can sleep/block
for an indefinite period of time.
    . Can kthread_create() be called from an interrupt handler?
    . Is the cost of a kthread's creation/demise low enough so that one
      can, as often as needed, create a kthread that performs a simple
      function and exits?  Or is the cost too high for this?
Thanks,
Dean
