It's actually a really good idea to add them .. I've noticed they tend
to make my kernels smaller, although I wouldn't expect that to always be
the case.. Another reason is that in -mm we can track how often this
condition is triggered with likely profiling. With kfree, for instance,
there were a number of callers that frequently called kfree(NULL), which
IMO isn't good.
