It is possible to isolate the invalidate to mappings of the newly
broken cowlink only.
There is still the problem of MAP_LOCKED, or more realistically
mlockall() used with mappings of glibc etc. on a filesystem snapshot
made using cowlinks.  The easiest thing is obviously to break the
cowlink when a mapping is locked, but it's not nice.
