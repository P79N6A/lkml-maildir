Certainly I know power cycling fixes it. That's what I've been doing so far.

There's nothing the driver can do to reset the drive or get back to a known
good protocol state?
The "ATA: abnormal status 0x59 on port 0xEFE7" makes me think it's just the
driver getting out of sync with the drive. But i guess that would be hard to
distinguish from the drive just going south.
Certainly if I had backups I would long since have given up on this. And I've
already managed to recover the most important stuff from the drive. At this
point I'm still missing some stuff I would like to be able to recover as much
as I can from.
But I'm mostly just interested in helping ensure the driver handles this case
as well as it can. Ideally it should printk errors and return i/o errors to
user-space but reset as necessary and still allow reading good blocks as much
as possible.
