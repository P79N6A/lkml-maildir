As an aside to this sort of problem, shouldn't we print some kind of 
loud message in dmesg when we force a high-UDMA-capable device down to 
UDMA33 due to a 40-wire cable detection? In the case where it truly is a 
40-wire cable the user may want to know that and replace the cable, if 
it isn't it gives more of a hint of why the drive isn't running at full 
speed..
