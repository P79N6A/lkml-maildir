Outside suggestions to "improve" Linus's workflow usually fall upon deaf
ears...
IMO to accomplish your goals, set up a test box with BitKeeper,
constantly pulling and testing the latest 2.5.x BK trees.  If they
crash, send full info to lkml.
Enough crash messages, and people will know automatically whether or not
the kernel is good... and Linus didn't have to be bothered at all.
