Al,
This is going to be a continuing problem for non-Unix file systems like
NTFS and NWFS that rely on the ability to read and write variable length
sector runs.  At some point, the AIO subsystem needs to get fixed.  I
submitted a patch based on Linus' suggestion that the check in
ll_rw_block() be removed to allow folks to chain variable length sector
requests.  After I did, half the disk drivers seemed to croak and
break.  I doubt 2.4 could be changed, but 2.5 needs this or it's going
to keep biting.  The whole buffer head chaining crap is too memory
intensive.
How about
<disk, starting sector, sector count, callback> for the request? 
Forcing us to use a 512 byte block size sucks up tons of memory and
creates too much overhead to get high performance numbers.  I notice
very significant performance differences when using 512 blocks in NWFS
and EXT2 with 1024 and 4K block sizes.
