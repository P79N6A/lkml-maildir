Xorg's priority is only part of the problem.  Every client that needs a
substantial quantity of cpu while a hog is running will also need to be
negative nice, no?

(Hmm.  What's overload in a multi-tasking multi-threaded world?  I'm
always going to have more tasks available than cpus at some time.  With
KDE, seems to be the norm any time I poke a button)

I see interactivity regression with both X and client at nice -10 in the
presence of any cpu hog load.  Maybe a bug lurks.  Maybe it's fairness.
