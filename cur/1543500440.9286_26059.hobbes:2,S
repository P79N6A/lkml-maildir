	OK. I'm taking the 'implementation dependent' as permission to
make it atomic. It's more sensible behaviour and we can trivially do it
(moreover, doing it that way makes SMP-safe version much easier). So if
doing the thing atomic is not prohibited I'll go for it. Clearly program
can't *rely* on (heavily timing-dependent) race taking place ;-) So that
will not break anything.
