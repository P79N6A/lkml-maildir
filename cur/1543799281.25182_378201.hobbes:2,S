Yes, I think the common case is that built-in _does_ work. I certainly 
have used sound that way. This one case is a bit special just because it's 
not under the sound/ directory, but I suspect that may be true of some USB 
sound"cards" too. 
Now, hot-plug devices tend to have a stronger case for being built as 
modules, although even there I personally actually end up just building in 
the devices I have (whether cardbus cards or things like the USB
printer/mouse/keyboard).
So I don't think sound is terminally broken here, just a few small details 
that it gets wrong that causes some odder drivers to not like being built 
in.
