Because the amount of free swap shrinks continously with mmaped memory
being touched. If I understood the concept of mmap correctly the system
should buffer read/writes to the mapped memory location with real RAM
and page out to the file.
My problem actually is that although I have enough memory to buffer the
whole area the kernel decides to hit hard on the disc which makes the
performance suck.
