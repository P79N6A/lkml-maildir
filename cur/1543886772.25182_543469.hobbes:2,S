I think it's precisely what we want to do in case the randomize_va_space 
is set to 1, don't we? (I haven't yet gone throught the patch though, so I 
am not sure whether this is the case).
We already have stack randomization and mmap() base randomization but 
executable base randomization (which is of course only feasible for -pie 
executables) and brk() randomization still seem to be missing to make it 
complete.
