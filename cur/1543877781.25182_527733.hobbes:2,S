Is major 204 minor 192 already allocated?
Few weeks ago, I sent a patch to allocate 192...199 for other serial
driver (Subject: [PATCH 2.6.21-rc3] serial: Allocate minor device
numbers for serial_txx9 driver):
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/13/246
And it is already in -mm tree since 2.6.21-rc4-mm1.  I just CC-ed the
patch to device@lanana.org, but I really do not know how "master"
devices.txt updated finally.  If I should take some further action to
lanana.org or someone, please let me know.  Thank you.
