That seems more like a case of "hard drives being pointless
for people wanting to store their data" ;)
The disks which _do_ store your data right also tend to work
great with journaling; in fact, they tend to work better with
journaling if you make a habit of crashing your system by
hacking the kernel...
The article you point to seems more like a "if you value your
data, don't use IBM DTLA" thingy.
