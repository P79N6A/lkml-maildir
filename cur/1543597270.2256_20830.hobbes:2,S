That wouldn't help, would it, if >1 data sectors were being written.
The fault mode of a sector simply not being written seems like a real 
weak point of both RAID-1 and RAID-5. Not that RAID-5 parity ever 
gets checked, I think, under normal circumstances, nor RAID-1 mirrors 
get compared, but if they were check and there was an parity or 
mirror-compare error and no other indication of a fault (eg CRC), 
there's no way to recover correct data.
