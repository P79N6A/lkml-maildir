Thanks for the (necessary!) clarification.
Let me point out that the usual process would be to replace
	freezer_exempt(current);
	for (;;) {
		...;
by
	freezer_exempt_for_io(current);
	for (;;) {
		try_to_freeze();
		...;
when or after freezer_exempt_for_io was implemented.
But as it was submitted now, we are temporarily left with
	freezer_exempt(current);
	for (;;) {
		try_to_freeze();  /* useless irritating no-op */
		...;
without any benefit.  (And this explanatory comment ^^^ wasn't even
added; we only have the git log as explanation.)
As subsystem maintainer I have to trust now that "soon" actually means
"soon" and not "RSN"; otherwise my responsibility would be to send a NAK.
