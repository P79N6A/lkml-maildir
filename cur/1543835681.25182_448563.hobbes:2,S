Right.

Right!

How did you compare?

Plus a, lets say, less than cooperative overall attitude, and a marked
tendency to try to sneak changes in by political arm-twisting.

You are wrong. ReiserFS has no "right" to be allowed into the kernel. If
the people in charge of maintaining the filesystem infrastructure of the
kernel say something about your patches, you either take heed (and so
increase your chance of being accepted someday), or stay out. It is /their/
game, after all.

That has to be done regardless. Buggy code with authors that can't be
bothered to fix it just means more work for the (thinly spread) kernel
hackers, so it is an absolute no-no-no.
