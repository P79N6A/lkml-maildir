What dentry->d_mountpoint?  No such thing...
Note that we can't get vfsmount by dentry - that's the point of having these
guys in the first place.  So I'm not sure what you are trying to do here -
dentry + inode is definitely not enough to attach any vfsmounts anywhere.
That's not about namespaces - same fs mounted in several places will give
the same problem - one dentry, many vfsmounts.  And we obviously *can't*
have one vfsmount for all of them - if the same fs is mounted on /foo and
/bar, we will have the same dentry for /foo/splat and /bar/splat.  So
what should we get for /foo/splat/. and /bar/splat/.?  Same dentry *and*
same vfsmount?  I'd expect .. from the former to give /foo and from the
latter - /bar...
