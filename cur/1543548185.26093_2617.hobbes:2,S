The first oops is the important one in this case, some code has taken a
branch to invalid storage.  The second oops is the kernel trying to
print the code fro9m the first oops and gives no useful data.
You need to capture and decode the first oops.  Compile a kernel with a
serial console and capture the oops log on a second machine.  See
linux/Documentation/{serial-console.txt,oops-tracing.txt} on a recent
2.4 kernel.  Also upgrade ksymoops for 2.4.
