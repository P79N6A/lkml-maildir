To use spinlock we would need to used the __raw_ types . As Hua
explained all of the vanilla spinlock calls use the unlikely macro. The
result is that we end up using atomic operations. So using them directly
seems like the cleanest method .
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "release consistency" ?
