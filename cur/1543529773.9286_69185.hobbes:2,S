holding multiple spinlocks does increase the current->spinlock_depth twice
(for clarity: it's not the same as current->lock_depth) - but the cost
(lets say ~2 cycle) is going to be dwarfed by the cost of the LOCK;
operations alone (~20-40 cycles). The variable is on the current process's
stack page so there is not going to be any cachemiss, and in the typical
case there is not going to be any branch miss either.
but yes, it's some overhead, so this thing is going to be optional. Also,
there is no problem optimizing the above as:
	inc_preemption_depth();
 	__spin_lock(&lru_list_lock)
 	__spin_lock(&hash_table_lock);
	[...]
 	__spin_unlock(&hash_table_lock);
 	__spin_unlock(&lru_list_lock)
	dec_preemption_depth();
(where __spin variants are the ones without the preemption control bits)  
- if we want to make it explicit - but i dont think we want that, at least
initially.
