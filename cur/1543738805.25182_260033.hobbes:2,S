Yes.  The workqueue thread will invoke the mid-layer function,
which will do a queuecommand, which will return to the mid-layer,
which will then SLEEP waiting for the command to complete,
which will sleep that workqueue thread.
As part of the interrupt processing to complete the command in the LLD,
it is possible that schedule_work may be necessary, requiring that
a workqueue thread be run.  If this means the same thread that is
already sleeping courtesy of the mid-layer, then we could have a problem.
