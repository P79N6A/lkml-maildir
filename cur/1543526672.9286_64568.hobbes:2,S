Should already be done.  If the region is NOT ioremap'd right now, it is
a bug.

I disagree.  We either need to follow Linus' advice (hope and pray
accessing 0xA0000 is ok), or we need to implement a more flexible way of
arbitrating resource sharing of the VGA regions.  Adding a hack flag to
the resource system is not a good short-term nor long-term fix, IMHO.
