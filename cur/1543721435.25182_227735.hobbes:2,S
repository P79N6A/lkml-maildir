I think your requriement is the core requirement that we were tackling, and
the tracking for fork/exec was more of a feature creap thing.
So far suggestions include...
PAGG: never heard of it, but will look into it
LTT: I think this will cause too much overhead from all the hooks that
     we don't need, but we need to verify this.
Auditing:  Working on some very simple examples to understand how to use
           this correctly, and to understand if this is good enough, or if
           there are some modifications that could be made that would make it
           fit this very limited use of auditing.
