PS - There is also the fact that I am filtering out any "/" characters
just in case someone makes an attempt at doing nasty stuff with the
program name or the host name.
BTW - are you looking at merging this into your tree (2.5 and/or 2.4)?
I belive I can continue doing the patching here but it would be nice
to have this generally available as some people (consulting clients of mine)
don't want to run kernels that I build but only ones from RedHat...
