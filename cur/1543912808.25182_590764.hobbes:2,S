Ehrm, you want everyone who wants to start a new thread to:
 - send an email
 - await response from the mail server
 - send the same email again as a reply to the first one
Did I get that right? If so, good luck running from anyone who doesn't
send his patch series as a bunch of replies to a 00/XX message.
Although it would likely be fun to see the next guy that sends a 600
emails patch bomb getting buried alive in "Please confirm that you want
to create a new thread" emails.
