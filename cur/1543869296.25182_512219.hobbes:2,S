Here's a curious code I found in drivers/input/input.c (2.6.21-rc1):
void input_release_device(struct input_handle *handle)
{
....
	if (handle->handler->start)
		handle->handler->start(handle);
}
Is the above supposed to be this way, or you meant ->stop here?
The commit comment says:
	Input: fix list iteration in input_release_device()
It says me precisely nothing about the way it's supposed ot be, sorry...
