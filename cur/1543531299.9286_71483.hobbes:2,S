Hi everyone!
1.I have installed the patch-2.3.99-pre1/2 and the pre3-3 (trying to get my 
tulip quadport card to work). Now there is some new patches, like 
pre3-4/5/6. I tried to add these but there were some files that got 
rejected. Should these files not be added like "normal" patches, in 
numerical order??
2.All these pre3-X patches, will they form a patch-2.3.99-pre3 patch?
3.Anyone out there thats got a working (tulip.c)quadport card on the     
2.3.51(or later) kernel?
4.I know that Jeff Garzik is working on the tulip drivers, is there      
anyone working/responsible on/for the eepro100.c driver?
TIA
Rikard Westlund
