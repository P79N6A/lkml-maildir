I think you are missing an important point here. Any person who compiles
a kernel image trusts the providers much more than file modes if one is
to run the kernel too so it's not like file modes are killer of trust
here. You might also argue that "NO_ROOT_HOLE=yes make modules_install"
is required for kernel to install non-world-writable modules.
My umask is just fine, 077. Also, as noted, it does make sense
that tar preserves attributes because admins use it for backuping.
