Hi all,
I recently got an E-Mail from Axel Strübing who had the same problem and 
solved it (together with some kernel developpers).
He pointed me to their discussion at 
http://www.spinics.net/lists/usb/msg00694.html
 which included a solution to 
this problem.

this solved my problem too. I tried a case where i copied all mp3 files of my 
mp3 player, formatted it, copied all files back, unmounted, replugged, 
mounted again and did a diff on all files and it was successful.
Therefore it looks like this mp3 player works without problems again.
(i tested with a vanilla kernel 2.6.14).
greetings
