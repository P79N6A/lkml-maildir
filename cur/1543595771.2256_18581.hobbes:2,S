Well, back in the "Going beyond 256 PCI buses" thread two weeks ago when
you argued that Linux not supporting >256 busses was a fallacy...

Yes it is mindless work and is in that patch.  Should we attempt to go
beyond 256 physical busses in 2.4?  Maybe not.  But it is a simple
change and it does work and it works around the existing drivers which
compare busid+devfn for uniqueness when they really should compare
pci_dev pointers.  Should it be redone the correct way (domains) in
2.5?  Absolutely.
The patch does not handle the user mode case.  This leaves the X server
broken.  We could probably weed out busses beyond 256 under
/proc/bus/pci as a workaround -- meaning the video adapter (if any --
rare in these boxes) must be in one of the first I/O drawers.
The added pci_op functions are probably not needed if the code probes
ahead in pcibios_fixup_bus().

Correct.  This is 2.5.
