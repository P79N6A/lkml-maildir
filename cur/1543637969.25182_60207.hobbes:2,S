Done.
Doesn't change anything. Actually I started without any acpi before
The dmesg looks quiet the same just without the acpi stuff.
The machine freezed again after a while. I have another strange effect during 
make which might be related to the same problem. In version  2.4.18 I can 
compile the kernel as I like.
Since 2.4.19-rc3 the machine freezes during compilation. If I use the option 
"make -j" I don't have any problems.
