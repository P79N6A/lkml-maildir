Hello,
Very Interesting news from Massimo...
About the heat source, Mark, i thought about that, too, and hdb is 
always the
bottom (CS Enabled) device of rackmounts (so the colder one) , in front
of the usual ball bearing fans !!!!
I am beginning to believe all this deserves a more deep investigation...
Waiting for comments,
Gianluca
