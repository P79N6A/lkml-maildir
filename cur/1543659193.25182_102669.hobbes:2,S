You could have two independent installations of LILO, one on
sda, and one on sdb, where the latter accesses no files from
sda and defines the disk numbers (for the BIOS) the way they
look when sda is removed.
Then, you probably want to rename /sbin/lilo to /sbin/lilo.bin
or such, and write a script /sbin/lilo that generates the
modified lilo.conf files, and updates both instances of LILO.
