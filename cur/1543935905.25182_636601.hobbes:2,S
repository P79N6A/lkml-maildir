It's irrelevant. I think that condition in driver.c in suspend and resume 
callbacks is invalid, because PNP_DRIVER_RES_DO_NOT_CHANGE means that 
resources should not be changed in the pnp core but only in the driver, 
but in suspend/resume process are resources preserved, so the condition 
should be removed.

    [ALSA] [PATCH] alsa: Improved PnP suspend support
    Also use the PnP functions to start/stop the devices during the suspend so
    that drivers will not have to duplicate this code.
