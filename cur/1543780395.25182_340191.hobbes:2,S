I don't know about sata_sil24 in particular.  In general, there is a
patch in the "libata-dev.git" repository that supports ATA passthru, and
this is scheduled to be merged into the main 2.6.x kernel as soon as
some bugs are fixed.
sata_sil24 definitely needs to support this ATA passthru feature.
As implemented, each SATA driver is simply a generic ATA command engine,
for any command.  struct ata_taskfile (linux/ata.h) has a field that
indicates the command protocol used for command delivery (pio, dma,
no-data, etc.).  Each driver should execute ATA commands based on the
specified ATA protocol.
