Windows will autosuspend hubs, bluetooth devices, HID devices and CDC 
devices, so I think we're safe suspending those by default. I'm not so 
enthusiastic about the "Increase the timeout case" - it doesn't avoid 
any races, just makes them less likely. USB is likely to get loaded in 
the initramfs, but we may not have a full set of udev rules until the 
root fs is up and that can take an effectively arbitrarily large amount 
of time.
