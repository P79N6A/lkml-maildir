Right, the logic to prefer tasks that share the same set of allowable 
nodes as the oom-triggering task is implemented in badness() and being in 
a completely disjoint cpuset does not specifically exclude a task from 
being chosen as the oom killer's victim.  That's because, as you said, it 
could have allocated memory elsewhere before changing cpusets or its set 
of allowable mems.

It's not a bug, it can actually help in a couple instances:
 - a much larger memory hogging task is identified in a disjoint cpuset
   and the liklihood it has allocated memory elsewhere either previously 
   or atomically, or
 - an administrator tunes the oom_adj value for such a task to describe 
   the above behavior even for smaller tasks and their liklihood to 
   allocate outside of their exclusive cpuset.

Yeah, I know.  But the problem with the approach is that it specifies an 
oom priority for both global unconstrained ooms and cpuset-constrained 
ooms.
It's quite possible with your patch to identify an aggregate of tasks that 
should be killed first whenever the system is completely out of memory.  
That's great, and solves your problem.  But that same system cannot 
correctly use cpusets that have the potential to ever oom because your 
patch completely overrides the victim priority and could needlessly kill 
tasks that will not lead to future memory freeing.
That's my objection to the proposal: it doesn't behave appropriately for 
both global unconstrained ooms and cpuset-constrained ooms at the same 
time.
I think if you look at the cgroup oom notifier patch I referred you to, 
you will find it trivial to implement a handler that can issue a SIGKILL 
for an aggregate of tasks and implement the functional equivalent of this 
patch in userspace where it belongs.  It's nearly impossible to code oom 
killer heuristics in the kernel that work for every possible workload and 
configuration without some unfortunate casualties.

I think the heuristic could be tuned to penalize tasks in disjoint cpusets 
a little more, but its implementation as a factor of the badness score is 
actually very well placed.
