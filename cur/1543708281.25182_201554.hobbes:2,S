Linux version 2.2.24 (actually since pivot-root), have a
problem with what's in /proc/mounts vs. what's written
to /etc/mtab when mounting file-systems.
/etc/mtab
/dev/sda1 / ext2 rw 0 0
none /proc proc rw 0 0
none /dev/pts devpts rw,gid=5,mode=620 0 0
none /dev/shm tmpfs rw 0 0
/dev/sdb1 /usr/src ext2 rw 0 0
/proc/mounts
rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0
/dev/root / ext2 rw 0 0
/proc /proc proc rw 0 0
none /dev/pts devpts rw 0 0
none /dev/shm tmpfs rw 0 0
/dev/sdb1 /usr/src ext2 rw 0 0
/etc/issue
Red Hat Linux release 8.0 (Psyche)
Kernel 2.4.24 on a i586
On that system /dev/root doesn't even exist!
Neither does rootfs in any accessible way. Therefore,
the shutdown routine(s) that read /proc/mounts will
fail, leaving improperly dismounted volumes.  Basically,
if I execute `init 0` from the console, everything's
fine, but executing 'reboot' from a network connection
will result in a long fsucking startup.
I think the two unusable entries should not show in
/proc/mounts,
	rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0
	/dev/root / ext2 rw 0 0
That would fix the problem because there is no way to
umount either of them. Try it, `umount rootfs` returns
ENOENT as does `umount /dev/root'`.
Cheers,
