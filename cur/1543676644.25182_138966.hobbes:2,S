There is an internal buffer for this UDP socket. Select() should depend
on it's state.
I heard that SO_SNDLOWAT i SO_RCVLOWAT might be useful in this approach,
but it is not implemented in Linux.
Moreover my example uses AF_UNIX socket and AFAIK this should be
reliable communication.
I don't know why are you taking about network interfaces in this
context?
This quotation is taken from man select:
"
       Three independent sets of descriptors are watched.   Those
       listed  in  readfds  will  be watched to see if characters
       become available for reading (more precisely, to see if  a
       read  will not block - in particular, a file descriptor is
       also ready on end-of-file),  those  in  writefds  will  be
       watched  to  see  if  a write will not block, and those in
       exceptfds will be watched for exceptions."
and this from man socket:
"       Socket creates an endpoint for communication and returns a
       descriptor. "
I'm aware of the fact that my english is rather poor, but I see that
socket returns a descriptor, and select is watching descriptors and
returns descriptors ready for writing if a write operation will not
block.
I would agree with you if my program wouldn't work on Solaris or QNX.
But it works on both and it looks consistent with man!
