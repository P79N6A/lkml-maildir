Well, either glibc can stop using requeue if the mutex is PI mutex (and use
the slower fallback), or kernel would need to handle requeueing from normal to
PI futex.

Not always.
Say if you do:
thread1	(low prio)	thread2 (very high prio)		thread3 (mid prio)
pthread_cond_signal (&cv)
# first use of cv in the program, no mutex has been ever used with this
# condvar
lll_mutex_lock (&cv->__data.__lock)
			pthread_cond_wait (&cv, &pi_mutex)
			lll_mutex_lock (&cv->__data.__lock)
								use_all_CPU
			# Then thread2 is stuck, waiting on thread1 which waits on thread3
At pthread_cond_signal enter time you don't know the type of associated
mutex, so you don't know which kind of internal lock to use.
It doesn't have to be the first use of cv in the program, similarly it can
be any pthread_cond_{signal,broadcast} called while there are no threads
in pthread_cond_*wait on that cv.
