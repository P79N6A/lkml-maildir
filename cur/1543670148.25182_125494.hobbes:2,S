Of course, if cables are pulled out or something like that, I'm not expecting
the OS to recover from that. :-)
I'm not trying to recover from or survive physical configuration changes.
I'm more interested in what happens when a volume generates a temporary
error, such as the ones that sometimes occur when doing logical
configuration changes (BIN-file changes on Symmetrix, for example).

I'm not sure, but that doesn't apply to us anyway since we have a 8530.
Anyway, I'll take a look at the SCSI_TIMEOUT value. Thanks for your
suggestions.
