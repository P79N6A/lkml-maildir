Having it bounce between cpu's would likely result in a lower performance anyway: you 
really want it bound to a single CPU to benefit from cache hits on the various involved 
data structs that are needed to receive the data from hardware, do accounting etc.
the userspace irq balance daemon attempts to keep network interrupts on the same cpu for 
longer periods. The old obsolete kernel-space daemon did exactly the opposite completely 
destroying network performance.
I'm not sure whether this is completely optimal on newer chips like conroe with large 
shared caches though...
