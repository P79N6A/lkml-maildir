   I just tried it on 2.2.17 and 2.4.0test11 and it sets PUSH for
   writev() for both cases just fine. Maybe you could supply a test
   program and tcpdump logs for what you think is wrong ?
One thing which could affect the behavior is if the Zeus
folks are futzing around with the TCP_CORK socket option.
Ben, are you guys playing with it?
Finally, are you doing these writes from a userspace program
or directly inside of a kernel module?
Later,
