I tried 2.4.19-pre1-ac2 and I still get the disk hang.  Fortunately
with this kernel the machine did not hang, but all reading and writing
from the disk stopped.  I could still use sysrq, but I am not sure
what information would be useful to gather.
What utilities would be useful to keep on a tmpfs filesystem, for
diagnostic use when the disk freezes?
