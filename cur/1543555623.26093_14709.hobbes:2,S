For bad sector management I use an old EISA 486 also equipped with
a 2740 card, this one show the same behaviour when I run scsifmt
under DOS and get an old drive with incorrect termination or a bad
controller. Have to switch everything off, even the RESET switch
won't help. I'd blame the BIOS only.
BTW, the built in SCSI utilities are buggy - one cannot rescan the bus...
Are there still upgrades (EISA is meant to be upgradeable) floating
around?
