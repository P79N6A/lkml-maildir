The name is pretty confused.  smp_wmb seems to imply an SMP-only 
barrier, whereas we want here a write barrier on regular memory.  Both 
smp_wmb and wmb() are identical in that they both reduce to barrier 
today, but I confess not to know which one semantically is correct.  
Your call on this patch - it is unecessary, I thought it was more 
semantically correct, but you probably know that better than me.  So, 
drop part 2 of this patch?
