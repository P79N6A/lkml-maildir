Hi,
Looks like the onboard CLE266 chip is not yet recognized
by the kernel:
Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 381M
agpgart: Unsupported Via chipset (device id: 3123), you might want to 
try agp_try_unsupported=1.
agpgart: no supported devices found.
