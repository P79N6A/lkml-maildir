As I replied to Julia off-list -- the math I and others have given is
correct, but assumes we're dealing with real-typed values. However, we
only have integer types in the kernel, meaning the divisions truncate.
Thus, while mathematically equivalent, the simplification is not
computationally so.

Nish
