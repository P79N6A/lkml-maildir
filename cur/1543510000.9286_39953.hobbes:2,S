    Andi> Why is this strange?
Maybe I did not make describe the scenario clearly enough. I meant it
would be strange if
- device uses the default (sch_generic) packet scheduler
- tx_queue_len is ifconfigŽed to a very low value while the device
  queue is empty
- after that a large transfer is started
- during this transfer netstat show large amounts of data in the queues.
