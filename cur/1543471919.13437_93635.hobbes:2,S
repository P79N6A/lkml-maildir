True, but here we are referring to the xchg between registers, and more
specifically the short form xchg[wl] (0x90 to 0x97 opcode, exchanging
%[e]ax with any other of the "general purpose" registers) which do not
imply bus operation nor any locking whatsoever. Even the long form won't
perform any locking if you don't use any memory operands (xchgb %ah,%al
has no short form for example).
