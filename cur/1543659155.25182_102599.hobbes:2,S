Now, it's provable you never *NEED* a goto.  On the other hand, *judicious*
use of goto can prevent code that is so cluttered with stuff of the form:
        if(...) {
		...
		die_flag = 1;
		if (!die _flag) {...
		
Pretty soon, you have die_1_flag, die_2_flag, die_3_flag and so on,
rather than 3 or 4 "goto bail_now;".
The real problem is that C doesn't have a good multi-level "break" construct.
On the other hand, I don't know of any language that has a good one - some
allow "break 3;" to break 3 levels- but that's still bad because you get
screwed if somebody adds an 'if' clause....
