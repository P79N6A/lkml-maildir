I would agree that the identification is far more useful in 2.4, but it
still takes the same number of IRQ.
Could I ask why the usage information has been de-clarified without
starting a flame war on the politics of the change? I assume there's a
good reason for not just identifying the usage to those who haven't
memorized the PC interrupt defaults.
