What optimisations? gcc already does most of the things you need a
barrier/volatile for, like reordering non-dependant loads and stores,
and eliminating mem ops completely by caching in registers.

OK. Well I also wasn't saying that ACCESS_ONCE should not be
implemented. But if we want something like it, then it would make
sense to have an equivalent barrier statement as well (ie. order()).
