I guess I see what you are getting at. If a user has read/write access 
to /views/sysadmin/etc/shadow and if that is an alias for /etc/shadow, then 
of course it doesn't help to give the user only read access to /etc/shadow to 
protect that file. So you can shoot yourself in the foot with mounts, and 
also with hardlinks. That's why confined processes are not allowed to mount 
stuff, and why hardlinks requires the appropriate profile permissions.
AppArmor depends on the namespace so it cares about namespace manipulations,  
just like SELinux depends on labels so labels matter there.

Read it like this: we don't have a good idea how to support multiple 
namespaces so far. Currently, we interpret all pathnames relative to the 
namespace a process is in. Confined processes don't have the privilege to 
create or manipulate namespaces, which makes this safe. We may find a better 
future solution.

I'm not aware of situations where giving different permissions to different  
paths to the same file would actually be useful. The security model doesn't  
prevent it though, and it's not a security hole.
