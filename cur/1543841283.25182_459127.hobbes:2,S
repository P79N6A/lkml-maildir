Oh well, this doesn't explain why it is so, but i suppose you know what you
speak about.

Indeed, in the initrd era, the ramdisk was initialized too late for this kind
of stuff, but it was one of the features of the initramfs ramdisks to
initialize it earlier, which made firmware loading possible.

Well, there is userspace and userspace.

Yep, but initramfs is initialized ways earlier than normal userspace.

Ok.

Ok.

Are you sure of this ? This is somewhat contrary to what i have heard, and it
sure would make sense to be able to access the initramfs ramdisk much earlier.

Indeed, and it seems to me that exactly this kind of use was indeed considered
when the initramfs infrastructure was designed. Not sure about the latest bit
concerning hotplug though.

Yeah, well, if it is just cated at the end of the kernel, it would be rather
minimal.

Indeed.

Well, since debian moved to 2.6 kernels on powerpc, i have been using ramdisks,
and let me assure you that from a distribution point of view, it is way more
elegant and nice than the non-ramdisk solution.
