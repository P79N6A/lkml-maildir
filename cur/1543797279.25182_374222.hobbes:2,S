Backtraces? X version? X config?
(FWIW, my AGP Radeon 9250 works flawlessly as of X.org 6.8.99.901.
6.8.2 and earlier were wobbly.)
Whether performance is appalling I don't know because I don't have any
standards to measure it by, but I get 2000fps or thereabouts out of
glxgears. That's a hell of a lot better than the 64fps I got out of
my earlier mach64 :)

Agreed. If you can handle a brief possibility of deadlocking then you
can get a backtrace when X dies, which is very useful:
