Hello,
Dunno if this has been mentioned already, but I have an interesting glitch 
with speedtouch DSL modem. When i compile the driver as module, it says 
registered driver speedtouch, but can not access the device.
However, when i compile the driver in, everything works smoothly and nicely.
If you need some more testing/information do not hesitate to contact me.
Thanks in advance.
