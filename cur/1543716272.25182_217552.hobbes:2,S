Speaking of per-process data, one of the classification engines of 
CKRM called crbce, implemented as a module, allows per-process data to 
be  sent to userland.  crbce in particular, exports data on the delays 
   seen by processes in a) waiting for cpu time after being runnable 
b) page fault service time c) io service time etc. (getting the data 
requires another kernel patch)....so per-process data needs can be met 
through CKRM, though that is not the intent or main objective of the 
project.

This is true if one is only interested in data gathering or 
coarse-grain control. One could monitor per-process stats and fiddle 
with each process' rlimits (assuming all the ones needed are 
available) and achieve coarse-grain group control.
But if processes leave and join process groups  rapidly, you need the 
schedulers and the core kernel to be aware of the groupings and 
schedule resources accordingly.
In CKRM, the premise is that the privileged user defines the way 
processes get grouped and could do so in a way that leads to rapid 
changes in group membership. So having group control/monitoring 
policies implemented as an externally loaded module (not talking of 
scheduler modifications as modules, which is a no-no)  is not a 
palatable option.
