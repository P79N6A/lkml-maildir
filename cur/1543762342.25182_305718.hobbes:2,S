yeah, sounds good - but i'd not make any distinction between RT and 
non-RT tasks - just make the rule #3 distinction based on ->prio. In 
particular on UP a task should only run when its higher prio, so if a 
lock is 'partially owned' then the priority rule should always be true.  
(On SMP it's a bit more complex, there the priority rule could make a 
real difference.)
