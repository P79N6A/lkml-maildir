Indeed. I realized after I sent the previous mail that I had missed the
flags save/restore in switch_to :-(
Still, does this mean that there is some micro optimization opportunity in
the lcall7/lcall27 handlers to remove the popfl? After all TF is now
handled by some magic in do_debug unless I miss (again) something,
NT has become irrelevant, and cld in SAVE_ALL takes care of DF.
In short something like the following (I just love patches which only
remove code):

Yeah, sorry for the noise.

That was too easy since I did originally suggest the push/pop sequence :-)
