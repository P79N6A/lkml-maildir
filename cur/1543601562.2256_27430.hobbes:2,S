It works fine on the KX133 chipset that is on the Abit KA7 motherboard.  So, 
i for one have not applied the patch.

the only way it'll get a good sampling is to put it in the kernel 
I suggest not adding this to the "athlon" cpu selection code.  Rather make it 
a sub-option like many other drivers have.  That way people can select 
whether they need it or not until we are sure it's totally safe for everyone 
to use it by Via saying so or something.   Just a suggestion, other drivers 
do the same thing, so why not the cpu selection screen for workarounds.
