Yes, Xen can use this interface, even without modification to Xen.  The 
interface was used successfully to run a VMI kernel on Xen 2.0.  As it 
stands now, the interface does need to change a bit to accomodate Xen 
3.0 - but it is possible to do.  Rather than wait until we have a 
working prototype of that, we thought the interface itself warrants 
discussion now.

We could.  But it is our opinion that the Xen interface is unnecessarily 
complicated, without a clean separation between the layer of interaction 
with the hypervisor and the kernel proper.  The interface we propose we 
believe is more powerful, and more conducive to performance 
optimizations while providing significant advantages - most 
specifically, a single binary image that is properly virtualizable on 
multiple hypervisors and capable of running on native hardware.
