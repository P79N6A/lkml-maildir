Sorry Jeff, your patch does not apply on 2.6.23-mm1. The 'struct file'
removal from reiserfs_xattr_ function is already in -mm
(make-reiserfs-stop-using-struct-file-for-internal.patch).
The Dave's patch I was refering to is this one: 
==== BEGIN =====
The bug is caused by reiserfs creating a special 'struct file' with a
NULL vfsmount.  
/* Opens a file pointer to the attribute associated with inode */
static struct file *open_xa_file(const struct inode *inode, const char
*name,
                                 int flags)
{
...
        fp = dentry_open(xafile, NULL, O_RDWR);
        /* dentry_open dputs the dentry if it fails */
As Christoph just said, this is somewhat of a bandaid.  But, it
shouldn't hurt anything.

Dave sent it privately to me... I guess this "bandaid" is no longer
needed now, is it?
