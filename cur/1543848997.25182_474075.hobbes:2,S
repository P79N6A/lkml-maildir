The thing about disks is that it's not as easy as giving the process 10%
of the io requests issued. Only if the considered bandwidth is random
load will that work, but that's not very interesting.
You need to say 10% of the disk time, which is something CFQ can very
easily be modified to do since it works with time slices already. 10%
doesn't mean very much though, you need a timeframe for that to make
sense anyways. Give me 100msec every 1000msecs makes more sense.
