I confirmed two modules.
[dyky@kyasca ~]$ sudo /sbin/depmod -a
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.2.18-0.01601fb/misc/e100.o
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
/lib/modules/2.2.18-0.01601fb/pcmcia/nin_cs.o
e100.o is network module provided by Intel. I used version 1.3.14. The
second nin_cs.o is for PCMCIA-CS SCSI card. It's located in
ftp://projects.sourceforge.net/pub/pcmcia-cs/contrib/NinjaSCSI3-1.0.2.tar.gz.
