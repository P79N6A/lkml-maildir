Is this a joke, or are you simply bored? Rather than marking it
subscriber's only like every other entry, you opt to remove the only
mailing list listed as a contact point for a given architecture? And this
is constructive how?
If anything, this should be changed to linuxsh-dev@lists.sourceforge.net,
since that's been the defacto standard list for quite a long time now,
and is what I thought was in there now, in addition to the m17n.org list
as a fallback. Should I assume that this was also removed by a similar
"constructive" change?
