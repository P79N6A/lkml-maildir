As a 3com Impact IQ modem owner, I feel that I can safely say that the
Linux kernel version has nothing to do with channel bonding in the
modem.  Indeed, since it is an external modem, there is little that the
Linux kernel can do to cause the modem to bond or not bond channels.  It
is strictly a modem configuration issue.
Note that most UARTS will max out at 115200 bps, so the full 128K
bandwidth cannot be realized without a faster UART.  But this also has
nothing to do with channel bonding.
Most likely the reason it works under NT is that your NT application
software knows how to configure the "S registers" to tell the modem how
to bond channels.  You will need to do this by hand.  In my case, I set
up the modem, and then uses "AT&W" to save the settings permanently so
that they are always in effect.  If you read your fine manual, you will
see the settings you should apply.
