Which means, it prevents me from giving access to /dev/kmem to an

What exactly is PF_SUPERPRIV good for? I see no real use in the
source. There is exactly one test for this flag (kernel/acct.c:336),
then sets another flag (ASU), which in turn is used nowhere else.
So, I think we could get rid of this flag as well. Comments?
