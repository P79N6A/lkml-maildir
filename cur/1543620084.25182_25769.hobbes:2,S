No. Even if you decompress the image you can't list the .o files. The
decompressed image is not an archive (created with ar). It is a raw binary
file generated by objcopy.
Anyway, if you still want to decompress it, the gzip'ed parts does not
start from the beginning. In front of the kernel image might be a boot
sector and some other code for decompressing it, video initialization etc.
Look after the gzip signature (0x1F 0x8B I think) in your bzImage file.
Cut the data before this and use "gzip -d" to decompress it.

IANAL but I don't think so, there is no code from it to compile and
include in the kernel image. It just defines what the image contains.
