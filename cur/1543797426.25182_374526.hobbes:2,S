If libata knows how to talk to the random hardware attached to a Dell 
laptop hotswap bay, I'll be amazed. Ejecting the drive generates a 
system management interrupt, which then causes the ACPI code to check a 
register in a block of machine-specific registers and generate an ACPI 
notification. As far as I can tell, the controller has no say in the 
matter at all - the Intel specs seem to suggest that ICH6 doesn't 
generate a hotswap interrupt unless you're using AHCI (which this 
hardware doesn't).
So, as far as I can tell, there /is/ ACPI-specific magic on 
current-generation hardware. If we're lucky, they'll move to AHCI in 
future and implement things properly there - but I wouldn't count on it.
