Hi Andrew.
* list_replace_rcu-2.6.9-rc2.patch
This attached patch adds list_replace_rcu() to include/linux/list.h
for atomic updating operations according to RCU-model.
void list_replace_rcu(struct list_head *old, struct list_head *new)
The 'old' element is detached from the linked list, and the 'new'
element is inserted to the same point of the linked list concurrently.
This patch is necessary for the performance improvement of SELinux.
See,
