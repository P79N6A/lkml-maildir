No problem.  I am cc:ing lkml in case anyone else shares this problem,

Our current best known 2.4.x setup is Suse 7.2 with stock 2.4.16 with 
Oracle 8.1.7, running large tablespaces (i.e. temp, rbs, large 
data/index tablespaces) on rawio over LVM over RAID10.  The performance 
seems adequate; unfortunately due to the differing workloads I do not 
have exact numbers on 2.2.x vs 2.4.16.  I haven't tried 2.2.x on this 
server yet due to boot problems.  I originally thought it a kernel 
issue, but it turns out that the "2.2.x problem" was Oracle bogosity:  
Oracle was creating core dump directories 50000+ levels deep upon 
startup, running the machine out of VM/file descriptors in the process 
(indicated by e.g. "/bin/ls: permission denied" messages even when 
logged in as root), from which 2.2.20suse could not recover (2.4.16 
handled it adequately).  So I guess I should try 2.2.x for comparison 
and report the results, although I am rather reluctant to reboot a 
production box now that we've got a stable 2.4.x.
What is your workload like?  It seems that with RAID5 you might be doing 
mostly read-only transactions?  Our workload is mostly data warehousing, 
with the (large) difference that we do bulk updates (in the millions of 
rows) on previously loaded data.  I am curious if the slowdowns we have 
experienced only affect massively write-bound Oracle instances.  Also, 
are the number of RAID arrays and the tablespace layout the same across 
the two boxes?
