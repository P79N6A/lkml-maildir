I don't see that they differ.  If the software can be replaced, the
manufacturer ought to tell you how to do it.  It doesn't have to do it
for you, it doesn't have to give you the hardware tools needed to do
it, but if you're not able to start from the source code and the
information provided by the manufacturer and get to a modified version
of the software on the device, while the manufacturer could do it,
then the manufacturer is locking you in, and therefore you're not
free.  This is a clear violation of the spirit of the license, even if
the legalese might make room for some such misbehavior.
