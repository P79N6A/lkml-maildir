OK, thanks.  I'm a little reluctant to move this box to 2.4 yet (before Monday
we had almost a year's uptime out of it- frequent reboots are frowned upon),
but looking at the 2.4 source, the relevant bits of fs/proc/array.c and
include/linux/kernel.h look exactly the same, so the problem could be there as
well.
Am I being dumb?
