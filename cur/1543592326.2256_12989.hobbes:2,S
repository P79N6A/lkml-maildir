You mean a double fault.  #SS is only called when there is a limit
violation on the stack segment or the stack segment is not present.  I
guess you could get a limit violation if it tried to wrap around below
0, but you would get a page fault first.  An unmapped page will always
cause a page fault, but since the stack is still invalid, it would then
cause a double fault.
