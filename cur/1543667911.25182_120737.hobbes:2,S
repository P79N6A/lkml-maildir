Please send me a copy.  I'd like to get all the required bits and pieces for
this conversion queued up in one place so we can actually look at it,
evaluate its impact and test it.  The current process of creeping revelations

Also if userspace tools need upgrading please send me the URLs so I can make
people well aware of the upgrade requirements and process.
Thanks.
