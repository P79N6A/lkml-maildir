Hi,
Can anyone please tell me who's administering the kernel bugzilla now?
I've tried to write to bugme-admin@linux-foundation.org , but this address seems
to point to nowhere.
The problem is that I'd like to have a new component called
"Hibernation-Suspend" in the kernel bugzilla's "Power Management" category and
bug reports with this component selected to be assigned to me automatically.
Greetings,
Rafael
