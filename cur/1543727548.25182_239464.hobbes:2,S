Greetings,
i'm running 2.6.8-rc3 at the moment, and got the following in my logs after i started X (v. 4.4.0).
before starting X everything is alright.
this problem is present like 2.6.8-rc1. (maybe 2.6.7* too, i dont remember). sorry.

this is with ACPI Debug.
without i get the following:
atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program, like XFree86, might be trying access hardware directly.

this looks like a problem with the battery status to me.
but the output of /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/state and /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/info looks ok to me.
if you need any other information or output, please let me know.
dmesg output is attached. (with ACPI debug digabled)
the maschine is an acer travelmate 291lci laptop.
thanks, sebastian
