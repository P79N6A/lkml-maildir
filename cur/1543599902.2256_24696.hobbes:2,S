If you are still seeing the problem then yes try noapic, but also let
me know if its happening with current kernels. The apic has multiple effects
and not all of them are necessarily hardware issues at all
The big one is that interrupts can get delayed and become much more 
asynchronous which can obviously have impacts on driver races
