Hello,
I can confirm now that the above patch work,
First as I said I did try to suspend with this patch and without XFS, and it did work,
Now I reverted it and now system still suspends correctly without xfs module loaded ( I didn't tell you that i use now ext3,
and that I generally compile everything in kernel, so i put XFS too, because I used it once, and I still have a XFS disk image)
But system hangs with XFS loaded, so this patch works.
Regards,
	Maxim Levitsky
