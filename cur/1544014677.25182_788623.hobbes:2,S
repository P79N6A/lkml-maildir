Yes, your analysis appears correct.

That will bust any other hardware that tries to share the interrupt. If 
a driver requests the interrupt without IRQF_SHARED, nothing else can 
request that interrupt line.

Yeah, that's the proper fix.

Presumably nobody uses it with CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ, that option wouldn't 
normally be used on non-debug kernels..
