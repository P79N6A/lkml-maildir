Yes - We had those errors to:
"Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempting to free lock with active block list"
- on 2.6.10 on the webservers, which was fixed with that particular patch. But 
this is a different error as our mailservers dont't act as NFS clients. All 
use local XFS.
Sad thing is that the mailservers crashes every 10-20 hours on 2.6.x, but I'm 
not able to reproduce it in a test environment, and at time of original post 
to LKML noone was able to do anything about it without a reproduceable 
testcase. :(

OK, as far as i remember, we had the same messages in the kernel log when 
running with SMP.
