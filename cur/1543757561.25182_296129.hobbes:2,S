Well, on my IBM ThinkPad T42p (ATI FireGL T2 128MB), I can resume with
both I2C modules loaded, so probably the problem is not specific to
the I2C subsystem.

I just tested two USB devices after S3 resuming without having removed
the USB modules (uhci-hcb and ehci-hcd):
- Logitech USB Wheel Mouse (046d:c00c, USB 1.x), it works with no
  problem on console, but not on X (this was caused by the fact that
  I've two corepointer on my XF86Config-4, in fact after having
  corrected this error and restarted X, the USB mouse works)
- Mitsubishi Chemical 2.5" HD Case (05e3:0702, USB 2.0 [1], with a
  SAMSUNG MP0804H 80GB), it works with no problem :-D

Again, IMHO the problem is specific to your machine: I use the
radeonfb (with acpi_sleep=s3_bios) and the resume is ok (both in
console and Debian XFree86-4.3.0.dfsg.1-11, radeon driver).
Thx, bye,
