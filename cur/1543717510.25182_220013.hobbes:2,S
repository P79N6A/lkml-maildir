Oh, man!  Nested C functions are evil.  Just don't do it.

Nested C functions shouldn't be allowed _anywhere_.  It's the worst
extension that has made it into GNU C.

It has nothing to do with stupidity.  The kernel doesn't support all
the routines provided by libgcc.a.  __ia64_trampoline() is one of
them.
  Stephen> - Do other architectures (sparc, ppc) have similar problems?
It's not a problem.  It's a feature.  It's likely that other
architectures which require a helper-routine from libgcc would behave
the same.
