relayfs allows you to choose which is best for you.
From Documentation/filesystems/relayfs.txt:
...
int    relay_open(channel_path, bufsize, nbufs, channel_flags,
		  channel_callbacks, start_reserve, end_reserve,
		  rchan_start_reserve, resize_min, resize_max, mode,
		  init_buf, init_buf_size)
...
- resize_min - if set, this signifies that the channel is
  auto-resizeable.  The value specifies the size that the channel will
  try to maintain as a normal working size, and that it won't go
  below.  The client makes use of the resizing callbacks and
  relay_realloc_buffer() and relay_replace_buffer() to actually effect
  the resize.
- resize_max - if set, this signifies that the channel is
  auto-resizeable.  The value specifies the maximum size the channel
  can have as a result of resizing.
...
LTT uses fixed-sized channels, but the implementation of printk-
over-relayfs used resize_min and resize_max to allow automatic
sizing (grep for relay_open):

... now I'm going to get some sleep ... I'll catch up later with
further discussion ...
