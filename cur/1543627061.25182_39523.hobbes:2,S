Going through the early setup code is good.  I do this as well,
though I have tried the other route as well.
Reseting the video mode like monte does is questionable.
The basic point though is that the monte kernel interface is not set
up to support anything but the linux kernel.  The bootimg interface
if fairly general, the user space just happens to be a little
immature.
As for skipping the real mode setup code, I prefer to do that cleanly
when it is needed.

Yes that is primarily for linuxbios.  But that is when it is necessary
to skip the real mode setup.  But all you have to do is specify a
mem=xyz line and you also skip the real mode setup, if you feel like
it.

Unless I missed something the Linux kernel won't work on smp though.
It is a matter of resetting the state of the apics, and ensuring you
are running on the first processor.  I don't believe bootimg did/does that.

In general yes.  There are some interesting side effects though.
Going through the pci bus and shutting off bus masters is a good
first approximation of what needs to happen.
In general though (a) there are buggy devices that can hang the system
if you treat the incorrectly.  (b) Sometimes you need to do more than
just shutdown bus master DMA.
Which is why I have for the most part been holding off.

Thanks.  Please holler if you have problems.   I really need
to look at building a debugging strategy for this code.  I have gotten
some failure reports but so far it is hard to track down why any of
it has problems.
