Hi folks!!
   As you know changes to the fbdev api having been going into the dj
tree whcih eventually will go into Linus tree. One of the big changes
will soon be to fbgen.c. It will be reworked. Because of this I need all
people who maintain fbgen based fbdev drivers to work with me to push
forth these changes. I haven't finished the new fbgen just yet. I will be
doing some testing using a the 3Dfx fbdev driver which I have ported over 
to use the new fbdev api. So I also like Hannu Mallat to talk to me as
well. Thank you.
