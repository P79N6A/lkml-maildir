Subject: [patch-2.5.8-pre] swapinfo accounting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

In and around 2.5.7 & 2.5.8-pre2, with a highly stressful
VM workload (akpm's bash-shared-mapping and usemem),
causing lots of swap activity, I see some odd swap info
in /proc/meminfo.
Machine is 8-proc with 16 GB of RAM and 16 GB of swap (1 partition
and 7 files, each 2 GB).
Examples of /proc/meminfo (excerpts):
Before swapping:
MemTotal/Free: 16312504 kB/651340 kB
SwapTotal/Free: 16777088 kB/16777088 kB
After swapping:
MemTotal/Free: 16312504 kB/5092 kB
SwapTotal/Free: 16913332 kB/16777088 kB
Notice how SwapTotal grows and SwapFree never changes.
This isn't correct, is it?
It looks to me like mm/swapfile.c::si_swapinfo()
shouldn't be adding nr_to_be_unused to total_swap_pages
or nr_swap_pages for return in val->freeswap and
val->totalswap.
I.e., total_swap_pages is correct for SwapTotal and
nr_swap_pages is correct for SwapFree...except for
bad blocks accounting (?).
(nr_to_be_unused === nr_swap_pages_in_use)
(nr_swap_pages === nr_free_swap_pages)
And the for-j loop to count nr_to_be_unused is overhead...
Maybe, except for bad blocks accounting.
Here are some samples from the end of si_swapinfo():
swapinfo: nr_swap_pages: 3405953, total_swap_pages: 4194272,
nr_to_be_unused: 788319
swapinfo: nr_swap_pages: 3405537, total_swap_pages: 4194272,
nr_to_be_unused: 788735
swapinfo: nr_swap_pages: 3402977, total_swap_pages: 4194272,
nr_to_be_unused: 791295
Anyway, here is the patch that makes it better.
Not perfect, due to possibility of bad blocks, but better
than it was.   Comments?
