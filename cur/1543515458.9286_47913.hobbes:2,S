In a block device driver's request function, there are now two
functions that one is supposed to call when a request has been
completed: end_that_request_first and end_that_request_last. The former
does the appropriate stuff to mark the buffer_head up to date, end I/O
on it (or adjust the request on error). The latter frees up the request
slot.
I'm writing a block device driver where I'd like to take all the
requests out of the queue and record the relevant buffer_head pointers
elsewhere. I want to end I/O on the buffer_heads asynchronously later
(potentially much later). In other words, I'd like to call
end_that_request_last first (after recording the READ/WRITE commands
and buffer_head pointers) and do the equivalent of
end_that_request_first last, much later. Is this a valid thing to do?
I'm fairly sure it will work but is it the Right Way (TM) to code it
or do I risk it breaking when the buffer_heads get even closer to
being just I/O tags? Also, is emptying the request queue a reasonable
thing to do (since I don't want the system to run out of global
request slots and this block device may be very, very slow)?
