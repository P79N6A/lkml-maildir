I don't see any way of using process groups that would allow
this to work:
$ make-audio-samples | tee foo | bplay
^C
(bplay is 2-threaded for buffering reasons, IIRC)
and which would also let 'bplay' use Posix threads and
their associated signal semantics.  A new clone flag
defining 'signal groups' has the advantage that it lets the
process decide what signal semantics will be applied to it.
