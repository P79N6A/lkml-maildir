Can we reserve the resources when we register the opregion?  Or does
the opregion declaration just not tell us what resources it might use?

I would think the opregion resources should be reserved in connection
with the opregion, not with drivers that use the opregion.

If we know the resources the opregion can use, we can at least
reserve the union of those used by the opregion and by other
PNP devices.  A little messy to deal with overlapping areas, I
agree, but it should still be possible by shrinking the region
or allocating a port at a time or something.

I have a patch for this (see below).  It is risky, and I'm nervous
about it.  But the alternative (leaving PNP devices active but not
reserving their resources, as we do today) is also risky.
If you have a similar patch in the works, I'd like to compare with mine.

You mean the stuff in request_standard_resources()?  I think that's
legacy from before we had PNPBIOS and ACPI.  Theoretically, we should
be able to remove it if we have PNPBIOS or ACPI.  But I think that
would be too dangerous.
It should be safe to leave it -- it's OK if we reserve a little bit
too much.  The problem is if we reserve too little.

PNP: request ioport and iomem resources used by active devices
For platform-type devices, PNP tells us what devices are present, whether
they're active, and what resources they consume.  To prevent conflicts, the
PNP core should request the resources used by active devices before we
assign resources to any other devices.
This overlaps with request_standard_resources(), which requests resources
for a built-in list of "standard PC devices" such as DMA controllers, PICs,
timers, keyboard, etc.  PNP tells us which devices are actually present on
a specific machine.
Sometimes the built-in standard resources are larger than what PNP reports,
or they combine things that PNP reports separately, which makes things look
a little funny:
    0000-001f : dma1		<-- built-in resource includes 2 controllers
      0000-000f : 00:02		<-- PNP reports only one DMA controller
    0020-0021 : pic1
    002e-002f : 00:06
    0040-0043 : timer0
    0050-0053 : timer1
    0060-006f : keyboard	<-- built-in resource groups several things
      0060-0060 : 00:04		<-- PNP reports 8042 controller data register
      0061-0061 : 00:03		<-- PNP reports AT-style speaker
      0064-0064 : 00:04		<-- PNP reports 8042 controller status register
    0070-0073 : 00:06
      0070-0071 : rtc
This doesn't mark the resources busy; they should be marked busy when
a driver claims them.  But if driver attempts to claim a region larger
than what PNP reported, it will fail.
