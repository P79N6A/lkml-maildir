I apparently had too little coffee today...
1. Couldn't find the MAINTAINERS file, because I was looking under Documentation/
2. PATCH 1/2 probably didn't make it to gmane
3. PATCH 1/2 is a bit problematic because of the encoding ...
So, I'll have to do something about 2 and 3, but that will be tomorrow.
Kalin.
