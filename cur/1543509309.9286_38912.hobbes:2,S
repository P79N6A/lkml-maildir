I think your taking this a little too far. Things don't just magically
appear in the kernel. The author needs to submit it in a suitable fashion
for inclusion. So the answer might be as simple as "The author never tried
to get it included", have you even asked the author about this and does
s/he even _want_ it in the kernel?
