First of all, this is really a feature addition, not a bug fix. :)
The reason we haven't included this so far is that we don't really have
any machines that need sparsemem on i386 that aren't NUMA.  So, we
disabled it for now, and probably need to decide first why we need it
before a patch like that goes in.
I actually have exactly the same patch that you sent out in my tree, but
it's just for testing.  Magnus, perhaps we can get some of my testing
patches in good enough shape to put them in -mm so that the non-NUMA
folks can do more sparsemem testing.
