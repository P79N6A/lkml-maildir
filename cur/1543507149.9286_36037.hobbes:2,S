With your patch you must be careful because the child may always be
rescheduled before the parent after a kernel_thread call, so if you
convert a piece of code this way:
	struct task_struct child_tsk = NULL;
	parent()
	{
		child_tsk = kernel_thread(child);
	}
	child()
	{
		child_tsk->something = pippo;
	}
then you may really get an Oops. With the old logic you was forced to do:
	struct task_struct child_tsk = NULL;
	parent()
	{
		kernel_thread(child);
	}
	child()
	{
		child_tsk = current;
		child_tsk->something = pippo;
	}
and the above can't fail.
Anyway both bdflush and kflushd doesn't use the global task-struct pointer
inside themself so they seems safe w.r.t. the above scenario.
