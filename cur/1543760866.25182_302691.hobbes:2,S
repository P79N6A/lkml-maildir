I ran the little test program on my 2.4.26  Knoppix system, and got the 
following two results:
  strace a.out < /dev/tty
   ...
   read(0, NULL, 6)                        = 1
   ...
  strace a.out < /dev/zero
   ...
   read(0, 0, 6)                           = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
   ...
The first case looks broken.
