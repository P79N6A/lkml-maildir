Do we really want this?
In my oppinion we run the risk here of encouraging behaviour akin to
what NVidia is doing - release a small kernel "glue" module and then
keep the driver proper in a binary blob (in userspace, but still a
binary blob).
If the company goes out of business and take their driver source with
them then users are left with a useless, un-debugable, un-maintainable
binary blob.
Don't we instead want to encourage/pressure people to release specs
and/or source code for their hardware/drivers so open, modifiable
drivers can be written?
This opens the door for people to start writing closed drivers. In the
long run that seems to me like a bad deal for our users.
