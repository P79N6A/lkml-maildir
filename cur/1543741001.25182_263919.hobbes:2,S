On realtime-preempt-2.6.9-mm1-U10.3:
o	In rcupdate.h, I believe that the:
	+# define rcu_read_unlock_nort()                rcu_read_lock_nort()
	should instead be:
	+# define rcu_read_unlock_nort()                rcu_read_unlock()
	It looks to me like the current definition would cause
	preemption to be permanently disabled in a kernel with
	CONFIG_PREEMPT but without CONFIG_PREEMPT_REALTIME,
	at least if one used SysV IPC.
o	The rcu_read_lock_spin(), rcu_read_lock_read(),
	rcu_read_lock_bh_read(), rcu_read_lock_sem(), and
	rcu_read_lock_bh_spin() APIs cannot be called recursively.
	But you probably already knew that.  ;-)
	I don't understand why the rcu_read_lock_sem() API gets its
	own #ifdef.
o	Some recent RCU patches acquire the update-side lock
	under rcu_read_lock(), which I believe will deadlock here.
	Since the same CPU/task is acquiring the same lock twice, I don't
	believe that the mutex mods help, but could easily be mistaken.
	Then again, this may well be why there are all the emails on
	this thread advising that SELinux be disabled.
