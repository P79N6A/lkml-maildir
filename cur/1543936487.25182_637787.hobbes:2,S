Yes, that could be done, and I agree that it will probably be faster
than iterative review/rework cycles between you and me. I'll free some
cycles next week for that.

Really? I didn't know that. So that's another thing that the i2c
subsystem is not doing like the rest of the kernel? Can you please
point me to the code that does this?

The driver name and the device name are different things! The "name"
attribute that i2c devices have tells user-space the device name, not
the driver name.
You may not like what the i2c subsystem does but you can't ignore its
history. The name attribute of i2c devices has been there pretty much
forever and user-space relies on it, thus we can't remove it.
