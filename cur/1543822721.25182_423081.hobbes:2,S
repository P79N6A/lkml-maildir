Done. Keep in mind it was taken only after one of those BUGs that seemed
to cause a network connection loss into the emulation. It was not taken
after one of those "stops" in 'complete preempt' mode. Did the logdev
output show anything of interest concerning the "stops"?

I assume you mean in preemptable kernel mode. Will do asap. I have 4
machines I'm attempting to use the rt20 kernel on. All 4 have the
"stop/pause" problem in complete preempt mode. This is the only one of
the 4 that I have seen the BUGs message on so I suspect you are correct
that it may be a result of hardware/configuration. I guess if raising
that irq prio or eliminating the irq threads fixes it, then.....

All except the rtom irq. It is on the same processor as the emulations
CPU thread. Even with the rt20 patch, this is still the only way to
insure deterministic delivery of signals and such from the rtom driver
to the emulations CPU thread. What I find with the rt20 patch (so far)
is that now there seems to be an acceptable(sort of) "max" latency
(-200usec) that allows me to use the machine for things other than just
the emulation.

Actually eth2 is not being used either. Only one of the scsi controllers
is being used and it only when I boot the emulation from one of the
legacy scsi drives. One scsi card has a bus of tapes the other disks.
When I boot the emulation from a virtual disk file it's not used at all.
IDE2 is my 'linux' boot drive however.
So do you think this BUG reported in 'preempt kernel' mode is related to
the "stops" I am having in 'complete preempt mode?
