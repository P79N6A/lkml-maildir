I forgot in case you aren't fam with amanda, much of it will not run 
as any user but its own user, in this case amanda.  Security etc.

No, it just hangs forever on the su command, never coming back.  
everything else I tried, which wasn't much, seemed to keep on working 
as I sent that message with that hung su process in another shell on 
another window.  I'm an idiot, normally running as root...
I've rebooted, not knowing if an echo 0 to that variable would fix it 
or not, I see after the reboot the default value is 0 now.
