it is *not* a scheduler problem. This is an application design problem.
Do not expect > 1000 runnable processes to perform well. Apache's
one-process-per-parallel-client-connection application model is especially
bad for such kind of loads. The scheduler has more important priorities to
worry about than to fix application design problems.

There were many promises along the years, and none as of now met all the
requirements the scheduler has to fulfill. 'many runnable processes' is
not on the top of the list - if we are scheduling like mad then we have
lost lots of performance already.
even with such 'improvements', the many-parallel-clients performance of
one-process-per-request HTTP server designs is an order slower than what
is possible.
having said that, improving this workload is still a useful task and we
added improvements to the scheduler to improve this case. But those
patches sacrifice other functionality just to get better
many-runnable-processes performance, which is unacceptable.

the problem is that the *real* scheduling complexity (and needed
functionality) shows when the number of runnable processes is in the
neighborhood of the number of processors. Running many processes just
masks eg. load-balancing deficiencies in schedulers, so obviously the
simplest and most localized scheduler 'wins'. So comparing schedulers
based on many-runnable-processes load is like comparing cars solely based
on the size of their fuel tanks.

you can easily make the scheduler fast in the many-processes case by
sacrificing functionality in the much more realistic, few-processes case.
None of the patch i've seen so far maintained the current scheduler's
few-processes logic. But i invite you to improve the current scheduler's
many-processes behavior, without hurting its behavior in the few-processes
case.
