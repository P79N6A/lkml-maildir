Yes, my stupidity.  There was one more fcntl() in my source than I thought :-(
By the way, if a signal is delivered while blocked on a read, IMO, the OS 
should return EINTR.  If it doesn't, oh well, I'll live with it.
I wrote this code 5 years ago and was just now wondering why I bothered to 
test on EAGAIN. Your comment about a signal causing EAGAIN to be returned 
clarifies a lot.
