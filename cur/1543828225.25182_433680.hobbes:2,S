  Hello,
  cogito-0.17.3 was just released - bugfixes release on the latest
stable line of the Cogito user-friendly Git user interface.
  Plenty of new stuff, mostly bugfixes - especially cg-admin-rewritehist
was particularily bug-ridden and Git 1.4.0 broke some backwards
compatibility, Cogito 0.17.3 should work smoothly with it again.
  So, what's new?
  * Many cg-admin-rewritehist bugfixes; note that -r semantics was
    changed to match documentation, -k steps in to mean what -r used
    to in practice
  * Some documentation fixes
  * Adjust to some Git 1.4.0 usage changes and new-style git-http-push
  * Several other random things
  Who did what:
Bertrand Jacquin:
      Push over HTTP now works with refs/heads/foo instead of foo
Dennis Stosberg:
      cg-clean fails on files beginning with a dash
Johannes Sixt:
      cg-admin-rewritehist: Seed the commit map with the parents specified with -r
      Enhance the rewritemap seeding when given symbolic commit ids
      cg-admin-rewritehist: fix reappearing files with --filter-tree
      cg-admin-rewritehist: Add the documented but missing --msg-filter option.
      cg-admin-rewritehist: Must use the parent of the start rev to seed the map.
      cg-admin-rewritehist: Support multiple parents of the start revision (-r).
      cg-admin-rewritehist: Support partial rewriting of complicated history.
