	Recently, I've acquired a Dell 1750 PowerEdge with 
LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c1030 PCI-X Fusion-MPT
Dual Ultra 320 SCSI (rev 07).
	I booted kernel 2.6.13 and got these results
with hdparm:
/dev/sda: 59.25 MB/sec
/dev/sdb:  3.18 MB/sec
	These two harddrives are identical so the speed should
be similar. I tried
more up-to-date kernels: 2.6.14-rc3-git5 and 2.6.14-rc2-mm2,
and got the same result.
	A search on google revealed this thread on Linux kernel
mailing list: "As of 2.6.13-rc1 Fusion-MPT very slow" (from
around Aug 1, 2005). Somebody had the same problem as I am
having right now. In the thread, James Bottomley provided 
a patch against -mm kernel that solved this problem. I tried that
patch but it is out-of-date. I then fetched an older kernel,
2.6.13-rc5-mm1, and applied the patch without a problem. I
then rebooted and the patch fixed the problem:
/dev/sda: 62.33 MB/sec
/dev/sdb: 67.15 MB/sec
	My question is: is there a version of this patch
that would work with 2.6.13.3 kernel? Are there any plans
on fixing this issue in the current kernel (or is this
a very unique problem)?
	I appreciate any help.
	Thank You.
	Artur Kedzierski.
