IMHO, I think we should go by the specs (8byte boundary alignment on 64bit
platforms) until and unless it can be proven that specs are wrong. This
probably will mean that we will break things for sometime (until and unless
it is fixed in tool chain and probably will also break the capability to use
an older kernel for capturing dump). But that's unavoidable if we want to be
compliant to specs.
