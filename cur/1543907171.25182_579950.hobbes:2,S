Glad I asked :-)

True.  It is not immediately obvious from the declaration that the 
overloaded field is always freed up before anybody else needs to use 
the union.

Ah I see.  I used to let alloc_pages fail then repeat the allocation 
with __GFP_MEMALLOC set, which was easy but stupidly repetitious.  Your 
technique is better, though returning the status in the page still 
looks a little funny.  This is really about saving a page flag, no?

Serves me right for not reading that bit.  So the score for that round 
is: peterz 3, phillips 0 ;-)
