Ahh. Thats actually insightfull. OK some other archs even default to the
same if PCI bus support is enabled at all. I will have to test the
effects of this approach in bochs to see how it lives with "legacy"
host chips. Maybe this whole ide_init_default_hwifs can go completely
away then... (If anything it should be fallback only.)
