Given no legacy, I would agree with this, but I think it would imply bad 
legacy both on the kernel and the libc (it's not just glibc, either) side.

Except now the paths are gratuitously different between kernel 
programming and non-kernel programming, and we create a much harder 
migration problem.  I'd rather leave the linux/* namespace to the 
user-space libc to do whatever backwards compatibility cruft they may 
consider necessary, for example, <linux/io.h> might #include <sys/io.h> 
since some user space apps bogusly included the former name.  Leaving 
that namespace available for backwards compatibility hacks avoids those 
kinds of problems.

Exactly.
