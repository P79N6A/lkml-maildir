Crap or not, there are tons of software based on pthreads and at least 
the NGPT team says that Linus
agreed to implement for necessary kernel-infrastructure for a full, fast 
pthread implementation.
Now, if you want to implement mutexes and condition variables with the attribute
PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED then you need some functionality like the futexes.
Or NGPT will add his own syscalls to handle these things, which is simply
unnecessary double functionality.

A full semaphore is nice, but not a full replacement for a waitqueue (or 
a pthread condition variable brr..).
For the semaphore you always have to assure that the ups and downs are 
balanced, what is not the case
for the condition variable.
