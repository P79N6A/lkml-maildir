Hi Jamie,
Yeah, I'd be glad to add the round-trip time to cpuinfo.  I see
this as a bogomips like metric.  It tells you how quickly you 
can move cache lines from chip to chip.
The patch currently prints the round-trip time and the max_delta.
On a Quad P4 Xeon, I got round-trip times in the 0.7 microsecond
range which is disappointing. The max_delta was almost always
zero cycles meaning that the feedback loop thinks that the TSC values
are perfectly synchronized.
