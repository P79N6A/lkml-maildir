Hello,
ide-scsi is deprecated and should not be used
any longer. Instead you should use the ide 
device directly. F.ex.
cdrecord dev=dev/hdc ...
But as far as i know, cdrdao does not support
this yet :(
When I was trying to burn with ide-scsi earlier
in 2.6.0-testX, I also had lockups. I think if
you need to use cdrdao, then you might better 
stick to 2.4.x kernels until cdrdao learns it.
regards,
claas
