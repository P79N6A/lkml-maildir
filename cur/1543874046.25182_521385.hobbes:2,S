I'm not sure whether this ever worked.

Appletouch is bound to the device:

But the X server touchpad driver doesn't work anymore, that means i
can't emulte a right click by tapping with 3 fingers on the mouse pad.
after restarting x the mouse driver works again. So i think this is
maybe a problem in X?
