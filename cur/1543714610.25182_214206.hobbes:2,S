Or do a generic fix: check for the PCI-ID of the Nforce2 and when
it is true and the timer is wrong just correct it. That's ugly,
but it's probably the best solution for such a common issue
(and the IO-APIC code is already filled with workarounds anyways)
One problem is that this likely must happen before the PCI quirks
run. In the x86-64 code I have special "early PCI scanning" code 
for this that could be copied. I don't have a Nforce2, but when
someone is willing to test I can do a patch for this.

P.S.: This problem of reference BIOS bugs getting haunting Linux
even after they are long fixed is unfortunately common :-(
