This can't be right. Those variables are never initialized anywhere.
The usage of 'cmd' should either be removed entirely, or it should be 
passed in as an argument, it looks like. In the meantime, it's better to 
have code that doesn't compile than code that compiles but can't possibly 
do anything sane.
