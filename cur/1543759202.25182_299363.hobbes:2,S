You'll have better luck using linux-audit list.

No patches needed (although you will want 2.6.11 because the inode filter
was busted, and you'll likely want to use it), for opened anyway.  You'll
need an additional auditfs patch for created/deleted/changed(for more
than just knowing open w/ write access) and it's not a stable patch yet.

You'll need auditd, auditctl, and some rules to capture what you care
about.
For example:
To watch accesses to /etc/passwd (not creation/deletion events).
# auditd
# auditctl -a entry,possible -S open
# auditctl -a exit,always -S open -F inode=(inode of /etc/passwd)
