Haven't managed to repro it yet, but DEBUG_PAGE_ALLOC turned up another 
case of doing tlb flushes with preempt on:
BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: init/1

This code seems a bit fast and loose anyway, since it only does a local 
TLB flush, which means that other CPUs can still accessed free memory if 
they still have a stale TLB for it.  Having the tlb flush happen on a 
random CPU doesn't really affect things much.
