Unfortunately these patches do not solve the problem in general but
rather fix one specific codepath. As far as I can see the warnings will
return as soon as we add another pass-through port to the link (and I am
considering adding a pass-through port to the trackpoint driver so you
will get chain like i8042-synaptics-ptport-trackpoint-ptport-psmouse).
Plus they are ugly and complicate serio and psmouse cores. I really
don't like this *_nested business as it makes the code aware of possible
usage patterns instead of just being re-entrant.
