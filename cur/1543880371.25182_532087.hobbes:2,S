More afterthoughts.  If a mutex is used to protect access against
removal.  There is no reason to hold reference to it.
kernel_thread()
{
	/* wanna dereference my_obj */
	mutex_lock();
	verify my_obj is there and use it if so.
	mutex_unlock();
}
remove()
{
	mutex_lock();
	kill_it();
	mutex_unlock();
}
I probably have over simplified it but using both mutex and reference
counts doesn't make much sense.  IOW, you get an active reference when
you grab the mutex excluding its removal and verified it's still there.
There probably are other reasons why things are done that way and we can
 and probably will have to resort to mixed solutions in foreseeable
future but I don't think there is any inherent problem in applying
immediate-disconnect in the described situation.
Feel free to scream at me if I'm getting it totally wrong.  :-)
Thanks.
