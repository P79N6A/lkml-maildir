It looks sensible to me.

Please wrap at 80-cols.
I wouldn't bother making this FASTCALL.  It's an ugly thing, and why this
particular function?  And this isn't fastpath stuff.

Ditto.

Feel free to add some kernel-doc for this function ;)

Opinions vary a bit, but I think we mostly prefer to put the
EXPORT_SYMBOL()s at the site of the thing which is being exported:
foo()
{
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo);
because it keeps all the info in the same place.  (We don't declare
functions to be static or to return char* or to be __init at a different
place in the source file..).
Then again, it's legit to follow existing local style too.  Someone will
come along later and fix it all in a single hit.  Whatever.
