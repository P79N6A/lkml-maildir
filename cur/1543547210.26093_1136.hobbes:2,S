The fact that if $$BASH is not defined, Korn shell, Bourne shell, Bourne
Again Shell, C Shell and Tenon C Shell, all hiccup on the "else if". In
addition, there's an extra 'fi' at the end. This is definitely not C shell
syntax nor is it proper Bourne shell syntax. Check 'man ksh' or 'man
bash'.

Precisely my problem. However, if you are writing Bourne shell syntax,
then you CANNOT assume that $(shell ...) could be anything. In fact, if
shell is not defined, then 'SHELL' defaults to /bin/sh. See 'info make'.
A little demonstration:
% uname -a
SunOS marathon 5.7 Generic_106541-07 sun4u sparc
% cat test
if [ -x "$BASH" ]; then
        echo $BASH
else if [ -x /bin/bash ]; then
        echo /bin/bash
else
        echo sh
fi
% /bin/sh test
test: syntax error at line 8: `end of file' unexpected
% /bin/ksh test
test: syntax error at line 3 : `else' unmatched
% /bin/csh test
Missing ]
% /usr/local/bin/tcsh test
if: Expression Syntax.
% /usr/gnu/bin/bash test
test: line 8: syntax error: unexpected end of file
Now change "else if" to "elif":
% cat test 
if [ -x "$BASH" ]; then
        echo $BASH
elif [ -x /bin/bash ]; then
        echo /bin/bash
else
        echo sh
fi
% /bin/sh test 
/usr/gnu/bin/bash
% /bin/ksh test 
/usr/gnu/bin/bash
% /bin/csh test 
Missing ]
% /usr/local/bin/tcsh test 
if: Expression Syntax.
% /usr/gnu/bin/bash test 
/usr/gnu/bin/bash
Everything works as expected.

Correct. In situations where $(CONFIG_SHELL) is used in the Makefile or
Rules.make, the syntax following is definitely bash-specific.
> So, what is the benefit of using a new keyword 'elif' here?
Because it's proper shell syntax; whereas, 'else if' is not.
