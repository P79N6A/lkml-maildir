For direct-io into higher-order pages.  When doing direct-io into a hugetlb
page we need to make sure that get_user_pages() pins the correct pageframe.
Possibly we need to turn it on regardless of CONFIG_HUGETLBPAGE for people
who want to do direct-io or PEEKTEXT/POKETEXT into mmapped soundcard
buffers, for example.  Perhaps there's a race which could permit direct-io
to write to a freed page via this route..
Davem had some reason why he might want to turn on the compound logic
permanently - related to TCP access to/from higher-order pages, I think.
