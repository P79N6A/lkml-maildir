IIRC it should have the L [probably UL instead] since numerical
constants are of type ``int'' by default.  
Normally this isn't a problem since int == long on most platforms that
run Linux.  However, by the standard 0xdeadbeef is not a valid unsigned
long constant.
Consider the following...
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
  unsigned int x;
  x = 4;
  if (x < 0xdeadbeef) printf("hello");
  return 0;
}
If you run splint on that you get

Splint 3.1.1 --- 13 Jun 2004
test2.c: (in function main)
test2.c:7:7: Operands of < have incompatible types (unsigned int, int):
                x < 0xdeadbeef
  To ignore signs in type comparisons use +ignoresigns
Finished checking --- 1 code warning

As far as I know splint follows C99 which means that it thinks the
constant is "int".
