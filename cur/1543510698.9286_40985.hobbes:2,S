Once upon a time, I had the same problem. I reused the old .config
from 2.0.x, which was the problem (hadn't heard about make oldconfig
then :). The problem was, that in 2.0.x PS/2 support could be compiled
as module, which is not possible anymore in 2.2.x. Changing 
CONFIG_PSMOUSE=m
to
CONFIG_PSMOUSE=y
in .config and recompiling the kernel solved the problem.
