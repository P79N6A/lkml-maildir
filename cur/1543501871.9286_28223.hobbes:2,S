Right. You do. It's a combination of my idiocy and idiocy of slocate
authors. Sigh... In case of root directory the second entry (fake "..")
got an d_off (offset of the next entry) equal to 0 *if* there were
additional entries successfully filled by getdents(). My idiocy.
	Now, authors of slocate, in their infinite wisdom, decided to do
seekdir after each readdir. Which means that they call getdents (on a
decently-sized buffer) for each bloody offset. It is idiocy. Number of
getdents() calls is 2 orders of magintude higher than it should be.
Combination of those bogosities gave an infinite loop.
	Fix for FAT attached (it's against -ac8, with 2.2.9 it will get a
line numbers offset but will apply fine).
	As for slocate... Look for seekdir(recdir, telldir()); and shoot
it. Dunno if the author reads l-k (he didn't leave an address in the
source), but just in case: seekdir() is *NOT* needed if you read
sequentially. Just as fseek(); is not needed for files in the similar
case.
	Down, not across...
