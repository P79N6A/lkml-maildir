My point wasn't speed, but efficient use of memory. A bitmap is certainly 
better than storing n*sizeof(swap_entry_t) byes. Extents would be better 
again, but perhaps not as big after the bitmap switch.

Yes, I didn't think Rafael was harsh in that email, but that's just my 
opinion. Regarding "without patch attached", could you please remember that 
comment next time you comment on my patches?

You know that I disagree that doing suspend in userspace is the right 
approach, and you know that current uswsusp can't do everything Suspend2 does 
without further substantial modification. Please stop painting me as the bad 
guy because I won't roll over and play dead for you. Please also stop 
encouraging people to use uswsusp when you have also warned that it might eat 
their partitions.
