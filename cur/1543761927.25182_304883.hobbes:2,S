So users don't matter anymore, now that's a terrible admission to make. 
  Linux wouldn't be where it is today without all those "mere" users.
I obviously think putting Squashfs into the kernel is the right thing to do.
The filesystem is endian safe and has been since the first release - it 
works on big endian and little endian, and every architecure I've tried 
it on it works (Intel 32/64, PowerPC 32/64. MIPS, ARM, Sparx).  The 
endian code which everyone seems to have got so worked up about is there 
to _make_ it endian safe.  I've already explained why making Squashfs 
natively support both little endian and big endian is important for 
embedded systems.
I have agreed to drop V1.0 support, and yes (as explained in another 
emauil), breaking the 4GB limit does involve on-disk format change.
