Um, why sendmail/majordomo?  Debian uses qmail, which has built-in list
handling.  It is fast(but non-free, ick).  To see some stats, go to
http://murphy.debian.org/mrtg/
(this is lists.debian.org)
We have turn-around times of not more than 20 minutes.  The machine is a
pentium 75, with 64m, and 120m of swap.
