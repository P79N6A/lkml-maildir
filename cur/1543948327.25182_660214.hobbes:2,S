I'v been working on some of my own changes to the one wire system.
I'll need some testers eventually, what slave devices does the iPaq
have?  What's the scheduler timer Hz on the iPaq?
I have the USB ds2490 device and ds18b20 temperature sensor.  I've
worked though deadlocks in the base driver, and I'm right now
scratching my head on a USB bulk read and write timeout.  I'm running
it under qemu and I expect that is introducing some issues.  I intend
to patch it up when I get through that.  Hardly any of the changes
touch ds1wm, so we shouldn't be stomping on each other's feet.
