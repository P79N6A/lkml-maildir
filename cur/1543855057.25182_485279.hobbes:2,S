There's the case (mmci_cmd_irq) where mmc_stop_data is not called
prior to mmci_request_end(), so it's not that simple.

I can't 100% guarantee that it's not the case, but the problem has
been reproduced by at least 2 people on 2 different boards and on 2
different sides of the Atlantic. So I'd suspect there's either a SW
problem or a HW revision problem, at least.
