Yes, he's right.
But you don't need a new system call to bind an fd.
"mount --bind /proc/self/fd/N mount_point" works, try it.

In terms of what happens in the kernel, they're almost exactly the
same: either way, a super block ends up shared by two mounts.  That's
what I meant.
I agree that in terms of what userspace has to do, if just binding
works that's simpler.  And it does seem to work with the above mount
command.
