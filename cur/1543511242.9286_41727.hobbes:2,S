Strange. When I configured windows 95 and linux on same IP address
(turning linux on after w95), w95 detected collision and disabed its
own networking (I call this feature). I wonder how they did it.
Two linuxes on same IP did very bad things, stealing IPs from each
other.
Perhaps it is not neccessary to wait for --force, but warning at
ifconfig time would certainly be handy.
