20 bits * 3 timestamps == 60 bits
60 bits <= 8 bytes
So you do need 8 bytes.

I thought of this, but I don't think it is safe.
write to file X   us=1
write to file Y   us=1
write to file Y   us=2
write to file Y   us=3
write to file X   us=2
Oops, "make" on some clients will think Y is newer than X.
Using the wrong unit would be OK, as long as it is a real
sub-second time unit that doesn't overflow... but then you
might as well convert it to microseconds.
