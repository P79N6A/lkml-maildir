Mmmm. 4/4 split now boots again, but behaves rather oddly. This is with
Nick's AS fix, plus the 4/4 fix Andrew sent me last night, which I presume
is the same as what Bill sent out.
Difficult to tell what's going on exactly. For one, the machine has lost 
it's hostname, for another, it seems to have mounted the root fs readonly. 
End of the bootlog looks like this:
----------------------
EXT2-fs warning (device sda2): ext2_fill_super: mounting ext3 filesystem as ext2
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.

Mounting the ext3 root as ext2 is normal (it's hard to un-ext3 it
whilst standing on it). The debug stuff & loss of hostname is not.
Won't accept incoming ssh connections. I can sorta start to log in
on the serial console, but readonly-ness screws it:

If I can grab any more useful info, let me know ...
