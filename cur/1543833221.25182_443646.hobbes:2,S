Sorry for flooding your emailbox again. :)
I think we should have "moron-proof" review system on LKML. Simplest
way to get started is to ignore the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL "missionaries"
trying to 'convert' code without giving proper thought to its
implications or without ascertaining the correctness of the
conversion.
Dimwits.
