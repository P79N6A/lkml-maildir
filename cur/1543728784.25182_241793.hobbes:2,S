Geoffrey Leach from the Fedora list provided a hint to the solution. 
There's no bug. I just have to add:
none  /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc  binfmt_misc  defaults  0 0
to my /etc/fstab, and then the /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc directory 
becomes writable, with a register and a status file in it. Sorry to have 
bothered you all.
