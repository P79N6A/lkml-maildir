That would be the reason for the old IDE driver.  PATA will still be in use, but
it won't be mainstream.

Of course it will - the same is true today.  That doesn't mean it will be in      
mainstream use.  The systems that do use PATA will benefit from having it
supported in a smaller footprint driver.  It will be analogous to using the 
current 'old' IDE driver on a 4 MB 386 today.

No, I'm not.       
20-40 GB of RAM will be very cheap in a few years time.  A lot of the devices
using disks today will be using direct memory mapped RAM as their main storage
in the near future.  You don't need *ATA for that...
