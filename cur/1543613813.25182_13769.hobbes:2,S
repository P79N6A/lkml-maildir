So you cant tap the data anywhere. 
Think
encrypted music fed to an encrypted audio controller to speakers which
decrypt and add watermarks
encrypted video decrypted and macrovision + watermarked only in buffers
the CPU cant access
audio input that has legally mandated watermark checks and wont record
watermarked data.
That is the dream these people have. They'd also like the OS to scan for
"illicit" material and phone the law if you do, and to have a mandatory
remote shutdown of your box
(and if you read the MS media player license anyone who agrees to it signed
up to that)
