What's it doing at the time?  (kgdb is great for this sort of thing: hit
^C, go for a wander through the thread callchains).
Presumably it's spinning on the bkl.  Is this actually an SMP machine?  If
so, perhaps some other process is holding the bkl for a long time.  Perhaps
a netdevice spending a long time diddling hardware in an ioctl, something
like that.

Definitely not.
That code could be converted to the kthread API btw.
