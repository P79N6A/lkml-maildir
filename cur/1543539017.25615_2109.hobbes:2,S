I know this. I've already sent you a patch to remove it again from one of
my drivers where he'd added it to be safe.

...especially if we put the suggested check into sleep_on() to catch the
cases where we fuck it up, at least temporarily.

If the next step isn't to start removing the BKL from some of those
sections of code, then what's the point? And if that _is_ the next step,
then I stand by my request that a sanity check be put in sleep_on() or
better still, that sleep_on() just be removed to prevent it from being
misused.
