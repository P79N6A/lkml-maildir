Hmm, this may be the design of the system, but from experience I can say 
that I've only had one computer that wouldn't later use a mouse or 
keyboard if it wasn't plugged in at boot.  All my systems for the last 
three years will happily boot with nothing plugged in and use a mouse 
and keyboard whenever you want to plug them in.  That one system that 
needed the mouse/keyboard plugged in at boot was Winblows.  It would 
work fine in Linux.
