I fully agree with everything in your mail so far. What annoyed me is
some people advocating their changes under the false pretense that
existing use was broken, which it isn't.
completions _do_ make cleaner code for the intended case. But your
writing above is very clear and already explains that very well.
Lets put the issue to rest and get back to more productive work!
