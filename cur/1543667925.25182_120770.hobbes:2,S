Jens,
 I  found whats using 32MB out of 8192-byte slab.
size-8192       before:10 after:4012 diff:4002 size:8192 incr:32784384
It is deadline_init():
        dd->hash = kmalloc(sizeof(struct list_head)*DL_HASH_ENTRIES,GFP_KERNEL);
It is creating 8K hash table for each queue. Since we have 4000 queues,
it used 32MB. I wonder why the current code needs 1024 hash buckets, 
when maximum requests are only 256. And also, since you are making
request allocation dynamic, can you change this too ? Any issues here ?
Thanks,
Badari
