It's good that there is a push to get non-binary-module support for 
these controllers in Linux. It's a shame that this is only happening now 
though.
It does rather suck that IBM changed to use this AIC79xx controller with 
"HostRAID" in the x346, x236, etc. servers. The last generation of 
servers (x235, x345) used an LSI Logic MPT Fusion controller which could 
do RAID 1 in hardware (or at least firmware) without a special driver - 
this sufficed for certain applications. With the new machines, RAID on 
the onboard controller requires using the stupid binary module which is 
only built against certain specific kernels, or using pure software RAID..
