I'm afraid we'll have to go the latter way, because the same limitation is
for irqsafe spinlocks, rwlocks etc. %psr register is just badly designed,
fortunately Sun fixed this in v9. cli() already does a psr read and write,
save_flags(flags); cli(); takes even three psr accesses (but spinlocks use
save_and_cli()), so I guess we can take 4 more instructions (masking can be
done instead of the nops) in restore_flags. The IDE
save_flags/cli/restore_flags is on SMP far slower than those four insns
anyway.
