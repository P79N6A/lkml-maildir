I'm sorry but I'm confused. Do you mean that I shouldn't try to
support the brightness using the default video driver (ie: leave it as
a board specific driver because the board's ACPI implementation for
video support is insufficient) or did you mean that it will be easy
and simple to fit in video.c?

I'm confused by hotkey here. I'm not sure how hotkey is involved here.
The Atlas board has no  keys physically. It has buttons which are
hooked up using the ASIM HID and that is what I am trying to support
since those physically exist on the board. Can you help me understand
how hotkey is involved in this?
Thanks,
