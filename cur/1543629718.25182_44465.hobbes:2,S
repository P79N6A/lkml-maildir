Hi Andre,
can you tell me please when your patch to support the 160 GB Matrox 
HDs got into the 2.4 tree (which version)? It was 2.4.14, right?
I searched the changelog but could not find it.
Also, could you please send me a copy of the patch?
Google didn't find it...
I have a machine running 2.4.10-pre2-xfs with XFS support.
Would the patch apply cleanly or will I have to update the kernel 
in order to support the drive?
Thanks,
 Robert
