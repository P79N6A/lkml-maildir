Sure, you want the assertions in more than one file, and I definately
agree that you want as many as possible, what I meant was if you're
having (for example) a problem with file system corruption, the bug
probably isn't going to be in the ethernet driver or the video4linux
drivers. And if you're debugging a device driver your're writing, you'll
probably know the exact file the problems are in. Sure, there will be
times when the bug could be anywhere, but usually you have at least
*some* idea where the bug is. Then, if you can't find it at first, maybe
*later* you can go in and put it/turn on the assertions for the entire
kernel.
