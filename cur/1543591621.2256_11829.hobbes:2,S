I think you're kind of missing the point.  Erik is saying that, by the
path, it appears to be a file, even though it isn't listed as a file in
the directory /dev/sda.  Network sockets don't have a path, unless its a
Unix domain socket, and then you /can/ 'ls' it.
My opinion is that putting options directly in the open is no nicer than
an ioctl.  I think that where this scheme really shines, though, is
where there are multiple logical channels to a device, as in the
/dev/fb0/control example.  I like that.  What could be done, therefore,
is have a /dev/ttyS0/control file, where you could "echo
'baud=19200,parity=odd' > /dev/ttyS0/control" or even "echo '19200' >
/dev/ttyS0/baud" and "echo 'odd' > /dev/ttyS0/parity".  That seems to me
to be the cleanest and most logical solution.
As for this partition stuff, it seems a bad example to me.  Maybe I'm
just spoiled, but I think partitions is something that the kernel can
and should abstract.  None of this /dev/sda/offset=12345,limit=45678
madness.
