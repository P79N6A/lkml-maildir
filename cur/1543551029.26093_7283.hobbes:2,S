i think the OOM algorithm should not kill processes that have
child-processes, it should first kill child-less 'leaves'. Killing a
process that has child processes likely results in unexpected behavior of
those child-processes. (and equals to effective killing of those
child-processes as well.)
But this mechanizm can be abused (a malicious memory hog can create a
child-process just to avoid the OOM-killer) - but there are ways to avoid
this, eg. to add all the 'MM badness' points to children? Ie. a child
which has MM-abuser parent(s) will definitely be killed first.
