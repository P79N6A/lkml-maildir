Well, the same issue arised recently somewhere else too on this list and
lots of C programmers (not only beginners) don't know about the 3 char
types as speficied in the C standard.
[ The C standard may have got problems recently with the real world
usinf UTF-8 for a printable character but this must be solved
elsewhere. ]

ACK.

Syntactically yes. Conceptually no IMHO. sizeof(char) must be ==
sizeof(unsigned char) and must have the same alignment. So a cast seems
to be the simpler and cleaner solution.

AFAIK applies -Wsign-compare in gcc-3 only to pure compares (<, >, ...)
and not assignments/passed parameters too.

As above - this will probably be silently promoted by gcc-3.
