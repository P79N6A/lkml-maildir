Go, Miquel!

If two CPUs hit i_size_write() at the same time we have a bug.  That
function requires that the caller provide external serialisation, via i_sem.
Try adding this to the start of i_size_write():
	if (down_trylock(&inode->i_sem) == 0) {
		printk("I am buggy\n");
		dump_stack();
		up(&inode->i_sem);
	}
