Subject: [PATCH 0/7] CCISS cleanups

This is a series of minor cleanups to the cciss (HP Smart Array) driver:
  1  disable device before returning failure
  2  claim all resources the device decodes, not just I/O ports
  3  print more useful identification when driver claims device
  4  remove intermediate #define for ARRAY_SIZE
  5  fix spelling errors
  6  unparenthesize "return" statements
  7  Lindent (warning, huge diff, but changes whitespace only)
They're in order of usefulness.
