The false negative I mentioned was the last unresolved issue I knew of.
A brief examination of your updated patch didn't help me to spot any
false positives that haven't been reported yet.
It may help to find the line numbers corresponding to the above
(actually, the way the macros are hooked, the files, functions, line
numbers could be reported directly by the implementation) so we can get
a better idea if this is a false positive or a real 997us long non-
preemptible critical section.
