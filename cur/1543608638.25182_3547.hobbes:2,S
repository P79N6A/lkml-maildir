 When I try to add a new IDE disk to the channel 1 with the command
"hdparm -R 0x170 0 0 /dev/hda", I've got a kernel oops (and freeze)..
It's works fine _once_, if there wasn't any detected disk on channel
before.
my config:
 kernel 2.4.9 - 2.4.14pre7 (I've tried many of them)
 PIIX and VIA motherboards (shows same error)
