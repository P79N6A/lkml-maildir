That addresses only (b).  But (a) would still need a solution.
It's common that any given pin be usable for multiple different
purposes ... it's rarely hardwired only to a GPIO controller.
More usually it will be multiplexed to several other controllers
under software control.  (Some chips allow up to eight choices,
Others only have two or three.)

As you probably know, there is no such thing as IORESOURCE_GPIO;
that could be changed if necessary.

If there's going to be a "user-gpio" driver it could just as easily
take an array of GPIOs in its platform data; and that would usuallly
take a lot less space, even if it's not compressed to a bitmask!

Actually GPIOs don't need to start at zero, and the numbering doesn't
need to be continuous.  On one system I use, GPIOs start at 32; on
another, they go 0..63 and then 192..207; and that's just for the
once on the same chip as the CPU!
As far as configuration goes, what would be useful would be to have
someone do a survey of the existing userspace tools that work with
GPIOs, and see what they're trying to do.  I'd start with that one
for Gumstix, since it's got a fairly broad problem domain.

Yes, using gpio_request() is the natural solution.  I hope to see more
platforms actually implementing it before too long.
