wait_queue_head_t wait_thing;
Interruptible_sleep_on_timeount(&wait_thing, timeout), now requires
that "wait_thing" must have been initialized with:
init_waitqueue_head(&wait_thing);
If you didn't do this before this object was used, all bets are
off.
Also, you cannot sleep during an interrupt or when you are holding
a spin-lock that disables interrupts.

This is correct. The flags are pushed then popped into the
variable provided.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
