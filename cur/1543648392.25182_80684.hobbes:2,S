Ahh, yes.  Exactly so.  My apologies for missing your point.
Still, I don't think this is a big deal.  The problem is that if
a chroot-ed process can call chroot() again, it can escape from the
chroot jail.  There is one obvious solution: simply don't allow chroot-ed
process to call chroot() again.  This is addressed in the link I posted
previously.
So I still think that chroot() could plausibly be made safe for non-root
users.
