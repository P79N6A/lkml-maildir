Looks nice.   And yes, you hung onto the atomic kmap across multiple
iov segments ;)  That will save a tlb invalidate per segment.

We're not allowed to schedule away inside atomic_kmap - must remain
in the same task, on the same CPU etc.  So the pagefault handler
will return immediately if we take a pagefault while copying to/from
userspace while holding an atomic kmap.
So the code first touches the userspace page (via __get_user) to
fault it in.  Now, there is a 99.999999% chance that the copy_*_user()
will not fault - it will remain wholly atomic.
But there is the 0.0000001% chance that the VM will evict (or at least
unmap) the page between the __get_user() and the completion of the 
copy_*_user().  In this case, copy_*_user() will fail and will return
a short copy.
Now, we could just touch the page with another __get_user() and retry
the atomic kmap approach.  But I flipped a coin and decided to fall back
to a regular sleeping kmap instead.  With a sleeping kmap, in a
non-atomic region the kernel will actually take the fault, fix it up
and the copy_*_user() will work OK.
