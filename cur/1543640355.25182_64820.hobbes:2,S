It appears i'm completely unable to not use devfs.  Attempting to run
the kernel without mounting devfs results in it still being mounted or
if not compiled in, locks up during boot.  Attempts to run the kernel
and mv /dev does not work, umounting /dev does not work and rm'ing /dev
does not work.  I cant create the non-devfs  nodes while devfs is
mounted and i cant boot the kernel without devfs.  It seems that no
uninstall procedure has been made and i've read the documentation that
comes with the kernel about devfs and it says nothing about how to move
back to the old device nodes from devfs.  
anyone have any suggestions?
