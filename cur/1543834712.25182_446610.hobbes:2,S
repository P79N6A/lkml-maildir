The sad facts I learned from Debian bug #212762 (not kernel related) that
culminated in CVE-2005-2335 (remote root exploit against older
fetchmail) and from various qmail bugs Guninski discovered:
- a bug need not necessarily be found soon after introduction
- a bug report may not convey the hint "look at this NOW, the shit
  already hit the fan"
  (sorry, I meant to write: look NOW, it's urgent and important)
- an automated test to catch non-trivial mistakes is non-trivial in
  itself, and - what I've seen with another project I was involved with,
  and more often than I found amusing - is that the test itself can be
  buggy causing bogus results.
That doesn't mean I object to automated tests, but "it should have been
found by now" (because the source is open, someone could have tested it,
whatever) just doesn't work.
