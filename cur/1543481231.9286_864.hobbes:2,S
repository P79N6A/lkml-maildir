Which distro and libc?  RedHat 5.0 shipped with a broken glibc which
couldn't completely disable NIS and NIS+ so when it came across a uid
in the filesystem that it didn't know about (like torvalds=1046 :) it
broadcast around the network for a nis server to identify the miscreant.
And then it waited for 2-3 secs and gave up and stored only the numberic
ID in the tar file.  And then it went onto the next file...
I suspect that this is your problem.
Matthew.
