I did a slight modification of the patch I committed initially, in the 
face of the report from Marcel that the initial sledge-hammer approach 
broke his hald setup.
See commit 9ee8ab9fbf21e6b87ad227cd46c0a4be41ab749b: "Relax /proc fix a 
bit", which should still fix the bug (can somebody verify? I'm 100% sure, 
but still..), but is pretty much guaranteed to not have any secondary side 
effects.
It still leaves the whole issue of whether /proc should honor chmod AT ALL 
open, and I'd love to close that one, but from a "minimal fix" standpoint, 
I think it's a reasonable (and simple) patch.
Marcel, can you check current git?
