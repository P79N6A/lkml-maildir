Just amused myself checking all data I can find about such stuff.
And read the replies by Hirofumi and hpa.
I completely agree with them.
The DOS situation is not so much that 0 is an end-of-dir marker.
It marks that this entry, and all following entries, has never
been used.
For the time being there is no justification for "oldfat".
The only place where this behaviour has been reported (not only by you,
I saw several references) is on Psion PDAs. So "psion" would be a more
obvious name, if a mount option is needed.
And maybe no mount option is needed.
Your 2nd and 3rd points can be done always, I think, unless our FAT code
should mimic the DOS FAT behaviour (on non-DOS filesystems).
