I don't think it would be a really good idea to have an official tree
for desktop users. A staging area for desktop improvements, sure that
would be no problem. But if you really have some good improvements,
they should eventually get into the mainline kernel where you can
expect a pretty good (or not terribly bad) review and testing process.
On the other hand, I understand you're probably frustrated at the slow
pace and politics of getting more ambitious patches into the kernel.
I'd go for angle of aiming to get things into -mm. Andrew generally
doesn't mind brewing things up there, even if there is no clear path
for merging into 2.6 at the time... so long as they're pretty stable
and not going to cause rejects all over the tree, of course.
Just my two cents.
