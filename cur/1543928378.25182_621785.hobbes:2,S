Maybe you are right, maybe I've used wrong words... But, e.g., google
pretends to know about this first right too. And I've meant generally,
not about open software.

I don't demand anything. I've only expressed my personal opinion
that usually (if possible) the choice is better than no choice.
And, since I don't know anything in open source forbiding this, I
can ask, why you demand to take away offered choices; actually, I
think it would be much easier if you could fork the other way...

It's only a part of the theory: usually it's easier to find some bugs
if there is a possibility to compare a performance with other options;
there is also kind of stimulation and flow of new ideas between them.
Otherwise it's not so hard to overlook some stagnation.
