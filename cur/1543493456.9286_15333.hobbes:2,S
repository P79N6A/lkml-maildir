That requires another (reliable!) user-level process running at all times
for the feedback to make it to the admin, or for the admin to take
manual action (looking at some counters after reading a HOWTO).
In contrast, counters and a printk always informs the admin, at the
cost of a couple of lines of code in the kernel.
BTW, there is a counter of dropped packets now, netdev_rx_dropped.
I'm not sure where it comes out... the RX-DRP field of netstat -i?
someplace in proc?
Is there philosophy in the curent kernel about printks of this type?
