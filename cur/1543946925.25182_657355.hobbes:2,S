Whatever we think about systems using port 0x80, fact of the matter is that 
they do and outside of legacy stuff that isn't applicable to these systems, 
Linux needs to stop using it (post ACPI init at least) to be able to run on 
them.
As options of doing so we have:
1) Replace the port 0x80 I/O delay with nothing. Determined to be unsafe.
2) Replace 0x80 with another port. None are really available and DMI based 
switching gets to be unmaintainable and has a such been shot down.
3) Replace the port 0x80 I/O delay with a udelay(2). Should work well enough 
in practice for the remaining users outside legacy drivers after (Alan's) 
cleaning up.
The remaining (possible) problem is that pre calibration microseconds are a 
total fiction and at least PIT init happens before calibration. In practice 
I believe this might not be much of a real-world problem since for whatever 
initial value for loops_per_jiffy we get at least our old double short jump 
that is enough of a delay for 386 and 486 but I sympathise with anone, such 
as HPA, who'd consider my beliefs not a particular guarantee.
So, we need a more useful pre calibration udelay. Ugly as it might be, 
through something like the attached. Alan, could you perhaps comment?
With the problam surfacing only post ACPI init, the _last_ remaining option 
is talking to the PIT using port 0x80 at init and using udelay after but I 
myself will not be submitting a patch to do so. Insane mess.
It would be good to get this crap sorted relatively quickly so we can do 
away with the io_delay mongering even pre .26 again. It introduces boot 
parameters and as such becomes part of API somewhat, so if it's not going to 
stay let's kill it quickly.

    x86: per CPU family loops_per_jiffy initialization
    Following the current port 0x80 I/O delay replacements we need
    microseconds to be somewhat usefully defined pre calibration.
    Initialize 386, 486 and Pentium 1 as fastest in their families
    and higher CPUs (including 64-bit) at 1 Ghz. Note that trouble
    should be absent past family 5 systems anyway.
