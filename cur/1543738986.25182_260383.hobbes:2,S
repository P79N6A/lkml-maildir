Subject: [PATCH 2.6] fore200e.c replace pci_find_device with pci_get_device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

As pci_find_device is going away soon I have converted this file to use
pci_get_device instead. I have compile tested it. If anyone has this ATM card
and could test it that would be great.
