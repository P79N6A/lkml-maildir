Right but for the winchip its 10-30% difference in performance the
others are the odd %age point (except 386)

Thats hard because we run a lot of the kernel before that point. So 
you'd want to write the asm checks for it in boot.S really, or export
CPU flag lists and model data and make the boot loader able to do so,
that also means grub can be taught to boot the best kernel of a set and
handle stuff itself
