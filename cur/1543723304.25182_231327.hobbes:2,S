One thing to note is that NPTL defaults to PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED
while LinuxThreads defaults to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED.
So, if you care about what scheduling created threads will have
and want it to work with both NPTL and LinuxThreads, you want
pthread_attr_setinheritsched (&attr, PTHREAD_*_SCHED);
explicitely.
