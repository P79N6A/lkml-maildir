    But the set of sanitized kernel headers, if you build your own
software and you're not using a distro, is only available for 2.6.x
kernels, not for 2.4.x kernels. What should be done for 2.4 kernels?
I currently use a set of headers from the 2.4 kernel I used to build
my libc, not the headers from the current kernel I'm running, but I
would like to know anyway.
