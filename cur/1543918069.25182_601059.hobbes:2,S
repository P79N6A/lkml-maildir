Sorry, I was on holidays. I assume this is in -rc9 or so, already?
Yes, seems so.
Unfortunately, cpu hotplug seems to be still behaving strangely in
-rc9. I can echo 0 > online (and cpu will go down). I do echo 0 >
online, again, and I get -EBUSY. Good. But I try to do echo 1 >
online, and get -EBUSY, too... and that's bad :-(.
root@amd:/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1# echo 0 > online
