Discovered the problem. Apparently, the machine was shipped with SCSI
set to allow DOS to access disk drives > 1GB in area. This had to be
disabled in the SCSI configuration subsection during booting.
It would seem as if this is a potentially big problem. I didn't find it
in the docs. I hope to have more information on it so that I could write
something up, maybe...
