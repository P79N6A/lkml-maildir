I can test on various 2.6 kernel ATAPI CD and DVD burners, and on 2.4 
kernel even a real SCSI CD burner as long as it lasts. I would love to 
see some mutual cooperation, but I doubt it's going to happen.
Just to be clear, Joerg is not the only one I think has been a problem 
here, he pissed off some of the developers who don't seem overly eager 
to do things which would be helpful for any burner software. From here 
it looks like a pissing content, with users well within splash range.

Do you plan on changing the interface, then? Removing the SCSI stuff 
completely? Do bear in mind that there are still SCSI burners and people 
using them, and cdrecord is currently portable to many operating systems.

Look a year down the road, when we have have two (or more) new 25GB 
optical formats coming out, probably with new features and commands and 
several vendors building drives for them. Both formats have DRM stuff in 
them, and GPL 3 forbids implementing DRM (simplification).
Better you than me, but it will be exciting. To the extent that I have 
the hardware I'll be glad to test.
