I find it extremely unlikely that the hurd would have the include file
<linux/rtnetlink.h>, which is part of the code chunk in question.  As
I said, the code is extremely linux-specific.

As I said, the current code is OS specific.  I find is EXTREMELY
unlikely it would work on anything that isn't Linux.  I wont argue
about autoconf implementation.
However, I will acknowledge that my original patch was broken.  Here
is a better one.  This should work on both pre- and post- glibc-2.3
linux systems.
