Here's an update - sorry for the delay but I need that machine for everyday work.
I have now gone back to enable TSO since vsftp with sendfile really seems
to be the only app that causes this. I have simply set it to
use_sendfile=NO and no corruption occurs at all; the machine is stable and
fast.
FWIW the corruption can still be reproduced with 2.6.24-rc5. For kicks I
have also tried -rc5 with SLAB instead of SLUB, but that didn't help
either.
The directory with the tcpdump & test data now also contains a few more
corrupted files; maybe comparing the corruption offsets gives someone a
better idea.
