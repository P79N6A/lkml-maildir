I have though about this awhile ago while kernel-hacking MkLinux on my
PowerMac 7100, which brings up another question...
What sort of technical requirements would there be to get a port of
Linux-2.2 to OSFMach included in the official source tree as another arch?  
(MkLinux-2.0.3x could be used as a starting point/guide)
