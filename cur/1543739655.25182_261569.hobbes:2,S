Yep. The code I have ported to the Linux kernel right now does not 
support multiple consoles because porting that code would be a lot more 
work (I would prefer to keep it in userland if possible since it already 
works there).
Anyway the way the system works for multiple controllers is that there is 
a separate BIOS image and separate machine state maintained for each 
graphics card. So you can run the VBE driver on the primary, secondary 
and ternary drivers if you want. We do it all the time with SNAP just for 
fun and giggles ;-)
