Yes, "if". With straight C, it's immediatly obvious the kmalloc() is the
only function with side-effects and special requirements - an
experienced hacker won't even look it up. With C++ those may be hidden
behind each object or object member, that's the philosophy of the
language. 
The problem is that in kernel mode you must know precisely when and how
you allocate memory.
