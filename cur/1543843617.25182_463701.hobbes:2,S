No, you have absolutely no reason to expect that an oops fix is languishing
in -mm when we're at -rc6.  I reviewed the patch, agreed with it, queued it
in the wrong place in the series file and promptly forgot about it.  That's
literally three seconds inattention here costing three days over there.  I hate
me.
At least I got to do it to someone else for once.  But three days!!
