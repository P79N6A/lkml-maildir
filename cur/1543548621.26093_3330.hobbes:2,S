Notice the different subject lines?  I somehow thought that I had
been subscribed to the reiserfs mailing list...

It sure looks like the second email was delivered to the reiserfs mailing
list and then resent out to the kernel mailing list.  Either it is an

which is a real domain, despite the name.
Cheers, Andreas
