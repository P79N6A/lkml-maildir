No MOVABLE memory for 64 bit platforms that do not have HIGHMEM right now?

Hmm... But his patch also introduces additional complexity plus its 
difficult to handle for the end user.

I would have expected a percentage of a node. If equal amounts of 
unmovable memory are assigned to all nodes at first then there will be 
large disparities in the amount of movable memories f.e. between a node 
with 8G memory compared to a node with 1GB memory.
How do you handle headless nodes? I.e. memory nodes with no processors? 
Those may be particularly large compared to the rest but these are mainly 
used for movable pages since unmovable things like device drivers buffers
have to be kept near the processors that take the interrupt.
