Ahh, great.  I'll change the ordering.  Should help clean up the code a bit
and make adding the features I want easier. :)
Another question:
Inact_dirty:     21516 kB
Inact_laundry:   65612 kB
Inact_clean:     19812 kB
These three are seperate lists in rmap, and are equal to "Inactive:" in the
-aa vm.
Inact_target:   150080 kB
This doesn't account any memory, but is only what the VM is trying to size
the sum of the three lists above.
Do I have that right?
I'm going to graph active and inactive for lrrd, and I need to know how to
map the different values when it is run on a rmap kernel.
Thanks.
