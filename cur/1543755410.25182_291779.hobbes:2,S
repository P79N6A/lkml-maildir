That's curious.  Last time I checked, the changes needed to use the
Intel-compiler have not been backported to 2.4.  What kernel sources
are you working off of?
Also, even with 2.6 you need a script from Intel which does some
"magic" GCC->ICC option translations to build the kernel with the
Intel compiler.  AFAIK, this script has not been released by Intel
(hint, hint...).

I suspect your kernel was just miscompiled.  We have used the
Intel-compiler internally on a 2.6 kernel and it worked fine at the
time, though I haven't tried recently.
