Subject: no counters in /proc/net/dev with the ns83820 driver?

this strike me as a bit odd.
with the driver version 1.34 (kernel is 2.4.9ac7) no statistics are
collected in /proc/net/dev, output follows
[joelja@route-views-test net]$ cat dev
Inter-|   Receive                                                |

  eth0: No statistics available
driver is built as a module:
ns83820.c: National Semiconductor DP83820 10/100/100 driver.
eth%d: disabling 64 bit PCI.
eth0: ns83820.c v0.10: DP83820 00:50:ba:37:d9:a6 pciaddr=0xf9020000 irq=12
rev 0x102
eth0: link now 10 mbps, half duplex and up.
the card in question is the dlink dfe-500t
it is connected directly to a 10Mb/s interface on an older cisco 7200
router for what it's worth. it interface is recieving about 650 packets
per second accarding to tcpdump.
the system is built around a via apollo pro266 vt8633 chipset mainboard
(supermicro p3tdde) with dual 1ghz cpus and an smp kernel.
