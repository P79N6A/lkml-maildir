4. Everything stays the same, except chroot() changes
current->namespace to current->fs->root_mnt->namespace.  This would
address your concern with chroot.

My preference is 1) or 4).
2) and 3) would have some pretty strange properties (in some
situations you can enter a directory, but you cannot get out with 'cd
..' any more)

So you are proposing selective replacement of 
  mntget(mnt);
with
  mntget(mnt);
  get_namespace(mnt->mnt_namespace);
and similar for mntput()?
What do you do on unmount?  If you set mnt->mnt_namespace to NULL,
you'd have to do a put_namespace() for each file descriptor/root/cwd
referencing the mount, but how do you do that?

It would need quite a revamp of the current reference counting.  If
I'm not mistaken, currently each vfsmount has an initial reference
given to it in alloc_vfsmnt.  And on attach, the parent namespace's
count is also increased, and vice-versa for unmount.
I'm not sure what purpose referencing the parent serves, but it won't
work with 2).  There you'd need referencing the other way round:
parents holding a reference on their children, and have no initial
reference.
With 2) it's also questionable, how you copy the namespace in clone().
Do you just copy the tree under current->fs->root_mnt?  Or do you copy
tree under cwd as well (if it's disjunct from the root tree)?
