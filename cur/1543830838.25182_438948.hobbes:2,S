Opposite here with my upstart American English references. :)

This version was actually used several times in the KConfig as well.  (See below)

^Both are reverted.  I can honestly say I'm in no way attempting to Americanise/Americanize the files or the kernel...I've intentionally passed by all the spellings I found to be valid in either Engish (Colour/Color, -ise vs -ize for example).  My reference dictionaries, which I will be changing now, were apparently more biased than I thought (they did support *some* british english).  English is complicated enough on either side of the pond, and when you combine the two you've got a whole new source of chaos and confusion.  I'm just trying to correct real mistakes, and I appologize if I err along the way.
The updated patch is below.
