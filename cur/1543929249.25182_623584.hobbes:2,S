Agreed, lets ignore that :)

He can state it when he feels like it, I don't see the point.
Authors generally get to decide whether they use EXPORT_SYMBOL
or EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL unless in cases where its really clear-cut
that EXPORT_SYMBOL is inapproriate. But thats a different matter.
If a symbol was OK to be used previously and something using it
would not automatically be considered a derived work, how does
passing &init_net to the function just to make the compiler
happy, avoid BUG_ONs and generally keep things working as before
make it more of a derived work?
