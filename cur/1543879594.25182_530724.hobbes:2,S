I think adding these lines to .git/config would do the trick,
after you have done the "checkout -b v2.6.20 v2.6.20" step:
[branch "v2.6.20"]
	remote = stable
	merge = refs/heads/master
[remote "stable"]
	url = git://git.kernel.org/.../stable/linux-2.6.20.y.git
	fetch = refs/heads/master
provided if stable team forks v2.6.20.y history off of Linus's
v2.6.20.
With the above configuration, anytime you say "git pull" while
on your v2.6.20 branch will fetch from "stable" and merge their
'master' branch in your current branch (i.e. v2.6.20 branch).
