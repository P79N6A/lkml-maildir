Most real-world filesystem I/O doesn't open(2) directories.
Most filesystem I/O is stat, open and unlink of files with
full paths, no open(2) of the directory.  Notice that i
refer to the system call not internal functions that path
lookup invoke.  The list of things that open(2) directories
is very short and almost all of them stat the the majority
of the directory's contents.

I'm sure there will be others that can show you the numbers.
Things have changed since those studies.  Disks are still
slooooooooow.  However the OS doesn't have to nursemaid the
transfer.  In most cases we queue requests and receive an
interrupt when the data is in memory.  _IF_ the disk 
isn't otherwise kept busy readahead reduces latency.
Most of the associated blocks have near proximity so there
is a good chance to do the readahead in a minumum number of
requests if they are fed to the queues in a batch.

I repeat this because i think it is a central point.  Much
of the I/O associated with directory scanning is in tight
loops that would mirror the kernel's behavior.  I have
doubts that it would produce a performance boost because it
might just be a synchronized duplication of effort.
I am not advocating doing this.  I was just exploring the
idea and bringing the thread back to the original question.
