So does it make sense to re-unify these two patch-sets
into one common, more general patch-set first?  Might
it make sense to do so in small, incremental steps that
everyone can agree on as we go along?
For example, maybe the very first thing to do is define
some notion of general "operating point" that is a super-set
of the cpufreq definition.   If we can define that structure
maybe we can progress towards introducing and using it.
Totally side-step the kernel-user level stuff for a bit...
Totally side-step the suspend/resume issues for a bit...
Thanks,
