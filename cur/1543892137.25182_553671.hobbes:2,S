Maybe storing in each task a small list of the 2 or 4 last CPUs used would
help the scheduler in trying to place them. I mean, let's say you have 10
tasks and 8 CPUs. You first assign tasks 1..8 CPUs 1..8 for 1 timeslice.
Then you will give 9..10 a run on CPUs 1..2, and CPUs 3..8 will be usable
for other tasks. It wil be optimal to run tasks 3..8 on them. Then you will
stop some of those because they are "in advance", and run 9..10 and 1..2
again. You'll have to switch 1..2 to another group of CPUs to maintain hot
cache on CPUs 1..2 for tasks 9..10. But another possibility would be to
consider that 9..10 and 1..2 have performed the same amount of work, so
let's 9..10 take some advance and benefit from the hot cache, then try to
place 1..2 there again. But it will mean that 3..8 will now have run 2
timeslices more than others. At this moment, it should be wise to make
them sleep and keep their CPU history for future use.
Maybe on end-user systems, the CPUs history is not that important because
of the often small caches, but on high-end systems with large L2/L3 caches,
I think that we can often keep several tasks in the cache, justifying the
ability to select one of the last CPUs used.
Not an easy thing to do, but probably very complementary to your work IMHO.

Willy
