printf() is not a system call. It is some procedure within the
'C' runtime library. Eventually, that library makes a call to
write() which is a kernel system call. You can use strace to see
the execution of all the system calls.
If you want to single-step through the 'C' runtime library, you
need to get their sources and compile them with the '-g' parameter
(for debugging). I don't know why you would want to do that, because
you would then have the sources so you can actually read the source
of what happens with a particular call.
