  I assume, you are talking about connected TCP sockets.
  I have never heard about any implementation, but it can be a very
interesting thing to implement. In addition to obvious problems
(serialization of state, reasonable protocol for transmitting it between
machines) there is a problem related to the nature of TCP/IP -- it's easy
to send a packet with address other than your own, but to receive one, you
have to be able to receive _all_ packets in your subnet even if they are
physically there in the first place (you aren't necessarily on
non-switched Ethernet, in the same subnet with another box, and even if
you are, you will have to set promiscuous mode and deal with all kinds of
garbage, subnet is filled with). Some kind of proxying probably will work
with remote syscalls like in MOSIX, or with some kind of proxy that can be
enabled for particular IP addresses/ports set, however this is probably
not what you are looking for -- performance of this thing will unlikely be
high enough (I assume, migration of sockets is supposed to be used to
solve performance problems, not to create additional ones).
  When I was thinking about TCP connections migration for HTTP I came to
the conclusion that migration of half-connection (sending packets from
migrated connection to remote end) with proxying another one (receiving
packets from it) through IP in IP encapsulation or another network
interface from "old" to "new" host will be sufficient for HTTP because of
its asymmetric nature (most of data is passed from servers to clients),
however it maybe much less beneficial for other protocols.
