Ouch?
You are currently adding more methods and semantics just to make
system devices separate from "normal" ones. If you keep two-stage
(actually three-stage suspend), you'll have system devices similar to
normal ones, and will have less special cases to care about.
And keyboard controller with its devices needs to be suspended
early/resumed late because both operations are likely to need
interrupts.
