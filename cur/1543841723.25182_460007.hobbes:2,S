That's BTW "possible circular locking dependency" and there is only
one CPU (no HT, single core - an old mobile Celeron P3).
I have to admit this machine has a history of mysterious hangs (black
screen of death), though I think they are related to LAN and maybe disk
activity, not GRE/PPP/ATM/ADSL (RAM tests ok, the hardware is rather
common - i440BX etc. but who knows).
