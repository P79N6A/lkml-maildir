Do you consider a single 5-byte NOP for a judiciously chosen 50 places 
in the kernel unacceptable? Note that the argument has shifted from 
static tracers to dynamic tracers: this _is_ about SystemTap: it adds 
points to the kernel where we can _guarantee_ that a dynamic probe can 
be inserted. In general there is no guarantee from gcc that any probe 
can be inserted into a function (djprobes and int3 optimization 
nonwithstanding) and this is a real practical problem for SystemTap. 
Frank can attest to that.
