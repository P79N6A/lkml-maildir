I always wondered why there is no "iocharset" option for unixoid
filesystems. IMO there could be an easy migration path for existing
installations to UTF-8:
 - convert all filenames to UTF-8 (or any other Unicode encoding)
 - mount the FS with "iocharset=UTF-8,charset=latin1" (for current
   Latin1 users). Users can continue to use their latin1 names while
   they are stored in Unicode on the disk (this is what currently
   happens with VFAT, a very nice solution IMHO)
 - when enough applications are ready for multibyte encodings, remove
   the charset/iocharset workaround and make people use .UTF-8 locales
Though, the ultimate solution for the steps 2. and 3. would be the
Microsoft-like way:
 - convert the filenames in libc (from $locale to UTF-8), depending on
   which locale the user has set
This sounds like cheating but would allow to be most flexible and most
compatible to encoding-ignoring applications.
Eduard.
