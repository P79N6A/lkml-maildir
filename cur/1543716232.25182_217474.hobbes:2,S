Hello,
    I'm working on a project (ELSA -Enhanced Linux System Accounting) that is
very similar to PAGG and CSA. My goal is to improve accounting on Linux by using
containers to group processes according to the system administrator policy.
Currently I provide a patch to 2.6.5 kernel ( 
http://elsa.sourceforge.net
 ) that
provides infrastructures to manipulate containers. The advantage of my patch is
that manipulating containers is very simple. I think that it could be very
interesting to share our work to see what could be done. Thus I will take a look
to PAGG implementation and also to the CKRM solution proposed by Chris Wright. 
Best,
Guillaume
