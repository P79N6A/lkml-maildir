I don't think so -- this code is present even in the 2.6.18-xen.hg tree
(where it's gated with is_initial_domain() which isn't suitable for the
upstream tree).
I don't really know why it should start happening now. It may be that
some of the recentish changes to e.g. early_ioremap or early pagetable
setup etc. have tweaked the layout of the early pagetables around so
this problem bites us more readily. Or it may just be a combination of
kernel image size, RAM size and perhaps a dose of bad luck.
Ian.
