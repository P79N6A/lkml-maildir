This is not the Solaris model....
I did define this model 19 years ago when I did write the first 
Generic SCSI driver at all. Adaptec indepentently did develop ASPI
2 years later and did chose the same address model. Nearly all
OS use this kind (or a very similar model) internaly inside the kernel
or the basic SCSI address routines.
