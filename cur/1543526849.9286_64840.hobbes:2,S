Hi,
The first question that everyone is going to have is, why don't you do
this in userspace? That way you can talk to whatever type of serial port
that you have in the machine (serial, multiport serial card, usb to
serial device, etc.) without tying your driver to a specific type of
hardware.
That being said, you could have your driver implement the tty interface,
thereby looking like a serial port to any user applications.
