Hi!

...platform is right thing to do, but it is also "more aggresive" than
"shutdown" -- it needs bigger chunk of ACPI BIOS to work properly.
So, it would be nice to test 2.6.20-rc2 on your favourite system (if
it breaks, try if echo "shutdown" > /sys/power/disk fixes it), and
report results. Thanks,
