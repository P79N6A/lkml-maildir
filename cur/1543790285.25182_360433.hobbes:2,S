Subject: PCI error on x86_64 2.6.13 kernel

   Has anyone reported the following? For both of the 2.6.13 based
kernels released so far on Fedora Core 4 for x86_64, we are seeing
error messages of the form...
Oct  3 11:21:48 XXXXX  kernel:   MEM window: d0200000-d02fffff
Oct  3 11:21:48 XXXXX  kernel:   PREFETCH window: disabled.
Oct  3 11:21:48 XXXXX  kernel: PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #6:20000 f0000000 for 0000:09:00.0
...on a Sun W2100Z dual opteron. These memory allocations errors 
don't occur under the 2.6.12 based kernels that Fedora has released 
for FC4. So far the errors don't seem to be manifesting themselves 
as any noticable system errors in using the machine itself.
