Agreed, but what if your EISA-PCI bridge has only 30 address lines wired
to PCI? Yes, we can check this for EISA device because it has *real*
PCI parent (thanks, Marc :-), but what about ISA/legacy/whatever drivers?
I doubt that all of them bother to set dma_mask pointer (so you can have
an oops there).
