Well, forget this, I'm nuts. I'm sorry, but I did not set any of the -R
and -S parameter on ocbench, which means that all the processes ran at
full speed and did not sleep. The load distribution was not fair, but
since they put a lot of stress on the X server, I think it might be one
of the reasons for the unfairness. I got the same behaviour with -v17,
-v9 and even 2.4 ! It told me something was wrong on my side ;-)
I've retried with 50%/50% run/sleep, and it now works like a charm. It's
perfectly smooth with both small and long run/sleep times (between 1 and 100
ms). I think that with X saturated, it might explain why I only had one CPU
running at 100% !
Next time, I'll try to take a bit more time for such a test.

OK I got it, but I've not run it since the problem was between the keyboard
and the chair. If you want an output anyway, I can give it a run.
Sorry again for the wrong alert.
