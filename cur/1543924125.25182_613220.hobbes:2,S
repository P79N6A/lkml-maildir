But you didn't post the log messages, so I haven't seen them.  
In addition, that "wrong number of endpoints" message occurs long after 
the underlying problem; it's probably not connected.

Can you post the /proc/bus/usb/devices entry under that kernel?  Do
both configurations show up?

Why shouldn't the core ever get to parse the second configuration
descriptor?  Config descriptor parsing happens before driver matching
and binding.  It has to; otherwise the core wouldn't know which 
configuration to install by default.
In the "working" 2.6.23 kernel there were two configurations and Config
#2 was installed.  What happens if you install Config #1 under that
kernel (echo 1 >/sys/bus/usb/devices/.../bConfigurationValue)?
Presumably if Config #2 was present and installed in the "non-working"  
2.6.24-rc1 kernel, the driver would bind correctly.

Then you're concerned about the wrong question.  It's more important to 
find out why Config #2 disappeared under 2.6.24-rc1.  The commit you 
are focused on would not have caused it.

I have no idea what versions of your dongle are available.  In fact, I 
never heard of it before reading your email messages.  However if you 
have had two different dongles that report different idProduct values, 
it's a safe bet that _something_ has changed between them.  The 
firmware, if nothing else.
