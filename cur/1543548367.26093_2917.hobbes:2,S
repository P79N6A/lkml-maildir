Hi Juan,
  is your machine near to VMware or not? I reported same oopses
last week on linux-kernel - they happened after heavy swapped VMware session
on VMware exit (when exit_mmap was cleaning up address space). If you
have idea where mapping gets set to NULL (and why is such page passed
to filemap_write_page), I'd like to know it.
                                          Thanks,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
                                            vandrove@vc.cvut.cz
