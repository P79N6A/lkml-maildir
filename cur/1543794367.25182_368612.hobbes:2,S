Subject: [Patch 0/2] 2.6.15-rc1-mm2: disabling the pagecache for doing benchmarks

For doing some benchmarks on the block-layer especially for the
I/O-Schedulers I thought it would be very useful, to turn off the
pagecache.
Therefore I implemented a global integer as bool for toggling it on and
off.
If "pagecache" is set "1" everything works as normal.
If it's set to "0" the pagecache is disabled by marking all pages as
not-uptodate to force the pagecache to load them again.
In the next step I wrote a module to get access to this bool via the
proc-fs.
It would be very nice if anybody could have a look on it.
Thanks
