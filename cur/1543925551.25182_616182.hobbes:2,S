I don't have an P5B @work, but i guess MSI cooks with water too. :-)
But i have a (1 year old) P5B @home and it is exactly like you said.
My main point is still the same, if Linux could force AHCI mode, i 
wouldn't have to switch between those modes when booting Wintendo to 
play some games. (And i could use AHCI @work where i can't switch it in 
BIOS)
On a side note, with the mainboard i had before the P5B (ASUS, 925X 
Chipset, ICH 6 or 7) Linux worked in AHCI-mode and Wintendo worked also 
without problems. (IOW: I did not need to switch modes in BIOS!)
