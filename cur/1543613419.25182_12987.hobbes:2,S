Doesn't init use kill -15 -1, kill -9 -1, etc., to terminate all
processes?  Hmm.  Yes, it does, but the kernel checks for (pid > 1).
By removing the single compare in the kernel, we're potentially
increasing the size of userspace applications from a single syscall to a
whole walking of /proc just to kill other running processes.  Ugh.
"kill -STOP -1" is also great for freezing forkbombs which would no
longer possible with the /proc method.
