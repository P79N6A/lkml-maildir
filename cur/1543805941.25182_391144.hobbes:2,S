Subject: OSS driver removal, a slightly different approach (v3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

My proposal to remove OSS drivers where ALSA drivers for the same
hardware exists had two reasons:
1. remove obsolete and mostly unmaintained code
2. get bugs in the ALSA drivers reported that weren't previously
   reported due to the possible workaround of using the OSS drivers
I'm slowly getting more and more reports for the second case.
The list below divides the OSS drivers into the following three
categories:
1. ALSA drivers for the same hardware
2. ALSA drivers for the same hardware with known problems
3. no ALSA drivers for the same hardware
My proposed timeline is:
- shortly before 2.6.16 is released:
  adjust OBSOLETE_OSS_DRIVER dependencies to match exactly the
  drivers under 1.
- from the release of 2.6.16 till the release of 2.6.17:
  approx. two months for users to report problems with the ALSA
  drivers for the same hardware
- after the release of 2.6.17 (and before 2.6.18):
  remove the subset of drivers marked at OBSOLETE_OSS_DRIVER without
  known regressions in the ALSA drivers for the same hardware
To make a long story short:
If you are using an OSS driver because the ALSA driver doesn't work
equally well on your hardware, send me an email with a bug number in the
ALSA bug tracking system now.
A small FAQ:
Q: But OSS is kewl and ALSA sucks!
A: The decision for the OSS->ALSA move was four years ago.
   If ALSA sucks, please help to improve ALSA.
Q: What about the OSS emulation in ALSA?
A: The OSS emulation in ALSA is not affected by my patches
   (and it's not in any way scheduled for removal).

2. ALSA drivers for the same hardware with known problems
DMASOUND_PMAC
- Olaf Hering regarding regressions in SND_POWERMAC:
  Some tumbler models work only after one plug/unplug cycle of
  the headphone. early powerbooks report/handle the mute settings
  incorrectly. there are likely more bugs.
SOUND_AD1816
- ALSA #1301 (Kernel OSS emulation stops working after a few seconds
              when used with VoIP softphones)
SOUND_EMU10K1
- ALSA #1735 (OSS emulation 4-channel mode rear channels not working)
- ALSA #1782 (really poor sound with my SB Live 1024 and ALSA)
SOUND_ES1371
- ALSA #1774 (missing joystick connector support for PCI Ensoniq ES1371) (*)
SOUND_ICH
- ALSA #1764 (Recording signal quality is inacceptable (using OSS API))
- Alan Cox:
  ALSA driver lacks "support for AC97 wired touchscreens and the like"
SOUND_NM256
- ALSA #328 (snd-nm256 freezes Dell Latitude LS)
SOUND_TRIDENT
- ALSA #1293 (device supported by OSS but not by ALSA)
- maintainer of the OSS driver wants his driver to stay
3. no ALSA drivers for the same hardware
