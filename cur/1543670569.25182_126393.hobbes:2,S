Actually what I was suggesting was even simpler - in the unlikely
event that we were talking about an MFM or similar interface disk that
_was_ basically like a big floppy, and did no error correction of it's
own, we _could_ reserve, say, one sector per track, and create a 
fault tollerant device that substituted the spare sector in the event
of a write fault.
The overhead would probably be exactly zero, becuase nobody would
actually compile the feature in and use it :-).
John.
