I like it as is. most of the time I convert it into ticks, but sometimes 
I just need the cycles.
Another reason not to postprocess is that it gives userspace more 
freedom in how accurate they want to use the cycle time. I'm probably 
going to throw away the seconds field altogether, because one second is 
a huge timeframe in my application. Throwing away the seconds field 
saves me quite some calculations.
