"lots of work" has never been a valid reason for not doing a kernel 
change...
In this case, introducing a new API means the changes can be made over time.
As time goes on you can convert more and more code to the mutex/sleep 
lock and any tricky code just stays with the older API until someone who 
understands it can vet it.
As Alan mentioned, the standard counting semaphore API is up/down. 
Making those refer to a sleeping mutex violates the principle of least 
surprise.
