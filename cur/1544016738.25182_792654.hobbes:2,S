I just have a local branch, "emergency-fixes" which just reverts
commits ad7a953c and 9bb48247, which I pull in before doing full
builds.  
You can also work around the bug by disabling CONFIG_MODVERSIONS; one
of my build configurations has almost no modules at all but it still
had CONFIG_MODVERSIONS disabled, so for my sniff tests build of
mainline where I don't want to pull in the emergency-fixes branch,
I've also dealt with the situation by disabling CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.
These are both hacks, but they do work around the problem...
