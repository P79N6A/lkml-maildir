kill_fasync receives the _address_ of the variable that contains the 
list of processes that need notifications. It must not be NULL. (I 
assume you look at 2.4 or 2.5 - 2.2 had a different interface)
Check linux/drivers/char/busmouse.c for an example, the interface is 
simple: call fasync_helper to register and kill_fasync for the actual 
notification.
