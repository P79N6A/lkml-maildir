Hi,
> - BLKSSZGET added in common.h
Why don't we give BLKSSZGET a new number and make the old one obsolete? I
don't think it's used anywhere, as its result is pretty useless in
userspace (and even if it's used somewhere, they have to copy the define
anyway). This way we don't need that version check.
bye, Roman
