I have a USB libertas 1286:2001 with bcdDevice 30.06 (from lsusb -v).
I tried downloading the firmware from marvell:
https://www.marvell.com/drivers/driverDisplay.do?dId=160&pId=38
renaming and to usb8388.bin and putting it in firmware dir. Is this
the right firmware??
Upon load this is what I get:

I'm using the compatibility package from:
http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Download
on 2.6.22. So this driver reflects what's on
wireless2.6.git#everything. I tried looking on the wiki but well can't
find much information. Can we please start adding some info about this
driver to:
