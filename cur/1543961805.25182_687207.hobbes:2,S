Yes, it's a nice cleanup.

Hold off for now.  Given that its effects are unmeasured, I'm not even 
sure its the right thing to do.  For example, it will yield if you're 
sending an IPI to a vcpu which wants to run but can't, but does nothing 
for an idle vcpu.  And always yielding may be a performance problem if 
the IPI doesn't involve any cpu contention.
It's easy to add back if it turns out to be useful.
