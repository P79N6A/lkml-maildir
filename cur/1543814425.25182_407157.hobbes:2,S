The error is as followings.

The code seems to define its own msi_ops but never include a
definition of struct msi_ops.
I think this is a sign that some part of arch/ia64/sn/pci/msi.c
should move to something like drivers/pci/msi-sgi-sn.c.
I leave it to SGI developers, who should have a good insight on
what the proper fix is. Mark?
If such fix doesn't come up soon, the attached patch can be
a band-aid.
Thanks,
