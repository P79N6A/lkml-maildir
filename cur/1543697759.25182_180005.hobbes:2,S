Those are still the same good old issues, you have to disable SLAB
debugging unfortunately, at least until there is a better fix, but
so far there isn't.

Ok.

Ok.

Yup, known. My 8500 is sitll on the boat from france and I had my
time lately taken 200% by the G5 port.

Known.

It's a problem. The SCSI stack is passing us unaligned buffers when slab
debugging is enabled, thus triggering a HW issue with those unaligned
buffers (the chip writes before the beginning of the buffer)

I'd appreciate if you could track it down as I won't have access to the
8500 for a few weeks still.

Ok.
