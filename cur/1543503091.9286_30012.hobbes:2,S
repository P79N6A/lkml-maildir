Hi Ingo,
My post is not against your 4 macros that are probably good if we consider
them as just basic stuff. But, FYI, there are about 247 hits of your
macros in 2.2.9 and 240 of them involves jiffies.
People who want to help debugging should also send their patches to the 
maintainer. They just have to look into the header of the source file.
Failing to do so may lead to unnecessary burden. For example:
- I will have to waste time fixing my incremental patch series.
- I have been an idiot each time I claimed that people could apply 
  patches for 2.2.9 to 2.2.10. This just occurred, by the way.
As you know, there is still some FS corruption problem that haven't been 
cleared up in 2.2.10, based on reports I see at the list. Since drivers 
are often suspected in that process, I had decided not to send patches 
except real bug fixes until we will have a real handle on the problem.
I still appeared as a complete idiot, each time I have written that.
At the moment, I have been reported that a system has PCI parity problems 
with 2.2.10-ac10, but works under 2.2.10-ac10 using drivers from 2.2.9.
The changes between these 2 versions seem not correlated with the problem, 
but they add useless confusion.
I have patches for both 2.2.X and 2.3.X (large) that wait for the FS
corruption problem to be cleared up. Mixing useless changes does not help
track such a serious problem, in my opinion. 
Among the diff between 2.2.9 and 2.2.10-ac10 that involve ncr/sym drivers,
only the 2 lignes that address Alpha are fixes. Other ones are not fixes 
at all and so should have been defferred.
Regards,
   Gérard.
