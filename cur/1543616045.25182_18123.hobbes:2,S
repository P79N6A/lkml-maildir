Dear all,
 From 2.4.14, the SetPageDecrAfter() in mm.h is gone.... also it is now 
not called in rw_swap_page_base() in paeg_io.c . The PG_decr_after (5) 
flag is now dissappeared. Now the 5 is replaced with something called 
PG_unused in mm.h . What's the meaning of both? Also the 
rw_swap_page_base() now doesn't check rw==WRITE and where does the WRITE 
handles? Thanks.
David
