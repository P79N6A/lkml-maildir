I'll admit I'm slow, but since it has taken me a number of weeks to sort
out exactly the details of what is being done in your implementation,
and I *still* have bugs after re-implementing it, I'd not claim your
code is simple. The potential to be very precise and efficient: yes, but
not so trivial to follow.
(This is why I cringe at the idea of trying to implement it for each
clock like you're prototype suggested.)
Maybe when I send out the patch you can suggest improvements to the
comments or other ways to better clarify the code as you suggested
above.

I'd be very much open to it, although I haven't seen any further updates
to the code since I mailed you some feedback on them. Have you had a
chance to follow up on those?

Well, I'm still cautious, since it still has some dependencies on HZ
(see equation below), which I'm trying to avoid. However I don't think
your patches keep me from getting the info I need (or atleast, the info
I think I need ;). They do seem to help close the gap between what I
want and what you want, so I think they are a good step forward.

My test patch does this already, although for now it calculates the ntp
interval (something like "tick_nsec + time_adj" in your code) from the
ppm value. That calculation would hopefully be replaced w/ some
ntp_get_interval() call that would pull the equivalent from your code.

If you think they're ready, mail them to the list and I'll look them
over then take a swing at re-basing my work on top of them.
