Most of the difference between "workstation" and "server" is parameter tuning,
not kernel code.  This is true even of NT, where (aside from bundled software)
the primary difference is registry entries which tune various parameters.
And most of the "kernel bloat" is device drivers.  I can *almost* see some
point in splitting off e.g. SCSI or sound trees --- except that every time I
do something like that with my own code, I end up regretting it.  It's one
of those "nice in theory" things....

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
