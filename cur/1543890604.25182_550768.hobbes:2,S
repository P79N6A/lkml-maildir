I just missed the point that leXX_to_cpu() and cpu_to_leXX() are
identical on BE machine anyway. But then why you think it should be
le_16_cpu() -- how will this make any difference?
For your ref (from big_endian.h):
#define __cpu_to_le16(x) ((__force __le16)__swab16((x)))
#define __le16_to_cpu(x) __swab16((__force __u16)(__le16)(x))
