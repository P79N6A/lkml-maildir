ENOMEM would not be any better than EAGAIN from the security standpoint.
The problem is that there are lots of privileged userspace programs that
do not bother to check the return value from set*uid() calls (or
otherwise check that the calls succeeded) before proceeding with work
that is only safe to do with the *uid switched as intended.
