The thing is, we'd just have been much better off if Intel had just 
specified some perfectly regular interrupt for a "power management event", 
coming out of a PCI device for that thing (say, the southbridge?), and 
just tried to standardize it.
We'd have far fewer bugs that way. As it is, we need to often know about 
how the hardware works _anyway_, just to fix up the problems that not 
knowing about it causes.
