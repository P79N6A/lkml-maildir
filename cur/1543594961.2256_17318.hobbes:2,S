In my opinion Linus was already too late when he decided to allow
binary-only drivers. At that time there were already way too many
principal authors that contributed to the kernel, and not all authors
of all files might have agreed with his decision.
But then again: IANAL and this is a legal issue, so Alan is right:
consult a lawyer.
