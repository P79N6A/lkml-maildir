Just .02 from the peanut gallery -
It would be interesting if you were to compare and
contrast 2.4.17-preempt with 2.4.17-low-latency.
I find the low latency patch makes a noticeable
difference in e.g. q3a and rtcw - OTOH I have
not been able to discern any tangible difference
from the stock kernel when using -preempt.
