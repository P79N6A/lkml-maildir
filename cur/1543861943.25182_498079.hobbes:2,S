The case I'm discussing is multiple filehandles for the same name,
not even for different hardlinks.  This causes spurious EIO errors
on the client when the filehandle changes and cache inconsistency
when opening the file multiple times in parallel.

It's not difficult at all, just that the client can't rely on the fileids to be
unique in both space and time because of server non-compliance (e.g. netapp's
snapshots) and fileid reuse after delete.
