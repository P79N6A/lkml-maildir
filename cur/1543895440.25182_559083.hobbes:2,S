What if we pass a signalfd to another process with unix socket? Which signals
should be dequeued in that case? Only shared ones?
I tried to follow this discussion, but I can't understans why the current
behaviour is bad.
Yes, a thread has to create its own signalfd if it wants to dequeue private
signals. But this is simple and understandable. May be I missed something
else ?
