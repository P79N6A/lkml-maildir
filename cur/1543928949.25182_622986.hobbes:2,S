I don't like this -- it shouldn't be necessary.
The 'uaddr' field represents the magic 'unlock address'; the address to
which you have to send a sequence of write cycles before you're allowed
to send certain commands.
Although we can use 16-bit chips in 8-bit mode, the unlock address
doesn't change when we do that -- it's still the same levels on the same
pins of the address bus. Having an array of uaddr[] in the chip
definition was a mistake, and that 'assert' you've just removed for your
board was added within a few months of Thayne doing the array thing. I
really should have followed up by _removing_ the array again, by now. 
We _used_ to mangle (shift) the unlock address based on the mode, but
now we don't (I turned that off at the same time I added the above
assert. I think the definition in the table for the LV800TA is wrong,
and it should be 
                        [0] = MTD_UADDR_0x0555_0x02AA,
