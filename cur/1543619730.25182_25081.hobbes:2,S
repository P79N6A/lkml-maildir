Subject: O_DIRECT fails in some kernel and FS

After some comments from Oliver Diedrich (editor of heise.de), which told me 
he couldn't make O_DIRECT work on 2.4.17, I tried with different versions and 
file systems:
This is the result:
2.4.14 - Ext[23] - redhat7.2 glibs: OK (at least the bytes are written)
2.4.17 - ReiserFS - Debian Sid    : FAILS (0 bytes file, write returns -1)
2.4.17 - Ext2 - Debian Woody      : OK (bytes written)
2.4.17 - Ext3 - Debian Woody      : FAILS (0 bytes file, write returns -1)
Oliver Diedrich also told he could make work O_DIRECT with ext3 and 2.4.17. 
Is this normal? Does it really work on 2.4.14? Or it doesn't but the kernel 
doesn't avoid caching?
Funny behaviour...
Regards,
