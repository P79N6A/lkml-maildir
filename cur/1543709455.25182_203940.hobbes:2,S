lazy kernel: Assertion failure in __journal_drop_transaction() at
checkpoint.c:587: "transaction->t_ilist == NULL"
Networking still works, I've tried to login, but no luck here.
I've got one ssh console opened, and tried to reboot, but nothing happend, it
looks like it lost connection with hda :(
Where should I look for reason?
Machine as faaar away, and it's second or third time it hangs mysteriously,
the only difference is that this time I've got some console output.
