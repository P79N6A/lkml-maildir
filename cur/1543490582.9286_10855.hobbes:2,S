You (and many others) state that like a religious belief. I suppose I
would choose that over the newbie idea that every feature needs to be
in the kernel, but they are equally mindless ideas.
It turns out that the proper solution (binfmt_misc) is already in the
kernel where it belongs. Few people would seriously accept the need
to specify an interpreter before each script.
