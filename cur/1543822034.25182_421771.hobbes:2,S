Look, it's me who's using that and I tell you I want just that :-)

And would you trust a binary which doesn't have "/dev/mem" string
in it?
Anyway you can compile it yourself if you want. It's not about trust,
it's about simplicity and robustness.

Sure. If the driver is loaded/available. What if, say, the
distribution you use doesn't have it?

So what? The driver and EEPROM updater don't conflict.

It will not load with blank or invalid EEPROM :-)

Because?

It has nothing to do with any "ROM".
