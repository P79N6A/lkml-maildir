Uhh. I asked MUCH simplier question: why devices are named
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part2
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part3
but on bootup you'll see:
-- cut --
SCSI device sda: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 35841015 [17500 MB] [17.5 GB]
 /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0: p1 p2 p3
-- cut --
Of course it's just cosmetic but IMHO better to use partX in all places or
pX in old places to avaoid confusions...
