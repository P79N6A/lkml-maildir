I'm not entirely clear on what you are alluding to here, are you
referring to SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND?  There's significantly more
functionality embedded within the IOCTLs than simply sending passthrus
to devices.  Also, all of QLogic's drivers (linux, solaris, windows)
implement to this 'external ioctl' spec, making changes to Linux alone
would difficult.
