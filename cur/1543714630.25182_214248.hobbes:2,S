Yes, but I'm not talking about follow_hugetlb_page() (my patch doesn't
touch it).  I'm talking about follow_huge_addr() and
follow_huge_pmd().  These are called to implement follow_page().  In
get_user_pages(), follow_pages() is bypassed bu the call to
follow_hugetlb_page(), but these extra get_pages() are presumably a
bug if follow_page() is called on a hugepage from somewhere other than
get_user_pages().
So I think my patch is correct.

Ah, that's useful to know.
