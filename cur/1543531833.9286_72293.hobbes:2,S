Hello,
Just noticed after doing a 'ping6 ::1' ( and thereby
autoloading ipv6 module):
 # lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
<snip>
ipv6                  117152  -1  (autoclean)
<snip>
This is with kernel 2.3.99-3 (+lvm patch), "anything" as module.
I noticed a few MOD_INC_USE_COUNT macro's in ipv6.c but no
MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT, but that -1 has to come from somewhere... (not yet
figured out)
it seems to be only a minor issue, but i don't want to hold it for myself
:)
Greatings,
