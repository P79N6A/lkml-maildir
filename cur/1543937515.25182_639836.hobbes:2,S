I take it different also means it does not show this odd performance
behaviour and is similar whether the patch is applied or not?

With 8GiB of RAM, try making 24 copies of the kernel and compiling them
all simultaneously. Running that for for 20-30 minutes should be enough to
randomise the freelists affecting what color of page is used for the dd test.
