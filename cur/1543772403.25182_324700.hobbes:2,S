Subject: [RFC] Patch series to remove devfs [00/22]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

As everyone knows[1], devfs is going to be removed from the kernel soon.
To accomplish this, here is a series of patches (22 in all) that do just
that.  Surprisingly enough, devfs was almost everywhere in the kernel,
that's why it takes so many patches :)
Anyway, here's the whole series against 2.6.12-rc6-git4.  If some of
them don't make it through to lkml (due to size restrictions, or just
failing on a "taste" filter), you can find them all at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-05-devfs/
along with a quilt series file to apply them with.
Andrew, please do not pick these up for your -mm tree.  Odds are it will
just cause too many conflicts to make it worth your while :)
Comments welcome.
Oh, and the best part?  Here's the summary of the diffstat:
  222 files changed, 112 insertions(+), 8545 deletions(-)
It's nice to remove code from the kernel for a change...
thanks,
greg k-h
