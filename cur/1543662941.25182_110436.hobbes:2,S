This is, how things worked for me:
1. Kernel tries to mount rootfs ext3. If this fails, it will continue
trying ext2. No other fs compiled into kernel.
2. If there is a journal, it is ext3.
3. Init scripts read /etc/fstab and read ext2.
4. root is remounted as ext2.
5. System allows me to log it, root is ext2, life is good.
Where is your behaviour different from this list? Where do you say you
want ext2 but don't get it?
