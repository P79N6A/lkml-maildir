Hello,
So what's the status of this? Dave can you still reproduce hangs with
your last jfs fixes applied?
Valids did you test my last patch (you find it in my ftp area) that
removes the unstable pages from the equation? all ext3 as local fs ok,
but do you use nfs for the networked fs? If not can you post a way to
reproduce the hang? Is it enough to boot with mem=256M?
Thanks.
