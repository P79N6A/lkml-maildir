That statement is unfair and silly. Don't be duped by the slick
veneer MS marketing put on (often) crufty merchandise. 
Linux's dirty linen is hanging out there for all the world to see.
MS's dirty linen is stashed away in a locked cupboard. They only
show you what they want you to see, and only tell you what they
think you want to hear. Where's the NT-kernel development
newsgroup?
