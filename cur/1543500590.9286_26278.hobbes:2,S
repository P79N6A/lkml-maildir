Well, I understand you have _another_ problem now.  But at first,
could you please let me know if my patch stops the OOPS (the message
"Aiee, killing interrupt handler...") or not?
And for the problem you encountered, I'd like to know the situation
more.  Could you please let me know what will be happened when you do:
 > 1.    I boot both machines.
 > 1a.   I bring up plip on both sides.
 > 1b.   Plip works fine.
 > 
 > 2.    I drop plip on both sides.
 > 
 > 3.    I bring up plip on both sides.
 > 3a.   Plip appears to come up on both sides, as indicated via ifconfig.
 > 3b.   Plip does not work.
 > 3b1.  When pinging from julia (6.0/2.2.10), timeouts occur on ranma
 > (5.2/2.0.36).
 > 3b2.  When pinging from ranma, timeouts occur on ranma.
4'.  Test on "julia"
4'a.  drop plip on julia
4'b.  rmmod plip on julia
4'c.  insmod plip on julia
4'd.  bring up plip julia
4'e.  ping from julia, ping from ramma.
Does it works?
4''.  Another Test on "julia"
4''a.  drop plip on julia
4''b.  rmmod plip on julia *and* rmmod parport_pc on julia
4''c.  insmod parport_pc on julia *and* insmod plip on julia
4''d.  bring up plip julia
4''e.  ping from julia, ping from ramma.
Does it works?
It seems for me that it is resource allocation/management problem wrt
parport.  Perhaps I don't know well about usage of parport. I'll look
at the API of parport again.
Thank you for cooperation,
