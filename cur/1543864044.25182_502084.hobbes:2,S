For the jumbo frame problem, only the antifragmentation approach of 
clustering types of pages together in MAX_ORDER blocks has any chance of 
helping.

Worse, the problem is to have high order contiguous blocks free at the 
time of allocation without reclaim or migration. If the allocations were 
not atomic, anti-fragmentation as it is today would be enough.
By clustering atomic allocations together though, I would expect the jumbo 
frames to be allocated and freed within the same area without interference 
from other allocation types as long as min_free_kbytes was also set higher 
than default. I lack the hardware to prove/disprove the idea though.

The zone-based approach does nothing to help jumbo frame allocations. It 
only helps hugepage allocations at runtime and potentially memory 
hot-remove.
