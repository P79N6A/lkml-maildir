Subject: 2.6.15-rc2 pci_ids.h cleanup is a pain

I'm sure I'm not the only person that applies patches to the kernel that 
use some of the 500 plus PCI IDS eliminated from pci_ids.h by rc2.  I 
would like to see the PCI ids that were removed simply because the don't 
occur in the main kernel source restored.  Is there a rationale for 
removing them that I'm not aware of?
