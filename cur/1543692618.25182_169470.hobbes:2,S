The shortlogs are automatically generated, and I sometimes edit them to be 
slightly more readable by hand.
What this means is that if you want a human-readable short-log, then your
ALSA log message itself should be human-readable, and not that automated
crap.
So instead of your CVS merges doing this crap:

Why don't you just make the BK log something sane instead, ie
	RawMidi Midlevel: fixed typos (open_lock -> open_mutex).
	Bt Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>
(the "F:" is useless, since the files already show up in any sane source 
control, and the rest is just fluff.
