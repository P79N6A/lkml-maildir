That isn't what Mauro is saying.  What he is saying is that the missing
symbols will not be reported at build time.  The kernel will all link
correctly and will appear to load modules correctly.
See, there's a third mechanism for symbol resolution which is used at
runtime, not at build time: symbol_request().
What Mauro is saying is that these changes will cause symbol_request() to
return different results on some people's setups with different hardware,
causing those setups to fail.
