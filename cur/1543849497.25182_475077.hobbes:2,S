yes.  At least for Acer Travelmate 8000 and HP nx6310 and HP nx7400.
Other than the touchpad - there is not a lot of common hardware between
these units.   The readout becomes highly unreliable.   (in X it starts
jumping around - it SORT OF resembles the output)
My suspicion is a timing problem in the synaptic USB driver - but I'm
not familiar with timing on kernels these days.  It's been a few years
since I last really did any kernel work.

Fails to boot some of the time on SanDisk ultraII 8.0GB and SanDisk
Extreme IV 8.0GB.   The latter is less stable.   It crashes during GRUB
read actually so I haven't been entirely sure it's a kernel problem...

A regression.   2.6.19-rc1-git6 seemed to work actually.   I couldn't
get any other kernel to work though...   mind you, 2.6.18 worked as well
although the intel 945G driver did not - so X was operating under VESA only.

As far as I can it never has.
I've only tested it with:
2.6.16-debian, 2.6.17-debian, 2.6.18, 2.6.19, 2.6.19-rc1,
2.6.19-rc1-git4, 2.6.19-rc1-git6, 2.6.19-rc2, 2.6.19-rc2-mm1 (which
otherwise works quite nicely)
Thank you!
