Subject: [RFC PATCH 6/6] relay: add relay_reset_consumed()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/29/316

This patch allows relay channels to be reset i.e. unconsumed.
Basically allows a 'rewind' function for flight-recorder tracing.

+The read(2) implementation always 'consumes' the bytes read,
+i.e. those bytes won't be available again to subsequent reads.
+Certain applications may nonetheless wish to allow the 'consumed' data
+to be re-read; relay_reset_consumed() is provided for that purpose -
+it resets the internal consumed counters for all buffers in the
+channel.  For example, if a first set of reads 'drains' the channel,
+and then relay_reset_consumed() is called, a second set of reads will
+get the exact same data (assuming no new data was written between the
+first set of reads and the second).

 Finally, there are a couple of utility callbacks that can be used for
 different purposes.  buf_mapped() is called whenever a channel buffer
 is mmapped from user space and buf_unmapped() is called when it's
