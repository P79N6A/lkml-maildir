You could make a null DRM driver that is loaded for every card that
doesn't have a real one. Give it aliases to make it match the X driver
names.
The right answer here is to start working towards a solution where the
OS is actually in control of hardware resources instead of a user app.
There can only be one entity in charge of PCI space or we will all go
insane. If we continue to say that old X binaries have to work we will
still have these same problems in 2060.
