There seems to be a problem with mptscsih under 2.6.5 through 
2.6.7-rc2 when it is run on a dual Opteron based machine and a 
LSI21040 card. It doesn't make the attached disk available. It won't 
show up in /proc/scsi/scsi.
With sym53c8xx and 2.6.5 on this same machine, the drive attached to 
the card shows up just fine.
mptscsih does work under a Xeon based system 2.6.6 and a LSI20320-R card.
