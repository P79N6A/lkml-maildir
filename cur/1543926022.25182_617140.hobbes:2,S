Tests would of course be nice, but they aren't very useful(!)
Looking at this list which Natalie has generated I see around thirty which
are dependent on the right hardware and ten which are not.  This ratio is
typical, I think.  In fact I'd say that more than 75% of reported bugs are
dependent on hardware.
So the best test of all for the kernel is "run it on a different machine". 
This is why we are sooooo dependent upon our volunteer testers/reporters to
be able to do kernel development.

Sure.  For system-call-visible features it would be good to do that.
But this tends not to be where bugs get exposed.  Because the original
developer can 100% exercise such code.  That isn't the case with
driver/arch/platform changes.

We're 100% dead if "having the hardware" is a prerequisite to fixing a bug.
The terminal state there is that the kernel runs on about 200 machines
worldwide.  We have to work with reporters via email to fix these sorts of
things.  As we of course do.

Yes.  An unknown number of people just shrug and go back to an old kernel.
