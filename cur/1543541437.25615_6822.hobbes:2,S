AMD's specs for their new 64bit processor are out now, and on
http://www.sandpile.org
This processor is a 64 bit extension of the Intel x86 ia32 architecture.
I had a look at the stuff and it looks very cool.
Anyone start porting Linux to the new chip yet?  Since Red Hat has an ia64
port allready in beta for a chip that isn't available yet, I thought it
would be very cool if the same were to occur for The AMD aa64 architecture
as well.
A while back when someone mentioned it, I believe Alan Cox said it would
be very easy to add native 64 bit Linux support for AMD's new chip.  I am
just wondering if anyone had NDA and was working on it, or now that it is
out people can start working on it.  It would be very cool to see it added
sometime soon.  The chip appears to be incredibly backward compatible, and
has many new registers (16 64bit regs + the usual register overlapping
down to 32/16/8, etc...)  I'm sure x86 software will fly bigtime on this
new processor both legacy 32bit as well as new 64 bit stuff.
Anyone know of a URL of anyone working on this port?
