Yes. GNU emacs. Bloated and ugly like hell. gcc. Codebase is anything but
pretty. Your point being? And no, it's not trolling. RMS really got no
taste - read his postings on _technical_ GNU lists and see yourself.
Crap can work. Given enough thrust pigs will fly, but it's not necessary a
good idea.
$DEITY witness, we've got enough ugly code, but compared to the average
level of GNU codebase kernel looks wonderful. Sorry. I think that I've
spent enough time dealing with both to be able to compare.
