Of course it's not a realistic expectation. There are times when it's a pain
to have to be safe - people will always break the rules when they're in a
hurry and the document to be sent is already in an unsafe format. But taking
plain text with absolutely no formatting, in fact text which is
_degenerated_ by word wrapping &c, and gratuitously putting it in a Word
document is just _so_ unnecessary that I assumed it had to be a troll.

The kind of error you're seeing is often caused by a mismatch between 
compiler and kernel. As Alan suggests, you should make sure you're using a 
PPC-specific tree because it's not up to date in the stock 2.4.3. And make 
sure you're using the recommended versions of compiler and binutils. Other 
than that, I'm afraid I don't know.
