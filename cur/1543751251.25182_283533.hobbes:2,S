The timeouts are for:
a) A fallback for backing stores which don't wake up waiters in
   blk_congestion_wait() (eg: NFS).
b) handling the race case where the request queue suddenly goes empty
   before the sleeper gets onto the waitqueue.
It can probably be removed with some work, and additional locking.
