Where does it say that an fs is not allowed to give you this information in

And if you completely run out of ideas in your wild-mounts-throughout-the-tree
problem you should simply use "tar -l".
And in just the same way fs could provide a mode bit saying "hi, I am a
hardlink", and tar can then easily provide option number 1345 saying "stay away
from hardlinks".
If you can do the fs patch, I can do the tar patch.
