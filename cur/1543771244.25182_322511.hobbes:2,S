A good thought, and one I had considered. SOME_BIG_NUMBER needs to be 
meaninful for this to work. Ideally what we do is add the effective load from 
the sibling cpu to the pegged cpu. However that's not as useful as it sounds 
because we need to ensure both sibling runqueues are locked every time we 
check the load value of one runqueue, and the last thing I want is to 
introduce yet more locking. Also the value will vary wildly depending on 
whether the task is pegged or not, and this changes in mainline many times in 
less than .1s which means it would throw load balancing way off as the value 
will effectively become meaningless.
I already have a plan for this without really touching the load balancing.
Cheers,
