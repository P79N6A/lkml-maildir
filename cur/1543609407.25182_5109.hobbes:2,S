Broken.
	a) passing inode is an obvious mistake.  dentry or vfsmount/dentry.
	b) for crying out loud, what's that with SGI and ioctl-like abortions?
Rule of the tumb: if your function got a "cmd" argument - it's broken.
ioctl(2).  fcntl(2).  prctl(2).  quotactl(2).  sysfs(2).  Missed'em'V IPC
syscalls.  Enough, already.
	Folks, it's not a rocket science.  Let a function do _one_ thing,
don't turn it into a multiplexed monstrosity.  Yes, you've used only 3
syscalls.  But actually you've managed to hide ~20 of them in that code
and the fact that you've spent only 3 syscall table entries doesn't make
the things better.
	Please, come up with a decent API.
