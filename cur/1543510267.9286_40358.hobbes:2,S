Hello, all...
Seeings-how Alan has produced 2.2.13Pre11 & has asked us to test it, with
IKD, I decided to try it.  The 2.2.12 IKD patch does apply cleanly to
the 13pre11 tree.  Does anybody have a version of the IKD patch that does
apply cleanly so I don't have to dig in and find the differences?  Please?
Thanks
-Nick
