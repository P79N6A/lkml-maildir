It used to, until I found out that that regularly blew up
for people mmap()ing devices and I had to remove that code
again ;)
The reason for that problem is that a device driver would
allocate memory, set PG_reserved on it and then let user
programs mmap() it.
These reserved pages do not get a pte chain because the
memory isn't swappable and if the page stays reserved
page_remove_rmap won't even try searching for the pte
chain.
However, some drivers (nvidia) clear PG_reserved without
first having the programs exit, so page_remove_rmap will
end up searching for the pte chain, which of course
doesn't exist...
Of course, ntpd is probably running into a different problem,
but the printk's enabled with DEBUG_RMAP should give us some
hints.

Rik
