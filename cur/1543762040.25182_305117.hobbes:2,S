The problem is in the journal-replay code and it is triggered by the
reuse of a directory inode by a regular file inode, so reproducing the
bug requires the journal containing both changes to the inode as a
directory and then as a file.
This patch to jfs_fsck fixes the problem.  It wasn't really an issue
with O_SYNC at all, although I believe there are O_SYNC issues that need
to be resolved.  The data itself should be sync'd correctly, as
generic_file_write checks for the O_SYNC flag.  The missing piece in jfs
is that metadata changes to the inode may not always be making it to the
disk when they should.
