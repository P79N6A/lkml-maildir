The only purpose was to convert from K&R style:
int foo(bar, baz)
long bar;
long baz;
{
}
to ANSI C style:
int foo(long bar, long baz)
{
}
The purpose of the above is that Linus's new sparse checker purposefully
ignores K&R style, and he has indicated a willingness to accept patches
for the conversion.  In fact, he began the conversion himself.
If you'd rather me not touch arch/ppc/xmon/ppc-opc.c and xmon.c, then I
won't.  I was about ready to send those patches to you.  Please let me
know what you'd prefer.  The default will be no action. Thanks.
