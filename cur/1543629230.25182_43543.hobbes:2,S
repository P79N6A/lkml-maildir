Ahh, that's a good distinction to make.  I'll be testing CD ripping on this
machine eventually too.
Are you burning CDs at the same time as ripping?  If so, try doing that in a
two step process and see where the problem occours.
Can you post the full output of lspci?  Be sure to mention what drives are
on which controller (if you have two or more).
Can you post the kernel output from dmesg when it detects your drives?
Do you have any ISA devices in this system?
Can you post the commands it takes to reproduce the condition?
Also, `vmstat 1` output while the system is unresponsive would be good too.
Thanks,
Mike
