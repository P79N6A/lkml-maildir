Actually I did see those posts, it's just that I've had the exact same 
problem on uhci and ohci, and because rmmod usb-storage between
unplug and plugin avoided the problem, I figured it was solely usb-storage 
related.
Besides it appears that it's more likely to be just MSystems DiskOnKey 
related, because for example a similar Fujitsu mass storage works without 
problems.

Not about ehci, I did mail here (twice) and to sf usb-devel 
(or usb-users-devel or similar) list, but I was only talking about 
usb-storage module and DiskOnKey because, like I said, it didn't matter 
which Xhci I used, nor on what chipsets I tried it on. Late this summer I 
talked to a person who either worked for msystems (DiskOnKey manufacturer) 
or did business with them, can't remember which, and who had dug up those 
posts, and he sent mails to Matthew Dharm without reply, as far as I know. 
I know that contacting the right people is difficult, and like I said in
my previous post was that I would've looked into this and really tried 
harder, but it's just that I didn't have the time nor the need to
as aliases with the 'rmmod usb-storage' hack avoided the problem with
DiskOnKey devices.
Let me know if you want the panic prints or other tests done. 
I'll try the 2.5.39 out, but I doubt that the results will be any 
different.
