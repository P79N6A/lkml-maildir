These are both well and good, but I was looking for a more global
system (for things other than FUSE).

Yeah, I guess I'm motivated in that I want to use normal mount to
handle v9fs user file systems, local private mounts, and local private
resource shares.  I'd also like normal users to be able to take better
advantage of -o bind.  I think its kinda silly that we have special
purpose mounts for cifs, samba, fuse, v9fs, etc -- but I suppose
that's more of a user-space util-linux dilemma than a kernel dilemma.
