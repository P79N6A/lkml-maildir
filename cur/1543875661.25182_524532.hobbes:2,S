Linux _will_ write all modified data to permanent storage locations.
Since 2.6.17 it will do this regardless of msync().  Before 2.6.17 you
do need msync() to enable data to be written back.
But it will not start I/O immediately, which is not a requirement in
the standard, or at least it's pretty vague about that.
