It has, on sparc32 the hashed spinlock scheme is being used
so it's a full 32-bit counter now.
Well, it's not even 32-bits, it's actually 31-bits since the
value is declared as signed.
Only 64-bit platforms provide the atomic64_t implementation.
We'd need to deal with that before making your suggested
change.
