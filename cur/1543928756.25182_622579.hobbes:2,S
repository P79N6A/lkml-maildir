the header of /proc/latency_trace explains the format:
                 _------=> CPU#
                / _-----=> irqs-off
               | / _----=> need-resched
               || / _---=> hardirq/softirq
               ||| / _--=> preempt-depth
               |||| /
               |||||     delay
   cmd     pid ||||| time  |   caller
      \   /    |||||   \   |   /
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1    0us : ktime_get_ts (ktime_get)
'time' is timestamp in microseconds. Then come the caller (and parent, 
or other, special parameters like the task-pid of the scheduled task). 
It's supposed to be easy to read to kernel hackers - let me know if any 
of the details is non-obvious.
for example:
> >     date-7119  0.... 15636591us!: schedule <bash-502> (0 0)
the task 'date' (pid 7119) scheduled at timestamp 15636591us, and 
switched to another task 'bash' (pid 502). Both had a default nice level 
of 0 [the (0 0) arguments].
