this has to be done carefully though, as there's a subtle detail here: 
right now the pda_irqcount and the pda_irqstackptr logic in entry_64.S is 
not re-entry safe and relies on IRQs being off.
If critical exceptions are moved to the IRQ stack then %rsp switching to 
the IRQ stack has to be done atomically: instead of using the pda_irqcount 
check the %rsp value itself should be checked against pda_irqstackptr - if 
it's within that 16K range then we are already on the IRQ stack and do not 
need to switch to it but can just use the current %rsp.
