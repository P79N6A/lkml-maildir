If you require more details on how this all works - it was fully explored 
in the IETF RDDP workgroup - may I suggest a reading of the RDMA Security 
Considerations draft which goes through many of the issues on how one 
relates to a host stack.   This complements the MPA spec and supports much 
of what Steve has already responded to during this string of e-mails.  We 
took a great deal of time and debate to insure this can work efficiently 
and without confusion in terms of who owns what and when.
