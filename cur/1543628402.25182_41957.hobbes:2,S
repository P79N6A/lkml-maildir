I think you stated that #1 is only 5% silly, by implication, 95% unsilly.
Two out of three ain't bad.

I agree.  (/me listens for sound of garzik hitting floor)  The doc was never
to be removed, it was to be moved.  Read the original mail please.  I repeat:
I *like* your docs, in fact I think they are excellent docs.  I just don't
like to see them sitting in Documentation, for reasons we've been over in
some detail.

I do.  I don't agree with you that any of this has something to do with free 
speech, but I'm willing to accept that you view the kernel source as a kind of
podium.

To this discussion?  Debatable.  I'll go with you on that for now though, and
see where it leads.

It would for me, others mileage may vary.
