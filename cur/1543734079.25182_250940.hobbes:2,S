hi,
has anyone noticed that it's impossible (without hacking) to remove
CONFIG_SERIAL?
remove the entries or set all SERIAL config entries to "n"...
hit make...
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250 gets set to "m", CONFIG_SERIAL gets set to "y"!
seeerrrriiialllll muuuusssstttt dieeeeeee kill kill kill.
actually there is a serious reason: udev at the moment is
taking up a significant amount of startup time (with selinux
enhancements) due to the number of entries to create in /dev.
if the dbus stuff was enabled as well it would be _even longer_.
there are 64 ttys created
there are 64 serial devices created.
only three of these are actually used on my computer - well two at most:
tty0 and tty7.
why in hell's name would i want 128 unnecessary devices created?
i feel a kernel parameter coming on...
l.

around you, funnily and coincidentally enough, life gets a lot better.
