1 - check your cables in case 2.6 is checking (or not) something
2 - set your NIC half to match the switch and see if there's a different 
problem.
Switches and NICs, especially nice new ones, don't always or even 
usually auto-auto, at least with any of the stuff I have. I have one 
system which works well full when the switch negotiates full and the NIC 
gets half. Any other force usually works poorly. If the NIC comes up 
helf just kick it into full in rc.local (ethtool, mii-tool, whatever) as 
long as the switch convinces itself that it's full.
I see this with 2.4 as well, so I'm familiar if not expert.
