Remember that you only need the pci=conf2 to get past the lockup bug
when doing an initial installation from CDROM.  After that, once you
have installed a kernel updated with the patch to alim15x3.c, the need
for it goes away (and in fact, continuing to use pci=conf2 will
actually prevent many of the other devices from being properly
recognized).
