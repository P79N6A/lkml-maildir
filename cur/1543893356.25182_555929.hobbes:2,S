Hi for all!
in linux-2.6.21.1/Documentation/laptop-mode.txt we see this link:
<
http://www.xs4all.nl/~bsamwel/laptop_mode/tools/>
But it not exist.
And this too:
"...which is located in /etc/default/laptop-mode on Debian-based systems..."
But in Debian Etch correct is: /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf
Best regards,
Renato S. Yamane
