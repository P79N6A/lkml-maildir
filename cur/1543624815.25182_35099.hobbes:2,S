Very low. Something like 10 MB reading files on the server. My standard way of producing it is mounting the backup fs and then starting yast (SuSE config tool), which is configured to read the data from (the same) nfs-server. Scroll around in the packet selection a bit and exit the tool without installing something. I cannot see however how YaST mounts the fs (which options on mount command). Maybe someone from SuSE can clarify?

No. They are on different filesystems.

Another point to clarify, my client fstab entry looks like this:
192.168.1.2:/p2/backup  /backup                 nfs     timeo=20,dev,suid,rw,exec,user,rsize=8192,wsize=8192       0 0
I cannot say anything about the second fs mounted via YaST.
