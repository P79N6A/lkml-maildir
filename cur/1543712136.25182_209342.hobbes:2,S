Well, I also think this is grey area.
But think about: why can we distribute assembler only code in linux
kernel?  It's near to binary form (objdump -d is your friend).
If they insist this source code is GPL, then I think this code is
covered under GPL at least for this case.  If it's GPL, then we can
derive the newer firmware code from this original ql2100_fw.c freely.
