Sorry, I didn't realize what you were asking for. Comments re POSIX are
correct, but in that case everything is much worse. What kind of
semantics do you want here? Two dentries for the object at the same
moment? Sorry, no. Especially for directories. Feel free to propose a fix,
indeed, but I'ld be *very* interested if you could find a clean way to do
it. Clean as in "not introducing local DoS holes". It's that serious.
	Case-preserving & case-insentive is a kludge and a bad one. It really
doesn't map on the UNIX semantics and IMO it will always remain a kludge.
Something will not work and lack of feature is better than exploitable
race.
	Again, feel free to provide a clean solution. Frankly, I'm very
sceptical wrt existence of such beast.
