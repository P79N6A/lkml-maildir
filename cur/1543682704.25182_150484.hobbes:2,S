Hi, Greg, list!
Sorry for my english.
I have a usb flash disk (Butterfly, I think).
Also, I have 2 machines, Athlons, 2.4.22pre7 and 2.4.22pre3.
The disk is recognized by both machines as sda1.
I do a mkreiserfs /dev/sda1, mount it and everything works on machine 1.
If I go to machine 2, the kernel cannot recognise a valid reiserfs on the
flash. If I do a mkreiserfs, I can work with it, but when I move to
machine 1, same problem (reiserfs not recognized).
Any ideas?
Thank you very much.
