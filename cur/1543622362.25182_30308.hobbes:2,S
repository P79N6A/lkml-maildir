Me too.  Everybody says "it's the final code that matters", but a lot of
us would be more productive if the thing would just compile faster.  I've
done the same (used 2723 during development/debugging) and it helped
quite a lot.
I remember Borland Turbo Pascal's compiler... Yes, yes, but that thing
compiled insane amounts of code in split seconds on 386 hardware.
