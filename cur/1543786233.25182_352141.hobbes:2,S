Not sure that I'm following the logic here, so...
For one, I leaned towards "p = malloc(sizeof(*p))" before, but the reasons
given for "p = malloc(sizeof struct foo))" (or even "p = (struct foo *)
malloc(sizeof(struct foo))", wrapped in a macro) did convince me.
The gains for a reader/maintainer/code auditor I see:
- It is easier to find it later
- Initialization of *p should be nearby, finding it by type name is useful
  for checking/updating
- It forces you to think a bit before typing it in, this should make making
  mistakes somewhat harder
The loss for a code writer are:
- (Marginally) more typing
- Have to know the type of *p [but if you don't, better don't touch it...]
If the writer has got the type wrong, she will initialize wrongly (and the
compile will blow up), so I don't see any advantage. The only other case
would be something like:
   p = malloc(sizeof(...));
   memset(p, v, sizeof(...));
As v is more often than not 0, this should really be:
   p = calloc(1, sizeof(...));
and perhaps in this case (with /no/ further initialization) it could be
called a tie. For uniformity's sake I'd prefer "sizeof(struct foo)"
everywhere.
In any case, give me help in finding bugs and updating code over (minor)
initial coding convenience everyday.
In any case, as the parallel flamewars conclusively demonstrate, writing it
down in CodingStyle won't make everybody agree on using it anyway, so I'd
vote for including the "sizeof(struct foo)" version there as recommended
practice.
