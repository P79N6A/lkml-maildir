True - thanks - including the part about the cost of locking bugs.
My question was poorly phrased - the code speaks the answer to the
real question I had:
  $ grep define.atomic_ include/asm-ia64/atomic.h | head -2
  #define atomic_read(v)          ((v)->counter)
  #define atomic_set(v,i)         (((v)->counter) = (i))
An atomic_read() of a one word counter on ia64 is just a load, and an
atomic_set() is just a store.  This is unlike the more difficult
atomic_inc, atomic_dec, atomic_add, atomic_mutilate, ... calls that
require something fancier, and I presume more painful for that CPUs
innards.
Good.  Thanks.
