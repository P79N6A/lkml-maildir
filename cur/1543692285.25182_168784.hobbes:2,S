Depends how the application writes the data it's not the amount that is
the problem it's the frequency of the calls.
It should however be possible to meassure the overhead and remove that
from the result.
As far as I know it's not possible to abort a syscall with ptrace on
entry but you can change the syscall number to something harmless like
getpid and fix the return values on exit. But it is all very much arch
dependent code.
