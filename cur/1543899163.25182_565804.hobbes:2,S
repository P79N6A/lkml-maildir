The boot options are different depending on the distribution you are using.
Every distribution has his own magic for this kind things. ( Debian and 
Ubuntu should have a man page with boot parameters )
On kernels with both IDE and PATA enabled as modules , depends on what 
you load first / include in your initramfs.
If you load the IDE subsystem first you get HD*'s while with PATA you 
get SD*'s.
I don't use Debian nor Ubuntu but it looks like Ubuntu has PATA as 
default while Debian has IDE.
