It might not be interrupt related, it could be DMA starvation.  This has
been observed with some SATA controllers while testing the -rt patches.
The symptom is that the latency traces show the machine going in "slow
motion".
Dominique: try the -rt kernel, enable latency tracing and post the
output.
