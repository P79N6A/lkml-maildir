Why is it more acceptable to break large amount of userspace code
just because of a major version change?
Yes, current /proc is a little ugly (internally[0] and externally)
doesn't mean that it doesn't work.  I'm slightly biased because I
didn't have to write "ps" , but the current /proc works fine for my
purposes and, I suspect, most peoples'.

A generic interface might seem a nice idea, but are we really going
to add enough buses (with worthwhile /proc interfaces) to make a
proc_bus_register() really worthwhile?
