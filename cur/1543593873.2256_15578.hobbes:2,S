The 2.4.6-pre2 kernel introduces some new configuration symbols:
CONFIG_AMD7409_OVERRIDE
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_AMD7409
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OSB4
CONFIG_BLUEZ
CONFIG_BLUEZ_HCIEMU
CONFIG_BLUEZ_HCIUART
CONFIG_BLUEZ_HCIUSB
CONFIG_BLUEZ_L2CAP
Would the people responsible for these symbols please write Configure.help
entries and send them to me?  Before this update Configure.help had 
complete coverage; let's try to keep it that way.

sacrifice for that freedom."	-- John F. Kennedy
