You may wish to check the source port which your DNS servers are using
to perform lookups.  I've had a situation recently where someone was
unable to send me mail.  Upon investigation, I found that my name
servers couldn't resolve his domain, but plain 'dig' on the same box
could.
I've come across ISPs who think they should block DNS requests from
certain _source_ ports to "improve" their security, which may explain
what you're seeing.
If this is the case, I suggest Adrian finds a better ISP.
