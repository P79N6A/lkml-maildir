Implement utimensat(2) which is an extension to futimesat(2) in that
it
a) supports nano-second resolution for the timestamps
b) allows to selectively ignore the atime/mtime value
c) allows to selectively use the current time for either atime or mtime
d) supports changing the atime/mtime of a symlink itself along the lines
   of the BSD lutimes(3) functions
For this change the internally used do_utimes() functions was changed to
accept a timespec time value and an additional flags parameter.
Additionally the sys_utime function was changed to match
compat_sys_utime which already use do_utimes instead of duplicating the
work.
