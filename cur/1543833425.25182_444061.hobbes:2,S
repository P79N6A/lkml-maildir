I realised that this only reduces the time running with interrupts
disabled but won't solve the soft lockup.

Couldn't get it on my (embedded) platform but I think that's because
there are only a few reports in the memleak file. You have thousands
of reports and I think reading the memleak file is causing the soft
lockup.
Until we identify the leak (or false positive), you can use the
attached patch to supress the reports for context_struct_to_string.
Hopefully, this should eliminate the soft lockup as well.

Ignore the (real) leak report in context_struct_to_string
From: Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com>
This might be a real leak but, because of the amount of information
kmemleak reports, we ignore it for now to allow testing of other parts of
kmemleak.
