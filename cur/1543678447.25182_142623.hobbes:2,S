Wait a minute... A word processor that waits 24 hours to recieve an input is
IDLE for everything except file save/checkpoint.
No CPU utilization at all.
What SHOULD happen gradually is that it's memory (RSS) should be trimmed due
to lack of activity.
The processor priority should/could stay the same (or even go higher). That
way the applications gets a chance to page in necessary data AS SOON as the
input IS available.
The described word processor is a MEMORY scheduling issue, not an interactive
scheduling issue.
Interactive jobs can be identified by having short term sleep events occuring
before (more often than) timeslice consumption. These processes could use a
priority boost (special conditions do occurr with polling without a timeout).
Those processes that exhaust a timeslice frequently are CPU bound, with 
little I/O involved. These could do with a reduced priority (again, some
special conditions do occur with poll).
