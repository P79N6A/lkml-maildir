Subject: [PATCH] Kconfig.debug: Set DEBUG_MUTEX to off by default

Hi,
DEBUG_MUTEX flag is on by default in current kernel configuration.
During performance testing, we saw mutex debug functions like
mutex_debug_check_no_locks_freed (called by kfree()) is expensive as it
goes through a global list of memory areas with mutex lock and do the
checking.  For benchmarks such as Volanomark and Hackbench, we have seen
more than 40% drop in performance on some platforms.  We suggest to set
DEBUG_MUTEX off by default.  Or at least do that later when we feel that
the mutex changes in the current code have stabilized.
