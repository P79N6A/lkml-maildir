Likely easiest to do it from userspace by writing into /proc/mtrr to 
change the memory type attributes. Have a look at Documentation/mtrr.txt.

That caching attribute affects reads as well. If it's marked uncacheable 
or write-combining then reads will never be cached, only if it's marked 
write-back.

No, that's not meant to handle this case of stale data in the CPU's 
cache since that doesn't normally happen. Something like clflush or 
wbinvd would do it, those being x86 specific of course..

Setting write-combining should be fairly easy without too many wierd 
side effects. Trying to use write-back to get burst reads is potentially 
doable, but may be fraught with difficulty.
I think DMA in both directions is still likely better though, unless the 
data you are writing is very small. Most chipsets have pretty small 
posting buffers so the amount it will help you is small. If you fill 
them up you'll just stall the CPU. With doing a DMA read, at least only 
the device will stall.
