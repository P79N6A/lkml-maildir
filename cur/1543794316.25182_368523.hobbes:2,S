sound/isa/Kconfig:
253 config SND_SB16
254         tristate "Sound Blaster 16 (PnP)"
255         depends on SND
256         select SND_OPL3_LIB
257         select SND_MPU401_UART
258         select SND_PCM
259         select SND_GENERIC_DRIVER
260         help
261           Say Y here to include support for Sound Blaster 16 soundcards
262           (including the Plug and Play version).
263 
264           To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
265           will be called snd-sb16.
