Thank you for pointing out the issue.
In my understanding, copy_page_range() is used at fork().
This finally calls copy_one_pte() and copies ptes one by one.
Maybe, I'll do like this.

 439                 if (!pte_file(pte)) {
 440                         swap_duplicate(pte_to_swp_entry(pte));
 			     entry = pte_to_swp_entry(pte);
#ifdef CONFIG_MIGRATION
			     if (is_migration_entry(entry)) {
				......always copy as MIGRATION_READ.
			     }
#endif
 441                         /* make sure dst_mm is on swapoff's mmlist. */
 442                         if (unlikely(list_empty(&dst_mm->mmlist))) {
 443                                 spin_lock(&mmlist_lock);
 444                                 if (list_empty(&dst_mm->mmlist))
 445                                         list_add(&dst_mm->mmlist,
 446                                                  &src_mm->mmlist);
 447                                 spin_unlock(&mmlist_lock);
 448                         }
 449                 }
 450                 goto out_set_pte;
 451         }
