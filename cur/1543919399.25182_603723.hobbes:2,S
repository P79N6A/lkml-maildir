I don't understand why do_coredump() clears DUMPABLE too.

Do we really need the new MMF_DUMP_STARTED flag? We are holding ->mmap_sem,
can't we check "mm->core_waiters != 0" instead?
Hmm. Actually, do we need any check? If another thread (or CLONE_VM task)
already started do_coredump(), we must see SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT when we take
->mmap_sem. In that case coredump_wait() does nothing but returns -EAGAIN.

Looks like this change is all we need, no? The only problem is that we
return -EAGAIN if we race with another thread (the current code returns 0),
but nobody checks the returned value.
What do you think?
Oleg.
