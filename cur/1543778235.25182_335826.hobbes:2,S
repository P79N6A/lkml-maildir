Nacked.
I'd like John (or someone) to look at this.  I'm particularly worred
about:
1. passing NULL into (read|write)_scoop_reg() - which use dev_get_drvdata()
   on this.  Given the choice between creating code which will definitely
   oops but not error or warn vs not compiling, I'll take not compiling
   any day.
2. whether this is supposed to be using the sharp chip driver rather
   than the cfi stuff.
