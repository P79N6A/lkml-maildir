Think what happens if you have all these pages in page cache.  Already.
Returning -EIO is hardly a good idea in that case.  Look through the
loop - we assign err in the body only if we have to allocate a new
page.
Notice that any bh brings the page in.  I.e. for smaller-than-page ones
you are going to have a lot of fun...

Sure, one of these assignments had to go away.  You'd picked the wrong one,
though...
