kernel/module.c bumps the use count at the start of each query, to
prevent the module being removed while it is being queried.  The use
count is droped at the end of normal query processing, but
kernel/module.c is breaking and leaving the raised use count.

Information about the second module in the chain (after "serial") is
corrupt.  What does lsmod report?
You should have several oops reports in your syslog.  Run the first two
through ksymoops and send in the ksymoops output.
