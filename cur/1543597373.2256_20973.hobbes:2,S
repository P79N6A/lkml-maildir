I have NO idea and feel the same way. Some of the clients might be buried in
some net inside India or China or the US some other place with some goofy
internal net .. I dunno.  All I know is that MicroSquish set their default
TTL to 128 and there APPEAR to be people reaching me that are more than 64
hops away that are in fact reachable when I increase the TTL.
