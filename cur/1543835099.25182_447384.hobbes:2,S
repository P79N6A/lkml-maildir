Subject: [PATCH 24/30] FS-Cache: Release page->private in failed readahead [try #11]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/27/336

The attached patch causes read_cache_pages() to release page-private data on a
page for which add_to_page_cache() fails or the filler function fails. This
permits pages with caching references associated with them to be cleaned up.
Further changes [try #9] that have been made:
 (*) The try_to_release_page() is called instead of calling the releasepage()
     op directly.
 (*) The page is locked before try_to_release_page() is called.
 (*) The call to try_to_release_page() and page_cache_release() have been
     abstracted out into a helper function as this bit of code occurs twice..
Further changes [try #10] that have been made:
 (*) The comment header on the helper function is much expanded.  This states
     why there's a need to call the releasepage() op in the event of an error.
 (*) BUG() if the page is already locked when we try and lock it.
 (*) Don't set the page mapping pointer until we've locked the page.
 (*) The page is unlocked after try_to_release_page() is called.
