Your patches are coming through wordwrapped.  Please fix your email client
in future.
Please also prepare patches in `patch -p1' form. 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
 may prove useful.
This patch potentially spins for four milliseconds with interrupts off,
which will be unpopular.  Is there no alternative?
Anyway, I queued the patch in my kernel so the issue won't be forgotten
about.  I also queued a patch which makes your patch comply with kernel
coding style - it wasn't very close at all.
Thanks.
