I would be _very_ interested in details.  A word of warning, though -
/proc/mounts is b0rken.  If its output grows beyond 4Kb (no matter what
had caused that - lots of NFS mounts, many bindings, etc.) it silently
truncates the output.  Result: deeply confused umount -a.
I'll post the fix as soon as I finish it.  For now too many mountpoints
of any description == confused df and umount -a.
