Note however that this can only occur prior to initial policy load
by /sbin/init; after that, we don't follow that branch.

No, it doesn't affect the access control enforcement.  The caller just
can't get the context string in that case, so in the case of the AVC or
audit, it falls back to only logging the SID for later analysis.  The
audit people are interested in having a way to dump the kernel's SID
table in that case, so we may end up exporting that via selinuxfs.  In
some other cases where we are returning the context to userspace, the
program would get the ENOMEM error ultimately and have to retry when
memory was available.
