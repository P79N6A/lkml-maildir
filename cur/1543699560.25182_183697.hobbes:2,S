Yeah.

The latter.

No, LRU ordering is preserved.  The inactive clean list is just the
last stage before the page really gets freed.

The data that's still in the page could be referenced again, in which
case the page gets moved to the inactive dirty list and from there on
to the active list.
In effect, the inactive clean list is a "soft free" list, which means
we can keep a larger number of pages almost-free, without wasting
memory.
