  Thanks for info. This looks pretty similar to what I have (only that
I have Athlon).

  Umm, I've checked and found nothing obvious. We already have to use
double-indirect block at 16MB, maybe reservation code does some
distiction. Could you mount the filesystem with -o 'noreservation' and
see whether you can still reproduce the problem? Also it may be useful
to find out, whether you see the failure also with some older kernels...
