I'm having problem with retrieving av big avi from my camera. I get a timeout. The avi is just above 10MB which
is about as large as it can be. Retrieving the thumbinail works fine. This is what comes in the log with USB_DEBUG set.
The camera uses PTP for picture transfer, not USB Mass Storage. I have not had any problems with this camera before,
but I have not had larger files that ~5MB either. The same problem occurs with any kernel (2.4 mandrake, 2.6 vanilla 
or 2.6 mandrake). 
Can I change the timeout somehow? There are lots of modules and I'm not sure which one is responsible for what.

(The occasional swedish i18in is I believe close enough to the english original to be understood, but I don't like editing logs).
