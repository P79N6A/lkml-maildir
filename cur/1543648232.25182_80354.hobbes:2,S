All I can suggest is a binary search among the patches that comprise
the difference between pre9 and pre10 to see when the problem comes
in.
There are about 40 patches, so about 6 test runs  should find the

I tried to extract them from bk and have put the 40 patches at:
  
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/pre10/
There is a p-all.tgz  that contains them all.
