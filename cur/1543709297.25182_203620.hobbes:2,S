| ASUS A7V8X mobo, in case it matters:
| 00:10.0 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6202 [USB 2.0 controller] (rev 80)
| 00:10.1 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6202 [USB 2.0 controller] (rev 80)
| 00:10.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6202 [USB 2.0 controller] (rev 80)
| 00:10.3 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. USB 2.0 (rev 82)
| 
| Things that make no difference to this problem:  ACPI, PnP, udev versus devfs.

Is VIA (still) UHCI for USB 1.1?
Maybe it's a VIA UHCI controller problem.
I suggest taking it up on <linux-usb-devel@lists.sf.net>.
