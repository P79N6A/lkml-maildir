My comment from last time about the missing safety net still applies 100%.
Kernel code is getting more complex all the time and running with
very tight stack is just risky.

Who is we? And why? 
About the only half way credible arguments I've seen for it were:  
- "it might reduce stalls in the VM with order 1". Didn't quite
convince me because there were no numbers presented and at least on
x86-64 I've never noticed or got reported significant stalls because
of this.
- "it allows more threads for 32bit which might run out of lowmem" - i
think everybody agrees that the 10k threads case is not really
something to encourage. And even when you want to add it then only a factor
two increase (which this patch brings) is not really too helpful.
The main argument thrown around seems to be "but it will break
binary only modules" - while I'm not fully unsympathetic I don't
think technical issues in the kernel should be guided by 
such political considerations.
I suspect you will be reposting it so often till the voices
of reasons get tired?
