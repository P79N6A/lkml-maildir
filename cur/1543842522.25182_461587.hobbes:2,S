Both Red Hat-based distros and openSuSE-based distros do something
like this with configuration files automatically.  Red Hat's
anaconda/kudzu puts the HWADDR lines in the generated
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* files.  openSuSE's udev rules
puts lines in /etc/udev/rules.d/30-net_persistent_names.rules the
first time it discovers a new interface.  Both methods are intended to
maintain a persistent name for each NIC, after being set up the first
time.  Neither deals well with replacing one NIC with another - you
must edit the config files.
This works pretty well post-install.  It doesn't work well at install
time, all the installers use the kernel's original names, and then
those names become the persistent names in the config files.

If they're using config files / udev rules as suggested, it shouldn't
break them.
If they're not, then yes, this could.  Debian's
/etc/network/interfaces file allows use of hwaddr fields, though by
default it doesn't appear anything sets it up.
I'm open to suggestions on how *not* to break setups that don't use
the MAC addresses.
Thanks,
Matt
