 I don't think it's dangerous on sane systems -- the 8259A is such an old
and simple chip there is no excuse for not getting appropriate knowledge
on it before working on it both from the hardware and the software's
points of view.  There is no need to waste cycles, of course.

 Well, experience shows BIOSes tend to be nasty -- I don't think yours is
particular here, although bugs may differ.
