make oldconfig
make -j2 install
(Also tried 'make -j2 bzImage' with no change in behavior observed.)
I always do this directly from the command line, no special scripts.

Attached since I'm sure this mail client will wrap it horribly otherwise. I
enabled verbose mode for the capture since I figured you probably wanted all
the details you could get. This particular compile is for -test6, the first
non-working version.
An additional item I just noticed...I do see 2 parallel builds for the very
first part of the  session (when various items in the scripts/ directory are
being compiled).  As soon as the scripts/ directory is finished, I only see
one process and my idle cpu usage jumps to about 40% (from 0%).
I'm happy to try anything else you wish...
