Here's another (conflicting) patch by the same author:
http://bugme.osdl.org/attachment.cgi?id=684&action=view
There's an oops I'm having (bugzilla bug 976 -- basically, after
modprobing pcnet32 on a box without pcnet32 hardware, the next ethernet
driver to be modprobed blows up) which is not fixed by the patch in
test4-mm1, but which is fixed by attachment 684...
