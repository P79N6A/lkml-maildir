SELinux already provides a way to protect /etc/shadow, in a much
stronger way.  It does require some library/application modifications
(already present in some distros) to preserve a different security label
on files containing shadow data than on files containing public passwd
data, but that is no different than the existing approach for preserving
different file modes on those files.  It doesn't require the kernel to
deal with pathnames itself.
