Huh? Sounds like something is seriously screwed up in your kernel
build then. CONFIG_NFS_DIRECTIO should should result in 2 things only:
  - direct.c gets compiled.
  - the 'direct_IO' address space operation gets defined, so that the
    VFS knows what to do with files that get opened with the O_DIRECT
    flag.
None of the ordinary NFS read and write code paths should be affected
by the above.
Cheers,
