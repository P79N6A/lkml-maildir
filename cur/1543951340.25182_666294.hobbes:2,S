So Kenji is arguing that _STA should be called before _SUN (iow that the _SUN 
value is bogus unless _STA indicates that the slot is powered)?  That seems 
harder for the user; often times you want to find a slot even if it's powered 
down & empty (say to add a new card)...  It looks like the current code won't 
provide a slot name on Fujitsu machines in this case, or am I missing 
something?
Thanks,
