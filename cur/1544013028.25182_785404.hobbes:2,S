Subject: [PATCH 2/5] regulator: Clean up kerneldoc warnings
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/31/108

Remove kerneldoc warnings that don't relate to missing documentation,
mostly by renaming parameters in the documentation to match their
actual names.
Signed-off-by: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>
