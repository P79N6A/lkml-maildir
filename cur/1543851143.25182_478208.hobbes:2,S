Hi,
If you don't enable lapic, you will see cat /proc/interrupts with
XT-PIC.
if you try enable lapic, somehow IRQ routing should change 
and if /proc/interrupts still the same, with IRQs on XT-PIC.
I think, lapic still not enable and you just get problems.
Unless you know that lapic works, you should try it enable because it a
trap that just give you a problem. 
Some years ago (2002/3) was a very common bug kernel try enable
automatically lapic (when BIOS don't) and computer hangs .
