Andrew,
This patch is dependent on the rcu_barrier patch buried in reiser4
patchset. It makes sense to merge that patch without waiting
for reiser4 since rcutorture is already in mainline. 
I will send an updated documentation patch describing why 
and how modules using RCU should use rcu_barrier().
Thanks
Dipankar
