Done.  What about ASFLAGS and LDFLAGS?

That makes sense if I'm not calculating UNIT or PROCESSOR anyway.  However,
see below.

No.  I think all the arch headers should really appear to be #included under
asm/.  That means that the structure would have to be:
	include/asm-mn10300/asb2303/asm/proc/*.h
That then puts all these header files several levels further down, which isn't
that good.

That's the only plus, but it's a smaller plus than not interpolating several
levels of almost empty directory into the paths for the proc- and unit-specific
headers.

I could.  Or I could do what everyone else does.
Actually, what you perhaps ought to do for a start is to move the individual
include/asm-$ARCH dirs to arch/$ARCH/asm and then you can avoid that symlink
too.

Done.

I don't see why it needs modification.  $(KBUILD_IMAGE) == $(boot)/zImage for
the zImage target.

Done.

Done.

The copyright assignment on some of these files was made by MEI.  I'm not sure
I can change them.

Yes.  Done.

Apparently not.  Consider it gone.

Done.

I don't remember why.  It doesn't seem to be necessary now, however, so it's
now gone.

Gone.

Gone.
