Yes. I know this. But
static inline void get_page(struct page *page)
                                                     ~~~~~~ changed by
this function.
{
         page = compound_head(page);
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         VM_BUG_ON(atomic_read(&page->_count) == 0);
         atomic_inc(&page->_count);
}
As I understand, just need update the first page reference count.
Or the caller aware of this bahavior?
Or change it to
static inline void get_page(struct page *page)
{
         struct page *head_page = compound_head(page);
         VM_BUG_ON(atomic_read(&head_page->_count) == 0);
         atomic_inc(&head_page->_count);
}
