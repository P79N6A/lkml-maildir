That's hardly a problem...
	#define MAX_SLOTS	8
	char * pci_slot_fmt(struct pci_dev *dev)
	{
		static char fmt[MAX_SLOTS][12], p = 0;
		++p %= MAX_SLOTS;
		sprintf( fmt[p], "%d:%d:%d",
			 BUS(dev), SLOT(dev), FN(dev) );
		return fmt[p];
	}
How many slots do you wish to allow for?
Best wishes from Riley.
