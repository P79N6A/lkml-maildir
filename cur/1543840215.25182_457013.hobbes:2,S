OK.  That version does not take tasks' nice values into account when 
doing load balancing and just tries to evenly distribute the tasks among 
the CPUs.  The smpnice patches (to be included in the 2.6.18 kernel) 
change this so that nice is taken into account when load balancing is 
done and should fix your problem.
