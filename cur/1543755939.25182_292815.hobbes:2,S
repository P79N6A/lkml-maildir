Subject: [PATCH 0/3] refactor i386 memory setup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following 3 patches help to make some of the i386 NUMA code a bit
more manageable, and remove a lot of duplicate code in the process.  All
3 together were test-booted on a NUMA-Q, Summit, and a regular old
laptop.
They're in no hurry to get merged, and could wait for the 2.6.12 series.
