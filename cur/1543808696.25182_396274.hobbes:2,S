Come on, kernel does not need that info at all. In fact, cdrecord
doesn't need it either. Some frontends, maybe, though hal may be
better source if running.
In fact udev isn't mandatory either. We have it because it's handy,
it saves us from megatons of /dev files and keeps /dev/black-dvd in
sync with black dvd.
Personally I think the whole "cdrecord -scanbus" is bogus - command
line utils should do what they are asked to do (e.g., write to
/dev/hda1 or /dev/microcode if so requested).
