I can contribute a little info. If SLUB debugging is enabled, and the boot
command includes 'slub_debug=P', I get a GPF in kref_get(), which is called from
kobject_get() with the following code:
        if (kobj)
                kref_get(&kobj->kref);
From the dump, &kobj->kref is 0x6b6b6b6b6b6b6dbb, a poisoned value.
Somewhere, the "struct urb" has been freed, but kobj has not been set to NULL.
As everything I've found is a symptom, I'm still looking for the real cause.
