I realise now that I missed mentioning my point. What I envision as a
stable binary interface for comunication between the kernel and the
hypervisor is exactly the current situation that goes into the
hypervisor when the kernel does any priviledged instruction. I
understand that paravirtualization gives a very good speed boost
(within 5% of native speed IIRC?), but I was also wondering about the
relative speed of running unmodified kernels.

Yes, I agree that doing it at the subarch level is good, so that
native subarch gets the original code and the hypervisored subarch
gets the modified one without messing with core kernel code.

I've been fishing in my mail archive and was unable to get any
discussion about abstract mmu... do you know where I can get more info
on that?

Here I'd like to say that I mentioned both mol and the sun T1 because
so far we haven't had any discussion on whether any of their
interfaces are worth copying for the x86 case. Also worth looking at
would be the work done by IBM for ppc64 and s390, especially the last
one is prone to be very optimised since their hypervisor work has been
proven to work for a very long time.
I sure don't mean to diss out both vmware and xen work on the field,
given the rocky nature of the x86 architecture, but maybe taking a
look at preexisting work can be a good idea if it hasn't been done
earlier.
