poll() tells you something happened, ioctl() tells you what. Poll
has some bits (POLLIN, POLLOUT, etc.) that can be used to tell
the user-mode task what information to actually request in the
ioctl() call. Your ioctl() can receive and send anything if you
use the third variable as a pointer to your stuff.
	struct info {
		int a;
		int b;
		...
		...
		} info;
        int fd;
        struct pollfd pfd;
        fd = open("/dev/device", O_RDWR);
        pfd.fd = fd;
        pfd.events = POLLIN;
        pfd.revents = 0;
        if(poll(&pfd, 1, 0) <= 0)
            handle_problem();
        else if (pfd.revents & POLLIN)
            ret = ioctl(fd, GET_MY_INFORMATION, &foo);
        else if (pfd.revents & POLLOUT)
            ret = ioctl(fd, CHANGE_CONFIGURATION, &how);
