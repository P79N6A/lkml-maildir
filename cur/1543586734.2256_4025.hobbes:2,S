Actually, it's not just OLTP, anytime you are doing time sharing between 
hundreds of users (something POSIX systems are supposed to be good at) this 
will happen.

Actually, one way to semi-support this approach is to implement 
many-to-many threads as per the Solaris approach. This also requires 
significant hacking of both the kernel and the runtime, and certainly is 
significantly more error prone than trying to write a flexible scheduler.
One problem you didn't highlight that even the above case does not happily 
identify is that for security reasons you may very well need each user's 
requests to take place in a different process. If you don't, then you have 
to implement a very well tested and secure user-level security mechanism to 
ensure things like privacy (above and beyond the time-sharing).
The world is filled with a wide variety of types of applications, and 
unless you know two programming approaches are functionaly equivalent (and 
event driven/polling I/O vs. tons of running processes are NOT), you 
shouldn't say one approach is "broken". You could say it's a "broken" 
approach to building web servers. Unfortunately, things like kernels and 
standard libraries should work well in the general case.
