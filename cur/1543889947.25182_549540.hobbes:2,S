If you stop repeating that you are not responsible for that buggy stuff then I 
will be friendlier. That's all.
So calm down and provide me some parametres to debug.
I will be cooperative and we're gonna fix it for sure, OK?

First of all, I need debugging parametres for both modules (b44 and ssb).
Second, I need to know which log you need after using those debug parametres.
This is the only chance to move forward, isn't it?

Yes. But the features / extensions / different cases of b44 usage need to be 
explained in some small Kconfig text, making it easy for users to put the 
right selection for their specific NIC controller. But exactly this Kconfig 
leaves you in the dark. That's it what I critizise, nothing else. Just try to 
see through my eyes: Who would be happy with guessing around? Noone.
Cheers
