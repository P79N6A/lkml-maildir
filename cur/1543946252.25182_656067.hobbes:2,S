OT: what benchmarks did you use for that? I had a change some time
ago to the CFS scheduler to avoid unpredicted indirect calls for
the common case, but I wasn't able to benchmark a difference with the usual 
suspect benchmark (lmbench). Since it increased code size by
a few bytes it was rejected then.

Hmm, the P4 the trace cache actually should not care about inline
code that is not executed.

I think it depends on the generation. Prescott class branch
prediction should be much better than the earlier ones.

That's -Os.

It depends on the CPU. e.g. on K8 and P6 using CMOV if possible
makes sense. P4 doesn't like it though.

But only when the explicit hints are different from what the implicit
branch predictors would predict anyways. And if you look at the
heuristics that is not often the case...
Also I really think that mm patch that measured unlikely efficiency
should be dug out and merged to mainline and them regularly rechecked.
