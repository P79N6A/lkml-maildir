I don't think that the kernel take care about the nameservers during bootup.
On my debian system resolving is only working, after init takes control
over the system and the network scripts running the dhclient-script
which also sends an dhcp-request - and finally get the same ip - and
adds the nameservers into the resolv.conf.
