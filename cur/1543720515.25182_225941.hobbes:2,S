This patch creates and exports 2 functions which can be used
by the rest of kernel code to perform DMI data checks:
 - dmi_check_system() function checks system DMI data against
given blacklist table and on each match runs corresponding
callback function;
 - dmi_get_system_info() function returns DMI data value.
Useful for people wanting more complex DMI data check than
simple string match.
Also filling unused match entries with NO_MATCH made optional,
but existing NO_MATCH occurences are left intact, so people
are free to continue dmi_scan.c patching without massive
reject problems.
Best regards.
