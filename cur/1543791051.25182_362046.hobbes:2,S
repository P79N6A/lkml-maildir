Right.

It hinges all on how long the high order kernel allocation is. If it's
short-lived, it will get freed back to the easyrclm free lists and we
don't fragment. If it turns out to be long lived, then we are in trouble.
If this turns out to be the case, a possibility would be to use the
__GFP_KERNRCLM flag for high order, short lived allocations. This would
tend to group large free areas in the same place. It would only be worth
investigating if we found that memory still got fragmented over very long
periods of time.

No arguement with you there. My actual aim is to guarantee HugeTLB
allocations for userspace which we currently have to reserve at boot time.
Stuff like memory hotplug remove and high order kernel allocations are
benefits that would be nice to pick up on the way.
