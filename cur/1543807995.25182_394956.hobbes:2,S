Hmm, this (and further up) could fail, yet you don't check.
I don't think this API is very nice to be honest, there's no good way to
handle failures - you can't just sleep and loop retry the execute if you
are in_interrupt(). I'd prefer passing in a work_queue_work (with a
better name :-) that has been allocated at a reliable time during
initialization.
