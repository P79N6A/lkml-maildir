You call that a fix?  ;-)  I call that working around a bug.
If tasks run slower on cpuX than cpuY because of a heavier int load,
that's the fault of the scheduler not the irqbalancer, be it in-kernel
or userspace.  If there's a lesser-utilized cpu the task needs to be
migrated to that cpu from the irq-loaded one, when CPU accounting
notices the kernel interrupt handling having an impact.
