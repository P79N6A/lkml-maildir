I see, you're going for a much deeper patch. No objections whatsoever,
that's certainly a better solution, but I can't start testing it now (my
IA-64 machine has enough other problems to solve yet).
My patch was merely intended to correct the index for disks on the 1st
IDE controller, which is just plain wrong.
I (being new to kernel hacking) have yet to understand what needs
to happen for patches to enter the main branches.
Cheers,
Martin
