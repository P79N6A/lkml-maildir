Well, my point was exactly that App Armor doesn't (as far as I know) do
anything to enforce the argv[0] convention, nor would it in general
prevent a confined program from making a symlink or hard link.  Even
disregarding that, it seems very fragile in general to make an suid
program (there would be no point in confining the execution of a
non-suid program) perform essentially access control based on argv[0].
