Yes, we need to consolidate that with the CROSS32_COMPILE stuff using by
the boot wrapper (arch/ppc64/boot). I haven't yet completely decided
what to do there, I'll probably assume a biarch compiler by default
instead of using the local gcc for 32 bits unless CROSS32_COMPILE is
specified.

Hrm... I remember back then flip/flop'ing between using .S and .o in the
file list and I had a reason to stick to .S but I can't remember why
now :) It may be something I fixed in the meantime tho, I'll have a
look .
I'm not sure about the "late evaluation" thing, I'm no make expert (just
learning as I write those makefiles), I'll have to dig in the doc here.
