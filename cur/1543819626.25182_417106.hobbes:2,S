While that is true of the voluntary model of acquiring and dropping
privs, it is not true of AppArmor containment, which will just not give
you the priv if it is not in your policy.

That is true: both SELinux and AppArmor use a white list within a single
application policy (for the Targeted Policy) leading to this problem.
White lists have the property of being highly secure, but a big pain in
the ass because they *must* be complete, and you shoot yourself in the
foot if they are not. Black lists are the exact dual; relatively
insecure, and relatively easy to use.
AppArmor uses a hybrid white list/black list approach:
    * Per profile, it is white list: when we confine a program, we
      specify every file and POSIX.1e Capability that it can access.
      This includes an inheritance model, so that all of the children
      that it forks are also confined by policy; what they can exec() is
      controlled.
    * System-wide it is black-list: only programs with an explicit
      policy are confined. However, because of the inheritance model,
      confined programs cannot escape by just exec()'ing some program
      that is not normally confined: AppArmor controls what you can
      exec, and thus controls what other policies you can transition to.
AppArmor also aggressively uses wildcards in policy generation, so you
can e.g. grant "/etc/apache2/** r" and "/srv/www/htdocs/** r" to Apache,
and then not have to care whether you fully exercised all of Apache's
configurations and hit all of the web pages.
