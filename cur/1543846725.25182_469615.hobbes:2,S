Which completely ignored the fact that NFS systems are already having to
truncate 64-bit inode numbers to 32-bits and pass these truncated values
up to userspace. Collisions have been observed in the wild, and I've
already had to change the 64-bit->32-bit hashing algorithm on at least
one occasion.
By moving that truncation into userspace, we will at least give 64-bit
standards-compliant programs a chance to work correctly.
