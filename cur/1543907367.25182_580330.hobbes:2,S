I'm not arguing that the bug fix piece wasn't too big (although
realistically, line counts are only a guide not a rule.  If we discover
something like a calling convention bug in SCSI [reversed kmalloc
arguments, say], I could see a huge patch to fix all of the call
sites) ... I've said I'll take responsibility for that and fix it.
I'm arguing that a too strict an interpretation of bugfix only post -rc1
will damage feature stabilisation.  Please think carefully about this.
If we go out in a released kernel with a problematic user space ABI, we
end up being committed to it forever.
