Maybe on the fourth or fifth time it'll occur you to put it into the
changelog.

None of that appears to be relevant.
A blockdev is just a big, fixed-sized file.  Why cannot it be backed by a
big, fixed-sized file?

OK, it's doing submit_bio() directly.

I'd have thought that a decent intermediate step would be
cache-on-single-file using a_ops.direct_IO, as you're implying above.  Then
all the direct-to-blockdev code can go away.  It'll take some tweaking of
the core direct-io code, but nothing terribly serious.

fs-cache won't do anything without a backing store such as cachefs will it?
Those names are rather confusing, btw.
