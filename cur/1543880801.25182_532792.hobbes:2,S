How is this restrictive? This opens up much goodness to filesystems.
I *want* to be able to use different radix tree index orders for
different inodes in a single filesystem. Not just for data, either;
XFS has metadata constructs larger than a page that mean we have to
carry our own buffer cache around.  Being able to use the page cache
directly for these metadata constructs would enable us to remove a
good chunk of code from XFS....
Cheers,
Dave.
