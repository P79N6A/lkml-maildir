I thought I wrote the same (sorry for my English)...

I think this flag, if at all, probably should be cleared only
consciously by the owner of a work, maybe as a schedule_xxx_work
parameter, (but shouldn't be used from work handlers for rearming).
Mostly it should mean: we are closing (and have no time to chase
our work)...

Checking a flag isn't nasty - it's clear. IMHO current way of checking,
whether cancel succeeded, is nasty.

If there were no place, it would be better, then current way.
But WORK_STRUCT_PENDING couldn't be used for some error checking,
as it's now.

Yes, but currently you cannot to behave like this e.g. with
"rearming" work. And maybe a common api could save some work.
But of course, if you have better way to assure this, it's OK
with me and congratulations!
