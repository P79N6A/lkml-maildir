I faced a similar problem with 2.6.0-test4-mm2 while using unstable kde
3.1.9x(?)
In fact I was not able to do anything and my system became unresponsive,
with kswapd0
hogging 60% CPU. Later X got killed ... I did not face such a situation in
any of the previous
releases (I have been using 2.5 since 2.5.70 )
[ I have 256 MB RAM and 256 SWAP with P4 2.0 GHz]
