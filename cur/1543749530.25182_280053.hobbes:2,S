What I'd like is to _not_ have a standard, so that no one is tempted
to depend on it being there. No one but developers should mount it by
default and no standard tools should depend on it for functionality.
If you put it in a standard place, people will start treating it as
ABI and then a year down the road we will have _three_ /proc-style
ABI barf-bags rather than just one.
