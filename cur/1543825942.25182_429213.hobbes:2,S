But you don't need something as complex as CKRM either.  This capping 
functionality coupled with (the lamented) PAGG patches (should have been 
called TAGG for "task aggregation" instead of PAGG for "process 
aggregation") would allow you to implement a kernel module that could 
apply caps to arbitrary groups of tasks.
