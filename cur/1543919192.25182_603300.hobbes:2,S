Only the pointer can be changed here. AFAIK "a" is a const string.

The "const" here is redundant (just useful for forcing the compiler to
prevent us from shooting our feet). The "b" string is already constant.

This will segfault.

Last line will segfault too.

Please continue below.

Got the point, Thanks!.
