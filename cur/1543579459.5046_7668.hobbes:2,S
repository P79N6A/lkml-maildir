Hi,
I think those drivers have not yet been merged. Since I happend to have
those (and had problem to get them run with the default kernel) I'd like
to asked whether those can be included into the kernel. They are GNU
licensed. Seemingly the SiS updates the existing sis900 driver, the
FA311 is not yet supported by the kernel.
