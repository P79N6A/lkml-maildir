Whoa.  That would be clever of it.
On about half the architectures, BUG is not considered to be no-return.
Dunno if that's a gcc shortcoming or if the architectures just haven't
implemented it properly yet.  This causes those architectures to
generate quite a few warnings in generic code which don't appear on
x86 (this would be one such case if your above theory is correct).
This is fairly irritating of those architectures, as I keep on going
in asking "what's up" and deciding "oh, that again".
