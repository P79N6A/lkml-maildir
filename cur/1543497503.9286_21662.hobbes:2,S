Hi!
To report precisely how much data is/are transferred, my program
needs to know how much data is buffered on tcp socket. Currently I'm
using TIOCOUTQ ioctl, but SNDBUF-OUTQ does not exactly equal to amount
of data buffered.
Is it possible to add an ioctl to get this very information? Is there
such thing in other operating systems?
   Alexander.
