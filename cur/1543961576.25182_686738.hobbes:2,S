Subject: [RFC][PATCH 0/5] do remounts without consulting sb->s_files list
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This series implements the ability to check a superblock
for writers without consulting the sb->s_files list.  This
is on Al and Christoph's wishlist as something that can
happen now that we have r/o bind mounts merged.
Trond, I'm ccing you because there is some minor NFS
touching going on here.
