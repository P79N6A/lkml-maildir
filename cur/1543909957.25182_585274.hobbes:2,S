Depends on how you view things.  If I do it at any other time, I will
clobber the current configuration of the module, i.e. it will be an
"autoconfig now, overriding current state" trigger.  It will also waste a
lot of memory since a big deal of stuff will stop being __init and
__initdata.
Also, it means the configuration the local admin did gets overwritten every
time HAL or something else feels the need to poke thinkpad-acpi (hopefully
once at system startup, but still...).  I consider that completely
unacceptable, because in my experience, every time you give someone such a
knob, it is abused.
And if I make it a only-one-use knob (i.e. start returning -EPERM after it
was used once), it is not much different from a module parameter, is it?
And both KISS and the principle of least suprise tells me that in that case
it better be a module parameter.
