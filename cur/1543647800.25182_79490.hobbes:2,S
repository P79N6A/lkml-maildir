Yes, there are a number of rude hacks down there to handle oopses
and early startup.  It's just a messy problem, and no solution to
it will be a thing of beauty.
And early printk is obviously a useful thing to have when the
machine won't start.
I think what we need James is just the low-level hook in printk.c which
the various platforms and boards can plug into.  The one in Martin's
patch (module some cleanups, docco, conversion to C, etc) looks
suitable to me.  The actual early console drivers don't appear to have
much relationship at all to the console layer really.  They're just
minimal-code busy-wait port banging.
The patch needs to be split.
- Generic part in printk.c. Make sure that it suits all users
- ia32 serial early console driver
- ia32 VGA early console driver.
What else?
And who's going to do it?
