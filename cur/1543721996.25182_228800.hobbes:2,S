I don't know if I did send it elsewhere. Maybe I had
intended to add linux-kernel.

So the content of /proc/*/cmdline is correct?
At a minimum, you will have a problem at startup.
The process might be observed before you fix argv.
What about apps that walk off the end of argv to get
at the environment?
It seems cleaner to use some other mechanism.
Assuming your interpreter is ELF, ELF notes are good.
You might use prctl().
