If a process might be/is needed to get the image to the storage device,
it should be NOFREEZE. (Thus, USB threads might be NOFREEZE to allow for
USB storage, likewise for SCSI). When I get an NFS writer done, the
threads for network cards could probably be made NOFREEZE too. Things
like kjournald don't need to run during suspend (even if we're writing
to a swapfile in an ext3 partition), so can be 0 for now (SYNCTHREAD
later).

I've just started following your mm patches, and will do updates for
last nights release shortly.
