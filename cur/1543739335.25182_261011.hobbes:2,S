Subject: [ANNOUNCE] udev 039 release

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've released the 039 version of udev.  It can be found at:
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-039.tar.gz
udev allows users to have a dynamic /dev and provides the ability to
have persistent device names.  It uses sysfs and /sbin/hotplug and runs
entirely in userspace.  It requires a 2.6 kernel with CONFIG_HOTPLUG
enabled to run.  Please see the udev FAQ for any questions about it:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
For any udev vs devfs questions anyone might have, please see:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs
And there is a general udev web page at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev.html
This release fixes a few major bugs:
	- the config file and manpage are now properly generated
	- wait_for_sysfs is updated for lots of new devices
	- firmware downloading should now work properly, sorry about
	  that, udev shouldn't have stopped that from happening...
	- scsi_id bug fix update.
Thanks to everyone who has send me patches for this release, a full list
of everyone, and their changes is below.
udev development is done in a BitKeeper repository located at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/udev
Daily snapshots of udev from the BitKeeper tree can be found at:

If anyone ever wants a tarball of the current bk tree, just email me.
thanks,
