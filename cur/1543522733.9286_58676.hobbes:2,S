That is pretty much useless as a bug-report.  I could simply state "It does
not do this for me" (which is true).  So what bridge are you using? What
architecture?  Brand and type of the cards?

Did you bother to check www.linux-usb.org? If you had, and had accessed the
searchable email archive, you would have found that on Sat, 21 Aug 1999
Matthew Dharm <mdharm@one-eyed-alien.net> was asking for a contact at
Netgear/Baynetworks because there are no specs for this thing available on
the webpage.  I am afraid "no specs" means "no driver".
