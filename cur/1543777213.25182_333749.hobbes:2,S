Christoph - We have already fixed the problem long ago; e.g.
remember when you asked me to kill the timers from the eh threads.  
Thus in todays drivers you will not find scsi_device_online called anywhere
in 
the fusion drivers.
I only objected to killing the linux_compat.h file because its being used
in our internal supported drivers, and it makes it easier upgrade path
for maintaining mainstream drivers if that was left behind in the kernel
tree.
However everybody has ambushed me on this stance, so go ahead and kill it.
We'll manage fine without it.
