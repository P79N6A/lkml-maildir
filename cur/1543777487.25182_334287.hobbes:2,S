That, of course, you cannot do. But, you can regression test a lot of
other things, and having a default test suite that is constantly being
added to and always being run before releases (that test hardware
agnostic stuff) could help cut down on the number of regressions in
new releases.
You can't test everything this way, nor should you, but you can test
many things, and adding a bit of formal testing to the release
procedure wouldn't be a bad thing IMO.
