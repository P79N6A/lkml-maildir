Before:
messages.1:Jan 24 01:19:45 d2 kernel: [    6.377117] migration_cost=9352
messages.1:Jan 27 21:07:55 d2 kernel: [    6.384871] migration_cost=9329
messages.1:Jan 28 11:00:32 d2 kernel: [    6.384215] migration_cost=9338
messages.1:Jan 28 12:55:03 d2 kernel: [    6.389189] migration_cost=9364
After:
messages:Jan 31 07:55:07 d2 kernel: [    1.859359] migration_cost=9274
This was on a dual PII Xeon with 2MB L2 cache.  About 3.5x as fast and
only 1% change.
Maybe the default could be to run the quick test with an option to run the
more-accurate one?
