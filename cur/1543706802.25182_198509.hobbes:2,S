Thanks for your fast response!

Is anybody using these features? I am thinking about connecting two 120GB 
WD SATA drives (raid) to improve performance and seek times. But I have to 
know if SATA controller works under Linux... (i think it is Silicon Image 
controller or something like that...) Is TCQ supported on these 
controllers? Or it depends on disks being used?

Hope it will work with ALSA...

You mean that kernel 2.6-mm with this patch with APIC and ACPI enabled 
works OK? Is this patch a complete fix or a workaround?
Btw. Is CPU frequency scaling supported on this board (with ACPI)? What 
about other power saving technologies?

Wow! This fringtens me! What do you mean? Why are they so failure-able? 
Are they worse than other new boards in it? Are they, at least, easily, 
fast and free replaced (under warranty)?
Thanks again!
