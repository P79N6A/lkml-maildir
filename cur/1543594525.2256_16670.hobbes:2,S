Hi,
Please help me with the following:
I tried to go through get_current function which is in assembly.
static inline struct task_struct * get_current(void) {
        struct task_struct *current;
        __asm__("andl %%esp,%0; ":"=r" (current) : "0" (~8191UL));
        return current;
 }
Please tell me what is done here. Does current refer to process onproc.
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
sathish
