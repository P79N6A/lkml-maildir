Think about changing perhaps.

If my mailer wraps it wrong I might consider it the fault of my mailer.
It doesn't however, but that's beside the point. Messed up quoting
due to long lines is common and there are no rules that you must use
perfect mailers.

As you said, RFC 1855 is informational and this list has it's own
set of rules. And no, RFC 1855 is not the same as the list rules
as you point out.
Nobody has ever bothered writing an RFC about lkml :)
