My guess would be that the program is issuing some command that craps
out the drive (or controller). It could be a wrong length, or some other
cdb field set incorrectly.
You should try and run blktrace on the device, so we can see which
command is wreaking havoc. In short steps:
- Download 
http://brick.kernel.dk/snaps/blktrace-git-latest.tar.gz,
  untar, make, make install.
- Make sure your config has blktrace support, it's
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IO_TRACE and is in the block layer menu.
Now you are ready to reproduce the problem.
- Run blktrace /dev/sr0 (I'm assuming you only have the one SCSI cd-rom).
- Insert an audio CD.
This should now cause the adaptec drive to go nuts like it usually does.
Once things have settled down and the freeze is over, ctrl-c blktrace.
Then do:
- blkparse sr0 -o sr0.log
and send sr0.log in a reply to this message.
