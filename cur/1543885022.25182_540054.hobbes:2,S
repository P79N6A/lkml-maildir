Your patch is probably ok to add, although I would like to see if any of 
the other Samba team
had thoughts on this, as "null user" sessions are a fairly obscure part 
of the protocol.  But
even with the kernel change, mount.cifs also should change for a loosely 
related case that of
    1) sec=none is not specified by the user
    2) but username also is not specified explicitly
For that case we need to retry on access denied as if it were a request 
for a "null user" mount
ie send sec=none (or equivalently username=) the 2nd time.  This gets 
more complicated
since mount.cifs also has to retry on a couple of other cases (e.g. when 
the server does
not support port 445 but does not take the standard server string 
"*SMBSERVER"
on the RFC1001 called name).
If there are no objections from any of the other Samba guys I will take 
your patch which has
the effect of treating "sec=none" as meaning "ingore any userid if 
specified, and set the username to null
on the session setup").   That is consistent with what we documented.
I had though for a while that a user who mounts passing both "sec=none" 
and a username might
also expect to get a null password (they could have done this with 
"guest" or with "password=") or
might want to try to send the password in plaintext - but I doubt that 
we want to support
a user who wants to send the password plaintext without the server 
requiring it (and in that
case cifs can be built and configured to allow plaintext if absolutely 
necessary to support
those ancient servers).
Basically if we set username to null in kernel when (sec=none)
