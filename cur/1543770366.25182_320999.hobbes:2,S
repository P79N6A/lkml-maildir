First, I just realized the typo in my previous message's subject:
Should read 2.6.*11.*9 smp, instead of 2.6_.9. Sorry :|

I confirm this here too: random place, always a dir, always 'rec_len % 4 
!= 0', no fs issue or data loss (so far...)

By heavy load, I mean a system load between 10 and 15 for 3 hours 
(before error) Processes running were several instances of mkisofs 
(reading from and writing to the faulty partition)

As my kernel is a 2.6.11.9, It is not fixed so far.
I will reformat when possible, this time I will use lvm over raid5, so I 
can use xfs for my usefull data, and keep a medium ext3 partition to 
make tests if needed (just need to know what to test)
Thanks
