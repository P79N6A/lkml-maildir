I haven't seen any other replies, so here goes.
You should have no problem using the 860 chipset AFAIK
[but I don't have such a system :(  ].
There are still some issues with interrupt balancing on SMP
P4 systems.  Last I heard, all interrupts will be routed
to one CPU instead of [mostly] balanced between them
(until this is fixed/patched).
HTH.
