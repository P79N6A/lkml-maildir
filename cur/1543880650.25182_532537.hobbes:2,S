*please* put the branch-name after the git repo, so that I can 
cut-and-paste without noticing only afterwards that the diffstat doesn't 
match what it was supposed to, and I got the wrong commits, and have to 
undo and re-do the pull..
Yeah, I didn't do that mistake this time, and in fact, I seldom do, but 
every time the branch is mentioned somewhere else than with the actual 
repo to pull, I get nervous. 
So I've said this a million times before, but I'll say it one more 
time: if it's not the main branch, the message should be
   Please pull from the 'linus' branch of
     git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/avi/kvm.git linus
   to get the following changes: ...
so that when I cut-and-paste the URL (you didn't think I'd try to type it 
in by hand, did you?) I get the branch automatically.
