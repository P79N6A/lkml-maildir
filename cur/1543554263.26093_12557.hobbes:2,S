Numerically high load averages aren't inherently a bad thing.  There
isn't anything bad about a system with a loadavg of 20 if it does what
it should in the time you'd expect.  However, if your daemons start
blocking because they assume this number means badness, than that is
the problem, not the loadavg in itself.
