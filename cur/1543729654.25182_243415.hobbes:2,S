Which is the same as saying it occurs on the negative-to-non-negative
transition. The "if ((int)low >= 0)" test is just a test and branch
on sign, while your original requires either a (microcoded?) bit op,
or constructing a large-magnitude mask, followed by some tests.
Yes this is a micro-optimisation, but I find it actually simplifies the code.
