Just to let you know, I did cook up a patch but the user has gone 
unresponsive (it's an important production server so finding downtime is 
hard).
Here is the patch if you are interested: 
http://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=82195&action=view
If/when he responds, I'll remove the 2nd hunk and submit the patch properly.
Thanks,
Daniel
