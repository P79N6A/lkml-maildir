Hmmm I really wonder if this makes any sense for the current Intel Motherboard
design. Since the CPUs fight for the PCI bus does it really matter which
one they use?
On the alpha ev6 bus this could really be useful but I think to take
full advantage of the spped you would need two PCI buses.
Also if you bind a cpu card to a CPU what if the cards are on different
nets? How would you bind a software to a specific CPU?
