   In patch-2.4.17-pre2, a nonsensical change was made in 
   linux/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_linux.c .  While apparently 
   harmless, it suggests to me that you had intended to fold in an 
   entirely different patch, and "missed".
   
Missed?  That patch fixes a lethal bug.
   I don't find a current maintainer for aic7xxx listed in MAINTAINERS.
It's listed in the aic7xxx sources, but the fix in question came to
Marcelo via Jens Axboe.
Franks a lot,
