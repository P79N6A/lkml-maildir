Exactly! I'm currently running a highly patched kernel based on 2.6.8-
rc2-bk7 plus Con's work and Ingo's voluntary preempt. They work fine
when suspending to memory (S3) and to disk (S4 via swsusp), but adding
your kthread freezer flags to the mix keeps my CardBus NIC from being
recognized when resuming from S3: I need to unplug it, then plug it to
make it functional again.
However, I'm not sure what causes this behavior.
