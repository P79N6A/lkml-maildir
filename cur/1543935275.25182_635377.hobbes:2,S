Today I upgraded my kernel from 2.6.23.9 to 2.6.23.12 and in the past
30 minutes I have had to restart my computer twice.
I believe its a kernel oops or a kernel panic because when the
computer freezes it blinks the caps and scroll lock LEDs.
I don't know what is causing the problem but I am willing to help, I
can provide you with any information you need.
The only problem is that I don't know how to debug the system myself.
If anyone can tell me what to do to I can do it and give back the
information.
The system I am running is a slackware 12.0 with the new kernel.

Thank you ahead of time for any help.
