Convenience more than anything.
It's to do with how the configs for Fedora/RHEL kernels are generated.
Rather than have a dozen separate .config files, and have to add a new
option to each of them, it's done in a 'templated' manner.
We have for eg, a config-generic, and then various config-$arch files,
which are munged together with a perl script to generate a final .config
that our build system eats for each arch it builds.
Having a list of all the new options together means that I can just cut-n-paste
that block of text into config-generic, and then drop out the ones that
should be per-arch.
I've felt it's another of those 'of little practical use to anyone not building
a Fedora/RHEL kernel' type patches that I've not bothered pushing it upstream.
