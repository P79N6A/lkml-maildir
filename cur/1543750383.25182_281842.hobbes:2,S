 i  am accessing a variable from two modules . in one module iam  reading
the varible , and in another module i am updating the variable for each a
second.
in the second module i am using interruptible_sleep_on_timeout so that it
will
be wake up after one second and update the varible. but the problem i am
facing is i couldn't read the variable in the first module  for the moment
of time when the second module gets sleep. please can any one help me to
