Some time ago, I sent on this list a mail about my strange problem with
my SiS900 network card (Subject was Sluggish performances with FreeBSD)
To sum up, when my card is in 100Mb mode, I have poor throughput but in
10Mb, all seems normal.
After some tests, it seems these results was due to a misdetection of
the PHY device. mii-tool reports :
 product info: vendor 08:00:17, model 3 rev 0
and after some search on the web, I found it's a NS DP83847 which is
very similar
Here is the patch :

Hope it can help some people
