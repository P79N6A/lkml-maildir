Do you assume I speak for the GNU project and for University of
Campinas as well, just because my signature implies that I am somehow
associated with them?

What's odd is your assuming that I'm an FSF board member.  Especially
when there's a URL just next to it that explains what FSFLA is, and
how it's not the FSF, but rather one of four members of the network of
FSFs.

Yeah, it's really hard to clarify broken assumptions and jumping to
conclusions.

Why would this convey the impression that I'm speaking on behalf of
Red Hat, tell me.  It doesn't even say I'm president, CEO, PR manager,
press contact or any such thing...
If I posted from my ISP e-mail address, would you assume I was
speaking for the ISP?
