I agree with Andi here.

Exactly.  On modern machines, doing a procedure call to get the time (as
opposed to a system trap) is, I suspect, very tolerable.  And who knows,
maybe a smart compiler inlines the procedure so it optimizes to just a
few instructions.
If behind the scenes there is a mapped page that is used to convey this
information efficiently, that's fine.  
But I don't think it should be the application programmer's
responsibility to know of hackish solutions of mmapping particular
devices on particular OS hardware or software platforms.  That's a
symptom of the disease, rather than a clean solution.

Turns out we already have code to handle the turn back case, but
monotonically increasing time is generally appreciated ;-).

Yup.  I agree entirely.
