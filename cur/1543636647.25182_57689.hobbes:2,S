I find it odd if it's the driver, to be honest. Cause we've been running
with everything from 4.x-series, 5.x-series and 6.x-series on our current
in-production-system. This also runs linux vanilla, although with qla
driver patched in-kernel. (Currently 2.4.18 running).
So, the only differense between the new and old setup is:
* Dell 2550 in old vs 2650 in new (2xP3 vs 2xP4 Xeon)
* Old servers mount one disk each (and have only one HBA), but
  the new servers are supposed to have two HBAs, and have one
  disk on each HBA.
I don't see any good reason why this should result in no disks found
whatsoever.
