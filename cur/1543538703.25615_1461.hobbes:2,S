Removing the 'successfully mounted' printk is reasonable - although it's 
only on mount and it's within CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL code so I'd hardly class 
it as essential. The other two definitely look like 'something wrong' cases 
to me, though. I'll chat with you later.
There is actually a more serious bug fixed in the JFFS code which has 
already made it into my tree - but I'm waiting for Al Viro to give me his 
verdict and any necessary patches before I offload that onto Linus.
