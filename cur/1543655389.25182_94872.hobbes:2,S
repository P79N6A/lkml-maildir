Hi Everyone,
I ran into a lockup with the O(1) scheduler back in August and
exchanged email with Andrea. I tried a couple of his patches.
They prevented the lockup but it was still easy to have the
X server exiled to the inactive array for seconds at a time.
This got me started working on a patch to make the schedule
more fair.
I posted a patch archive here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103508412423719&w=2
It fixes fairness but breaks nice(2). Rik van Riel has a
patch here which builds on my patch which fixes this:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103651801424031&w=2
I tested the combination of these patches with linux-2.5.48 and
it seems well behaved:-)  
I found this problem with the LTP waitpid06 test.  It actually
produced a live-lock. See this mail:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103133744217082&w=2
I have been distracted by Posix timers but I plan to get back
finish this.
