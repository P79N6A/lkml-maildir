I am working to get Diald up and running and with both 2.2.16 and the 2.4.0 
series kernels I have been getting SIOCSIFMETRIC Operation not supported.  
I've looked through the kernel docs and include files but couldn't find a 
reference to that operation.
Is there another name for that operation or does someone have the fix for 
Diald-0.99.4?
Thanks
Adam
