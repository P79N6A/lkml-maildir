The patch includes code that seems to imply that gcc can not do mpy of (long long) variables.  It 
does just fine with these.  It also adds (long long) types just fine.  The only problem it has is 
with div, for which we have do_div().
I really do not see the relavence of the run time library patches given the above.  The adjust code 
does not seem to use them.  Also, gcc (with the lib code) does all of this stuff.  The only need for 
it would, possibly, be to debug the library code and even then, I suspect you really want to do that 
in user land and then bring the result into the kernel.
Am I missing something?
