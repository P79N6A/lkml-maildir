Its not clear if we have a very generic device breakage.. most devices
on these platforms are going to be more recent, (except maybe some
legacy fd)... 
Maybe we should wait to fix unless we are certain if there are more of them
that breaks in these platforms.
We could choose to use the generic 1-1 for those weird cases, since the 
driver does ensure today that physical mem is low 16M, then we could
just turn on 1-1 domain for such devices without breaking any.
