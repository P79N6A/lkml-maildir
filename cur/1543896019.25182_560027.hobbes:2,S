Wrong again. Apache was not allowed to distribute strong
encryption for e-commerce servers over that time frame.  The
solution we bought was O/S agnostic.
And to quote your next message, you have given all the reasons
why NetBSD has already taken over the world.
By the time of Linux 2.0.x, it could stay up for years at a
time even if it was running on garbage.  There was no alternative
even *close*.
