   The only problem is that it doesn't.  It won't try to free
   pages once you have enough free pages, which means you'll
   just end up in a livelock.
It always calls balance_classzone which always calls try_to_free_pages
which always will try to free SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX pages.
Oh, I see, is it that the old and RMAP VM won't do that? :-)
BTW, in checking this out it seems current->allocation_order is only
set and never checked anywhere.
