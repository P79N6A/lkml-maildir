Except that a /sbin/hotplug er, "solution", would be dynamic.  I had
always assumed in the back of my mind that such a solution would make
devfs go away some day, although I don't think I actually read about
it anywhere.
Actually, here's a question: are /sbin/hotplug upcalls serialized in
some fashion?  I'd hate to online a thousand devices in my disk array
and have the machine forkbomb itself.
