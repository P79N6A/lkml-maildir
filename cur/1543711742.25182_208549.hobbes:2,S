You are using the word "instruction" to mean something different than 
what I am using it to mean. I am using "instruction" to mean "the 
smallest cohesive unit of operation". I do NOT mean "instruction" as 
in "an operation coded by the programmer".
I am talking about the case where an "operation" performed in buggy 
hardware is replaced by an "operation" performed in fixed microcode.
By the way, the recent Intel patent lawsuit had this exact same issue. 
The word "instruction" can refer to *any* cohesive unit that performs 
some logical function.
