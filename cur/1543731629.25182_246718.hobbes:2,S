You are right with that. However it's getting better.
On the other hand Solaris works on a really wide spectrum of x86 servers 
(Dell, HP, IBM). I've installed it on x86 servers from 1-way to 8-way 
Compaqs. I've installed it on several desktop systems too.
But you are right - Linux has more drivers on x86 for some 'exotic' 
hardware and home use. And has much more drivers for PCI RAID cards.

1. Why do you think that DTrace is the onle 'cool' feature in Solaris 10?
    Please stop FUD.
    Frankly, if the only specific technical feature Linux has to brag about
    in Linux 2.6 is KProbes, that's pretty sad.
    :P
2. "most of the bugs I see being fixed in Solaris kernel patches"
     1. there are no patches to Solaris 10 kernel so far, so you can't
        see them
     2. you are probably talking about some patches for Solaris 9 kernel
        coming from project ATLAS (performance improvements on x86 - to be
        as fast or faster then other OSes on the same hardware)
     3. and definitely you overstated saying these are most of the patches
        in fact I would be suprised if there are more then 10-20 such
        patches (and hundreds others). Maybe you see this 'coz you are
        looking for word 'Linux' in patches? :)))
3. "Solaris folks used to flame us for,"
     You know - there're trolls in every community.
And this thread was about DTrace and Linux tracing technologies (and not 
trolls, PDAs, other features)... and I know, Linux can run on PDAs.
Ok, so when it comes to profiling and debugging:
 	1. Solaris has DTrace, ptools ant others
 	2. Linux runs on PDAs
:)))))))
ps. sorry for that... on the other hand a little bit of humour is ok :)
