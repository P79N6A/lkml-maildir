I originally considered something similar, but decided on a more
minimalist approach.  I'd as soon do all of the protocol-specific
processing (i.e. group layer and above) in user space, where debugging is
far easier and impact on memory footprint far less.

Only in the case of the Cadet, the syncronisation and error detection is
done in the hardware, so no "raw" format would be available.  I think
these facilities need to be in the kernel, so as to at least be able to
ensure reliable data reception (e.g. TCP sockets).

Agreed.  This project is next on my list after I get the driver completed. 
What I've got in mind is a system that would spawn a child process to
monitor the RDS datastream and then raise SIGUSR back to the parent when a
group of interest has been received.  The data could then be read over a
pipe.  What group types would be "of interest" (e.g. group 0, group 1,
etc.) would be defined as part of the call to initialize the system, so
the calling application doesn't have to be bothered with handling RDS data
types that it doesn't know/care about.

MBS is a protocol that was a precursor to RDS.  It is used in paging
systems.  RDS was crafted to be able to coexist with it on the same
subcarrier.  Details are in the RDS spec.

Good idea.  Instead of an ioctl though, how about designing the driver so
that the RDS decode does not actually start until the initial read() on
the device?  Accomplishes the same thing without the need for a special
ioctl, as nothing but an RDS-aware application will do a read() on a
/dev/radio device.
