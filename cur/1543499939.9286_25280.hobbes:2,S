You can happily consider the unix syscall to be fd->read(buf, size) if you 
prefer, or fd->call(OP_READ, buf, siz). Its entirely semantics however you
write it. it doesn't matter if its compiled into push and lcall (or int 0x80 in
our case) or into a function call that does the int 0x80. The only time it
becomes interesting is when you have hardware doors between nodes. And then
read is just a libc wrapper anyway so you won't have to hit local kernel space
You are arguing ultimately about
	struct foo *x
	x->op_read(buf, size)
v
	foo[fd]->op_read(buf, size)
and if you look at Mosix that becomes extremely obvious for almost every unix
API.
