Untrue. Proof: My patch makes it operate more smoothly on Linux.

I am absolutely serious about the patch and about my recent findings
after looking at libscg.
I just don't want my name tainted with accidents that happen during

too, hence the GPL.

Well, if you'd listened and attempted to understand our scanning
concerns, you'd probably have had libscg use a unified ATA:/SCSI:
namespace in Linux for 1½ years. OK, spilled milk.
