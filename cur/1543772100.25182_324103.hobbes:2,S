Lukas,
I had to investigate the driver a bit and I am mistaken in saying that the NIC 
driver will support the T110 card. It does not.
The reason for this is that the T110 will use the TCAM even in NIC mode and that 
code is missing from the NIC driver. The TCAM needs to be initialized for using 
TCP traffic in tunneled (non-offload) mode. However, if you just add the 
enumeration for the T110, UDP should work but TCP will not. This would not be 
very useful.
The T210 does not have this issue.
Unfortunately, you will need to use the TOE driver for 2.6.6 kernel.
I apologize for the confusion.
