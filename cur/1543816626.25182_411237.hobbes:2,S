I have a doubt... I am not sure if you can have a full working
solution to make all programs run using the virtual serial ports.
Because, there *might* be some programs which actually use the 'in'
and 'out' instructions of the processor directly from a user space
program. (After calling iopl/ioperm etc to elevate their I/O
privileges to directly use the IO ports) I dont think even a kernel
change can help in that case...
Is my understanding correct or am I missing something?
