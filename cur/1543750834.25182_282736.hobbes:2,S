Actually, if that's all you're trying to do, what about
echo '- - -' > /sys/class/scsi_host/host<n>/scan
That'll trigger a rescan of the entire card and the device will be found
and added?
Then, if you simply publish your LD number as an extra parameter of the
device, you can look through /sys to find it.
