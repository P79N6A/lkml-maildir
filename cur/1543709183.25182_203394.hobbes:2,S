Subject: [PATCH] 2.6 series: fixed strange behaviour of scripts/modpost

Hi,
as I found out this morning, it's impossible to use the build-chain
tool modpost of the 2.6 kernel series from within a directory that
contains the character sequence '.o'. Weird things happen if you
try to do so.
With a directory structure like on my system here, building the
current DVB driver in '/home/daniel/cvs.linuxtv.org/dvb-kernel/build-2.6'
generates a file called '/home/daniel/cvs.linuxtv.mod.c' since modpost
cuts every filename string at the first occurence of '.o'.
Funny enough that obviously nobody ever renamed a kernel tree to
something like 'linux-2.6.2.orig' and tried to remake it afterwards ;)
Here's the patch that fixes it:
