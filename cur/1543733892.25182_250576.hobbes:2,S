lt002.v3k1/lt.10 is particularly interesting:
 00000001 0.000ms (+0.000ms): spin_lock (rtl8139_poll)
 00000001 0.000ms (+0.070ms): spin_lock (<00000000>)
 00000001 0.070ms (+0.070ms): rtl8139_rx (rtl8139_poll)
 00000001 0.140ms (+0.070ms): alloc_skb (rtl8139_rx)
 00000001 0.210ms (+0.070ms): kmem_cache_alloc (alloc_skb)
 00000001 0.280ms (+0.073ms): __kmalloc (alloc_skb)
 00000001 0.354ms (+0.139ms): eth_type_trans (rtl8139_rx)
 00000001 0.493ms (+0.076ms): netif_receive_skb (rtl8139_rx)
 00000002 0.570ms (+0.001ms): packet_rcv_spkt (netif_receive_skb)
this too shows the CPU in 'slow motion' in a codepath that normally
executes 10 times faster than this on a 100 MHz Pentium Classic ...
another interesting thing is that the unit of delay seems to be around
70 usecs. As if under certain circumstances every main memory access
created a 70 usecs hit. (a cachemiss perhaps?) The eth_type_trans entry
perhaps generated 2 main memory accesses (2 cachemisses?) or so.
