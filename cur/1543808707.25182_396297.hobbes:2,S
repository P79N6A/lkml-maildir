  Either, or both, depending on the measurement settings.
  I live in a 64-bit world, so my take on this issue would be to expose
the PC as a uint64_t, always. There is already so much overhead in the
default per-sample header that I wouldn't worry about it.
  Now 64 bit might not always be enough. E.g., on PA-RISC. But _I_ do
not care much about Linux on PA.
