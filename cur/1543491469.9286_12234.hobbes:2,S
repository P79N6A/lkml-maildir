But it still changes every few days/weeks/months.  The support in glibc 2.1 
lags behind the current standard-of-the-week by quite a long way at the 
moment.  Alexey is right, there is currently nothing that you can definitively 
say is "the" IPv6 API.
If you ask on the IPv6 working groups they will tell you that RFC 2133 is 
obsolete and point you at a draft paper instead.
