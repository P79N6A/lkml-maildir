This looks fine to me (if you need my ack).

The sparc handling of anonymous pages is different ... they accitentally
sweep them up in flush_dcache_page().  When I audited the architectures
to try to make fuse work on parisc, parisc and arm were the only ones
that actually needed flush_anon_page().
