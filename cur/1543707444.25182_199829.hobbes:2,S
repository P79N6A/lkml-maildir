I must add my voice here in strong opposition of the removal of
cryptoloop from the 2.6 series of kernels.  This is no longer a
development series kernel, I (and others, I'm sure) have been working on
developing technologies which depend on this functionality and which
would be _very_ annoying to do with DM (liveCD-on-cryptoloop-on-iso).
Please do not drop cryptoloop!
