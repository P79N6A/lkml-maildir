Just to make sure everyone is on the same page, let's explicitly list all
of the mentioned options.  As I see it, the fall into 3 categories:
1) devfs, plus configuration daemon
2) Static assignment, plus daemon if needed
3) Rolling assignment (as I proposed, I don't think this made it to the
    linux-kernel list... if not, I should resend those messages), plus
    daemon
Are there any other proposals on the table that I've missed?

I could always suspend a few hundred accounts and watch what happens.
