who cares?
You're talking about compatibility in the wrong direction. You don't
expect to be able to run a 2.2 kernel on SLES10 either. A distro
expecting the kernel to be at least of the version that comes with it
imo is entirely justified and even required to use new features in an
integrated way without overbloating the distro with never used and
undertested compatibility junk.
Running a NEWER kernel.. that's where people have a point.
Now, arguably some of the enterprise distros are not designed with that
in mind (unlike most community distributions), but it's not entirely
unreasonable to expect to be able to do this at least for a while.
