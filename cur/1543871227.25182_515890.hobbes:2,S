I should have described the problem better.  Assuming Nick's patch
(22c8ca78f20724676b6006232bf06cc3e9299539) makes sense by moving the
SetPageUptodate() from nobh_prepare_write() to nobh_commit_write(), it
follows that nobh_truncate_page(), which doesn't call
nobh_commit_write() needs to call SetPageUpdate().

->prepare_write() guarantees that the parts of the page before offset
(and beyond to) are up-to-date, and nobh_truncate_page() zeros the rest
of the page.

->commit_write() is only called after bringing the page up-to-date.

nobh_prepare_write() needs the filesystem's get_block() function, so
a_ops->prepare_write() will call nobh_prepare_write(...,
fs_specific_get_block)

It would be more consistent to call ->commit_write().  I assume it does
what it does as an optimization.  The fact that it doesn't call
nobh_commit_write() can be blamed for this bug, since it wasn't clear
that a change to nobh_commit_write() had to be mirrored in
nobh_truncate_page().

I've added some comments to the patch below

Before Nick's patch, nobh_prepare_write() incorrectly marked the page
up-to-date.  (It was just a little bit too early.)  His patch moved
SetPageUptodate() to a better place, nobh_commit_write(), but it missed
that nobh_truncate_page() cheats by not calling nobh_commit_write().
fs: nobh_truncate_page() must set page up to date
This fixes a regression caused by 22c8ca78f20724676b6006232bf06cc3e9299539.
nobh_prepare_write() no longer marks the page uptodate, so
nobh_truncate_page() needs to do it.
