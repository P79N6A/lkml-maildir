Good point.  The fact that there are other implementations out there
which are doing this is a convincing argument.  
I am still a bit concerned still that a stupidly written program that
opens /dev/urandom (perhaps unwittingly) and tries to read a few
hundred megabytes will become uninterruptible until the read
completes, but I'm not sure it's worth it to but in some kludge that
says "break if there's a signal and count > 1 megabyte --- otherwise
we'll return soon enough".
