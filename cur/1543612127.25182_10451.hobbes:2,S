Subject: Maximum heap size?

I have been STFW'ing for a few hours now and I keep finding conflicting
reports on what the maximum heap size is with Linux 2.4.  Some places say it
is 1GB, and others say it is unlimited.
Background:  We have a java process that dies if the -mx flag passed to java
is more than 1GB.  Our developers say it is a Linux bug (since we don't
have the same problem on Solaris).  We are using Sun J2SE/JDK 1.3.1.
Any clarification would be appreciated.
Thanks,
