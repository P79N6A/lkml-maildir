OK. Applied Thomas' corrective patch and now a debug-stripped RT-V0.6.5
has been built fine on both of my machines.
But I'm afraid to have bad news.
My (now infamous:) jackd-R + 9*fluidsynth test is being abruptly killed by
jack_watchdog. Annoyingly always. On both of my configurations, laptop
(P4/UP) and desktop (P4/SMT), and in any other circunstance, jackd -R
can't survive for long. It just stalls after a while.
To be sincere, this happened once while testing with RT-V0.6.4, but only
after too many successful test runs.
Take care.
