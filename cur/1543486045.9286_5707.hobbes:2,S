Hi all,
Yet another snapshot of modutils is available:
	<
http://www.pi.se/blox/modutils/>
 for "modutils-snap990216.tar.gz"
This version has modprobe and insmod integrated, at least in "phase one".
I still have to verify that insmod doesn't croak if I let modprobe
call its internal functions directly (iteratively). Until then I let
modprobe call insmod as if it was a separate executable.
TODO:
- Let insmod use the same list of module directories as modprobe does.
- Perhaps a configure option to have modprobe as a separate executable(?).
- Replace all "system()" calls except where they are absolutely needed.
- Make use of the new module system calls within modprobe (and depmod).
- Check if depmod should use the _real_ list of exported module symbols.
- Further cleanups...
I think I will let modutils alone for a day or two, so that I can
look at it with clear eyes again.  At the moment I risk becoming
blind for the obvious...
Comments are welcome!
For now,
Björn Ekwall  <bj0rn@blox.se>
