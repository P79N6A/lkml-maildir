I'm with Al on this. 50 Mb for decompression?
Embedded and small device folks will not love this, I'm sure.
*Maybe* we can use lzma. Seems to use 8Mb on decompression:
  PID   VSZ*VSZRW   RSS (SHR) DIRTY (SHR) STACK COMMAND
30474 10708  8604  8760   392  8360     0     8 lzmacat pld-th-x86_64.tar.lzma
(pld-th-x86_64.tar.lzma is a random 40Mb .lzma file I found on the net)
Sizes in Kb again:
32392 linux-2.6.16.17.tar.7z
33520 linux-2.6.16.17.tar.lzma
P.S. sorting files by extension in tarball generally helps, but in case
of Linux kernel, they are all C code anyway, so no measurable gain there.
