They need fixing not removing. But right at the moment trying to fix drivers
is a fairly painful business since th block and scsi layers are still 
somewhat in flux. Also for some drivers bringing them up to the 2.5 
world is non trivial (eg I2O) and takes time anyway.

Bad.. - because now when you come to check you have them all fixed you'll
miss it out, and bad stuff might occur. You want it to choke unless the
user said "please dont choke on..." just so you can find them.
DaveJ's patch is much nicer
