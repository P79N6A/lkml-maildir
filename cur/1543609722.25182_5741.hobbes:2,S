Hmm... I've been experiencing the very same thing, but with a Digicam that 
reports to the PC as a usb-storage device. Mount just hangs.... I haven't 
had the patience to wait for it to time out (especially if i need my pics 
fast)...
Rebooting/halting usually causes an oops with me (while mount is still 
hanging, that is)
