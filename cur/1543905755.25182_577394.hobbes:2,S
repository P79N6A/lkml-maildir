as i pointed it out to you it does, the function's name changed:
 /*
  * sched_yield() support is very simple - we dequeue and enqueue
  */
 static void yield_task_fair(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p)
 {
         struct cfs_rq *cfs_rq = task_cfs_rq(p);
         u64 now = __rq_clock(rq);
         /*
          * Dequeue and enqueue the task to update its
          * position within the tree:
          */
         dequeue_entity(cfs_rq, &p->se, 0, now);
         enqueue_entity(cfs_rq, &p->se, 0, now);
 }
plus others have tried the SD NOP-yield hack-patch and while it slightly 
improved the SD numbers it did not change the "CFS is smoother" 
experience.
