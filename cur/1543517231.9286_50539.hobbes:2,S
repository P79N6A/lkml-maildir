Hi,
there seems to be another tulip bug. The timer interrupt is handled as
abnormal interrupt. At least for 21041 it seems to be a normal interrupt.
This means that the handling of TimeInt should be moved. As I don't know if
it is not an abnormal interrupt for other chips of the tulip familie, one
should move out of normal and abnormal. And one should explicit enable
NormalInt when setting the timer.
The 21041-manual says in 3-45 that is an normal interrupt, too.
Greetings,
Wolfgang Walter
