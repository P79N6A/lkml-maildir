Daniel I agree that there are some real dangers to using a proprietary
tool, and have seen it severely affect a project.  
The primary problem is that some developers are not able to
participate because they do not have the tool. 
Given that bitkeeper is currently freely available, and that people
can still send raw patches I do not see that people are currently
being excluded on basis of the tool they use.
I can see the potential for this to break down.  However we should
not be crying wolf until this actually does break down.
There is exactly one point where religious attitudes are important.
Because of them some people will not use a non-free tool.  So for a
wide spread project there must be some way for them to participate.
diffs are still being accepted, so these people do have a to
participate.
