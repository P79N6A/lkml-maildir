Who is the press release aimed at?  I certainly don't want
a watered down version with important stuff missing just
so some "suits" can grasp every paragraph.
Keep it reasonably simple, but don't be afraid of having a
few technical paragraphs near the end.  I don't think
the "suits" will drop the entire article because of that, 
they will probably just skip the "technical" paragraphs.
There are quite a few people who quit reading when there's
too many marketing buzzwords too.
