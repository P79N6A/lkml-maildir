Hi,
I got the error __alloc_pages: 4-order allocation failed in a module that uses and frees a lot of pages.
Basically, I am trying implement a page cache for the module. First, I keep allocating pages using page_cache_alloc() until it fails, then I free a whole bunch of pages using freepages((unsigned long)page_address(page))
Would anyone please give me some advice about how to solve this problem?
Thanks a lot.
