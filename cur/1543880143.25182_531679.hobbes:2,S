        Just to compare, diffstats for GPIODEV:
Core API, 0 bytes of dedicated support code:
diffstat 0001-gpiodev-api.patch
 gpiodev.h |   43 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Adding GPIODEV for GPIOs without dedicated device (would be less if
there was struct device already):

        While it's understood that your code contains refactors,
extensive error checking, debugging support, etc. it's clear that
gpiolib.c has some weight to drop into kernel.
        But I'm a bit stumbled by that code. What's that? Is it just
example of implementation of your approach? Or is it code to go into
kernel? In this case, it needs work - it doesn't adhere to your own
optimization scheme by using lookup table instead of list.
        Or is it again example of what should be done by folks who
want to use extensible GPIO at all - specifically, hacking platform
header to plug there such framework?
        In the latter case, we again speak about different things, or
about different levels of such things - you speak about constructor
parts which "anyone" can use to construct whatever GPIO API they like,
whereas I'm speaking about exact API implementation which can be used
right away.

        Well, besides gpio_keys we here have asic3_keys, samcop_keys,
etc. - all that duplication just because the current GPIO API doesn't
allow extensibility to more chips.

        Sorry, how could I? I didn't post a single line of C++ code,
vice-versa, posted patches in plain C, which work for any
platform/architecture/etc. Words like "interface" are used only on
design stage. After that, there's just C code ready for calls. There's
no "one implementation strategy is", "another implementation strategy
is", etc.

        Yes, in the same sense as some wheel-producing machine
disallows production of square and hexagon wheels.
        As I told, that was one of the reason I decided to submit
my patches as patches, not just RFC, and argue for them - there're
already bunch of square pegs in ARM Linux, and allowing only round
(or square) ones instead of both seems like refreshing change.

        Ok, so this, IMHO, keeps to be the most valid point in favor
of continuing to use flat GPIO namespace. Challenging that would mean
to challenge original requirements for API, and that was done in
January, and I don't want to return to that.

        No, just requirement to do superflous operations, like, first
adding something to something, then storing what was added somewhere in
the table, just to substract it later then.

        Yes, and simple resources can be even managed efficiently, as
GPIODEV API shows ;-).

        So, yes, I disagree that using scalar identifiers is the most
efficient method. I however hardly can disagree that it's still a
suitable method. My other arguments are of wider scope than GPIO API
per se.
        One thing I obviously agree is that we need standard extensible
GPIO API, no matter what it is. And of course, you, as the API maintainer,
have better insight into this topic, and need to preserve its local
consistency (even if that, per my view, follows things which deserve
nomination of anti-patterns).
        So, now the most important question is what we all would get
with your approach in the end.
        So, if you could make sure gpiolib.c doesn't contain inefficient
implementation, and make such extensible implementation available by
default for ARM PXA/S3Cxxx/OMAP, then it's for sure cover Handhelds.org's,
and many other peoples' usecases, and that would be highly
appreciated.
        If you could do it for 2.6.22 merge window, that would
straight ideal.

        I would agree with this from pragmatical approach -
our usecase for handhelds.org is the same, we don't do
bitbanging on GPIOs. Other thing is when people would need
it, but ... - everything was said in that respect already.

        My argument stays the same - it's C, so that's why it's
written that way. If that was Perl or Java, I would use hash to
convert from identifier to reference, but with C, it's optional.

        Why? There's already abstraction of a device - struct
device. A device provides GPIO operations, so the operations are
attached to struct device. Otherwise, for how long there will be
parallel structure proliferation? Almost all devices are already
struct device, but some of them also require separately maintained
structure - irq_chip, gpio_chip, etc. Merging of classdev vs dev
structures and their trees is on TODO, but in the meantime we'll
spawn bunch more parallel structures...
