Very right. Let me try to explain it again. It was just an idea, that
popped in my mind. I was not sure if it was good or bad, so, I decided to
dump it to lkml, so, that the people here could evaluate it. And, if it
can be of any use - use it. I, personally, don't care much (at least at
the moment) about binary drivers. And I most of all wanted to avoid
starting a new wave of flames. That's why I tried to avoid answering to
other posters (sorry, if it was somewhat impolite).

Thanks! You seem to have understood the idea pretty close to what I mean,
and, probably, you are better capable of explaining things, than I:-) But,
I think, if it is going to be discussed further, let's move it away from
LKML (you are right, Bart). It can either be discussed in private emails,
or, maybe someone could create a dedicated mailing list somewhere.
Thanks
