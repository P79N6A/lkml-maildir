Just dropping a note that I booted into single user mode today and tried mounting the VCD -- and it worked! So I guess, yeah, the problem must be something to do with HAL etc. Some change to the kernel probably breaks something in HAL (just a guess) .......... whatever, am stuck now coz I can't play VCDs until this problem is fixed! Heh!

Unfortunately nobody changed the behaviour just fixed bugs that were
hiding existing bad behaviour. Please take the polling mess up with the
HAL and KDE developers.
