In the scenario above, it costs you a lot. The memory is completely
used, else mozilla wouldn't get swapped out. If you swap it back in
and get rid of fs cache, the next kernel (compile|grep|whatever) will
be slower.
And even in the original scenario, it will be expensive, depending on
your machine. On a notebook, it costs you battery power, which is a
limited resource, *for sure*. You *may* save user time, which *may* be
a limited resource, but not always.
But sure, it is a fun project to hack on, just go ahead and show the
numbers. :)

And when it should be done. ;)
