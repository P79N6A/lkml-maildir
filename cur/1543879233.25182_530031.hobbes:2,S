I don't think width information for characters in BMP is going to change
that often.
By the way, a note about the size: the larger one of the two tables is
unused and hence optimised away by the compiler. I just left in the source
so that it only takes a minor modification for people go get a different
sane behavior (ie. ignore combining chars). So only the small table, with 11
pairs of longs (88 bytes) are compiled to the kernel.

I'll look at it, but I didn't want to alter the building procedure, modify
Makefiles... Or do you mean I should only ship the generated .c file plus
the script, instead of the (1MB) UnicodeData.txt and generating it compile
time? Sounds reasonable...

I've been thinking on it and I'm not sure which one the right way is. The
reason for choosing this was probably that this way information that is not
used by the code can be omitted by the compiler.
