   Funny thing in this was that it totally smashed the Solaris in the
   other end too, it ended up in a state where it couldn't run
   anything, probably because some networking buffers or something had
   eaten all memory (guessing from seeing some error messages on
   console).
My guess is that it was confused by the zero windows we were spitting
out in the bogus ACKs.
