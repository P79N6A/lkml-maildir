The layout is most likely going to be different anyway, isn't it?  We don't
know what has gone on in the past to get the FS into the current state.
But now we have more information than we did when the file system was
originally built.
We don't have an extent based interface do we?  So we can't say "I know
this file is going to be X bytes in size."  But if we accomplish nearly the
same thing by a quick copy like this, what's the harm?
