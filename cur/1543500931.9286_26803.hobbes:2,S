     The expensive part of this is the GB router.
     I did a smaller version of this when I was working with McAfee's
     Webshield (where I could sustain close to wire speed for as long as
     it took to find holes in the webshield tcp stack):
		   [server(s)]
			|
		     (100bt)

       [poor helpless 2.0.28+webshield box]
			|
		     (100bt)
			|
		     [switch]
		     ||||||||
		    5 machines
		   going to town.
    The clients each ran 20x copies of little perl scripts that
    simply ftp'ed parts of the kernel across and dropped it into
    /dev/null.
    (Modulo the gb connection, I could do that now, but I'd probably
    burn town my house with the electrical demand)
