Sounds like iptables and tcp wrappers are working?
Or you haven't enabled telnetd?

No, it wouldn't be running unless someone
has connected via telnet.

Right you don't start telnet by hand, its
invoked from inetd,or rather xinetd.

inetd has been replaced by xinetd, which
does seem to have some advantages.

Why not run "ntsysv",  and select telnet?
Or, edit /etc/xinetd.d/telnet and then type
"service xinetd restart".

That's as it should be
There is one thing - telnet is not a good thing
to have running, you really want to use secure
shell instead. If you have any concern at all
for security that is.
Finally, this has nothing to do with kernel
development, so try to reserve this list
for actual kernel related questions.
