Oops. I misread stop_machine(), it does kernel_thread(), not kthread_create().
So "stopmachine" threads are all re-parented to init when the caller exits.
I think it makes sense to set ->exit_state = -1 in stopmachine(), regadless
of any other changes.

Yes. But we can't create helper_wq ([kthread]) before init_workqueues().
We can call helper_init() from init_workqueues() before creating "events"
though.
