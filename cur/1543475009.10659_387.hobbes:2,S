So have I. And the missing separation between mode setup and drawing setup
in XFree86-3.x is nothing but a design flaw. XFree86-4.x will correct
that.

Actually, there are only three "serious" separate accelerated X servers
that are worth looking at. Mach64, I128, 3Dlabs. The rest are obsolete
because they are either supporting seriously outdated hardware (8514,
Mach8, etc) or are being superseded by other code (P9000, S3, S3V)

So do I. I would like to encourage people who would like to see 4.x do the
Right Thing wrt framebuffer devices to join The XFree86 Project and help
to unsure that the separation between mode setup and drawing setup can
support things like fbdev as well.
