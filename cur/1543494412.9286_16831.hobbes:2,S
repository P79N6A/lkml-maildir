Hello,
I've written a device driver under 2.0.37. Having acquired a block of
data, the interrupt routine add a timestamp obtained with do_gettimeofday.
In the higher layers, I compute the difference between two consecutive
timestamps to  assert there is no missing data.
Most of the time, diff time is 792 millisec, but sometime I find two
sequences,  one with 782 millisec, and the other with 802 millisec. The
deviation from normal sequence is 10 millisec, which is also 1/Hz (i386
arch)
I suppose that when my driver, from its interrupt routine, call
do_gettimeofday, there is a timer interrupt pending. Is it something I
could do to be sure the timer interrupt is serviced, if required, before
reading the time ?
Thanks in advance
