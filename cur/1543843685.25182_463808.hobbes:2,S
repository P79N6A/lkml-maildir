Thank you for the info.  In studying the code that's what my
impression was as well (that it would require a considerable effort).
I haven't encountered any problems with SATA in 2.4.33, but I guess
what I was concerned about was when/if it might become necessary to
migrate to 2.6.x in order to support newer hardware.  I guess I'll
know when I encounter it :)
