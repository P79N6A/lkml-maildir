That's nice idea, but it does not have any connection to subj.
I prefer to do things the way I do them now. Anyway I need compiler for other things.
I have lot of C/C++ daemons running, and want to fix problems right there.
But having Python just to configure a kernel is an overkill. Why not Sather, or other rarely used language.
Oberon-2 would be also nice.
This is just a laziness of people who do not want to make things right. Actually interesting question
is what Linus think of all this crap?
