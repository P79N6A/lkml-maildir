There're in fact a "dynamic swap" tool which apparently
does what mac os x do: 
http://dynswapd.sourceforge.net/
However, I doubt the approach is really useful. If you need that much
swap space, you're going well beyond the capabilities of the machine.
In fact, I bet that most of the cases of machines needing too much
memory will be because of bugs in the programs and OOM'ing would be
a better solution.
