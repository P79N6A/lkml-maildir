It has been pointed out by a couple of people that my mailer ate the patches.
You can find the original unmangled patches at:
http://www.stillhq.com/linux/patches/2.6.0-test4-bk5/
(look for mandocs_tweaks)
Thanks for your patience,
Mikal
PS: Linus' tree has changed under me, so I am going to have to update some of
these patches anyways, but it would still be nice to be informed of factual
errors within the patches.
