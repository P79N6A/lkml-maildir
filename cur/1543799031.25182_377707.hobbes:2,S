Again, I'm not much of a SCSI person, so you might be right here.
However, ejecting scsi devices, like firewire or usb disks, tends to
spin the devices down. This, to my understanding, allows for safe
removal (ipods stop flashing the "do not remove" message). 
On USB flash disks, I'd hope umounting the device would suffice in
flushing out any writes, but it seems quite a bit of writing can go on
when the eject command is issued. It might be I'm just being paranoid,
but I've always ejected flash drives as well just to be sure.
