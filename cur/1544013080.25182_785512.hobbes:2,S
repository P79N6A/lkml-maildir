I was thinking of only changing the debugfs file.

Good point. It only disables the recording, so perhaps a "record_enabled" 
would be better?

Yeah, the user does not know or care what the implementation is.

I think the name record_enabled for debugfs is the best. This is exactly 
what happens (not how it is implemented). When someone echos 0 to 
record_enabled (currently called tracing_on), it stops the recording, and 
nothing else. The tracers still try to write to the buffer, but the write 
always fails. This does not disable the tracers or even notify the tracer 
that the buffers have stopped recording. This is just a simple light 
weight way to stop and start recording to the trace buffers from either 
user space or kernel space.  Kernel space can stop it, and user space can 
start it again (that was the original request for this feature).
I'm leaning towards record_enabled now.

I still have 10 more hours, but who cares? ;-)
Happy New Year to you too!
