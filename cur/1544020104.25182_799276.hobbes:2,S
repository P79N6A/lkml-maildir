Ho humm. I have a feeling..
The legacy resume basically ends up doing just
	pci_restore_standard_config(dev)
in the resume_early path (in pci_pm_default_resume_noirq, which is shared 
with both the legacy and the new PM model).
The _new_ PM layer does that too (it's shared), but then in the regular 
resume sequence it _also_ does the pci_pm_reenable_device(), and I think 
this is key.
Why?
Look at pci_restore_standard_config(): it restores the PCI config space, 
but it does so _before_ actually turning the device into PCI_D0. And 
that's not actually guaranteed to work at all - if a device is in D3, you 
can still read from config space, but writing to it may or may not 
actually work.
This may explain why your PCIE bridge works when moving over to the new 
PM: because of the whole pci_pm_reenable_device() thing, we end up 
doing the pci_enable_resources() thing later, and now it's in PCI_D0, so 
now the device actually reacts to it.
This also explains why we don't care if we save the wrong state or not: 
even if we save state with IO/MEM disabled, we'll re-enable it at 
->resume() time.
HOWEVER, that's still buggy, since it's potentially too late, since any 
interrupts that come in before that will see the device without the IO/MEM 
set, leading to the whole "hung interrupt" issue again even if the device 
is now on.
So we really do want to restore the state to whatever saves state in the 
_early_ resume phase, both for legacy and new PM rules, I think. And we 
want to make sure that we restore state while the device is in D0, because 
otherwise I really think that it possibly could lose our writes.
(Somebody should check me on that - maybe I remember wrong, and config 
space writes are guaranteed to take effect even when something is in 
D3cold).
So I think we should:
 - make sure that the generic PCI layer saves the right state, for the new 
   PM model too. Don't save it if the driver already did (because the 
   driver may have turned off the device after saving the state)
 - make sure that the legacy PM layer turns the device on before it 
   restores the state, to make sure that it "takes".
I dunno. I haven't really walked through all the states, but _something_ 
like this might do it. Note the change to pci_pm_default_suspend_generic: 
we save the state only if the driver didn't do it already (which is also 
why I ended up having to move all the "dev->state_saved = false" things 
around), and we do not disable the device (because for all we know, the 
low-level drivers will still need access to the IO/MEM space even at the 
suspend_late stage!).
