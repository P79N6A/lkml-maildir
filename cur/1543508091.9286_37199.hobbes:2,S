Only as a short report of my research up to now:
I can load the AVM Fritz PnP/PCI without a problem on my SX164 system,
it get IRQ 26 here, and it got IRQ requests. So this problem have to do
with your hardware setup.
Kernel is the same as you use, but not the special IRQ 15 stuff.
But the BUG is here too, only later if I try to unload the module.
I need more time to find the reason.
