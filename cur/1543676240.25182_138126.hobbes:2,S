   To make this clear, mmap() on bar0 would get you
   a mapping of that BAR.
We have a way to portably mmap() PCI devices using just the device
node.
If you make this new method, you might have to define a whole
new set of arch level support hooks.
What I'm saying is, we should reuse all of this code we have
to support mmap()'ing PCI devices properly now (via procfs
device node files).
