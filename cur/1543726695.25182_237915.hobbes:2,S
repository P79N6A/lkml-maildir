It certainly looks that way from reading the patch. I was unaware of this 
patch (which looks a lot more thorough than mine).  Thank you for the 
link.
His patch makes the change to dio_find() , but I don't see any changes to 
drivers/net/hplance.c or drivers/video/hpfb.c - are the changes I made 
there not needed? those two treat a return value of 0 from dio_find() as 
an error as far as I can tell...
