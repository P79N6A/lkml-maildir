Your point about a common kernel api (across all architectures) is valid
and leads me to reconsider the use of common macros for the two atomic types.
So I guess I would lean in the direction you suggested of separate macros
(atomic64_add/sub/read etc.) for the atomic64_t type.
But I'm wondering if it would be acceptable to have the atomic64_t implemented
(initially) on only one platform?
My original intent was to get atomic64_t into the IA-64 linux kernel.
Mosberger suggested that the other 64-bit architecture maintainers should
weigh in on this issue and that I send the proposal to lkml.
I have no plans on implementing this for anything but the IA-64 linux kernel.
But its api should be discussed and approved (or disapproved) by this list.
The implementations for the other platforms can come as other people feel
so moved to do them.
