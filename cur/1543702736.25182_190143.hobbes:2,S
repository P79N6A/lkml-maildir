This crash was hard, and trashed the /usr partition.  Thats not so 
bad, but it took about 20 reboots to get it past fscking the 
/dev/hda8 (/usr) partition before I could get it back up.
No trace of the crash exists in the messages log, it quit logging 
about the time I shut the monitor off and went to bed, and when I 
found it totally unresponsive at 3:10, about 2.5 hours later.
However, getting past the e2fsck of /usr, aka /dev/hda8, was a bit 
frustrating as it would get to some arbitrary point, usually about 
halfway thru that 70Gb partition and get stuck in a loop outputting 
what I assume is debugging info, and finally ending in a kernel 
panic.
I took a picture of the screen at that point, but its a 3.2 mpixel 
camera so the .jpg file will be around 700k if anyone is interested 
in doing an autopsy on it.  I won't abuse the list with that big a 
file.
Also on the reboot, ksysguard cannot connect, but I've not lifted the 
hood on that one yet.
