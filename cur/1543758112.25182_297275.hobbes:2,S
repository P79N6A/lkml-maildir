Lots of people seem to be confused on this.  I even read an lwn.net
article that didn't seem to grok the distinction.
The realtime-preempt patches make the Linux kernel usable for soft and
hard realtime applications.
The realtime LSM just enables the administrator to let selected non-root
users use these capabilities.
The only relationship between the patches is that using the realtime LSM
is rather pointless without the realtime preempt patch, because if the
realtime performance of the Linux kernel isn't good enough, there's no
point in being able to let non root users use it.
