I suspect that no currently supported architecure is affected as long
as default calling conventions are used, but i386 would be affected if
__attribute__((stdcall)) is in effect. I suspect m68k is in a similar
situation as i386.

What you describe is the typical implementation, but it is a historical
accident and not necessarily the best choice from a performance
perspective. Before ANSI-C introduced prototypes, there was no way to
distinguish variadic from non-variadic functions. Thus all functions
had to use the same conventions, which typically were caller-pops since
that's what's needed for variadic functions. With prototypes it's usually
better to use a callee-pops convention, since that tends to reduce code
space and it allows for tailcalls without blowing the stack. Unfortunately
binary compatibility with pre-ANSI-C object code meant that most if not
all ABIs kept their pre-ANSI-C rules, i.e. caller-pops.
