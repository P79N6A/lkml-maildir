Hi Bill,
This is not the result of a recent change to the serial driver. I don't 
know how far back this bug goes, but I suspect it is as old as the proc 
fs serial support. 
The recent event was me adding memory mapped support for a couple of 
CompactPCI serial mux cards. Apparently everyone else on the planet 
uses I/O space (or just did not report it) and the driver/kudzu 
combination works fine with serial cards in I/O space. 
Do you want me to go ahead and put it into bugzilla? 
BTW, I have attached the procfs data produced with and without the 
driver bug.
Best regards,
Ed Vance
