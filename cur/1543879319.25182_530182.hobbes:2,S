The current functionality doesn't parse command line arguments into argv,
nor provide the % variable replacements in the environment, so it is
somewhat less useful than it could be.  I supposed that parsing the command
line introduces potential problems with file names that include whitespace.
It would probably be better to split the command-line on whitespace, then
replace variables in the argv[]?
fs/exec.c:
1507         if (corename[0] == '|') {
1508                 /* SIGPIPE can happen, but it's just never processed */
1509                 if(call_usermodehelper_pipe(corename+1, NULL, NULL, &file)) {
1510                         printk(KERN_INFO "Core dump to %s pipe failed\n",
1511                                corename);
1512                         goto fail_unlock;
1513                 }
1514                 ispipe = 1;
1515         } else
1516                 file = filp_open(corename,
1517                                  O_CREAT | 2 | O_NOFOLLOW | O_LARGEFILE | flag,
1518                                  0600);
