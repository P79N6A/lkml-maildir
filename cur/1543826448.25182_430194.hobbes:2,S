I took the swapless-pm-add-r-w-migration-entries.patch and -fix-2.patch
as a single patch and didn't test the ----'d level.  It worked anywhere
I tested up to and including the last one marked GOOD above.  Anywhere
below that was a mess.  Backing out those two patches (and a bunch of
dependant ones) seemed to make the problems we get very different, and
if Martin is right the same as problems we are seeing on other
architectures.  So I am leaning to the feeling that this part of -mm is
introducing a problem.

I uses an awful lot of very wierd swap things.    So possibly there is a
tie in there?
