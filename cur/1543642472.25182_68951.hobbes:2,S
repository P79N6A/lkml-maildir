Toshiba refused to lend us any laptops after repeated requests,
so all the toshiba work has been without a unit to test with.
There is at least one (that i remember) specific fix for toshiba
systems in the driver.
also does recording work at all?  i mostly tested with grecord.
so, look at cs4281_setup_record_src(), and maybe commenting out
the toshiba specific code concerning the recording sources might
make a difference. or if the unit is NOT recognized, then forcing
the code to setup as your unit as a 1640CDT and see if that
helps.
i'll think about it some more. let me know

You're right, all updates were already included in the 2.4.19
kernel. The only thing extra in your tarball is the 2.2 compat
code and two copy_to_user() return code fixes in cs4281_ioctl().
I wonder if it's some strange bug with the CS4281 hardware in
this Toshiba laptop:
00:08.0 Multimedia audio controller: Cirrus Logic Crystal CS4281
PCI Audio (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Toshiba America Info Systems: Unknown device
ff00
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 5
        Memory at fc010000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
        Memory at fc000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]
Does this ring a bell (pun intended) ?
regards,
Rik
