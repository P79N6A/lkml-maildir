We should also look at what drivers do depend on STANDALONE:
- some OSS drivers
- one DVB driver option (DVB_AV7110_FIRMWARE)
- ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT
The OSS drivers are more or less RIP, so let's ignore them.
Is DVB_AV7110_FIRMWARE really still required?
ALL other drivers work without such an option.
ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT seems to be the most interesting case.
It's anyway not usable for distribution kernels, and AFAIR the ACPI 
people prefer to get the kernel working with all original DSDTs
(which usually work with at least one other OS) than letting the people 
workaround the problem by using a custom DSDT.
It might therefore be possile simply getting rid of CONFIG_STANDALONE?

    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
