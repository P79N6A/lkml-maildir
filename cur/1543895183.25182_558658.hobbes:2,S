It's OK _only_ in case of unknown, hard to find *hardware* bugs.
If you think it's "a good thing" for bad, untested by developer
code, then something is completely wrong.
And if there's no debugger in the mainline kernel, which is developer's
tool, then why do you think testers must stick with git-bisect, as their
debugger-like tool (bandwidth in most and time consuming in some cases)?
That's wrong if developers are tending to reply only one thing --
git-bisect.
If things are going to be that bad, then better to start dealing with the
cause, not consequences. In this situation requesting test-cases is a
better way, as it's going to influence developer as cause of potential
problems. If tests will show *hardware* side of problem, then, well some
parts may be not obvious, thus bisecting is a way to continue.
Sorry if i'm from the abnormally different side yet one more time.
