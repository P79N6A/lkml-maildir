Subject: 2.4.20 problems with some multisession CD's and IDE chipsets

Hello,
I have found that 2.4.20 can't read some files from a multisession CD
(that was written with Adaptec DirectCD). I get
Feb 12 17:36:27 czarek kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 03:40 (hdb), sector 1109136
Feb 12 17:36:27 czarek kernel: hdb: cdrom_decode_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
(linux 2.2.22 reads the same file with no trouble).
I have also found that 2.4 corrupts data with some older VIA 82C686
mainboard, unless it is booted with the ide0=serialize parameter or DMA is
off (again, 2.2 works fine).
Regards,
C.S.
