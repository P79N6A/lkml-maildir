It looks like removing this line couldn't help.
Apparently, acpi_pci_link_set(link, link->irq.active) must be called
_before_ the call to pci_write_config_word() in
drivers/pci/pci.c:pci_set_power_state(), because the box hangs
otherwise.  However, with the patch applied,
acpi_pci_link_set(link, link->irq.active) is only called through
pcibios_enable_irq() in pcibios_enable_device(), which is _after_
the call to pci_set_power_state() in pci_enable_device_bars(),
so it's too late.
Hence, it seems, if you really want to get rid of the
irqrouter_resume(), whatever the reason, the simplest fix
seems to be to change the order of calls to pci_set_power_state()
and pcibios_enable_device() in pci_enable_device_bars():

though I'm not sure if that's legal.
