Subject: Kernel patch: keyboard.

    Hello everybody :))
    First of all, excuse me if this is not the proper place for sending
this patch, but I am somewhat... lost :(((
    I have tested this on ten keyboards, five of them under Debian 2.1,
three under Suse 6.2 and two under a-kind-of-red-hat-5.1, and worked
OK under all of them. I hope to see this patch included in, at
least, a prepatch version of the kernel :))))
    Well, this patch is about these three new keys that some new
keyboards have: suspend, resume and poweroff. These keys don't work
on Linux by default, and I have decoded their scancodes and included
them in the kernel keyboard conversion tables.
    Please, feel free to send this patch to whoever you want, and
thank you very much for your time and effort :)
    Raúl
