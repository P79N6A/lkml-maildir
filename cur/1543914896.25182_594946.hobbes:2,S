Dual licenced code by definition explicitely states that you can choose 
the licence - otherwise it wouldn't be called dual-licenced.

Noone said otherwise.

The licence in question was:

Is it really ethical to use a licence that does not require to give 
back, but then demand that something has to be given back?
Why don't you use a licence that expresses your intentions in a legally 
binding way?

You could also see it from a different perspective:
If you like that the GPL enforces that everyone has to give back, do you 
also want to see your code BSD licenced without this protection?
But the truth is a bit less harsh:
In reality most Linux kernel developers might not mind to give back - 
and e.g. much of the ACPI code is BSD/GPL dual-licenced, and there 
doesn't seem to be any problem with this.
But Theo's wrong accusations regarding dual licenced code might not be
the best way for starting a fruitful collaboration...

[2] The fact that Alan didn't notice that part of Jiri's patch touched
    non-dual-licenced code is the mistake I already mentioned - but
    this mistake is not what Theo is ranting about.
