Hi everyone,
	I had a hard disk die on me recently and after installing the new disk
and recovering my data I find that modprobe fails when loading
ip_masq_*.  This is with every new 2.2.0-pre* kernel.
modprobe: ip_masq_ftp: open: no such file or directory
modprobe: ip_masq_raudio: open: no such file or directory
modprobe: ip_masq_irc: open: no such file or directory
I am afraid something was lost in the disk crash (not all of backups
worked too well).  Does anyone know what is missing here?  The modules
really are installed in /lib/modules/2.2.0-pre7/ipv4.
