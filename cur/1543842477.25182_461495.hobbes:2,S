Sylpheed / Sylpheed-Claws
I don't remember every version but with Sylpheed-Claws 2.4.0 you can
configure it to wrap (or not):
- typed text
- quoted text
- pasted text
(Configuration -> Prefereces -> Compose -> Wrapping)
Moreover you have the "Insert File" button that inserts a file
"inline" (for wrapping it follows the "pasted text" rule).
Other useful things you can set are:
	outgoing encodig (I use ISO-8859-15)
	trensfer encoding (I use 8bit)
NOTE: if he can he falls back to US-ASCII / 7bit
