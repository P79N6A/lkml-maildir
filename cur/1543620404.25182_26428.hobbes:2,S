I can always rebuild the modules from a standard source tree, given the 
config.  This makes the config a far more important piece of data than the 
modules themselves, and that is why I want it stuck right on the side of the 
kernel, the way my memory sticks have a little sticker on them telling me 
what I've got.
As an option of course, you're welcome to build your kernel without it, and 
you can also peel the stickers off your memory sticks and file them in a 
drawer if you like.
