Hello there,
Does that also include the AT16 boards?. I have 2 in my posession which
I used to use under SCO 3.2v4.2 in those days. I once *HAD* a source code
version of it, but I scrambled the floppy which it was on. :-(((
The boards showed problems in the first months of use (random lockups).
After replacing the PLCC socket for the processor all went well.
Now I have abandoned SCO from my systems I would be pleased if I could use
them under Linux. :-)))
regards
Kees
