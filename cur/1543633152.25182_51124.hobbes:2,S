Two flaws and a problem:
Flaw 1:
The boot messages reveal what cards have been assigned what
ethN number for some, but not all cards. E.g.,
# dmesg | grep eth
eth0: 3c5x9 at 0x300, 10baseT port, address ..., IRQ 10.
eth2: RealTek RTL8139 Fast Ethernet at 0xd080d000, ..., IRQ 9
eth2:  Identified 8139 chip type 'RTL-8139A'
eth3: i82596 ...
#
What is eth1? This information seems not easily available.
I once gave a patch - can dig it up again if there is any interest.
The kernel should report, preferably in a uniform way,
ethN: Vendor Model, MAC address, ...
Flaw 2:
Debugging output:
phy=0, phyx=24, mii_status=0xffff
phy=1, phyx=0, mii_status=0xffff
...
phy=24, phyx=23, mii_status=0xffff
phy=25, phyx=25, mii_status=0xffff
...
phy=31, phyx=31, mii_status=0xffff
  ***WARNING*** No MII transceivers found!
Problem:
[The above two flaws apply to many kernel versions.
However, today, upon booting 2.5.20 net connection failed.]
