Obviously the problem is using Apache and mod_perl -- the most useless
possible examples.
More appropriate examples are processes that don't allocate any memory
one they have started -- they just run.  Control systems and the like.
I can't quite think which ones off hand.  Maybe an Occam interpreter :-)
Anyway, if you have those running, preventing overcommit, for those
processes at least, means they will not be terminated by out of memory
conditions.  You don't need 3Gb in that case.
Admittedly, on a typical Linux box programs that don't allocate memory
(or call fork or use kernel services that allocate memory) are few and
far between.
