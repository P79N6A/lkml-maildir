Dick,
IIRC IBM produced a 486-like chip under license from Intel for their
short-lived PS/1 line.  This chip had no FPU and was similar, but not 100%
identical, to Intel's 486SX.  I believe IBM called it a 486SL and soldered
it directly to the PS/1 motherboard.  That improved the PS/1's reliability,
but made it impossible to upgrade.
Modifying the cpuinfo discovery code to support the 486SL should be fairly
straightforward.  Feel like working out the code and contributing a patch?
