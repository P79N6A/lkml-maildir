OK. However, I need to find a temporary solution before someone
implements this new mecanism (I don't think I can do it with my current
knowledge of Linux mm). I would prefer avoiding walking the page tables,
this is complex and I've seen all Linus promises of quick death to
whoever would try to do that ;-)
What happens if I simply try to create an additional mapping for an
existing page ? Basically, what happens if I use ioremap on the physical
location of a kmalloc'ed page ?
Of course, I will end up having two virtual mappings to the same page,
but if I make sure to only actually use the uncachable one, will there be
a problem ? Would something prevent ioremap from creating a mapping for a
physical page in the SDRAM range ?
Regards,
Benjamin.
