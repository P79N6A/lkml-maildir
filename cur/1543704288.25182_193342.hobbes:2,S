so, apparently the problem was that i just needed to enable dma...  which meant
that i needed to set "CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX=y" in my .config.
been running all night/morning with load - no "losing ticks" message or slowing
clock yet.  thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
think we could improve that error message?  i'd never have guessed that it was
hard disk related if you hadn't told me...
