Gunther --
  Your patch is out of date.  But yesterday I posted practically the
same patch for the workaround using the current kernel defines. This patch
was tested across multiple platforms and devices and shown to work.
(caveat -- one cdrw is still having issues, but that is orthagonal to the
 patch)
Also, the unusual_devs.h  device definition will not work.  See my
patch for the multiple devices and their different requirements.
Your patch would break nearly everybody's equipment.
do not apply gunther's patch, please.
