Unfortunately it isn't right.  See, we set the peronality prior to looking up
the elf interpreter because different types of executables can have different
filesystem namespaces.  open_exec() needs it.  The IBCS stuff needs this, as
well as (thanks davem):
 "When we have a personality like "SunOS" or whatever, we allow the usage
  of an alternate '/' for file lookups, it trumps whatever would be found in
  the normal /, so we could put the SunOS ld.so under /emul/SunOS/lib for
  example using an emulation alternative-root of /emul/SunOS"
And we can't dump the currect exec image until we've determined that the
interpreter is available.
So it's all a bit of a stew.  We're back to the original patch.  Could you
please test it?  (This includes the ia64 bit)
