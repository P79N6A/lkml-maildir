Hi Pavel,
Just did some benchmarking; results below.

- Following as tests for original test code - not any kernel port of this.
- Test with each block size repeated 5 times - taken avg. of these 5 runs.
- Same file used for each test.
- Used lzotest utility (included with LZO 2.02) for testing.
Blocksize	Comp*		DU*		DS*		Speed%
4		59.356		211.526		195.260		7.689
8		54.623		202.712		188.369		7.075
16		50.342		196.482		183.988		6.358
32		47.499		189.800		177.455		6.504
64		44.148		178.724		167.201		6.447
128		42.125		170.229		159.257		6.445
256		41.830		155.035		146.115		5.753
* All speeds in MB/sec
Comp = LZO1X-1
DU = Decompress (unsafe)
DS = Decompress (safe)
Speed% = ((DU-DS)/DU)*100
I have yet to see how the kernel ports compare against this original version.
Cheers,
Nitin
