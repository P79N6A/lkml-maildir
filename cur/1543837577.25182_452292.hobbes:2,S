Sounds good!

I am happy to go either way -- the patch with the memory barriers
(which does have the side-effect of slowing down kfifo_get() and
kfifo_put(), by the way), or a patch removing the comments saying
that it is OK to invoke __kfifo_get() and __kfifo_put() without
locking.
Any other thoughts on which is better?  (1) the memory barriers or
(2) requiring the caller hold appropriate locks across calls to
__kfifo_get() and __kfifo_put()?
							Thanx, Paul
