We will need an implementation that will fall back to sys_sysctl for older
kernels. This is already common practice in glibc. I don't really
understand the performance concern because it seems to me that
_is_smp_system() is only called once per process.
But isn't this the kind of thing that the Aux Vector is for? I like vDSO
too, but I think it is best deployed for information of a more dynamic
nature and performance sensitive.
