OK, I just tried that.  I know there are scripts to resynthesize
changesets from the CVS info but I skipped that for now and just pulled
each day's work into a separate bzr revision.  It's up to the end of
March and still running.
Importing the first snapshot (2004-01-01) took 41.77s user, 1:23.79
total.  Each subsequent day takes about 10s user, 30s elapsed to commit
into bzr.  The speeds are comparable to CVS or a bit faster, and may be
faster than other distributed systems. (This on a laptop with a 5400rpm
disk.)  Pulling out a complete copy of the tree as it was on a previous
date takes about 14 user, 60s elapsed.
I don't want to get too distracted by benchmarks now because there are
more urgent things to do and anyhow there is still lots of scope for
optimization.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if those times could be
more than halved.  I just wanted to show it is in (I hope) the right
ballpark.
