Hi , Folks:
In the future 2.4  Linux Kernel, is there any modification on Linux
Traffic Control?
Can I use netfilter (firewall and NAT) and Linux Traffic control
simultaeously in the same kernel?
Do they conflict with each other? I am wondering they may share some
common variables in kernel.
Can you give me some URL about netfilter and linux traffic control?
Kernel -level information such as how the packets traverse in the kernel
is welcomed.
Please send reply to my email address. I am not on the kernel list.
Thanks in advance.
regards
zzs
