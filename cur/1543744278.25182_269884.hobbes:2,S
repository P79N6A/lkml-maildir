Since I don't exactly know what this means and currently don't have the 
time to find out I don't think so.
And if WoL should be done using ethtool, my patch should be ignored and 
the one of Daniele Venzano (posted to netdev@oss.sgi.com) should be 
considered.
(Will gather some more background information before posting a patch 
next time ;) )
