as much as i like the multiplicative hash function, i think Linux should
go with Peter's shift-add function for these reasons:
1.  it's simple
2.  it works independent of the multiplication speed or word size of the
CPU, so we don't need an "architecture dependent" function
3.  it works well enough

it totally depends on the workload.  i can get it to grow pretty large.
