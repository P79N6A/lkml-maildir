Speaking of this sleep_on+unlock race that is still present in a few drivers,
how about adding sleep_on_unlock(wait_q, lock) that would unlock the supplied 
lock at the right time, after adding the process to the wait queue?  This
race used to be present in the scsi code and has been fixed with the folowing 
(comments removed):
                if (wait) {
                        DECLARE_WAITQUEUE(wait, current);
                        add_wait_queue(&device->scpnt_wait, &wait);
                        if( interruptable ) {
                                set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
                        } else {
                                set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
                        }
                        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&device_request_lock, flags);
                        schedule();
			...
That's essentially what sleep_on_unlock() would do and problematic drivers
should be able to adopt easily.  Requiring global_cli or lock_kernel to sleep 
safely seems unnecesarily expensive.
