Hello all,
I promised to keep you updated on my results, concerning the tests of my
comparison between NT/IIS and Linux/Apache.
The general result is: with one 100 MBit interface nothing really
spectacular happens. Differences are in the range of 10%
With two interfaces, Linux clearly looses.
I set up a page with some detailled infos
(
http://www.heise.de/ct/Redaktion/ju/linux-perf.html
).
Please don't link to this page, as it will disappear, as soon as my
article is ready. It is meant as an information for you, not as a public
ressource.
Some quite interesting results are about SMP-Performnace and Andrea's
patches.
Comments are welcome (I have not subscribed to the lists, so please CC
me)
thanks again for your help, ju
