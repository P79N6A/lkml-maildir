Maybe someone remember me whining about troubles with 2.6.21-rt2..18 on my
Core2 T7200 laptop (fujitsu-siemens amilo i1520).
Althought I'm still with my fingers crossed, I can tell the good news are
that 2.6.21.5-rt19 (and -rt20) does behave far better now on the very same
box.
I've more than 8 hours up and running now, without a single glimpse of the
bad symptoms, which used to show in a matter of minutes if not earlier
during init time.
Congratulations. I'm not sure whether this problem can be closed for good,
though, just because you mention the slowness fix applies to CONFIG_NOHZ=Y
and I'm quite sure my badness surged either way.
But at least -rt is usable again here and that just makes me happier :)
Cheers.
