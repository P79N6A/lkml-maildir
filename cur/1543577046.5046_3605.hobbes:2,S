"ripped the support" is a bit nice for a thing that causes here
a hard freeze.
Famous last word:
Jan  1 19:34:52 xterm kernel: MSDOS: Hardware sector size is 2048
ext2 works, but it's extremely slow (compared to linear write using
dd)
"Don't do it then" is a bit hard, because I use "-t auto" on mount
and both 2048 && 512 byte medias  (yes, the girl that leaves my bed
when I enter it uses msdos on 512b/sect medias).
I don't know how hard a fix would be, I don't need it but I only want
to avoid crashes.
