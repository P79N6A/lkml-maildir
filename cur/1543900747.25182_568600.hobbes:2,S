Hi Pavel,
just a sidenote - usbkbd.c is probably a confusing misnomer, renaming it 
to something more appropriate is on my todo for one day. It is not the 
driver that controls the USB keyboard on the majority of systems - see 
Kconfig help text, that explains it very clearly. USB keyboards are 
normally handled by usbhid module (drivers/hid/usbhid/*).
