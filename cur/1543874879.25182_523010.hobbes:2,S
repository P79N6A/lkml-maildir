Simplicity is really key.

No problem.

As I am on 2.6.20, I can't really test this patch, but I tried your sched 
from PlugSched and its not bad.
I'm getting strange numbers with chew.c, though.  Try this:
Boot into /bin/sh
Run ./chew on one console.
Run ./chew on another console.
Watch latencies.
Console 1:
pid 671, prio   0, out for  799 ms, ran for  800 ms, load  50%
pid 671, prio   0, out for  799 ms, ran for  801 ms, load  50%
pid 671, prio   0, out for  799 ms, ran for  799 ms, load  49%
pid 671, prio   0, out for  800 ms, ran for  800 ms, load  49%
Console 2:
pid 672, prio   0, out for  800 ms, ran for  799 ms, load  49%
pid 672, prio   0, out for  799 ms, ran for  800 ms, load  50%
pid 672, prio   0, out for  799 ms, ran for  800 ms, load  50%
pid 672, prio   0, out for  799 ms, ran for  799 ms, load  49%
pid 672, prio   0, out for  799 ms, ran for  799 ms, load  49%
Looks good, but now add a cpu-hog, ie. while :; do :; done
Console 1:
pid 671, prio   0, out for  799 ms, ran for  399 ms, load  33%
pid 671, prio   0, out for  799 ms, ran for  399 ms, load  33%
pid 671, prio   0, out for  799 ms, ran for  399 ms, load  33%
pid 671, prio   0, out for  799 ms, ran for  399 ms, load  33%
Console 2:
pid 672, prio   0, out for 1599 ms, ran for  799 ms, load  33%
pid 672, prio   0, out for 1599 ms, ran for  799 ms, load  33%
pid 672, prio   0, out for 1599 ms, ran for  800 ms, load  33%
pid 672, prio   0, out for 1599 ms, ran for  799 ms, load  33%
It's smooth, but latencies are double on console2.  Easy enough to fix, 
though, just press scrollock to induce a sleep and then release.
Also, latencies are huge.  Is there a way to fix latencies per nice?
Thanks!
