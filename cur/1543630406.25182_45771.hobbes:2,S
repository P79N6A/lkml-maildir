I like!  I agree, if the task is not runnable then it should be
sufficient to just set task->cpu as when it is activated it will be put
into the runqueue based on ->cpu.
There was a chance even without the CPU affinity runqueues a process
would dequeue before set_cpus_allowed returned.  Look at the case in
migration_thread where exactly what your patch does is done.  If !array,
then the code just sets task->cpu and returns.
Ingo?  Good?
