This is just exactly how NTFS does work: there's an unnamed stream (which is 
the one that the majority of userspace programs do manipulate) which contains 
the user data (the pixels from a PMG image, or text from a text file, etc.), 
and there are named streams which not all kind of applications do know how to 
handle.
