Note that I don't think PowerOp would cover all devices. In fact, I
think most devices would remain autonomous or controlled as part of
specific subsystems. The only things that PowerOp would bundle together
would be things that aren't independent (and may not even be visible as
"devices" in the usual Linux sense), but that have to be managed
together in changing frequency/voltage. At least, that's the way I
imagined it would work.

| Problem is not only CPUs, devices are mostly independent in PC
| case... it would be nice to solve that problem with same approach.
