please check 2.4.17pre4aa1, see the per-classzone info, they will
prevent all the problems with the refill inactive with highmem.

done ages ago here.

yes, however I think the swap-flood with no swap isn't a very
interesting case to optimize.

dunno about this modify_ldt failure.

I don't have any pending bug report. AFIK those bugs are only in
