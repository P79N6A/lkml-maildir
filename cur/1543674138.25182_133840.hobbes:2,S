I know, but even that one is hard to do w/out the machine under your nose ;)

I had no doubt about that either.

Nope, I still see 0x4* commands for all devices != from USB. So more then
a "move" is an extension.

Instead of just trolling, isn't there a documentation about this chipset ?
The SIS web site is pretty/very weak about docs.
