I have a problem, Con.  The patch itself works fine for me, BUT it doesn't 
update the version.h available in 
/lib/modules/2.6.20-ck1/source/include/linux to include the -ck1 in the 
reported kernel version when trying to build an fglrx driver with the 
latest ati driver builder.  
Which leaves this error message in /usr/share/fglrx/flgrx-install.log:
[root@coyote fglrx]# cat fglrx-install.log
[Message] Kernel Module : Trying to install a precompiled kernel module.
[Message] Kernel Module : Precompiled kernel module version mismatched.
[Message] Kernel Module : Found kernel module build environment, 
generating kernel module now.
ATI module generator V 2.0
==========================
initializing...
Error:
kernel includes at /lib/modules/2.6.20-ck1/build/include do not match 
current kernel.
they are versioned as ""
instead of "2.6.20-ck1".
you might need to adjust your symlinks:
- /usr/include
- /usr/src/linux
[Error] Kernel Module : Failed to compile kernel module - please consult 
readme.
==========================
Unforch, the installer does not leave a readme behind that I've been able 
to find, nor does it report the error on-screen.
The above files are not simlinks here on this FC6 install.  And of 
course /usr/src/linux does not exist allthough I could set it up for the 
duration of a rebuild/reinstall cycle of my script.
Can we have a patch to address this?  Or should I just hardcode it since 
it will never be linked to any other later kernel?
I tried that in the src tree's include/linux/version.h, but it was 
refreshed back to the original regex code by the make, so that's not 
where to do it obviously.  I've also made the simlink in /usr/src, but 
since a kernel make re-writes version.h, that didn't help.
Whats next?
