sysfs shares the main problem with wireless extensions: It configures one 
value per file / per ioctl. Setting up a wireless card to associate or form 
an IBSS network consists of multiple parameters, many requiring the card to 
disasscociate.
With hardware like prism2 usb that gets "don't touch me now mode" for a while 
after a join command is issued, current API requires a driver to delay 
starting an association in order to wait if other config requests are issued 
- an ugly hack.
I vote for netlink. It's a defined and tested interface and has all features 
needed to set multiple values in one transaction.
