OR :
- you work for people that absolutely freak out because you compile 
and/or patch your own kernel (yet you continue to torture them by doing 
so - hehe)
- you spend 80 hours a week on your job and don't have time to mess with 
building and maintaining your own kernels (where's the laziness here?)
- you are subject to certain rules and regulations that require a 
"vendor" to stand behind the various pieces of software that comprise 
your system (yeah I know, really lame, but a reality)
