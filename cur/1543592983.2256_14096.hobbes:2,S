I registered a new directory and its tree in the proc filesystem with
some register_sysctl_table. And naturally I use unregister_sysctl_table
when the module is unloaded.
And everything seems to work fine.
Execpt that I can't read the corresponding data with the 'cat' command.
A 'strace'
shows me that 'cat' is in a loop :
...
read(3, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"...,
1024) = 1024
write(1, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"...,
1024) = 1024
read(3, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"...,
1024) = 1024
write(1, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"...,
1024) = 1024
...
I'm using my own function to change the data value, but helped by
proc_dointvec.
My function doesn't seem to be called.
Does anybody ever met something like this ?
Thanks
