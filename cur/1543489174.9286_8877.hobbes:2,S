Hm. I got your attention :-)

Ah, I see.

Yes, given the x86 compatibility, I agree with that.

Sigh. Or MIPS. It's a shame, but I have to agree with your
reasoning. I hadn't considered the x86 compatibility aspect.

Yes, it is, although I don't get to choose the binary format of
data. And memory mapping is so much better than plain reading.
Anyway, nevermind.
