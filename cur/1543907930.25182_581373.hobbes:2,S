Most - but not *all*.
Actually I quite agree with Linus - unwinder is just a pain,
which is the more unreliable then a plain call trace.
Plain call trace has one advantage - it prints more then needed
but it always print the required and clear info.
unwinder goes totally mad when something serious happens like stack
overflows/corruption or other bad thing. 2 my cents.

no. bogus entries don't make call trace irrelevant.
And it is very easy to find relevant call trace entries in std output -
call trace should always be correct from the top and from the bottom,
all other entries are checked by eip following the calls.
