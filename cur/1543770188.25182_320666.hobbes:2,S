In the first calculation, I think you are trying to 'round up'.  If this
is the case, then I believe the calculation should be:
usemapsize = (zonesize + ((1 << (MAX_ORDER-1)) - 1) >> (MAX_ORDER-1);
I don't know if there is a similar issue in the second calculation.
Arithmetic is not one of my strengths.
