I'm trying to get i810 DRM working with a Dell Dimension L800r with
onboard i810 video.  I'm using the same X configuration (4.2.0) that
worked fine with the generic Mandrake 8.2 kernel and didn't work with a
vanilla 2.4.19 (no 4.2.0 DRM, obviously).  Dmesg shows me the following
with 2.4.20-pre5:
Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 93M
agpgart: Detected an Intel i810 E Chipset.
agpgart: detected 4MB dedicated video ram.
agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xf8000000
[drm] AGP 0.99 on Intel i810 @ 0xf8000000 64MB
[drm] Initialized i810 1.2.0 20010920 on minor 0
However, lsmod shows me the i810 module as being unused when I start X,
and I get no error in my XFree86.0.log that I can see besides "(==)
I810(0): Direct rendering disabled".  I've attached my full dmesg and
XFree86.0.log, is there anything obvious I might have missed and does
anyone have i810 DRM working with 4.2.0 in this latest pre?  I'm not on
the list, so please CC me.  Thanks in advance.
