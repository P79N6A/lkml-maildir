Yeah - I figured that out. I found that there were many places where
KMALLOC_MAXSIZE was being used in buz.c so I removed CONFIG...ZORAN and the
kernel is working now.
It looks like the tulip driver isn't as up-to-date as the one from
2.4.2-ac20 - when is 2.4.3-ac1 due? :-) I got NETDEV WATCHDOG errors shortly
after rebooting with 2.4.3, although these were of the "slow/packet lossy"
type I got with 2.4.2-ac20 instead of the "network completely unusable" type
I got with 2.4.2-ac11 and earlier.
