For the PC side read the PCI 2.1 specification. It say precisely what is 
allowed and what isnt allowed on the PCI side and what a bridge may merge and 
the ordering rules. There are no "might"s involved in the PCI bridge side of
things.
For CPU side merging Im not sure of the rules.

things. On the I2O message posting its a "must have"
