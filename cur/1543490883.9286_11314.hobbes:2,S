Hello All,
I'm on the linux-kernel-digest, and use 'splitdigest' to convert the
digests back to regular mails, which I read with pine.
Lately I started seeing a lot of digests where no From: line could be
found by pine in the messages.
Turns out that it has to do with the character set (see header excerpt
below). Apparently, this X-Warning results in character replacement.
Specifically, "=" becomes "=3D", some other characters are replaced in a
similar way (the "F" from "From:" too...), and soft line breaks are lines
ending with "=".
I wrote the attached small proggy to deal with this, and inserted it in
my .qmail-linux-kernel-digest script and it seems to do the jobs just
fine.
So, if any of you experience the same problem, you are welcome to give it
a try. It's a simple stdin->stdout program that replaces the "=3D" and
related sequences.
Cya,
Jelle.

X-Warning: Original message contained 8-bit characters, however during
           the SMTP transport session the receiving system was unable to
           announce capability of receiving 8-bit SMTP (RFC 1651-1653),
           and as this message does not have MIME headers (RFC 2045-2049)
           to enable encoding change, we had very little choices.
X-Warning: We ASSUME it is less harmful to add the MIME headers, and
           convert the text to Quoted-Printable, than not to do so,
           and to strip the message to 7-bits.. (RFC 1428 Appendix A)
X-Warning: We don't know what character set the user used, thus we had to
           write these MIME-headers with our local system default value.
