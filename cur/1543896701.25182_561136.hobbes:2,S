This is stated on the assumption that pretty much all performance
critical tasklets have been removed (although Christoph just mentioned
megaraid_sas, but after I made this statement).
We've been running tasklets as threads in the -rt kernel for some time
now, and that hasn't bothered us.
The problem with tasklets is that they still don't provide guaranteed
performance. They can still be pushed off to ksoftirqd on a busy system.
But having *all* tasklets as they are today, keeps them at a higher
priority then any process in the system.
