I'm having the following problem which appears to be a kernel
problem. Essentially I am unable to play audio CD's using the
CD-ROM. The following errors appear whenever I attempt this:
  CD audio: ioctl error on /dev/cdrom: cmd=CDROMVOLCTRL errno=38
  CD audio: ioctl error on /dev/cdrom: cmd=CDROMREADTOCHDR errno=38
  CD audio: ioctl error on /dev/cdrom: cmd=CDROMREADTOCHDR errno=38
  CD audio: ioctl error on /dev/cdrom: cmd=CDROMREADTOCHDR errno=38
  CD audio: ioctl error on /dev/cdrom: cmd=CDROMREADTOCHDR errno=38
  TOC ERROR: No Disc ID found at /usr/bin/ripit.pl line 209, <CDTOC> chunk 1.
My system is:
   PII 300MHz
   256 Mb RAM
   Wearness CD-820 CD ROM
   Creative Labs Soundblaster AWE-64 Gold Sound card
   ASUS Motherboard
I came across the problem after upgrading from Suse 6.2 (running
kernel 2.2.10) to Suse 6.3 (running kernel 2.2.13). 
Audio functioned perfectly using 2.2.10, but does not function on
kernels 2.2.13 and 2.2.14. I am able to read data discs from the
CD-ROM as well as play audio files that are on the hard-drive. 
I've compiled sparse kernels as well as megalithic kernels for 2.2.10,
2.2.13 and 2.2.14 with only the 2.2.10 versions having the audio
working. I've compiled different versions of the kernels using the
same and different modules without fixing the problem.
Reluctantly, I am forced to conclude that a bug crept into the kernel
somewhere between 2.2.10 and 2.2.13. I've hunted through mailing list
archives and documentation without finding a solution to the problem.
Many thanks,
Adrian
