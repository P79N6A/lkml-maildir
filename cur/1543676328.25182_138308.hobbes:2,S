I recreated the trees from scratch.  I did not do extensive checks to make
sure these are OK but I did checkout the head of both the 2.4 and the 2.5
CVS trees and diffed them against the BK tree and they were the same.
No promises that the revision numbers stayed the same so if things seem 
weird throw away your CVS workspace and check them out again.
