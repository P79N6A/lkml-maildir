Hi,
I've read somewhere that the SATA controllers are backward compatible
with PATA controllers. Does this mean that a SATA controller can be used
with standard PATA drivers (especially the Intel ICH5)?
I have got an shiny new motherboard with SATA and a ditto SATA harddrive
just sitting unrecognized by a 2.4.20 kernel. The PATA part of my Asus
P4C800 D with my DVD-ROM on it is recognized nicely, the SATA part
however doesn't show. Is there a way around this (like with IDEx=)? I'd
really like to have linux on my new box...
Cheers,
Jurgen
