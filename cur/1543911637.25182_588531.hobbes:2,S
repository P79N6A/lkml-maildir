How odd!  This means that the guest set the kernel to a stack which it
hadn't mapped writable (or perhaps not mapped at all).  I always run SMP
kernels, and that seems a very strange side effect of a patching
problem...
Nonetheless, I did have a previous problem with a bug in the patching
code which didn't show up native and did show up under lguest.
Can you send your config?  Do you need noreplace-smp even on 2.6.23-rc3,
or only 2.6.23-rc3-mm1?
Thanks,
Rusty.
