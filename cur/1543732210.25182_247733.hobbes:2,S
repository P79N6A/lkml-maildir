Thanks for pointing out the specific config options.
Granted a more recent config is warranted .. the one I'm using is
2.6.0-based.  But considering I ran make oldconfig on this and chose
the defaults in each and every case, should I end up with a config that
doesn't compile?  Is there still a config issue here, especially
considering that both rc1 and rc1-mm1 compiled fine using this method?
Or is make oldconfig only going to help for a version or two back?
