    I've just changed my mind about which series it'd beliong too -- propply 
need to post [0/n] message before the series....

    Too bad. :-)
    I don't find the idea if the open coded masks depnding on HPT3*_ALLOW_ATA* 
for a catch all udma_filter() method especially tempting to. :-)

     I've probably dropped that part in anticipation of adding mdma_filter... 
I agree -- future has always come. B-)

    Like I said, I don't want to be tied by HPT3*_ALLOW_ATA* here and there 
(BTW, this approach was in revision #0 which I've never published :-).

    I'll respin RSN... but not take #2, alas. B-)
