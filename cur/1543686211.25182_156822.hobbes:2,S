This follows the same order that the SMP reboot code has been using
for ages. I did check disable_IO_APIC(), and it does not depend on
the BP's local APIC being enabled.
I don't think there is a bug, but if there is, it's in the original
code too (simply trace what an SMP kernel on UP_IOAPIC HW would do).
