I realise this is horribly OT, but I'm hoping that someone
here has gone through this and found a solution.
I am trying to find a non-winmodem, controller based (so
that it will work in linux without needing an HSF or HCF
driver) PCI modem that will work in a 3.3v PCI slot like
those of an IBM x335.
Preferably a model that will work in Japan :)
Thanks (and sorry again for the OT post :)
