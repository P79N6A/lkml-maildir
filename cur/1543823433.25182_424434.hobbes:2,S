I already have this patch queued up but I was half-wondering whether to not
send it in for 2.6.17.  Partly because the kernel actually links and
apparently works, which is a rarity when memory hotplug is concerned.
And partly because, well, just look at the patch.  It will give the kernel
new global symbols add_memory() and remove_memory().  So how come it links
OK at present?  And how do we know that it'll link correctly with all
configs once those symbols are added?  If it _does_ link OK with these
symbols added then they're not needed anyway.
So there's something fishy going on here.
