Hi !
To the minix-fs-maintainers:
Im just running 2.3.99-pre1 and noticed that the minix fs now
prints out an annoying "allocated inode foo is within quota" every
time a file is created. The code involved is in fs/minix/bitmap.c
lines 297-306. I suggest wrapping it with some DEBUG-#ifdef or
just making sure it gets printed only when there is some error.
Thanks,
Walter
