Only if the filesystems were using VFS interfaces which used kiobufs.
Right now, the only filesystem using kiobufs is XFS, and it only
passes them down to the block device layer, not to other filesystems.

What exactly is the justification for IO cancellation?  It really
upsets the normal flow of control through the IO stack to have
voluntary cancellation semantics.
