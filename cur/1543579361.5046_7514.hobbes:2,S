Hello!

It is not.
setsockopt() is simply a bit more clever extension to ioctl(),
which is adapted (in bsd style though) to understand layering
and has an explicit length to data.
It is prefered for all the operations on sockets,
and it is "must", if argument is not plain integer or operation
is specific to some protocol layer.

It is one algorithm. They differ only by amount of incomplete segments
allowed to be in flight. I.e. (in order of increased latency):
"nodelay" - Infinity
unnamed   - > 1
"nagle"   - 1
"cork"    - 0
