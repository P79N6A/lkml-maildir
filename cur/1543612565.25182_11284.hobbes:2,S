Well if all the infromation those functions are needing would
be already in block_device in place, that it could become as easy
as just passing &block_device there.
However please note that replacing kdev_t in the scsi layer
with just passing the minor can be done already *now* without
any pain. The same applies to the excessive MINOR lookups in the
v4l code. I did this already some time ago  (patch was here - about one
year ago)

Thta's no problem. But they should be used as hash values no the
syscall implementation level and nowhere else.
