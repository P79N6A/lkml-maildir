I don't think this approach is tenable.
If a distribution should ship with a "fixed" kernel and
compiler enabling the new direction flag behavior, any
binary you create on that system will be broken on any
other existing system.
I think we really are stuck with this forever, overwhelming
practice over the past 15 years has dictated to us what the
real ABI is.
