This is _horrible_. Suddenly there are files whose attributes aren't fixed
by chmod(1)/chown(1), but by a magic file. 
Again. The way Unix is designed, permanent information about files resides
in the filesystem. Another basic Unix design premise is that devices are
files. So their attributes reside in the filesystem. Anything else breaks
much ("tar cf dev.tar /dev", ..., "tar xf dev.tar /dev" doesn't work
anymore (but it looks like it does!); can't dump/restore /dev; ...). It
might also have _very_ serious security implications (what if the magic
devfs.conf file goes missing, or is clobbered?)
