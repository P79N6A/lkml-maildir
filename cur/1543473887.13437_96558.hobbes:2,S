Hi all
I have some problems mounting an vfat partition on 2.2.0-prex kernel. I
receive this message when mount it:
fat_read_super: Bad fsinfo_offset
and this partition has 200M free, after I mount it on linux this free space
disappeared. So I have to launch some application like "Defrag" to have this
free space again. Anyone could say me what happened ???
Since now, thanks
