boot-up: texpire (from leafnode node-server) together with
setiathome-client and some daemons coming up.
load is somewheren between 2.0 and 3.0, and I think mostly this
texpire thing is giving the load. running in background is several
things like MXM (==MTA), squid, vgetty, dnsserver, dhcp-server, etc.
I experienced these problems with kernel 2.2.12 *AND* 2.2.7! (!!!!!)
So, now I'am back to 2.0.38 which gives no problems at all.
