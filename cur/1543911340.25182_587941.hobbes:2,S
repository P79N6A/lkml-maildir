The exception c01 in kernel_execve is just the system call entry.  The
real problem is the machine check that happened in rb_insert_color,
called from __vma_link_rb.
However, a machine check is an imprecise exception, so whatever caused
the problem may have happened a little earlier than that.  Most likely
it is due to an attempt to access a physical address where nothing
exists.
