Gentlemen,
	I've remained quiet on this ever-expanding thread
up until now.  Allow me to simply suggest a recess? 
Get out and do something other than feed the remarks in this 
discussion for a couple hours.  Or as someone here suggested 
(Alan Cox, I believe): "Go shopping".  
	While it's exciting to get caught up in the moments 
of a discussion like this, the messages here are beginning 
to degrade to the level of "I bite my thumb at you, sir!".  
I'm not pointing fingers around, but I think many of us 
could use a deep breath, some tea or coffee, and a chance
to allow our minds to clear before sending off further 
messages to the list. 
I enjoy a furious discussion, but not when it amounts to 
a lot of finger-pointing, back-scratching, and lip-flapping.
Best regards,
Daniel
