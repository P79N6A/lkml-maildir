The basic problem here is that the "failed hunks" are usually there
because of conflicts between the two patches in question, and as a
result, they are not as easy to merge automagically as one might at
first assume.

I once came across a utility called "diff3" that was designed to take
a patch for one version of a package and create an equivalent patch
for another version of the same package, but I haven't been able to
find it again since my hard drive crashed.
