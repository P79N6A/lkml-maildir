The test was done on 2.4.13, but I looked through 2.4.14, 2.4.15-pre4, and
2.4.13-ac8, and the code in question was not touched.  It is definitely not
just an off-by-one error, since if I try to create a 40TB file it is the same
problem (i.e. llseek returns -EINVAL, dd tries to read 40TB of file to try
and make the file offset correct).  When it would eventually get to the
correct offset (I can't see anything on the read path checking s_maxbytes,
and don't know what LFS says on this) it would just get EFBIG as soon as
it tries to write anything.
An example of what I'm thinking should be changed is (not tested, compiled,
anything yet; EFBIG might be EOVERFLOW, I don't know) just for illustration:
