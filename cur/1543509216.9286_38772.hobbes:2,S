Hi,
How can I make permanent modifications to the MTRRs? For what I see
as soon as the file descriptor associated with /proc/mtrr is closed
all modifications disappear.
Or better yet how can I delete a mtrr register, create two new ones
covering the previous memory range, each with a different access type
and at the end revert everything? 
Something like:
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
start application
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 64MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x04000000 (   64MB), size= 64MB: write-combining, count=1
end application
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
Instead of what I get now:
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
start application
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 64MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x04000000 (   64MB), size= 64MB: write-combining, count=1
end application
no mtrrs set (all the previous ones were created by me and disappeared
when the fd was closed)
Thank you,
Rui Sousa
