Hi,
I've got a question/bug-report for the matrox-fb-driver:
booting with enabled framebuffer via
lilo and command line
video=matrox:vesa:0x114:fh:85kHz,fv=85Hz
works very well. starting an X is possible, but quitting X
leaves the screen blank. My monitor says signal error, horintal 27 kHz,
vertical 42 Hz. This is too less to say, whats going on.
I use kernel version 2.2.2-ac-7 and a matrox mystique
graphics adaptor, but I experienced this in earlier releases, too.
It would be nice, if somebody could give me suggestions, etc.
