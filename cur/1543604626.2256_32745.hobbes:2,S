You are talking about the data; I was talking about the code.
I do not think kernels need the data table, kmalloc'd or statically
built, unless it will be used.  That implies a refcounting scheme.
[WRT "Oops", that is a driver bug, not a case to be considered.  In
Linuxland we do not write code to protect us from rogue code.]
I was pondering whether it was ok to unconditionally include the
lib/crc32.c code, regardless of need.  I am leaning towards "no," which
implies Makefile and Config.in rules which must be updated for each
driver that uses crc32.
