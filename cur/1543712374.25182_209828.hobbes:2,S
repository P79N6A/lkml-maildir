Hi Marcelo,
It's OK here on dual athlon, alpha is compiling. I identified a few
warnings during the compilation. I'll send a few patches to fix them.
The biggest one is on agpgart, when the agp_generic_* functions are
not used, but fixing this needs a lot of #if and I feel like lazy
right now :-)
Regards,
Willy
