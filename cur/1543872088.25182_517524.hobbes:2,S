Sure, if you don't need "input" (only "console logger" function and
not "initial input/output terminal"). It has nothing to do with the
RTS "problem", though.
BTW: reasonably working, standard-compliant USB-RS232 converters
cost $15 or so. Unfortunately not that all machines have USB ports.
I agree with Russell - mixing kernel console and application's
port is asking for trouble.
OTOH I wonder what does the device in question require WRT the
serial port and WRT RTS line in particular.
I know there are some half-duplex converters which drive RTS only
while sending and which require CTS to send. They are perhaps a bit
broken and require some CSMA-alike retransmissions etc.
I don't know if one can expect RTS to stay low all the time. Even
a simple /sbin/setserial from /etc/rc.* would drive it high for
a moment. I'm afraid the only way which makes sense may be using
a customized plug.
