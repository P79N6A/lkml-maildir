The CONFIG_VMSPLIT config options were merged for such cases.
It should be able to split on any 4MB-aligned boundary in
CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G. CONFIG_VMSPLIT_3G_OPT appears to do something of
this sort to use an entire 1GB RAM with minimal user address space
reduction.
This is an ELF ABI violation but the number of major applications
that break is apparently low.
