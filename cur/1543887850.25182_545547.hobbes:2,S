The distros can't update kernels that easily on their stable branches.
And in the userland side, we are not breaking things any further for users
of kernels before 2.6.22 anyway.  Don't expect shutdown(8) to remove support
for <2.6.22 any time soon, at least in Debian.  That will happen only when
we are forced by some other reason to completely break compatibility with
such kernels.

But you have to spin down an USB HD...  el-cheapo USB enclosures will NOT do
it for you.  It is not an easy problem.

Actually, in my limited experience, SAS is marginally less crappy than SATA,
and has a higher MTBF, probably because the manufacturers try to cut less
corners.  But if one can get high-quality SATA drives (where?!), I don't
know why SAS would be superior to SATA.
