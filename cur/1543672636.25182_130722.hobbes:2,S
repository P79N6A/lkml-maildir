Here are some results with a scope hooked to
the hardware while running tests with a regular
interrupt pattern:
2.4.20-8 (redhat)
Latency 20-30usec
Spikes to 80usec
2.5.68
Latency 20-30usec
Spikes to 100usec
2.5.69
Latency 100-110usec (5x increase)
Spikes from 5-10 milliseconds
This is all on a PCI adapter not sharing interrupts
on a dual Pentium II-400 Netserver LC3.
Any ideas what happened?
