2.6.14-rt2 seems to be running fine on my athlon x2 smp system. Apart
from some time warp messages when starting up it looks fine so far (this
is on fc4). 
The same kernel built for fc3 fails to boot in my Sony laptop. I see
this:
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
... then it sits there for some time, no traceback or anything and
then...

This message keeps repeating at regular intervals. Subsequent prints
don't start with the "<3>". 
There could be typos and I ommited beginning addresses to save time,
copied directly from my laptop screen.
