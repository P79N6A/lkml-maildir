Robert's point is well taken.
Only northbridge chips can give us this kind of trouble, and the only
chips mentioned in the present discussion as not being mmconf-compliant
are northbridges (8132, ht1000).
The patch is aware of this, so once a root bus has been programmed for
legacy pci config access, all descendent buses automatically inherit
this access mechanism and are therefore not probed by the patch.
