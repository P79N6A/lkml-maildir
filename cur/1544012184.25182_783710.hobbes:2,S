Are you sure 'current' is dangerous? Perhaps we do not need to worry here, 
since we are testing current against something else, and if the CPU
is just coming on line, it will not be the task we want.

Perhaps just reading the %gs register and see if it faults would be good 
enough?
	long dummy;
	int faulted=0;
	    asm(
		"1:	movq %%gs:0, %0\n"
		"2:
		".section .fixup \"ax\"\n"
		"3:	movl $1, %1\n"
		"	jmp 2b\n"
		".previous"
		_ASM_EXTABLE(1b, 3b)
		: "=r"(dummy), "=r"(faulted)
		: "1"(faulted));
Would this work?  On the good cases, all we do is a read of the %gs 
section, which is the same as doing a smp_process_id(). On the bad case, 
we fault, but we also catch that fact. We are more interested in the good 
case being fast. but I'm not sure how well the start up code could take a 
fault, even when it is expected.
