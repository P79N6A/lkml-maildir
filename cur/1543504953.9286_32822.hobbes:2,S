I believe this may be a more generic bug than 2.3.12: I've seen
klogd run away on my Alpha DS20 several times (100% CPU) running 2.2.10-ac9.
I haven't thought to run vmstat: I'll try the next time it runs away
and see if it is the same symptom there.
The way I've triggered it is to do parallel makes of the Linux
kernel (pretty process intensive: this system has 2 gig of main memory,
so it doesn't hit the disk particularly hard :-) ).
I've rebuilt klogd debug so if I can trigger it again, I may be able
to figure out where it is looping.
In any case, it seems likely that this bug is not just 2.3.12, but
a more generic SMP related problem.
