But many programs are used in system administration in a way that relies on
the almightyness of root, so this is not that clear cut. Lowly ls(1),
rm(1), mv(1), ln(1), your-editor-of-choice(1) come to mind... add stuff
like ifconfig(8), mke2fs(8), and the number is staggering.
One of the very nice things about Unix administration is that you use
mostly the same tools you use as an ordinary user, so it is unlikely that
your skill in using them rusts away from one use to the next. It also
exposes the tools to a much wider audience, so the pressure to fix
infelicities is much larger (and there is more manpower interested in
getting it fixed). This is worth preserving, IMO.
