"bridge" means something completely different in PCI, it's a hub inside a 
PCI domain, literally "bridging" two separate parts of the same domain 
more-or-less seamlessly together. 
A PCI domain, in contrast, is something that is _not_ bridged to another
PCI domain - two PCI domains are disjunct, and do not share any connection
(PCI-wise) to each other.
(Obviously there is some _non_PCI connection, since they are in the same 
box, but that non-PCI connection might be the CPU, or it might be some 
other switching fabric that is not itself visible in the PCI space).
This is why "domain" makes sense - at least to me "domain" is a
independent area as in "I am the master of my domain", correctly implying
that there may be other domains, but that they are separate.
