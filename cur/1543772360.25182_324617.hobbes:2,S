That's because it puts much more stress on the Linux kernel than before.
It's going to take some time to log, audit and fix these issues, but
fixing them after discovery isn't really a big deal as you make it. The
hyperbole where drivers screw with latency is finite. This is a very
managable problem. Again, this a problem for all RTOS system and their
supporting drivers as well since they often come from BSD open source
community.
