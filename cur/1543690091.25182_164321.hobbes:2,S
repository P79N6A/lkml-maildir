Hi
I have just installed the above kernel successfully and generally all good. 
However, the KDE System Monitor is not displaying the correct memory or swap 
usage.
I have 1gig of RAM and over 1gig of Swap space and "top" is correctly 
showing this. However, the monitor is showing 10k of RAM and Swap. This was 
fine in 2.4.20-8.
Not sure whether it's a kenel problem or not, but thought I'd report it.
Cheers
Chris
