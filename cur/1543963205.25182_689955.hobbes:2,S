I don't see how you can avoid taking the system-wide-global lock
before every single anon_vma->lock/i_mmap_lock out there without
mm_lock.
Please note, we can't allow a thread to be in the middle of
zap_page_range while mmu_notifier_register runs.
vmtruncate takes 1 single lock, the i_mmap_lock of the inode. Not more
than one lock and we've to still take the global-system-wide lock
_before_ this single i_mmap_lock and no other lock at all.
Please elaborate, thanks!
