This is wrong. There's the D variable too, the seq lock.
The thing I've in mind is something like:
    rdstcp (get tsc and cpu atomic) this is fundamental without tsc
    and cpu read atomically nothing of the below is possible
    read D from cpu we got from rdtscp (seqlock)
    smb_rmb()
    check that D isn't during the race condition (last LSB clear
    or similar) or restart
    rdstcp again (tsc and cpu atomic)
    check that cpu is still the same or restart
    index the per-cpu array and get the safe A B C
    smp_rmb()
    read per-cpu D again and check that it didn't change or restart
Then you have tsc, A, B and C all atomic. N is a constant. rdtsc again
is fundamental in getting this info all atomic w/o accessing the
southbridge and without expensive asm instruction.

Being scheduled in another core is normal. continuing gettimeofday
from another core after you have the tsc value is just fine.
If something the problem is to generate A B C in per-cpu data with a
per-cpu seqlock around it. That's the job for the per-cpu kernel
thread.
The only real trouble I see is the offset from the last irq. It's
possible to make this to work we need to rotate the timer irq across
all cpus at regular intervals (before the tsc2usec measurement error
showup).

Please don't suggest me the userland rsp manual unwinding, that's
orders of magnitude more fragile and it sounds much more complex too ;).
