What data, if any, did you lose?
While fsck complains loudly when the system comes back up, 9 times in 10
no data is actually lost during a power loss.  e2fsck is really good at
recovering damaged filesystems.

Mount the filesystem synchronously to accomplish this.  It will prevent
the kernel from using a write cache basically.  It will ensure that if a
write operation completes, then the data will be physically on the disk
afterward.

The way to do this is to use a highly reliable filesystem, such as ext3fs,
Tux or ReiserFS.  These filesystems guarantee that metadata is consistent
at all times.

I can't think of a case where the contents of swap matter in any way for
recovering from a power failure.
