The k-d trees only solve the "external" interference case, that is,
it thins the search space by eliminating vma's the page must
necessarily be outside of.
They don't solve the "internal" interference case, where the page does
fall into all of the vma's, but only a few out of those have actually
faulted the page into the pagetables. This is likely only "fixable" by
pointwise methods, which seem to come with notable maintenance expense.
