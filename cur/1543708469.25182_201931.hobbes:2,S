Agreed.  Some magic is needed here.

At mkfs, each block is given IV=HMAC(Key,blockNum).  Every time data is written
to the block, encrypt with IV'=IV+1 and store IV'.
Donno if I like the "if at first we don't succeed, try try again" approach.
But you know better then I do how difficult caching info blocks will be.

Caching sounds like a good way out.  Always consult the cache struct with a
lock for each N-blocks in the FS to reduce bottleneck-ing and let the cache
update at a sensible interval.  ...or am I talking black (block?) magic of the
worst kind here?
How about we set a goal for ourselves saying "we're prepared to accept X
performance degradation for encrypted file systems"?

The "try try again" approach maybe our only way.  Yet, if someone reads data
from the FS and the IV wasn't written to disk yet (or ever in the case of a
crash) then incrementing will not solve anything.  Screwed again.
JLC - will think about this on the bus ride home.
