David,
   You got my vote..... I make simple hardware to improve availability 
of operational systems and i just
can't go to build a native driver because i could not find a kit that 
works.... now i use a perl script to
acomplish this mission... it works greate but is not beaulty as i like 
it to be.... Time is money.....
