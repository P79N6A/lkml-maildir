I don't know the RIGHT answer about the races (quick and dirty answer,
deep doing a rsync until there is nothing to get???)
as far as getting the SCCS format the idea is that someone who uses
bitkeeper pulls a copy from bkbits.net and then makes the SCCS formal
available via the other methods (after I sent you the question above Rik
posted that he is doing this with ftp (for patches) and rsync (full SCCS
format).
