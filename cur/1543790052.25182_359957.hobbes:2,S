  Hello David!
> Code that deals with quotas.
  Is there some documentation how the GFS quotas are supposed to work?
I've just briefly looked through the code and it seems they are quite
similar to the current VFS ones. What are the differences (especially
why don't you implement GFS quotas as just another format of VFS quotas)?
