the switch happens because emacs has higher dynamic priority, as it was
sleeping for the longest time. without these special cases for the
interactive tasks we couldn't use these long timeslices without making
the system not responsive.

I see what you mean, but I still don't think it is a problem. If
bandwidth matters you will have to use large writes and reads anyways,
if bandwidth doesn't matter the number of ctx switches doesn't matter
either and latency usually is way more important with small messages.
you're applying small messages to a "throughput" test, this is why you
have a problem. If you really did interprocess communication (and not a
throughput benchmark) you would probably want the smallest delay in the
delivery of the signal/message.
