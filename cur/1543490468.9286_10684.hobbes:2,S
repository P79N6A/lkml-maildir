It depends entirely on how it gets called, and as you point out, the
original version was just as likely to do the Wrong Thing anyway (making
the buffer B_NODEV as we used to, instead of B_FREE, would mean it would
take a little longer to reuse it, but it could still be reused before IO
completion).  I did have a check before giving the patch the OK to make
sure that it was being called safely everywhere, and ext2/truncate.c
does in fact absolutely guarantee that the buffer has been waited on and
count==1 before calling bforget.
The only other place I can see bforget being used right now is in Ingo's
new raid1/5 check_consistency code, which looks safe, and in the ufs
code, which admittedly looks decidedly dangerous.
However, as it stands, the routine is definitely a loaded gun just
waiting for an opportunity to do serious damage.
It depends on whether you want to make the entry conditions for bforget
explicit, or just do the safe thing and add a few redundant checks which
are guaranteed to be purely cosmetic in the current kernel.  And yes,
things are easier in the future if we just add the test.

Looks fine.  This is essentially precisely what Chuck has been testing
already, it seems, but with the extra check in place.
