This is not a kernel bug.  If you issue a 'halt' when not in run levels
0 or 6 'halt' runs 'shutdown -h'.  That, in turn, does all sorts of nice
things to shutdown your system, including running scripts in 'rc0.d'.
If you want the "power off on halt" behavior you will need to modify the
'halt' script referred to in 'rc0.d' to do a 'halt -p'.
This was driving me nuts for a while too. :-)
