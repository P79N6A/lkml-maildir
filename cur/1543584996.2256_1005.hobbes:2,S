Not if suspend/resume are handled on the fbdev driver level. Dummycon
would only shutdown fbcon on explict open of /dev/fb. Also note it will be
possible to have only a serial console and use /dev/fb by itself. In this
case we don't even need dummycon since their is no VT support present.

See email to Ben.

Yes and it would not be hard to do this. I have the basic idea in the
email to Ben. As for console in text or graphical state take a look at
vt_ioctl.c:vt_ioctl() for KDGETMODE. You get back KD_TEXT or KD_GRAPHICS.
