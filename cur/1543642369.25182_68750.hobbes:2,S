do you mean sack data being sent as a tcp option? 
dont know, lots of other questions arise (like timestamp
on all the segments would be the same?).

most recent (dont know how far back) versions of netstat
display /proc/net/snmp and /proc/net/netstat (with the 
Linux TCP MIB), so netstat -s should show you most of 
whats interesting. Or were you referring to something else?
ifconfig -a and netstat -rn would also be nice to have..
thanks,
