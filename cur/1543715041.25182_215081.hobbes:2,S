I just verified that the Quad Ethernet board works with 2.6.5 SMP, so it
is unlikely to be a bridge or other hardware problem.
For 2.4.26, the Dell 650 has an Intel 82545EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller
soldered in, which also uses the e1000 driver, and that works fine, so
we know the 2.4.26 e1000 driver works with some of these Intel chips.
When the Quad board works, it negotiates down to 10 MBits/sec Half Duplex.
Not sure yet if this is what it is supposed to be doing in our environment.

Joe
PS: do you CC'ed Intel guys have some insights or data for us?
