Sugarwater probably works (when it actually does work) because
sugar is a mild digestive alkalizer. The real problem is
likely to be acid indigestion in that case, and one should burp
the child afterwards (what do acids and alkalis produce in combination?).
At 1 month, the child may be still breast-feeding, so there isn't
a lot else one can do in that case. Food high in natural digestive enzymes
is probably also too high in other bizarrely exotic molecules for a very
young infant's digestive track.
It may be just gas, a burp might do it.
After the child is off of breast milk, goat's milk is an easier to 
digest alternative to cow's milk if you have it available, if it is
affordable, and if it is packaged as hygeinically as cow's milk
(pastuerized). I suppose in the US most people just use a
physician-recommended formula milk substitute for children having trouble
digesting cow's milk, but I don't know high wide-spread the availability
of such products is internationally and how different brands compare
in quality of ingredients.
Note: the goats should not have access to beer or fermenting potatos on a
regular basis.
