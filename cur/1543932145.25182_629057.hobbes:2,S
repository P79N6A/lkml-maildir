  I think yes. 0 swappiness doesn't mean "no swapping at all". From the
code in shrink_active_list() it seems that it just decreases likeliness
of removing pages of mmaped files (i.e., also executables loaded in memory).

  Yes, that's quite unpleasant. How much memory do you have? If you have
some time, you can try playing with the code in mm/vmscan.c to find out
what's happening in your case (putting some debugging output in
shrink_active_list() etc...

  Currently, I'm not aware of any way...
