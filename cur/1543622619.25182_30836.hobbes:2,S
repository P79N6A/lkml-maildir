Recent versions of cryptoapi do 512 byte IV as do all versions of loop-AES
(maintained by me, 
http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/
). If you want to keep
using 2.2 kernels or want to use distro vendor kernels, loop-AES is better
choice as it works with all kernels and has more up to date loop fixes than
cryptoapi.
