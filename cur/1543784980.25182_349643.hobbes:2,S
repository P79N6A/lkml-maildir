You do not need an "i" representation in SCSI Core. In fact,
the "i" does exist, but it is _transport_ specific, e.g. Id in SPI,
or WWN in SAS.
SCSI Core can work without ever representing "i".
The IEEE1394 people have also pointed that out to you recently.

The "L" you need to represent at face value: 64 bits, no interpretations
of any kind, BE order.
Once you do that you need not worry about it, ever.

Don't rush to agree.
Read my reply where I explain that SAS is _not_ Ethernet,
half way down:

Enumeration is wrong!  I know you want to stick to Parallel SCSI,
but enumeration is wrong.
You do not know what the domain is or looks like at SCSI Core level,
and to impose enumeration is simply wrong.
You need not an "i" part at all to make SCSI Core work.  A pointer
to scsi_domain_device (yet to be created) is enough.

And a SAS domain is not a _true_ network, although very similar.
Trust me, showing the domain in sysfs naturally, does _not_ hurt
anyone.
It is simply part of evolution: The storage transport layer owns
it and controls it, SCSI Core is unaware of it due to layering
set forth in SAM and SPC (SAS too).
I've posted references to the figures and text before:
- SAM4r02, Figure 2 to Figure 8 are very good -- a picture is worth
more than a 1000 words.
- SPC4r00, Figure 1 -- very descriptive.
- SAS1r09e, Figure 1, (Figure 2 for ATA),
  Figure 10 -- very descriptive in showing what SCSI Core should
  be (yellow part) and what transport layer should be (green part).

Yes, that's a good assumption to take.
