Hello,
I would like to announce the latest 2.6.4 kernel release for 
the Renesas M32R processor.
In this release, MMU-less targets such as M32102 microcontrollers are
newly supported, and an OAKS32R, a tiny and inexpensive board, is newly
supported as a Linux/M32R embedded platform.
Patch information to the stock linux-2.6.4 kernel is placed as follows:
- m32r architecture dependent portions (arch/m32r, include/asm-m32r)
  
http://www.linux-m32r.org/public/linux-2.6.4_m32r_20040406.arch-m32r.patch
- architecture independent portions for the m32r
  
http://www.linux-m32r.org/public/linux-2.6.4_m32r_20040406.patch
We are now packaging other noMMU support stuffs for the M32R processor; 
library(uClibc) and cross tools (m32r-elf GNU tools and elf2flt
utility) and so on. 
I hope we can also release them via our homepage soon.
Regards,
