Agreed, when the controller sets the FGR bit, it
starts sending the resume signal to all ports,
waking attached devices, which will send back
valid resume signals to the host controller, which
will complete the wakeup. Which takes us back
to the thrashing problem.
For the case where ports are not hardwired to OC,
we should account for the possibility that the
OC condition may clear (bad cable replaced, etc).
So if we allow suspend, and then ignore resumes
on an OC (temporary condition) port, then that port will not
be able to cause a valid resume when the OC
condition is cleared. (per port RD is already set)
So always allowing suspend, and selectively doing the
wakeup will cause:
1. thrashing for case of one port OC,
other port OK with attached device.
2. prevent port with OC from doing resume
after clearing OC condition.
For the case of all ports hardwired OC, this
will work because you suspend the whole controller
and never get a valid resume.
