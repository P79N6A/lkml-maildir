It basically does the same as iget, just that they split the downcall
to the fs and the vnode get (iget). Linux nfsfh.c is nothing at all like iget!

I have a similar patch (funny isn't it?), because it is required for reiserfs.
reiserfs needs at least 64bits to find a file again. It was cleaner to 
move it out.  
Unfortunately it still stinks, NFS deals very poorly with path dependent 
file handles.
With the current requirement to always require a path for VFS operations
I see no way to ever build an as robust Linux based NFSv2,NFSv3 server
as BSD/Solaris have. Sad but true.
[NFSv4 has volatile file handles that require the client to store the 
path and relookup when needed, but of course the 
end result will be even farther away from POSIX semantics as current NFS
is already]

For traditional unix file systems like NFS it is very hard to rebuild a 
path using a key (it is always very costly and usually breaks when the
directory tree changes inbetween)

The inode is just a key. To make the key usable for stateless fs like nfs
you need to make the key a cookie that is valid over reboots. Now that "key"
is traditionally the inode number in unix file systems. In reiserfs it 
is a aggregate of object id, directory id and possible offset. The only
reason to stay with a 32bit "key" for ino_t is user space compatibility,
but in kernel it should be really an arbitary length byte buffer (in
practice the key is limited by the NFS spec and it makes sense to keep
a static limit to avoid dynamic memory management) 
I guess you agree with me on that ?
If we can meet at a open_by_key() function everything would be ok.
[
In 2.1 space I had a proposal (+patches) for "virtual hardlinks" that
generated dentries from inums by just creating new hidden names for 
them that only existed in the dcache. Unfortunately it was rejected :/
]
For the reiserfs work I added the following extensions to VFS.
To super_operations: 
        struct dentry *(*build_dentry)(struct super_block *,__u8 *key,int keylen
To inode operations: 
        int (*getkey) (struct dentry *, __u8 *key, int keylen);
I guess your approach is similar ?  It probably would make sense to merge
our proposals early. If yours handles the reiserfs case cleanly (64bit 
keys) I would be happy to switch.
The problem the reiserfs implementation has is that it still deals very poorly
with file system tree changes (it inherited that from the nfsfh algorithm). 
It is basically not a really robust solution, more a very elaborate hack :/
