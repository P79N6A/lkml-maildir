Greetings!  So what's the status on this issue?  Are we at the stage
yet where a simple patch containing only this fix can go somewhere
like on www.uk.linux.org's errata page?  There's a whole lot of other
stuff in the .13pre that I really would not like to experiment with
yet. My apologies if this has already appeared somewhere.
take care,
