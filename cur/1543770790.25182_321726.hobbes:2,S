Nope. There's a pty in between, and the pty buffer is much bigger than 
just a few lines, so even if an xterm is hung, the program displaing on an 
xterm wouldn't be affected normally (unless it reads from the tty or 
outputs several kB of data).
So it's either a kernel scheduling problem, or Crossover running with RT 
priority and screwing up.
