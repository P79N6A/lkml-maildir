no, we are trading _both_ accuracy and speed here! a global 'likeliness' 
pointer for commonly executed codepaths is causing global cacheline 
ping-pongs - which is as bad as it gets.
the right approach, which incidentally would also be perfectly accurate, 
is to store an alloc_percpu()-ed pointer at the call site, not the 
counter itself.
the current code needs more work before it can go upstream i think.
