Same here on 2.4.1 smp with two dirt-cheap ne2pci-clones. System
unusuable (as stated by clem ealier today) and need for
reboot. Nothing special happened on the box before.
Other message in that context:
Mar 21 18:28:58 maniac kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
Mar 21 18:28:58 maniac kernel: eth1: Tx timed out, lost interrupt?
TSR=0x3, ISR=0x3, t=27.
Fortunately, SysRq-S-U-B works...
