Al,
I happen to be learning how to cross-compile on Debian right now, so i can 
testify that building the cross toolchain 'The Debian Way' is even easier 
than you describe ;).

The package toolchain-source (together with dpkg-cross) makes the process even 
more automatic. Detailed instructions are at:
http://people.debian.org/~debacle/cross.html
The short story is:
# apt-get toolchain-source dpkg-cross autoconf2.13 fakeroot
# tpkg-install-libc <terget>-linux # grabs, converts and install the headers
$ tpkg-make <target>-linux  # no need to patch anything
$ cd binutils...
$ debuild -us -uc    # no magic env variables
# dpkg -i ../binutils...deb
$ cd ../gcc...
$ debuild -us -uc
# dpkg -i ../gcc...deb
If I'm not mistaken, that's all.

Sadly right! guess which platform I needed to cross compile :-/
Cheers,
