I *do* still use 2.95 a lot, and I'm not alone, judging from people
around me. 2.95 has been the reference for a very long time, that's
why it's still so much present. 3.0 and 3.1 (even 3.2) have been
there for a very short time frame, but 2.95 and 3.3 really seem to
be references compilers.
So please keep support for 2.95.
Cheers,
Willy
