Can I mount a friendly challenge to that idea?
The reason being, I've got a DVD writer that supports DVD-RAM, and 
because I was curious I bought one.  The media is *hard sectored*.  That 
is, you look at the underneath and you see a series of concentric dots, 
each the same angular distance from each other.  I had presumed that 
these are to give the drive something big to key its read/write 
operations on.  Nice, except I don't think the media is compatible with 
a regular DVD drive.
DVD+RW, on the other hand, I just thought was a different surface 
technology (more expensive, higher quality) than DVD-RW.  There is 
nothing to help with the lead-in/lead-out problem that is why you have 
several megabytes of lead-in and lead-out per session on a multi-session 
disc.
But maybe I'm wrong here... if I could use a DVD+RW like a DVD-RAM I'd 
be very happy indeed.
Sam.
