The main reason for removing the NexGen support was that the latter
had effectively been broken for G-d knows how many years. As a person
somehow involved into embedded development, I simply could not resist
to trim a few dozen bytes of dead binary code off vmlinux. Besides,
the change is trivially revertable (just checked that), and in case
that somebody owns a NexGen box and complains, that can be addressed
in a matter of minutes.
