I syspect the biggest problem you will run into is that you have no way of
knowing when memory is allocated whether or not the memory needs to be
accessed from the kernel. If the memory is used by the program with no
system calls you can allocate it anywhere, but if memory is allocated,
used, and then later used as a output buffer for example, the data would
first need to be copied from the non-kernel accessable space to the kernel
accessable space then output. As this copy would have to be done by the
program it would break many (if not most) of the software that is out
there.
This added memory would also be of limited use becouse very few programs
need large amounts of memory that are not used (at some point) for input
or output.

make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
