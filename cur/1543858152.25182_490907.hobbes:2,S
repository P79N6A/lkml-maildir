The system I see these problems on is a Suse 10.0.  I STORE RPM's on a 
Reiser FS system on this server as an ftp server.  It's the server at 
ftp.soleranetworks.com.  I run 2.6.18 and 2.6.19 for our development at 
present for our appliances, we do not ship Suse.  Our appliances use 
RedHat ES4 and FC6.  We were testing Suse out as an FTP server -- its 
not very stable.  The Suse system with ReiserFS is running 2.6.13.
