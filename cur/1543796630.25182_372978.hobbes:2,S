The problem with this approach is the tiny size of the minority of customers 
using ATI's video cards on a non-Windows OS.
I think the only way we can persuade vendors to not take the direction that 
Arjan speculates they will, is to increase the Linux userbase (and therefore 
ATI customers using Linux) by making "Desktop Linux" increasingly competent.
As easy as it is to be pessimistic about binary vendor lockin, there's still 
places in industry, government and inevitably the general public where Linux 
is slowly starting to take off as a real desktop alternative to Windows.
When this happens, vendors will just have to solve all the IP nonsense 
associated with their hardware, or design hardware to be more dependent on 
firmware so that largely open source drivers are more feasible for them.
