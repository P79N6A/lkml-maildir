[taking this to the lists, to keep anyone who cares about this in the loop]
This conversation evolved out of my split-agpgart-device-list patch.
Linus' proposal is to take this a step further and split each of
the chipsets into a seperate module.  I'm about to tackle this,
but in case there's some hidden gotchas that myself and Linus have
overlooked, I figured I'd give a 'heads up'.
Any comments?
		Dave.
