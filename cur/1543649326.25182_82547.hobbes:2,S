Rob, are you happy with the distinction between dprobes and kprobes? We are
not proposing dprobes for 2.5 but rather kprobes + as many of the
incremental patches that Vamsi posted earlier. Altogether these amount to
the same thing as dprobes. All of these patches will be available from our
website.
If on the other hand, if  Linus wishes to integrate dprobes then we shan't
be disappointed :-)
