Subject: [PATCH] linux/mount.h: add atomic.h and spinlock.h #includes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'm not sure what the current policy is on include files being
self-sufficient, so feel free to drop this if we don't want to do this
sort of cleanup...
<linux/mount.h> uses atomic_t and spinlock_t, but doesn't include
either <asm/atomic.h> or <linux/spinlock.h>, which means that any
users of <linux/mount.h> have to include them.  This patch adds the
necessary #includes to avoid this.
