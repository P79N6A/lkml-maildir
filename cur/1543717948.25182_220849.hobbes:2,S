Maybe my math is completely off, but with slab you'd need a page at least,
the kmem_cache_t and maybe a kmem_bufctl_t
So for the usual two or three queue desktops we went from 1024 or 1536
to 4096 + N.
Cutoff point is at aproximately 9 queues which I think most machines running
linux won't reach.
Anyway, not that this is really important, I think we just need to question
all this silent bloating a little..
