Hi!!
        Tonight, I found that doing a kill -9 -1 as a normal user kills root
processes in 2.2.3ac1.
        I talked with other person and he had the same results with 2.2.3
plain.
        I don't have time to test it with older versions to see if they are
vulnerable too.
Regards,
        Nuno Loureiro
