Hi Petr,
The patch you posted for the MPT Fusion driver regression with VMware 
5.5.4 (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/23/345
) was used to fix a Gentoo 
kernel bug (
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185272
).
Have you received word from upstream (kernel devs) yet as to whether 
your patch will be included? Or if it will be included at all?
Regards,
Maarten Bressers
