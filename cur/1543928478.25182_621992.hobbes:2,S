Subject: [PATCH] kconfig: Make KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG work with randconfig.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/28/94

Adrian mentioned a few weeks ago that KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG is the way to
go to ensure that things like allyes/allmod/allnoconfig work with a
constrained set of symbols, with the implication that this holds
true for randconfig as well.
While allyes/mod/noconfigs do seem to work fine with KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG
provisions, randconfig tramples all over the provided values at perhaps
not surprisingly, random.
Debugging this a bit, there seemed to be two issues:
	- SYMBOL_DEF and SYMBOL_DEF_USER overlap, which made
	  def_sym->flags the same regardless of whether we came from an
	  KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG path or not.
	- clobbering of the fixed value in conf_choice() by way of
	  random() def assignment.
While I don't pretend to have any idea what I'm doing in Kconfig,
changing SYMBOL_DEF_USER to reuse the SYMBOL_DEF3 bit (and thereby
separating it from SYMBOL_DEF) in addition to checking the def_sym flag
before randomly assigning a new value ended up fixing things up.
