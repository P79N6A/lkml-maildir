I would not say it is not "the nicest thing", it is just not necessary
to do the reference counting.  But we want the ref counting for other
reasons, so it seems sensible.

Seems silly to dynamically create something that we know a priori we
only have one of.  E.g., why dynamically create something that is not
dynamic.
But it is not a big deal.  If this is some rule of yours, I can
kmalloc() the device_driver structure and kfree() it in my release()
function.  Is that what you want?

But device release == module unload.
I am not following, sadly.

The module reference counting is fine.
The count is elevated while one of the sysfs files is open, decremented
when it closes.
