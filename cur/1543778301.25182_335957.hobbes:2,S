It looks like John's version is actually based on a previous revision
of this driver. 8/

Err, why should my assabet touchscreen be called "collie_ts" ?
collie is just a platform which happens to use it - it's got
no relevance to the driver naming at all.

That doesn't make sense when you have other non-SA1100 devices using
mcp-core.c.  Whether that happens or not I've no idea - I can't see
what everyone's using out there (just like I've absolutely zero
idea what collie folk are doing or not doing.)

arch/arm/soc?  That means that (a) we end up with another directory to
accumulate crap, (b) it's not a SoC so doesn't belong in a directory
named as such, (c) it means that the MCP and UCB drivers get their
individual files scattered throughout the kernel tree, one in this
directory, one in that directory, one in another random directory.
That's far from ideal.
Anyway, summarising this, the results are that what we have here is
a complete and utter mess. ;(
So, if the collie folk would like to clean their changes up and send
them to me as the driver author, I'll see about integrating them into
my version and we'll take it from there.
