Exactly my point!  The complexity of SLAB keeps it at the "I could not do
it better myself" catagory.  This wasn't suppose to be a bash, it was
actually a complement.  But things in the "I could not do it better
myself" catagory are usually very hard to modify.  Because, unless you are
at the level of genius of those that wrote it, you may easily break it.
Or put it to a level of "Ha, I can do this better".

I perfectly agree with this statement.  As I mentioned earlier, it may
have been different if I was a part of the changes that were made.  But I
wasn't, and that leaves me the task to figure out why things were done the
way they were done.  Before changes can be made, one must have a full
understanding of why things exist as it does.
Don't get me wrong, my comments are more of a frustration with myself that
I'm having trouble understanding all that's in SLAB.  I understand the
SLAB concept, but I'm having trouble with understanding the current
implementation.  That's _my_ problem.  But I will continue to work at it,
and maybe I will be able to produce some clean up patches once I do
understand.

I like the SLOB code, because it was simple enough for my mortal mind.  I
actually started to play with it to get a better understanding of the way
the SLAB works.  It has actually helped in that catagory.
