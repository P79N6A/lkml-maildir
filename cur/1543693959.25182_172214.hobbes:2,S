Correct me if I'm wrong, but I vaguely remember back at the end of 1998 the 
big "let's ship 2.2" push crescendoed towards the end of the year after two 
and a half years of development, there was the big push to ship it by 
christmas, then by new years, and after missing both deadlines it shipped a 
dot-zero release in january 1999, followed shortly thereafter by a "brown 
paper bag" bugfix release.
The big "let's ship 2.4" push crescendoed towards the end of 2000,  after 
about two and a half years of development (give or take the 2.2 stabilization 
period before 2.3 forked off), there was a big push to ship it by christmas, 
then by new years, and after missing both deadlines it shipped a dot-zero at 
the start of january 2001, followed by the brown paper bag...
It's now coming up on two and a half years of development towards 2.6.  It's 
getting towards the end of the year.  (I take Linus is aiming to have the 2.6 
release out by this christmas? ;)
Does this seem kind of familiar to anyone else...?

(I don't remember if 2.1 had a new feature freeze a year or so before the 
final code freeze the way 2.3 and 2.5 did, but it does seem we've got a 
pattern going here.  But then I'm sleep-deprived right now, and could easily 
be imagining it...)
