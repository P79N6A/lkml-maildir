I agree it is strange to have the DRM code in drivers/char. It should be
in drivers/video. I guess in time. As for DRI and FB sharing code. You
will see this happen more and more in the future. Eventually I like to
merge both interfaces into one universal interface, but before I do that
the whole fbdev layer needs to be cleaned up which I'm doing now.
