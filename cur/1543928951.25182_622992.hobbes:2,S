Well, it is
- 4G UMTS PPP networking hardware
- PCMCIA
- which presents itself as a serial character device (i.e. looks like 
  usual modem to userspace, accepts AT commands, etc)
So my opinion is that it's very far away from what actually is in 
drivers/net/wireless. It's not 802.x network card in any sense.
