The only way to fix that with TCP is to pull the plug.  You probably didn't
understand it, but the RST is only *one* way where TCP replies, but there
are lots of other ways too (like ACKs)

If you think you don't want such "weakness"es you should probably look
for a different protocol than TCP. I don't know any that would fix it.
The funny thing is that IPSec et.all.  don't help here at all.

This implies that the incoming flood is at least as fast as your outgoing
connection (TCP will never send more than a single packet in response
to an input packet, so the attacker can never eat more outgoing bandwidth
than incoming) 
One simple workaround (it is not a real fix, because a real fix is not
possible) would be to limit the total bandwidth the irc servers can
send/receive upstream to a fraction of your full line.

Just don't let the attackers know, it is a wonderfull DoS against anybody
