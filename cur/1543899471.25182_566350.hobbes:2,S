IMO we should start by using the new notifier chain and by implementing 
a central "icebox" routine.  Then we can forbid device registration 
during suspend.
It might also be a good idea to add a freezable keventd-like workqueue 
specifically intended for things that need to block during a suspend.  
Although maybe this will end up being unnecessary; it's too soon to 
tell.
