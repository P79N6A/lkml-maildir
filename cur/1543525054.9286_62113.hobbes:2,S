Subject: [bug tracking hint] ramdisk bug in 2.3.42
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I tried the ramdisk driver on a 2.3.42 kernel and found out that it was
still broken (it has been for some time now). I wrote a test program
that makes writes/reads/verifies on the raw /dev/ram0 device and saw
that it was OK from userspace. The problem seems to be related to the
vfs layer, as I am unable to mount a mkfs'ed ramdisk (whatever the fs
type, minix or ext2). In drivers/block/rd.c (function rd_request, line
250), I changed
	sbh = CURRENT->bh;
	rbh = get_hash_table(sbh->b_dev, sbh->b_blocknr, sbh->b_size);
	if (sbh == rbh) {
		if (CURRENT->cmd == READ)
				memset(CURRENT->buffer, 1, len);
	} else if (rbh) {
to
	sbh = CURRENT->bh;
	rbh = get_hash_table(sbh->b_dev, sbh->b_blocknr, sbh->b_size);
	if (sbh == rbh) {
		if (CURRENT->cmd == READ) {
				printk("1");
				memset(CURRENT->buffer, 1, len);
		}
	} else if (rbh) {
and got the following error while mounting a minix formatted ramdisk
(note the "11") :
11VFS: Can't find a Minix or Minix V2 filesystem on device 01:01.
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/ram1,
       or too many mounted file systems
So I tried to change the abovementioned code to
	sbh = CURRENT->bh;
	rbh = get_hash_table(sbh->b_dev, sbh->b_blocknr, sbh->b_size);
	if (sbh == rbh) {
		if (CURRENT->cmd == READ) {
			if (rbh)
				memcpy(CURRENT->buffer, rbh->b_data, rbh->b_size);
			else
				memset(CURRENT->buffer, 1, len);
		}
	} else if (rbh) {
and now I am able to mount my ramdisk and it _apparently_ works.
IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------
I did not post this as a patch, as it is not a fix but just a hack, so
use it at your own risk !!!
I really know _nothing_ to ramdisk, VFS, the buffer cache and the page
cache. I post in the hope that it will help someone who knows these
parts of the kernel to locate the bug and fix it properly.
