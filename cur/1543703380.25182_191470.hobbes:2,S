Drat ;).  Perhaps Andrew will elaborate on his "gad", and I will have
some clue of whether it is worth responding with another variant.
Clearly something in my last patch looked ugly to him.

This wasn't an option before, in my variations that didn't zero-fill each
chunk.  But with your zero-fill, which I agree is better, this is possible.
Not a bad idea.  Another instance of Postel's Prescription:
   Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.

Though possibly a violation of the Rule of Composition:
   Design programs to be connected to other programs.
If commas are optional on input, then a user level program that
generates such masks could not always feed them to another user level
program that reads them.  The reader might require exact comma placement
that the producer didn't provide.
Since the primary "documentation" for this format will be what is
displayed when someone does "cat /proc/irq/prof_cpu_mask", I rather
think that the design format should be exactly what displays here,
including exact comma separation, both displaying and parsing.

Purely philosophical, as best as I can tell.  All the other bitmask
stuff works on objects that are some number of words in size.  I see no
use whatsoever for this additional complexity.
Unless you can show me a need for this, I think it is overdesign.

Huh?  I am unware that my code displays differently depending on whether
the underling "unsigned long" is 4 or 8 bytes.
