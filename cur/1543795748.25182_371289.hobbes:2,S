Subject: Fix crash when ptrace poking hugepage areas

Bill, does this look like the correct fix for the problem to you?  If
so, please apply Andrew.
set_page_dirty() will not cope with being handed a page * which is
part of a compound page, but not the master page in that compound
page.  This case can occur via access_process_vm() if you attempt to
write to another process's hugepage memory area using ptrace()
(causing an oops or hang).
This patch fixes the bug by first resolving the page * to the compound
page's master page.
