Hi!
I've noticed that pppd (2.3.5) fails to remove the proxy ARP entry
after the link goes down:
Mar 14 10:05:22 zeus pppd[1898]: ioctl(SIOCDARP): No such file or
directory(2)
If I run arp I see how the proxy ARP entries are always in the ARP
cache:
zeus:~$ /usr/sbin/arp
Address                 HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask Iface
[...]
130.151.17.163          *       *                   MP         eth0
This host is always a remote PPP client. Right now it is not connected
but it has an entry in the ARP cache.
I guess this is a bug in pppd. Does anyone know of a fix for this?
Thanks!
