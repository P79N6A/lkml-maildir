Thanks, then we at least know it's a gcc bug. It's sometimes hard to
tell what features are actually supposed to work, especially the stuff
that's only documented in the internals manual...
Anyway, "o" is apparently more correct than "m" since with "o" it
manages to compile all the filesystems without complaining, and the
output looks correct. On the other hand, ocfs2 probably isn't
something you want to use on your AVR32 board...
