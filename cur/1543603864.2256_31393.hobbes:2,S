Hi
 PCI stopped working after upgrading kernel from redhat 2.4.3 to 2.4.10,
ISA devices are fine. Here are dmesg output fragments:
redhat 2.4.3-12:
PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xfd6f2, last bus=0
PCI: Using configuration type 2
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
also lspci output of pci hardware:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 82434LX [Mercury/Neptune] (rev 11)
        Flags: bus master, slow devsel, latency 32
But using 2.4.10:
PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xfd6f2, last bus=0
PCI: System does not support PCI
Any hope getting PCI bus working on this box? Maybe some hints? Thanx :)
