Hi,
I am experiencing rather strange problems with the 2.2 kernel.
Basically, on this system, (which has an i486 w/ pentium overdrive
processor - although this is probably irrelevent), pppd under 2.0 and 2.4
works fine. However, on 2.2, during disk access or general strain on the ISA
bus, ppp drops packets - either as errors or frame errors. Also, I
occaisonally see VJ decompression errors in the logfiles.
The distribution I'm using is Slackware 8.0, which utilises pppd 2.4.1.
I am unsure what other information to supply, although the following could
be relevant;
bootlog, (under 2.4.14)
ide: Assuming 50MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
If anyone could help in any way, it would be greatly appreciated.
