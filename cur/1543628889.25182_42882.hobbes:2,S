All fine and all will be taken. However please note that
I don't use BK and I don't intend too. My rejection of
it isn't based on any idiotic policy - I found it just ugly to
use and I was confused about the beta-alpha versions
offered on the web site - too much work in progress for my taste.
Finally I don't entrust source code to programmers who even don't know
the difference between TCP and UDP and use TCP becouse they don't know better.
I preferr a classical diff -urN ;-).
