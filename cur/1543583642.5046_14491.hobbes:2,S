Ok.

This is precisely what the "next MMAP is XXX space" ioctl I've
suggested is for.  I think I've addressed this concern in my
proposal already.  Look:
	fd = open("/proc/bus/pci/${BUS}/${DEV}", ...);
	if (fd < 0)
		return -errno;
	err = ioctl(fd, PCI_MMAP_IO, 0);
	if (err < 0) {
		close(fd);
		return -errno;
	}
	ptr = mmap(NULL, pdev->bar[3].size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
		   MAP_PRIVATE, fd, pdev->bar[3].start);
Something like that.

No, don't do this, it is evil.  Use mappings, specify the device
related info somehow when creating the mapping (in the userspace
variant you do this by openning a specific device to mmap, in the
kernel variant you can encode the bus/dev/etc. info in the device's
resource and decode this at ioremap() time, see?).
