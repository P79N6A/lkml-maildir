Right.

Why do you disagree, since
 - right now PA-RISC is BUGGY because of the lack of volatile. gcc _does_ 
   optimize and combine accesses since it's an inline function _without_
   any volatile specifier on the pointers.
 - the volatile _documents_ the fact that the bitops have volatile 
   behaviour.

It seems the pa-risc optimizer for gcc is somehow broken. I just checked 
on x86:
	#define test_bit(x,y) \
	        (!!((1ul << x) & *(y)))
	int test(unsigned long *a)
	{
	        while (test_bit(0, a));
	}
definitely does not re-load the value. I checked with an inline function 
too, same result:
	        testb   $1, (%eax)
	        .p2align 2,,3
	.L2:
	        jne     .L2
ie gcc _does_ optimize this away without the volatile. With the volatile 
it turns into
	        .p2align 2,,3
	.L2:
	        movl    (%edx), %eax
	        testb   $1, %al
	        jne     .L2
so there's a clear difference here.
Now, why gcc on pa-risc misses that optimization, I have no clue.

That's apparently just you being lucky due to having a broken gcc.
