We definitely are. MacOS uses EFI. Linux (if you want to use a standard 
Linux distro image) uses Boot Camp, aka BIOS emulation.

Is there _ever_ any valid reason to clear it? I wouldn't object at all to 
a patch that just forces it..
That said, I could imagine some strange AML sequence that clears that bit 
in order to do something really nasty (and then sets it again at the end). 
There's no limit to what horrors can lurk in peoples BIOSes.
