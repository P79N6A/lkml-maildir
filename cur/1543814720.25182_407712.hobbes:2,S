Subject: [PATCH 16/21] Kconfig: swap VIDEO_CX88_ALSA and VIDEO_CX88_DVB

VIDEO_CX88_ALSA should not be between
VIDEO_CX88_DVB and VIDEO_CX88_DVB_ALL_FRONTENDS
When cx88-alsa was added to cx88/Kconfig, it was
added in between VIDEO_CX88_DVB and
VIDEO_CX88_DVB_ALL_FRONTENDS.  This caused
undesireable effects to the appearance of the menu
options in menuconfig.
This fix reorders cx88-alsa and cx88-dvb in Kconfig,
to match saa7134, and restore the correct menuconfig
appearance.
