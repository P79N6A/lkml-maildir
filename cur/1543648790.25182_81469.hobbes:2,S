But that's what her patch infrastructure seems to do. It's not just
epoll_create(), it's all the other ioctl's too (unlink, remove etc). One
queston is whether there is one epoll system call (that multiplexes, like
in Hanna's patch) or many. I personally don't like multiplexing system
calls - the system call number _is_ a multiplexor, I don't see the point 
of having multiple levels.
