I did try this once by having a 'supervisor' process ptrace every
resumed process and translate PIDs inside system calls, but this got
very messy very fast - particularly for terminal ioctls.
Additionally, it means parents can't get notification of when their
children die, and it makes the whole show just that much slower.
Getting them back their original PIDs seems like less effort (so
long as they're available).  I'm probably shouldn't admit to what
I'm currently doing - editing last_pid through /dev/kmem, to force
the next pid fork() returns. (Unbelievably racy, but works as a
temporary measure).
Bernard.
