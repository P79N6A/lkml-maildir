Hey,
That makes sense. I no longer have access to an s390 system so I will
not be able to provide a tested patch for this bug. I will however
attempt to fix this issue and submit a patch using the scheduled
callback function and maybe someone could make sure that it works properly.
Have a good one,
Igor H.
