I think ext4dev made more sense for ext4 because people generally expect
ext* to be stable.  Btrfs doesn't quite have the reputation for
stability yet, so I don't feel we need a special -dev name for it.
But, if Andrew/Linus prefer that unstable filesystems are tagged with
-dev, I'm happy to do it.
