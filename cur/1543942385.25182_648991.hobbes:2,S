note that there are ways to stage even API extensions like adding an 
extra 'struct mm_struct *mm' to macros. It takes a temporary ugliness 
like:
 #define __EXTRA_MM_ARG_DEF			, struct mm_struct *mm
 #define __EXTRA_MM_ARG_VAL(arg)		, (arg)
which converted architectures redefine.
and at the end eliminate these compatibility macros from the core, once 
all arches have converted.
so we _could_ stage even something like this.
