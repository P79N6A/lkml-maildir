Seeing as I didn't notice this patchest changed XFS (where's the cc?)
until I saw hch's question I'd appreciate a pointer to that discussion
as it's long been deleted from my mailbox.
FWIW, I happen to agree with Christoph (hch) that the shouting
macros are an ugly step backwards, esp. given that is replacing:
#define per_cpu_ptr(ptr, cpu)   percpu_ptr((ptr), (cpu))
a set of lowercase macros....
Cheers,
Dave.
