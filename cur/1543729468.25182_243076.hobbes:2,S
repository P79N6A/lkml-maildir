Subject: [PATCH] ppc64: Fix v_regs pointer setup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/18/98

During some signal test, we found that v_regs pointer was not setup correctly.
v_regs was made to point to itself, as a result of which the pointer was
corrupted when vec registers were copied over. When the signal handler
returned, restore_sigcontext tried derefering the invalid pointer and in
the process killed the app with SIGSEGV.
Following patch should fix it. Please review and apply:
