Placing useful information in the task struct is a hack.  A useful
hack on the register-starved x86, of course.  PPC64 will probably use
a register, too.
BTW, apologies for my previous accusations of not reading the
thread. Your reply predated mine by 12 hours:

My first cut did this, with a macro:
DECLARE_PER_CPU(int x);
This allows you to munge x into x__per_cpu, to catch "bare"
references.  But I decided against it for two reasons: firstly
__per_cpu_data is nicer, and secondly my proc/sys rewrite can handle
per-cpu data easily if the name is valid.
In practice, grep should be sufficient.
Cheers!
Rusty.
