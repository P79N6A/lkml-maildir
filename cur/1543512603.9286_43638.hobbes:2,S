This is the core of the loadavg computation function:
for_each_task(p) {
		if ((p->state == TASK_RUNNING ||
		     (p->state & TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE) ||
		     (p->state & TASK_SWAPPING)))
			nr += FIXED_1;
}
TASK_UNINTERRUPIBLE looks like a good candidate. So please check with
ps which process is always in state 'D' and where it hangs (with ps
lax in WCHAN)
