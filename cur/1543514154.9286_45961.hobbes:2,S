It should. The Mxxx are intentionally upwards compatibile. If you compile
for M386 it doesn't mean that you want to run such kernel only on a 386
but it means you want to run in on any imachine >= 386. Then when you
enable the SMP support you'll allow the kernel to run SMP. They are
orthogonal issues. So if you want a kernel binary which runs on both a 386
and it runs SMP with a P6-SMP you should compile SMP + M386.
