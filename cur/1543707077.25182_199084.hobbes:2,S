Hi Olaf.
I took a look at this. The logic that I introduced when moving the *config
target to scripts/kconfig/Makefile had this side-effect.
To fix it I have to do too much changes to the top-level Makefile - and I do
not see such a big benefit here.
So unless someone comes with good arguments I will let the current non-optimal
behaviour stay.
