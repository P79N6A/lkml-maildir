James,
I NACK'd this patch in an earlier email and CC'd you on it:
"ioremap-balanced-with-iounmap-drivers-scsi-3w-9xxxc.patch"
Reason for NACK:  Whoever sprinkled iounmap() calls through various drivers put
                             this one in the wrong place, where
register accesses will occur
                             afterward while shutting down the card.
