Run a command that attempts to use policy-based routing (doing
something "benign" like a listing).  If it fails then good chance
that it isn't compiled in :-)
[ or it may simply mean that the appropriate modules are not loaded,
so beware that one :]
That command would need to be /sbin/ip or /sbin/tc or whatever.
If you want to ferrit out what proc looks like with and without
routing policy enabled, that would be another way to do it.
