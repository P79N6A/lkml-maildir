	Hello All ,  In the last week rather than the discussion of
	technical merit of an idea We have decent (i'll admit) discussion
	of (imo) legal & emotive matters have surround the idea .
	Also imo doing it on a list devoted to the discussions on the
	linux kernel ,  Instead of on it own list or privately .
	Please move the discussion of the Kernel list !  Tia ,  JimL
