After some additional debugging the problem appears to be that both 
lzo1x_decompress_safe (from miniLZO) and lzo1x_decompress (from the 'Tiny' 
version) both are somehow corrupting memory.
*** glibc detected *** ./tinytest: double free or corruption (out): 0x08070e60 
***
The buffer at 0x08070e60 is the one I allocated specifically for the new 
random data tests. It has the same location when it is allocated as it is 
when free()'d, so the corruption has to be coming from somewhere. The problem 
*might* be in my code - that is, I might have made a mistake in the read() 
from /dev/urandom. I'm going to go test that now.
