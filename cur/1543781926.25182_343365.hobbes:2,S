Yes, the task_struct can't go away, but if process exited this
task_struct is just chunk of garbage. I think the intent was to
protect against this case.
However, I agree with you, locking the tasklist_lock can't help,
and the code is wrong.
posix_timer_event() first checks that the thread (SIGEV_THREAD_ID
case) does not have PF_EXITING flag, then it calls send_sigqueue()
which locks task list. But if the thread exits in between the kernel
will oops.
posix_timer_event() runs under k_itimer.it_lock, but this does not
help if that thread was not the only one in thread group, in this
case we don't call exit_itimers().
The comment is wrong too. ->sighand can't change, we are clearing
posix timer on exec, and tasklist can't prevent ->sighand from
going away..
Ingo, Roland, George, am I wrong?
Oleg.
