Speaking of volatile, "register" is probably just as unwanted.
Then, "extern inline" is one thing to catch (does not happen
that often, but it does not cost too much either).

Really? There are a lot of ifdefs in existing code, and it is
probably inevitable to add some in newer code ... overall
leading to more false positives and cluttering the output.
Or am I gone wrong somewhere?

for -> foreach, although it does not functionally change anything.
Yeah, Perl is funny, for(one arg) is actually foreach().
Quite confusing to for(three args).

Or last if $#o == $#c. Again, personal taste (=do it your way).
I do not think $#a is any cheaper than scalar(@a) anyway.

Safe? Or intended? Did you want to allow regexes?
Otherwise...
	return $_[0] =~ /\Q$_[1]\E/ && $_[0] !~ /".*\Q$_[1]\E.*"/;

Gotta love perl. Perhaps one language where you'll always find a
way to circumvent any CodingStyle ever written :p

I say thee 79. But we had that more or less already.

Although scalar might bind as hard as sizeof in C, I suggest parentheses.
(Or $#)
	while ($remaining > 1 && scalar(@opened) > scalar(@closed))

save a capture operation:	/^.#\s*ifn?def/
