The kernel message log would at least tell you what symbol
is missing and then you/we can determnine why and where that
symbol is located.  Maybe there's just another module that needs
to be loaded before nfsd.ko.  And try using modprobe instead
of insmod since modprobe will look for module dependencies.

| 1. rpc.mountd
| 2. exportfs -r
