No, because some of them might be in modules.

Exactly.

I want several things :)
 - For PCI, platform, of_platform, and maybe a couple others, I need the
DMA ops to go through a data structure attached to the device. For now,
I'm attaching it to firmware_data but I'll submit a way for archs to
actually add fields to the device instead for performances reason.
 - I want the ability to link devices in the system to their Open
Firmware node via the above same structure. I will have rules for
various bus types, to be able to do that. 
 - There are other users of that notifier, mostly embedded stuff using
platform or soc bus type for fixup-type tasks.
Now, it could be possible that the notifier that does the later for USB
would itself be a module that links on top of USB, in which case,
comparing the bus types remains possible.
Which means that in the end, your idea of doing 
bus_register_notify(struct bus_type *, struct notifier_block *);
Is workable, however, as I explained earlier, there is still a small
problem of how you initialize the notifier head in struct bus_type.
bus_register is not a good way because that would create a nasty
ordering requirement between code that attaches those notifiers and
whatever initcall registers the bus type. An option here might be to
have an "initialized" field that is statically set to 0 and have
bus_register_notify() test it and initialize the notifier head...
