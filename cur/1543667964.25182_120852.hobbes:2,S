All G400 and newer matroxfb users have dualhead system, so number is
not that small. Definitely not from my point of view ;-)
Problem is that Debian unstable still supports 2.2.x kernels
(kernel-image-2.2.20... & 2.2.22) and this version supports only 0/32/64/...
minors. 
So if you filled bug against makedev, you have to fill bug against 2.2.x
kernels too - either remove them or patch them, as otherwise updated
makedev has to conflict with kernels << 2.4.0.
