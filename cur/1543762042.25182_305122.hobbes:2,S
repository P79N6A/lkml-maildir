Yes, that's the conclusion I was coming to from your excellent traces.
I notice that although both i386 and sparc64 use pgtable-nopud.h, the
i386 pud_clear does nothing at all and the sparc64 pud_clear resets to 0.
If that really is the problem, well, I get as easily mixed between
the levels as the next man, and haven't a clue which is the right
way to do it - beyond i386 not seeing these nr_pte bugs.
But if this is the issue, I don't see how it's new to my freepgt
patches - beyond the fact that they add this BUG_ON consistency check.
