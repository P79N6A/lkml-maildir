[Note: I didn't have legacy hardware terminals in mind.
I was thinking more of a software terminal written from
scratch in utf-8 filesystems world.]

Ie the convenience of iterating over a fixed size
character encoding in the terminal queue is negated
by other costs (legacy 8-bit filesystem support,
utf-8 control characters, et al)?
(I caught the discussion further down after posting.)
I'm spiritually with the "abort" people on this issue,
any opportunity to stab locale-overloaded character
values and arcane character encodings with shift
states in the heart is not to be passed up. "Every
character in every language has a unique value
everywhere that it is used, or we are not finished
fixing this yet."
But I agree with Linus that it is an admin policy
issue, not a kernel issue.
Thanks for your time,
