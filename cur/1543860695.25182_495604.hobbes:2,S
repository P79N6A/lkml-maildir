Sure it does.
Try "strace hdparm -I /dev/sr0" and notice the two ioctl() calls.
The problem is that libata/SCSI always fail it for some reason.
Ditto for me right now when I tried it with an SG_IO passthru command.
Contrary to my other posting, I actually *do* have a libata-controlled
DVD/RW drive in my box here.  So I'll try and see what's happening.
Still digging..
