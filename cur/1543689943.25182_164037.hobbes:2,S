Well, strictly speaking, __u8 is an internal gcc not kernel type.
Now that C99 has defined size-based types, I would prefer that we start
using those...  They are a bit more verbose than "u8" but I think look
better, and more important, are more portable in the long term than __u8.
Whenever I see "__u8", I think "non-standard, gcc-specific dependency"
