Which is why devfs is compatible with the current method
of doing things.  Drivers that do not need to be changed for
other reasons do not need to be changed for devfs.
I have been able to do some really neat things with the
epca.c driver using devfs easily.  The same actions
with the current architecture involve gross hacks and
/proc pollution.  Being able to tell driver status at
a glance, identify boards and modules, all with just
the kernel portion of devfs and moving about 10 lines
of code around.  No userspace daemons trying to work
magic through /proc files, just register the devices
with _names_ that reflect what they are. 
It is wonderful.
As near as I can tell, arguments with respect to
"persistent device ownership" are fluff.  I have
yet to see one detailed.  Sure, I _could_ change 
the ownership of /dev/fd0 so that a given group
of users can access it directly. I can also give
that group of users permission to access mtools
through sudo to manage floppies.
