Comment is wrong, of course: this patch adds range to the kernel_param
structure.  But I'm not convinced that it's a great idea.  It could be
added using the same method (kp->arg) used to extend the others instead.
(Same logic applied to spinlocking param variants).
It comes down to usage: currently there are few range-needing users, but
maybe that's because MODULE_PARM didn't support it.  So I would drop
this or implement it as a wrapper, and later we can add it when it takes
over the world.  Although I'd probably just add args to
module_param_call: I like having it as the "base".
The other thing is the min=1 max=0 case: I'd prefer INT_MAX, INT_MIN
etc. instead I think so there's no special cases.
Thanks!
Rusty.
