I think drivers/hotplug/pci_hotplug_util.c implements something like you 
need, pci_read_config_byte_nodev().
Of course that's currently only available for PCI hotplug, and for all I 
can see the concept is somewhat messed up, but maybe that's an opportunity 
to clean things up?
Currently, pci_read_config_byte_nodev() will construct a fake struct 
pci_dev, and then use the normal pci_read_config_byte(). I think it 
makes more sense to actually do things the other way around.
For reading/writing config space, we need to know (dev, fn), and need the 
access method (struct pci_ops), which is a property of the bridge plus 
possibly some private data (the arch's sysdata). So the member
	struct pci_ops *ops;
of struct pci_dev is actually not necessary, it will always be
pdev->ops == pdev->bus->ops AFAICS.
So we could instead have
	pci_bus_read_config_byte(struct pci_bus *bus, u8 dev, u8 fn, ...)
and for common use
	static inline pci_read_config_byte(struct pci_dev, *pdev, ...)
	{
		return pci_bus_read_config_byte(pdev->bus,
						PCI_SLOT(pdev->devfn),
						PCI_FUNC(pdev->devfn));
	}
The PCI hotplug controllers / ACPI could then use the pci_bus_* variants, 
when they don't have a struct pci_dev available. They would need at least 
the root bridge's struct pci_bus, though.
