If you need to browse heavily illustrated web pages on an embedded system (one
small enough to not have a disk), then use a decent browser...
/me runs...  ;)
Usually ulimits can help and tons of swap is uncalled for - but this case where
Netscape makes X consume memory on Netscape's behalf is so rare (I guess), that
I don't think this is a problem worthy of the embedded-systems-VM-discussion.
