I have our fileserver running completly on XFS (because its quota &
journaled).
I have an internal 60GB HW RAID 1 and an external 4 disk SCSI 400GB
software RAID 5 both running XFS. The Server is NFS, Samba and Appletalk
(thought that is almost not used). NFS is not the main point (except the
servers for sharing a backup disk and two office PCs who run linux there
is no NFS traffic, the rest ~50 PCs connect via Samba). It's Xeon single
CPU box, but I have an SMP kernel because of HT. 2GB ram.
I haven't had a single XFS connected error. It surved 5 hard reboots
because of another external disk that got berserk and forced me to turn
on/off the server.
A nightly backup on another HD on the same box goes well, even from 4
other servers via NFS.

well there is the linux-xfs ML ... :)

lack of support. in my opinion there work some very bright persons. Main
problem is, that it comes from a system which is completly different
designed than linux and I think this problem still triggers those SMP,
etc bugs.

Well. I am not yet in the TB leage and 200+ user boxes, etc. So I can't
say about that. But that will come soon, and then I will see if I have
to runt about that.
