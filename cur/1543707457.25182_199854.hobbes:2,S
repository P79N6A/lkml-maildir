Hello all,
I am not registered with the list, so please CC if possible - thanks.
I am not sure if this is a problem to report (as opposed to my old 
system's problem), but I get this now in dmesg after building 2.6.3 
tonight:
nfs_read_super: get root inode failed
This is 2.6.3 mounting a NFS from an old 486 box running Linux 2.2.13 
- and the NFS processes of the same age.
The mount still works OK though; logs from the 486 report no 
warnings/errors apart from the version 3 is unknown.
But I am intrigued why it gives this warning (and the inode.c code 
seems to imply it is a fatal error, AFAIK) if it still works?
Thanks, and regards,
Nick
