Hi,
   Could someone tell me if this is a bug, or if this should
be used in a different manner?  I am using 
pci_assign_resource(dev, 7);
Where:
dev->resource[7].start = 0
dev->resource[7].end = size to allocate
dev->resource[7].flags = IORESOURCE_MEM
In pci_assign_resource, 'min' gets assigned to PCIBIOS_MIN_MEM
(all that is important here is that it is not 0).
Also, 'align' gets assigned to 'res->start' (resource[7].start
from above).  which is 0.
This routine calls allocate_resource, which calls find_resource,
in which we find that new->start (again resource[7].start above)
gets set to min.  Then, there is the fateful line:
new->start = (new->start + align - 1) & ~(align - 1);
Since we know that align = 0, then ~(align-1) = 0, thus
new->start get assigned 0 again.  This doesn't work, it 
should be left to be min.
In kernel 2.4.18, the align variable was set to size, and thus
this all works.  I can get it to be set to size again by using
resource 6 instead of 7, but I don't think that is the correct
solution here.
I would propose a patch, but I'm not sure what the intent here
is.
Could responses please be CC'd to me?
Thanks,
S. Baker
