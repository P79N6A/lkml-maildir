John,
apologies for the late reply - been offline the past two weeks on holiday.
Just listing the two devices in a comment would be sufficient.

Including the above paragraph in a comment would be a good thing.
I don't know if this spec is publicly available. But even if it is,
typically only a handful of people will be familiar enough with it
to know where to look in it.

Yes - sounds reasonable to me too.

I think I'd keep it simpler until someone proves we need it.
I've read the rest of the thread and don't recall any such proof.

That's fine - just listing the Thinkpad T21 in a comment is helpful.
If you happen to know the firmware version too, that would be even better.

After thinking about this more, I'm convinced it's broken if a 64-bit BAR
is present on the PCI device. It doesn't matter if the MMIO value is
greater than 4GB or not. The problem is pci_dev->resource[i] does NOT
map 1:1 with PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_0+(i*4).
> So, is the current patch acceptable?
I don't think so. 64-bit BARs are just too common today.
One solution is to use a seperate variable to track the offset into
PCI config space. ie use "i" to walk through pci_dev->resource[]
and add "unsigned int pcibar_offset" to keep track of 32 vs 64-bit BARs.

I don't see why that's necessary.
thanks,
grant
