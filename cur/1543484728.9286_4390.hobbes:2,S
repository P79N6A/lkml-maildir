Ok. Thanks for the help.  Course how is changed going to be anything other
than 0?  ioctl only returns 0 if ok or -1 on error.  So it doesn't
appear that would work.  No information on wether the CD was changed will
be returned.  The third argument is ioctl() by convention char*, and as far 
as I can tell the only way to get any information from the kernel.  So it
would still appear that I need acces to the Uniform cdrom data structures
defined in <linux/cdrom.h> which are only available if I #define __KERNEL__
