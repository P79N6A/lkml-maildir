We use a DLT7000 here with no problems (it works very well :) ).  The only
thing we did was increase the static size of the tape I/O buffer first in
linux/drivers/scsi/st_options.h:

This allows you to use a bigger DMA I/O buffer without running in to
possible memory fragmentation in the < 16MB DMA range when using a buffer
bigger than the default size (we had problems with this).
We're not using BRU, but I doubt there will be any problems.
