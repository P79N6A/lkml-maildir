But it doesn't jump to the `if' (this is what I would expect from the
`continue' here), but to the third statement of the `for'.
Maybe better to ask, is the test expected to be fired after *each*

Correct, in this particular case (and I checked that also other users which
uses `continue' inside the loop don't pass PIDTYPE_PID).

A static analyzer. Stay tuned, we will announce it later, it's in the state
of development :).
