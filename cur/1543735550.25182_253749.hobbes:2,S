Just out of interest - can you say what tests you ran here - for
example whether you tried allocating large amounts of memory from a
userspace process without running X and/or touching bits of memory
mapped hardware? You say a kernel compile works fine so can you rule
out this being X taking down the system (you're previous mail seemed
somehat unclear).
