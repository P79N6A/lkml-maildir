I was thinking about having that fb_mmap replacement too. But then I
got worried because that generic implementation of nopage/etc would
need to handle whether the driver's fb memory was vmalloced, kmalloced
or a mixture if some do that. So I figured let's aim low and just pull
in the core part that does the setup and page tracking stuff. I hope
that's okay.

Ok. Will check out when implementing.
