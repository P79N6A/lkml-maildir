(CURRENT->sector, right?). What is "the simplest" case? (dd something).

No, CURRENT->sector is always the "current" sector. When you call
end_request, end_that_request_first will adjust rq->sector for
you.

Probably an end_request somewhere. The logic goes something like this:
- receive request
- transfer CURRENT->current_nr_sectors in direction of CURRENT->cmd
  to CURRENT->buffer from/to CURRENT->sector
- end_request
You never need to look at CURRENT->nr_sectors if you are not handling
clustered requests yourself, end_request handles that for you.
FWIW, I have verified request handling with a dummy driver I wrote.
It even handles merged requests with "holes", i.e. non-consequitive
buffer heads.
