The short answer is that Linux works that way because the network folks
want it to and quote an RFC which says that's alowed conforming behaviour. 
It also does proxy arp by default and bunch of other stuff. Your packets
are probably going out the other interface.
The long answer is that you can probably use iproute2 to route packets by
source address to the correct interface. I haven't used 2.2 in a while and
didn't ever try that back when, so I am totally guessing. You might repeat
this question in the cosl.networking for a better answer if iproute2 won't
do this in 2.2.

2.4 is better in many ways, but that implementation decision hasn't
changed. What you probably want is a single rule to choose interface by
source address, but you can get what you need by routing as long as you
have only a few subnets (the tables are 255 entries long IIRC). 
Hope this helps.
