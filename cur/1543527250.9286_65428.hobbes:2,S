Hi Alan and folks@lkml...
Another question. What parts of the BIOS (say, full flavored with PCI,
APM, ACPI, etc.) does a running Linux kernel depend on? If I look at 2.3.47,
I could try to give an answer:
PCI BIOS: Optionally. Linux handles PCI even if no PCI BIOS is present.
APM BIOS: If CONFIG_APM, then Linux needs the APM BIOS.
ACPI BIOS: If Linux wants to use ACPI, it needs an ACPI BIOS. Or at least
 	some ACPI-related values which it gets from the BIOS.
ISA PnP: No clue whatsoever...
Could you comment on that?
THX,
Thomas.
