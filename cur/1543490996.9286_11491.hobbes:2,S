There  is no  support for  this  (at the  moment). ISO  6429 (aka  ECMA-48)
defines  terminal control  sequences to  scroll in  "page memory"  upwards,
downwards, left  and right.  (See 
http://www.ecma.ch/
).  I have  started to
implement missing pieces  from ISO 6429 (CBT,  CHT, CVT, ...) but  so far i
haven't touched any  substantial code (like implementing  page memory would
mean), especially since i want to avoid  any clashes with the plans to make
the console code ISO 2022 compliant.
My  best sugestion  at the  moment  would be  to  use the  mouse wheel  for
selection  of text.  That  shouldn't be  too difficult  and  would be  most
helpful for trackball users  with a wheel. You will also  want to check how
XFree86 handles the wheel, so that there won't be different usage depending
on wether a program is run in a xterm or on the console.
