Sorry about that. Here is a new changelog:
changelog:
	- add a notifier mechanism to the low level idle loop. You can
	  register a callback function which gets invoked on entry and exit
	  from the low level idle loop. The low level idle loop is defined as
	  the polling loop, low-power call, or the mwait instruction. Interrupts
	  processed by the idle thread are not considered part of the low level
	  loop. The notifier can be used to measure precisely how much is spent
	  in useless execution (or low power mode). The perfmon subsystem uses it
	  to turn on/off monitoring.
