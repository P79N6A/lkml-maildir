Subject: [patch 09/33] xen: Add nosegneg capability to the vsyscall page notes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Add the "nosegneg" fake capabilty to the vsyscall page notes. This is
used by the runtime linker to select a glibc version which then
disables negative-offset accesses to the thread-local segment via
%gs. These accesses require emulation in Xen (because segments are
truncated to protect the hypervisor address space) and avoiding them
provides a measurable performance boost.
