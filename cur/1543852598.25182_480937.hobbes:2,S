I was thinking the __bitwise annotation on GPIO_IN and GPIO_OUT should
address that problem, but for some reason it isn't doing that.  I must
be doing something wrong; even "sparse" isn't warning when passing a
bogus parameter.

To be clear ... having two different function calls is a brand
new proposal.  :)
Agreed on readable, and I do recall the problem.  If I can't get
the __bitwise annotation to behave, that's how I'll do it.
