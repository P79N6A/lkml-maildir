Either not use any pvops or make sure all the pvops patching is atomic
on the local CPU.
Ok you can avoid MCEs by not enabling them until after you patch (which I think
is the case currently), but it's more difficult with NMIs.
The plain NMI handler is probably auditable.
Or set a flag that makes the NMI handler just return during patching?

Yes, but NMI could happen inbetween
