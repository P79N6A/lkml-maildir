Hmmm.  True.

I think that it is useful to have a construct that means what someone
apparently thought dep_bool meant, i.e. a bool which can only be 'y' if
a corresponding tristate is not 'n'.  *Any* compile-time options to
modules could use this.  Those filesystem R/W options are just examples
of where this is useful.
So if it's up to a vote, I say change the parsers.  (Of course, I know
it isn't, but anyway....)
