Yes, if we need it at all.

"Bypass" in the sense of directly calling the inode ops rather than the
vfs helpers is undesirable.  "Bypass" in the sense of temporarily
setting a task flag indicating that permission checking should be
disabled for an internal access attempt seems ok.

NFS will want a fssid in order to have file access checks applied
against the client process' SID if/when the client process' context
becomes available.  But it isn't really necessary here as far as I can
see; the cachefiles module is not trying to act on behalf of a task, but
instead is performing an internal access to local cache that should
always succeed, and the usual permission checking for userspace is
handled by the fs before cachefiles is called.
