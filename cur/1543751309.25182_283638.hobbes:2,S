I don't know who had this discussion and did this "decision", but 
for record I disagree.

That's incredibly ugly. I always hate these checks in source code
because it's never clear what exactly they are testing for. 
And requires unreasonable work to find out when exactly the feature was 
added. And it doesn't really work when there are backports in older trees.
In short there are many drawbacks. HAVE_* is much nicer.
