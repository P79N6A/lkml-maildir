Hmmm ... so we better also make sure all users call this from within
an "#ifdef ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN" themselves (or else make this a config
option defined in the arch/.../defconfig of archs that support this
and then make the calling code's Kconfig option "depends on ... &&
ARCH_FOO").
(Just saw a previous thread, Andrew seems to have beaten me to this observation)
