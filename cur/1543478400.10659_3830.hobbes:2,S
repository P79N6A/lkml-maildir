Netscape 3.x and 4.x use a previous generation of the
NSPR library.  In the user-level thread scheduling area,
there is no code in common with the current NSPR v3.0,
which used in the Mozilla browser.  So looking at
the NSPR v3.0 source code to track down a bug in
Netscape 4.x could be misleading.
The periodic SIGALRM signals are used by both the
first and second generation of NSPR to implement
pre-emptive user-level thread scheduling.  So the
SIGALRM signals are normal.
(I am working on the current generation of NSPR.)
