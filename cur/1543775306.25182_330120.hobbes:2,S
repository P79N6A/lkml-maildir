The exact patch for kernel/module.c that was marked for 2.6.11-rcX hit 
general release in patch-2.6.12.
What $PID is bash running as ?  Martin's comments on this are seem most 
relevant.
Can you build your own (2 pages of code) init process, that does 
something along the lines of
 * gracefully handles SIGCHLD
 * forks
 * executes bash
 * waits for bash to exit much like the patch does
So bash is not running a pid 1.  While nash is expected to run as init, 
bash is not, so fixing bash might also break it (its a complex beast).
