Well, I would like but insmod crash my system (I have tried it without the vc option):
atyfb : 3D RAGE PRO (PQFP, PCI) [0x4750 rev 0x7e] 512K RESV, 14.31818 MHz PLL, 100 MHz MCLK
BUS_CNTL DAC_CNTL MEM_CNTL EXT_MEM_CNTL CRTC_GEN_CNTL DSP_CONFIG DSP_ON_OFF
860000001 06010080 0081838 00000000     04000000 00000000 00000000
PLL cc cc 24 df f6 04 00 fd 8e 9e 65 05 40 00 00 00
and the screen on it turn on and show me vertical lines of blue, light blue, green and repeat.
But the system freeze :-(
Have I done something wrong?
Thanks you really much,
