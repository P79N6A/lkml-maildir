I owe an apology here.  ap->qc_allocated & ~(1 << qc->tag) test isn't
correct.  Sorry.  qc deferring happens after qc is allocated so the
condition can trigger (although it should be rare) even when nothing is
going wrong, so I guess it should be WARN_ON((qc->flags &
ATA_QCFLAG_RESULT_TF) && link->sactive).
Sorry. :-)
