Wrong fix. swab32() is the guilty party here - it should be
static inline __u32 swab32(__u32 x)
{
	return
                ((x & (__u32)0x000000ffUL) << 24) |
                ((x & (__u32)0x0000ff00UL) <<  8) |
                ((x & (__u32)0x00ff0000UL) >>  8) |
                ((x & (__u32)0xff000000UL) >> 24) );
}
Ditto for other stuff in linux/byteorder/swab.h
My fault - I didn't realize that the bloody thing was a macro (it
obviously shouldn't be, exactly due to problems with side effects).
Alan, what do you prefer? I think that fixing the macros in swab.h is the
Right Thing(tm).
