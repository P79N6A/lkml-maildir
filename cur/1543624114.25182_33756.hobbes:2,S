... but only if you're really dealing with anonymous pages,
I suspect that people will use NUMA machines more for workloads
where most pages belong to mappings, because if a scientific
calculation can be split out to a cluster you don't need the
cost of NUMA hardware.
Not sure if my guess is right though ;)

Rmap will also make it possible to have the lru lock per
zone (or per node), which should give rather nice behaviour
for large SMP and NUMA systems ... even if the workload
isn't made up of anonymous pages ;)
Btw, what is the "ram binding migration stuff" you are
talking about and why would rmap not be able to do it in
a nice way ?
