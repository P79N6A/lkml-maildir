The patch I commented on did not split sectors value into two, in that
case it's a big problem. When split and expose only the one, it's not an
issue.

Great.

Note that I've been travelling and didn't really track the thread
closely before that, but it seems to me that most of the latency
incurred is an artifact of long code paths hanging off bi_end_io. Maybe
it would be better to try and fix some of that and get both good irq
completion latencies, while still maintaining decent drive throughput.
That said, this second version looks better from an inclusion point of
view. Better fix those manual q->max_sectors settings first.
