I havn't tested your patch, but with CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y it locks up and
without it it doesn't. It isn't my laptop so can't do any futher
investigations at the moment, but the owner was very happy that he now could
plug the power without the computer locking up so probably he'll let me do
some more tests on it tomorrow.
