I do pay more attention to mail sent to the @mit.edu address, but I
don't recall any reservation requests sent to my @thunk.org address
(nope, don't see it; maybe it got caught in my spam filters?  When did
you send it, precisely?)

I think 0x0020 was used at one point, but I can't remember what it was
used for.  It's almost certainly not in wide use at this point, so
it's probably safe to use it; OTOH it's not like we're running out of
bits at this point.
