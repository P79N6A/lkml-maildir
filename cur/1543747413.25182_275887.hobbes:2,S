indeed it's not. THere were projects that used the x86 atomic.h
header.... but failed to notice that its not actually using the lock
prefix if you don't define CONFIG_SMP. Now it's purely up to luck if the
userspace headers in /usr/include have CONFIG_SMP defined or not, so
there have been cases where people compiled on an UP box and got racy
code. Was a production level project; normally they built on SMP but
once they built on UP .. poof ;)
so atomic.h is *dangerous* for userspace to use, at least on x86. It
gives a false feeling of atomicity.
So dangerous that for the RH/Fedora distros, we don't ship the
questionable parts of it.
