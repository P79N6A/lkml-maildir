This is done without too much trouble.

I've taken your advice and added the test at the top.

Well, this one is quite a pain in the ass.
I'm not very fond of ->rq_select_barrier() approach for the following 
reasons.
* That removes possibility of correct synchronization.  With 
blk_queue_ordered() approach, we can later add 
blk_queue_[un]lock_ordered() to achieve correct synchronization if that 
becomes necessary, but with ->rq_select_barrier() approach, the 
low-level driver ends up having less control over what's gonna happen when.
* Changing ordered mode is not supposed to be a frequent operation and 
the blk_queue_ordered() interface makes that explicit.
So, I added ide_driver_t->protocol_changed() callback which gets called 
whenever dma/multimode changes occur.  Unfortunately, dma/multmode 
changes can be committed with or without context, and with or without 
queue lock.  As blk_queue_ordered uses the queue lock for 
synchronization, this becomes issue.
I tried to distinguish places where the changes occur while queue lock 
is held from the other.  Not only was it highly error-prone, it couldn't 
be done without modifying/auditing all low-level drivers as some drivers 
(cs5520) use the same function which touches dma setting 
(cs5520_tune_chipset) from both ->speedproc (called with queuelock) and 
->ide_dma_check (called without queuelock).
One alternative I'm thinking of is using a workqueue to call 
blk_queue_ordered, such that we don't have to guess whether or not we're 
called with queuelock held.  Unfortunately, this will give us a small 
window where wrong barrier requests can hit the drive.
Bartlomiej, any ideas?
Jens, as this one seems to need some time to settle, I'm gonna post 
updated patchset for post-2.6.15 without ide-fua patch, so that the 
other stuff can be pushed into -mm.  I think we can live without ide-fua 
for a while.  :-)
Thanks.
