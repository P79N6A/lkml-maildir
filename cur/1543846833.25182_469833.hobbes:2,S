And you can add/remove signal events using existing kevent api between
calls.

And creating special cases for usual events is bad.
There is unified way to deal with events in kevent -
add/remove/modify/wait on them, signals are just usual events.

I think you wanted to say, that 'all event mechanism except the most
commonly used poll/select/epoll use timespec'.
I designed it to be similar to poll(), it is really good interface.
Nature of the waiting is to wait for some time, so I put there that
'some time'.
