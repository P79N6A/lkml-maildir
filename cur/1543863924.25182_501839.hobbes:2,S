Another aside:  Tejun took my libata iomap and came up with something 
I'm quite happy with, so libata will /finally/ switch over to using the 
new iomap interfaces for 98% of all drivers, as of 2.6.21.
Look at "[PATCHSET] Managed device resources, take #3" on LKML if you're 
interested.  Tejun's 'devres' stuff makes it a lot easier for drivers to 
reserve, map, unmap, and free various hardware resources.
