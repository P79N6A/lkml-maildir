Okay, due to my lack of detail from previous posts, I thought I'd
restate everything with a little more detail.  Previously I was using
2.6.7-mm7 (bk-acpi.patch and bk-usb.patch were reversed), everything
worked fine.  Upgraded to 2.6.8-rc2 and my machine would just stop at
starting cupsd.  Previous to reversing bk-acpi.patch and bk-usb.patch,
2.6.7-mm7 showed the same behavior.  I unplugged all my USB devices,
and booted, and 2.6.8-rc2 started fine.  I plugged in the keyboard and
I tried to use the keyboard and the result was whichever key was
pressed, that character was repeated numerous times.  No matter what I
could not get a single character to appear, the always appeared like
"sssssssssssssssssssssss".  Went and grabbed an old PS/2 Keyboard, and
proceeded to gather the information David Brownell suggested.
Attached are my dmesg's from each kernel, each time I booted fully,
then plugged the USB keyboard in, and then the USB mouse.  My kernel
config is also attached, along with the output of lspci -v, (David
Brownell mentioned "lspci -w" but this isn't a valid option, and I
assume he meant -v).  Also thought it might be worth mentioning that
I'm using a Belkin USB Keyboard, and Logitech USB Mouse.  It might
also be worth mentioning I don't have a USB printer at all, I use cups
for network printing.
