Subject: why is (*receive_room) in my line discipline being polled?

I'm writing a line discipline for my proprietary protocol at work
over serial on 2.4.22.
I have an internal counter for when receive_room is being called.
In a quiescent, my receive_room method is being polled...(about twice/second).
(no I/O but my devices opened).
Currently I'm using a program called nullmodem which uses pty's to emulate
a serial port...
I don't understand the poll...or why it would happen.
