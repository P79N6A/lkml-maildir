Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt is a good start.
For specific questions I can help out.
For this specific case the problem seems to me that you in the ppc64
case want to include floppy-ppc64.S in the build for the PPC64 case.
So something as simple as:
1) rename floppy.c to floppy-core.c
2) Change Makefile to look like:
floppy-y        := floppy-core.o
floppy-$(PPC64) += floppy-ppc64.o
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Minor detail, This is for sparc64 (see Subject).
I also see that arch/arm[26]/lib/ has special handling for
floppydma.S, so there'a a model to consider also.
