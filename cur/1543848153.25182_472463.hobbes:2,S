Hmmm, I deleted all my 2.6.16 kernels and I can't test a newly compiled 2.6.16 
kernel before the weekend. But if I remember correctly, on previous kernel 
versions skype just generates 100% system load when using the sound device 
after some time (especially after a resume) and stuttered audio but no system 
lockups. Hence, it worked much better than now from the kernel point of view 
but was not usable from the skype users point of view. It was a userspace 
only problem.
regards,
Jörg
