You're misquoting me badly.  I said we can ignore the risk that two
nanosecond resolution timestamps that get changed by two different cpus 
with out-of-sync cycle counter on a smp system and which are fast enough
to free/aquire the inode lock in a smaller time than they're out of sync
(= giving two file changes with the same ns timestamp) can be ignored.
I implied on the systems that don't have a cycle counter and which use
jiffie resolution gettimeofday it can be also ignored, because they're
unlikely to be SMP and dying out too anyways.
