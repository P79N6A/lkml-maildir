I don't use APM monitors. The noise is more frequent than once every few 
seconds. I've tried to reproduce the noise using cpu-intensive programs other 
than seti@home and i failed. I tried compiling a kernel together with heavy 
calculations in The Gimp, but it didn't produce the noise. Could it be a 
problem only triggerd by seti? Is there something special about seti?
