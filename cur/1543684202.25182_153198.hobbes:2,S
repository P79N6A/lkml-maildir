I'd like to see that. Eventually, I'll post some patch to do that, but
first, I need to make Debian to support i386 again (since libstdc++5 in
unstable is now compiled for i486, some apps (apt-get is one of
those...) will SIGILLed to death). I do have some of those boxes (Am386
with SIMM RAM, i386SX-16 with SIPP modules + single ICs :)
