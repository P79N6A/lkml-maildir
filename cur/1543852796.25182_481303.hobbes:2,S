I played with this on xfs a little bit in my spare time, found some
xfs_repair problems.  :)  I'm sure other fs's would have issues as well.
Ideally it would probably be good for the tool to have a "use" mode (try
to use the corrupted fs) and a "check" mode (try to fsck the corrupted fs).
In use   mode, it'd be:  mkfs, fuzz, mount, populate (etc), unmount.
In check mode, it'd be:  mkfs, mount, populate, unmount, fuzz, fsck.
