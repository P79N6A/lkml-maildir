My opinion, which I implied in the previous post but didn't state in so many 
words, is that the whole Real Unix crowd - Chuck Cranor and Matt Dillon, Sun, 
SGI and IBM etc - got off on the wrong track with respect to implementing 
Unix VM semantics, and that we will achieve all the design goals they set for 
themselves in a simpler, more efficient way.  (That is, assuming I ever 
finish debugging the page table sharing[1] and extend it to shared mmaps.)  I 
attribute that whole wrong turn to a too-heavy abstraction of the page table, 
distracting the eye from the observation that the page table itself provides 
sufficient state to do the same job as memory objects.  I'm curious to hear 
Matt's opinion on that by the way, I have to go bother him about this.

Well I don't have any problem with the TLB cost being hidden, what bothers me 
is the complexity of the mechanism required to make the abstraction work.  
Sort-of work I mean, just google 'all-shadowed case' to see one nasty 
difficulty.

It breaks down somewhat as virtual memory range goes way beyond 4GB.  
There's the relatively minor issue of extra levels of tree traversal, 
currently limited to 4 by AMD's architecture but not so limited on other 
architectures.  A bigger problem is what to do about internal fragmentation 
in the page table tree, say if somebody mmaps a 2 TB sparse file, then writes 
one byte every 2 meg.  Bang, 4 gig worth of page tables, this is probably not 
what we want.  IMHO, 'don't do that then' isn't a reasonable response.
What we might want to do there is evict some page tables when they start 
proliferating too much, and that's when we find out we have no good model for 
doing that.  I think this needs to be looked at.
