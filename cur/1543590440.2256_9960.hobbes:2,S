Jeff Mahoney has a patch in progress for this, he currently has the kernel code
working, but needs to do the utilities.  I would hesitate to put the endianness
fixes in before 2.5.1 just because I am conservative about disturbing stable code.
There exists one known bug which one user has hit which required a major code
change to fix.  We are now testing the code, and are in the ironic situation
of hesitating to merge in a bug fix out of fear that the bugfix code is large and
untested, and it might have bugs that more than one user will hit.:-/
I think we are going to make the new code an option until it has been
extensively tested.
I think that 2.4.4 is stable, and I say this based upon us getting lots of users
with
hardware bugs and none with bugs not fixed in 2.4.4 in the entire time since 2.4.4
was released.

you also need a patch for quotas.

you can ask nikita for a copy of reiserfs_raw, a version of reiserfs designed for
squid.  It is substantially faster.
