(This has nothing to do with linux-kernel, sorry...)
I don't think anything particular in that message suggests he actually got
rooted? It just seems that somebody tried to exploit lprNG hole (or
something else) and the daemon logged that. Of course, it *is* perfectly
possible, that he _got_ rooted (although he said he was running redhat-7.0
with all the updates). 
(The attacker may have tried other attacks so if he got rooted, those above
are not necessarily the related log messages. In any case, a 'smart' intruder
would have cleaned the log. Also, 'smart' attacker propably uses something
more advanced as backdoor than /etc/inetd.conf these days.)
Or is there something that actually indicates a succesfull intrusion in the
log snippet that I'm missing?
