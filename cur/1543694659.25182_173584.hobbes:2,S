1)  When I burn a CD with kernel 2.6.0-test6 using cdrecord it locks up
my machine at various times during the write.
2)  When using kernel version 2.4.22(and previous 2.4 kernels) I have
had no trouble burning CDs.  When I started using 2.6.0 I began to have
problems with cdburning.  It seems to be a problem when I burn data
CD's.  When I start cdrecord it goes through the basic beginning steps
as I will show, then it hangs the machine.  It can occur before the
write starts or sometime during the middle of the write.  After it locks
up I am forced to reset.  The configuration for the 2.6.0 kernel is the
same as the 2.4.22 kernel.  I have the same configuration(minus of
course the alsa drivers in 2.6).
3)  the command I use is . . .
	cdrecord -v dev=0,0,0 -data name.iso
	again, this works fine in 2.4.22
the program output before freezing is ..  .
