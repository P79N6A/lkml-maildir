In general they should be able to deal with those accesses. They result in
extended type 0/1 configuration cycles which are defined already in HT I/O Link
Spec 1.10. So if unexpectedly problems arise then it is time to add a pci-quirk.
But at the moment there is no need for further discussion on this subject
because Andi refuses to add support for Barcelona CF8/CFC ECS access.

Andreas
