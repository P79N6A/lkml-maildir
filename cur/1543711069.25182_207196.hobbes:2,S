Dear Ping,
Vojtech posted your 2.6 patch to linux-kernel yesterday, so I examined it
(Subject: [PATCH 32/44] Update of Wacom driver from Ping Cheng (from Wacom)).
Unlike the 2.4 version, it does not feature a reset thread. Please tell
me why that thread was required in 2.4.
Or perhaps it was present in your original submission which I lost and
Vojtech removed that element of the patch?
Yours truly,
-- Pete
