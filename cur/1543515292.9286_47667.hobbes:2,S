   with "setserial -a /dev/ttyS0" the RS/TX led was turned  off
   so everyone that use setserial on rc* after boot is unable
   to see this strange behavior.
Oh, that problem.  I know about it.  I'll get a driver update to Linus
ASAP.  I still haven't gotten the serial console working, but it's
broken currently, and I can get a driver to Linus which has at least
this (and a few other problems) fixed.
