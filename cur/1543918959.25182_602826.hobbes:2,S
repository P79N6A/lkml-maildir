I went through and did the basics. Disabled SMP (it's a core 2 duo  
cpu), tried with noapic, nolapic settings, tried with pci=irqroute,  
and tried with acpi=off. Poking through the module code I noticd in  
cx88-mpeg.c the irq_debug option. I think this is the debug switch I  
want so I'll try to gather more info this week. At the very least it  
looks like it will help me walk through the code to get a better idea  
of what's going on.
