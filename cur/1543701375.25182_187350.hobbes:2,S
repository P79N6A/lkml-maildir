Well, there's fam.  But AFAIK that's all done in user space, and your 
approach would be significantly more efficient (as a matter of fact, fam 
could be modified to use your change device as a first level of 
notification.)
I'll be interested in testing this, or (if you wish) help get it done. 
I'm a kernel hacking newbie at the moment, but I have tinkered around 
enough with the VFS to be able to work on this.  Up to you.
