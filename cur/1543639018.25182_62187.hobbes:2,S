Ok, sounds like that one ends up having to be a fixed segment (I wonder if
Wine can take advantage of it? looks like it is hardcoded to base 0x400,
which is probably fine for Wine anyway - just map something at the right
address - but it looks CPL0 only? Might be ok to just make it available to
user space).
