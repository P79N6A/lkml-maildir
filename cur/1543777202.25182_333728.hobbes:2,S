Bingo. THere was no event0 and event1, although the evdev module was
loaded!
I had to unload evdev and reload it again to get the event devices.
Seems to be either a bug in evdev or in udev.
Sorry for the noise. Whom should I ask now?
Best wishes
Norbert

The major difference between a thing that might go wrong
and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a
thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually
turns out to be impossible to get at or repair.
