Subject: forcing PCI device IRQ numbers ?

is there any way to force the assignment of PCI device IRQ's ?
i have a situation in one of my machines where it ends up with 2
digital audio interfaces plus the SCSI adapter sitting on the same
IRQ. Not a disaster, but not good either. There are, of course, free
IRQs, otherwise I wouldn't be asking.
