I am a gentoo user an compile a lot of things. I also use freq scaling with my
Athlon XP on nforce2 with cpu disconnect enabled.
idle at ~1400MHz:      ~135 WATT used by system
full load at ~1400MHz: ~150 WATT
full load at ~2200MHz: ~230 WATT
So, if I don't need something very quickly, so can guess that I prefer to do
compiling at low clock speeds... (Suspend won't work for me.)

Prakash
