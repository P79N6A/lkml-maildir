	My company is developing a critical telephony system and are looking
for the opportunity to deploy on Intel/Linux (as well as
Sparc/Solaris). I've found some SPARC and Intel platforms
(surprisingly one from Motorola!) that have these hot swap
capabilities under Compact PCI, but I'm having a more difficult time
getting hard information about Linux support for such things,
especially in terms of hot swap cpus rather than just devices. I've
heard of a hig-availability linux implementation called Hard Hat and
other efforts in the works to provide this capability at both the
kernel and application level but I haven't been able to find any hard
information about these rumoured systems. 
Is there an official kernel effort going on to support these features?
How about a semi-official one? I'd appreciate any comments and
pointers regarding this...
