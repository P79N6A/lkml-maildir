I really think you'll eventually confuse yourself terminally, but as long 
as the commit messages end up being meaningful, your "mush everything 
together" clearly is the thing that is going to perform best.

Hey, I'm happy it works for you, but are you sure those 50 other kernel 
hackers aren't confused?
IOW, your work model is pretty extreme, and I'm much more worried about 
mixing up trees by mistake than about the technical side of git per se. 
That's also why I think it's important that the commit logs are 
meaningful: they do end up containing the SHA1 key, so clearly "all the 
information" is there, but if something gets mixed up, I'd like some human 
to be able to eventualyl say "Aaahhh.. _that's_ where it got mixed up".
