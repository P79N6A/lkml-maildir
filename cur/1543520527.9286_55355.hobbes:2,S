The buffer handling is compleatly different in those two situations.

Oh if you are just after a user who is eating out much of systems
resource
then I have the following advice: man ulimits. (Actually you will find
it in man ksh or in the inferior man bash)

I think you not the first guy out there with this wonderfull idea.
But in fact proper system protection does incorporate complete hardware
*virtualization*. This is something that isn't supported by many very
common
CPU designs out there. (IA32 for example) Yes it *can* be done like in
vmware,
but the perforamce penalty for this stuff is HUGE and doesn't justyfy
the gain
of security for the average user. (Guess what: only a minority of
computers is and allways will be on the internet!)

Then think about why Sun made the HARD kernel an option and not the
default...
