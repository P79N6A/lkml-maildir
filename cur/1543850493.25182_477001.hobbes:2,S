Hmmm...that raises a separate issue - how does SELinux label cachefs
inodes?  Does cachefs support xattrs?  Other option is to use a mount
context (mount -o context=...) to apply a single context to all inodes
within it.  Where exactly is the cachefs code available?
I'm also unclear on where you establish the binding between the files
being cached and the cache.  What specifies that e.g. a given NFS mount
should be backed to a given cache?  We need to be able to control that
relationship too, to establish that the cache is being protected
adequately for the source data.

At present, this will show up as the usual checking on mount (security
hooks in do_mount and vfs_kern_mount) and on umount (security hook in
do_umount) by SELinux.  I'm not sure whether you need anything specific
to the cache.
