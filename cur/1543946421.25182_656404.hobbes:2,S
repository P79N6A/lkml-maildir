Well to be honest I based the patch on rt2x00.git and not 2.6.25-rc2.
I know the patch would apply safely because the function that were changed
in that patch haven't changed between them. But some other functions were
moved. So that offset is correct. ;)

Thanks. I hope to have a new patch ready soon.
