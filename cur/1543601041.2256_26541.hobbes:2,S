Hi Nitin,
I am also investigating the iSCSI stuff now, and focusing on the server
side. I found most implementors have no support to authentication and
security. That's the reason why I prefer to the Cisco one, which support
CHAP authentication. But I can't find the server code in their site,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-iscsi/,
 only the driver and daemon on
client side here. So can you tell me where I can get a linux server code
matching this client?
Thank you very much,
Beihong Wu
