The SMP automatic deadlock detection parts of the IKD are extremely
simple, impact none of the mainline code, and are occasionally very
useful.
I've certainly considered integrating those, although if I do (or
preferably if somebody else does ;) I suspect I'd be happier just leaving
them on all the time rather than making them a config option - they are
_that_ non-intrusive.
