Subject: 2.4.18 serial drops characters with 16654

I've got a 2.4.18-10 (RedHat) running on a 2 processor Athlon (1.5Ghz).
If I send data over a PCI 16654 serial card (Connect Tech Blue Heat) and 
RTSCTS flow control is used, characters are dropped.  The drops are 
pretty consistent.  As far as I can tell, the data can only be lost in 
the driver (I'm re-trying the write until all the data gets out).
If I use a 16550, then everything is fine.  Unfortunely, I can't get rid 
of the 16654s.
If is use a 1 processor Athlon running 2.4.9-34 (RedHat), then 
everything is fine.
I haven't been about to test the 2.4.18 SMP system in single processor 
mode, because the IO-APIC goes nuts.  But that's another bug...
Anybody know why the serial driver is losing data?
I'm not on linux-kernel, so please reply directly.
