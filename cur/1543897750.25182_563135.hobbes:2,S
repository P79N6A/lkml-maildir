The exact same argument was made prior to SELinux going upstream.
Look, if you can't be right, try at least to be original.

Just like all the SELinux userland magically appeared in everyone's
distribution? Nope, didn't happen.

No. You are out of line and spewing ignorance.

Duh. Those are pretty much the reasons anyone goes through the
trouble of getting anything upstream.

They reflect the corporate reality of the open source community.
If you're going to go down the "open source isn't for money"
rathole please take it elsewhere. I've heard the arguments so many
times I can sing them to the tune of "Lady Madonna".

Believe what you will. Crispin has been working with LSM from the
inception those many years ago. He's been working on getting this
module in for over a year. If you don't like his module go write
your own and put him out of business.
