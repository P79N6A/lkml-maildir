Some time ago I noticed that tsk->timeout was misused in the kernel
because we was supposing that tsk->timeout == 0 would mean no-timeout,
while instead it means that jiffy is near to wrap around.
This was the main reason why I implemented schedule_timeout() (don't
forget that it's been Ingo the first who mentioned the schedule_timeout
idea).
The nice side effect is that we taken out from schedule() some code from a
fast path and now the additional code is executed only on demand.
We also removed a unsigned long from the task struct and now we put it on
the stack only when needed.
Also the code generated by schedule_timeout() is cleaner according to me
(compared to the old tsk->timeout field).
I posted all the relevant information about schedule_timeout() on the list
at the time of the kenrel inclusion.
