In Solaris you don't even need to define a swap device at all.
If your sure that you will never reach lotsfree (for that matter, nothing
stops you from setting lotsfree, desfree and minfree to whatever value you
want) Solaris will happily run without a swap device even defined.
Once you reach the lotsfree watermark it's a whole different story, then it
makes perfect sense to queue up writes to the swap device and write
them out to swap in a sensible way as you point out above, but when I made
the comment above, I was referring to a system that is not low on memory.
