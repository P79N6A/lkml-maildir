I think Ingo was looking into them. I'm just in the middle of
building a new setup to investigate some performance issues too,
so I hope to look at this.
Apparently it did go unnoticed during CFS testing, unfortunately.
Although now it has been brought to light, I think 2.6.24 is
supposed to be better (although it now gets worse on other things).
