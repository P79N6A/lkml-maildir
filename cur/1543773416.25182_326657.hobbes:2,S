Well, they don't _have_ to upgrade their kernel :)

This was caused by an unfortunate assumption in older versions of udev
about what was contained in the sysfs tree.  udev is now fixed to not
make that assumption.  So this was not a kernel bug, but a udev/libsysfs
one (and I wasn't going to keep the old kernel behavior for this minor
issue.)
As for working with people's boxes, only the very oldest versions of
udev (like the reported 030 version which is a year old and I do not
think shipped by any distro) would have the "lockup" issue.  On all of
the other ones, only custom rules written by users would have issues
(meaning, not work).  I do not know of any shipping, supported distro
that currently has a boot lockup issue (if so, please let me know.)
