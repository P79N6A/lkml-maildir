Chris,
people should, before insulting us publicly or make unsubstantiated 
claims that we "lie" or engage in "illegal" actions, perhaps consult a 
lawyer, and simultaneously use the opportunity to enquire about the 
meaning of "slander".
I repeat, the \0 is purely a technical workaround, done without any 
mischievous intent. Parts of the modules are indeed GPL, and the linked 
in binary-only modem code isn't. We didn't try to hide anything since 
the code containing the workaround is open-source, and we even 
explained back in February the purpose of this workaround on the public 
hsflinux mailing list, while suggesting that a patch should be sent to 
effectively take care of the problem. I even apologized to Rusty for 
not sending that patch ourselves.
Cordially
Marc
