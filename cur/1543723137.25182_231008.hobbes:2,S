Greetings,
I just bought a new FingerWorks TouchStream LP Dvorak Keyboard and when it is plugged in experience the following issues:
The device is identified and promptly puts USB HID into an infinite detection/error loop.
If another USB HID device is plugged in the error occurs once and stops -- leaving the keyboard functional.
But the Java "MultiTouch" software for programming the keyboard fails to detect it.
After detection the additional USB Device can be unplugged.
The necessity to plug in a second device crops up again periodically during use....
NOTE: This keyboard does work flawlessy on Mac OSX and on the same system in Windows 2000.
My dmesg has been flooded with these error messages -- so instead I have attached my kernel log for this most recent boot.
I have also attached my kernel configuration and /proc/bus/usb/devices.  These files are tbz'd to maz_usb.tar.bz2
Brief of the dmesg error:

Thank you for taking the time to read this and if you need any additional information just ask.

PS:  On a unrelated issue that I've noticed with all of my systems running 2.6.x -- the following occurs and makes it so audio CDs can no longer be played without a reboot -- any way to get around this without a reboot?  ::
hdd: DMA timeout retry
hdd: timeout waiting for DMA
hdd: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdd: status timeout: error=0xd0LastFailedSense 0x0d 
hdd: drive not ready for command
hdd: ATAPI reset complete
hdd: lost interrupt
cdrom: dropping to single frame dma  <----  that seems to mess things up good!
