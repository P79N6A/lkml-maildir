Hmm. Seems to work reasonably well on a non-rt kernel -- I get quite a
few overruns, but nothing more than the Zmodem protocol can handle.
It seems to be very sensitive to network traffic though...could it have
something to do with softirq scheduling? Could you try the patch below
and see if you can trigger the error message?
