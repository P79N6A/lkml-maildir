I upgraded to 2.6.17-rc5-mm2 and dispite a small BUG being reported at
boot by the Marvell SATA driver I was able to create the array and use
it. I'm still testing this setup, but so far it seems to work nicely.
I'll send the maintainer of the Marvell SATA driver the BUG message.
Thanks again.
Kind regards,
Tom Wirschell
