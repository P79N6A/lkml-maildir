Tried to post this from another account yesterday but it
seemed to go awol :)
I had a similar problem when I moved from 2.4.1 to 2.4.2
with a tecra 8000. 
The solution was to use 2.4.2ac20 which appears to solve
the problem. The opl3 code changed between kernel
versions.No BIOS or modules.conf were harmed....
Rgds,
