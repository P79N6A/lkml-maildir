   There's one massive missing feature in devfs:  I can't union-mount it
   over an ext2 fs and have it inherit and propagate permissions and
   ownerships down to the underlying layer.  Devfs works just fine
   without it (If there were problems with it, I'd not have been able to
   do my patches to the memory detection code, because major number
   creep breaks too many things otherwise.)
   There are people on the list who, at least from what they write,
   might be able to put this functionality in without even breaking a
   sweat, but until devfs is in the kernel (at a whopping 33k space
   penalty -- 12k in bzImage -- as of 2.3.19) it's a bit optimistic
   to assume that they'll carefully hand-patch their kernels, add
   the unionfs, and tweak vfs to fit for every single kernel release
   from now until the time the core team votes to allow this feature
   in.
   If 2.3 is now feature frozen, this is distressing.  It means that
   I'll have to not port Mastodon to 2.4, but will have to stick with
   2.0.28+logo, because I'm not going to upgrade to a kernel that
   doesn't use such a vital piece of functionality.
