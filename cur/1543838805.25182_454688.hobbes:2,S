What is missing is the abiltity to map a clock to a posix clock, so that 
you would have CLOCK_REALTIME/CLOCK_MONOTONIC as NTP controlled clocks and 
other CLOCK_* as the raw clock.
At some point I tried to discuss such possibilities, but it probably 
wasn't relevant for the rt kernel, so it was utterly ignored. :(
bye, Roman
