Subject: is "pci_find_subsys" safe to remove?

  it's not just that it falls under the category of PCI "legacy" but,
if you look in drivers/pci/search.c near the bottom:
...
#ifdef CONFIG_PCI_LEGACY
EXPORT_SYMBOL(pci_find_device);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(pci_find_slot);
#endif /* CONFIG_PCI_LEGACY */
...
that symbol is not being exported even *if* you select PCI_LEGACY.
i'm guessing that's an oversight but it would certainly suggest that
no one can possibly be using it, no?
