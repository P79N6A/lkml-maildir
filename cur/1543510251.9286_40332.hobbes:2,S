Here's something else to beware of -- this is what Epox says in their
KP6-BS motherboard manual:

So according to Epox, using -10ns chips is a risk.   They may work,
but the timing is so marginal they may cause intermittent memory
errors, depending on other factors such as design of the motherboard,
temperature, electrical load on the bus, etc.
When I started shopping for PC100 memory, I found that many PC100
memory modules use -10ns chips.  Micron only uses -8ns chips on their
PC100 modules, so I bought Micron.  They were no more expensive than
the competition.
I have not had any memory problems with them.
