You can't ioremap normal memory like that. ioremap is only for MMIO

Better than trying to allocate lots of memory in the kernel (which you 
can't, really), would be to make the userspace application allocate the 
ringbuffer and do DMA from the device to userspace memory. To do this, 
you'll have to either make the device do a separate DMA for every 
contiguous chunk, or better yet make the device support scatter-gather 
DMA so that it can read/write from discontiguous physical blocks of 
memory. Have a look at Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt and 
Documentation/DMA-API.txt, also at the Linux Device Drivers 3rd ed. 
online book, these all have info on how this can be done.
