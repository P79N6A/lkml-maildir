Your proof misses a case and is thus invalid.

In the qla case, the mutex can be acquired by a thread which then waits
for the hardware to do something.  If the hardware locks up, it is
preferable that the system not hang.

/* XXX(hch): crude hack to emulate a down_timeout() */
I assumed that he'd spent enough time thinking about it that fixing it
really wasn't feasible.
