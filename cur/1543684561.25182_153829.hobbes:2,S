This is incorrect.
If variable 'a' is a _global_ variable the compiler cannot (and will
not) assume it is
not changed in the loop. (The function call to schedule() might well
change the global, from the compiler point of view)
It will be reread every loop, even without beeing volatile.
When you have local variables that are/contain pointers to some data,
you need to mark those data fields volatie to make sure they get reread.
