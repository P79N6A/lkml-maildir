Just thought I'd add some positive feedback to this thread, if a bit
late (and not really related to cdrecord).
I updated my laptop to -test11 a couple of hours ago and burnt my first
cd using ide-cd. Not having made (nor planning to make) any benchmarks,
the following is to be taken with a grain of salt:
I used a recent xcdroast with a Matshita (Panasonic) ATAPI CD-RW/DVD-ROM
combo drive (model UJDA740) and was impressed. It Just Worked (TM) and
performance was excellent (at 16x), barely using any cpu at all.
Although ide-scsi has been faithful to me, I'm glad that the legacy
emulated scsi code has finally been replaced in favour of native
ide/atapi. I don't really care whether it's dev=0,0,0 or dev=/dev/cdrom,
though from a HCI point of view, the latter is better, but I definitely
want to thank those responsible. I'm sure that a lot of effort has gone
into making this possible.
My laptop _doesn't have_ any scsi hardware, so why should I then have to
select the scsi tree in my kernel config?? Happily, no more.
