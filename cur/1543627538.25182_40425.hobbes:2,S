Can't you just have the simple single and double loops in mmzone.h,
seperated by a #ifdef CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM?
I like the general abstraction idea of where you're going though.
Is there a for_each_node already? Can't see one:
#define for_each_node(nid) \
	for (nid = 0; nid < numnodes; nid++)
would allow us to change the assumption that nodes are numbered
contiguously, starting from 0, more easily later on ... ?
