Hi Taral,
> It prevents me from using ptrace() to override a syscall :(
Short answer:
    Grab a 2.3.24 kernel and use that.  ptrace() can write on ORIG_EAX
    in that kernel.
Long answer:
    If you just patch your 2.2.13 kernel and remove the offending lines,
    then it will work for friendly programs, but have a security hole
    if the user overwrites ORIG_EAX with an illegal value.  Look at
    arch/i386/kernel/entry.S, entry point "tracesys", in 2.2.13 and
    2.3.24 and compare.  You need the 2.3.24 version.
    The systm call entry code used to not tolerate changes to ORIG_EAX
    and I believe that's why ptrace forbade it.  That code got re-factored
    about 2.1.9 so the original stumbling block is long since in the
    ash can of history.
I'm curious, what are you overriding syscalls for?  I am doing it for
a trace-and-replay debugger.
Michael
