What is more news to me: 
    ( 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
 )
    Q: Why was devfs marked OBSOLETE if udev is not finished yet?
    A: To quote Al Viro (Linux VFS kernel maintainer):
==> - the devfs maintainer/author disappeared and stoped maintaining the code
So, if you allow the question, where [t.h.] have you been in the meantime?

It's kernel code - I think the point is valid.

*thumbs up* You could just become the maintainer of ndevfs. :)
Something's wondering me, though:
FreeBSD "just" (5.0) introduced devfs, so either they are behind The Facts 
(see udev FAQ), or devfs (anylinux/anybsd) is not so bad after all.
