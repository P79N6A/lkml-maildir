Nor does novell, but you have to catch stuff like "mkdir ." at the VFS
layer, as well as socket binds to . or .. and the like. Novell 3 crashes
when sent a request to MKDIR . because  they forgot a special case their
need to fake . and .. to the application layer (DOS like Unix has . and ..)
caused.
That is why I actually think losing . and .. causes special cases and bugs
based on real world events, and several Novell reinstalls.
