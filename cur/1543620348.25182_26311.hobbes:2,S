Thats not really a good idea, and definately not something you want to
rely on. A lot of architectures are still stuck with 4KB pages and
trying to allocate 128KB on larger in one chunk is likely to fail after
the system has been running for a while. On an ia64 with 16KB or 64KB
pages it's fairly likely it will work, but this is not necessarily a
good idea to do for other archs. If you need such a large block of
memory, vmalloc() is the real way to go.
