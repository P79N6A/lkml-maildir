and it puts page or buffer_head in waitqueue instead of just flags.

Why bother to check if (wq->page != page) ?
Yes, without this check waiting process can be waken _before_
wake_up_all(page_waitqueue(page)) but i see no problems here.
In fact, this can happen with clean kernel as well.
Let us suppose page_waitqueue(A) == page_waitqueue(B), and
we have two concurrent unlock_page() on these pages.
unlock_page(A)                       unlock_page(B)
TestClearPageLocked(A)
                                     TestClearPageLocked(B)
                                     wake_up_all(page_waitqueue(B)
                                           wakes up process waiting for A,
                                           it returns from wait_on_page_bit()
                                           because !test_bit(bit_nr, &page->flags)
wake_up_all(page_waitqueue(A)
     waiter already running.
So, I beleive, we need not key parameter in page_wake_function.
If we will put flags in waitqueue, bh_wake_function becomes identical
to page_wake_function, and we do not have to modify wakers at all,
there is no need to push page/buffer_head to wake_up().
So, new key parameter for wake_up becomes unneeded.
Oleg.
