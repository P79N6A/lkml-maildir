Unfortunately there isn't much I can say about this, other than it looks
like the right thing to do.
A lot of these PCI and PNP serial controllers are provided by various
people, and unfortunately no record was kept as to who has what hardware.
Of course, this makes testing these types of changes impossible.
So, the best thing I can suggest is to get the patch into Linus/akpm's
kernel and watch what happens.
