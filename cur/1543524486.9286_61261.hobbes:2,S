    I could get a bit tricky to produce a strace log without a shell,
    I'll try a serial console...
It's actually pretty easy once if you can get a shell on the machine
before the event, once you know the program in question:
mv /path/to/${PROGRAM} /path/to/${PROGRAM}.ORIG
edit /path/to/${PROGRAM}
#!/bin/sh
strace -f -o /tmp/${PROGRAM}.trace /path/to/${PROGRAM}.ORIG $*
I do it all the time to debug network services started from
inetd for example.
