Ok, here's a patch that works for me and makes more sense ;)
What happens is that ub_sync_tur() fails a few times when the device
is inserted. So we end up returning changed = 1 from within the call
to check_disk_change() done by do_open() from the partition code itself,
causing a re-entrance in there... 
I think add_disk() is very fragile here, but I'll let others like viro
(or you :) to fix that.
Anyway, the fix is to better mimmic sd_spinup_disk() within our own
revalidate. I think we _should_ actually request sense & analyze it
properly, eventually sending spinup commands etc... but in the meantime,
a simple retry works well enough for me. Here's the patch:
