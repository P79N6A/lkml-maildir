Subject: 2.6.15-rc1: NET_CLS_U32 not working?

hi,
i noticed that some of my QoS rules are not working any more. oh, i 
forgot to enable CONFIG_NET_CLS_U32. but when enabled, i got the 
following errors when compiling / installing the module:
* Warning: "unregister_tcf_proto_ops" [net/sched/cls_u32.ko] undefined!
* Warning: "register_tcf_proto_ops" [net/sched/cls_u32.ko] undefined!
* Warning: "tcf_exts_dump" [net/sched/cls_u32.ko] undefined!
* Warning: "tcf_exts_dump_stats" [net/sched/cls_u32.ko] undefined!
* Warning: "tcf_exts_change" [net/sched/cls_u32.ko] undefined!
* Warning: "tcf_exts_validate" [net/sched/cls_u32.ko] undefined!
* Warning: "tcf_exts_destroy" [net/sched/cls_u32.ko] undefined!
modprobe...

cls_u32: Unknown symbol tcf_exts_dump_stats
cls_u32: Unknown symbol register_tcf_proto_ops
cls_u32: Unknown symbol tcf_exts_validate
when i disabled CONFIG_NET_CLS_U32, everything compiles fine, but 
cls_u32 is missing of course :-(
all the missing symbols seem to be defined in include/net/pkt_cls.h. but 
  this file is #included by net/sched/cls_u32.c and other too, so i 
don't really know, why it doesn't work.
FWIW, i see EXPORT_SYMBOLs at the very end of net/sched/cls_api.c, but i 
can't see if/when cls_api.c is used (included?) at all.
undoing the PKT_SCHED patch [1] does not really help. the config-file is 
a bit different due to CONFIG_NET_QOS, the errors don't go away.
.config, .config.diff, dmesg, verbose output and more is here:

thanks for looking into that,
Christian.
