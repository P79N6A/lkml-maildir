Wow, that is great!

Did you get the latest code? I have been sick with the flu and I think I 
forgot to send you the latest code to play with. We should get you set up 
so you can merge your changes into our tree and then we can update the 
one in the X.org tree as well (Egbert Eich usually does that from our 
tree).
