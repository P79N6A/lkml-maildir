I have released Framebuffer-HOWTO 1.0pre5.
You can peruse the HOWTO at
	
http://www.tahallah.demon.co.uk/programming/prog.html
Or you may download the tarballs (text, html or sgml formats) directly 
from that URL given above. Sorry, don't have a ftp server unfortunately.
Enjoy, and _please_ _please_ _please_ mail me privately, we don't want to
pollute the l-k mailing list.
I am still seeking information about the PowerPC platforms, ARM
(NetWinders) platforms. Please e-mail me privately if you have information
you could give me so I can include it in the HOWTO. You could get your
name in it! 8)
Finally, I've had two reports about the ATI framebuffer driver - both of
them could not get it to work 8(. Has anyone succeeded in getting this one
to work at all, and if so, please do drop me a line and I can document the
configuration.
Cheers, 
Alex
