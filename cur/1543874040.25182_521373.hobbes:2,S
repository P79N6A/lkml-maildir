(trimmed CC a little bit)
Thomas, could you please provide more information? Did it ever work for 
you after suspend/resume cycle and it just broke at some point in the 
past, or you are not sure whether it ever worked?
Also, what exactly does it mean that it doesn't work? Are both the 
interfaces after resume bound to usbhid driver (you can check this in 
/sys)? When the quirk works correctly, only the keyboard interface should 
be bound to usbhid driver. Please check the binding both before and after 
suspend/resume cycle, and let me know.
Thanks,
