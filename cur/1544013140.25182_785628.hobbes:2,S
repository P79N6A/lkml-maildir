That would be _really_ nice to do IMHO: in many cases putting the __weak 
definition into same-file scope with a call site is a natural approach. I 
think that's how we ended up having so many instances of that bug. When 
you use __weak as a 'default implementation' for some function, then it's 
very natural to put it into the same file that also uses it.
It goes into separate, inactive scope only in a few special cases: such as 
when it's some library function that can be overriden by the architecture. 
But if it's some non-libray kernel code then the usage site is close to 
the definition site.
If you look at most of the __weak fixes they IMO actually turned clean 
code into less clean code: they detached some natural clustering of 
definition and callsite.
And __weak is very elegant IMO, it can avoid a lot of #ifdefs and can be 
used to self-document architecture interfaces - so it would be nice to 
make it always work, regardless of the callsite's scope.
