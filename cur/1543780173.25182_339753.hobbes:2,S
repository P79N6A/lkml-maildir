This seem very broken : in pnp unregister, pnp
will try to free the resource of the device, so you _can't_ safely use the
resource you probe after pnp_unregister_driver.
Please call pnp_unregister_driver in your remove routine.
Also mixing pnp and pci device is a very bad idea. You should try to
split it if you can.
